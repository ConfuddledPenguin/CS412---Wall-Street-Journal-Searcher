   Contrary to "S&amp;L Cleanup Law's Measures Weakened by Court
Rulings, Relaxed Regulations" (Politics and Policy, July 19),
the rules governing the operation of the nation's savings
institutions have not been weakened or relaxed. If anything,
our institutions are operating under some capital standards
that are tighter than those applied to commercial banks.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has not relaxed its
rules. The loans-to-one-borrower transition period referred
to is only available to savings institutions that already
have more capital today than the law requires them to hold in
1995. They are hardly a threat to the deposit insurance fund.

   Also, there is no requirement in the law that savings
institutions hold more capital against certain Veterans
Administration loans (actually the servicing of VA loans in
Government National Mortgage Association pools of mortgages).
The OTS imposed a higher capital requirement on some VA loan
servicing, then rescinded its directive so that it could
follow a congressional mandate to conform capital
requirements for savings institutions with those for national
banks.
