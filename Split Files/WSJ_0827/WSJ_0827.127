   WASHINGTON -- It may be crying time for Wall Street and
stock-market investors, but for regulators things are going
just fine, thank you.
   Despite a partial recovery Friday, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average has dropped almost 16%, with almost-daily
poundings, since July 16 when New York Stock Exchange
officials gathered on the exchange floor. They had planned to
celebrate what they thought would be the first close above
3000 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But the average
ended that day -- and the following tantalizing session -- at
2999.75, and the 28 trading days since have been nightmarish
for most investors.

   But while Wall Street and investors agonize, regulators
are pleased with the way the markets have reacted. A series
of orderly, methodical drops has been easily handled by the
exchanges and back-office systems. Investors have generally
kept their money in equity mutual funds and appear to be
sitting tight with their stock holdings. Clearly, this isn't
1987 when computer-trading strategies helped create wave
after wave of selling until the Dow industrials fell 22.6% in
a single day.
   Most importantly, the five-week bear market has been
driven by major news events rather than oblique market forces
such as program trading, regulators say.
   "Here you had the convergence of two very bad sets of
news, namely, substantially bad earnings and the bad news in
the Middle East," says Richard Ketchum, chief market watcher
for the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Notwithstanding
the two very bad stories, you haven't seen it dramatically
react in one bulge. I think that suggests there is more
stability in the market and that should give more comfort to
investors."
   Today's market is a victim of the military confrontation
with Iraq, the resulting huge jump in oil prices and dire
economic forecasts, regulators note. "I think the market is
reacting pretty rationally to very dramatic news," says SEC
Commissioner Mary Schapiro. "The drop for the most part has
been very orderly."
   Regulators note that the October 1987 crash of 508 points
caused more carnage on a percentage basis in a stunning 6 1/2
hours. Moreover, it left an air of panic from which many
individual investors still haven't recovered.
   "The {recent} changes have come in response to information
and events, and average people out there see those things
more easily," contends Wendy Gramm, chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the stockindex
futures market. "It's more easily understandable to them.
When people don't understand, it becomes much tougher."
   That's not to say the markets haven't been volatile. Price
moves have been sharp and quick during much of the past five
weeks, often in response to announcements or rumors about
U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Eight times since Aug.
2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Dow industrials have moved
more than 50 points in a day.
   "While there certainly has been a lot of intraday
volatility and prices have bounced around a lot, the markets
have moved in 30- to 90-point intervals rather than big
185-point moves," says Mr. Ketchum. "That has given people
more time to react to the market and less time to panic."
   Slow, steady drops are substantially easier for the
behind-the-scenes operations at Wall Street firms,
clearinghouses and exchanges to handle. This year, unlike in
1987, firms and exchanges haven't been forced to shorten
trading hours to handle massive order flows. Margin calls, by
which investors are asked to put up more money for securities
bought on credit, are more orderly in this environment. And
market makers report that although they have sustained losses
during the slide, they aren't in dire need of capital.
   One key element in the smoother performance, regulators
note, has been the introduction of "circuit breakers" into
the stock and futures markets. The most frequently used one
prevents market participants from trading Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock-index futures at lower prices for 30 minutes after
the index has fallen 12 points. Those futures, which
represent a bet on the 500-stock basket, are frequently used
in computerized program trades.
   Moreover, earlier this month the Big Board instituted a
rule that bars most program traders from operating any time
the Dow industrials fall by 50 points. The SEC gave tepid
approval to the rule several weeks ago, saying that it was
obligated to allow exchanges to try new processes but voiced
concerns whether the 50-point threshold might be breached too
often.
   But the Big Board's rule appears to have helped brake
sharp drops, regulators say. While Mr. Ketchum says he's
uneasy about endorsing the New York Exchange's rule, he
notes, "Our impression is that New York's arbitrage
restriction results in substantially reducing the amount of
arbitrage once it goes into place. And on a number of
occasions the market has turned after that has occurred."
   The benefit, he adds, is that the circuit breakers have
kept the futures market from "overshooting" the level at
which fundamentals suggest it should be. In the prior two big
drops, the SEC has said, the futures markets overshot their
"normal" levels and dragged stocks down with them. Circuit
breakers halt the futures activity or keep it from
overshooting, he said.
   Indeed, a senior Federal Reserve official, who says he was
initially skeptical about the value of circuit breakers,
believes they have worked surprisingly well over the last few
weeks.
   But he and others note that it is too early to declare
victory over runaway markets. They worry that a shooting war
in the Middle East, for instance, still could slam the U.S.
investment markets.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Edward Markey, who heads the House
subcommittee that oversees the SEC, thinks the latest market
drop, along with the jump in oil prices, will push Congress
to move on "financially prudent legislation."
   "Combined with the S&amp;L bailout, this is a clear signal
that we will be moving into a more prudent and financially
conservative era," Rep. Markey contends. "It will allow us to
put on the books prudent policies" to rein excesses of the
1980s, he adds.
   The Massachussetts Democrat says the market's drop will
help propel Congress to "move forward a lot of the
market-reform legislation we have put forward this year as
well as lay the groundwork for additional legislation later
on." Several securities-related bills are pending, including
legislation that would allow the SEC to ban some forms of
program trading and give the agency the clout to seek more
data from brokerage firms.
   But generally, Mr. Markey appears to be satisfied with the
pace of the stock market's decline. "Although it is not
something we would welcome in terms of its comment on the
state of our economy or the prospects," he said, "it is
infinitely preferable to the Maalox moments that we had in
the markets in 1987 and 1989."
