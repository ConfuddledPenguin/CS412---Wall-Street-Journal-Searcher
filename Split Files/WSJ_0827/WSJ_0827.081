   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of
American Continental Corp., and five other top officers of
the company resigned Friday, leaving unclear who would assume
the helm.
   Mr. Keating had been hanging on to his post in the hopes
that a lawsuit he filed would invalidate the government's
takeover of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, American
Continental's main operating unit.

   He resigned one day after a federal judge dismissed Mr.
Keating's challenge to the government takeover of Lincoln
S&amp;L, saying that he and other associates looted Lincoln of
tens of millions of dollars.
   Judge Stanley Sporkin's ruling was the first court test of
federal regulators' claims that Mr. Keating transferred funds
from Lincoln to American Continental, which in turn paid
multimillion-dollar salaries to Mr. Keating and other
officials. "Bluntly speaking," Judge Sporkin wrote in his
decision, "their actions amounted to a looting of Lincoln."
   The government has said that the failure of Lincoln, one
of the biggest thrift debacles, could cost taxpayers more
than $2 billion. Thrift regulators had been seeking to remove
Mr. Keating as chairman of American Continental, along with
the five other officers, for some time. The regulators filed
a motion in December to name a court-appointed trustee to
succeed Mr. Keating.
   According to a spokeswoman, Mr. Keating wasn't available
to comment on his resignation. But a statement from his
lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, said that "it has become clear that
my client must now concentrate all his energy on aggressively
defending the legal charges against him."
   Mr. Keating faces a government civil fraud suit filed by
the Resolution Trust Corp. seeking $1.1 billion from him and
other executives of Lincoln, which is based in Irvine, Calif.
And, the Office of Thrift Supervision has filed
administrative charges against Mr. Keating and the five other
officials, seeking $40.9 million in restitution.
   Lincoln, which Mr. Keating bought in 1984, was seized by
the government in April 1989, one day after American
Continental filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The other officers who resigned are: Judy J. Wischer,
president; Robert J. Kielty and Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr.
(who is Mr. Keating's son-in-law), both of whom are listed in
the company's 1988 proxy as senior vice presidents; Andrew F.
Ligget, chief financial officer; and Bradley J. Boland, the
company's spokesman (and another of Mr. Keating's
sons-in-law).
