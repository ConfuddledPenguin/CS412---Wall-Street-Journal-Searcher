   DETROIT -- As the United Auto Workers union prepares to
select a "target" company for negotiating a new three-year
contract, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. put sharply
different offers on the table.
   Ford offered to negotiate improved job security and to
boost pensions for its UAW workers. Meanwhile, Chrysler asked
its UAW-represented employees to accept substantial
concessions in benefits. The offer virtually ensures that the
union will not select Chrysler to set the pattern for its
negotiations with the Big Three auto makers. Among the offers
submitted, General Motors Corp. was the only one to propose a
base wage increase.

   Ford's offer includes unspecified lump-sum payments, but
no base wage increases. The auto maker also wants the union
to allow it to offer incentives to employees to move into
health maintenance organizations or preferred provider plans.
   Chrysler made its initial offer to the UAW Friday, while
Ford and GM submitted their proposals Thursday. The UAW is
bargaining separately with each of them, and is set to select
by tomorrow one of the three as its target for negotiating a
pattern-setting pact. The union will work to reach agreement
with the target company by Sept. 14, when contracts with all
three companies expire. After reaching agreement, the union
will then press the two other companies to agree to virtually
identical terms.
   Traditionally, the UAW chooses as its target the company
that best suits its objectives and strategies for the
negotiations. The union has said that obtaining job security
for its 450,000 members who work for the Big Three auto
makers will be its top objective in talks this year. It's
been widely speculated that GM will be the target this year
because the company has nearly twice as many UAW members as
Ford and Chrysler combined, and the No. 1 auto maker has
continually crossed swords with the UAW over job security.
Perhaps more important, the union's strongest personality is
Stephen Yokich, who heads the union's GM department.
   GM's offer last week included increased base wages, and
expanded benefits for workers it lays off, but didn't include
broader job guarantees for UAW members. In contrast, Ford
said it is willing to tackle the issue of job security, but
didn't provide any definitive proposal.
   Chrysler's offer drew sharp criticism from UAW officials
because, unlike the offers of GM and Ford, Chrysler's offer
seeks "givebacks." The No. 3 auto maker asked UAW bargainers
to move their workers out of their traditional Blue Cross and
Blue Shield healthcare coverage and into health maintenance
organizations and preferred provider plans.
   The auto maker also asked the union to drop the
requirement that Chrysler hire one worker for every two it
loses through attrition. Stan Marshall, the UAW's top
Chrysler bargainer, signaled his disappointment by walking
out of the bargaining room without discussion almost
immediately after Chrysler presented the offer.
   Chrysler's offer "more or less left (Mr. Marshall)
speechless," a UAW official said.
