   TOKYO -- Japan's production of cars, buses and trucks in
July soared 10.1% from a year earlier to 1.2 million units
from 1.1 million, marking the second-largest year-to-year
percentage gain for a month and a record total for the month
of July, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
reported.
   The record year-to-year gain was a 10.8% jump in May. In
June, by comparison, output slipped 1%.

   Domestic sales, growing 8.3% to 766,174 units in July,
fueled the rise, the association said. Export figures are
expected to show a 3% gain.
