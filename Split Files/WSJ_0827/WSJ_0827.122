   DEAUVILLE, France -- France's top horse-flesh market took
a big hit from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The six-day auction of thoroughbreds here this past week
attracted winning bids totaling 112.7 million French francs
($21.7 million), down 16% from last year's total of 134.5
million francs, organizers said.

   According to observers, breeders from Kuwait and other
Gulf states -- big buyers at past auctions -- were
conspicuous by their absence this year. Japanese and other
Asian buyers only partly made up the difference, including a
bid of 6.5 million francs for one horse by a Japanese
shipping magnate.
   According to the French Thoroughbred Sales Agency, which
organizes the annual sale, 375 horses were sold this year, at
an average price of 286,679 francs, compared with 413 horses
sold last year for an average of 325,750 francs.
