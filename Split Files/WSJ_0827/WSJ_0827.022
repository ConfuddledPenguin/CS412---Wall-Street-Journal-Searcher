   MALMOE, Sweden -- Since arriving in Sweden 10 days ago,
Sahra Hassan and her four children have been shuttled from a
tent camp to a converted cruise ship in Malmoe's harbor
because refugee housing is scarce.
   Now, Ms. Hassan, whose husband is fighting with rebel
forces against the Somali government, fears that new rules
restricting asylum will force her to move again -- back to
Africa.

   "If we go home, we die," she says.
   Sweden, long famed as a sanctuary for U.S. draft
resisters, Chilean dissidents and other exiles, is rapidly
closing its doors. With the number of asylum-seekers soaring,
and its generous welfare state already strained, Sweden has
effectively sealed its southern sea border and stepped up
deportations of recent arrivals.
   "It is sad, but Sweden cannot keep trying to solve all the
world's problems on its own," says Marleen Andersson, an
immigration official in Malmoe. Gazing wearily at the mound
of asylum applications on her desk, she says about 80% of
such requests were granted last year. In 1990, she expects
the rate to be half that.
   Swedish officials point out that they have long taken more
than their share. Last year, 30,000 refugees poured into the
country. In neighboring Finland, the figure was 174. There
now is about one refugee in Sweden for every 50 natives.
   But the change in Sweden also reflects the anti-immigrant
sentiment sweeping across Europe. Isolated, bland and
overwhelmingly blond, Sweden always was an awkward haven for
exiles from war and famine-torn Third World nations. Now,
hostility towards "svartskallar" -- blackheads -- is
increasingly coming out of the closet.
   "There is a good climate in Africa and the Middle East, so
why can't people make a good life there?" asks Carl Herzlow,
a right-wing politician and popular radio host in Malmoe.
Answering his own question, he says, "these people don't
work, that's why."
   Echoing the view of many European officials, Mr. Herzlow
says the money spent on settling refugees could be used more
efficiently in the form of foreign aid. "Houses in the Middle
East are much lighter than in Sweden," he says. "For every
one we build here, we could put up 10 in Africa."
   Such talk strikes a chord among young Swedes, many of whom
now wait months for housing and other services. During May
and June, there were repeated firebombings of refugee camps
across Sweden. At a mosque in Malmoe, young Swedes have
smashed the imam's car and threatened Moslems by mail and
phone.
   Liberal-minded Swedes fear their country has betrayed its
role as a conscience to the Western world. "We are still
small and rich, we don't have the excuses of a Germany or
England," says Nils Sjoestrom, a Baptist pastor who works
with refugees in the southern port of Trelleborg. "If we
don't offer refuge anymore, who will?"
   The answer, for now, is that no one is likely to pick up
the slack. Until June, refugees poured into Trelleborg aboard
boats from East Germany, a common transit point for travelers
from Africa and the Middle East. Now, Sweden regards East
Germany as a country of "first asylum," so refugees arriving
from Germany can now be sent back to seek refuge in Berlin. A
similar ruling earlier this year allowed Sweden to turn back
hundreds of refugees arriving by boat from Poland. In March
and April, as many as 500 refugees arrived by boat each day
in southern Swedish ports. In late July, the average was 35.
   Robleh Ali and three other young Somalis had the bad luck
to arrive from East Germany just hours after the new rule
took effect. They spent two nights in a Trelleborg apartment
before being put back on a boat. "They are East Germany's
responsibility now, not ours," says the deporting officer,
assistant police chief Leif Pegreus. He adds that they were
"economic refugees" rather than political exiles. Except in
rare cases, Sweden now hews to the Geneva Convention
definition of a refugee as someone with a "well-founded fear"
of persecution or imprisonment in his own country.
   To Mr. Ali, such distinctions seem strange. With a civil
war that has destroyed the Somali economy and resulted in
thousands of civilian deaths, "the police do not need to
arrest me," he says. "The whole country is already a prison."
   The 21-year-old student and his friends fled their
hometown, Hargeisa, on foot and walked for 10 days through
the bush to reach Djibouti. There, they paid several hundred
dollars for crudely forged Djibouti passports. Mr. Ali later
spent the rest of his money on a frayed black tuxedo jacket,
during a stopover in Cairo. "I was told in Europe they wear
nice clothes," explains the youth, who chose Sweden as a
destination because fellow Somalis told him it was "peaceful
and nice to refugees."
   Mr. Ali's first view of Europe was a dingy East Berlin
train station where hundreds of East Europeans, many of them
gypsies, bed down each night because they have nowhere else
to go.
   It was to the train station that the Somalis returned
after being deported from Sweden. "I do not speak German, I
do not know any Germans," Mr. Ali says, counting what's left
of the money given to him by a generous Swede: $40, to be
split four ways. Unable to find any officials to help them,
and bewildered by the chaos and anti-immigrant feeling in
Berlin, the group eventually decides to find a way back to
Africa.
   "There is no place for us to run now," Mr. Ali says,
"except maybe the moon."
