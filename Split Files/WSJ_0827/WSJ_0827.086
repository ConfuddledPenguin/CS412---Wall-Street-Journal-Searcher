   DALLAS -- Amid signs that some investors may be holding
out for a better deal, Southland Corp. again extended its
debt-swap offer after falling far short of obtaining
bondholder approval to complete a $430 million bailout
proposed by its Japanese partners.
   Southland extended the offer to Sept. 12, three days
before the scheduled expiration of its proposed deal with
Ito-Yokado Co., the Japanese operator of Southland's 7-Eleven
convenience stores.

   To complete the transaction, which would give Ito-Yokado a
70% stake in Southland, the convenience-store chain needs
approval from bondholders representing 95% of the bonds
outstanding in each of five debt issues. When the first
extension of the offer expired last Thursday, Southland had
received tenders from holders of 46% of its 18% notes, 46.3%
of its 16.75% notes, 64% of its 16.5% notes, 65.9% of its
15.75% notes, and 89.9% of its 13.5% senior notes. Only
holders of the company's preferred stock exceeded the
minimums required in the complex deal, tendering 90.9% of the
shares outstanding. Only two-thirds approval of preferred
shareholders was required.
   "We plan to intensify our efforts to communicate with
those bondholders who have not yet tendered and expect
continued progress during the extension," said Clark
Matthews, Southland's chief financial officer. According to
John Gordon, president of Deltec Securities Corp. and
chairman of the Southland bondholder committee, at least one
big holder, with 12% of each of two issues, has been on
vacation and couldn't be contacted.
   Yet merely extending the offer may not be enough. William
Eddleman Jr. of Dallas-based Barre &amp; Co., a holder along with
its clients of about $30 million in Southland bonds, said,
"Officially, we're telling our clients we'd like to see if
there's going to be a better deal."
   "Anybody holding out for a better deal is totally
unreasonable, considering the economic environment we're in
now," countered Mr. Gordon, whose committee rejected three
earlier Southland offers before approving the fourth and
latest one. Calling it "the best deal that can be gotten,"
Mr. Gordon predicted that it would receive bondholder
approval by Sept. 12.
   Southland's current offer would give bondholders about 25%
of the company's common stock. The founding Thompson family
of Dallas would get about 5% of the stock.
   Southland went into default on its $1.8 billion of
publicly traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced
into filing for bankruptcy-law protection when the bondholder
committee endorsed the terms of its most recent exchange
offer.
   The company, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
threatened hostile takeover. But increased competition eroded
sales and profit margins and made it difficult for the
company to service the huge debt from the buy-out.
