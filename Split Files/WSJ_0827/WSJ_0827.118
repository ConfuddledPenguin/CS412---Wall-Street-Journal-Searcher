   WASHINGTON -- The American Newspaper Publishers
Association estimated July newsprint consumption by all U.S.
users at 989,533 metric tons, up 4% from a year earlier.
   The trade group said consumption by U.S. daily newspapers
was little changed at 718,651 metric tons, compared with
719,080 tons in July 1989. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.
