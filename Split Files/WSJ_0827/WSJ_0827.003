   When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.
   The stock market's tough guys nowadays are the "value"
investors, who seek out undervalued stocks. They lagged the
rising stock market for 19 months, arguing that nearly every
stock was fairly priced at best or outrageously overvalued at
worst. But with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 15% in
little more than a month, the market's bargain basement is
back in business.

   Value investors were bottom-fishing all last week, but on
Friday they dominated the action, pushing the Dow industrials
up 49.50 points to 2532.92 following a 173-point sinking
spell during the preceding three days.
   "If you can't find bargains in this environment, you
aren't trying," says value investor Donald Yacktman. On
Friday, Mr. Yacktman bought stocks for himself and for some
private accounts he manages, but he didn't do any buying for
the $360 million mutual fund he runs, Selected American
Shares. "I couldn't," he says. "I didn't have any money to
buy with" because he already had invested most of it. "I'm
down to about one tenth of 1% in cash."
   "It's kind of like revenge of the nerds," says Kurt
Brouwer, an investment adviser with San Francisco's Brouwer &amp;
Janachowski Inc. "The boring guys who were buying undervalued
companies weren't doing well in the booming market. Now
they're starting to do well relative to the market."
   That's a turnaround from a month ago, when growth-stock
pickers were flying high. "The growth guys had a wonderful
time in the second quarter," says Andrew Massie, manager of
$70 million Counsellors Capital Appreciation, a no-load fund
that invests in medium-sized growth companies. "Now they're
being taken out and shot, one by one."
   Value investors generally keep their eyes glued to
corporate balance sheets, hunting for undervalued real
estate, overfunded pension funds, understated inventories and
brand names that are carried on the books for a fraction of
their real worth. They tend to prefer low-debt companies that
generate more cash than is needed to keep their businesses
running.
   Growth-stock pickers, on the other hand, look for firms
with rapidly growing earnings, and frequently don't mind if
the company has to borrow money to finance that growth.
Growth stocks often perform best when the future seems
brightest. Now, of course, the future seems anything but
bright.
   "For most stock market investors, we're driven by
fundamentals," says Mr. Massie, "Now, we're driven by
politics, by fear, by the Middle East. That's what's driving
prices."
   Adds Mr. Massie, "Most of the people investing today
haven't seen a stock market faced with war. What's happened
in the last six weeks? We've had a few bad economic
indicators. So what's driven the market down 500 points? It's
fear of war."
   The Middle East crisis has battered virtually all stock
mutual funds, but growth-stock funds have been hit
particularly hard. According to Lipper Analytical Services of
New York, the average stock fund is down 15.9% since the
market peak of mid-July. But many top growth funds have been
hit much harder than that. Twentieth Century Growth is down
22.6% since the market peak, and the Pasadena Growth Fund is
off 25.2%.
   The Mideast situation bashed growth stocks badly because
of general uncertainty and specific concern about the economy
going into recession, which would eviscerate already-lean
corporate profits. That's a deadly condition for growth
stocks, which investors buy in expectation of rapidly rising
profits.
   But growth stocks have also been hit by the recent jump in
interest rates. "Growth stocks -- more than any other type of
stock -- are affected by rapidly rising interest rates,"
points out value investor William Miller, who runs Legg Mason
Special Investment Trust. As bond yields spike upward, it
makes less sense to pay a premium price for corporate
earnings that won't materialize for two or three years, if
then.
   "The uncertainty caused by recession or inflation or fear
of war makes your comfort level with future earnings go down
at the same time that your discount rate goes up," says value
investor Richard Fontaine, manager of Baltimore's Fontaine
Capital Appreciation Fund. "It's a double whammy."
   Growth-stock picker Stephen Poling, the chief investment
officer at AMEV Advisers, isn't worried about earnings for
the stocks he owns. "The earnings of our companies are doing
very well," says Mr. Poling. "That's what growth stocks are
meant to do. The problem is not the earnings, but rather what
investors will pay for earnings."
   Some growth-stock managers have raised huge quantities of
cash. Brandywine Fund now has 64% of its assets in cash, and
Janus Fund has 75% cash. This month, Mr. Poling and Mr.
Massie haven't done much selling, but they haven't done any
buying, either.
   "We're not going to be buying aggressively until we see
what happens in the Middle East," says Mr. Massie. "I think
the odds are greater than 50% that we'll have a war. I hope
I'm wrong."
   Many value investors, meanwhile, are piling back into the
stock market. "I feel totally comfortable being 100% invested
these days," says Mr. Yacktman of Selected American Shares.
"People probably think I'm nuts." Mr. Yacktman has been
loading up on newspaper stocks, such as Washington Post,
Gannett and Times Mirror, as well as two government-sponsored
finance agencies, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and
Student Loan Marketing Association.
   Why are value investors charging in where growth-stock
pickers fear to tread? "Bonds got cheaper, but stocks got
even cheaper," notes Donald Schmidt, manager of Bartlett
Capital Basic Value. "If something is good value, if you can
buy something with demonstrable earning power, and you can
buy it at five times earnings, that sure seems more
attractive to me than money-market instruments. The important
question is, why is something cheap? If it's cheap because
people are dumping stocks, that sure doesn't seem like a good
reason."
   Many value-oriented fund managers headed into August
holding a bundle of cash, but few were as bearish as Mr.
Fontaine. He went into July with 65% of his fund in cash,
hiking his cash hoard to 90% by early August.
   Mr. Fontaine uses the price-to-book value of Standard &amp;
Poor's 400-stock index to judge whether the market is
overvalued. In July, it hit 2.8 times book value, higher even
than 1987. "That's well past what I consider reasonable,"
says Mr. Fontaine, who also managed to avoid the October 1987
carnage. At that time, he was just 22% invested in stocks.
   Mr. Fontaine is starting to buy, and his fund is now 30%
invested. He has been nibbling at such stocks as Charming
Shoppes, Fleetwood Enterprises, Loews and New York Times. All
have taken a beating in the recent sell-off. But Mr. Fontaine
thinks many stock still have further to fall.
   "You'd be a fool to be buying the stocks that held up like
Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, the oil stocks in general, the
drugs, some of the bio-tech stocks that have held up, General
Electric," says Mr. Fontaine. "These are good companies, but
they're not reflecting the fact that the world has changed,
that we're going into a recession and that we're going to
have higher inflation. I think the market is headed down to
the low 2000 range."
   Earlier this month, value investor Peter Cundill was over
50% in cash, largely Canadian Treasury bills. "Back in
mid-July, I was feeling very blue, the growth stocks were
going up and I was sitting on all this cash," says Mr.
Cundill, who runs a top-performing Canadian mutual fund, the
Cundill Value Fund.
   Now Mr. Cundill is putting that cash to work. He boasts,
"I just bought my first Japanese stock in five years":
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the giant consumer
electronics firm.
                                                                                                       

   Friday's Market Activity

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 49.50 points in
active trading to close at 2532.92, trimming the loss for the
week to 111.88, or 4.2%. That was the average's worst weekly
performance since October, resulting from heightening
tensions in the Mideast and soaring oil prices.
   Traders said some of the strength Friday came from short
sellers buying stocks to replace those they had borrowed and
sold in anticipation of price declines, coupled with some
bargain-hunting. But the strength wasn't enough to erase all
the hefty losses posted throughout the week.
   Broader market measures also posted gains Friday. Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.45 to 311.51; the New York
Stock Exchange composite index added 2.17 to 171.05, and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index climbed 4.41 to 288.54. All
three were off about 5% for the week. On the Big Board,
volume was 199 million shares and advancers led decliners,
956 to 649. The market has now fallen for six consecutive
weeks.
   Despite the rally Friday in most share prices, stocks of
some of the major oil companies followed crude oil prices
lower. The October contract for crude oil fell $1.02 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange to $30.91 a barrel.
   Chevron lost 1 3/8 to 74 1/4; Amoco dropped 1 3/4 to 54;
Royal Dutch Petroleum declined 1 3/8 to 78 3/4, and Exxon
fell 3/4 to 48 7/8. Texaco added 3/8 to 60 1/2.
   Federal National Mortgage Association surged 2 3/8 to 29,
while the association's warrants rose 2 3/8 to 15 1/8. Fannie
Mae said it would buy back as much as $500 million of its
stock and warrants.
   AmBase jumped 3/8 to 2 3/8. The insurance and financial
services holding company signed a letter of intent to sell a
controlling interest to an investor group for $4 a share.
   Other big gainers were Harken Energy, up 5/8 to 4; Germany
Fund, up 1 7/8 to 12 3/8, and R.O.C. Taiwan Fund, up 1 to 5
7/8.
   Among the top percentage losers, CF Income Partners fell
1/2 to 2 7/8. Hadson, an energy and defense concern, fell 1/4
to 1 3/4. Idex, an industrial products company, dropped 1 1/4
to 11 3/8, and Worldcorp, an airline holding company, fell
3/8 to 4 1/4.
   The most actively traded Big Board issue was Philip
Morris, up 1 7/8 to 43 3/4. Also among the 10 most active was
General Electric, up 2 7/8 to 61 3/8.
   International Business Machines rose 3 1/2 to 100 3/8 on a
report in this newspaper that the company is about to
introduce a new mainframe computer.
   General Motors was up 1 1/8 to 37 3/8.
   United Technologies rose 1 7/8 to 48 3/4. AMR was up 1 3/8
to 45 3/4. Boeing soared 3 3/8 to 45 7/8.
