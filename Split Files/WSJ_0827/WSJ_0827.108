   General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac, Chevrolet and Buick
divisions set rebates of as much as $1,250 for most
1991-model cars that are only now arriving in dealer
showrooms. The three incentive programs took effect Friday
and are scheduled to run until Sept. 24.
   GM's Oldsmobile division said Thursday that it was
discounting many of its 1991 models with rebates as high as
$1,500.

   Incentives offered by Buick ranged from $250 to $1,250.
The highest Buick discount is on the top-of-the-line versions
of its midsized Regal. Buick also said it is offering buyers
the option of taking special financing rates as low as 3.9%
on 24-month loans.
   GM is also offering $1,000 off the Chevrolet Caprice and
Camaro, the Geo Prizm and Tracker and the Pontiac Firebird.
   Auto makers have increasingly turned to putting incentives
on new vehicles before the start of a model year to overcome
consumer wariness about price increases.
