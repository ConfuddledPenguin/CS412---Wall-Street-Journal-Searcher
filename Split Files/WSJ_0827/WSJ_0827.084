   The world of business has been transformed in many ways by
video technology, from teleconferencing to televised sales
pitches. Now, James D. Donahue has taken the technology one
step further.
   At a bizarre meeting held Thursday for more than 500
investors of Hedged Securities Associates Inc., Mr. Donahue,
the Englewood, Colo., firm's founder, confessed to losing
more than $100 million of their money through risky stock
options trading, primarily involving shares of UAL Corp. But,
fearful for his personal safety, Mr. Donahue didn't deliver
his confession in person -- he did it on video.

   As a result of Mr. Donahue's trading losses, the company
plans to file this week for protection from creditors under
the federal Bankruptcy Code, according to Robert A. Dill, an
attorney for the investment firm.
   Despite Mr. Donahue's absence, Mr. Dill said the firm
hired security guards to keep order during the investors'
meeting. "There obviously were a number of very, very unhappy
people, and in a crowd that size, anything can happen," he
said, adding that Mr. Donahue has received several threats in
recent days.
   The still-unraveling scandal surrounding the secretive
firm has triggered four lawsuits in state courts in Colorado
and California and attracted the attention of Colorado
Securities Commissioner Philip Feigin. However, citing agency
policy, Mr. Feigin declined to comment on whether a formal
investigation is under way. "We're obviously aware of it,"
Mr. Feigin said in an interview.
   Launched as a limited partnership 11 years ago, Hedged
Securities was unregistered with either the Securities and
Exchange Commission or state regulatory agencies. Still, its
promises of a 15% or better return on investments proved
irresistible to pension funds representing employees of
Weyerhaeuser Co., the big lumber company based in Tacoma,
Wash.; Houston-based Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc.; and
other corporations.
   Meanwhile, dozens of wealthy Colorado doctors, lawyers and
business executives also made the $100,000 minimum required
investment despite warnings from professional money managers.
The managers' informal inquiries about Hedged Securities were
frustrated by Mr. Donahue's refusal to discuss details of the
firm's holdings or transactions. "It became the cliquish
thing to do," said Joe Tanis, a vice president with
Denver-based Boettcher &amp; Co. "A lot of people got burned."
   According to a prospectus given to potential investors,
the 62-year-old Mr. Donahue has a masters degree in
mathematics from Stanford University, worked in the research
department of Martin Marietta Corp. in the 1960s and was
employed by Science Applications Inc., a Denver computer
research firm, before launching Hedged Securities in 1979.
Operating with a small staff from the firm's modest office in
the Denver suburb, Mr. Donahue was known as an aggressive
trader in the often volatile arena of "put" and "call" stock
options.
   A call option entitles the holder to buy shares of an
underlying stock at a certain price within a specified period
and would be bought by someone betting on an increase in the
stock's price. A put gives the holder similar rights to sell
such shares and would be purchased by an investor looking for
a downturn in the stock's price.
   In a confidential 1985 memo to investors, Mr. Donahue said
Hedged Securities would seek to hedge its investments by
purchasing offsetting put and call positions in a wide
variety of stocks. But after years of apparently successful
results, investors became suspicious in recent weeks after
Hedged Securities began suffering substantial losses,
according to persons familiar with the situation.
   In a suit filed last week in a state district court in
Englewood, Paradigm Partners Inc. of Chicago said a pension
investment fund it controls lost more than $15 million
through its Hedged Securities investments. Paradigm alleged
that when the fund trustees tried to investigate earlier this
month, Mr. Donahue denied them access to his firm's books and
repeatedly canceled meetings.
   Thursday's session was scheduled after the Weyerhaeuser
pension fund, which lost an estimated $30 million through
Hedged Securities, and other investors began demanding an
accounting, according to persons involved in the case.
   In the videotape played for creditors, Mr. Donahue said
that since late 1989, he had sold off other investments to
spend increasing amounts of money in call positions in the
stock of UAL, parent company of United Airlines and the
target of a buy-out bid by employee unions. Hedged Securities
suffered huge losses after the buy-out bid floundered for
lack of financing and after the price of UAL stock fell
steeply on Iraq's recent invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Donahue told
investors.
   "The loss is extensive and involves almost all of the
total assets of the fund," he said, according to a transcript
of the videotape. "My words at this point cannot possibly
alleviate the emotion{sic} or financial impact on each person
involved nor can they express the deep sorrow I have over
this incident."
   Hedged Securities has about $2 million in assets remaining
and hasn't decided whether to file for a Chapter 11
reorganization or a Chapter 7 liquidation, according to Mr.
Dill. Since Thursday's meeting, Mr. Donahue has begun turning
detailed financial information over to investors, Mr. Dill
added.
