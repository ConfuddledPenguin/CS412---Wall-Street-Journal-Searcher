   TOKYO -- The Japanese government this week is expected to
unveil "concrete measures" to deal with the Middle East
crisis, but some worriers in Japan doubt that Americans will
be satisfied. They expect Americans to grow increasingly
frustrated with Japan for not contributing more to the
U.S.-led multinational effort in the Middle East.
   The measures will seem "too little, too late," fears Hideo
Sato, a professor at Tsukuba University. "This will not help
U.S.-Japan relations."

   Japan's measures are unlikely to include any direct
military contribution, despite Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama's suggestion that Japan consider easing its legal
restrictions on sending forces abroad. The only personnel
Japan seems likely to provide are civilian medical teams.
   The inability to provide much in the way of direct
participation leaves the onus on Japan to subsidize the
international efforts financially. Japanese officials have
already pledged to increase their aid to countries such as
Turkey and Egypt, and there could also be an increase in
"host-nation" support for U.S. forces in Japan.
   But it isn't clear how big the financial contribution will
be. "Everyone in Japan keeps saying Japan's contribution
can't just be money. But it's got to be a hell of a lot of
money as well as something else," says a U.S. official. "I'm
afraid it's not going to be enough. Then they'll catch hell
from us."
   If Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had a stronger voice in
drawing up the measures, there would probably be fewer
worries. Mr. Kaifu owes his current high popularity ratings
in large part to the Japanese public's perception that he has
done well in managing foreign affairs, in particular
relations with Washington. Popularity with the public
protects him from rival LDP Diet members, among whom he has a
weak power base. If a row develops with the U.S. and Mr.
Kaifu's ratings fall, the knives would be out for him.
   But both the Finance Ministry and the Foreign Ministry
will have a lot to say about the outcome, and both
bureaucracies have more reason than the prime minister to be
cautious. Sources say Mr. Kaifu has repeatedly sent them back
to the drawing board, urging them to be more creative. But
it's unclear that he has the power to make them agree to bold
measures.
   Tetsuo Kondo, a ruling-party Diet member, says the Finance
Ministry "is always reluctant" when it comes to spending
money. The Foreign Ministry's bureaucratic reflex is to look
for middle-ground compromises that take into account
competing interests.
   Mr. Kondo, who is close to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
but doesn't claim great influence over his views, is one of
those who wants Japan to do more. "We should be a major
supplier of funds -- a major, major player," he argues.
   Mr. Kondo suggests Japan's role ought to include helping
avoid a world economic downturn. Japan has the world's
strongest economy and is least likely to suffer from higher
oil prices, he argues. Japan should prepare, without foreign
pressure, an economic package to present to the World Bank in
late September, he says.
   Takashi Inoguchi, a Tokyo University professor, wants
Japan to use its economic might to discourage the U.S. from
going to war. If the U.S. slips into recession, Mr. Inoguchi
says, "Maybe then the Japanese government can give incentives
to the U.S. not to intervene militarily."
   Mr. Kondo agrees that Japan's top priority should be to
avoid war, but he wants to do that by helping U.S. forces
stay in the Mideast until sanctions force Iraq to back down.
He suggests that Japan use its ships to send water to U.S.
forces in Saudi Arabia. He would even have Japan build
desalination plants in Saudi Arabia to increase the
fresh-water supply.
   That may sound far-fetched, but Mr. Kondo thinks it makes
more sense than the oft-voiced suggestion that Japan send
minesweepers to the Gulf. "There are no mines to sweep --
it's nonsense. And we have a constitutional problem as well,"
Mr. Kondo says. Besides, he adds, "Our people are much better
at building desalination plants than at sweeping mines."
