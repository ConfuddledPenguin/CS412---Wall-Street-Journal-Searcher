   CHICAGO -- One of the 16 defendants accused of trading
improprieties in the yen pit of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange pleaded guilty to two felony counts in U.S. District
Court here, as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors.
   Aric H. March, the 34-year-old defendant, hasn't been
considered a pivotal figure in the alleged yen-pit scheme.
But his plea-bargain -- in which he agreed to testify on
behalf of the prosecution at the upcoming trial -- is the
first the government has been able to obtain from the yen
traders and brokers facing charges.

   To bolster their case in complex, multidefendant cases,
prosecutors routinely seek to strike such arrangements with
some defendants. The yen trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 4,
and to last for months.
   Mr. March pleaded guilty to charges that in 1986, he
participated in prearranged trades in the Merc's Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 trading pit, including one charge that he
committed mail fraud by allowing a confirmation of one of the
trades to be sent to a customer by U.S. mail. The charges
associated with his yen pit activities were dropped, as part
of the agreement.
   The trader faces a maximum of ten years in prison, and
$500,000 in fines; sentencing will take place after the
yen-pit trial concludes.
   Mr. March's guilty plea to trading violations in the
Merc's S&amp;P pit marks the first formal admission of criminal
wrongdoing by a trader in that Merc operation. Subpoenas were
issued some months ago against 30 to 50 S&amp;P pit traders, and
indictments against an unknown number are expected sometime
in the future.
