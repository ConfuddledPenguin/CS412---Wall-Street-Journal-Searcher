   MOSCOW -- With breathtaking speed, a new federal structure
is starting to emerge in the Soviet Union that bypasses
central authorities in Moscow. And President Mikhail
Gorbachev, after five years of spearheading change, is in
danger of being left behind in the rush.
   Setting the pace is Boris Yeltsin, the newly elected
president of the Russian republic and the man Mr. Gorbachev
fired from the Politburo in late 1987. Over the past few
weeks, Mr. Yeltsin has set a dizzying agenda for himself and
his colleagues, starting talks with the Baltic states,
Azerbaijan and other republics on establishing direct
economic and political ties, and preparing for an overhaul of
Russia's economy that would effectively destroy the present
system of Soviet central planning.

   Underlying Mr. Yeltsin's activism is a declaration of
sovereignty passed by the Russian Parliament in June that
gives the republic sole jurisdiction over its economic
affairs. Almost all the other 14 Soviet republics have
adopted similar declarations, paving the way for a new union
treaty to replace the 1922 treaty that created the U.S.S.R.
   To some extent, Mr. Gorbachev supports these moves. He
wants a new union treaty to be concluded by the end of this
year that would clearly define the functions of constituent
republics and central authorities. A vital part of such a new
treaty, he insists, would be the maintenance of a common
economy, albeit one based more on markets than central
planning. And he wants republics to delegate some of their
sovereign powers to the center, particularly in such areas as
foreign affairs and defense.
   But in the absence of a new treaty, Mr. Yeltsin's Russia
is pushing ahead anyway, taking unilateral economic steps to
enforce its sovereignty. Mr. Gorbachev has been thrown on the
defensive, seeking to block Russian decisions that he feels
contravene national interests.
   The result is a brewing constitutional crisis that all
sides hope to avoid, and growing confusion over lines of
authority that is further undermining international
confidence in the Soviet economy.
   "Gorbachev is dancing on the wire," says Andrei Fyodorov,
a senior Russian government official. "The question is, can
he do so without falling off?"
   After a spat over banking, in which a compromise offering
Russia greater autonomy in monetary matters defused a
confrontation between republican officials and the central
authorities, the latest feud between Russia and the Soviet
government involves control of the republic's vast mineral
wealth. Most of the gold, diamonds, oil and gas in the Soviet
Union are on Russian territory, and republican officials say
they should have a say in how these commodities are used. So
far, however, Moscow has ignored such demands. Officials have
recently plunged ahead with big sales of diamonds and gold to
the West without consulting Russian authorities.
   The Russian Parliament quickly passed a decree stipulating
that it has jurisdiction over minerals mined on its territory
and threatening to block such sales. Last week, Mr. Gorbachev
issued a presidential decree that declared the Russian
decision illegal and promised to honor all foreign contracts.
The Russian Parliament immediately struck back, declaring
this weekend that Mr. Gorbachev's decree itself was invalid.
   Mr. Yeltsin, winding up a three-week tour of Russia,
denounced the Gorbachev move as "a mistake." Speaking on the
Kamchatka peninsula in the Far East, he declared: "I would
advise (Mr. Gorbachev) not to quarrel with Russia, where 150
million people live."
   Such belligerence can partly be ascribed to posturing
prior to negotiations over the new union treaty. Russian
officials say they don't intend to block the diamond sales,
to a Swiss subsidiary of South Africa's De Beers. And so far,
they don't have any of the institutions needed to conclude
such a sale themselves.
   Nonetheless, the message the Russian officials want to
send is unmistakable: Mr. Yeltsin and his colleagues, not Mr.
Gorbachev, are now calling the shots. The Russian government
feels it has greater legitimacy because it was democratically
elected by the people, unlike the Soviet government. "We will
go our own way and nothing will stop us," says Yuri Lebedev,
a senior Russian official who heads the "Innovation Council,"
a think tank recently set up by the Russian leadership that
is supposed to find quick and clever ways around policy
problems.
   Next week, the Russian Parliament will reconvene for its
autumn session, and the agenda is likely to include a dozen
new laws that will lay the groundwork for a market economy in
Russia. They would allow widespread ownership of assets
including land, introduce a rapid privatization program and
end the jurisdiction of most Soviet ministries over the
Russian economy.
   As part of these changes, Mr. Lebedev and several
colleagues on the Innovation Council are planning to travel
to the U.S. this week to negotiate with American computer
companies over possible participation in a project to
establish a Russian computer industry. "A market economy is
impossible without information," Mr. Lebedev says.
   The Russian economic plans are far more radical than a
package of measures being worked out by Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov, who is also planning to unveil his proposals
in early September. To avert the very real threat of turmoil,
Mr. Gorbachev has agreed to cooperate with Mr. Yeltsin in an
attempt to coordinate the economic-reform plans. Top
economists from both sides are currently holed up in a
Russian government dacha outside Moscow called Little Pine
Trees, trying to thrash out a consensus.
   Prime Minister Ryzhkov and the state central planning
authorities are likely to be the losers. Some Russian
officials have already called for the resignation of Mr.
Ryzhkov, whose attempts at introducing reforms earlier this
year were rejected as inadequate.
   But Mr. Yeltsin insists he is still seeking to work with
Mr. Gorbachev for the good of the nation. The two leaders are
expected to meet to discuss their many differences in the
near future, perhaps as early as tomorrow. "It is not a
process of confrontation, but growing closeness between the
leaders of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation," he
said last week. "Serious steps to meet each other halfway
have been taken."
   Given Russia's enormous economic and political clout, few
officials doubt that Russia will play the leading role in
writing a new union treaty. For them, it is a question of
whether Mr. Gorbachev cooperates with Mr. Yeltsin, rather
than the other way around. Says Mr. Fyodorov, the Russian
government official: "The balance of forces has changed."
