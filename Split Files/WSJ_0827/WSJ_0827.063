   ARLINGTON, Va. -- USAir Group Inc. said it would dismiss
by year end another 2,100 employees, many of them managers,
in the deepest cut yet of its payroll and one of the largest
layoffs by an airline in years.
   The action brings to 3,600 people the number of employees
that USAir has fired or furloughed in recent days. The
airline holding company blamed the layoffs, which affect 7%
of its 54,000 employees, on "softening of passenger demand,
poor economic conditions, escalating fuel costs and the
company's need to reduce operating expenses."

   The cuts also amount to a mid-course correction of
ambitious expansion plans at USAir. USAir said it slashed its
1991 projected capacity growth rate to a maximum of 2% from
6%.
   The layoffs at the nation's No. 6 air carrier are much
deeper than Wall Street analysts expected and are sure to
send a chill through the airline industry. Most of the
industry's massive personnel cuts in recent years have come
at financially troubled carriers such as Continental Airlines
and Eastern Airlines, both units of Continental Airlines
Holding Inc. But USAir has traditionally been one of the
country's most profitable carriers.
   To be sure, USAir has been posting losses since it
completed its merger with Piedmont Aviation Inc. last August.
In the first half of 1990, USAir has piled up net losses of
$113 million.
   "The cushion is gone, and they're facing a difficult,
uncertain future," said Edmund Greenslet, an airline
consultant at ESG Aviation Services. "They can't sit around
and wait."
   Already, other airlines have been hunkering down in
expectation of waning demand resulting from a recession.
Midway Airlines, a small Chicago-based carrier, started
laying off some employees in May. AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall has issued an edict to cut
costs in his company.
   The USAir retrenchment, including Friday's move, affects
500 managers, 211 pilots, 650 flight attendants and 2,100
reservations, customer service and fleet service agents. Some
other employees would also be affected.
   USAir didn't say how much it expected to save as a result
of the layoffs. But it has been clear for some time that the
company had fat to trim from its operating expenses. USAir's
labor costs have been among the highest in an industry where
payroll is the biggest expense. Its merger with Piedmont
increased those costs.
   USAir indicated that the layoffs might be expensive in the
short run. It said it is "reviewing" early retirement and
voluntary separation programs, which typically involve
one-time payments to employees as compensation for leaving
their jobs.
   USAir announced the latest move after the close of trading
Friday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
USAir stock closed at $14.375 a share, up 12.5 cents.
