   RICHMOND, Va. -- James River Corp. said four executives
were given broader responsibilities as part of an effort to
simplify the paper-products company's business structure and
boost its resources for expansion.
   Charles E. Eberle, who had directed the company's U.S.
towel and tissue operations, was named executive vice
president in charge of all consumer-product businesses. The
new grouping accounts for about 50% of James River's domestic
sales.

business.
