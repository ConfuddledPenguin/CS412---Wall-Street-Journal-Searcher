   Central bankers must forever warn their countrymen that
what feels good today may prove painful tomorrow. It is a
very unpopular task. And because it is so unpopular, it has
always been especially difficult in democracies.
   That's doubly true for the world's newest democracies --
the nations of Eastern Europe. The central banks of these
nations stand at the center of a wrenching effort to convert
socialist economies into capitalist ones. Their actions will
determine whether that effort is a success, or whether it
leads the Eastern European nations down the hyperinflationary
path traveled by so many Latin American nations.

   For most of Eastern Europe, inflation has not been a
problem. Prices are set by the government and, therefore, are
easy to keep under control. The average inflation rate in
Czechoslovakia and Romania over the past five years has been
less than 1%. In Bulgaria, it has been barely 2%. The only
horror story in the region has been Poland, which has seen
the rate of consumer price inflation soar to 270% a year in
1989 from 15% a year in 1985.
                                                                                                       

   But the official inflation numbers bely a more serious
problem. In each of these countries, the state banks for
years have been printing money to subsidize hugely
inefficient state-owned enterprises. The result is a classic
inflationary prescription -- too much money chasing too few
goods. Once prices are decontrolled, the central banks will
have to keep a tight rein on credit to prevent inflation from
galloping out of sight. And the crushing economic damage
caused by tight credit will be substantial. Poland, the
nation racing most rapidly toward economic reform, already
has seen the incomes of its people drop 30% this year as a
result of its anti-inflation policies.
   Eager for help in dealing with this dilemma, central
bankers from Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania and the Soviet Union traveled to the Grand
Teton National Park over the weekend to consult with the best
of the Western world's central bankers. They heard ample
advice. Some told them their policies should be geared toward
restricting domestic credit expansion. Others said they
should peg their exchange rates to another currency. A few
even recommended gold as an anchor.
                                                                                                       

   Whenever a consensus seemed about to emerge, someone else
took the floor to dispute it. "You are getting
well-intentioned but bad advice from your colleagues,"
Carnegie Mellon economist Allan Meltzer told the Easterners
at one point. "I don't see how we can give advice overseas if
we are so unsure of it ourselves," said Bear Stearns
economist Lawrence Kudlow at another.
                                                                                                       

   The Westerners were unanimous in advising their Eastern
counterparts to make the central banks as independent as
possible of their respective governments. That's a common
concern of central bankers; they feel a universal need to
insulate themselves from democratic governments, fearing
public pressure will stop them from carrying out their
unpleasant tasks.
   On this point, many of the Eastern Europeans seem to
already have taken heed. Wladyslaw Baka, president of the
National Bank of Poland, said his institution already enjoys
independence from the government, with Parliament arbitrating
any differences between the two. And Imre Tarafas, first
deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary, said his
institution is drafting a law that will provide for a largely
independent central bank, with governors appointed to fixed
terms, as in the United States.
   But as Western countries have discovered, independence
goes only so far. The Federal Reserve has certainly had to
bend at times to pressure from the White House and Congress.
And even the famed independence of the German Bundesbank
collapsed recently in the face of immense popular support for
a plan to unify the East and West German economies on terms
the central bank thought unwise.
   Thus, public support is still critical. And a compelling
description of the difficulties the economic reformers in
Eastern Europe face in maintaining public support was given
here by Vaclav Klaus, the charismatic finance minister of
Czechoslovakia who is preparing a free-market reform plan
nearly as radical as Poland's. Mr. Klaus said in his country
the battle for public opinion carries down to the man in the
streets, with reformers advocating politically unpopular
"restrictive" policies to fight inflation, and anti-reformers
calling for expansionary policies. "The debate between
restrictive and expansionary policies is a public debate
going on in Czechoslovakia every day," he said.
                                                                                                       

   The Middle East crisis multiplies the reformers' problems.
Higher oil prices will hit the oil-dependent Eastern European
nations just as they are weaning themselves from Soviet oil.
"For us, it comes at the worst possible time," said Mr.
Klaus. "We will be blamed for what is going on in the Middle
East."
                                                                                                       

   Already, economic reformers such as Mr. Klaus are under
heavy attack. One joke circulating Prague, he says, goes as
follows: Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel comes across
an old man eating grass in the city park. "Since the
elimination of subsidies, I've had no food to eat," the man
complains. "Here's 100 crowns; go eat," Mr. Havel responds.
The next day Finance Minister Klaus comes across another old
man eating grass, who also complains of subsidy cuts. "Here's
one crown," Mr. Klaus responds, "take the tram to the edge of
the city; the grass is much greener there."
   The reformers will have to find a way to keep public
support on their side if their bold economic experiments are
to succeed. In the end, no amount of technical expertise or
institutional refinement from the West can replace that.
