   NEW YORK -- The amount of high-grade corporate debt has
dwindled to the point that what's left appears way
overpriced. But that hasn't stopped money managers from
buying what's out there.
   Investors who own top-quality bonds issued by industrial
corporations "are holding all the cards right now," said
William Mast, a bond strategist at Shearson Lehman. "We spend
a lot of time looking for bonds we want to buy, but there are
not many sellers."

   That's in part because top-quality corporate bonds are
scarce. Consider the shrinking size of the elite Triple-A
club of industrial corporations. Credit analysts said the
group had more than 30 members a decade ago compared with
between 13 and 15 today. (Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. counts 15
and Moody's Investors Service Inc. counts 13.)
   If you expand the group to include double-A-rated
companies, which still have very good ratings, the list would
have about 50 members, down from well over 100 a decade ago.
   The reason for the shrinkage is no surprise: The leveraged
buy-outs of the 1980s, which loaded companies with debt and
reduced their credit-worthiness while mergers and
acquisitions brought about a consolidation in corporate
America.
   What is a surprise is that the corporate market appears to
be behaving better than most other sectors of the bond market
-- an unusual development considering corporate debt often is
more sensitive to changes in the economy.
   After all, talk of recession and fears of inflation are
trends that in the past have caused investors to seek safety
by investing in short-term Treasury notes and bills while
bailing out of corporate bonds. That's because investors
worry that lean economic times translate into poor corporate
credit quality and high default rates.
   Although such concerns certainly have shaken the stock
market, the high-grade corporate bond market has held firm.
The reason, say analysts, is that fixed-income money managers
are under pressure to find ways to raise the total return of
their portfolios without taking on too much risk. Because
bond prices have been essentially flat or lower this year,
the only way portfolio managers can eke out a positive return
is to offset the depreciating prices with higher yields. One
solution, of course, is a high-grade corporate bond.
   "The amount of cash looking for incremental yield is
enormous and is growing," said Jon Winklereid, a vice
president in the new issues department at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. At the same time, high-grade companies just aren't
issuing as much debt as they have in the past. The result,
said Mr. Winklereid, is "a fair amount of money chasing not
that many securities," which is keeping the corporate bond
market relatively strong.
   The scarcity factor has made it possible for prices of
corporate bonds to fall more slowly than prices of comparable
Treasury securities. Although some analysts believe this
trend won't last much longer, for now corporate bonds are
considered expensive.
   It's not that corporate bond prices haven't eroded along
with the rest of the bond market. It's just that the yields
on the bonds relative to Treasury bonds have remained
unchanged, or in some cases have narrowed. The exception is
financial-company bonds, especially those issued by banks,
where the yield gap has widened considerably against Treasury
bonds.
   To appraise the relative value of corporate bonds,
analysts most often watch the "yield spread," which compares
yields on a given security with those of a U.S. Treasury
security having a similar maturity. Because U.S. government
notes and bonds are considered the safest securities of all,
other taxable fixed-income securities are priced at yields
that are higher than Treasurys to reflect their higher credit
risk.
   When yields on corporate bonds move closer to yields on
Treasury bonds, they are considered expensive relative to
Treasurys and when they move further away they are said to be
cheap.
   The yields on several new top-quality issues have narrowed
the fastest. Dayton Hudson Corp., for example, issued $200
million of 12-year notes on June 26 priced at par to yield
9.75%, 1.25 percentage points higher than the yield on
10-year Treasury notes. On Friday, the bonds were yielding
10.13%, or a narrower 1.1% percentage points above Treasurys.
   Another recent issuer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sold $500
million of 10-year notes July 16 priced at par to yield
9.10%, for a spread that was 0.65 percentage point higher
than the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. On Friday, the
spread was only 0.53 percentage point.
   Mr. Winklereid at Goldman Sachs is among a small number of
analysts who aren't convinced that corporate bonds are
expensive. Instead, he says, they are priced correctly
considering they are in short supply. And with yields now
between 9% and 10%, he says this is "a buying opportunity"
for investors.
   But not everyone would agree. "If oil prices continue to
rise and the economy remains under pressure, prices of
corporate bonds have to fall relative to Treasurys," said
David Glenn, a portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark,
which manages mutual funds.
   Wayne Wong, a portfolio manager at Marinvest, a subsidiary
of Marine Midland Bank, said fear that the spreads will widen
soon has kept him away from new corporate bonds. For extra
yield, he has been buying mortgage-backed securities instead.
   "If I have to reach for yield, I'd rather be in securities
that are backed by a government agency," which are sometimes
considered nearly as solid as Treasurys, said Mr. Wong. Many
mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by mortgages
that are guaranteed by agencies such as the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. and the Federal National Mortgage Association.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices continued to decend as the possibility of war
between the U.S. and Iraq escalated.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds ended at 95 26/32,
down nearly 1/4 point from 96 1/32 on Thursday. That
translates into a loss of about $2.50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, rose to 9.15% from 9.13%
Thursday.
   For the entire week, the price of the benchmark 30-year
bond slipped 2 5/32 points and the yield jumped more than 1/5
percentage point.
   Early in the day on Friday, Treasurys found support in
lower oil prices and moved slightly higher. After reaching
levels not seen in five years earlier in the week, October
crude oil futures ended the week at $30.91 a barrel, down
$1.02 from Thursday.
   But a midday White House announcement that Iraqi forces
had surrounded the U.S. embassy in Kuwait and were preventing
people from entering and leaving the embassy compound knocked
Treasurys off their highs.
   Meanwhile, traders and investors worried about this week's
government bond auctions. In addition to the regular Treasury
bill auction today, the government is scheduled to sell $11.5
billion of two-year notes Tuesday and $8.5 billion of
five-year notes Wednesday. In when-issued trading activity,
the two-year notes were quoted at a price to yield 8.27%
while the five-year notes were quoted to yield 8.69%.
   In the corporate bond market, a late-afternoon rally in
the stock market sparked a flurry of buying interest for junk
bonds, but even that wasn't enough to inspire much trading.
   Most high-yield bonds, which had tumbled all week in
tandem with sharp declines in the stock market, ended the
session little changed in light dealings.
   The pay-in-kind debentures of RJR Nabisco Inc., which had
been battered in the recent sell-off, managed to creep higher
Friday. The company's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind
debentures finished 5/8 point higher to close at 106 7/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The gains, however, only
represent a fraction of the losses the bonds have suffered in
the past week. Since last Friday, the convertible pay-in-kind
debentures have shed nearly five points.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds posted losses, with some long-term issues
falling as much as 7/8 point.
