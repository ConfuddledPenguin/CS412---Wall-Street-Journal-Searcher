   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., continuing an
internal restructuring, took several steps to beef up its big
brokerage division and make it a stand-alone organization.
   Jonathan Linen, the new brokerage-division chief brought
in by parent American Express Co. in May, said the division
for the first time will have its own chief administrative
officer, chief financial officer and personnel director. The
idea is to make the brokerage division "a single, integrated
business," Mr. Linen told employees in a letter Friday.

   Shearson, the second-biggest U.S. brokerage firm behind
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., is trying to revive itself after posting
a record loss of $915 million in the first quarter to pay for
a big retrenchment plan. American Express has made the firm a
wholly owned unit and has been trying to reshape it in
American Express's image.
   Mr. Linen -- whose brokerage division has been split off
from Shearson's other half, the Lehman Brothers
capital-markets division -- gave new titles to three top
executives:
   -- Joseph Plumeri, 47 years old, was named president of
the Private Client Group for individual-investor businesses,
a post left vacant since Hardwick Simmons resigned at the
time of Mr. Linen's appointment. Mr. Plumeri remains head of
the 450-branch U.S. brokerage network but now will be
responsible for national sales. Shearson said he'll also form
a new unit, named Quality, to improve client relations.
   -- Jerome Miller, 50, was named president of the Asset
Management Group that also includes unit trusts and mutual
funds, businesses he was already running.
   -- Henry Gottmann, 52, who had been in charge of national
sales and marketing, fills the new post of chief
administrative officer for the brokerage division. While Mr.
Plumeri is assuming Mr. Gottmann's former sales
responsibilities, Shearson says it plans to hire a new
marketing director.
   Also to be filled are two other senior-level positions:
"human resources" director and chief financial officer.
   Mr. Linen also said he formed a new executive committee to
set policy in the division. The committee includes himself,
Messrs. Plumeri, Miller and Gottmann and eventually the new
marketing, personnel and financial heads.
   American Express has repeatedly denied the suggestion that
it is preparing Shearson, or a part of it, for a sale. Making
the brokerage division stand on its own is only part of an
effort to "decentralize" Shearson in the style of American
Express, Mr. Linen said.
