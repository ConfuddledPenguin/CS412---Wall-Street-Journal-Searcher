   OTTAWA -- A U.S.-Canada trade panel asked the U.S.
International Trade Commission to reconsider its earlier
ruling which found that subsidized Canadian pork exports to
the U.S. threatened to injure U.S. pig producers.
   The panel said the ITC's finding relied heavily on
"questionable" statistics of increased Canadian pork
production.

   The ITC ruled last year that subsidized exports of
Canadian fresh, chilled and frozen pork threatened to injure
U.S. pig producers and meat packers. As a result of the
ruling, the U.S. put in place countervailing duties of 3.6
Canadian cents per pound of processed pork.
   The U.S.-Canada panel said the appearance of a big
increase in Canadian pork production in 1988 was caused by a
change in the method of counting and reporting pork
production by the Canadian government. It said that Canadian
pork production grew 8.4% in 1988 from 1986 and not 31% as
thought by the ITC. The panel noted that the 8.4% increase
was less than U.S. production growth in the same period.
   Martin Rice, executive secretary of the Canadian Pork
Council, said pork exports to the U.S. are expected to
decline this year to about $300 million Canadian dollars
(US$265.8 million) from about C$400 million in 1989 because
of falling production. Canadian pork exports currently make
up less than 3% of the U.S. market.
   Mr. Rice said he was "encouraged" by the panel's decision
because, he said, it could lead to the removal of
countervailing duties on Canadian pork exports and boost
Canadian production.
   The panel instructed the ITC to reconsider the impact of
Canadian subsidies on U.S. pork production taking the smaller
production statistics into consideration. The ITC has 60 days
to respond to the panel's ruling.
   The trade panel was established under the dispute
settlement provisions of the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement
which went into effect Jan. 1, 1989. The panel included three
Canadian and two U.S. members.
   The U.S. government investigation of Canadian pork exports
originated from complaints filed by the U.S. National Pork
Producers Council which had argued that Canadian packers
benefited from Canadian government subsidies to hog farmers.
   The governments of Canada, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and
several Canadian industry groups have requested a separate
U.S.-Canada panel to review the method used by the U.S. to
determine the level of subsidy to hog farmers.
   The Canadian government also has requested a review of the
subsidy issue by a panel of the General Agreement on Tarrifs
and Trade, a Geneva organization that regulates trade between
most non-socialist countries. According to news reports, the
GATT panel has found that the U.S. violated GATT rules in
imposing countervailing duties on imports of processed pork
to offset government subsidies to pig farmers.
   A meeting of the full GATT council is expected to be held
Oct. 3 where it will decide to accept or reject the panel's
decision.
