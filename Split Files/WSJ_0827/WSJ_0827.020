   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on about $3
billion of debt issued by McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s finance
unit.
   The rating concern cited the finance unit's problem
real-estate and auto loans in addition to the parent
company's "weaker credit-worthiness" and the negative outlook
for its aerospace business.

   S&amp;P reduced McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp.'s senior debt
to single-A-minus from single-A-plus, subordinated debt to
triple-B-plus from single-A and commercial paper to A-2 from
A-1. S&amp;P removed the issues from its Credit-Watch list, where
it had placed the term debt June 11 and the commercial paper
July 27.
   A spokesman for the St. Louis-based parent company said
the finance unit had increased its provisions for loan
losses. But the unit "isn't in a net-loss position and has
been very profitable for some time."
   S&amp;P said that although it has traditionally rated the
finance unit's debt separately, "the negative outlook for the
parent's business represents a potential drag on the
credit-worthiness of the subsidiary."
   As previously reported, S&amp;P reduced McDonnell Douglas's
senior debt rating July 27 to triple-B-plus from
single-A-minus and subordinated debt to triple-B from
triple-B-plus and removed those issues from its Credit-Watch
list. The company's single-A commercial paper rating was
placed on Credit-Watch.
