   WASHINGTON -- When the Pentagon called up the reserves, it
bought them some new clothes, too. If the reservists are
lucky, they will never have to wear them.
   The Defense Logistics Agency said on Friday that it
ordered 450,000 chemical-warfare suits from two privately
held clothing makers. Gibralter, Puerto Rico Inc., based in
San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, won a $19.3 million award to make
250,000 of the outfits; Sidran Inc. in Dallas got a $15.5
million award for 200,000.

   For the Pentagon, this was a rapid-deployment procurement.
Seth Maxwell, Gibralter's senior vice president, said the
logistics agency put out the bid, made a decision and awarded
the contract in about six days. The last time the U.S. bought
chemical warfare garb -- 1.8 million suits in March 1989 --
it took the government a year to award the contracts.
   The Pentagon's haste was evident in their choice of color
-- woodland green, instead of desert brown. "It would have
taken a while to get the fabric" in the desert colors, Mr.
Maxwell said.
   The two companies are supplying chemical warfare coats and
pants at a cost of about $77 an outfit. (A full chemical
warfare outfit includes a gas mask and boot coverings, too.)
   "That's not so expensive" compared to ordinary trousers
and coats, says Mr. Maxwell, "and they're considerably more
useful."
   Each outfit is made of a cotton-nylon fabric lined with
activated charcoal, which can protect a soldier for four
hours from microbes that kill, he says. After that, the
soldier must change clothes because the charcoal gets
saturated. Clothing industry talk suggests the Pentagon
figures it needs four uniforms for each soldier, but the
Defense Department won't say.
   Making the uniforms is messy work. Sewing-machine
operators get covered with soot from the charcoal, Mr.
Maxwell says, and often quit. Even so, he promises to start
churning out about 25,000 suits a month by about
Thanksgiving.
