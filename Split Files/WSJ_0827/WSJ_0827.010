   BANGKOK, Thailand -- Almost two years after a military
junta took power and began touting a new open-door policy,
the Burmese economy is floundering.
   Output has yet to return to the already sinking levels of
late 1987, when the United Nations declared Burma to be among
the world's least-developed nations. Economists estimate the
annual inflation rate is about 70%, and some predict it will
reach triple digits this year.

   All this has occurred despite some fundamental changes in
Burma's business climate. For the first time in nearly 30
years, foreign investment is permitted, and several large
foreign companies -- including 10 oil companies -- and many
smaller ones have set up shop. After decades of prohibition,
the Burmese private sector has been allowed to engage in
foreign trade. More than 1,000 Burmese exporters, and about
350 importers, have registered since liberalizations were
announced in November 1988.
   The regime has legalized a booming border trade with China
and allowed border dealings with Thailand, Bangladesh and
Laos. It has permitted the private sector to engage in
activities formerly monopolized by the state. It also has
given more Burmese access to foreign currencies.
   But open-door policy and other changes haven't much helped
the average Burmese, nor have they lessened the country's
macroeconomic plight. The military regime has yet to tackle
such fundamental problems as the country's unrealistic
exchange rate, resource-draining state enterprises, and an
inept bureaucracy.
   Political uncertainty also is sapping business confidence.
Though the National League for Democracy won a landslide
majority in May's election, the military is unlikely to cede
power in the near term.
   Burma's military rulers "have a verbal commitment to
reform, but they don't have the slightest comprehension of
what economic reform would actually entail," says a Western
diplomat. "There's a complete absence of the realization that
if you want Burmese to invest in Burma, then you have to
reduce the entrepreneur's fear of the arbitrary power of the
state."
   Arbitrary state action has been at the heart of Burma's
economic decline for years. For example, the currency has
thrice been declared worthless. Even now the government seems
ambivalent: While the state-run press heralds each foreign
investment as a triumph of the open-door policy, it denounces
foreigners as neo-colonists and warns Burmese not to trust
outsiders.
   "They say they want foreign investment, but the number of
hoops any investor has to go through is just as many as it
was before," says a foreign economist specializing in Burma.
   Some analysts cite the country's new tourism law, unveiled
in June, as indicative of the regime's fundamental mistrust
of business and foreigners. Tourism is a potentially
promising industry for Burma, yet in the new law, the first
priority specified is "prevention of infringement of the
sovereignty and security of the state." The last priority is
"providing security and satisfaction of tourists."
   A commercial tax law announced in March is even more
flawed, some analysts say. Probably introduced to widen
Burma's tax base, the law appears to function somewhat like a
value-added tax. But unlike VATs, where only the value-added
component is taxed at each stage of production of a good, the
law apparently taxes the entire value of the product at each
step. Because of its pyramiding effect, the tax is likely to
discourage desperately needed manufacturing and processing
industries, analysts say, and promote imports, which are
taxed only once.
   Burma's exchange-rate policy is among the thorniest
problems for foreigners and Burmese alike. The official
exchange rate is about 5.6 kyat to the dollar, or more than
10 times its current black-market value. Because foreign
companies are required to convert funds at the official rate,
business in Burma is expensive.
   A longer-term problem is Burma's rotting infrastructure.
The country's manufacturing base has been debilitated by
chronic shortages of foreign exchange, which meant that vital
parts and raw materials couldn't be bought. The country has
vast oil reserves, but decades of self-imposed isolation
blocked industry access to modern technology and equipment to
improve yields from older oil fields. Recently concluded
joint-venture exploration contracts won't add to output for
several years. The distribution of electricity is "abysmal,"
and the country's telecommunications network -- including
only 26 international circuits -- is woefully inadequate, a
diplomat says.
   Burma's basic infrastructure problems probably won't be
solved without substantial foreign aid. However, the
country's main donors -- including Japan, West Germany,
Britain and the U.S. -- have suspended aid, pending transfer
of power to a democratically elected government.
   Burma's sizable debt also hampers its ability to secure
development financing. In March, Burma repaid 3.5 billion yen
($23.3 million) of the 23 billion yen it owes Japan, the
first debt repayment it has made in several years. Diplomats
and economists don't expect further repayments soon on
Burma's more than $5 billion of debt.
   Despite obvious obstacles, several foreign companies are
doing business in Burma. Aside from the 10 oil companies,
other foreign concerns are exploring for zinc and other
minerals. Korea's Daewoo Group, which started with a
shirt-making factory outside Rangoon in 1987, recently
unveiled plans to produce television sets, radio-cassette
recorders and refrigerators, and to set up a third garment
factory.
   Daewoo, Toshiba Corp.'s Singapore subsidiary and other
foreign companies have opened retail outlets in Rangoon,
selling consumer goods priced in foreign currencies.
   Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Nestle S.A. and other food
companies are contemplating investments, and several tourism
companies have concluded deals to build hotels and operate
chartered tourist flights.
