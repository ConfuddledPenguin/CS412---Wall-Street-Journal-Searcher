   Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. said its merger with Quidel
Corp. has been put on hold because an investor who was
considering putting $7 million into the transaction has
gotten cold feet.
   Monoclonal Antibodies was to merge with Quidel by swapping
a total of 9.7 million Monoclonal shares for all Quidel
shares outstanding. At current prices, the transaction is
valued at about $30.3 million.

   In the over-the-counter market Friday, Monoclonal was
quoted at $3.125 bid, down 50 cents. At the time of the
initial announcement, the companies said they were
negotiating with David Blech, a private investor, for a $7
million equity infusion into Quidel before the merger was
completed. Monoclonal said Mr. Blech has decided not to do
that. He couldn't be reached to comment.
   Monoclonal, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes diagnostic
test kits, primarily for fertility tests. Quidel, based in
San Diego, also makes diagnostic kits.
