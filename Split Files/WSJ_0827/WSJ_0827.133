   ASK Corp. of Waco, Texas, said it entered into a letter of
understanding with the Sheet Metal Workers' National Pension
Fund, regarding the previously announced plan of the fund and
another institution to infuse $20 million of debt and equity
into the maker of natural gas heating and airconditioning
systems.
   ASK said the letter sets out the main elements of a
proposed definitive agreement, and establishes projected time
frames for completion of due diligience and closing of the
transaction, subject to approval by the boards of the three
parties involved.
