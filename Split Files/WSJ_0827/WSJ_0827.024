   "We just make the best out of life," says a character in
"Motel," the new "P.O.V." offering airing tomorrow night on
PBS (10 p.m. Check local listings). That may not sound like
much of a dramatic premise but it is in fact a sterling one,
in the right hands. The stories of lives lived on the edge in
this film by Christian Blackwood are in fact the stuff of
genuine drama, largely because they are about the effort to
hold on to the norms of life while living at the fringes.
   The first segment, about three middle-aged divorcees who
run the Silver Saddle Motel in Santa Fe, may seem like slow
going compared with the rest of the program, but that
slowness also succeeds in establishing the tone of these
lives. You will instantly recognize these brassily confident
businesswomen, clearly pleased at where they find themselves
(running a motel), after decades spent on husbands and
similarly useless investments.

   Just what motels mean in American life is something Mr.
Blackwell has obviously pondered deeply. Somewhere in one of
the publicity handouts, he opines that motels are a very
American story because they represent the constant state of
impermanence and transition in America. This cliche about the
impermanence of American life is, of course, an idee fixe
among European film makers (Mr. Blackwood hails from
Germany), for whom it serves as an all-purpose explanation
for all social phenomena. Fortunately, there is no trace of
any such fatuousness in the film itself, which focuses
chastely on its subjects with little intrusiveness.
   The really riveting characters begin to appear in the
second sequence, which concerns three women who married men
in prison -- men in for hauls as long as 25 years to life for
murder. Every few weeks the women arrive at the Blue Mist
Motel, close by the Arizona State Prison, and begin to primp
for their visits.
   One of these is Helen, apparently in her 60s, who met and
married a good-looking prisoner half her age after becoming
his pen pal. Helen pokes at her hair and applies makeup with
ferocious concentration as she explains with considerable
poise that all this is in obedience to requests from her man.
For instance, he wants her hair worn long. So be it, though
long hair looks silly on an older woman, Helen cheerily
notes, plumping her tresses.
   Elsewhere on the premises, Sandra, another wife, is
primping for the visit to her spouse, incarcerated for
involvement in a drug murder. A former guard who met her
husband while working at the prison, Sandra's relation to her
husband's social circle is more delicate than that of most
wives. As she explains, "A lot of convicts will never accept
me because I'm a cop." A problem indeed.
   Nancy, the third wife, who married her husband after he
was jailed for credit-card fraud, reports that he is a
wonderful person who happens unfortunately to be in prison.
Nancy also explains that once you get used to hanging around
a prison, it doesn't seem so strange. We learn that conjugal
and other visits used to be allowed at the motel but are no
longer, ever since a prisoner chopped his adoptive mother's
body up into small pieces there.
   Still, for all their lack of physical intimacy, for all
the joshing talk about plans to scale the prison walls to be
with their men, these wives, its clear, have found their
version of perfect love. "This is the only thing that has
ever worked for me," says blond Nancy, married to the
credit-card thief. Of her limited relation to this wonderful
person in her life, Nancy says, it causes her to appreciate
every little moment all the more. The other wives fervently
agree, declaring themselves in love as never before, and that
no relationship in their lives has ever succeeded the way
their marriages to these husbands have.
   Theirs are not the first cases to suggest that the secret
of undying love is to have little or no contact with the
beloved. If for no other reason, "Motel" would be worth
watching for its cold-eyed elicitation of such testimony.
   There are, as it happens, plenty of other reasons, mainly
having to do with the last 30 minutes. Here we encounter an
aging, still beautiful ballerina of phenomenal ambition. Her
performance career over, dancer Marta Becket some years back
saw her future in an ancient hotel and opera house in the
ghost town of Death Valley Junction. A talented painter as
well as a dancer, she transformed the old opera house walls,
covering them with murals showing hordes of faces watching
the stage.
   Ms. Becket explains that these were at first her sole
audience for the productions she and her husband mounted for
an empty house in a ghost town. Be warned that some aspects
of this segment are confusing, as the camera shows her
dancing to wild applause in that empty house, which suggests
that applause is her fantasy. In fact, Ms. Becket succeeded
in making a name for herself locally, and draws crowds to the
Amargosa Opera House, as it is called. She also managed to
get rid of her ne'er-do-well husband, replacing him with the
town's one other resident and, along the way, falling in love
with him.
   All of this could easily have gone awry, as portraits of
eccentrics, even highly talented eccentrics, have a way of
doing, in part because eccentricity is a barrier to emotional
connection. But in this profoundly eccentric life, "Motel"
has found the fire and the passions that render her wholly
recognizable. The ballerina looks to be a woman of
indeterminate decade, hovering somewhere between 55 and 65.
In one lyrical sequence she dances through the rooms of the
deserted hotel and it is, while elegiac, a performance
untouched by sadness or self-pity.
   If you want self-pity, you have to wait till the ballerina
talks, which she does at some length, and with style. The
self-pity oddly enhances Marta's recital of her various life
burdens. These included, first and foremost, a mother who
thought only of success. A woman in her fifth or sixth decade
who can still carry on in public about her mother, without
losing dignity, is not to be underestimated. This affecting
portrait of the ballerina is likely to stay with you a while.
   "Motel" is presented under the auspices of "P.O.V."
("Point of View"), which specializes heavily in politicized
programs designed for our moral betterment. This entirely
nonpolitical offering is by far the best "P.O.V." segment in
some time. There may be a lesson in there somewhere.
