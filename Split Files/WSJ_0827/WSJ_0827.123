   CALGARY -- The sharp jump in crude oil prices could boost
Sceptre Resources Ltd.'s 1990 cash flow by about 15 million
Canadian dollars (US$13.3 million) and earnings by C$10
million, said Richard Gusella, the company's president and
chief executive officer.
   Gusella said the figures assume an average price for West
Texas Intermediate crude of about US$25 a barrel for the rest
of 1990, or $5 above Sceptre's previous expected price. At
US$30 a barrel, Sceptre's cash flow would jump C$30 million
and earnings would rise C$20 million this year, he said.

   After a disappointing first half, Gusella said that
Sceptre in July scaled down its expectations for the current
year, only to see its revised numbers completely changed by
the oil price spiral that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
"Our old assumptions are all wrong now," he said in an
interview, although Sceptre may "coincidentally" now reach
its initial cash flow estimate for 1990 of about C$90
million.
   That would represent a sharp gain over Sceptre's 1989 cash
flow of C$59 million or 85 cents a share. On the earnings
side, Gusella said Sceptre expected a break-even year for
1990, and a small loss on a per-share basis, before the
recent jump in crude prices.
   In 1989, Sceptre reported a net loss of C$24.2 million or
40 cents, after a C$19 million write-down of foreign assets,
on revenue of C$198.3 million.
   Gusella said the company continues to whittle down debt
from its 1989 acquisition of cash-strapped Oakwood Petroleums
Ltd., and sees bank debt shrinking to C$196 million by year
end, down from C$305.9 million at the end of 1989.
