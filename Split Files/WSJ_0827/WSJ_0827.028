   VIENNA -- OPEC's oil ministers began politically charged
talks on higher output quotas to help hold down petroleum
prices during the Middle East crisis.
   As more ministers than had been expected arrived here over
the weekend, a consensus seemed to build that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might turn what
had been billed as a series of informal talks into a
full-blown meeting. Such a formal meeting could officially
act on proposals by some countries that they be allowed to
produce more oil to replace embargoed Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.

   A previous request by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for such
an extraordinary conference, or emergency meeting, failed to
receive majority approval and was rejected by Sadek Boussena,
Algeria's oil minister and OPEC's president.
   Even Mr. Boussena, who has insisted that the consuming
nations should draw down their high oil inventories before
asking OPEC to produce more, showed some signs of flexibility
on the issue that has sharply divided the organization. "The
only thing we have in mind is to save OPEC," he said on his
arrival.
   Of OPEC's 13 member nations, 11 were represented here by
last night. The only absentees were the ministers from Iraq
and Libya. Libya's minister is still expected.
   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates are
thought to be capable of making up three million barrels a
day of the four million barrels taken out of world oil
markets by the embargo. The three countries would like to get
a meeting to officially approve output beyond their current
quotas, though it has been clear they intend to increase
production, anyway, if OPEC's clearance isn't forthcoming
soon.
   Iraq strongly opposes such a move by OPEC, and has been
supported by several other members who argue that OPEC's late
July production agreement shouldn't be altered until there is
real evidence of tight supplies. Some worry that changing
that agreement would appear to be bowing to U.S. wishes to
hold down petroleum prices while the U.S. leads global
sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Friday, oil prices eased but remained above the
$30-a-barrel mark. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
crude, fell $1.05 to $30.90, while in the international
market, North Sea Brent dropped $1.20 to $31.20.
   Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, renewed the
call for an emergency session on his arrival. "We need to
take some action {now}," said Mr. Armas, adding: "The world
is waiting for OPEC."
   Venezuela already is pumping more than its quota of 1.9
million barrels a day, but the additional oil is going into
storage, Mr. Armas said. Other officials from Venezuela
confirmed that the country's national oil company can
increase output by 350,000 barrels a day within a week and by
an additional 150,000 barrels a day by year end.
   The UAE could exceed its quota by a similar amount, while
Saudi Arabia is understood to be capable of producing as much
as two million barrels a day over its quota, making up 50% of
the four million barrels of oil taken out of world markets by
the embargo.
   Supporting the wish of those three countries to raise
output is a delegation from Kuwait's government-in-exile.
Heading the delegation is Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's
finance minister and former oil minister.
   Sheik Ali was the architect of Kuwait's long-standing
practice of over-production. That practice particularly
enraged Iraq, which contended the excess Kuwait production
depressed oil prices and kept Iraq from gaining funds needed
to rebuild its war-torn economy.
   Sheik Ali slipped out of Kuwait the night of Iraq's
invasion and has been shepherding his country's vast global
investments and its oil policy from exile. He had little to
say on his arrival other than to express hope for an
agreement on increased quotas for "those who can produce"
more.
   Others backing the Saudi-Venezuela proposal are the United
Arab Emirates, Ecuador and Qatar. Delegates from these
countries not only support expanded output by OPEC's
producers but also recommend that consuming nations draw
additional supplies from their government and commercial
stockpiles. That combination, they argue, would change the
market psychology that has resulted in a doubling of oil
prices since June.
