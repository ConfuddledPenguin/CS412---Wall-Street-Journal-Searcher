   By the end of the month, as many as 40,000 U.S. military
reservists may be called to leave their jobs, and employers
across the U.S., from auto makers to penitentiaries, are
scrambling to figure out how their work forces will be
affected.
   The call-up, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the
establishment of a U.S. force in Saudi Arabia, has raised
delicate issues for employers. Not only must they shuffle
work forces because of job vacancies, but they must also
decide how -- and if -- reservists are to be paid if called
up. Benefits, too, both for the employee and for the
employee's dependents, pose another question.

   The sudden crisis in the Persian Gulf has caught most
employers off-guard. Many, ranging from small businesses to
corporate giants such as Xerox Corp. and International
Business Machines Corp. don't even know how many reservists
they employ. "We really have no handle on this," said a Xerox
spokesman. "Until they get called up, we have no idea of who
is a reservist and who is not." Of 29 employers responding to
a poll by consultant Hewitt Associates, only three said they
have a significant number of reservists.
   Questions of pay and benefits for reservists are equally
difficult. Employers aren't required to pay active-duty
reservists, but some make up the difference between the
military and regular pay for a time. Many companies are
maintaining their usual pay plans, but some quickly acted to
bolster the package. Union Pacific Corp. promised to make up
any difference in pay or benefits indefinitely. Insurer USAA
will be paying employees called to duty the difference in pay
for 12 months; health and insurance benefits will be
maintained for two years.
   In the Hewitt survey, 11 companies said they wouldn't
continue the reservists' pay. Another nine said they'd make
up the salary shortfall for periods from two weeks up to six
months. Of the others that responded to the pay question, six
planned to continue pay for varying periods. In a similar
survey by consultant Towers Perrin, 13 of 22 employers said
they wouldn't continue the employee's pay, while nine said
they would (three for just two weeks).
   In general, employers weren't concerned that critical
employees might be called up, but there are notable
exceptions. At General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary,
Bruce G. McDonald, the unit's vice president for
communications, is a brigadier general in the Army Reserve.
Mr. McDonald says that, for now, he doesn't expect to be
called up, which may be fortunate for Saturn. The GM unit is
due to launch its first car this fall.
   The call-up also could put a kink into the space shuttle
Columbia mission that is set to be launched Sept. 1. John
"Mike" Lounge, a physicist, is one of three mission
specialists scheduled to fly aboard the shuttle, and a
reservist with the U.S. Air Force. The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration isn't sure how it would handle the
situation if Mr. Lounge were to be called up, but a
spokeswoman said, "The mission wouldn't be scrapped."
However, no replacement would be fielded.
   Concern about the call-up is felt even at the smallest of
employers. At the Cortland Christian Church in tiny Cortland,
Ohio, Pastor Tom C. Gibson is nervously awaiting a possible
call. Mr. Gibson can't be sure of keeping his particular
position, but he is trying to work out an agreement with
church elders to hold his job and pension and hire an interim
minister if he is called. Last Sunday, the congregation
gathered in its century-old white frame church and prayed for
a peaceful resolution in the Gulf.
   Here are the plans of employers in a variety of industries
for handling the reserve call-up:
   Most auto makers don't know how they will be affected by
President Bush's call-up of the reserves, but the initial
impact looks minimal.
   Ironically, the U.S. plants of Japanese auto makers may be
more affected than Big Three plants. That's because the
Japanese "transplants" have far younger work forces than Big
Three factories, where the average age of workers is about 45
years old.
                                                                                                       

   AUTOS
                                                                                                       

   At Diamond-Star Motors Corp., an auto-making joint venture
between Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., about 4%
of the company's 3,000 employees are reservists. At Toyota
Motor Corp's. plant in Georgetown, Ky., 139 of the 3,350
employees are reservists.
   Most companies, including GM and Ford Motor Co., say
they're studying what to do about the pay issue, and will
announce their decisions soon. GM makes up the difference
between civilian and military pay for 30 days, but is
studying whether to extend that. GM already gives salaried
employees a slightly more generous break than hourly
employees, but it's uncertain whether that will continue.
                                                                                                       

   COMMUNICATIONS
                                                                                                       

   Some communications companies moved to bolster pay to
reservists called up to active duty. Nynex Corp., which
believes it has some 300 to 500 reservists, enhanced its
program for military reservists by extending the time it will
pay the difference between an employee's salary and military
pay to six months from two weeks. Group insurance programs
will be continued at current levels.
   Pacific Telephone, Pacific Telesis Group's telephone
operating company, said some 766 employees are active
reservists. The phone company has 61,000 employees. Vacancies
may be filled by temporary help, the company said.
   For reservists who have worked for Pacific Tel for more
than a year, salary differences will be made up for three
months if they have no dependents and up to six months if
they have dependents. For employees with less than a year of
service, the difference will be made up for one week. Pac Tel
will continue benefits until the military starts to pay for
them. Reservists won't lose tenure for up to five years.
   Bell Atlantic Corp. doesn't know how many of its employees
are reservists, but it sweetened its benefit package for
those called to active duty.
   Employees with dependents at Bell Atlantic will receive
salary differential payments for six months if they have been
with the company for more than a year; those with less than a
year at the company will receive it for 3 1/2 months. For
employees with no dependents, the differential pay is for
three months and two weeks, respectively.
                                                                                                       

   HIGH TECH
                                                                                                       

   Like IBM and Xerox, many high-tech companies are trying to
figure out what effect the call-up may have.
   "We're just assessing what the impact might be," said
George Burger, vice president of human resources at Tandy
Corp. The company doesn't know how many of its 39,000
employees are reservists. But its Radio Shack retail outlets
are already feeling the pinch in areas around military bases,
where full-time military personnel frequently work part-time
as Radio Shack clerks.
   E-Systems Inc. surveyed its divisions recently and found
that only about 50 of its 18,000 employees could be affected
by a call-up of the reserves. E-Systems will continue to
provide insurance and other benefits to reservists and their
families for six months.
   Digital Equipment Corp. had just six employees out of
125,000, called to active duty as of last week. The total is
expected to rise as reservists get their orders in coming
days.
                                                                                                       

   POLICE

   Like corporate America, police forces are trying to assess
the impact of the callup. The assessments vary widely.
   In Jackson, Miss., the police are hoping that not all 23
of their policemen in the reserves are called up anytime
soon. The department, which has about 350 policemen, is
already about 75 officers short, partly because of attrition,
partly because of a budget squeeze. The force expects to
bring on 18 new police recruits in November. But, says Sgt.
Chip Pippen, "If we lose 23 people, it would deplete our
ranks pretty good."
   Mayer A. DeRoy, chief of police in Pittsburgh, said he
expects up to 24 of his force's 1,150 officers, ranging from
the lowest in rank up to commanders, to be called. "This will
spread us a little bit thinner," said Chief DeRoy. "But it
won't wreak havoc on the city of Pittsburgh."
   At the Georgia Department of Corrections, 390 correctional
officers, or 7% of the state's total, are reservists. A
spokesman said the corrections department immediately
developed contingency plans to ensure that the level of
security wasn't diminished. In some cases, officers will work
overtime to fill vacancies caused by reservists. Certain work
programs outside the facilities, such as prisoner's picking
up litter along highways, may be curtailed or cut altogether
to be sure there are enough bodies to guard the jails.
                                                                                                       

   SMALL BUSINESS
                                                                                                       

   According to the National Federation of Independent
Business, the largest membership organization for
small-business owners with about 600,000 members, some
smaller firms still are confused about their obligations to
reservists and have begun calling NFIB's Washington
headquarters for information.
   One potential problem is that most business owners are
assuming that the reservists will be on active duty for a
short period of time, perhaps three to four weeks, said NFIB
spokesman Terry Hill. He notes that small business would be
seriously hurt if they lose key employees or the owner and
chief executive for an extended time.
   "We're very concerned. There are so many aspects to this
thing, no one knows which way it'll go," he said.
                                                                                                       

   DEFENSE
                                                                                                       

   Martin Marietta Corp. estimates that fewer than 1,000 out
of its total work force of 65,000 are reservists. Marietta is
studying the financial impact this crisis might have on
employees and their dependents. No new policy or changes have
been developed yet.
   United Technologies Corp. said it would continue to pay
employees who are called up for active reserve duty the
difference between their military pay and their normal
salaries, and would continue all benefits. A spokesman for
the Hartford-based company said the extra pay would be
extended for 90 days from departure, and that the policy
would be re-evaluated at that time.
   The company estimates that roughly 1,000 of its 115,000
U.S. employees are in the military reserves. By late Friday
afternoon, none had informed the company that they had been
called to active duty.
   Boeing Co. hurriedly began sorting its personnel files for
reservists among its 160,000 employees world-wide late last
week in an effort to determine how many might be affected.
Although the count hadn't been completed by Friday, a Boeing
spokesman said it may have a "large number" of test pilots
and aircraft maintenance workers who are in the reserves.
Boeing makes up the difference between reservists' regular
pay and military pay for as many as 20 days of military duty
over a two-year period.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH CARE
                                                                                                       

   The University of Illinois Hospital's and Clinics in
Chicago is bracing for the worst. "It could cripple some of
our hospital services" if its reservists are called, a
spokeswoman said. Although she didn't know how many of the
hospitals 150 doctors and 1,100 nurses are reservists, "there
are key staff members, departments heads and head nurses, who
are members of the reserves. They're not the type of
employees you could replace easily."
   Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas said it doesn't know
how many of its employees are in the reserves but it has
identified about a dozen employees, none doctors, who belong
to the reserves. But of those, three are nurse midwives.
   FHP International Corp., a health maintenance organization
with 7,500 employees, said 75 employees, or 1% of its work
force, are in the reserves, and that the potential for being
called up has already had a broad effect on the company. "You
lose some productivity when people are uncertain and worried
about what is going to happen to them," says Wanda Lee, vice
president of human resources.
   Earlier this week, the company began intensifying its
recruiting efforts, contacting temporary services for
physicians and nurses, alerting them that they will be in
need of personnel in the coming months. Unfortunately, other
medical companies are doing the same, and shortages may
result, Ms. Lee said.
                                                                                                       

   AIRLINES
                                                                                                       

   Airlines may be hit particularly hard by the call-up
because both pilots and aircraft are needed. Out of some
7,500 to 8,000 Delta Air Lines' pilots, several hundred are
reservists. A few pilots have been called up sporadically in
recent days. A Delta spokesman says the airline has been
filling in the vacancies as it normally does, with pilots on
standby to substitute. "We don't anticipate any schedule
disruptions," he said.
   A spokesman for AMR Corp.'s main carrier, American
Airlines, said that 22 of its 8,500 pilots had been called up
for active duty. American said it suspended a regularly
scheduled daily round-trip flight on each of two routes,
Dallas/Fort Worth-Honolulu and Newark-Los Angeles, freeing up
two DC-10 aircraft, which American said the government had
requested to shuttle personnel and cargo to the Middle East.
A company spokesman noted that two daily flights are still
available on each route.
   AMR's regional carrier division, AMR Eagle, said that 86
of its 5,200 employees, including 52 of about 1,500 pilots,
had been contacted by the military. "We aren't losing a lot
of people from any one place," said a spokesman.
   On the ground, Union Pacific, went a step further than
many firms, promising to make up any difference in pay or
benefits indefinitely. A company spokesman said Friday that
about 400 of Union Pacific's 48,000 employees are active
reservists, but he didn't know how many of them had been
called up.
