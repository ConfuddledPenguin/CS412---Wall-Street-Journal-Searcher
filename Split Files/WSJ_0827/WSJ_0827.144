   Thank you for bringing to your readers' attention the
current debate over Flat Mountain Pond in the Sandwich Range
Wilderness here in the White Mountain National Forest (July
26).
   I and other members of the Sandwich Conservation
Commission have appealed the U.S. Forest Service's decision
to build a road on this trail. The commission is a town board
appointed by the Sandwich selectmen. Town voters discussed
this issue at our March town meeting and resoundingly opposed
the road. Appellants in this case are not a uniform group of
ignorant and rabid environmentalists. Nor are we "unnatural
foes" of the disabled. We are the citizens of a small
American town that happens to include 20,000 acres of a
national forest; we have worked with the U.S. Forest Service
since before the White Mountain National Forest was
established in 1911.

   There was extended public debate and then consensus on a
boundary for the Sandwich Range Wilderness. More debate
yielded consensus on a 10-year management plan that allows
motorized access on some trails and no motorized access on
others, Flat Mountain Pond Trail for one. And we have offered
to help the Forest Service develop various new facilities for
disabled visitors to the Sandwich Range.
   Now suddenly, the Forest Service has made a decision to
bring motors to the edge of a pond recognized as the most
remote and isolated water in the entire national forest. Our
argument is not with who drives those motors. Our argument is
with motors in a federal wilderness.
   This is not a battle between environmentalists and the
disabled. This is a protest by ordinary citizens against a
federal administrative decision that countermands years of
public consensus.
