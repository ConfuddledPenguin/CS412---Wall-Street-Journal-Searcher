   Fidelity Federal Bank of Glendale, Calif., will acquire
two insolvent thrifts in California, the Resolution Trust

   Fidelity Federal will acquire the six offices of Westwood
Savings &amp; Loan Association, Los Angeles, and assume $437.5
million in deposits and secured liabilities from the failed
thrift. The RTC will advance $395 million to Fidelity Federal
and retain about $301.1 million of the closed institution's
assets. After the sale of assets, the ultimate cost to the
RTC is estimated at $259.5 million.
