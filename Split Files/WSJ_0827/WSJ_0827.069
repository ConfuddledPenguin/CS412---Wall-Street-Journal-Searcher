   Federal regulators have agreed to retain a high-powered
legal team from the New York law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore
to recover thrift losses they believe may have been caused by
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Michael Milken, its former
junk-bond king.
   According to individuals familiar with the agreement in
principle, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it would
retain Cravath partners David Boies and Thomas Barr earlier
this month. The unusual agreement, which calls for Cravath to
work partly on a contingency-fee basis, is expected to soon
be submitted to the FDIC's board for approval. In a
contingency-fee arrangement, law firms earn a percentage of
the money they win for their client.

   Banking industry observers said that by agreeing to hire
Cravath, the FDIC is showing that it intends to use an
unprecedented amount of firepower to prove allegations that
Mr. Milken helped thrifts that were big Drexel customers to
fraudulently swap high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds and
record artificial profits on the sales. No such charges have
ever been filed against Mr. Milken or Drexel. A Cravath
official declined to comment on the assignment. Spokesmen for
Drexel and Mr. Milken weren't available to comment.
   "You have to hire someone who's pretty sophisticated,
someone with a lot of resources, if you're going to get at"
the so-called daisy chain, said William M. Isaac, a
Washington banking consultant, referring to the network of
savings and loans Mr. Milken worked with. Retaining Cravath
is a "sensible way to proceed because you're going to have a
lot of big fights on this one," added Mr. Isaac, a former
chairman of the FDIC.
   Messrs. Boies and Barr are among the country's best-known
litigators. Mr. Boies made his name successfully defending
CBS Inc. against a libel suit brought by retired Gen. William
Westmoreland and guiding Texaco Inc. out of bankruptcy-court
proceedings. Mr. Barr was the chief strategist of
International Business Machines Corp.'s defense against
government antitrust cases more than a decade ago. They will
work with a team of more than a dozen Cravath partners and
associates.
   The FDIC, which investigates possible fraud at insolvent
thrifts, hires hundreds of outside law firms each year. Last
year, it paid about $500 million in legal fees to lawyers in
the private sector. But the FDIC usually must settle for
firms that are a cut below Cravath in quality because the
agency won't pay top dollar and many law firms with banking
expertise can't do the work because of conflicts.
   The FDIC launched a special task force in June to
investigate whether Drexel contributed to the savings and
loans failures and to pursue losses in Drexel's bankruptcy
case. Drexel filed for bankruptcy-court protection in
February.
   Besides assisting the FDIC in Drexel's bankruptcy case,
Cravath will help the agency develop legal theories that
could enable the FDIC to recover hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   Individuals familiar with the FDIC's investigation say
Cravath will be focusing on Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association, CenTrust Savings &amp; Loan and Columbia Savings &amp;
Loan, among others.
   FDIC general counsel Alfred J.T. Byrne is understood to
have approached Cravath earlier this year about taking the
assignment. Mr. Byrne declined to comment, saying only that,
"We are considering, among other firms to assist us, major
New York firms." He added that an announcement would be made
soon.
   The FDIC won't have an easy time recovering losses
suffered by thrifts with ties to Drexel. But it may believe
it is in a no-lose situation. Plea agreements entered into by
both Drexel and Mr. Milken to settle civil and criminal
charges against them called for the establishment of
restitution funds. The more than $700 million is to be used
to settle civil claims against Drexel and Mr. Milken.
   Cravath is doing the work relatively inexpensively and has
incentive to try to recover as much money as possible for the
FDIC. Under the proposed arrangement, Cravath won't be
getting its usual fees, which top $400 an hour. Instead, the
FDIC will reimburse Cravath for many expenses and will pay a
sharply discounted hourly rate. The law firm will also get a
percentage of whatever money it recovers.
