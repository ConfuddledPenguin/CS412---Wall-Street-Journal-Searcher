   WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department, bowing to
congressional pressure, said it would slash by 40% the number
of LH helicopters it plans to buy and delay production of the
new aircraft by about two years.
   The Pentagon, as part of an in-depth review of big-ticket
weapons programs by Secretary Dick Cheney, said it wants to
buy 1,292 of the new lightweight Army helicopters at an
annual rate of 120. They'd replace the current fleet of AH-1,
OH-6 and OH-58 choppers at a cost of $34.2 billion.
Previously, the Pentagon had planned to buy 2,096 LHs at a
cost of $42 billion.

   Critics in Congress have questioned the cost of the
helicopter, its necessity in light of the diminished Soviet
threat and its ability to survive attack from the ground. In
addition, the Senate has voted to require that the Army build
prototypes of the helicopter before it starts assembling a
final production model. The Army originally had planned to
rely just on engineering analyses before putting production
tooling in place.
   In its decision, announced Friday, the Pentagon largely
acquiesced to the Senate requirement, saying it would build
six prototypes before deciding on a production model. The
first LH helicopters for actual use now are expected to come
off the production line in December 1998, about two years
later than scheduled. "We're falling in line" with the
Senate's position, said an Army spokeswoman.
   Yet given the effort by some lawmakers, especially Rep.
Larry Hopkins (R., Ky.), to scuttle the LH program
completely, the Pentagon's long-awaited call to push ahead
with development was greeted by the contractors on the
project as welcome news.
   They cited, in particular, Mr. Cheney's assertion that the
Army's current fleet of helicopters does "not meet the
projected threat." In a letter dated Thursday to Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the secretary
maintained that "the collapse of the Warsaw Pact does not
alter the need for the LH," saying that crises such as the
one currently in the Persian Gulf "require a versatile and
more flexible force."
   "In light of all the programs that the Pentagon has
canceled or has gone back to a study phase on, we're pleased
with its decision," said Al Haggerty, director of a team made
up of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Textron Inc.'s Bell
division -- one of two teams competing for the LH accord.
"We're talking about hundreds of people that could have been
out of work had they zeroed it," he said.
   The other team is made up of Boeing Co. and United
Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky subsidiary. The Army plans to
choose between the two teams in February 1991. The industry
has already poured a total of about $450 million into the LH.
   A Sikorsky spokesman said he couldn't comment as to what
the Army's newly proposed production rate of 10 a month might
mean for his team. But Mr. Haggerty asserted: "This will keep
the momentum going, the technology moving." The new rate, he
said, would allow for adequate efficiency and "certainly
isn't something that anybody in the industry would turn their
nose up at."
   Still, the Pentagon announcement doesn't end the program's
political problems. The House Armed Services Committee, for
instance, has approved language calling for the Army to scrap
the LH and come up with an improved design, which it calls
the Scout attack helicopter. "We want them to go back to the
drawing board," a committee spokeswoman said. Mr. Haggerty
countered, however, that the measure being advanced by the
House panel seems more a matter of semantics than substance;
the LH's mission, he insisted, hasn't been changed.
   The Pentagon describes the LH as an armed reconnaissance
helicopter that can perform at night, in bad weather and in
hot climates with a range unmatched by current helicopters.
