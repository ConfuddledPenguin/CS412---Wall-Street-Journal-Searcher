   Penn Central Corp., amending its previously announced
offer, said it will buy back 10 million shares of its 62.7
million outstanding at $23 a share.
   Penn Central, which has businesses in industrial
manufacturing, defense services, insurance and energy, said
it was modifying its offer because of a "deterioration in
general market conditions, including the market price of the
company's common stock."
