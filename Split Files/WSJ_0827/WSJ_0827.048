   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted foreign trade
deficit widened to a preliminary 4.64 billion francs ($893.9
million) in July from a revised 877 million francs in June,
which previously was estimated at 1.03 billion francs, the
National Customs office said.
   Unadjusted July results showed a deficit of 3.78 billion
francs, compared with a revised June gap of 415 million
francspreviously estimated at 592 million francs -- and a
July 1989 deficit of 3.38 billion francs.

   The latest results brought France's adjusted trade deficit
for the first seven months of this year to 17.67 billion
francs, a narrowing from the year-earlier deficit of 24.73
billion francs. On an unadjusted basis, this deficit narrowed
to 23.55 billion francs from a gap of 29.3 billion francs in
the 1989 first seven months.
