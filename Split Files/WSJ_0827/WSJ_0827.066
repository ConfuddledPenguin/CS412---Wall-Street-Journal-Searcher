   LONDON -- Forces in the Persian Gulf may be armed with
state-of-the-art equipment, but British television is relying
on turn-of-the-century visual aids.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s flagship "Newsnight" program has used a studio model
about the size of a pingpong table to illustrate the naval
and troop buildup in the Persian Gulf. In nightly maneuvers
reflecting the day's military developments, tiny green tanks
deploy menacingly along the Iraqi-Saudi border. Miniature
U.S. jet fighters swoop over sand-colored polystyrene hills.
And the Persian Gulf becomes increasingly crowded with metal
warships marked with flags, like bite-sized sausages at a
July 4th picnic.

   The tone of the program -- usually a sophisticated hybrid
of ABC's "Nightline" and the U.S. networks' nightly news --
changes when avuncular BBC anchorman Peter Snow runs to his
table-top sandbox. There, he plays out tactics with a platoon
of retired British admirals and generals.
   To some people, this seems unseemly. "It struck me as
children playing with their toys -- like an elaborate train
set," says John Lyttle, television critic at Britain's
Independent newspaper.
   The BBC defends the #1,200 ($2,350) model as an efficient
way to illustrate the fast-changing Gulf situation. "It may
be seen to be unsophisticated," says Tim Gardam, editor of
"Newsnight." "But it has greater flexibility and greater
clarity than two-dimensional computer graphics." In
particular, he says it shows three-dimensional terrain --
useful for strategic commentary -- better than the "quick
graphic movements, little blobs and clipped interviews" that
he sees on U.S. networks.
   The program's producers may be just getting back into
practice; the BBC used similar models to illustrate the
Falklands War and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But
they display a gift for ingenuity. When news broke late that
hostages in Kuwait would be moved to city hotels, the BBC
improvised with what looked like matchboxes placed on end.
When Yemen decided an hour before airtime that it wouldn't
unload an Iraqi tanker, one metal ship found itself adrift in
the Gulf.
   But this model's days may be numbered. Mr. Gardam says the
program, which has a modeler, three producers and an
assistant manipulating the sandbox, is working on a bigger
and better version.
