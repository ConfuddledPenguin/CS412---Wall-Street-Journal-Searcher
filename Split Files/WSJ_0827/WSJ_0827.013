   In 1909, Abraham Flexner surveyed American medical schools
for the Carnegie Foundation and discovered the following
facts: Many schools had either nominal or no specific
entrance requirements; the schools were set up essentially as
moneymaking ventures (with education only a byproduct); there
were no uniform standards or curriculums; degrees were
conferred by institutions that sprang up as quickly as a
faculty could be assembled, regardless of how well trained
the instructors were; medical degrees became devalued as a
growing number of graduates with sub-par training entered the
profession. Finding that medical education lacked both
regulation and uniformity, he recommended sweeping reforms.
   During the past decade, similar trends have taken place at
American business schools. Today, the number of institutions
offering MBA degrees, or their equivalent, has nearly doubled
to 700. A steady rise in applicants to graduate business
programs, particularly foreign nationals, has continued as
well, and it is conceivable that the number of both graduates
and degree-granting institutions will double again within the
decade.

   While that's good news for the cash-starved universities
seeking to fill excess capacity by starting low-cost,
high-margin business schools, the increasing variety of new
MBAs has created a growing problem for employers. The
employers use the MBA degree as a screening mechanism, in the
belief that someone with the degree should be better
qualified than someone without one, all other things being
equal. But there are so many schools offering MBAs that it's
difficult to ascertain who has really learned something of
value.
   What happens in the case of two equally qualified job
applicants who both have MBAs, but from different schools?
Can one judge the relative strength of an applicant based on
the reputation of his or her alma mater? Is a B-plus from one
business school necessarily better than a C-plus from
another?
   The answer to all these questions is, of course, that
employers can't tell whether one person's MBA is any better
than someone else's, until they test them. In an effort to
hire people who are truly qualified -- not just credentialed
-- employers are doing precisely that. The Educational
Testing Service (of SAT fame) now has a burgeoning business
helping employers find out what MBA graduates actually
learned in their business-school careers.
   If, as it appears, employee tests are the wave of the
future, no one is more to blame than the business schools
themselves. To find more and better MBA students, B-schools
have touted the vast quantity of money their students are
likely to earn upon graduation, rather than the quality of
the education they're likely to gain in the process. The top
20 B-schools, particularly, publicize the starting salaries
of their MBA graduates as one way of claiming their vaunted
status. They implicitly argue that they must be teaching
something of use because the marketplace values their
products so highly.
   Unfortunately, as the number of business schools has
increased, those starting-salary statistics have become less
meaningful. Top business schools -- which boast average
starting salaries of more than $64,000 -- may claim that
their graduates are better simply because they earn more. But
it can also be argued that those schools also have the
highest entering-class salaries of any business schools.
Statistics of those kind aren't reported, but it's safe to
say that the best B-schools select a majority of students who
were earning close to $50,000 before they matriculated.
   In 1982, the year I entered the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business, the average age of my classmates
was 24, the average length of work experience was slightly
more than two years, and the average starting salary upon
B-school graduation was $35,000. Today at Chicago, the
average age of matriculating students is nearly 27, while the
starting salaries upon graduation have jumped to $55,000. Are
the students better prepared now, hence the higher salaries,
or do these numbers need to be adjusted for inflation?
Neither is the case. Chicago, Harvard, Stanford and all the
other top business schools have simply started admitting more
students with four, five or six years of work experience,
people who already earn substantial incomes.
   Then how much is an MBA now worth? If you were earning
$50,000 before you went, and two years later, after an
investment of $30,000 or more, you're re-hired at $60,000 or
$65,000, was it worth the investment? Leaving aside the
immediate financial gain, if any, will your career blossom
because you now have the skills and knowledge that your
employer needs? Presumably these questions could best be
answered by employers based on their prior experience with
hiring MBAs. But given that they're now forced to screen
potential employees with standardized tests to find out if
they're qualified, it's clear that the MBA degree, by itself,
is becoming relatively less meaningful to them.
   Because graduate business schools, including most notably
the Harvard Business School, are moving away from even using
the standardized GMAT as an entrance requirement, the need
for some standard in business education is becoming ever
greater. At the same time, schools will continue to admit
overqualified applicants, with many years of work experience
(for whom the real value of an MBA is far less than its
nominal value), which makes placement statistics look better.
   Up to this point, graduate business schools have resisted
all efforts to standardize either curriculums or graduation
requirements. It's likely that the only way in which such
reforms are likely to come about is if employers themselves
demand them. At one time the chances of that happening were
remote, but with more companies taking matters into their own
hands it's becoming a real possibility.
   As many recruiters will attest, it's quite possible for
students to graduate from even top business schools knowing
or remembering virtually nothing about accounting, economics,
finance or marketing, and having no certifiable business
skills whatsoever. Clearly, business schools today are at the
same point that medical schools were in 1909, before the
publication of the Flexner Report.
