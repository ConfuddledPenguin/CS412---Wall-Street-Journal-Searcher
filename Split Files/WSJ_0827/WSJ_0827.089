   MOSCOW -- Soviet authorities sought to reassure smokers
that there will be enough tobacco in the days to come,
following increased public outrage over the worst cigarette
shortage in decades.
   State-run newspapers reported that a Moscow factory had
produced 45 million cigarettes in 24 hours over the weekend,
that a special command post was ensuring the packs made it to
tobacco kiosks instead of the hands of black marketeers, and
that authorities were cracking down on the black market
speculators.

   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov tried to calm the Soviet
Union's 70 million smokers on national television by
similarly pledging that more cigarettes -- both domestic and
imported -- were on the way.
   But Mr. Ryzhkov dodged responsibility for the crisis,
saying the shortage wasn't the fault of the central
government, but of the leadership of the individual Soviet
republics. He also blamed panic-buying by the public.
   Beneath a banner headline pleading "Government, give us a
smoke]" the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper devoted its entire
front page to the crisis, chronicling the various "tobacco
rebellions" around the Soviet Union since July. The newspaper
reported that a pack of American Marlboro cigarettes would
bring up to 20 rubles ($32) on the black market in Moscow.
   The actions underscored how seriously national and local
authorities are taking the summer-long cigarette shortage,
especially in light of street demonstrations by angry smokers
that have been increasing in Moscow and Leningrad recently.
On Wednesday, scores of people blocked a street next to the
Kremlin until a nearby tobacco kiosk was restocked.
   The newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda reported that Muscovites
will be getting ration coupons for tobacco products as a
temporary, two- to three-month measure in order to combat
hoarding and black market speculation.
   The newspaper said that one black marketeer killed a buyer
over a pack of cigarettes in Moscow, but it provided no other
details.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said that in the central Siberian
city of Barnaul, one brand of Soviet cigarettes was being
sold for 7 rubles on the black market. Soviet cigarettes
usually sell for about 45 kopecks per pack.
