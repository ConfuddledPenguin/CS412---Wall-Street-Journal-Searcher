   WASHINGTON -- Baxter International Inc. said in a
Securities and Exchange filing that it intends to sell "all
or part of" its 7.3% stake in Genetics Institute Inc.
   Baxter, a medical products and services concern based in
Deerfield, Ill., currently holds 1,021,374 shares; in
national over-the-counter trading Friday, Genetics Institute
stock fell $2 to close at $27.25 a share, valuing Baxter's
stake at $29.4 million.

   Baxter's filing gave no reason for its decision to sell
its holdings in the Cambridge, Mass., pharmaceuticals
concern. Baxter doesn't have a representative on Genetics
Institute's board.
   Under a licensing agreement with Genetics Institute,
Baxter will make and market a genetically engineered
hemophilia drug developed by Genetics Institute. Genetics
Institute and Baxter applied in May for approval from the
Food and Drug Administration to market the drug; a Genetics
Institute spokeswoman said the companies expect approval in
"mid- to late 1991."
   Baxter president Wilbur H. Gantz said in a statement: "Our
decision to reduce our holdings in Genetics Institute stock
supports our own financial goals," and that proceeds would be
used to reduce Baxter's debt. He added that Baxter has "an
excellent working relationship" with Genetics Institute, and
is "especially enthusiastic" about their joint effort to
develop and market the hemophilia drug.
   The drug, known as Recombinate, is a genetically
engineered form of the bloodclotting protein Factor VIII,
which is used by hemophiliacs. The drug is thought to hold
promise as one way to prevent the transmission of blood
diseases through the use of Factor VIII derived from plasma.
