   Philip Mattera, according to his book blurb, is a former
reporter for Fortune magazine. And, judging by his footnotes,
he does read the business press. How could it come to pass,
then, that such a person could write a book urging the U.S.
to retrofit itself as some sort of Eastern European nation --
say, Romania -- before the Berlin Wall tumbled down?
   "Prosperity Lost" (Addison-Wesley, 247 pages, $19.95) is
one weird book. It mostly describes how down at the heels the
U.S. has become. There is nothing much new on Mr. Mattera's
list: The rich are becoming richer, the poor, poorer. There
is a lack of affordable housing. Workers are being treated
like a second-class work force. The economy suffers from
deindustrialization and shrinking unions. Government policy
has put America up for sale to foreigners. And, if inviting
foreigners to own us wasn't bad enough, business is locating
production on foreign shores.

   Nothing seems right to this poor benighted baby. In fact,
even the good stuff generated by the U.S. economy is actually
bad stuff masquerading as good stuff. Mr. Mattera recognizes
that we are creating jobs, but complains that they are lousy
ones. He admits that living standards for senior citizens
have dramatically improved, but cautions that they still are
"vulnerable" to poverty. He concedes that the majority of the
work force is covered by health insurance, but is outraged
that some must pay a portion of their medical expenses
themselves.
   The whining of This Poor Benighted Baby is relieved only
by the whining of the citizens he quotes. We read employees
whining about the demands of their employers, home owners
whining that their castles are located too far from their
jobs, deadbeats who have defaulted on their student loans
whining about their debts.
   But there always will be grumblers among us trotting out
tired complaints. It is when T.P.B.B. proposes his solutions
that he takes off toward Planet Debbie. What he wants us to
do is "tear down the barrier between people's income and
their needs." How? Fasten your seat belts and consider:
   1. The government should establish a maximum wage -- a
limit beyond which accumulation would be illegal. And here I
really must quote or you won't believe me: "Admittedly it
would be difficult to enforce such ceilings on income and
wealth. In the case of chief executives of publicly held
companies, the federal reporting requirements would help in
keeping tabs. Otherwise, we would have to depend on zealous
federal investigators who would be using the Forbes 400 list
for an entirely different purpose than its originators
intended."
   2. The government should establish a guaranteed income.
Where would the money come from? Again, I must quote: "As for
the ability of society to pay . . . it is important to keep
in mind that affordability is ultimately a political rather
than an economic concept." (Could I make this stuff up?)
   3. The government and the banks could forgive the "monthly
vigorish demanded by MasterCard and Visa."
   4. The government should reduce the 40-hour work week. Oh
dear, I must quote again: "It is insane to have a society in
which some people work ridiculously long weeks while others
cannot find a job at all." In fact, making it illegal to work
over a certain number of hours "may also be the cure for the
workaholism that afflicted so many white-collar types during
the 1980s."
   5. The government should pay women who do housework and
child-care more income than men.
   6. Private pension plans should be controlled by unions
who would take over all residential construction and offer
low mortgage rates.
   7. There should be limits on the international mobility of
capital to discourage multinational corporations.
   In short, what T.P.B.B. is proposing is a kind of Soviet
Union: a police state with strict limits on the accumulation
of income and wealth, a massive redistribution of income from
the industrious and upright to the lazy and profligate, and a
wicked shortage of housing by making it "affordable."
   Indeed, the only aspect of state socialism that T.P.B.B.
misses is collectivizing farms. Perhaps the U.S. farm program
with its heavy subsidies -- which redistribute income to
farmers -- suits him fine. And, come to think of it, he
doesn't propose converting the dollar into a soft currency as
part of his plan to keep America American.
   You really need to be a P.B.B. to think such programs
would create prosperity, not ensure widespread poverty.
Without getting into a lecture on the beauties of a market
economy, consider what labor productivity would be like once
it was illegal to work hard. Consider what retirement income
would be like if pension plans had to depend on
below-market-rate mortgages. And consider how competitive and
productive corporations would be if they were barred from
locating production and capital where they would earn their
highest rates of return.
   Just where was T.P.B.B. when all those Trabants were
gasping across the border from East to West Germany?
