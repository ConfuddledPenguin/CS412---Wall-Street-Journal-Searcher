   Machine-tool orders placed with U.S. producers fell 11.9%
in July from June levels, as exports fell off sharply.
   Albert W. Moore, president of the machine tool builders
trade association which compiles the data, attributed the
decline to summer shutdowns in manufacturing plants and model
changeovers in the automobile industry.

   Analysts said the decline may also reflect some weakness
in the economy, particularly among smaller machine-tool
customers who may now be deferring orders due to economic
uncertainty. Moreover, analysts noted that prospective buyers
appear to be waiting for the industry's semiannual trade show
in September, when new technologies will be introduced.
   The July 1990 level of $233.75 million in new orders
included a 3.5% decrease in domestic orders, which fell to
$213.45 million from $221.1 million in June. Overseas orders
showed a 54% month-to-month decline, according to the
association, falling to $20.3 million from $44.15 million in
June.
   On a year-to-year basis, though, total orders were up
22.5% from the $190.75 million level of July 1989.
   Orders are "basically hanging in there," said McDonald &amp;
Co.'s Ronald Petrie. "It's not looking great, but it's not
looking bad either."
   Mr. Petrie said large system orders, such as engine-making
machines, have been improving in recent months, while orders
for smaller machine tools are falling off, as buyers
anticipate a worsening economy. "Things that are easily
deferred are being deferred," he said.
   The events in the Middle East aren't likely to hurt the
industry, and rising need for fuel efficiency could boost
machine-tool orders, which tend to rise with oil prices.
