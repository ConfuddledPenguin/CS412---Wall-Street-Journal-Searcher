   Ford Motor Co. said it's extending for two weeks a
temporary shutdown at its Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant
because of a parts shortage.
   The plant was scheduled to reopen Sept. 4 but now is
slated to reopen the week of Sept. 10, the company said. Ford
said the temporary shutdown "is necessitated by a parts
shortage related to start-up of the new 2.3-liter engine."

   The assembly plant builds about 3,700 Ford Mustangs a week
and already has been idle for two weeks. Initially, Ford
idled the plant for one week in mid-August because of weak
demand for the Mustangs. Since then it has been idle because
of the parts shortage.
   The combined four weeks of no production will result in
about 14,000 fewer Mustangs and will idle 2,100 hourly
workers.
