   In litigious times, it's crucial for business to keep up
to date with possible new liabilities. Current events offer
some simple lessons on the risks of employees who use alcohol
or drugs on the job. If you help run an oil company and get
information that a captain on an oil tanker has a drinking
problem, waste no time getting him off that ship. If you run
an airline and three of your pilots are spotted at a bar
before takeoff, ground them and yank their wings.
   Simple, common-sense rules -- unless you operate in
Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Oregon, Washington or the Northern Mariana Islands.
These unlucky places are in the jurisdiction of the federal
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The new rule there is that if
you fire a worker you reasonably suspect of using drugs on
even a hazardous job site, expect a huge lawsuit as your
reward.

   This is the nightmare result for an oil drilling firm
operating in Alaska's North Slope, which must now pay
$360,000 to three former employees it suspected of smoking
marijuana while working on an oil rig. This month's case of
Sanders v. Parker Drilling is a court-made Catch-22, making
efforts to fight drugs on the job at least as risky as
failing to stop drug use. As Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in an
outraged dissent, "This strikes me as a result so
preposterous it would be laughable if it were not so scary."
   Oil drilling in the tundra is dangerous business,
involving delicate work on heavy pipes and equipment in
temperatures of 30 degrees below zero. Serious accidents are
so frequent that Parker Drilling flatly bans the use of drugs
or alcohol. Several years ago, the firm discovered stashes of
cocaine, amphetamines and even LSD, so managers were
understandably alarmed when they got reports that three
workers routinely smoked dope on the job. After getting
signed statements from several co-workers who claimed to be
eyewitnesses, and after confronting the three, the firm
suspended them.
   Naturally, they sued. The appeals court somehow treated
the jury verdict for the workers as a ruling that the three
hadn't used drugs. In fact, there has been no criminal trial
on drug charges. The only legal issue at the trial was
supposed to be whether the firm had violated its contractual
duty to its workers to use good faith in deciding to fire
them. There was good reason to think the three had used
drugs.
   "By affirming the jury verdict against Parker, we are
saying that management erred grievously by failing to send
the employees back onto the oil rig after receiving three
eyewitness reports that they were regularly observed abusing
drugs on the job," Judge Kozinski wrote. "We should not
require company officials to catch employees with a lit joint
hanging from their lips before they can dismiss them for
misconduct."
   The case includes an instructive clash of judicial views.
One of the country's most liberal judges, Stephen Reinhardt,
wrote a separate opinion that treated this as a standard
labor-rights case. The Kozinski view, he said, "would leave
workers stripped of their basic job rights and personal
security." Judge Kozinski, a libertarian/conservative Reagan
appointee, replied that the majority opinion had misconstrued
the contractual issues here and, besides, being protected
from drugged-out coworkers is also a job right.
   For now, count the courts -- or at least the Ninth Circuit
-- as part of the problem when it comes to fighting drugs. It
makes a mockery of justice for the courts to hold an Exxon or
Northwest Airlines liable for failing to keep their employees
sober, then to hold Parker Drilling liable for trying to do
just that. The new rule is: Sued if you do, sued if you
don't.
