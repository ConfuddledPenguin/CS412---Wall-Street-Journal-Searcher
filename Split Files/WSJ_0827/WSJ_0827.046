   LONDON -- Kuwait is bullish on stocks and bonds.
   That's the message the Kuwait government-in-exile is
sending to the world's jittery financial markets, where share
values have plummeted because of investor nervousness about
the prospect of war, higher oil prices and the possibility
that Kuwait could liquidate its massive overseas financial
holdings to raise cash.

   The buy signal was sent out at an unusual weekend news
conference here, held by Kuwait's Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah,
minister of finance. Sheik Ali is one of the senior
government figures responsible for the management of Kuwait's
estimated $100 billion in overseas assets. Since Iraq's
invasion, London has become the refuge and headquarters of
most of Kuwait's exiled business leaders, with a nucleus
forming around the London-based Kuwait Investment Office,
which manages most of the country's overseas holdings.
   Sheik Ali is spearheading efforts to keep his nation's
economy-in-exile thriving despite the Iraqi occupation and a
world-wide asset freeze that hampers normal operations.
   Sheik Ali has spent recent days on a whirlwind tour of
Kuwaiti investments in Spain, Germany and Britain. He said
that because central banks world-wide are allowing Kuwait to
continue to manage its investments, the Kuwait government and
the KIO "don't feel in any way harmed" by the asset freeze.
   In fact, on Friday Kuwait's government-in-exile reportedly
enlarged its previous 20% stake in the West German trading,
metals and chemicals group Metallgesellschaft AG. The
Frankfurter Rundschau, a German newspaper, reported that the
KIO bought shares on the West German stock markets and that
Metallgesellschaft was one of the issues acquired. It didn't
identify the others.
   Sheik Ali said he and Kuwaiti fund managers in Europe have
concluded that recent declines in world market prices may
offer a good buying opportunity. "In the past we have made
money in being contrarians. We think the markets may have
gone down too much," he said.
   Sheik Ali appeared to base much of his reasoning on the
assumption of a quick resolution of the Gulf crisis. He
declined to specify what particular investments the Kuwaitis
are making. But he said the KIO's fund managers are planning
to commit more funds to the German markets and are
considering the same for Britain and much of Europe. He
didn't mention the U.S., where Kuwaiti financial holdings are
widely spread.
   He added that "just as our investment managers are taking
a contrarian view and perhaps going into the market, so our
oil people expect the price of oil to go down." He said some
of the traders responsible for assuring supplies to Kuwait
Petroleum, one of Europe's largest gasoline retailers, are
selling excess stocks.
   London traders say the Kuwaiti investment funds were
active sellers in the world markets for the first few days
after the Aug 2. invasion; since then they have sat mostly on
the sidelines. Sheik Ali said the invasion currently isn't
forcing any sales. "We have plenty of cash. We do not need to
liquidate anything," he said. He added that Kuwait intends to
hold on to its major strategic blocks in blue-chip companies.
In West Germany, for example, Kuwait owns roughly 14% of auto
maker Daimler-Benz AG and just under 20% of chemicals giant
Hoechst AG. In the U.S., it owns Santa Fe International
Corp., a San Francisco-based oil and gas concern.
