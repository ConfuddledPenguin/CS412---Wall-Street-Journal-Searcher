   THE U.S. SIGNALED willingness to seek a diplomatic
solution in the Persian Gulf.
   The Bush administration indicated that, with economic
sanctions now in place, it is willing to look for a
negotiated resolution of its standoff with Iraq. U.S.
national security adviser Scowcroft said it would be "clearly
acceptable" for U.N. chief Perez de Cuellar to begin trying
to mediate.

Cuellar on Thursday. On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council
authorized the world's navies to enforce an embargo of Iraq.
   Iraq allowed the departure of 52 U.S. diplomatic
dependents who had come from Kuwait, but three dependents and
54 embassy staffers were held. Baghdad didn't act to oust
U.S. diplomats in the besieged embassy in Kuwait City.
