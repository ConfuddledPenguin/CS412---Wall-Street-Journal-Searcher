   NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp., which already had agreed to sell
its Home Insurance Co. unit, agreed Friday to an offer by
another investor group to acquire 50.1% of AmBase.
   Shareholders and large investors said the latest
agreement, which is valued at a total of about $1.15 billion,
appears better but cautioned that not enough details have
been provided to properly evaluate either agreement. The
valuation includes $68 million for the equity stake, a $68
million cash infusion and assumption of $730 million of debt
and a $285 million preferred-stock issue.

   The latest agreement comes on the heels of an Aug. 14
accord AmBase reached with Vik Brothers International, a
European-based investor group, to sell the troubled property
and casualty insurance unit in a transaction valued at $905
million, which would include $544 million in cash and
assumption of $76 million of debt and the preferred. That
deal would leave AmBase debt-free but much smaller, with only
Carteret Bancorp, a thrift institution, as its main business.
   However, the investor group, in its agreement, said it
would retain Home Insurance, which generates about 70% of
AmBase's revenue. That would entail little change for the
company, which is saddled with the $730 million in debt. But
shareholders, who have seen AmBase stock plunge from $7.50
before the Vik agreement, could recoup some of the loss in
the group's $4-a-share offer for the 50.1% stake. AmBase
shares closed Friday at $2.375, up 37.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Also, A. Michael Frinquelli, an insurance analyst with
Salomon Brothers, said the latest accord appears better than
the first because it leaves shareholders with a promise that
the company can do better. "What's left could be worth more
later," he said.
   The investor group said it would assume AmBase's debt and
attempt to refinance about $410 million of it through a new
financing facility to be led by Westpac Banking Corp. The
accord also includes a cash infusion of $68 million and
assumption of $285 million in Home Insurance Co.'s preferred
stock.
   In addition, the investor group said it wouldn't retain
George T. Scharffenberger, AmBase chairman, president, and
chief executive officer who would retire if a definitive
agreement is signed. "We're interested in running the
company," said William Walsh, a general partner for Sequoia
Associates, a member of the investor group, which includes
Hermitage Capital Corp., a subsidiary of Financial Securities
Fund Limited Partnership, New York, and Whitman Heffernon
Rhein &amp; Co., New York.
   The group said it would appoint as AmBase chairman Donald
MacNaughton, former chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, and James J. Meenaghan, current chairman and
president of Home Insurance, as president and chief executive
officer.
   The investor group, which had sought Home Insurance
earlier this month but lost the bid to Vik Brothers, said it
didn't consider taking control of AmBase until AmBase stock
plunged to $1.50 last week. "We did not intend on bidding for
control of the company until the market reacted the way it
did to the Vik agreement," said John Mueller of Whitman
Heffernon. "The prospect is that AmBase businesses could be
more attractive in the future."
   Mr. Mueller said that if a final agreement is reached, the
investor group would initiate a tender offer for 50.1% of the
shares outstanding. If not enough shares are tendered by
current holders, the agreement calls for the company to issue
new shares to be purchased by the group, which would bring
its stake to the required 50.1%. AmBase has about 34 million
shares outstanding.
   The investor group also plans to raise as much as $68
million in cash through a rights offering. The rights include
zero-coupon notes, which would carry attached warrants to
purchase 34 million AmBase shares at $2 a share. Shareholders
would have as long as 10 years to exercise that right. If
shareholders don't accept the offer, however, the investors
said they are prepared to make a cash infusion of as much as
$68 million.
   An AmBase spokesman said the company will proceed with
both agreements, pending due diligence and regulatory
approvals, until a definitive agreement is reached one way or
the other, by Sept. 28.
   Under the latest offer, Mr. Scharffenberger would receive
as severance this year's salary of at least $750,000 plus a
five-year consulting contract with a decreasing fee in each
successive year.
