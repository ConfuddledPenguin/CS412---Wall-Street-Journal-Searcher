   NEW YORK -- One fact that makes the current weak economy
so hard to forecast is that it continues to show occasional
signs of strength.
   On Thursday, for example, the Commerce Department reported
that durable goods orders in July, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, rose a strong 2.9%, led by orders for commercial
aircraft.

   This week is likely to see a continuation of the economy's
up-and-down pattern. Today, for instance, analysts expect the
Commerce Department to report that personal income in July
rose by about 0.5%, slightly faster than the 0.4% gain in
June. The main factor, according to Stephen S. Roach, senior
economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., was an acceleration of
wage earnings.
   That may seem paradoxical in view of the fact the
unemployment rate in July jumped to 5.5%, the highest level
in more than two years, from 5.2%. But Mr. Roach says that
40% of the rise was among teenagers, who make up only 6% of
the labor force and aren't the major contributors to income
growth.
   Another report today, however, is expected to show that
personal consumption in July rose by 0.5%, down from a 1.0%
gain in June. Nancy Lazar, an economist at C.J. Lawrence,
Morgan Grenfell Inc., figures last month's spending pattern
was highly uneven: a 1.5% rise in outlays on durable goods
other than automobiles and a 0.8% upturn in services, both
partly offset by a 1.5% drop in autos, with no change in
spending on nondurable goods.
   One of the statistics that is usually fairly easy to
predict is the Commerce Department's index of leading
economic indicators. The index is designed to move up or down
in advance of the general economy, but several of its
components are known before the index itself comes out.
   The performance of the index's components in July,
analysts say, was almost entirely negative. C.J. Lawrence
analysts offer the following estimates for various index
statistics: stock prices, down 0.1%; inflation-adjusted M2
money supply, down 0.3%; manufacturing hours worked, down
0.2%; vendor performance, down 7.9%; and consumer sentiment,
down 0.1%. These declines, C.J. Lawrence says, more than
offset a 0.2% gain in sensitive materials prices and a 0.8%
drop in initial unemployment claims, resulting in a projected
0.2% drop in the index. The index will be announced
Wednesday.
   Also on Wednesday, new home sales for July will be
reported. This statistic has been one of the few bright spots
in the housing industry, showing gains of 2.3% in May and a
strong 8.0% in June. Despite the fact that adjustable rates
on mortgages were still relatively low in July, analysts on
the average say that new home sales probably fell about 5%,
joining the other gloomy housing numbers.
   Manufacturing orders for July, which will be available
Thursday, are expected to be one of the week's bright spots,
rising about 1%. Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley, however,
predicts that shipments will decline slightly after two
months of solid gains and that inventories also will show a
modest decrease.
   After months of something close to a recession, the
manufacturing sector has begun to look a little better.
Employment and inventories have been reduced sharply, making
it easier for companies to benefit from any upturn in demand.
   The chief upturn so far has been in exports. In June
exports reached $34.3 billion, a record high. Together with a
small decline in imports, this reduced the merchandise trade
deficit to $5.1 billion, the narrowest since December 1983.
   Manufacturers, however, are remaining cautious. One
positive factor for exports has been the decline in the value
of the dollar. In a crisis such as the current Mideast
situation, the dollar usually rises as investors seek what
they regard as a haven. It hasn't happened this time, for
reasons that analysts don't fully understand.
   In the past the Federal Reserve has often stepped in to
tighten money and shore up a sagging dollar. At the moment
the Fed appears to be holding policy steady, and few
economists expect any early move toward tighter money. The
hope among analysts is that the Fed instead will at some
point resume its cautious move toward easier money.
   That move came with quarter-point reductions in the
federal funds rate, the fee charged on short-term loans of
bank reserves. Until recently these moves weren't reflected
in significant increases in M2, the most commonly watched
money supply, consisting of currency and most bank deposits.
   In early August, however, M2 began turning upward. Its
growth is still slow, but it may persuade the Fed that its
earlier federal funds moves are having some effect.
