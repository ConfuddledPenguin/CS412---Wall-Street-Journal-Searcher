   NBC hit on a sure-fire way to call attention to its fall
lineup: It previewed five of its new shows last week, a
traditionally dead time when tired reruns rule the airwaves.
   NBC got attention, all right -- but definitely not the
kind it was looking for. The New York Post lambasted its
"Hull High" as "a waste of time." NBC's "Ferris Bueller" is
the "evil twin" of the movie that spawned it, complained USA
Today. The Washington Post opined that "Lifestories," a drama
about gravely ill patients, is "icky."

   The disappointing reviews are yet another piece of bad
news for top-ranked NBC, whose lead over second-ranked ABC
has been steadily dwindling. The early previews laid bare
potential weaknesses in NBC's fall schedule to advertisers
and ad agencies, who just finished committing hundreds of
millions of dollars to the network. They also showed up the
problems inherent in NBC's latest strategy, called "double
pumping," because it involves previewing the pilots for new
series before the season begins and then airing them again
later on.
   The strategy is supposed to "get awareness and early
sampling. That can work if the shows are liked by the
audience -- and will backfire if the shows aren't that good,"
says Arnie Semsky, an executive vice president with ad agency
BBDO, an Omnicom Group unit. "The fact that the critics
didn't like some of {NBC's new shows} isn't going to help.
That's the chance you take when you get out early."
   An spokesman for NBC, a unit of General Electric, concedes
that the early blast of negative reviews is a "concern." But
he notes that there were some good reviews, especially for
"Parenthood," based on the movie of the same name. And he
says NBC stands by its strategy of giving viewers a sneak
preview at a time when viewership levels are usually at rock
bottom. "The one thing we were looking for is viewer
attention. We're trying to attract an audience at a time of
year when we don't normally have good viewership," he says.
   Not surprisingly, the new NBC shows did perform well
against the other networks' reruns. Monday, when three of the
shows made their debut, NBC's overall rating was 27% higher
than the average of the previous four Mondays, the spokesman
says. But ad agency executives counter that those ratings
don't give any indication as to how the shows will actually
fare against competitors after the new season kicks off.
   "The ratings levels in the summer deal with a whole
different level of TV usage, so it's hard to make a judgment
of what they would mean in the fall," says Joseph Ostrow,
executive vice president at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding
Communications.
   Still, ad agency executives generally give a nod of
approval to NBC's "double-pump" gamble, even though the early
previews did end up attracting the torrent of negative
publicity. The early exposure of the new shows can help build
viewership, the executives say. As BBDO's Mr. Semsky reasons,
it's better to take the chance of having a bad show bomb
early on "than to take the chance of a good show getting lost
in the shuffle" of new programming later.
   Other ad executives suggest that NBC might be able to put
the bad news to work, by getting a headstart in tinkering
with its shows to make some improvements. "It may lead NBC to
make changes in the programs themselves or in the schedules.
It might help them in many ways," says Stephen Leff, vice
chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit.
"No one can deny there's been slippage {in NBC's standing},
but I don't think NBC is showing signs of being complacent."
The NBC spokesman, however, says that as of now, no tinkering
is planned.
   The ad executives can afford to be sanguine. NBC
guaranteed certain ratings levels for the new shows and will
have to "make good" on its promises if the actual ratings
fall short.
   In any case, NBC needs to take some gambles if it is to
stay ahead of the competition for the sixth season running.
While most ad executives expect the network to hold on to the
top spot for another year, the gap between NBC and ABC is
closing -- and ABC is luring away the audience most
attractive to advertisers. BBDO estimates, for example, that
despite NBC's projected ratings lead this coming season, the
Capital Cities/ABC unit will tie the leader in ratings for
women 18 to 49 years old and for women who are 25 to 54.
   "Even if {the new NBC shows'} reviews had been
spectacular, the fact is that ABC has been closing in on
NBC," says Foote Cone's Mr. Ostrow. He adds, "I think the
idea of getting those programs on early is a good one. It
gives you an opportunity to test the waters. It's a very
enlightened way of trying to do things."

   Penney's New Attack
                                                                                                       

   J.C. Penney, in its latest bid to burnish its still-frumpy
image, next month will begin airing surprisingly hip ads with
the theme "Fashion Comes to Life."
   The new advertising drive, created by Ayer's Dallas
office, will replace Penney's seven-year-old "You're Looking
Smarter Than Ever" campaign.
   The new TV commercials, which will be supported by a $10
million budget in September alone, feature a catchy tune and
images of good-looking yuppies at work and play. Penney also
plans to run many newspaper ads with more stylish models than
the ones in its past ads.
   Ron Shuler, Penney's director of marketing communications,
said the old campaign helped contemporize Penney's image. But
he said the new campaign should give a more pointed message
to women that Penney's is a good place to shop for clothes
nice enough to wear to work. "We need that consumer to spend
more of her fashion dollar with us," he said.
