   SAN MANUEL, Ariz. -- Magma Copper Co. said it has repaid
in full its bank debt outstanding, which was $32.2 million on
June 30.
   The debt was part of a credit agreement with a group of
banks led by Continental Bank, Chicago, and National
Westminster Bank PLC as co-agents. The copper producer now
has approximately $362 million in unsecured long-term debt,
with no maturities until Dec. 31, 1992.
