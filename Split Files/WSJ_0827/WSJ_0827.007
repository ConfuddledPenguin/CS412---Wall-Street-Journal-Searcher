   ATLANTA -- Dissident Southern Baptists voted
overwhelmingly to set up their own budget and government, in
moves that fell just short of secession from the Southern
Baptist Convention at an unusual three-day meeting here.
   The group of about 3,000, representing the "moderate"
faction of the denomination, voted to establish its own
administrative body, called "the steering committee." And it
voted to withdraw its financial support from Southern Baptist
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., setting up a trust fund
that would support its own causes like foreign missionaries
and possibly a new seminary.

   While there was no formal vote on the subject, many in the
group expect the newly formed committee to hold its own
annual convention, eschewing the huge one that the
denomination holds every June.
   By the end of the meeting, it was unclear whether the
group would eventually decide to split from the denomination,
or whether it would use its money and new voice as leverage
to influence the conservative fundamentalist faction that has
ruled the denomination for more than a decade. The moderates
and fundamentalists are bitterly at odds over the direction
of the Southern Baptist Convention, which has been a big
conservative political force in Washington for the last
decade. The group's actions could cause severe financial
problems for the denomination and could seriously dilute its
political influence.
   Rev. Daniel Vestal of Dunwoody, Ga., chairman of the
committee, said the actions represented the group's attempt
at "renewal" of the denomination, rather than a prelude to
secession. And during the debates, the group rejected several
proposals that would have amounted to an outright break.
   Its members declined to adopt a name for their new
organization, opting instead to call it simply "the
Fellowship." They also rejected a motion to hold a spring
convention in Augusta, Ga., where in 1845 the Southern
Baptist Convention was launched after a bitter dispute with
northern Baptists over the issue of slavery.
   But throughout this meeting, there was open and passionate
talk about secession. And many of the moderate Baptists here
said they thought that a split was inevitable. "I don't see
any reconciling taking place. The wedge {between the two
factions} is being driven in further and further," said
Walker Knight, publisher of SBC Today, a moderate newspaper.
   A workshop on legal issues was dominated by questions
about what would happen if moderates were to form their own
denomination -- how they could sue to regain control of
Southern Baptist institutions and property like colleges,
hospitals, orphanages and retirement homes, into which they
have poured millions of dollars. Several Baptist lawyers
urged the steering committee to hire outside law and
accounting firms that could assist them in such legal
battles.
   An official of the Southern Baptist Convention, who
attended the meeting as an observer, said he thought the
actions taken by the new group amounted to nothing less than
a split. "I think there definitely has been a new
denomination formed," said Lee Roberts, a member of the
denomination's ruling executive committee. "I don't think
there's any question about it."
   The actions represent a new tack for the moderates, who
have fought internally to regain control of the denomination
since 1979. With vastly superior organizational skills, the
fundamentalists since then have tightened their grip on the
denomination. They have barred from the leadership those who
don't share their strictly conservative religious and
political views and have even forced some out of the
seminaries and national Baptist agencies.
   But it is the moderates, who have contributed well more
than half of the denomination's income during that time, more
than 60% by their own estimates. Even with their support, the
denomination has had some financial trouble, leading to a
round of layoffs and the curtailment of some programs.
