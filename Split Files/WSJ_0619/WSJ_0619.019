   ST. LOUIS -- May Department Stores Co. said its Venture
discount store unit filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public
offering of about 14% of Venture's common stock.
   May said the offering will help set a price for the
remaining Venture shares, which it intends to spin off to its
own shareholders after the public offering. May previously
said it was spinning off the discount store unit to
concentrate on its department store operations. Before the
offering, May said Venture will pay it a dividend of $305
million.

   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the
announcement "furthers the likelihood" that May will use the
dividend to buy back its stock. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, May closed at $55.75, down 75
cents.
   The offering of 2.3 million shares, which Venture said it
intends to sell for between $16 and $18 a share, also will
help strengthen Venture's capitalization at a time when the
discount-store industry is in flux. Ames Department Stores
Inc., a big discount chain, is closing stores and
reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Venture said in the filing that it intends to step up the
pace of its new-store openings. It plans four stores in the
current fiscal year, five next year and eight in each of the
following two years.
   The lead underwriter for the offering, which is expected
to close in July, is Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
