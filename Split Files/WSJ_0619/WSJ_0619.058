   As publisher of the Chicago Reader, an alternative weekly
newspaper, Robert A. Roth refuses to read daily papers. He's
afraid their stodgy ways might be infectious.
   Circulation and advertising revenue is slipping at the
nation's metropolitan daily newspapers, but alternative
papers are growing in number and generally posting higher
revenue. The 68 papers that belong to the Association of
Alternative Newsweeklies now reap $100 million-plus in
combined revenue, and their 3.5 million total circulation
includes an enviable share of the coveted 18- to 35-year-old
market, the very group that daily newspapers are having the
most trouble attracting.

   Mr. Roth's Reader, with its lengthy and sometimes
investigative cover stories, comprehensive arts coverage and
listings and fat classified section, is an industry leader.
Averaging 148 pages an issue, it took in $9.4 million in ad
revenue in 1989, its 18th year, up from $6.2 million in 1985.
   Though the alternative press started out as a reaction to
what it perceived as the political conservatism of
establishment papers in the late 1960s, the concept has
translated into a marketing gold mine for publishers who have
stuck with their papers. Alternative papers are proving
attractive to mainstream advertisers -- such as hardware,
stereo and shoe chains -- that are cutting back on mass
marketing through such major media outlets as metropolitan
dailies and television.
   "When the advertising people came up with the word `niche
marketing,' I had a name for who I was all along," says
Stephen M. Mindich, publisher of the Boston Phoenix. Mr.
Mindich's Phoenix Media Communications Group Inc., which also
includes printing operations, an FM radio station in Boston
and a paper in Providence, R.I., had revenue of $17 million
last year. The company plans to spread its niche expertise
next to two UHF television stations in New England.
   Almost all alternative weeklies are free to readers --
generally college-educated and often professional or
managerial types -- and derive their revenue from
advertising. Bicycle and futon stores and kitchen boutiques
with $200 mixers are staple ad clients. But national tobacco
and alcohol merchandisers are starting to see advantages in
"guerrilla buys" in alternative papers, says George Simpson
of Calet Hirsch &amp; Spector Inc., a New York ad agency. Late
last year, Mr. Simpson began buying ad space for PepsiCo
Inc.'s Stolichnaya vodka in the San Francisco Bay Guardian.
So far this year, he says, the ads have helped to boost sales
for the high-priced liquor by 30% in San Francisco.
   Still, "national advertising is never going to be the
bread and butter" of the alternative press, says Susan
Belair, national ad director for the Ruxton Group, which
represents the Chicago Reader and 10 other papers. National
ads are running 2% higher than last year in Ruxton papers,
but they still account for less than 5% of total ad revenue,
she says. Ms. Belair notes, though, that alternative papers
exclude from their national figures movie, music and other
entertainment ads, which account for up to 20% of revenue.
   A surprisingly small number of alternative papers fail.
Some, including the Independent, in Durham, N.C., are
struggling. The New Times, in Syracuse, N.Y., was sold and
became a more traditional community newspaper, and the L.A.
Reader has been losing money for years.
   Though stalwarts of the genre such as the Boston Phoenix
and the San Francisco Bay Guardian sprang up and grew in
cities known for their extensive youth cultures, alternative
papers today are profitable in such unlikely locales as
Chico, Calif., Lafayette, La., and Salt Lake City. Several
cities now have more than one paper, with six in the Bay Area
alone.
   The alternative weeklies group admitted seven new papers
this year and had applications from seven more. One newcomer,
Albie Del Favero, started the Nashville Scene as an
alternative paper two years ago when his investor group
bought a majority interest in a local shopper. After raising
"a little under $500,000" in funding, he recruited a reporter
from the daily Nashville Banner to be his editor and partner.
Other hiring had to be done on a shoestring; for a while the
Scene's photographer was a homeless person.
   Averaging about 32 pages an issue, the paper has since
built a circulation of 60,000. A cover story on allegations
of plagiarism at the Nashville Tennessean prompted the daily
to go public with its investigation, which led to the firing
of one editor and the reprimanding of another. "A lot of
daily newspapers are getting more and more into boosterism,"
Mr. Del Favero says. "We leave that to the Chamber of
Commerce. We're critics."
   Mr. Del Favero projects that his paper's revenue will hit
about $900,000 this year and $2 million to $2.5 million
within five years. Like its larger counterparts, the Scene's
classified advertising is an engine for both revenue and
circulation. Personal ads make it a bulletin board for young
people. "People will stop me at parties," says Bruce Dobie,
the paper's editor, "and say, `Oh, you're the paper with the
great personals.'"
   Some papers are adding "audio personals," featuring the
actual voices of lonely hearts through tapes on a 900-line
telephone service, and they can barely handle demand. The San
Diego Reader (which licenses its name from the Chicago paper)
started running audio personals in November and now averages
400 a week.
   The rising fortunes of alternative papers are stimulating
interest in acquisitions. New Times Inc. in Phoenix, Ariz.,
has been considering buying the Philadelphia City Paper. New
Times bought Denver's Westword in 1983 and spent about $1.4
million to start Miami New Times in 1987. The company's
papers, led by its flagship Phoenix New Times, now gross $14
million a year; the Miami paper became profitable after only
17 months.
   The Chicago Sun-Times, New Times Inc. and the Village
Voice each tried to buy the Chicago Reader over the past few
years, but the paper's owners, who started out in 1971 with
less than $4,000, refused offers of up to $26.5 million. (The
Village Voice, which predates and doesn't belong to the
alternative weeklies association, differs from the group's
members in that it has 100% paid circulation and a strong
national identity.)
   Outsiders also are seeing the lucrative side of the
alternative papers. Russ Smith and a partner sold their
Baltimore City Paper to Scranton Times Co., Scranton, Pa., in
1987 for $3.5 million. The paper's revenue has risen since,
says publisher Donald Farley, but he won't say when the
parent company will earn its investment back. Mr. Smith used
his windfall to start the New York Press in New York City.
   Alternative papers haven't retreated from the
anti-establishment editorial approaches of their early years.
The L.A. Weekly has done "how-to" guides on environmental
activism and stories on what Nicaraguan support groups on the
West Coast can do now that that country isn't so chicly
radical. The Washington City Paper has doggedly followed
political corruption and real-estate machinations in the
nation's capital.
   But the weeklies are taken more seriously now. For the
past four years, the Arizona Press Club's award for
newsperson of the year has gone to staff members of the
Phoenix New Times, including an award for the paper's 1987
probe of the murder of Don Bolles, a reporter for the Arizona
Republic. The Boston Phoenix was the only paper in New
England to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize last year.
Cartoonists Lynda J. Barry, whose work appears in Esquire,
Mother Jones and other magazines, and Matt Groening, of "The
Simpsons," started with alternative papers and still do
weekly strips for them.
   "The alternative press has been onto something that daily
papers have been very slow to understand," says Ken Doctor,
associate editor for features at KnightRidder Inc.'s St. Paul
Pioneer-Press. A former editor and publisher of the
alternative Willamette Valley Observer in Eugene, Ore., Mr.
Doctor works with Knight-Ridder's 25/43 Project trying to woo
young people back to daily newspapers. "The big dailies
laughed at what they considered throwaway sheets," Mr. Doctor
says. "Now there isn't one that doesn't have a Friday
(entertainment) section or isn't trying to customize its
product."
