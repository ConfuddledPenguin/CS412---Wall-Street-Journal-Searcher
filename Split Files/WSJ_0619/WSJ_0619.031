   If drama's based on conflict,
   Must life become a bore,
   Now that peace has broken out
   And we're at odds no more?
   Something tells me deep inside,
   Around the solar plexus,
   We should give thanks we'll always have
   The battle of the sexes.
   -- Richard F. Barrett.

   Warning Signal
                                                                                                       

   "Don't take this personally"
   Is a statement that galls,
   Since it's usually said
   Before the ax falls.
   -- Joshua Adams.

   Contemplation Ration
                                                                                                       

   Meditation soothes me,
   Which is surprising when
   It's something I only
   Practice now and zen.
   -- Gail Cooke.
