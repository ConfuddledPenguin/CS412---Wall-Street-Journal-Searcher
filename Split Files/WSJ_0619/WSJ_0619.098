   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, handing a major setback
to the Securities and Exchange Commission, let stand an
appeals court ruling that said the SEC lacks the authority to
approve trading of new stock "basket" products.
   The high court's action is the third major federal court
decision in recent weeks to undercut the securities
regulator. The two earlier rulings struck down part of the
SEC arsenal against insider trading and an agency rule
mandating equal shareholder voting in most cases.

   The Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal by the
American and Philadelphia stock exchanges, which introduced
the products last year, and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. That leaves intact a ruling in August by a federal
appeals court in Chicago that the new "index participations"
should have been subject to regulation by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, not the SEC. The appeals court
said that the products had characteristics of both securities
and futures and that the law makes such instruments subject
to exclusive CFTC authority.
   The Supreme Court's move places additional weight on
legislation proposed by the Bush administration that would
amend the exclusivity rule to allow exchanges to bring new
products to either regulator for approval. But that
legislation has a tough road through both houses of Congress
and is far from certain.
   Index participations, informally called IPs, allow
investors to trade a broad cross-section of the stock market.
The issue gets cloudier there because the products combine
elements of stocks, futures and even mutual funds. The
futures markets maintain that the baskets are disguised
stock-index futures contracts, which allow investors to bet
on the movement of a basket of stocks without owning the
securities. Stock-index futures fall under the jurisdiction
of the CFTC.
   The securities exchanges contend that the products are
closer to options, which give the holder the right but not
the obligation to buy or sell the underlying security.
Options are regulated by the SEC.
   The products would allow individual investors to play
program-trading strategies that traditionally might have been
out of their financial reach. By pegging the products to the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index or a similar barometer,
investors who couldn't afford to trade hundreds of stocks
could make or hedge market bets.
   Unlike a futures contract, which expire with no value at
the end of its life, IPs contracts generally would force
investors to trade out of the product, roll over the contract
or take delivery of the basket of stocks.
   The appeals court ruling forced the exchanges to shut down
IPs trading after just a few months -- and about $74 million
in face value of the contracts. That decision infuriated the
SEC, and Chairman Richard Breeden has decried the ruling as
forcing new products "into the courthouse before they can be
sold in the marketplace."
   Brandon Becker, the SEC's associate director for market
regulation, said the agency was "disappointed" by the Supreme
Court decision. "We thought it was a securities product that
would better trade under securities regulation and
oversight," he said. "We continue to think that's
appropriate." He added that the Philadelphia exchange has
applied for SEC approval of an amended IPs product, and that
the agency's review is pending.
   CFTC officials said they offered to expedite approval of
the products last year. But the exchanges refused to bring
the products to the CFTC for approval, the agency said. A
CFTC spokesman yesterday said the offer for expedited
approval stands. "It's the chairman's {Wendy Gramm's} call,
but we feel there is no reason for it to be any different,"
the spokesman said.
   Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia exchange,
said the Supreme Court decision "is a major step backward in
the regulation and development of innovative new products" on
Wall Street. He said it underscores the "crazy-quilt pattern
of regulation of the securities industry" and will hurt small
investors looking for new products that help them compete
with large institutional investors.
   In their joint Supreme Court appeal, the Amex and CBOE
argued that the appeals court decision would mean that IPs
could only be traded with sponsorship of a commodity board of
trade. The exchanges also warned that CFTC regulation would
afford less protection than investors would receive under
federal and state securities laws, and that more buying on
credit would be allowed, contrary to the intent of Congress.
   An Amex spokesman only said yesterday that the exchange
supports the administration-backed bill that would permit
securities exchanges to trade IPs and other products.
   The Justice Department, caught between the competing
interests of two regulatory agencies, sided with the CFTC. In
its brief, the department acknowledged the SEC view that "the
development of some new financial products will be chilled by
the imprecision of the {appeals court's} analysis governing
whether a product is a futures contract." But the department
said it's up to Congress, not the courts, to address that
problem.

   STOCK-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACTS are valued based on the
price of the underlying index at the time they expire. A
story in yesterday's edition on index participation contracts
misstated the value.
