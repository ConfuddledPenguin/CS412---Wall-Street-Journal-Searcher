   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Discount department stores are
feeling the sting of a formidable rival, the "category
killer," and Henry Beckersley is one shopper who understands
why.
   Out to buy a new color television, Mr. Beckersley first
went to the Ames discount department store here. Even though
Ames had just seven different models, he found a 20-inch RCA
he liked for $339. But when he couldn't find a salesperson to
demonstrate it, he went to a nearby Highland Superstore.
Specializing in electronics, Highland offered more than 200
models, including the same RCA -- this time for $228. And a
salesman was happy to explain the features.

   "I didn't know Highland was such a good deal," he says
loading the television into his car. "Next time, I know."
   More and more, once-loyal customers of discount department
stores are spending their money at specialty discounters, or
what the industry calls "category killers." Where traditional
discounters such as Ames Department Stores Inc., K mart
Corp., Caldor Inc. and others sell a huge range of goods,
category killers focus on one area of product, such as toys,
electronics or books, offering wider selections and steeper
price cuts. These specialty discounters include companies
such as Crown Books Corp., Toys "R" Us Inc., Staples Inc., a
stationery discounter, and Streamers, a discount party-supply
chain.
   "The competition's crazy," laments John Dunphey, manager
at a Caldor discount department store here. "Executives from
all these chains are in our store every week checking out our
prices; we're in theirs, too, doing the same thing."
   Not too long ago, discount department stores were among
the fastest growing retailers. Now, many are fiscally
tottering. Within the past 13 months, Ames, Maxway, Gee Bee,
a division of Glosser Bros., Heck's Inc., Alco and
Yellowfront Stores Inc. all have filed for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Three others,
Gold Circle, Mars Department Stores and Times Square Stores,
no longer exist at all.
   Analysts say traditional discounters are caught in a
Darwinian struggle, and only a few will survive. A few years
ago, the three largest discounters owned 40% of the cut-price
market, says David Poneman, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co. Today those Big Three -- Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., K mart and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target stores -- do
60% of the estimated $90 billion discount department-store
business. The three chains accounted for most of the
industry's $10 billion sales gain in 1989. The 11% sales
increase pales in comparison to the high double-digit jumps
that the industry saw a decade ago.
   "I think 10 years down the road there will only be three
or four discount chains left in the business," predicts Peter
Monash, head of Monash &amp; Associates, a retail research firm
in Columbus, Ohio.
   The Big Three discounters appear to be holding their own
against the specialty discounters. Wal-Mart, with nearly $26
billion in sales last year, uses its buying clout and new
technology for inventory tracking and bookkeeping to run one
of the leanest discount operations. The Bentonville, Ark.,
retailer is also helped by the fact that most of its stores
are in smaller and less competitive cities. Minneapolis-based
Target has managed to promote an image as a "better"
discounter, attracting a slightly more upscale customer. K
mart, based in Troy, Mich., operates in tougher urban markets
and has been touched more by the competition. Sales in stores
more than one year old have lagged behind inflation.
   Overall, some industry watchers say the discount
department store as a genre may have outlived the simpler era
for which it was built. When they came into being in the
1950s, chains were structured for housewives, who bought most
of the household supplies, says Leo Shapiro, chairman of Leo
Shapiro &amp; Associates, a retailing researcher in Chicago.
"Once a week she drove down in the family station wagon to
the general merchandise discount store knowing she could get
baby clothes in one aisle and hammers two aisles down.
   "Today, with everyone pressed for time," Mr. Shapiro says,
"family members shop for themselves." And they often head out
in search of one particular item, not a range of household
goods. "If they want to buy toys, they go to Toys "R" Us; if
they want to buy paper plates they go to Streamers," Mr.
Shapiro says.
   Defecting customers point to a number of drawbacks with
general merchandise discounters: Small selections in any one
category, disheveled displays, hard-to-find salespeople, long
checkout lines. But price is probably the biggest
consideration. With a few exceptions, category killers have
lower prices than discount department stores because buying a
lot of one kind of product gives them more clout with
manufacturers and distributors.
   The specialty-discounter challenge to traditional
discounters is apparent here in Framingham, where some 100
stores are sprawled across four adjacent malls.
   CVS, Melville Corp.'s drug-store chain, sells a roll of
35mm, 24 exposure Kodak film for $2.49, compared with $3.19
at Bradlees, $3.59 at Ames, $3.49 at Caldor. Similarly, a
shopper can buy a 24-ounce bottle of Listerine at CVS for
$2.88, compared with $3.49 to $3.99 elsewhere. At Lechmere
Inc., a discount appliance, housewares and sporting goods
store, a Hoover Tempo vacuum cleaner sells for $124.98; the
same model at Bradlees costs $139.
   The other day Jon Andrade was stalking the aisles at
Bradlees here, looking for "Pet Sematary," a Stephen King
best seller. He stalked right out. The paperback was
available only as part of an $18.95 four-book gift package. A
few minutes away at Lauriat's Bookstore, he snapped up the
novel for $3.69. Mr. Andrade says he now knows: "When buying
books, go to a bookstore. It's cheaper and quicker."
   John and Micah Oberling of Framingham, hunting for a baby
bath at a Bradlees discount store, gave up because it had
only one kind. Across the street, they found what they wanted
at Toys "R" Us, which had three choices -- all costing less.
   Some discounters are trying to adapt to new shopping
styles. A few have experimented with housing a store within a
store, trying to cash in on the specialty-store idea. Some
include home-office sections or supermarkets. In addition to
its grocery section, Wal-Mart operates Sam's Wholesale Club,
a chain of warehouse-like stores in which merchandise often
is left in shipping crates. K mart has bought a few category
killers, such as Sports Authority, a sporting goods
specialist.
   On the other hand, Zayre Corp. two years ago dropped out
of the discount department store business, selling its chain
to Ames. Now, it has turned its attention solely to the
specialty store business. ("It was the smartest move the
company ever made," comments Kurt Barnard, publisher of
Retail Marketing Report, a New York-based newsletter.)
   Not everyone is ready to kiss off discount stores, though.
"I think the general discount department store and the
specialty discount store can co-exist peacefully," notes
Edward Comeau, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "It's a
question of finding niches" -- and handling them well.
   Caldor, a former May Department Stores Co. subsidiary
taken private by a management group, says it is conceding the
big-ticket items to specialty discounters, and concentrating
on clothing, knickknacks, home products and small appliances,
the way Target stores do. Marc Balmuth, president of the
chain, based in Norwalk, Conn., says: "Toys "R" Us, and
Staples does $60 a ticket. If you're coming in to pick up a
few things for the house, Caldor will be the neighborhood
store to shop in."
   With this mentality -- and a $750,000 face lift -- the
Caldor store in Framingham hopes to increase sales to about
$15 million this year. The store has been doing about $11
million in annual sales, about $3 million dollars less than a
typical Caldor store.
   Traditional discounters also are trying to get out of the
bind they got into with schizophrenic pricing. Constant sale
days led many to switch to "everyday low prices," yet many
continue to run special promotions. In the end, the consumer
has wound up confused.
   Caught in a fierce contest with a growing crop of nearby
specialty stores, the Ames store in Milford, N.H., attempted
to combine "everyday low prices" with specially advertised
promotions. The result: sales declined 18%, when they had
been expected to increase 10%.
   Richard Cristo, the store's manager, isn't optimistic
things will change. "Let's face it, {specialty discounters}
have got a lot better pricing and greater variety," he says,
adding: "The other day I got a letter from my niece. She
tells me, `you're in the wrong business, get out.' You know,
she's right. I don't see an element of security in what I'm
doing."
