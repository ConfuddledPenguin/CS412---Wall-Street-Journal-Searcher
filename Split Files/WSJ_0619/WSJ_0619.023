   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is stepping up its
search for broader alliances amid strong internal debate over
how dependent the company should become on potential
partners.
   Currently, Chrysler is holding "intensified" talks with
Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, says a Chrysler executive familiar with
the situation. The direction of those talks could become
clear within the next month, Chrysler officials say.

   The Fiat talks currently are at a "more advanced and
potentially more substantive stage" than past discussions
between the two companies, said a top Chrysler official, who
asked not to be named. However, he added, it's far from
certain that broader ties between the two companies actually
will result.
   Fiat officials are discouraging speculation that the
discussions will result in their making a sizeable equity
investment in the No. 3 U.S. auto maker. More likely, they
say, is a deal in which Fiat helps Chrysler develop new
models. In return, Fiat might get Chrysler's
pollution-control technology, or perhaps the right to
distribute Chrysler's Jeeps and minivans in Europe.
   Reports that Chrysler and Fiat may be drawing closer
sparked heavy trading in Chrysler's stock yesterday. The
shares closed in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at
$16.50, up 37.5 cents.
   News of the Chrysler-Fiat talks comes in the wake of two
developments that could add impetus to the discussions. Last
week, Chrysler canceled a joint vehicle-development project
with Renault S.A., a clear signal that Chrysler has soured on
the possibility of stronger ties with the French auto maker.
Also, Wall Street is becoming increasingly worried about
Chrysler's financial strength.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. last week lowered its credit
rating for Chrysler. S&amp;P said the auto maker is "particularly
affected" by the increasingly competitive North American auto
market and a "weakening of earnings and cash flow" caused by
softer demand for vehicles. The S&amp;P move followed by one day
Moody's Investors Service Inc. plans to review for a possible
downgrade $22.8 billion of Chrysler debt.
   In its action, S&amp;P also expressed concerns about
Chrysler's ability to handle plans to spend $15 billion in
the next five years on new products as well as to service its
$18 billion in long-term debt and unfunded pension
liabilities. Those factors, S&amp;P noted, seem to outweigh the
near-term benefits Chrysler will get from its ongoing $1.5
billion cost-cutting program.
   With stronger ties to other auto makers, Chrysler can
defray the high costs of developing new products and spread
its limited resources to update a broader array of vehicles.
Chrysler's new-product development has lagged in recent
years, and its market share has dropped as a result.
   However, the risk of alliances is that they might leave
Chrysler too dependent on other companies for its products.
Some executives argue that Chrysler shouldn't be so quick to
relinquish the ability to produce its own vehicles in the
future to solve immediate problems.
   The executive apparently most concerned about this risk is
Robert A. Lutz, president of Chrysler Motors, the company's
major unit. Mr. Lutz has repeatedly said he wants Chrysler to
develop a new small car on its own. The cost-savings of joint
product development, he argues, often are overstated.
   Nonetheless, one possible result of the Chrysler-Fiat
talks is just the opposite scenario. Rather than developing a
small car to replace the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance
in the mid-1990s, Chrysler would build the car off a chassis
that Fiat uses for its Tipo subcompact.
   Another possibility is that Chrysler will turn to Fiat as
a partner for the proposed Jeep JJ that Chrysler was
developing with Renault until last week. The small
sport-utility vehicle was being designed to compete with
vehicles such as the Suzuki Sidekick; but the market for
those vehicles has slipped lately, and it's unlikely that
Chrysler can pull off the project alone.
   Chrysler's existing ventures with other auto makers
include an agreement with Fiat to market Alfa Romeo cars in
the U.S. through Chrysler dealerships.
   In the past 18 months, Chrysler has agreed to form a joint
venture with General Motors Corp. to produce transmission
parts and signed a deal to market midsized cars built in
Canada by Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea. Chrysler has also
started building cars in a new plant in Normal, Ill., with
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan.
   Chrysler has longstanding marketing and
product-development agreements with Mitsubishi, 12.1%-owned
by the U.S. auto maker.
