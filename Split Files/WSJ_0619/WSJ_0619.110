   Mitsubishi Corp. said it is considering setting up a
joint-venture company with Chrysler Corp. in Ontario to
produce medium-sized passenger cars, but the Japanese trading
company emphasized that no decisions have been made.
   A Mitsubishi spokesman said the proposed venture, which
has been under discussion for the past year, would be in
charge of the stamping plants for production of LH cars, a
series of models that Chrysler, based in Highland Park,
Mich., plans to start producing in 1992. Success with the
models is important for Chrysler, which is seeking to reverse
its slipping competitiveness in the North American market.
Though Chrysler has long-established ties in the U.S. with
Mitsubishi Motors Co., the auto maker in the Mitsubishi
group, the Canadian venture would be pursued separately, the
spokesman said.

cars in North America, and that total investment in it would
reach $105 million.
