   OAKLAND, Calif. -- To the genteel American conservation
movement, Earth First] is a burden and an embarrassment.
   The Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation have
denounced its members as the moral equivalent of outlaws. A
former U.S. interior secretary has described the organizaton
as "a bunch of kooks." By police reckoning it is an extremist
and even violent group whose idea of saving the planet
includes spiking trees to make logging hazardous, and
destroying power lines and road-building equipment.

   But would the group go as far as to plant bombs? The
Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law-enforcement
authorities are expected to offer their views about this
question on Friday, when they give the results of an
investigation of a pipe-bomb explosion that injured two Earth
First] members here last month. The question: Did someone try
to kill them, or are they merely incompetent bomb makers?
   The investigation has put the controversial organization
into the limelight. Earth First] claims to be a kind of
confederacy of perhaps 5,000 "eco-warriors." Its founding was
inspired 10 years ago by the late Edward Abbey's novel "The
Monkey Wrench Gang." The 1975 book romanticized
environmentalists who fictionally liberated the deserts by
destroying billboards, roads and bulldozers while plotting to
free the Colorado River by blowing up the Glen Canyon Dam. In
1981, Earth First] draped a 300-foot banner, painted to
resemble a crack, over the dam. The authorities weren't
amused.
   In 1983, Dave Foreman, an Earth First] founder, lay on a
logging road in Oregon and wouldn't yield to a pickup driven
by a lumberjack. The driver kept going, and dragged Mr.
Foreman, clutching the pickup's front bumper, for a hundred
yards. Within the past year, Earth Firsters have chained
themselves to road-building machinery in Arizona to block a
telescope project that endangers a rare mountain squirrel,
created "human blockades" of logging roads in Australia, and
sat for days in the tops of Northern California redwood trees
attempting to keep them from being felled.
   In Arizona, federal authorities last year arrested three
Earth First] activists, charging that they had used cutting
torches to destroy power lines in a field test of a grander
scheme aimed at disabling nuclear power plants in Arizona and
California. Mr. Foreman, though he wasn't arrested at the
scene, was charged with conspiracy for allegedly helping plan
the scheme. All have denied the charges and rejected
government offers to plea-bargain.
   Earth First] insists that it is peaceful. "We believe in
confrontation, yes, but violence, no," says Mike Roselle, a
founder. He says Earth First] people are the targets, not the
instigators, of violence.
   Indeed, the car bombing on May 24 injured two Earth First]
leaders -- Judi Bari, a 40-year-old mother of two, and Darryl
Cherney, a 33-year-old musician. They were driving through a
quiet Oakland neighborhood when a pipe bomb in the backseat
of Ms. Bari's Subaru exploded.
   She was seriously injured; Mr. Cherney suffered a gash
over the eye. Oakland police, however, whisked the two into
custody -- Ms. Bari to the hospital, where she is recovering,
Mr. Cherney into jail -- on suspicion of transporting the
bomb for some terrorist purpose. After a flurry of statements
indicating the two would quickly be charged, police backed
down and asked for more time. Mr. Cherney was released from
jail.
   The activists insist they were targeted for death, perhaps
by greedy timber or other commercial interests, or by
right-wing off-road-vehicle ideologues angry over Earth
First] efforts to keep vehicles out of Western deserts. They
say that in recent months they have received at least 50
death threats.
   On Friday, the FBI and other authorities are scheduled to
put up or shut up. They are to announce the results of their
investigation, dealing among other things with whether the
pair was involved in the bombing of a Cloverdale, Calif.,
sawmill in early May.
   The evidence already disclosed in the Oakland car bombing
seems circumstancial, if damaging: The bomb appears to have
been lying unconcealed on the car seat when it exploded, for
example, and nails used to assemble it seem similar to nails
found elsewhere in the car.
   "Ridiculous]" Mr. Cherney says of the authorities'
suspicions. "We were a band on the way to a gig." A former
English teacher in Brooklyn as well as a musician, he manages
a grim joke: "We now call ourselves the Exploding Subarus."
But he adds in deadly seriousness: "Somebody tried to kill
us."
   Their friends and supporters shudder to think otherwise.
"If they {Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari} did this, it's all over,"
says a friend of Ms. Bari. "It will be devastating to the
cause."
   Many of the death threats appear related to Earth First]
efforts to organize a summer-long demonstration against
Northern California timber companies that are clear-cutting
the last of the state's privately owned virgin redwood
forests. The protest has stirred deep hostility in the
redwood corridors of Mendocino and Humboldt Counties. The two
activists have said that when the bomb exploded they were
headed for a musical fund-raiser -- he is a vocalist and
guitarist, she a fiddler -- for their "Redwood Summer"
project.
   With help from another militant environmental group,
Greenpeace, Earth First] has hired a detective to investigate
the bombing. Earth First] has a list of suspects, including
disgruntled loggers and the police themselves. Another is the
"Committee for the Death of Earth First," which is the
signature on recent anonymous letters threatening to "hunt
down" Earth First] women.
   The FBI still considers Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari as
suspects. But, says Duke Diedrich, a spokesman for the bureau
in San Francisco, "We haven't ruled out any possibility and
our investigation is very widespread."
   Earth First] has no faith in the bureau. Mr. Foreman has
obtained FBI wiretap transcripts in which an undercover agent
is heard telling other agents that the real importance of
arresting Mr. Foreman is "to send a message" to militant
environmentalists, adding, "That's all we're really doing."
Later, realizing his microphone is still on, the agent says,
"We don't need that on tape. Hoo boy]"
   While the FBI denies trying to unfairly discredit Earth
First], Mr. Foreman's lawyer, Garry Spence (who also
represents Imelda Marcos in her federal racketeering trial)
promises to make the agent's "message" the central issue in
Mr. Foreman's trial on charges of destroying power lines,
scheduled for September.
   Friends of Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari say they can't believe
that either is capable of building or exploding a bomb.
   Mr. Cherney says his childhood friends know he was
something of a "chicken," deathly afraid of firecrackers.
Friends describe Ms. Bari, who couldn't be interviewed in the
hospital for this story, as a union organizer and
"hell-raiser," but one with a self-deprecating sense of humor
whose credo is nonviolence. Oakland police have produced a
photograph of her with a submachine gun, but Mr. Cherney says
it was taken as a prank for the cover of a satirical record
album she and he recorded some time ago. It was titled, "They
Don't Make Hippies Like They Used To."
   Mr. Cherney says Earth First] often lands in trouble
because it uses hyperbole and satire as a weapon and a
catharsis. To write of pouring sand in the gasoline tank of a
bulldozer, he says, isn't the same as doing it -- even though
it still pleases the writer and offends the authorities, he
says.
   Some think this philosophy explains statements by Ms.
Bari, who last March joined other Earth First] members in
Ukiah, Calif., in slipping past crowds to hang a sign on a
huge mechanical logger that read: "This Thing Kills Jobs and
Forests." A few weeks later, the machine was destroyed by a
mysterious fire. Ms. Bari told the Earth First] Journal, the
organization's newsletter: "Either this thing is a $700,000
lemon, or there are some heroic people out there in the
woods."
   Did Ms. Bari have anything to do with the fire? "It wasn't
me," she said. "I was home in bed with five witnesses."
