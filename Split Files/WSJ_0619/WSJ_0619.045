   TORONTO -- "We've never had any cash," says Corona Corp.'s
Ned Goodman. "When you get into a situation where your
opposition is dealing with cash, you've got to become more
creative."
   Creative financing is the Corona chairman's hallmark.
Mainly by issuing new securities and trading them for assets,
he has built Toronto-based Corona into one of North America's
10 biggest gold mining companies. Through a special class of
shares, he and a few friends have solid control with only
7.6% of the equity. His penchant for complex deals and
ultimate control has given rise to what analysts call the
"Ned Factor," a sort of bewilderment discount that they say
sometimes affects the share prices of his companies.

   Despite this, Corona shareholders have done better over
the years than those of most other Canadian gold companies.
   Now Mr. Goodman, 52 years old, has proposed a typically
complex series of transactions, entirely paid for with paper,
that could win Corona control of two companies that own
Canada's hottest new gold property. The Eskay Creek property
in British Columbia has estimated reserves of 4.8 million
ounces, worth about US$1.66 billion at current prices.
   But Corona, and Mr. Goodman's paper-shuffling style, are
challenged by a 230 million Canadian dollar (US$196 million),
all-cash offer by Placer Dome Inc. for one of the target
companies, Stikine Resources Ltd. Most analysts agree that
Mr. Goodman's paper probably has more long-term value than
Placer Dome's cash, and Corona also has locked up a huge
block of shares in Stikine. But recent declines in the price
of gold, along with the Ned Factor, have pushed down the
price of Corona's shares and, therefore, the value of its
planned offer. The contest won't be over until Vancouver,
British Columbia-based Placer Dome's bid expires today.
   Mr. Goodman's style has deep roots. Born in Montreal, he
was trained as a geologist and later moved into investment
counseling. He became involved with a sleepy copper producer
called Campbell Chibougamau Mines Ltd. After a 1979 proxy
fight, Mr. Goodman took over as chairman and went on a
shopping binge in the resource sector.
   By 1985, Campbell had run up lots of debt, and Mr. Goodman
was outnumbered when the board decided to sell the company's
interest in Royex Gold Mining Corp. He quit the Campbell
board and bought the Royex stake in a transaction that even
Mr. Goodman says was complex.
   "I said that I'd never put myself in a position again of
working for a company where someone else is going to make the
decisions," Mr. Goodman says.
   Royex's main asset was its holding in International Corona
Resources Ltd., which in turn held a controlling stake in
Royex. Over the next three years, Royex acquired major
interests in other resource outfits, financing the deals in
part by transferring investments between units.
   "We were getting an awful lot of criticism because we had
a complicated company. I didn't like it either. (But) we had
no choice," Mr. Goodman says. To simplify matters, he merged
Royex with four related companies to form Corona in 1988.
   In his latest proposal, Mr. Goodman plans to spin off
Corona's gold assets into a separately listed company. Some
shares of the new company, to be called Corona Gold Corp.,
will be distributed to current Corona holders. He also has
offered a combination of Corona and Corona Gold shares to the
owners of Eskay Creek, Stikine and Prime Resources Group
Inc., which would then be merged with Corona Gold.
   Mr. Goodman says the Corona restructuring, which would
leave the parent holding a mixed basket of resource
interests, is meant to still the "moans and groans" of
holders who disapproved of the company's branching out from
precious metals.
   But the restructuring plan hasn't satisfied all of Mr.
Goodman's critics, who complain that he freely spends
Corona's Class A shares, which carry one vote apiece, while
leaving intact the number of Class B shares, which have 100
votes apiece and are largely held by Mr. Goodman and four
other directors.
   A study of Corona's past share price performance indicates
that backing Mr. Goodman has been wise. Barry Allan, an
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.,
calculates that an investor buying a Royex share in January
1987, when Mr. Goodman became Royex's chairman, would have
seen a 3.4% appreciation in his money. This compares with a
9.9% drop in the Toronto Stock Exchange gold index over the
same period and a decline of 15% in the price of gold
bullion.
   Nevertheless, "there are a lot of people who don't want to
have anything to do with the guy (Mr. Goodman). I sometimes
wonder whether people are afraid of him because he's two
steps ahead of them," says John Embry, a vice president of
Toronto-based Royal Bank Investment Management, which holds
about 4% of the Corona Class A shares.
   Although he backs Mr. Goodman's proposals to acquire Eskay
Creek and restructure Corona, Mr. Embry says he remains
concerned Corona will continue to control the new gold unit
with a 50.2% holding.
   Mr. Goodman plans to remain at the helm of the Corona
parent, which will concentrate on building up its interests
in base metals, oil and gas, industrial minerals and
financial services. Meantime, Corona Gold, if it succeeds in
its plan to merge with the current owners of Eskay Creek,
will focus on developing that ore body. Mr. Goodman estimates
the addition of Eskay Creek would boost Corona's production
to about 1.2 million ounces of gold in 1994 from 700,000
ounces expected this year.
