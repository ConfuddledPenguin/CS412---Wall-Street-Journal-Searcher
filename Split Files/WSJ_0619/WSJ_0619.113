   Canam Manac Inc. and two Quebec government agencies
offered 15.25 Canadian dollars a share ($13.02) or about
C$220 million (US$188 million) for the 27% of Noverco Inc.
they don't already own.
   Canam Manac and the two agencies announced in April their
intention of making the offer. Regulatory approval of the bid
was granted last week. The tender offer expires July 17.
Noverco, based in Montreal, controls Quebec's dominant
natural gas distributor.

   Canam Manac and the two agencies said they transferred
their combined 73% stake in Noverco to a new concern that is
making the tender offer. The new concern is 50%-owned by
Canam Manac, a St. Georges, Quebec, steel concern. Caisse de
Depot et Placement, the Quebec government's pension-fund
agency, holds 25%, as does Soquip, the government's energy
agency.
   In Montreal Exchange trading yesterday, Noverco shares
closed at C$15, up 12.5 Canadian cents.
