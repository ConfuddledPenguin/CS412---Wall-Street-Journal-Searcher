   NCNB Corp., in a move to bolster its mortgage-service
operations, said it agreed to acquire a large portfolio from
Dallas-based Fundamental Mortgage Corp., a unit of San
Jacinto Savings Association, Houston. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The agreement calls for NCNB, a banking company based in
Charlotte, N.C., to purchase Fundamental's mortgage-servicing
agreements with a principal balance outstanding of as much as
$10.4 billion, as well as Fundamental's loan-servicing
facility in Louisville, Ky., with about 300 employees.

   NCNB said the proposed purchase would triple the size of
its NCNB Mortgage Corp., which now manages $4.8 billion in
mortgage-servicing agreements. The agreement, which is
subject to due diligence by both companies and approvals by
directors of the companies and regulators, is expected to be
completed by the end of the third quarter.
