   MCLEAN, Va. -- GTE Spacenet and a Mexican
telecommunications firm agreed to jointly provide data, voice
and broadcast communications services via satellite between
the U.S. and Mexico.
   The services are separate from those provided by
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or
Intelsat, a satellite-services provider owned by about 119
countries, excluding the Soviet Union and its allies.

   GTE Spacenet said, however, that Intelsat has approved
this new agreement, signed with Telecomunicaciones de Mexico.
GTE Spacenet is a unit of GTE Corp., the Stamford, Conn.,
telecommunications, lighting and precision-materials company.
   The operation with the Mexican firm will allow a company
with a private communications network to extend the network
into Mexico, allowing the company to send messages directly
from office to office, said Raymond Marks, GTE Spacenet's
vice president of marketing and business development. In
contrast, Intelsat transmits a company's messages to a
Mexican Intelsat station, which then transmits the message to
the company's local office.
   Additionally, Mr. Marks said that Intelsat hasn't been
able to provide uniform levels of service for all regions of
both countries.
   The new service doesn't directly compete with Intelsat,
which largely routes public transmissions, such as consumer
phone calls and network TV.
