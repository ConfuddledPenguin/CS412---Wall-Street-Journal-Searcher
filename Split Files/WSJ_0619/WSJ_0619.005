   STOCKHOLM -- The deficit on Sweden's current account
narrowed to 1.5 billion kronor ($246.45 million) in April
from a deficit of 2.7 billion kronor a year earlier, the
Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said.
   The gap on the current account, which includes traded
items, services and transfers, was markedly lower than the
3.3 billion-krona deficit in March, the bank said, citing
chiefly better trade figures.
