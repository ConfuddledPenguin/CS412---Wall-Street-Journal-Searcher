   Profit after taxes and minority interests and before
extraordinary items rose 23% to #222.2 million from #181

25.5 pence. Profit attributable to shareholders, after taxes
and special items, fell 2.3% to #224.3 million from #231.8
million; the latest year included a #2.1 million special

   Sales increased 21% to #2.7 billion from #2.2 billion.
   BET, noting the results show its stability, said that
support services in the construction industry focus on the
heavy and highly specialized end of that business and helped
BET combat the overall downturn in British building, and that
its other services, including waste removal, office cleaning
and distribution, depend mostly on long-term contracts,
providing resilience.
