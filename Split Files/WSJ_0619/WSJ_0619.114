   Some stock-market investors just love bad news.
   There's nothing they like better than a chance to grab up
stock in a promising company after some piece of bad news has
hammered the price down to what they consider a bargain
level.

   And the current volatile market is giving them plenty of
opportunities. "In this `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' market,
everyone is poised with their finger on the sell button,"
says Kurt Brouwer, partner in Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San
Francisco investment-management firm.
   But making money in the stock market by buying on bad news
takes keen analysis and access to information. Most
professionals don't think it's a good approach for
individuals.
   "It's a very dangerous game for small investors, because
you must know the stock and the company extremely well," says
Alan Westin, president of Westin Capital Corp., a Los Angeles
investment firm.
   The idea is to buy "on a discrete, one-time-only bad piece
of news instead of the first indication of a long-term
illness," says John Markese, research director of the
American Association of Individual Investors. "It's hard to
tell the difference, and the approach of automatically buying
on the bad news has gotten a lot of people into trouble."
   Still, when used with care, the bad-news strategy has been
successful for many investors. "If you stick with industry
leaders that have achieved strong growth records in the past
and have run into a temporary problem, you can do well," says
Jim Collins, chairman of Insight Capital Management, a
Moraga, Calif., money manager that specializes in growth
stocks.
   The secret, says Mr. Brouwer, is lots of homework. "You
must study the company, look at the annual reports and check
the consistency of their earnings," he says. "If you're
looking to do this with a computer software company, go to a
software store and find out what they think of the products."
   Peggy Schmeltz, a Bowling Green, Ohio, investor, does this
kind of in-depth homework. "I keep a card file on 200 good
growth stocks, and I record all their prices and
price-earnings ratios," she says. "Whenever I see a price
drop, I look into how far it dropped and why." If the market
has overreacted, she'll buy.
   Among her successes: Union Carbide Corp., which she bought
in July 1985, a little over six months after the poison-gas
disaster at its subsidiary's plant in Bhopal, India. Concerns
about the company's liability drove the stock down sharply.
Mrs. Schmeltz says she bought it at $45 and sold in December
of that year at $70.
   Buying on the bad news is a different game from buying a
turnaround situation when a company is on the verge of going
into bankruptcy court. Many investors reaped huge profits
after buying Chrysler Corp. in the early 1980s when the auto
maker was seeking a loan guarantee from the government. Under
Lee Iacocca, Chrysler recovered in the following months, and
some investors made gains of as much as 400% on their stock
purchases.
   That's a much tougher call than buying on the bad news.
The bad-news strategy "doesn't target companies whose
viability is in doubt," says David Dreman, president of
Dreman Value Management, New York, who uses the bad-news
approach in his strategy of buying undervalued stocks.
   "We don't buy companies with too much debt," he says.
"This isn't a play on whether the company will survive a
financial crisis. We buy good companies with solid long-term
prospects who have temporary bad news."
   Two recent examples show how bad-news plays can lead to
profits.
   Consider Oracle Systems Corp., a maker of data base
management software. With a compound annual profit growth
rate of 121% a year from 1985 to 1989, the company was a
darling of Wall Street, with a stock price above $25 a share.
   Then, on March 27, the company reported flat fiscal
third-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share, seven cents below
what analysts had been expecting. Officials said the
lackluster earnings were an anomaly, blaming them on an
internal foul-up that put $15 million of software contracts
into the fourth quarter instead of the third.
   On March 28, Oracle's stock plunged to $17.375 a share --
a one-day loss of 31% on volume of 21 million shares, the
highest single-day volume ever for an over-the-counter stock.
Some analysts told their clients to sell because they were
concerned about Oracle's earnings growth rate and its control
of operations.
   Mr. Collins of Insight Capital says he went in the next
day, buying some shares at $18. Over the next four weeks, he
bought more shares at prices ranging from $14.75 to $19 each.
"Oracle is a leader in its field, and the consensus of the
pros was that they expected its earnings growth rate to be
30% to 40% a year for 1990 and 1991," Mr. Collins says. "When
you find a leader hit hard, you have a good play." Oracle
Systems has since recovered to $22.50.
   Nordstrom Inc., a Seattle-based retail department store
chain in the midst of a national expansion, is another Wall
Street favorite that took a recent hit. Because of a long
record of strong earnings and sales growth, the stock opened
the year at $38.75. But in late April, a spate of news about
the company's battle with a union and inventory problems
drove the stock down to $27.
   Abbott Keller, investment strategist for Concord
Management Co., a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm,
says concerns over the company's labor problems were
"overstated." In addition, he says, a first-quarter earnings
report that showed a 42% decline in per-share earnings wasn't
indicative of a slowing of the company's growth rate. "With
any retail chain, you don't know about the year until the
fourth quarter," he says. "People make a big deal out of the
first- and second-quarter earnings, but they don't count
much."
   Nordstrom stock has since rebounded to $34.25.
   But the bad-news strategy can backfire if the bad news
turns out to be the first of many negatives for a company.
Such was the case, says Mr. Westin, with First Executive
Corp., a Los Angeles insurance holding company with a large
junk bond portfolio. A year ago, the company's stock was
selling for $16 a share. But by last September, problems in
the junk bond market had driven the price down to $10.
   "We were told by some analysts that all the bad news was
out, and that even if the company marked down the junk bond
portfolio by 50%, the stock was still selling below its book
value," says Mr. Westin. "But I wasn't willing to bet this
was a one-time thing."
   More bad news came later. First Executive announced a
year-end charge of $515 million for bond defaults and
projected a "substantial loss" for 1989. Later, the
fourth-quarter loss alone totaled $835 million. In May, First
Executive said it paid out $1.33 billion in the first quarter
to holders surrendering insurance policies and annuities. The
stock closed yesterday at $2.5625 a share.
