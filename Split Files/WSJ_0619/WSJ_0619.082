   CINCINNATI -- Great American Communications Co. said it

   The company said it will pay a net cash price of $825 for
each $1,000 principal amount of notes acquired. In privately
negotiated transactions, Great American said it will acquire
approximately $88.6 million principal amount of the $174
million of reset notes outstanding.

in the next several days for the remaining $85.4 million
principal amount of reset notes.
   The company said the purchase is subject to completion of
financing but said it has received loan commitments from a
group of banks.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is advising Great American on
the offer and will serve as its dealer manager.
