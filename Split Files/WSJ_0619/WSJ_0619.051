   LONDON -- African nations should concentrate on production
of commodities rather than industrialize, a United Nations
study said.
   Reversing previous policy recommendations that advised
stricken African countries to reduce their dependence on
commodities, the report said it would cost billions of
dollars and be "extremely difficult" for the countries to
diversify into manufacturing.

   "We studied the problem for a year, and despite world
commodity price trends there just isn't any alternative,"
said Malcolm Fraser, a former Australian prime minister who
chaired the UN Secretary-General's Expert Group on African
Commodities.
   The study said African nations "must use commodity
production and trade as a motor for expansion." Commodity
production and distribution should be privatized or
decentralized, it said, adding that local and foreign
investment would improve transport, storage, agricultural
research and education facilities.
   Producers would help counter commodity gluts by allowing
local prices to fluctuate in line with international quotes
and by cooperating with other African nations and consumers,
the report said. Meanwhile, the U.S. and European countries
should reduce barriers to African produce, Mr. Fraser added.
   Africa's population will grow to about 740 million in 10
years from 550 million at present, the report said. Yet debts
have surged to about $220 billion from $108 billion in 1980
and economic growth has fallen. Africa is more dependent on
commodities as export income than any other region, the
report said, and raw materials normally account for about 90%
of the total.
   In 1988, commodities earned $18 billion for Africa, the
study said, but adjusted for inflation that was 26% lower
than in 1980 and 35% below 1970. The decline reflects lower
price levels and a much smaller international market share.
