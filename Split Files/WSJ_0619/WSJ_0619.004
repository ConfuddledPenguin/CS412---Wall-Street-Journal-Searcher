   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- Met-Coil Systems Corp. said it sold
certain assets and the rights to its Mark One Corp. unit to a
group including management of the subsidiary. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The maker of metal forming and fabricating machinery said
Mark One, a maker of industrial parts washers and integrated
handling systems, had annual sales of less than 5% of its
total revenue for the year ended May 31. The company hasn't
announced those results yet, but for the previous year,
Met-Coil had sales of $69.6 million.
