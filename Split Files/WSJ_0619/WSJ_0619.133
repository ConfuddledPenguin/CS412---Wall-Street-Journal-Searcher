   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. said it replaced
part of its financing package for its $1.2 billion tender
offer for MGM/UA Communications Co. and is talking with
MGM/UA about another delay in the offer closing.
   Pathe Communication's $20-a-share offer, already delayed
several times, is set to expire Friday. The original offer in
March specified a final deadline of June 23. Pathe wouldn't
say how much of an extension is now under consideration.
MGM/UA officials couldn't be reached for comment.

   Last week, Pathe disclosed that it is raising about $368
million for the offer from a mix of European asset sales and
bank loans. SASEA Holding, a Swiss company of which one of
Pathe's co-chairmen is managing director, had been expected
to raise about $52 million from sales of some or all of its
Banca Agricola Milanese stock. The stock sales weren't
completed, Pathe said.
   Pathe said that SASEA has instead raised about $46 million
from the sale of some or all of its stock in Finarte
Respamio, an Italian finance company. Pathe said the balance
of the $52 million will come from sales of marketable
securities of its parent company, Comfinance S.A. Comfinance
and its European affiliates hold 88% of Pathe's stock.
   Pathe also said that talks are continuing with Time Warner
Inc. concerning Time Warner's agreement to provide $650
million toward the transaction in exchange for certain film
distribution rights and a security interest in the United
Artists film library.
