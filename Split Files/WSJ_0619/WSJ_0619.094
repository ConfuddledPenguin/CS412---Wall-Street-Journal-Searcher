   MORE RESETTLEMENT IN BURMA

   The Burmese government plans to resettle former
insurgents, homeless villagers and destitute people along the
nation's embattled border with Thailand.
   Rangoon radio said $2 million had been earmarked for
resettlement projects in the Karen and Mon border states
during 1990-91. "The government is pushing hard to develop
these areas to reduce their dependency on smuggling as well
as to neutralize the insurgents," said one Western diplomat
in Rangoon.
   People in the resettlement plan came "from insurgent
groups who have surrendered to the authorities after
regretting their mistakes, villagers who have left their
homeland because of threats from insurgents, and destitutes,"
the radio said. They would be given free food and lodging for
two months and up to $1,076 worth of wood, bamboo and thatch
grass to build their own homes.
   Thousands of Burmese have been forcibly resettled to new
towns from densely populated areas of Rangoon and Mandalay.
Diplomats said the resettlements may have been aimed at
breaking up potential centers of anti-government unrest.
                                                                                                       

   FIGHTING MEXICO'S POLLUTION
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that Tokyo would provide
$786 million to help Mexico fight air pollution, foreign
ministry officials said. "Japan's assistance will be great
news for the Mexican public and should impress them greatly,"
Mr. Salinas was quoted as saying. Mr. Salinas is in Tokyo for
talks with government and business leaders. Japan had already
pledged aid for Mexico's anti-pollution projects but had made
no commitment to a specific sum.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S NEW LOAN POLICY
                                                                                                       

   China's central bank will nearly double its planned loan
outlay this year to help pull the economy out of its current
slump, the People's Daily said. The People's Bank of China
will provide 55 billion yuan ($11.65 billion) in credit this
year, up from its original plan of 30 billion yuan, the
official daily newspaper said. Beijing clamped down on credit
in late 1988 as part of an austerity policy aimed at reducing
inflation and cooling off the overheated economy. The
measures succeeded in lowering inflation from about 30% in
early 1989 to about 4% today but also triggered a sharp
decline in economic growth.
                                                                                                       

   HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS IN SWEDEN
                                                                                                       

   Sweden's Social Welfare Board proposed giving homosexuals
living together almost the same rights as married couples.
The board said cohabiting homosexuals should be able to
register their partnerships formally. "We want to show that
homosexual relationships are accepted by society," a board
official said, adding: "We are hoping that this will lead to
long and monogamous relationships and limit AIDS." The
proposal, which could become law by July 1, 1992, wouldn't
give homosexuals living together the right to adopt children,
the board said.
                                                                                                       

   SAUDIS ADVISE LOS ANGELES
                                                                                                       

   Saudi Arabia has sent experts to Los Angeles to advise the
city on water desalination, the Saudi Press Agency SPA
reported. SPA said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was "greatly
impressed" by Saudi Arabia's advanced technology in producing
drinking water from the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea when he
visited a Saudi exhibition now touring the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   HUNGARIAN TOURIST BOOM
                                                                                                       

   Hungary is enjoying a boom in tourists from outside the
East bloc. The state news agency MTI said that 4.2 million
visitors from hard-currency areas had entered Hungary in the
first four months of this year -- 70% more than in the same
period of 1989. In a separate report, MTI predicted a sharp
drop in the number of Hungarian tourists traveling to East
Germany because of the monetary union of the two Germanys set
for July 1.
                                                                                                       

   REPRIMAND IN JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has reprimanded one
of his aides for engaging in stock deals last year.
   The aide, Mitsuo Ando, said, "I was told by Mr. Kaifu,
`Having been my secretary for a long time, surely you know my
feelings {about stock deals}.'" Mr. Ando said he was harshly
reprimanded for the transaction, which was a purchase of
8,000 shares in Meitech, a company that hires out computer
engineers.
   Mr. Ando said the shares cost nearly 30 million yen
($195,000). When Ando bought Meitech shares, the stock was
traded at 3,700 yen per share. Now the shares cost 6,200 yen.
   Members of Mr. Kaifu's cabinet and other high-ranking
parliamentary officials agreed to refrain from dealing in
stocks, real estate and golf-course memberships after a
scandal involving questionable deals in the stock of the
Recruit Co. information-services conglomerate. That
restriction apparently also now applies to top politicians'
aides.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The Nobel Foundation rejected a proposal for the creation
of a Nobel environmental prize. "We fear an inflation of
prizes would seriously diminish the value of those already
existing," said Stig Ramel, the foundation's chairman. . . .
The state-owned Hluhluwe Game Park in South Africa's eastern
Natal Province sold a breeding herd of five endangered black
rhinoceroses to a private conservationist for $846,000,
officials said.
