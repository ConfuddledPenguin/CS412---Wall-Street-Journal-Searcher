   LONDON -- The public sector borrowing requirement, the
most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or
surplus, showed a deficit of #1.7 billion ($2.91 billion) in
May, compared with a deficit of #2.12 billion in April and a
surplus of #890 million a year earlier, the British treasury
said.
   In the first two months of the fiscal year that began
April 1, the deficit totaled #3.8 billion, compared with a
surplus of #700 million a year earlier. The government is
projecting a #7 billion surplus for the year ending March 31.
