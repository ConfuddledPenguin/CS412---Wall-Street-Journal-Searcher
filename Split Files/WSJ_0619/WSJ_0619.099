   The stock of Wendy's International lately has been hotter
than its burgers.
   Shares of the nation's fourth-largest hamburger chain have
surged 48% in heavy trading since the beginning of May. They
closed yesterday at 6 7/8, unchanged, on a day when most
other issues on the New York Stock Exchange declined. Last
Thursday, the stock hit a two-year peak of 7 1/2 as volume
exploded to more than three million shares, outstripping in a
single day Wendy's total volume for the entire month of
February.

   The main spark for the commotion has been a rumor that
PepsiCo wants to buy Wendy's. Both companies have declined to
comment on the rumor, but some knowledgeable people find it
hard to swallow.
   Other factors also are fueling the rise. Profit, which has
been puny for the past three years, is improving under James
W. Near, the company's new chief executive. Shearson Lehman
recently recommended the stock. And more than a dozen
corporate insiders have purchased Wendy's shares this year
(although most of them bought only modest amounts).
   Despite the favorable signs, quite a few money managers
and analysts think that buyers have gorged themselves
excessively on the stock and are headed for a stomachache. At
6 7/8, they point out, Wendy's is selling for 24 times the
past 12 months' earnings from operations.
   That's a rich multiple even for a highly successful
company. Wendy's has been an also-ran in the highly
competitive hamburger wars. In size, it trails McDonald's,
Burger King and Hardee's. In profitability it lags behind
many competitors, with a return on equity of less than 7% in
each of the past three years.
   To be sure, earnings finally are trending up. Some people
forecast profit of as much as 40 cents a share this year, up
from 32 cents last year (seven cents of which reflected an
accounting change and a one-time gain).
   But some analysts look at Wendy's operating results and
ask, in the words of the chain's old slogan: "Where's the
beef?" Much of this year's improvement comes from cutting
back on last year's massive use of discount coupons, says
John Rohs of Wertheim Schroeder. By July or August,
year-over-year comparisons won't any longer show much benefit
from that change, he says.
   Cost-cutting also is playing a big part in this year's
improved results. Though analysts praise Mr. Near for
shrinking expenses adroitly, few view the tactic as one that
can be spun into a long string of sharp earnings gains.
   As for the PepsiCo rumor, it's "ridiculous," says analyst
Caroline Levy of Shearson. (She likes the stock, anyway.)
"Pepsi's strategy is to buy the segment leader," she says.
"If they can't have McDonald's, they'd rather not be there."
   Wendy's stock is simply "going crazy on takeover rumors,"
says Roger Lipton, analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann. "This
happens periodically. Every time {founder} Dave Thomas plays
golf with one of the top guys at PepsiCo, the stock trades
two million shares a day. My own suspicion is that a deal's
unlikely. PepsiCo has said time and time again that their
strategy is to own the No. 1 player in a segment." PepsiCo is
already big in the fast-food business; it controls Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
   A PepsiCo spokesman, while declining to comment on Wendy's
specifically or a hamburger-chain acquisition in general,
said: "We're very comfortable with the businesses we've got."
He added that PepsiCo is in "the enviable position of not
needing to make acquisitions for growth."
   Shearson's Ms. Levy likes Wendy's stock regardless of
takeover possibilities, mostly because she thinks profit
margins will continue to improve. She says Wendy's is
"starting to see the benefits of programs put into place in
the last two to three years," including a 500-person
reduction in headquarters staff and better training programs
to cut employee turnover.
   Michael Esposito, a managing director at BEM Capital in
New York, has been buying the shares and considers them cheap
at 6 to 6 1/2, regardless of any possible takeover. He thinks
Mr. Near, a former franchisee, is "an operations expert" who
is bringing Wendy's back on track after years of
"helter-skelter growth."
   But Ladenburg's Mr. Lipton says he's "neutral to
skeptical." Even granting the optimists their projection of
45 cents a share in earnings for 1991, he says, the stock is
selling for 15 times next year's earnings. For that kind of
money, he says, "You can buy companies that are in control of
their destiny. . . . You can buy the cream of the crop in
this industry."
