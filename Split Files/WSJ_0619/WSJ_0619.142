   In a decision that poses a grave threat to Motorola Inc.
and several U.S. computer makers, a federal judge in Texas
has decided to impose an earlier ruling that ordered Motorola
to stop selling its most successful computer chip.
   The decision harks back to a ruling made in March, in
which a federal district judge in Austin, Texas, ordered
Motorola to stop selling its 68030 chip because it infringed
on patents held by Japan's Hitachi Ltd. The ruling also found
Hitachi in violation of certain Motorola patents. The judge
then issued a stay of the injunction, allowing Motorola and
Hitachi to keep selling their chips.

   The judge yesterday disclosed his intent to lift the stay,
Motorola and Hitachi officials said. The judge hadn't yet
signed the order yesterday but is scheduled to do so today, a
Hitachi official said.
   If enforced, the decision could be disastrous for
Motorola, which would be forced immediately to stop selling
its flagship 68030 microprocessor chip, used in powerful
computers made by such companies as Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. The 68030 chip is the "brains" of many of
Apple's Macintosh machines.
   Motorola officials said in a written statement that it
will file an emergency appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals
to stay the injunction. The ruling "might temporarily prevent
the company from selling its market-leading 68030," the
statement said. Motorola is "confident" that the appeals
court will "promptly stay the lower court's decision, pending
appeal."
   A Hitachi official said that "Hitachi is continuing to
meet {with Motorola} in an effort to reach a negotiated
settlement" with Motorola. "We want to do all we can toward
reaching a settlement," he said.
   Hitachi has little to lose. The giant conglomerate, which
requested the lifting of the stay, won't be hurt much by the
injunction because it sells few of the chips in the U.S. that
were found to be violating Motorola patents. "There will be
very little effect on Hitachi," the Hitachi official said. In
fact, many U.S. chip executives say Hitachi has the upper
hand in any negotiations and may be using the injunction to
get more favorable treatment from Motorola.
   The ruling could also hurt Apple and others that use the
chip, which only Motorola makes. Companies in March said they
had several months' worth of stockpiles of the vital chip,
but some warned Motorola that they would be angered by a
cutoff of supply. An Apple spokesman said the company
couldn't comment on yesterday's news until it had seen a copy
of the formal ruling.
   A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said the company wouldn't be
affected because it has a license to use the Hitachi patent
and to commission chip makers to make semiconductors for
Hewlett-Packard that use the patent.
   The ruling is the latest twist in an 18-month
trans-Pacific patent battle, started by Motorola, in which
Motorola and Hitachi have launched a barrage of suits and
countersuits. The March ruling, in which the judge chided the
companies for not agreeing out of court, backfired against
Motorola, shocked the computer industry and even caused one
user of the chip to guard its stockpiles with extra security
guards.
   Motorola also said yesterday that the U.S. Patent Office
agreed last week to reexamine Hitachi's patent, which
Motorola claims is invalid on the basis of a 1966 patent. The
patent office has found that "a substantial new question
about {the} Hitachi patent has been raised which has a direct
bearing on the outcome of this case," the Motorola statement
said.
