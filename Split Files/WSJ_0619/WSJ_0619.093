   TORONTO -- Rio Algom Ltd. said it acquired an 8% stake in
Uranium Resources Inc. "with a view to the possibility" of
acquiring all of the company.
   Rio Algom, which last year broke off talks to acquire
Dallas-based Uranium Resources for $2.55 a share, said it
bought 2.1 million Uranium Resources shares for $1.50 each,
or a total of about $3.1 million, from Elders Resources
Finance Inc., a New York-based unit of Elders Resources Ltd.
of New Zealand.

   Rio Algom said it also paid Elders Resources $2.5 million,
or 35 cents each, for warrants to acquire an additional 7.1
million Uranium Resources shares. The warrants, if exercised,
would give Rio Algom a fully diluted stake of about 25% in
Uranium Resources. The warrants are exercisable at $1.25 each
until March 1992.
   A Rio Algom spokesman said the company held further
acquisition talks with Uranium Resources management last
month but that these also were unsuccessful. He said Rio
Algom offered a lower price this time of between $1.50 and
$2.55 for each Uranium Resources share.
   Uranium Resources said it considers the value of the
company to be "substantially greater" than what Rio Algom was
offering. "We have elected not to pursue further discussions
with Rio at this time because of the apparently wide
discrepancy in values placed on the company," a company
statement said.
   Rio Algom, which is 52%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain,
said it may seek further meetings with Uranium Resources
management to discuss acquiring the company.
