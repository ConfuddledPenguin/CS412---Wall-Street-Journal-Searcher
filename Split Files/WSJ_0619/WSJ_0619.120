   WASHINGTON -- Museum curators have opened a new front in
the Cold War. An exhibit coming to the Smithsonian's Air and
Space Museum this week will feature a U.S. Pershing II and a
Soviet SS-20 missile side-by-side.
   Deployment of the once nuclear-tipped missiles generated a
great deal of tension in the 1970s and 1980s. Now they are
part of a touring exhibit that will later open at the Central
Armed Forces Museum in Moscow under the banner "Do Veri, No
Pro Veri," which means "Trust, but Verify." (Military teams
from both sides are busy verifying the destruction of 888 of
the missiles under the terms of the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear
Forces treaty.)

   Then there is Checkpoint Charlie, the gate in the Berlin
Wall that was the backdrop for much of the Cold War drama in
the 1960s. It is heading for a West German museum, as plans
are under way to make much of the rest of the wall a mere
memory.
