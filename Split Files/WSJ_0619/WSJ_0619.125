   RENO, Nev. -- Porsche Cars North America Inc. said it is
raising the prices of its 1991 cars, following a recent
rebound in sales. The price increase will be the company's
first in two years.
   The price of the least expensive Porsche will rise 3.5%,
to $43,350 from $41,900 a year ago. The most expensive model,
the new 911 Turbo, will sell for $95,000, compared with
$74,545 for this year's top-of-the-line Porsche models.

   The move by the U.S. unit of Porsche Enterprises Inc.
comes as its sales have rebounded after dropping 69% between
1986 and 1989. Sales of Porsche's luxury sports cars are up
19% for the first five months of this year.
   Separately, the U.S. sales arm of Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG said it will begin selling its entry-level 318is model
later this month at a base price of $21,500. BMW said the car
would be targeted at the growing near-luxury market.
   BMW is trying to break a slump that saw its U.S. sales
fall from a 1986 peak of 96,759 cars to 64,881 in 1989. BMW
sales for the first five months of 1990 were down 10.2%.
   "{The 318is} will certainly bring us buyers who weren't in
our market range, but it's not in direct response to
competition," said a BMW spokesman. He said the auto maker
expects to sell 7,000 of the model this year.
