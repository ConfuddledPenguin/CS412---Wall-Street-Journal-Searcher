   KHARTOUM, Sudan -- The U.S.-based oil exploration company
Sun Oil Cos. has pulled out of Sudan, but other international
companies want to obtain its concessions, the government
said.
   The official Sudan News Agency quoted an official of the
Energy and Mining Ministry that the Sun Co. unit ceased its
activities in Sudan because of financial difficulties.

   Sun Oil's exploration activities were in parts of Sudan
outside the southern civil war zone, where such operations
were suspended after hostilities broke out in 1983.
   Abdel-Moneim Khogali, energy and mines minister, told SNA
that Sun Oil began tapering off in December, paring its
concession areas by 60%.
   Sun Oil's pullout leaves Sudan's oil prospects in the
hands of U.S.-based Chevron Corp. and France's
Total-Compagnie Francaise des Petroles.
