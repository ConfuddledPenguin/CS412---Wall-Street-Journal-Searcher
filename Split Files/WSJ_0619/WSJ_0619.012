   SAN FRANCISCO -- In the government's latest public service
announcement about AIDS, a young man and woman exchange
feverish kisses on a sofa until a television announcer
suddenly interrupts them.
   The announcer declares that even a healthy-looking person
can be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
The young woman hits the remote control button to silence the
intruder. But the set keeps turning on until they're
thoroughly turned off. "The person you're with right now
could have HIV. . . . Talk to your partner," the announcer
concludes.

   That TV spot is one of a half-dozen created by WPP Group
PLC's Ogilvy &amp; Mather unit for the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control in a new phase of the federal TV campaign. The thrust
of the spots is to familiarize all Americans with the term
HIV -- the formal name of the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome -- and to prompt viewers to do
their own AIDS personal risk assessment.
   The ads, while pointed in their message of AIDS risk, are
solidly mainstream in tone. No needles are shown and not a
hint of gay eroticism sways their firm Middle American
stance. This orientation, a source of criticism from gay
activists in the past, is designed to make them palatable to
the networks in prime-time slots.
   "Television executives are in business to make money,"
says Gary Noble, assistant surgeon general and head of CDC's
AIDS Program. He spoke at a news preview co-sponsored by the
American Medical Association before the start of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS.
   "We want to get all Americans to think about risk in their
lives, whether they've ever shared a needle or had sex with
someone at risk, or whether their partners ever have done
so," Dr. Noble says.
   The commercial, nicknamed "Sofa," isn't limited to one
ethnic group. It's available in both English and Spanish
versions, and it stars dark-haired actors with looks that
make the visual crossover from white to Hispanic. Black faces
are much in evidence throughout other spots.
   In a spot entitled "HIV Positives," the camera ranges
across a number of sound bites of people of all ages and
colors saying: "It's not going to happen to me." Then real
people infected with HIV, not actors, talk about themselves.
Christina, a girl on a beach, says, "I was really shocked
when I found out." A black woman says, "I got it from my
husband. I didn't know he used drugs." The speakers are
ordinary folks with whom the greatest possible number of
viewers can identify. The spot ends by admonishing, "If you
think you're tired of hearing about it, listen to some people
who are really sick of it."
   "We're trying to get their attention, but fear isn't the
goal," Dr. Noble says. Test audiences reacted negatively to
spots that were too frightening or accusatory.
   CDC plans to purchase air time in two pilot cities this
month, and follow the campaign with questionnaires, Dr. Nobel
adds. So far, he says, test audiences in Memphis, Tenn., and
Springfield, Ill., demonstrated 70% recall of the content of
the announcements. But knowledge isn't enough, he concedes.
"You have to change attitudes."
   Because the average incubation period from infection to
AIDS diagnosis is 10 years, there's also a spot designed to
tell men at risk that "testing positive isn't immediately the
end of the world," Dr. Noble says. Presumably appealing to
gays and other single men, a young mustached man named Gary
recalls his anxiety at being tested. Armed with the knowledge
that he's positive, he says, he's taking care of himself and
planning a return to school. "Life seems more important now,"
he says. But there's no male "significant other" in sight.
Thus, it's unclear how much the principal risk group will
respond to such a pitch.
   Dr. Noble said the $1.8 million campaign is scheduled to
begin airing by 8,500 network affiliate stations in mid-July.
