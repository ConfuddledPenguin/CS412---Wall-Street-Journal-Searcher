   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund said Namibia
has applied for membership in the IMF.
   The southwest African country, which is an important
producer of diamonds, also has applied for membership in the
World Bank, according to officials of that international
agency.

   The IMF and the World Bank, each of which currently has
152 member nations, also are considering requests for
membership from Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. The
applications may be formally approved this year.
   The IMF is expected to send a mission to Namibia soon to
help determine what should be the size of its contribution to
the IMF as a member.
