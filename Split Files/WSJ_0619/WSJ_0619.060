   Finance Firms Furnish
   Bigger Share of Loans

   AS REGULATORS pressure banks to retreat from deals loaded
with debt, small business is relying on less-regulated
business-finance firms for a growing share of borrowings.
   Financing from these outfits is costlier and sometimes
more conservative than before. But as Jon Melzer, managing
director of Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc., a New York investment
bank, says, "In some cases, it's going to be the only game in
town."
   Finance companies, such as General Electric Capital Corp.,
have always been a major source of funding for smaller deals.
Now, they are supplying not only unsecured, subordinated
loans but also more of the senior loans that typically were
provided by banks.
   In March, for instance, Westinghouse Credit Corp. provided
$20 million in senior and subordinated loans, plus $6 million
in working capital, for a management buy-out of Allied Steel
&amp; Tractor Products Inc. in Ohio.
   However, with competition falling, finance companies are
charging higher fees and interest than banks -- 25 to 50
basis points more on some senior loans -- or demanding larger
equity stakes in the deals that they fund.
   The finance companies say they are finding themselves with
almost as much business as they can handle, thus they also
are rejecting the riskier deals. That means requiring
borrowers to put up more equity before giving them loans and
steering clear of transactions where borrowers must sell
assets to service debt.
   "Clearly, the banks have backed off and that has opened
the market for those of us that aren't as rigorously
regulated," says Michael Litwin at Fuji Bank Ltd.'s Heller
Financial Inc. unit in Chicago. But "we only do deals we
think make economic sense."

   Copter Operators to Lose
   Some Lucrative Work
                                                                                                       

   HELICOPTER operators in California say the state is about
to become one of their biggest competitors.
   For years, a handful of helicopter operators have helped
the state fight forest fires, with some getting nearly $1
million a year from it. But the California Department of
Forests and Fire Protection is planning to acquire 20
Vietnam-vintage Army helicopters to do the job itself.
   Art Trask, manager of the department's helicopter program,
says the plan will save money, even when he includes the
$575,000 he expects it will cost to refurbish each aircraft.
He also says the state's safety record is better than that of
private contractors.
   The state has used old military choppers to fight fires
since 1981. The plan would nearly double its helicopter fleet
and, private operators claim, completely displace them. Steve
Sullivan says his San Jose firm in 1981 lost two of three
state firefighting contracts, which once accounted for half
of Aris Helicopter's annual revenue. "We survived," he says,
"but it was a pretty severe blow."
   The copter operators say California's plan contradicts
federal policy that discourages government competition with
the private sector. And the Helicopter Association
International estimates refurbishing the helicopters will run
closer to $850,000 a chopper.
   Says Frank Jensen, the trade group's president: "We
believe the government should govern and the private sector
should provide the products and services."
                                                                                                       

   Solutions to Pollution
   Can Get Owners a Grant
                                                                                                       

   THE U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is putting aside
its stick -- and offering a carrot for ideas on solving
pollution problems.
   The agency's Office of Asbestos and Small Business
Ombudsman promises to award grants of up to $25,000 to
small-business owners submitting the best plans for
developing little-known techniques for preventing pollution
or reducing waste. The agency has $800,000 to hand out. It
has worked with 16 small-business trade groups, which have
offered pointers on making the program work and plan to
promote it among their members.
   Firms have already expressed interest in applying for the
grants. Terry Printing Inc., a Janesville, Wis., printer, is
experimenting with soybean oil as a less-troublesome
substitute for petroleum oil in ink. Rampart Industries Inc.,
a Detroit metal-finishing and electroplating firm, is trying
a process that eliminates the pollutant sodium cyanide as a
catalyst in cadmium plating.
   The deadline for submissions is July 1. Grant recipients
will be announced starting in November.
                                                                                                       

   Video Releases Stretch
   Entrepreneurs' Ad Dollars
                                                                                                       

   SMALL FIRMS are turning to video news releases for
prime-time visibility.
   They are taking a cue from bigger companies, which have
already been using corporate video releases to describe a
product or service. Getting into the act can be even more
beneficial to small firms, which must make tighter ad budgets
go as far as possible.
   The releases, usually 60 to 90 seconds long, resemble news
coverage and are run by some TV stations seeking inexpensive
news and entertainment material.
   Arbitration Forums Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y., used a video
release featuring a client, an accident victim, describing
the benefits of arbitration over litigation. About 225
stations across the U.S. broadcast it, a company spokesman
says. Resulting in over 1,250 queries, the videocast "was one
of the best marketing investments we've made," he says.
   The releases, which usually cost $20,000 to $25,000 to
produce, are going to increase in importance for small
companies, says Michael Friedman of DWJ Associates Inc., a
New York communications firm. "It is the cheapest way to get
TV exposure without paying Super Bowl prices."
