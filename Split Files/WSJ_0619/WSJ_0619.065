   DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said the Midland
Cogeneration Venture, of which it is a 49% owner, completed a
$2.3 billion sale-leaseback transaction involving its
Midland, Mich., power facility and separately formed a
partnership to pursue a potential expansion of the plant.
   CMS said the new partnership, also 49%-owned by a CMS
unit, will pursue a potential expansion of the venture's
Midland, Mich., power plant to supply electricity to the
Midwestern U.S. and Canada. The original Midland Cogeneration
Venture partnership was formed by CMS to salvage a nuclear
power plant that was abandoned by CMS's predecessor company,
Consumers Power Co., and turn it into a gas-fired plant
producing both electricity and steam.

   The new partnership will seek to develop a market for
power that could be generated by the second of two turbine
generators left over from the failed nuclear plant, a CMS
spokesman said.
   CMS said the 25-year sale-leaseback agreement completed
Saturday and involving the first phase of the Midland project
was the largest such transaction ever in the U.S. The deal,
which had been held up by objections from Michigan utility
regulators, gives 65% of the Midland power plant to a
consortium of investors called Deerpath Group and 35% to a
unit of CMS.
   But CMS isn't just a part owner of the plant. It will
continue to hold a 49% interest in the joint venture that
will lease back and operate the plant from the new owners,
the CMS spokesman said.
   CMS valued its proceeds from the transaction at $1.8
billion, including $1.2 billion in notes, rights to another
$300 million in notes that are contingent upon successful
appeals of regulatory decisions and the value of its
ownership and leaseholder stakes in the facility itself.
   CMS is awaiting a decision from a Michigan appeals court
on how it may use proceeds from the Midland transaction.
State regulators contend the company should spend the money
only on the regulated utility operations of its Consumers
Power unit. CMS says it should be free to use the money for
other purposes.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, CMS shares closed at $30.875, down 25 cents.
