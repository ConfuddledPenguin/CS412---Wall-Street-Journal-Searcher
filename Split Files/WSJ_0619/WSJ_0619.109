   "Six Degrees of Separation" (Lincoln Center Theater) is
based on an actual hoax played on several affluent families
in New York City some years ago. In each case, a distraught
young man showed up at the door one evening, claiming he was
a friend of the families' conveniently absent children. Also,
he was the son of Sidney Poitier and had just been mugged.
The good Samaritans took him in for the night, only to find
out later that it was they who had been taken in -- their
children had never heard of him.
   Using this odd incident as a starting point, John Guare
has fashioned a sage and moving comedy about class, privacy,
homosexuality, racism and conflicts between parents and
children. Not only is it enormous fun, its intellectual
pleasures are dazzling, with imagery that bounces
effortlessly from pop culture to erudition, "Cats" to
"Catcher in the Rye," Kandinsky to the Sistine Chapel.

   As the houseguest Paul, James McDaniel is exuberant and
engaging. He's the type of man who usually preys on women,
adapting his charm to suit his particular quarry. He's a
seducer, but his aim is to give happiness; he is oblivious to
the pain he inflicts. Anthony Trollope would have called him
a bounder. Paul doesn't rob or molest his hosts; on the
contrary, he's out to please them. He cooks dinner, regales
them with celebrity stories about his "father," and leads
them in an erudite discussion on the power of the
imagination. As he later says to one woman who let him into
her home, "You let me use all the parts of myself that
night."
   Stockard Channing gives a luminous performance as Ouisa,
one of Paul's hostesses. There's an appealing touch of
self-mockery about her. She's a refined upper-class WASP who
doesn't take herself, her ambitious art-dealer husband or her
bratty Ivy League children too seriously. When someone says
something too earnest, she'll roll her eyes, give a little
moue and crack a joke. She despairs that she and her friends
have turned Paul into "an anecdote to dine out on or dine in
on" and is obsessed with finding out what became of him --
and in doing so, taps into her long-dormant imaginative life.
There's more than a touch of the do-gooder about her, but
that is complicated by her motherly feelings toward Paul and
even by a hint of sexual attraction.
   While the basic shape of "Six Degrees of Separation" is
that of a fast-paced drawing-room comedy, with witticisms
flying, there are occasional shifts to more somber tones that
are mostly successful. (The biggest exception is a suicide
that Paul inspires.)
   The title of the play comes from someone's theory that
every person is linked to every other person by a chain of
just six people. The point? The world's Pauls and Ouisas will
find it worth the effort to follow the chain to one another.
Corny as this may sound, there's not a kernel of corn in
evidence here. This inspiring and uplifting play is one of
the sweetest successes of recent years.
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, one of Broadway's more notable
failures is being revived by the American Musical Theater
Festival at the Walnut Street Theatre. The 1948 show "Love
Life" didn't produce any tunes folks sing in the shower or in
a drive cross-country. So why revive it? The main reason is
that it's a historical curiosity: the only collaboration
between Kurt Weill and Alan Jay Lerner.
   Weill's music may have been more sophisticated in
"Threepenny Opera" and Lerner's lyrics sassier in "My Fair
Lady" and "Gigi," but the 20 numbers here are by no means
trivial. One, "Here I'll Stay," is absolutely lovely -- a
lyrical celebration of the pleasures of home. Another, "I
Remember It Well," is an early version of the wickedly funny
song of the same title that Lerner re-did for "Gigi" (with
more singable music by Frederick Loewe). There are a couple
of big bluesy numbers that Weill derived from the pop music
of the day.
   "Love Life" is interesting historically, too, in that it's
the progenitor of the "concept" musical, later exemplified by
"Cabaret" and "Chorus Line" and seen on Broadway today in
Tommy Tune's "Grand Hotel -- The Musical." In "Love Life," a
skimpy plot alternates with flamboyant vaudeville
song-and-dance numbers that more or less pick up on what's
happening in the story. This approach was so new to audiences
of the day that Lerner and Weill wrote an article in the New
York Times trying to explain what their show was all about.
It should be remembered that the musical that won the Tony
that season was Cole Porter's witty "Kiss Me Kate," with a
storyline stolen from the master plotter of "Taming of the
Shrew -- The Play."
   In the Lerner-Weill context, the last happy couple in
American history must have been George and Martha Washington.
"Love Life's" "plot" tracks the unhappy marriage of a generic
American husband and wife, Susan and Samuel Cooper, from 1792
to 1948. Starting with the pernicious Industrial Revolution,
which lured Dad away from his home workshop and to the
factory, men have been hell-bent on making money. By the time
the Gilded Age comes along, women are contaminated too and
demand their share of time away from home. After the Second
World War, Mom finally gets her chance at earning some filthy
lucre, and the invention of the television creates the first
strain of couch potatoes. Divorce results.
   Richard Muenz and Debbie Shapiro, as the Coopers, are
accomplished musical-comedy performers with lusty, richly
modulated voices. Ms. Shapiro won a Tony last year for her
performance in "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" and Mr. Muenz is
fresh from a charming role in the off-Broadway hit "Closer
Than Ever." The third lead, Neal Ben-Ari, lacks pizzazz as
the emcee, a soulful precursor of "Cabaret's" master of
ceremonies.
   Before the final curtain falls, the Coopers effect a wary
reconciliation. But since late 20th-century audiences know
about the battle of the sexes awaiting Sam and Sue in the
1960s it's hard to consider this a happy ending.
   In New York, the battle of the sexes, '80s-style, is on
view in a slight off-Broadway comedy, "Elliott Loves"
(Promenade Theater). It was written by Jules Feiffer and
directed by Mike Nichols -- who last teamed up in the film
"Carnal Knowledge."
   The play has a promising opening. Elliott (Anthony Heald),
a middle-aged nervous lover, delivers a wistful, funny
monologue about the woman he's recently fallen for. One
minute he has "the desire to run away from her, and the next
minute the desire to be with her for the rest of my life."
Speaking of sex, he says: "You take the forbidden aspect out
. . . and it's as erotic as golf."
   Elliott introduces his girlfriend (Christine Baranski) to
his high school buddies, who haven't advanced emotionally
beyond their prom days. The boys now are in their 40s and all
have girl trouble, which they prattle on about while Elliott
sulks in the corner. One's a divorced alcoholic. Another,
also divorced, once got so angry at his then-wife that he
drove her BMW over a cliff. The third, still tenuously
married, still finds pornography as gripping as he did in
high school.
   As for the girlfriend, her character is a hopeless
mishmash. She starts off as a hilarious neurotic (which Ms.
Baranski plays for all it's worth), then turns condescending
and bossy, and in the final scene somehow ends up alternately
spewing vitriol and platitudes. Elliott's character is
equally perplexing. There's no examination of why he is
unable to wrap up love, sex and marriage in a single package.
   The acerbic one-liners that dot the play, while often
amusing, don't satisfy even the appetite for frothy comedy.
It's like plunging into a bowl of whipped cream and searching
in vain for the chocolate cake and ice cream.
