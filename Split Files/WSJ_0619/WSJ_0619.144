   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said it sued eight
corporations, including Westinghouse Electric Corp. and
Potlatch Corp., for allegedly polluting the coastal waters
off Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif.
   Named in the suit, along with Pittsburgh-based
Westinghouse and San Francisco-based Potlatch, were Montrose
Chemical Corp., Wilmington, Del.; ICI Inc., a unit of
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of Britain; the Stauffer
Chemical unit of Rhone-Poulenc Inc.; Chris-Craft Industries
Inc., New York; Simpson Paper Co., San Francisco; and a
property owner named Atkemix 37 Inc., said the department's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

   The NOAA alleged that the companies dumped the pesticide
DDT and hazardous chemicals known as polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, from factories into sewers that emptied
into Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors and onto the Palos
Verdes Shelf off the Southern California coast.
   The contamination dates to the 1940s, the NOAA said, and
has injured fish, marine mammals and seabirds. For example,
the agency said that bottlenose dolphins and California sea
lions have higher concentrations of DDT and PCBs than any
other marine animals it has studied.
   The NOAA said the companies could be required to pay tens
of millions of dollars to restore the coastal waters and
habitat. Restoration could include removal or treatment of
underwater sediments, restocking fish or installing
artificial reefs.
   Mark Eames, an NOAA attorney, said that five of the
companies -- ICI, Chris-Craft, Montrose, Stauffer and Atkemix
-- were involved in a DDT-manufacturing plant near Torrance,
Calif., that closed in 1982. Westinghouse operates an
electric-equipment repair facility in Compton, Calif., that
Mr. Eames said releases PCBs. Simpson runs a paper-recycling
plant in Pomona, Calif., that he said also produces PCBs.
Simpson bought the plant from Potlatch.
   In January, the NOAA informed the companies cited, as well
as several others, that it might sue them. The agency said it
hadn't yet decided whether to sue the Los Angeles County
sanitation districts, which operate the sewers that carried
the chemicals. The NOAA was joined in the lawsuit by the
Interior Department and the state of California.
   Mr. Eames said this is the third action it has brought for
allegedly polluting coastal waters and harming fish and
wildlife. The first suit, involving the New Bedford, Mass.,
harbor, was brought in 1983; the second, involving Seattle,
was brought this year. Neither has been resolved.
   Montrose, Simpson Paper, Chris-Craft and Potlatch couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.
   Westinghouse previously said it was unable to "react or
comment" on the allegations because the company "doesn't know
what they (NOAA) are talking about." A Rhone-Poulenc
spokesman said earlier that none of the company's operations
caused any of the alleged pollution. She said the NOAA may be
confused because different pieces of Stauffer Chemical have
been acquired by various companies in recent years. The piece
bought by Rhone-Poulenc is now known as Rhone-Poulenc Basic
Chemicals and is based in Shelton, Conn.
   A spokesman for ICI previously said that the company was
still reviewing the NOAA allegations and couldn't comment.
