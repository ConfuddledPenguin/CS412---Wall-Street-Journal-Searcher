   WASHINGTON -- Major changes in high-school education and
workplace organization are needed to emphasize higher skills
and greater worker authority over how jobs are done, a work
skills commission said.
   The Commission on the Skills of the American Workplace
said that if both education and work systems aren't revised,
the U.S. will continue losing competitive ground to foreign
nations.

   Most U.S. employers have so far done reasonably well in
meeting foreign competition by using fewer, low-paid workers,
with low skills, the report said. But the focus must switch
to using better-educated, better-trained employees, with more
control over their work, or at least 70% of workers "will see
their dreams slip away," the commission said.
   The commission was formed by the National Center on
Education and the Economy, Rochester, N.Y., which was spun
off from Carnegie Corp. two years ago. Since 1986, the group
has issued reports urging restructuring of U.S. schools and
greater flexibility in federal funding of education for
disadvantaged youths.
   One company that already follows the high-skill, employee
"empowerment" approach is International Business Machines
Corp., the report said. When managers at IBM's Austin, Texas,
factory that supplies circuit boards for personal computers
said they could save $60 million by buying boards elsewhere,
IBM had other ideas.
   Because it pursues a full-employment, no-layoff policy,
managers instead cut costs by upgrading worker skills, the
report said. They organized workers into teams, giving each
responsibility for its own inspection, repairs and materials
ordering. Workers who had performed such indirect tasks were
assigned to production teams, and far fewer indirect
employees were needed.
   Job classifications were changed, reorganizing
manufacturing slots into categories with rising skill
requirements, the report said. Education and training
programs were launched; the plant now spends more than 5% of
its payroll to teach workers.
   According to the report, IBM says that the $60 million gap
has been closed. Productivity is up by more than 200%,
quality is five times better, and the inventory has been cut
40%. Production has risen 600%, and the plant employs more
people than ever.
   The Austin experience is a good example of what IBM has
been doing in the U.S. and abroad, Walton Burdick, senior
vice president for personnel, said in an interview. In both
manufacturing and service jobs, the aim is to "unleash more
of {workers'} innovative and creative" powers, he said.
   With more employee involvement in workplace functions such
as ordering supplies, setting schedules, keeping quality
records, maintenance and problem-solving, morale is higher
and productivity climbs, Mr. Burdick said.
   By contrast, the commission said "the vast majority" of
U.S. employers aren't moving to "high performance" work
organization, which requires educated workers, nor investing
to train employees. Fully $27 billion of the $30 billion in
annual training outlays is spent by 15,000 companies, only
0.5% of all U.S. companies, and fewer than 200 of these
employers -- large companies with significant professional
and managerial staff -- spend more than 2% of their payroll
on formal training, the report said.
   The commission is headed by Ira Magaziner, a consultant in
Providence, R.I., and by William Brock and Ray Marshall,
former U.S. labor secretaries. The study involved
interviewing 400 U.S. companies and comparing school and
workplace programs in six foreign nations with those in six
states. The commission recommended:
   -- A new high-level educational performance standard
should be set for high schools, and made a requirement to be
met by age 16.
   -- States should assure that nearly all students obtain a
certificate that they've met this standard. With federal aid,
they should also create alternative learning programs for
those who cannot reach the initial standard in regular
schools, and use youth centers to enroll school dropouts.
Youths shouldn't be allowed to work before age 18 unless
they've achieved the certificate or are enrolled in a program
toward it.
   -- A thorough system of technical and professional
education should be instituted for non-college-bound high
school graduates. Specific occupational skills should be
combined with general education.
   "Because we have failed to forge a relationship between
how well a student does in school and what kind of job he or
she can get, we have turned our high schools into little more
than holding tanks for non-college-bound students," Mr.
Marshall said.
   -- Employers should be given incentives and assistance to
invest in further education and training of their workers,
and to pursue workplace methods aimed at high productivity.
All companies would have to contribute at least 1% for
education and training.
   -- Employment and training boards should be set up by the
federal government and states, to help employers define their
worker skill needs, give workers access to training and help
local governments and others plan effective labor-market
programs.
