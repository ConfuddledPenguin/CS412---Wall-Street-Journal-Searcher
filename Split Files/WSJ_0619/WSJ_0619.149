   Flextronics Inc. said it expects to report a fiscal
fourth-quarter loss of $22 million on sales of about $41
million.
   Results for the quarter ended March 31 include costs
associated with the Fremont, Calif., company's recently
completed sale of a 55% stake in its Asian operations to an
investment group.

   In the year-earlier quarter, the disk-drive maker reported
a loss of $8.6 million on sales of $50.1 million.
   Flextronics said the asset sale will result in
"significant net profit" for the current quarter after
accounting for a onetime after-tax gain of about $13 million.
It didn't estimate the profit.

   FLEXTRONICS Inc., an electronics manufacturer, said a
fiscal fourth-quarter loss that it expects to report stemmed
from costs associated with the sale or closure of certain
U.S. operations. In Tuesday's edition, the cause of the loss
was misstated.
