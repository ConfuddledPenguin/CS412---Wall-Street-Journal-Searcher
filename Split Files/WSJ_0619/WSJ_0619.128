   Healthco International Inc. said it is considering a
merger or other actions to improve shareholder value, and has
had "recent expressions of interest in a transaction
involving the company." They didn't elaborate further.
   Shares of Healthco, a Boston dental equipment maker that
is facing a fight for control with Gemini Partners L.P., rose
$2.50 to $18 yesterday in heavy over-the-counter trading.

   Healthco set June 25 as the record date for a shareholder
consent solicitation that Gemini is making in an effort to
gain control of Healthco's board of directors. New York-based
Gemini owns just under 10% of Healthco's shares.
   Healthco said it hoped shareholders wouldn't make a
decision on the consent solicitation until it completes its
value-improvement moves. In order to elect its slate of five
candidates for Healthco's board, Gemini must obtain consents
from a majority of shareholders within 60 days from the
solicitation record date.
   Healthco said shareholders would have an opportunity to
review its value-improvement program at the annual meeting,
scheduled for Sept. 6.
