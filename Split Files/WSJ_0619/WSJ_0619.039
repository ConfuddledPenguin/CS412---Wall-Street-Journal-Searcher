   TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. said its Indonesian subsidiary
expects to pay total dividends this year of about $125
million, or 50 cents a share, assuming nickel prices remain
around their current levels.
   It would be the first dividend payment by P.T.
International Nickel Indonesia after a recent offering to the
public of 20% of the company's shares. However, the dividend
forecast is below that projected in the offering prospectus
in April.

   A spokesman for Inco, the Western world's largest nickel
producer, said the parent company would be entitled to
receive 58% of the dividend, based upon its equity holding.
He said the bulk of the P.T. Inco payment would be made as an
interim dividend in October.
   Inco also has received proceeds of $240 million from the
P.T. Inco share offering, which it expects to result in a
second-quarter gain for Inco of $125 million. Another 20% of
P.T. Inco is owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. of Japan,
with the remaining 2% held by various Japanese interests.
   In April, P.T. Inco said it expected to pay dividends for
1990 of $160 million, or 64 cents a share, and said it
expected net income this year of $110 million. It didn't make
a new earnings forecast.
   Since then, P.T. Inco has lowered its 1990 production
estimate to 70 million pounds from 80 million pounds of
nickel matte, which contains about 80% nickel, because of
various operating problems. It also lowered its expectations
for nickel prices.
   Inco said the average cash nickel price on the London
Metal Exchange for the first five months of 1990 was $3.72 a
pound, compared with an average of $5.82 a pound for all of
1989.
   It said every $1 change in the exchange's average price
for a year alters P.T. Inco's earnings by $50 million, or 20
cents a share, and its dividend payments by $60 million, or
25 cents a share.
   Last year, P.T. Inco had earnings of $182 million, or 74
cents a share, on revenue of $305 million.
