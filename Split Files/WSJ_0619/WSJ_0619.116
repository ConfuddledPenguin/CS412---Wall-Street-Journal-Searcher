   Foxboro Co. toughened its anti-takeover shareholder rights
plan less than a week after the company disclosed receiving
several takeover offers in response to its solicitation of
possible buyers.
   The toughening of the plan raised speculation that
Foxboro, a maker of industrial process controls, doesn't like
one or more of the suitors or offers it has in hand. The
company, based in Foxboro, Mass., hasn't named the suitors.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Foxboro shares fell $1.25 to close at $34.875.
   Under the amended plan, holders of Foxboro common would
get rights to purchase preferred shares at half the market
value after a party acquires 15% of Foxboro's common or after
a party deemed by Foxboro to be "adverse" acquires 10% of the
shares. Previously, holders could exercise the rights when
someone acquired 30% of Foxboro's shares.
