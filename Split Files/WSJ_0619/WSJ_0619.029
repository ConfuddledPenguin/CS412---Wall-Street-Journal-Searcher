   In a rumble on the docks, you'd want "Eze" (as in easy)
Burts on your side. He's tanker-sized at 6-foot-4 with
shoulders built for heavy lifting. In fact, however, Ezunial
Burts has a desk job at the Port of Los Angeles. The big
desk. He's in charge of the facility, which claims now to be
the nation's leading commercial harbor.
   The Port of New York can still cite statistics to
challenge that ranking -- it depends on what you measure --
but there's little question that Los Angeles and neighboring
Long Beach are eclipsing East Coast locations. Trade patterns
favor the Pacific, and deregulation and other factors have
made LA the loading dock for much of the country. According
to Mr. Burts, as many goods are transshipped out of Southern
California as stay to service its huge and growing market.

   To varying degrees, the story is similar in Portland,
Tacoma, Seattle and Oakland. Nowhere is the American payoff
from world trade more evident than at the thriving West Coast
ports, whose cargo tonnage should triple over the next 30
years, according to one commissioned study.
   That kind of growth requires billions of investment
dollars and makes someone like the Port of Los Angeles
director unusual in these times -- a public-sector builder.
In years past, a Robert Moses in New York might remake a
city. Nowadays tax money is spent elsewhere and great sums
aren't available for infrastructure, and the objections of a
few -- who once were overwhelmed, rightly or wrongly -- are
enough to stop a big project. Yet Mr. Burts's capital
spending exceeds $100 million a year, and he says that must
increase if his harbor, man-made early in this century, is to
remain world-class.
   He can deal on that scale because the port is its own
revenue base, in effect a $156 million-a-year corporation
quasi-independent of City Hall. And Mr. Burts, while paying
due homage to "public responsibility" and acting in a
deliberate style that can be seen as politically calculating,
says he runs his agency like an enterprise. Customers are
prized, and the director goes seeking them around the world.
   At home, he does face community pressures. The bordering
working-class town of Wilmington suffers the underside of
port life, such as truck traffic and toxic spills, and Mr.
Burts has been a target of the reaction. In general, however,
the port has made great environmental strides and the water
is relatively clean. A plan to expand the Los Angeles and
Long Beach facilities massively by the year 2020 has stirred
objections to landfills, but is aimed at moving hazardous
material away from the shoreline. Likewise, a rail corridor
linking the ports with the central LA freight yards is being
built to handle 60 to 90 mile-long stacked-container trains a
day at grade separations so as not to clog roads.
   If this universe puts Mr. Burts, at age 43, in the top
ranks of black U.S. executives, he can thank his political
stars. A couple of years after majoring in public
administration at his hometown college, California's Fresno
State, he won an urban fellowship from the National League of
Cities that brought him into the orbit of Tom Bradley, soon
to be elected Los Angeles mayor. For more than a decade, he
assumed increasingly powerful staff posts under Mr. Bradley,
until being named to head the port in 1984. Two years later,
he won a dogfight with another longtime Bradley ally who had
dominated the port from his seat on the Harbor Commission.
   In his fashion, Mr. Burts downplays the early difficulties
in a post that typically had gone to someone from shipping.
He says he exemplified a "changing of the guard" at ports,
hospitals and other specialized institutions, as generalists
skilled in management broke a more parochial mold. He also
reflects a dramatic coloration of the port's leadership in
recent years, as its officials increasingly mirror the makeup
of a polyglot city.
   The port's growth spurt, of course, predates Mr. Burts's
tenure. It is a highlight of Mayor Bradley's 17-year reign.
Traffic began to take off in 1976 and is up 150% since.
Aggressiveness is one reason. "We have 14 offices around the
globe" for marketing, says Mr. Burts. "We're not sitting here
in Los Angeles waiting for cargo to come." Often, that
entails putting manufacturers in touch with markets.
   With shipping companies now permitted to link formally
with ground carriers, the nature of the players changes. "A
steamship line that used to just operate on the water can now
tell a customer, a Hong Kong manufacturing plant or one in
Taiwan, that {it} will take this cargo and deliver it to the
doorstep of a consumer in Iowa," says Mr. Burts. The port,
using offices in New York or Chicago, will step in to find
back-haul loads for the overland trip back to LA.
   Those kinds of connections, added to the Panama Canal's
political and structural problems, have made West Coast
ports, especially Los Angeles, a preferred gateway for
Pacific Basin goods going east. And what is exported? Mostly
raw materials -- coal, cotton, scrap metal, petroleum coke,
waste paper. Although the volume is as great as that
imported, the valuation is less. The Los Angeles Customs
District's trade deficit has been shrinking along with the
rest of the country's, however, and Mr. Burts says that local
manufacturers of electronics, aerospace equipment, clothing
and furniture ship overseas.
   Although use of cargo containers has been the shipping
story of the past generation, allowing the Port of Los
Angeles's expansion to occur while the number of dock hands
fell (to 20,000), Mr. Burts wants to diversify while
expanding in case trade shifts. Already, the port boasts of
repairing some Navy ships more cheaply than the Long Beach
Naval Shipyard, a target for closure by the Defense
Department.
   If that's a form of contracting out, could the port itself
be ripe for privatization? While acknowledging that's
occurring in Britain and New Zealand, Mr. Burts maintains
that with most of its operations leased out to shippers
anyway, the Port of Los Angeles is lean as it is. (Its
payroll has risen by only a third since 1976, to nearly 800.)
And its bond rating is strong. "When ports begin to get
strapped for cash, they start thinking about" privatization,
he says. "That has fortunately not been a serious issue at
this port. We think that the system that we have is one that
works well for us now, and for the next couple of decades I
don't see it changing."
   One thing Western ports would like to change is the
wage-and-hour provisions of their contract with the
longshoremen, which is up this summer. In a 24-hour-aday
business, it doesn't help to have downtime on the docks.
Nevertheless, Mr. Burts, perhaps mindful of the mess a strike
shutting down the whole coast would cause, has only praise
for labor.
   A record-holding quarter-miler while a student athlete,
Mr. Burts has settled into the somewhat slower and
less-celebrated arena of port management. Held to a $133,500
salary, he sees a shift to the more lucrative private sector
sometime in his future. For now, though, he occupies a
Promethean perch, a ready symbol and spokesman for the
benefits of free trade.
