   The furor raging in Washington over the federal budget
deficit is good for scare headlines and political
sloganeering. But the budget summit in which President Bush
is now participating has nothing to do with economic reality.
It offers no proper justification for raising taxes or, for
that matter, cutting spending, to reduce the deficit.
   One reason the matter is urgent, we are told, is that the
need to bail out the Savings and Loans is making the deficit
worse. The S&amp;Ls may well have made some bad loans and
financed private spending that was not worthwhile. Or they
may have made long-term loans at rates of interest that have
turned out to be too low. In either event the market value of
their assets is insufficient to pay off their depositors and
other creditors. But all that is water over the dam, or more
accurately, money down the drain.

   If $180 billion of currency were to get washed away in the
sewage system -- or burned in a fire -- we would not think of
raising taxes to reimburse the losers. At that point it is
purely a paper matter. We would authorize the printing of
more money. That would in no way be inflationary; we would
merely be replacing the money that had been destroyed.
   Failing to replace that money would, to the contrary, be
most deflationary. It would almost certainly bring on a
financial crisis and very likely a sharp recession. And
taxing the public to get the money to reimburse the losers
would only compound the problem; the wealth of money-losers
would be restored at the expense of the rest of us.
   Yet this is exactly the situation with the S&amp;Ls. The
bailouts do not add to the money of depositors. They merely
keep them from losing their money -- that is, prevent the
quantity of money from being reduced. By keeping their
depositors and other creditors whole we are preventing cash
and other financial assets from going down the drain.
Refinancing or replacing those collapsing financial assets
does not add to the nation's spending or spending power.
   The government is not commanding new resources, as it
would when it builds missiles or roads. This is rather a
financial operation, like the pouring in of reserves and
liquidity to the banking system that Alan Greenspan and the
Fed undertook to stop the stock market crash of October 1987;
it may merely entail more, and more long-term, financial
intervention. Raising taxes to pay for this now is no more in
order than it would have been to bail out stock dealers
caught in the financial squeeze then.
   It may be pointed out that loan guarantees or deposit
insurance indirectly finance real spending just as they might
if treasury expenditures were made up front. In a sense, the
explicit and implicit deposit insurance or guarantees raised
the budget deficit at the time the S&amp;Ls made the loans that
ultimately turned bad. There might have been budget footnotes
over these past years mentioning these additional
expenditures and offering a measure of "the deficit"
including them.
   But the fact is the expenditures were made then. They then
financed the now half-empty office buildings or homes worth
only a fraction of their construction costs. Current
government borrowing to finance the purchase of S&amp;L assets
only makes explicit an element of deficit or debt that was
implicit earlier in the commitment of backing to S&amp;L
liabilities -- the deposits or money of S&amp;L creditors.
Whatever problems of fairness and equity it may impose, and
whatever may be indicated in the way of new arrangements to
prevent bad private loan practices in the future, the S&amp;L
bailout has nothing to do with the current budget deficit.
   Regarding the current deficit, and deficits more
generally, the simple fact is that deficits add to debt. They
do so for an individual or a business. They do so for
governments. The question for all is how fast debt is growing
and for what purpose.
   In a growing economy with more people and more product and
income, debt generally grows. It has in fact been growing
very rapidly for the private sector. One sensible first rule
of thumb is to keep that growth balanced -- that is, to keep
debt growing no faster than income.
   For the federal government that means keeping the debt
from growing faster than the national income, or gross
national product. This would keep the ratio of debt to
income, currently about 42% or three-sevenths, constant. That
ratio has of course been lower but it has also been much
higher, well over 100% just after World War II, with no
disastrous consequences. And it is not particularly high
compared to other countries.
   But the national income and GNP are growing at just about
7% per year. Maintaining a constant debt-GNP ratio would thus
require that the debt grow at 7% a year. With a federal debt
held by the public approaching $2.3 trillion (and a GNP
around $5.5 trillion) that implies an increase in the debt of
$161 billion.
   The deficit, assets sales and accounting gimmicks aside,
is exactly equal to the increase in the debt. We would keep
our debt in line with our income then by running a deficit of
$161 billion -- or 3% of GNP -- which is a bit more than the
deficit we have been running and is not exceeded by even more
alarmist projections of the deficit. In a meaningful economic
sense, not the sense of Gramm-Rudman, the federal budget is
now in balance, precisely the kind of balance that would be
welcomed by any business trying to travel a road of balanced
growth.
   The really serious problem is not now the size of the
government deficit but, as with most individuals or
businesses, what the borrowing is being used to finance. If
an individual borrows to finance gambling losses in Las Vegas
that is clearly bad. If a family borrows to invest in a new
home or the children's college education, most of us think
that is good. And if business borrows to invest in productive
new plant and equipment, not many of us would be critical.
   It should be the same for government at all levels. It is
past time for Mr. Bush and Congress to put behind foolish
posturing over mismeasured deficits and to face up to our
real needs. These are to assure a prosperous economy now and
the real investment, public and private, on which our
prosperity depends.
