   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, is expected to
name Frederick B. Rentschler as its new president and chief
executive officer today, industry officials said.
   Mr. Rentschler is currently president and chief executive
officer of Beatrice Co., the Chicago food company that
entered into a merger agreement with ConAgra Inc. two weeks
ago.

   Mr. Rentschler, 50 years old, would succeed Frederic V.
Malek, a member of the investor group led by Alfred A.
Checchi that acquired NWA last year. Mr. Malek would stay on
as NWA's vice chairman.
   Mr. Rentschler's appointment means that the top three
management positions at NWA will be held by executives with
no previous airline experience. For seven months, the company
has been run by Mr. Checchi, Mr. Malek and Gary Wilson, all
former Marriott Corp. executives. Mr. Wilson's only other
airline experience was as an NWA director.
   Mr. Checchi has tapped other non-airline executives for
key roles. Only two of the five vice presidents he has hired
since become chairman last September have ever worked for an
airline.
   Mr. Checchi is said to have selected Mr. Rentschler
because of his strong consumer-marketing background.
Northwest is trying to shed a reputation for lackluster
service. The Checchi group has said its goal is to make
Northwest the airline of choice for business travelers, who
usually pay the highest fares.
   Toward that end, Northwest plans to spend $422 million
over the next five years improving its food, upgrading its
aircraft interiors and retraining its employees.
   Mr. Rentschler is credited with turning around the
Swift/Hunt-Wesson foods division of Esmark Inc. before
Beatrice acquired that company. He was forced out in a
management shake-up in 1984 after the Beatrice takeover. He
returned to Beatrice in 1986 after its acquisition by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the New York leveraged buy-out
firm.
   Mr. Rentschler's future was uncertain at Beatrice in light
of the merger with ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb., food concern.
However, officials familiar with the situation said Mr.
Rentschler's NWA appointment had been in the works for weeks.
   Mr. Rentschler couldn't be reached. NWA declined to
comment. Mr. Checchi is expected to announce Mr. Rentschler's
appointment today at a press conference in NWA's St. Paul,
Minn., headquarters.
   Whether Northwest suffers from its top management's lack
of airline expertise remains to be seen. A number of its vice
presidents and middle managers, including its operations and
marketing chiefs, have extensive airline experience.
   Although the Checchi team is getting high marks from the
NWA staff, some employees expressed concern about Mr. Malek's
outside activities. For the past several months, he split his
time between NWA and his duties as chief organizer of a
seven-nation economic summit planned for next month.
   Mr. Malek, a friend and adviser to President Bush, is
expected to play an increasing role in the Bush
administration. That factor led to his decision to step down
from day-to-day duties at Northwest, people familiar with the
decision said.
   Northwest, the result of a 1986 merger between Northwest
Orient Airlines and Republic Airlines, is the nation's fourth
largest carrier. It is the largest U.S. carrier to the North
Pacific, a region that produces about a third of its revenue.
It has spent the past three years expanding its European and
domestic routes as well.
   The Checchi group acquired NWA for $3.65 billion last
August. The airline had a first-quarter operating loss of
$89.8 million on revenue of $1.62 billion. It has forecast a
modest profit, its first since the takeover, for the second
quarter.
