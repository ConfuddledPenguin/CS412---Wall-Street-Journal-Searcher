   Milan -- Researchers in Great Britain have discovered that
during the World Cup, suicides drop by about 15%. But
scientists in West Germany have determined that heart attacks
are likely to rise. And so it goes during the monthlong
extravaganza; soccer fans take the good with the bad. For
example, millions of partisans from all over the world
continue to root for their teams, even though a Kenyan witch
doctor named Abubakar Omar Shariff already has announced that
Italy will win the tournament.
   The Italians are taking nothing for granted, however, and
have been showing a stern face of late. Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti has said that the people responsible for bungling
World Cup preparations should be thrown off a cliff, the same
one that was used to execute traitors in classical times. The
Italian team doctor has forbidden his players to eat butter
during the tourney, instructing them to increase their pasta
intake. "It's important not to tire out the digestive
system," he says. Host cities have banned the sale of all
alcoholic beverages during game days. And the pope had to cut
short a visit to the parish of San Remigio in Rome because a
match was starting. "The pope must not even try to compete
with the national duty to be in front of the television," he
pontificated.

   The Italians have been so distracted by the games that
they have entirely neglected what would otherwise be the
story of the hour. A man in Naples is filing a claim with an
insurance company, arguing that because another driver hit
his parked car, his girlfriend got pregnant. The crunch
apparently distracted him during lovemaking: "We were minding
our own business when we were hit by the other car and that's
when my girlfriend became pregnant."
   It's the British, though, who have had the worst few
weeks. First, British beef was banned on most of the
continent. It's not clear how you can tell, but apparently a
lot of British cows have gone crazy. The Europeans fear that
by eating British beef they will get Mad Cow disease
themselves. In the U.S., crazy cows would be
de-institutionalized and classified as "homeless," but in the
U.K. they get their heads chopped off, are piled into big
mounds, and get charbroiled.
   British soccer fans have not had it quite that bad, but
almost. Innocent non-hooligans have been attacked by local
fans, and are having trouble gaining admittance to bars and
restaurants.
   In Europe, even hooligans have bureaucracies. British
police keep files on about 500 known hooligans; those that
set foot on Italian soil are being kept under surveillance
during their stay. But the West Germans have caused the bulk
of the trouble. In Milan some of them went on a mini-rampage
the afternoon of their game against Yugoslavia. Fortunately,
on the subway train to the game that evening, I was wedged in
next to a preppy hooligan, and therefore felt pretty safe. He
had a blue cravat tucked into a sharply pressed Oxford shirt,
covered by a gray, V-neck cardigan. Around his neck there was
a brass horn that would allow him to urge on his team in
three different octaves.
   If the German fans want to look intimidating, they are
going to have to stop wearing those weenie hats. Many a
rough-hewn face was topped by a soft creampuff of a bonnet in
the shape of failed souffle. Perhaps it is a legacy of
central planning, but the Yugoslavs only sported one type of
hat, a simple baseball cap with Yugoslavia written on the
front, serviceable for many occasions.
   There was almost no drinking around the stadium, though
there was trash everywhere, and not a garbage receptacle to
be seen. The scalpers were given relatively free reign. Each
transaction was monitored by dozens of onlookers, trying to
track the market-clearing prices as they fluctuated
throughout the afternoon. I was offered a single ticket for a
price, expressed in Italy's exponential currency, of 15 times
10 raised to the fourth power, or about $125.
   Each fan was probed by the police at the entrance to the
stadium, in a manner too personal to describe here. The
inspection was of intense interest to prospective smugglers,
most of whom realized their own efforts to sneak contraband
into the stadium would be foiled. If a fan was carrying a
flag on a wooden dowel rod, it was replaced with a harmless
cardboard version.
   The German fans are known for being extremely optimistic,
and they often begin celebrating their team's victory before
the game starts. Fully two hours before play commenced, they
already were singing their lungs out and jumping up and down,
an exertion that was to continue almost without break over
the next four hours. Fortunately, the Milan stadium has
passed its safety inspections, unlike many others, including
Rome's.
   For the American, World Cup soccer offers several bizarre
spectacles. In the first place, no player ever just falls
down. He writhes on the ground in ostentatious agony for a
good 30 seconds until the trainer scrambles out and all eyes
are upon him. Then, those apparently shredded ligaments are
miraculously healed, and the player rises with a manly
grimace.
   The player who suffers the most mental agony is the
goalie, who is perpetually disgusted with his players. Either
he is exasperated by their inability to run faster up the
field when he is about to kick the ball, or he is sickened by
their lack of defensive hustle. Sometimes he seems as if he
is about to storm off the field in a fit of rage.
   Americans also will find that European football generates
a less rationalistic style of television commentator.
American football requires an engineer's skill for
diagramming complex schemata. But soccer is more like music,
and the commentators talk about the flow of the game, and the
imagination and creativity of the players.
   As for the American team, it emerged with its
self-respect, after only being beaten rather than dismembered
by the Italian team. All the same, Americans have not shown
much interest in their team, as all the empty hotel rooms in
Florence, where the U.S. plays, demonstrate. It now seems
like a giant mistake to hold the World Cup in the U.S. in
1994. That will merely make life inconvenient for the
billions who do care about soccer. On the other hand, maybe
the U.S. will pass some anti-hooligan laws in 1994 and apply
them to the Detroit Pistons.
