   The Charleston, W.Va., law firm that successfully
represented four people in a $10.3 million environmental suit
against Ashland Oil Inc. alleges that the company has since
encouraged acts of intimidation against the plaintiffs.
   "We are going to show Ashland that they can't intimidate
people here," said P. Rodney Jackson, a plaintiffs' lawyer
with DiTrapano &amp; Jackson, who filed an amended suit against
the oil refiner in Kanawha Circuit Court in Charleston.

   That suit didn't include the allegations of encouraging
intimidation; they will be filed later this week as part of a
related complaint, Mr. Jackson said.
   Ron Wallace, director of employee relations at the
company's Ashland Petroleum unit, concedes he helped form an
employee group that now numbers 4,000 to look into litigation
that could be brought against the plaintiffs. But both he and
Ashland deny any hand in trying to physically intimidate
plaintiffs, as Mr. Jackson alleges. Mr. Jackson claims the
company is causing acts of intimidation by making people
afraid of losing their jobs.
   "We feel that we're the injured parties here and that the
plaintiffs haven't been injured in any meaningful way at
all," said Mr. Wallace. Ashland is 23%-owned by its
employees.
   Ashland asked the Kanawha Circuit Court to overturn the
$10.3 million verdict or to grant the company a new trial. In
the trial, the plaintiffs -- residents of the area near the
refinery -- convinced the jury that the quality of their
lives had been impaired by pollution from the plant.
   The company alleged that 297 errors occurred during the
trial, among them, that jurors were allowed to hear
misleading evidence, garbled or incorrect jury instructions
and an inflammatory closing argument. In addition, the
company alleged that one of the jurors had been represented
in an unrelated personal-injury case by the plaintiffs' law
firm and that the juror should have disclosed the
relationship.
   Calling the trial "unfair" and the award "ridiculous," Mr.
Wallace said the verdict against Ashland could result in job
cutbacks and other economic hardships in the tri-state area
around Catlettsburg, Ky., where Ashland operates a refinery.
He claimed Ashland's plant there doesn't pollute any more
than other big employers in the region and that employees of
other companies also could lose jobs if other pollution suits
are filed.
   Ashland, through a spokesman, said it was aware of a
report about vandalism and intimidation published in Monday's
Charleston Gazette newspaper. But the spokesman said the
company hadn't verified the report and didn't necessarily
believe it. "Quite frankly, we're repulsed by these things if
they, in fact, had occurred."
   The story said a pickup truck and automobile had been
vandalized at two plaintiffs' homes in separate incidents and
that a woman plantiff had received a phone call in which she
was warned she wouldn't receive any of the money that she had
won in the trial against Ashland.
   In the plaintiffs' amended suit, Mr. Jackson's firm added
680 new complainants to the 500 originally listed. The
amended complaint seeks more than $2 billion. The case
against Ashland is being heard five plaintiffs at a time.

   HONG KONG practices of some U.S. law firms prove
disappointing.
   More than a dozen U.S. law firms have flocked to Hong Kong
over the years, setting up regional bases in the hopes of
capitalizing on the country's central location and new
economic opportunities in Southeast Asia. But many firms are
still grappling with how to best take advantage of those
opportunities -- and some have concluded that Hong Kong
doesn't seem to be the answer.
   "There is no question that the projection for economic
growth in Asia is substantial. But U.S. law firms haven't had
the kind of action they had anticipated," says Ward Bower of
Altman &amp; Weil, a legal management consulting firm in Newtown
Square, Pa.
   The latest firm to give up on Hong Kong is the New York
law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, which
has decided to close its five-lawyer Hong Kong office,
effective July 31. The firm's regional presence will be
consolidated in offices in Beijing and Tokyo. "We took a
realistic look at the environment we were dealing with and
reached a conclusion we felt was in our long-term interests,"
says Lewis A. Kaplan, a Paul Weiss partner.
   In recent years, Shearman &amp; Sterling and Simpson Thacher &amp;
Bartlett, two New York-based firms, have also closed branches
in Hong Kong.
   Separately, Graham &amp; James, a 360-lawyer firm, is forming
an association with 90-solicitor Deacons, one of Hong Kong's
largest law firms, effective Aug. 1. Under the association,
believed to be the first between a U.S. law firm and a Hong
Kong law firm, Graham &amp; James will close its Hong Kong
outpost and relocate to the Deacons office. The two firms'
Beijing offices will be combined, and Deacons lawyers in
Tokyo and New York will join Graham &amp; James's offices in
those cities.
   Under the present rules, U.S. lawyers are not allowed to
practice Hong Kong law and must refer work to local firms.
"There's only so much {foreign lawyers} can do. You're
limited in terms of economics and professional practice with
how far you can go. This {association} allows us to provide
the entire package of legal services to the client," says J.
Michael Cavanaugh, managing partner of Graham &amp; James.
   Political and economic troubles in China have also hurt
many of the U.S. firms, according to lawyers who have
practiced in Hong Kong. "There weren't the kind of big deals
and joint ventures coming out of China that everyone
expected," says John Kramer, the former head of Shearman's
Hong Kong office.
   Most of the firms say it is still too early to anticipate
what will happen after 1997, when China resumes sovereignty
over Hong Kong. But at least one firm is optimistic about the
future.
   Last October, New York-based Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&amp; Flom opened an office there. "We think there is great
potential in the Far East," says Peter Mullen, Skadden's
executive partner. But he adds that following China's
suppression of student-led demonstrations last year, the firm
scuttled plans to open an office in Beijing.

   KAYE SCHOLER considers merger with bankruptcy boutique
Levin &amp; Weintraub.
   Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, a 355-lawyer New
York law firm, and the 14-lawyer New York bankruptcy firm
Levin &amp; Weintraub, Crames &amp; Edelman will decide by the end of
next week whether to merge their practices, according to
lawyers involved in the merger discussions.
   In recent months, Levin &amp; Weintraub has reportedly
approached several large firms about the possibility of
merging. The firm's clients, many of them debtor companies
involved in bankruptcy-law proceedings or restructuring,
include Manville Corp. of Denver, which has emerged from such
proceedings, and Dallas-based LTV Corp. The merger talks were
first reported in the New York Law Journal.
   Over the past five years, many bankruptcy firms have
merged with larger, more diversified firms. Because
bankruptcy problems are increasing in size and complexity,
boutiques must farm out much of a client's work to larger law
firms, bankruptcy lawyers say. "A bankruptcy case today
almost always has as its root something more than just
money," said Nathan Feinstein of Piper &amp; Marbury, who chairs
the American Bar Association's Business Bankruptcy Committee.
   Although the merger would substantially expand Kaye
Scholer's existing bankruptcy work, some of the firm's 106
partners harbor doubts about the proposal, because it would
involve granting partnerships to five lawyers from Levin &amp;
Weintraub, according to an individual close to the deal. He
said the firm has a tradition of not bringing in large
numbers of lateral partners.
   Kaye Scholer represents a number of large institutional
creditors, and some of the firm's lawyers are also concerned
that absorbing Levin's debtor clients might harm the firm's
image among its creditor clients, the individual said.
   Approval of the merger requires a two-thirds majority vote
by Kaye Scholer partners, according to another individual
familiar with Kaye Scholer's acquisition activity. The vote
will take place later this week, the individual said.

   PUNITIVE DAMAGES should be allocated to a "public
purpose," some lawyers propose.
   Defense lawyers have complained that punitive damages --
which are intended to punish the defendant and deter future
wrongdoing -- provide an unfair windfall to the plaintiff.
   If punitive damages are permitted at all, some defense
lawyers argue, these damages should be used to serve some
public purpose rather than to enrich the plaintiff. The
plaintiff should be allowed to receive only compensatory
damages, these lawyers say.
   Some 70 defense and plaintiff lawyers, along with
academics, journalists, insurance representatives and
industry officials, debated the pros and cons of such a
proposal last month at a meeting of the Seventy-Eight
American Assembly, a symposium gathered at Columbia
University to stimulate discussion on developments in tort
law. Debate split sharply between the plaintiff and the
defense bars, with many academics siding with defense
lawyers.
   "A corporation, if it does commit a wrongful act, should
not be punished over and over again for the same offense,"
says Leslie Cheek III, senior vice president for public
affairs at Crum &amp; Forster Inc. in Washington, D.C. Instead,
says Mr. Cheek, a company should be required to pay a large
punitive damage award only the first time it is found liable
for an offense. And the money, he says, should not go to the
plaintiff.
   "The idea is you make it a public atonement; you maximize
the publicity associated with that kind of conduct," says Mr.
Cheek, who participated in the symposium. Such a system would
still serve as a valuable deterrent against future misconduct
without exposing defendants to double jeopardy or driving
them into insolvency, he adds.
   How the punitive award would be spent might be determined
by the judge, by agreement of the parties or by some other
method.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers maintained that the idea would put an
end to punitive damage award. "You may as well say no more
punitive damages as say that punitive awards should go to a
public interest, because no {plaintiff} will go after them,"
says plaintiff's lawyer Paul D. Rheingold, in New York, who
was also a participant at the symposium. "Their hidden agenda
is to eliminate punitive damages."
