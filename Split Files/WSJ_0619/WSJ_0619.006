   LONDON -- Wages and salaries per unit of output in the
manufacturing industry in April rose a seasonally adjusted
0.7% from March and increased 7.6% from a year earlier,
Britain's Central Statistical Office said.
   The index, which is based on the year 1985 equalling 100,
was 121.3 in April and 120.4 in March; year-earlier figures
have been revised and aren't comparable.
