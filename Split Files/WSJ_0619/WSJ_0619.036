   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Nelson Mandela has been
trying to climb down from the pedestal of his legend since
the moment he stepped out of prison in February. "I am no
prophet," he told reporters a few days after his release,
"and it is not at all correct to elevate a human being to the
position of a god."
   But, as he begins his first visit to the U.S. tomorrow,
Mr. Mandela's pedestal is, if anything, a bit higher.
Wherever the 71-year-old African National Congress leader
goes, barnstorming around the world in his campaign to keep
the pressure on the South African government, curious
multitudes strain to see, touch and hear him. He may not be a
god, but Nelson Mandela, blessed with a double-helping of
charisma, is certainly an extraordinary idol.

   "Traveling with Mandela," marvels Joe Slovo, an ANC
colleague, "is like traveling with Elvis."
   Since his release from 27 years in prison, Mr. Mandela has
covered more ground than the Pope, sweeping through Africa,
Europe and now North America. His travels have shown that he
is a human being after all. He gets tired often, suffers from
jet-lag and, during a recent pit-stop in Johannesburg, was
hospitalized for a week of rest and a minor bladder
operation. And, like all human beings, he has ruffled some
feathers. His embrace of Yasser Arafat, the Palestine
Liberation Organization chief, irked the world's Jewish
community; his tribute to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's
"commitment to human rights" raised eyebrows in the West; his
early talk of nationalization dismayed the business
community.
   Still, in the crucial battle for international acclaim
being waged by all sides in South Africa, the Mandela legend
-- the unbowed prisoner refusing to compromise his principles
-- prevails. While Mr. Mandela's presence is desperately
needed at home to calm the storms of changing South Africa,
the ANC also needs him abroad to counter Pretoria's recent
diplomatic offensive.
   Last month, South African President F.W. de Klerk traveled
through Europe and won high praise for his reforms, which
include releasing Mr. Mandela, unbanning the ANC and other
opposition groups, lifting much of the state of emergency and
moving toward negotiations on a new constitution based on
black-white power sharing. It was a triumphant tour for a
government so long shunned by the rest of the world, and Mr.
de Klerk returned home confident the Europeans were ready to
review their economic sanctions against South Africa.
   But Mr. de Klerk is no Elvis. Last week, Mr. Mandela
campaigned through Europe -- a mass rally here, tea with
royalty there -- and with his refrain, "I still have no
vote," effectively recaptured the ground Mr. de Klerk had
won. (Mr. de Klerk has decided not to challenge Mr. Mandela
in the U.S., postponing a visit once scheduled for this
month.) Mr. Mandela argues that to lift sanctions now, while
the essence of apartheid remains, would be like "a stab in
the back." And who, say his colleagues at the ANC, would do
such a thing to a man who has sacrificed three decades of his
life fighting for racial equality?
   "Mr. Mandela is a type of man one doesn't get very often,"
says Ahmed Kathrada, who was sentenced to life imprisonment
along with Mr. Mandela in 1964 and now is the ANC's publicity
director. "He's an exceptional leader, with ability,
charisma, courage and sacrifice."
   Despite the tremendous pressure on his tours -- in the
U.S., he will go from a ticker-tape parade to a meeting with
President Bush to a joint session of Congress to mass rallies
across the country -- Mr. Mandela is relaxed, as if he has
been shaking hands and kissing babies for the past 27 years
instead of sitting in jail. When he walks into a room, his
face lights up, offering winks and smiles to all those
present. In his speeches, one minute he may quote nursery
rhymes, the next Shakespeare. He has kind words for his
adversary, Mr. de Klerk, and even offers encouragement. He
shows no trace of bitterness.
   His trademark is a right fist raised over his head,
symbolizing the victories thus far of the anti-apartheid
forces. But on this trip, behind the scenes, his hand is
often open and outstretched, soliciting contributions for the
ANC's work in South Africa.
   At home, Mr. Mandela's colleagues are just as busy as he
is. "In jail at least we could get some sleep," says Walter
Sisulu, Mr. Mandela's 77-year-old colleague who was also
sentenced in 1964.
   Mr. Sisulu is heading the efforts to re-establish the ANC
as a legal political party inside South Africa, where it had
been banned for the past 30 years. To compete with the ruling
National Party, the ANC is scurrying to set up branch offices
across the country, establish a communications and publicity
network and begin grassroots canvassing.
   It isn't easy, says Mr. Sisulu. "I'm dissatisfied with our
progress," he admits. "We're not getting down to the masses."
   As a result, the ANC leadership finds itself reacting to
events more often than shaping them. There are repeated calls
to stop the violence in black townships, yet it goes on. The
students are told to go back to school to end the black
education crisis, but then the teachers go on strike over a
lack of books and overcrowded classrooms. The government is
pressing the ANC to come to consensus more quickly, so the
negotiation process can proceed.
   In addition, the released prisoners face the problem of
adjusting to the 1990s. The telephone in his office buzzes
and Mr. Sisulu fumbles to hit the right button. Mr. Kathrada,
who is 60, says he tried to use a cordless telephone at his
home and then in frustration unplugged it and put it in a
closet. He is still battling with his newfangled Gillette
razor, and still trying to solve the mysteries of his pager
and the office fax. He's leaving the computers to the younger
generation of ANC activitists.
   "When we went to prison, computers were the size of a
room," says Mr. Kathrada.
   In an odd way, though, both men say prison helped them and
Mr. Mandela prepare for their present hectic lives. For one
thing, they were able to exercise often; Mr. Mandela
exercised for two hours every day. For another, the prison
diet of porridge and meat kept them trim. "No junk food,"
says Mr. Kathrada. Then, too, in the last several years of
prison there was regular access to newspapers, and plenty of
time to read them.
   But nothing was able to prepare them for the sustained
reception following their release. "I thought that within two
or three weeks the euphoria would be over and we'd be able to
establish ourselves into some sort of normal routine," says
Mr. Kathrada.
   The others worry about Mr. Mandela's stamina and health,
and he worries about them. But after nearly three decades in
prison, none of them is going to slow down now.
   Mr. Kathrada laughs as he recalls flying to Cape Town with
Mr. Mandela on a jam-packed South African Airways plane. Both
of them were looking forward to two hours of quiet work in
preparation for a meeting later that day with Mr. de Klerk.
Shortly after takeoff, though, several children approached
Mr. Mandela for his autograph. He happily obliged, only to
find a line of children backing up through the plane.
   "Nelson had a chat with each child," says Mr. Kathrada. "I
was trying to tell him, `Just sign your name,' but he wasn't
satisfied with that. He had to write a little message,
including the name of the child." It went on like this until
20 minutes before landing when the pilot invited Mr. Mandela
into the cockpit.
   Mr. Kathrada rolls his eyes. They never did get to their
work.
