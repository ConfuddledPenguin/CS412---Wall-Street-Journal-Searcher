   Snyder Oil Corp. said Oryx Energy of Dallas agreed to
operate and become owner of as much as 50% of Snyder's 38,500
acres in the Austin Chalk Field in south Texas, in exchange
for paying lease, seismic data and other costs.
   Snyder, an energy acquisition, development and production
concern in Fort Worth, Texas, said the project was previously
operated by Wolverine Exploration, which continues as a
partner. Seismic work is expected to begin shortly, with
additional drilling expected by late 1990 or in early 1991.

   The company also said it is in talks with about ten large,
independent companies regarding a joint venture to explore a
portion of its acreage in northern Colorado and southeastern
Wyoming.
