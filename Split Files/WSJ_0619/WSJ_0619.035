   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. named a
new chief financial officer and new presidents for three of
its publishing companies.
   Gary J. Arnold, senior vice president and secretary, said
the moves are designed to get a "new team in place" for John
S. Herrington, who was recently named chairman of the
publishing and insurance concern, and Peter Jovanovich, who
was recently named chairman of the board's executive
committee.

   Harcourt has been struggling under debt linked to its 1987
recapitalization. Along with the personnel changes, Harcourt
said, it is consolidating its corporate finance department
with its publishing finance department to cut costs.
   Robert E. Evanson, 53 years old, was named chief financial
officer. He succeeds John Berardi, who left the company to
pursue outside opportunities. Mr. Evanson most recently
directed Harcourt's university, professional and
international publishing.
   Marcus L. Boggs, 42, was named president of Harcourt's
Academic Press Inc., an international publisher of books and
scholarly journals for the natural, physical and social
sciences, filling a vacancy. Mr. Boggs had been executive
editor, humanities and social sciences, in Harcourt's college
department.
   Bill M. Barnett, 59, was named president of the college
division of Harcourt's subsidiary, Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston
Inc., in Fort Worth, Texas, succeeding David Dusthimer. Mr.
Barnett had been president of Harcourt's college department.
   Robert A. Pawlik, 49, was appointed president of
Harcourt's college department, based in San Diego, which
specializes in the fields of accounting, English, history,
political science, computer science, mathematics and social
sciences. Mr. Pawlik had been national sales manager in the
college department.
   Mr. Arnold, the senior vice president, said the company
doesn't anticipate any changes in management at its other
major publishing arm, the elementary and high-school textbook
division. That division has done poorly in the past 18
months, after failing to meet changing demands from
educators. Last year, Harcourt took an $88 million write-down
to cover obsolete inventory in the division.
