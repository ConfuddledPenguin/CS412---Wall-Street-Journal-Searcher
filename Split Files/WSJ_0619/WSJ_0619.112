   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
launched its automated system for trading securities in the
private-placement market.
   Securities firms and other institutions have been waiting
for the NASD to hook up the system, known as Portal, ever
since regulators in April passed rules making it easier to
sell and trade privately placed securities.

   Portal, short for Private Offerings, Resales and Trading
through Automated Linkages, will be able to handle any bond
or stock traded under the new regulations, the NASD said. The
system automates trading in the estimated $200 billion
private-placement market by allowing use of personal
computers and Nasdaq terminals to trade. Nasdaq is the NASD's
automated quotations sytem.
   Twenty major U.S. and European securities firms,
accounting for about 80% of the activity in privately placed
stocks and bonds, have signed up for the new trading system,
the NASD said. Four financial institutions, representing
pension and investment funds world-wide, also have been
approved as qualified buyers, it said. And 60 more
institutions are expected to join soon, according to the
NASD.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission in April
unanimously approved Rule 144a, allowing large market players
to trade among themselves in the private-placement market
without going back to the registration and disclosure
process. Only institutions that own $100 million or more in
securities can buy private placements under the rule.
