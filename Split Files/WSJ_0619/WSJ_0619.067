   NEW YORK -- Technical factors achieved what economic
fundamentals haven't for weeks now: The dollar was pushed out
of its narrow trading bands against the mark. The U.S.
currency ended lower against all other major currencies
except the Canadian dollar.
   In trading late in the morning in New York, the dollar on
its way down crossed a line at 1.6830 marks where complex
charts told currency traders to sell it. Traders gave
differing reasons for the dollar's move to that point. Some
cited manipulations of a speculator, others pointed to the
preceding drop in U.S. stock prices, while still others
pointed to rumors suggesting the European Monetary System
will soon be realigned and that European central bankers want
to dump the Louvre Accord.

   What happened afterward isn't in doubt.
   "It dropped like a stone," said Robert Ryan, foreign
exchange manager for Bank of New York. "People got caught the
wrong way, and they panicked."
   As they did so, the currency price passed levels -- at
1.6770 marks, for instance -- where stop-loss orders to sell
dollar were tripped.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6758
marks, down from 1.6875 marks late Friday in New York. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 153.66 yen, down
from 153.90 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7145, up from
$1.7095.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 153.70 yen
soon after opening at 153.45 yen; it closed Monday in Tokyo
at 153.88 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
about 1.6755 marks, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6855
marks.
   Monday's plunge shook many dealers who had grown
complacent during the quiet morning hours. After some
volatility on Friday, said Alexis Egan, corporate foreign
exchange trader for Banque Indosuez, "people were comfortable
with the dollar settling back into its range {of 1.68 to 1.70
marks}. A big move was the last thing people expected, and it
took everyone by surprise."
   It also left participants looking for a "story" -- what
started it all. "People not willing to accept technical
answers look around for fundamentals," said David Gilmore,
foreign exchange analyst for McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei.
   Mr. Gilmore said he doubted fundamentals provoked the
plunge, but he wouldn't discount another explanation. A
speculative player, knowing the market wanted to buy dollars
until 1.6810-30 marks and sell dollars thereafter, may have
decided to take advantage of the thin, non-aggressive
dealings to swing the price there by selling large amounts of
dollars, he said.
   "So they go for it," Mr. Gilmore said. "They don't need a
story if they can get {the dollar} through support, and
there's nothing underneath it."
   The most likely fundamental to have precipitated the
decline is a late morning decline on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down 20
points in late morning trading, ended 53.71 points lower.
   The decline in the Dow contributed to "a soft sense that
things are going wrong {in the U.S.}," suggested Mr. Ryan of
Bank of New York.
   With recent indicators suggesting a slowing U.S. economy,
dollar traders have recently begun to take more seriously
such worries as higher estimates of the cost of the
savings-and-loan bailout and missed debt payments Friday by
Donald Trump.
   But Banque Indosuez's Ms. Egan, a self-described "chart
person," said she doubts fundamentals played a role in
yesterday's retreat. "There wasn't a tremendous amount of
interest in pushing the dollar lower," Ms. Egan said, noting
that the support it found at 1.6720-30 marks was only "soft."
   The dollar still could fall below its bottom yesterday in
the days ahead, Ms. Egan said. The market is technically
poised for a dollar rebound after the decline, she said --
"If everyone is short dollar, you can't go shorter" -- but
the fundamentals for the dollar are mixed.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $349.30 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $348.15 an ounce.
