   NEW YORK -- Despite a flurry of efforts to make 24-hour
trading a reality, investors probably won't see the full
scope of this high-tech future for years.
   A new system for U.S. night trading of options and stocks
was announced by the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, the CBOE's Cincinnati Stock Exchange
and Reuters Holdings PLC of Britain. Mainly for options, the
system could one day also handle hundreds of stocks including
those listed on the New York Stock Exchange. But the new
partners said it could be two to three years before the
system is up and running.

   Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange's own plans for
24-hour trading could also be years down the road, despite
the Big Board's recent acceleration of movement in the area
and its prediction that a minimal amount of after-hours
trading could start as soon as this winter.
   There are two global electronic systems that will be
starting up in the near future, however. The National
Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq
over-the-counter trading system, on Sept. 1 is launching
Nasdaq International, which will offer computer-screen
trading of 400 to 500 stocks starting at 3:30 a.m. Eastern
time, before traditional U.S. trading hours. Also, the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters may have the Globex
after-hours trading system for futures running as soon as
November.
   Still, the day when stocks, futures and options all are
traded in the U.S. away from exchanges' traditional trading
hours won't be here for perhaps several years.
   "We see a world impatient for change, impatient for the
21st century to begin," James R. Jones, chairman of the
American exchange, said in announcing the Amex/CBOE venture.
   Leo Melamed, head of the Chicago Merc, said in an
interview that investors interested in such systems must be
patient. "If we're talking about (24-hour trading) in its
full scope -- securities, options and futures -- well, I
wouldn't want to speculate how long it'll take to get them
all on."
   R. Steven Wunsch, an expert on electronic trading systems
who formerly worked at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said, "It's
even questionable whether people need to trade continuously
in the daytime, much less the nighttime." Like other experts,
Mr. Wunsch said he's unsure about the size of the potential
audience for after-hours trading.
   Of course, the pace of change could be quickened by more
joint ventures between the exchanges.
   Indeed, Mr. Melamed and the chairman of the CBOE, Duke
Chapman, both said there are preliminary discussions about
one day merging the Amex/CBOE system with Globex, especially
since both systems are being run through Reuters. Such a
merger would potentially create a dominant after-hours
network for stocks, futures and options and give any Big
Board system a run for its money.
   A combined system, especially if it includes additional
exchanges, would offer investors "the total flexibility of
options, stock-index options as well as futures and futures
options," Mr. Melamed said, adding that he's excited by the
"magnetism of volume attraction that such a system would have
world-wide."
   The proposed CBOE/Amex system would operate between 6 p.m.
and 6 a.m. Eastern time. The exchanges and Reuters have a 12
1/2-year agreement, they said, which was approved by the
boards of the CBOE, American and Cincinnati exchanges in the
past two weeks. Regulatory approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission is still required.
   Even before any of these modern systems blow their first
fuse, their backers are posturing about whose system is best.
   For example, in an unexpected development, the Amex/CBOE
partners said that they had, through Reuters, invited the Big
Board "several times" to join their new system and that they
hoped the invitation would be accepted. The Amex/CBOE
partners clearly enjoyed the implication that the mighty Big
Board would fall in line behind them.
   Big Board officials responded with thinly veiled sarcasm.
"We'd like to invite them to join our off-hours trading
system," said the Big Board's spokesman, Richard Torrenzano.
"It would seem unnecessary for them to build a redundant
system" to the Big Board's trading operation, which can
handle "on an average day all the trading capacity of all the
stock exchanges of the world," he said.
   The Big Board has been talking about 24-hour trading for
about two years. "We could move more expediently than anyone
else in this process" if investor demand is there, said Mr.
Torrenzano.
