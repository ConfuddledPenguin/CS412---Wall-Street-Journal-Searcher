   Great Western Financial Corp. said it agreed to acquire
$700 million in Florida retail deposits from Carteret Savings
Bank, Morristown, N.J.
   Great Western will pay $26.5 million, or about 3.7 cents
on the dollar, for the deposits. The price includes the
purchase of certain Carteret branch offices in Palm Beach and
Broward counties, Fla.

   Great Western, a Beverly Hills, Calif., savings and loan
concern, said the acquisition will increase its Florida
deposit base by 40% and substantially boost its presence in
Palm Beach County, one of the fastest-growing areas of the
nation.
   Carteret, a unit of AmBase Corp., said the sale is a "key
element" in its plan to streamline its retail banking and
concentrate on New Jersey markets.
   The proposed acquisition is considerably smaller than an
earlier Great Western plan to acquire about $2.4 billion in
deposits of CenTrust Bank, another New Jersey concern with
substantial Florida holdings. That deal, which called for a
cash payment of $150 million, or six cents for each dollar on
deposit, collapsed when CenTrust was seized by federal
regulators after running up huge junk-bond losses.
