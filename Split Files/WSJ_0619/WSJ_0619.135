   WASHINGTON -- Bush administration officials plan to
recommend a veto of legislation that would overhaul federal
housing programs, partly because the bill would allow new
federally financed housing construction.
   A draft of a statement threatening a veto outlined seven
"major problems" the administration has with the National
Affordable Housing Act. The draft, being prepared by housing
and budget officials, said the bill's Housing Opportunity
Partnerships would create a "costly, poorly targeted new
housing construction program" that wouldn't meet the needs of
the poor. The bill's sponsor said it emphasizes that housing
rehabilitation is a priority but permits new construction
where necessary.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp previously has voiced
objections to the bill, but this would be the first time the
administration issued a veto threat on the bill.
   Mary Brunette, a top assistant to Secretary Kemp, said the
administration is "certainly prepared to offer a veto" if
there is no resolution of certain issues, including what
administration officials consider inadequate funding for Mr.
Kemp's plan to encourage home ownership by low-income
families.
   Administration officials also object to the bill because,
according to the draft statement, it would: require
one-for-one replacement of public housing units that are
sold; include "excessive funding" for Farmers Home
Administration new rural housing construction direct loans;
and defer mortgage payments for very low-income borrowers.
   The officials also complained that the bill exceeds the
administration's housing budget for the Agriculture and
Housing and Urban Development departments by $5 billion for
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   If the bill "were presented to the president in its
current form, his senior advisers would recommend that the
bill be vetoed," reads the draft statement.
   The administration apparently decided to send a veto
threat to the Senate after Mr. Kemp and White House Budget
Director Richard Darman met with the bill's sponsor,
California Democrat Alan Cranston, yesterday morning.
   During a midday news conference, Sen. Cranston was
optimistic that differences between the Senate and the
administration would be resolved. He said Mr. Kemp
specifically indicated the administration wasn't threatening
a veto at that time. Negotiations among the budget office,
HUD and Senate staff members yesterday afternoon, however,
did little to resolve the disagreements. An administration
official said the bill is seriously deficient.
   Donald Campbell, staff director of the Senate's Housing
subcommittee, said a letter sent to Mr. Cranston from Mr.
Kemp last week indicates the administration has a "gross
misunderstanding" of what the bill would do.
