   In a move signifying the continued weakness in the once
lucrative Northeast shuttle market, the Trump Shuttle is
quietly planning to cut more than 25% of its flights on
Saturday and four other round-trips  on Sunday.
   The change, which takes effect July 1, will likely
inconvenience hundreds of travelers. The airline isn't
planning any formal announcement, even though shuttle service
has been operated on an hourly basis for years.

   "I assume we'll have some people showing up for canceled
flights," says Bruce Nobles, president of the Trump Shuttle.
But Mr. Nobles said the airline may compensate these people
with extra frequent-flier mileage points or some other bonus.
   So far, Trump's arch rival in the shuttle market, Pan Am
Corp., hasn't matched the change. Harris Herman, president of
the Pan Am Shuttle, said he was considering some schedule
adjustments, but added he didn't want to confuse the public.
The airlines have traditionally matched each other's fare
changes.
   Together, the two carriers carry about four million
passengers a year between New York and Washington and New
York and Boston in what had been considered one of the
industry's most prized routes. Fares are high -- $119 one-way
-- and the passenger clientele is among the industry's
richest.
   But since acquiring the shuttle from Eastern Airlines last
year for $365 million, real estate mogul Donald Trump has
watched the carrier struggle -- primarily because business
travel has slacked off in the Northeast. As reported, the
Trump Shuttle lost at least $85 million since starting up.
Much of the loss was from debt service, and the carrier
earned over $2 million from operations last April, according
to documents obtained by this newspaper. But Trump officials
concede the carrier's passenger loads have been below
expectations.
   In response, the shuttle recently laid off about 70
employees and cut back a few frills, such as its concierge
desk. Now it is planning to cancel four daily round-trips  in
both the Boston-New York and Washington-New York market on
Saturday, as well as two other flights in each market Sunday.
Those two days are easily the slowest ones for the shuttle
and Mr. Nobles said he was trying to "match capacity with
demand." He said the move wouldn't lead to more layoffs,
because the carrier would use the planes for more charter
flights.
