   You've seen it on TV] The "seminar" on making millions in
real estate. The "talk show" about a miraculous anti-aging
cure. The "investigative report" about the healing powers of
bee pollen.
   You may be seeing less of it starting now. After an
explosion of "infomercials" during the laissez-faire Reagan
years, the Federal Trade Commission has launched a crackdown.

   In several recent cases against infomercials -- including
one touting a diet aid that had the former president's son,
Michael Reagan, as host -- the FTC has set out guidelines for
the first time. Among other things, the new rules make it
virtually impossible for some of the dicier infomercials,
hawking miracle cures and diet claims, to get on the air.
   Since 1985, when the first "infomercials" were broadcast,
the half-hour and hour-long commercials for often
dubious-sounding products have exploded. Shown late at night,
they look like bad versions of "Donahue." They promise cures
for baldness and arthritis, aging and impotence. As their
hosts, they have fading celebrities like former "Carol
Burnett Show" regular Lyle Waggoner (for an impotence cure)
and onetime "Man from U.N.C.L.E." star Robert Vaughn (a
baldness elixir).
   The FTC has served notice on the ad community by not
prosecuting the fly-by-night companies that make many of the
offending products. Instead, the FTC is prosecuting the
infomercials' producers, which create the programs and often
fill the orders as well, and who have deeper pockets.
   Taking on the production companies "may be a more
effective means of law enforcement than pulling dandelions,
going after each of the little companies out there," says
Joel Winston, assistant director of the division of
advertising practices at the FTC. He adds: "There's real
concern that infomercials are being used to push bogus
products. There is more than the usual share of fraudulent
advertising through these infomercials."
   The FTC has brought just a half dozen cases against
infomercials. Its breakthrough case came in April, in an
action against Twin Star Productions of Scottsdale, Ariz.
Twin Star had been airing three infomercials for various
products, including a spiel by Mr. Reagan for a patch worn on
the wrist that was supposed to be a diet suppressant. Other
informercials were for a baldness cure and a male impotence
cure; the latter message was in the form of a talk show with
Mr. Waggoner as host.
   The FTC claimed that the products' claims were false and
unsubstantiated and that the 30-minute infomercials misled
people into thinking they were consumer programs, not paid
ads. Twin Star signed a consent decree under which it agreed
to pay $1.5 million and not to air the infomercials again.
   As part of the consent agreement, which has been open to
public comment and isn't yet official, the FTC set out the
guidelines for infomercials. Among other things, it demands
"reliable scientific evidence" before a product can make any
performance or safety claims. It requires infomercials of 15
minutes or longer to include disclosures saying the program
is a paid commercial. The disclosures must run at the
beginning and end of the program, as well as before ordering
instructions are given.
   Twin Star's chairman and president, Jerald Steer, says the
company believes it "didn't do anything wrong" and "it wasn't
fair for us to be singled out by the FTC." But, he says, he
is "glad . . . because now we have some rules to follow. The
problem with the FTC and the infomercial business is there
were no rules."
   Already, there are signs that the FTC, through its Twin
Star and several previous actions, is putting a damper on
some of the more dubious infomercials. Mr. Steer, for one,
says that while he used to accept claims made by doctors
selling products through infomercials, "I would no longer run
that today without doing our own studies." Twin Star does
still run infomercials for products like the "Stainarator"
spot remover and "Joe Namath's Power Band" exercise equipment
but puts the "paid commercial" disclaimer on them.
   TV Inc., a Largo, Fla., infomercial producer, has gone a
step further. It will no longer create infomercials for
"anything that has to be ingested," whether that be diet
pills or health foods, says William M. Thompson, president.
"There's too much baggage. If you have health and nutrition
claims, you'd better come up with {ironclad} studies. This
isn't kid stuff."
   Mr. Thompson should know; he, too, has felt the wrath of
the FTC. TV Inc. recently settled a case involving an
infomercial for Mountain High Bee Pollen, which claimed to
provide relief for everything from allergies to aging to
arthritis. After being charged with deceptive advertising
last year, TV Inc. agreed to send a letter to purchasers
telling them the program was a commercial and that its claims
were unsubstantiated.
   Mr. Thompson says he had "no problem" with the FTC, and
that he will no longer deal with the bee pollen company. TV
Inc. now also uses "paid commercial" disclaimers and
investigates the background of people trying to sell things
through its infomercials.
   In an interview, the FTC's Mr. Winston suggests some other
infomercial practices the FTC looks askance at. It frowns on
infomercials that masquerade as programming by taking
"commercial breaks." It also sees a red light when
infomercials are set up as "investigative" reports; Mr.
Winston dubs those "the most clearly deceptive." But
infomercial producers and sponsors interviewed say they don't
see any need to change those practices until they hear a
directive from the FTC.
   To the casual viewer, it might not seem as if much has
changed despite the FTC's involvement. Real estate and
baldness cure infomercials still rule the airwaves. In
congressional hearings about infomercials earlier this month,
even the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group,
lashed out against infomercials and asked that the FTC hold
"producers and advertisers . . . to the same high standards
for truthful, nondeceptive advertising as would be required
for any other advertising format."
   But TV Inc.'s Mr. Thompson says viewers just don't realize
how selective infomercial producers really are. Just consider
the products his company has turned down, he says. Among
them: A Palestinian group wanted to sell "Freedom stones" --
the rocks they throw at Israelis -- for $19.95 each, while a
woman wanted to sell a no-fail diet that she explained she
learned from extraterrestrials.

   WHO'S NEWS: Joseph Schulte was named executive vice
president and general manager at Wells, Rich, Greene's
Dearborn, Mich., office. He was previously an executive vice
president at Ross Roy, Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
                                                                                                       

   BOYCOTT UPDATE: Red Apple, a large New York City
supermarket chain, is to announce today that it plans not to
order any Folgers coffee from Procter &amp; Gamble for 60 days.
Red Apple is supporting a boycott directed by Neighbor to
Neighbor, an organization that advocates ending U.S.
investment in El Salvador and urges consumers to boycott
coffee containing beans grown there. Neighbor to Neighbor
said Red Apple, which also operates the Gristede's chain, is
the first supermarket chain to join the boycott.
                                                                                                       

   STAKE REDUCED: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. said New York
investment adviser Tweedy, Browne Co. Limited Partnership cut
its stake in the ad giant to less than 3% from 4.08%. Under
U.K. laws on disclosure, holdings of less than 3% -- lowered
from 5% June 1 -- don't require disclosure, and the company
didn't volunteer the exact size of its reduced holding. A
Tweedy Browne spokesman declined to comment; a Saatchi
spokesman didn't know why Tweedy Browne reduced its stake.
