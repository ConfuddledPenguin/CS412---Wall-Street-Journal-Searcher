   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its
ratings on nearly $900 million outstanding of Western Union
Corp.'s senior secured notes, senior unsecured and
subordinated debt and preferred stock.
   The credit-rating concern downgraded Western Union's
senior secured notes, senior unsecured and subordinated debt,
and preferred stock to single-D from, respectively,
triple-C-plus, triple-C-minus and single-C. The action
affects about $642 million of debt and $254 million
liquidation value of preferred.

   Western Union, a telecommunications and financial services
company, failed to make interest payments Friday on $500
million of 19 1/4% senior secured extendible reset notes due
1992 and senior unsecured 16% notes due 1991.
   The company is seeking to restructure its debt, saying it
can't meet debt payments from current cash flow. S&amp;P said a
restructuring would greatly reduce cash debt service and
eliminate accrued dividend arrearages on the preferred.
Western Union said it hopes to complete such a restucturing
by mid-July.
