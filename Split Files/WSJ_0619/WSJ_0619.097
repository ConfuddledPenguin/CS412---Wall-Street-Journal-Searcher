   Key Centurion Bancshares Inc., Charleston, W.Va., said it
plans to postpone a stock-repurchase program as a result of
three recent merger proposals. In addition, the bank said its
monthly purchases, when they resume, will be smaller than
announced in February.
   Under a $12 million stock-repurchase plan, the bank has
bought back about 237,000 of its common shares. It has about
20.7 million common shares outstanding, a spokesman said.

   Now the bank said it doesn't plan any stock buy-backs
until the fourth quarter. At that point it will begin
purchasing $300,000 of its common stock on a monthly basis
rather than $1 million of common stock on a monthly basis.
   However, Key Centurion said it still anticipates
eventually purchasing a total of $12 million of its common
stock.
