   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- As the Excalibur hotel-casino lowers
its drawbridge to the public for the first time today,
executives are hoping a horde of 50,000 or so will storm its
battlements.
   With 4,032 rooms, the hotel is the biggest ever built,
with a casino the size of four football fields and the
world's largest restaurant to boot.

   How does Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., the Excalibur's
owner, plan to upstage the premiere of the Mirage just up the
Strip, when prize fights and celebrities galore introduced
gamblers to a towering man-made volcano and white tigers? Or
the opening of Donald Trump's billion-dollar Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City?
   "We'll just open the doors and let 'em in," says Glenn
Schaeffer, Circus's chief financial officer. "They won't come
to hear the speeches."
   That understated approach reflects the success of a
company that has made its mark by catering to the family
market in Las Vegas, targeting relatively low-rollers. And
unlike Donald Trump or the Mirage's Steve Wynn, William
Bennett, the Excalibur's mastermind and the chairman of
Circus Circus, is unlikely to be recognized by the casino's
clients.
   Circus's reputation rides on the performance of the $290
million Excalibur. Wall Street has run up the company's stock
about 23% since March on the widespread expectation that the
new casino will pay off big. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Circus shares closed unchanged
at $61.25.
   While some competitors must generate more than $1 million
a day to break even, Excalibur's $200,000 break-even point is
designed to produce steady cash flow almost immediately, Mr.
Schaeffer says.
   But even though the keep-it-simple approach of today's
opening cuts down on complications -- and eliminates millions
of dollars of the "complimentaries" other casinos lavish on
high rollers -- Excalibur's launch is a huge undertaking even
for the most experienced managers.
   Circus executives spent months troubleshooting everything
from the electrical and computer systems to the rolls of
quarters for the casino. Excalibur requires a cast of 4,400
employees, including jousting "knights" for two nightly
dinner shows -- not to mention a stable of horses. It has
2,600 slot machines, 100 table games, 12 restaurants and
retail stores, a "medieval" village with carnival-style
games, two motion-simulation theaters, crafts and strolling
entertainers.
   On the eve of the grand opening, Circus executives were
still troubleshooting.
   Over the weekend, the whine of sanders meshed with
piped-in chamber music as construction workers, managers,
casino staffers and others hustled to finish last-minute
touch-ups. In the porte-cochere, workers refinished walls
with ersatz stonework and hung banners to make the area look
less austere. "It looked fine on paper, but it just didn't
bring the castle experience to the front door," Richard P.
Banis, Circus's president, says as he surveys some 11th-hour
remodeling.
   Inside the four-level megacasino, a few evenings of
practice runs unearthed a rash of last-minute glitches. "You
never know how these things are going to run until you fill
them up," says Bill Paulos, Excalibur's general manager,
shortly after emerging from an hours-long meeting spent
analyzing the previous night's dry run. Once a casino opens,
he notes, it stays open indefinitely, 24 hours a day, with no
down time for repairs outside the public's sight.
   Minor problems pop up. Keys don't fit properly in doors,
which could send scads of guests back down to the front desk
as hundreds of others are trying to check in. A retail
point-of-purchase system goes haywire, victim of a damaged
wire. Doors open the wrong way. "Those things we can fix
pretty easily," Mr. Paulos says.
   But king-sized openings invite king-sized problems.
   At the Taj Mahal's opening in April, the torrent of coins
coursing through the casino literally broke the bank,
triggering a modified meltdown of the slot-accounting system
that left rows of machines shut down for weeks. The count
rooms, where the coins are tallied and stored, were bursting
at the seams. Balky machines gobbled up gamblers' currency,
then refused to spit out coins in exchange.
   At the Mirage, the glitches were less visible to the
public and thus less disruptive. But within 15 minutes of the
ribbon cutting in November, security guards had to swoop in
to control traffic at the doors because tens of thousands had
already packed the entire floor. Gamblers bought up so much
coin so quickly that the casino was caught short. The
computerized bar system went on the blink.
   Circus executives say they've learned from their own and
others' experiences that deciding what to leave out can be
almost as important as what is included in a new project. Mr.
Paulos says the company is staying away from new, untested
machines, such as change counters and computerized restaurant
order systems. Instead of relying on technology to handle the
huge demand for change at the opening, Excalibur is using a
fleet of armored trucks to help sell change out in the
parking lots.
   Although Excalibur is a step up from Circus' other themed
properties, it's not too big a step. Room service, for
example, is limited. Circus executives know that its
customers don't expect caviar, lavish suites or huge lines of
credit in exchange for an average $45 room rate and a meal
ticket of less than $5. "Eating in the rooms isn't part of
what we're doing here," Mr. Schaeffer says.
   So far, the formula has worked. With Excalibur's opening,
Circus Circus will operate roughly 10,200 Nevada hotel rooms
and about 435,000 square feet of casino space. The company
has scratched its way to the industry's top ranks by
producing hefty profit margins, strong earnings, return on
equity and steady expansion that make it the envy of
competitors. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1990, Circus
reported net income of $75 million, or $2.60 a share, on
revenue of $522.4 million.
   Like many analysts, Circus's competitors also expect the
Excalibur to do well. Steve Wynn, chairman of Golden Nugget,
owner of the Mirage, sees success for the new venture. Mr.
Bennett, Circus's chairman, has "a terrific feel for the K
mart end of the business," says Mr. Wynn.
   Mr. Bennett says he thinks Excalibur may increase Las
Vegas's visitor count by perhaps 5%. Although the company is
already looking to the future, Mr. Bennett says Circus is at
least two years away from "anything that requires a lot of
cash," such as a new project. In that time, Excalibur may
help Circus slash its $500 million in debt in half. But for
today, all eyes are on the castle.
   "The good news is that it should be a real success," says
John Rohs, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., who has
upped his earnings estimates for Circus. But Excalibur "could
have a more pronounced impact on Circus Circus Las Vegas,"
possibly drawing patrons from the company's huge
circus-themed property a few miles up the Strip.
   One thing that the best plans can't eliminate are
last-minute anxiety attacks. Mr. Banis confesses somewhat
sheepishly that he has had nightmares. "You know," he says,
"what if you throw a party and no one comes?"
