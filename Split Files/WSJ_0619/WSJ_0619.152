   A 465-foot barge carrying more than five million gallons
of heating oil ran aground near a Massachusetts tourist
haven, the second oil spill in that area in less than a week.
   Four of the barges's fuel tanks, with a total capacity of
1.2 million gallons, ruptured when the vessel foundered in
Buzzards Bay, Coast Guard officials said. But by late
yesterday only a minuscule amount of oil had leaked from the
vessel, they added. Because the damaged tanks were only
partly full, seawater, which is heavier than oil, rushed in
and forced the oil away from the ruptures, the officials
said.

   "There is no significant discharge yet," said Petty
Officer Elizabeth Brannan.
   Don Tuchman, an official with Mobil Corp., owner of the
oil cargo being carried by the barge, said: "Coast Guard
officials inform us they are optimistic that the oil spilled
can be easily cleaned up with no damage to beaches or sea
life."
   According to the Coast Guard, the barge's owner and
operator, Bouchard Transportation Co., has agreed to pay for
any cleanup. Within hours of the grounding cleanup contractor
Clean Harbor Inc. had put booms into the water downwind of
the barge. Other vessels were on their way to unload the oil.
   The Coast Guard said it doesn't yet know the cause of the
spill, but one official said poor visibility because of fog
appeared to play a major role.
   In the past two weeks, there have been two oil spills in
New York Harbor and a fire aboard a tanker spilled oil into
the Gulf of Mexico. Last week, the cruise ship Bermuda Star
ran aground in Buzzards Bay, only two miles from yesterday's
grounding, spilling about 7,500 gallons of residual fuel oil.
