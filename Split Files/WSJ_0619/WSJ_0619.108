   NEW YORK -- Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. formed a joint venture
with two Soviet companies, allowing the accounting and
professional-services firm to audit balance sheets of Soviet
concerns and of ventures between Western and U.S.S.R.
companies.
   The venture will be owned 70% by Arthur Andersen, 25% by
Promstroybank of the U.S.S.R., and 5% by an engineering
company, NPO Dinamo Moscow. Arthur Andersen said it is the
first of the major international accounting and consulting
firms to be registered to do audits in the Soviet Union.

   The move follows by a few days the announcement by KPMG
Peat Marwick, also a major accounting and consulting firm,
that it expects to have the first Chinese joint accounting
venture approved by the Beijing government.
   Arthur Andersen's venture will be "servicing international
companies going into the Soviet Union and helping current
Soviet enterprises structure and restructure to get ready for
the global environment," said Paul W. Hoffman, a partner in
Arthur Andersen's office here.
   The venture marks Arthur Andersen's return to the Soviet
Union. "We were there from the first days of detente in the
early '70s, when we were expecting more U.S. investment," Mr.
Hoffman said. But "things got very quiet in the late '70s,"
particularly after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the
firm left in 1983, Mr. Hoffman said.
