   NEW YORK -- Stock prices posted their steepest declines in
almost five months as a dimming of hopes for lower interest
rates and flurries of futures-related selling took their toll
on the market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 53.71 to 2882.18
as blue-chip issues ran into selling in the aftermath of
Friday's quarterly expiration of stock-index futures and
options.

   With the help of buying stemming from the expiration, the
industrial average ended last week by setting its 11th
all-time high since mid-May. But the average followed up that
performance by posting its sharpest point loss since Jan. 22,
when it skidded 77.45 points.
   "The market was certainly overdue for a little bit of a
break," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. Selling among investors looking to take profits
after the earlier runup helped set the decline in motion,
traders said.
   Index-arbitrage sell programs, involving the sale of
baskets of stocks and the purchase of index-futures contracts
to profit from price differences between the two, battered
the market several times during the session. A late flurry of
arbitrage selling helped send prices skidding to session lows
at the close.
   Declining stocks routed advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,230 to 353. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
skidded 6.03 to 356.88, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 2.93 to 194.93 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index lost 5.15 to 332.50.
   Trading activity, which swelled Friday as a result of the
quarterly expiration, slowed to a sluggish pace. Just
133,470,000 shares were traded on the Big Board, compared
with 205,130,000 Friday.
   Investors who had been anticipating a move by the Federal
Reserve to ease monetary policy began backing away from that
view Friday after the report on May industrial production,
which went up 0.6%, proved better than expected.
   Further weakness in the bond market, where Treasury issues
had fallen sharply Friday in the wake of the production
report and other economic data, was also cited as a factor
hurting stocks. In late trading yesterday, Treasury notes and
bonds were posting losses of as much as 3/8 point, or $3.75
per $1,000 face amount.
   At record levels, the stock market wasn't prepared to
weather that kind of disappointment, analysts said. "This
market has been driven by sentiment more than anything else,"
said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Another problem at this point, Mr. Clough said, is that
investors appear to have become focused more sharply on
growth stocks amid nervousness about corporate earnings, to
the detriment of the overall market.
   "The market's tendency has been to chase a few stocks to
levels which are, by historical measures, pretty high," he
said, adding that his firm's comparison of earnings and
dividend yields on stocks to the yield on the benchmark
30-year Treasury bonds shows that stocks had become 15% to
20% overvalued.
   Boeing, a blue-chip issue that has been a favorite among
investors recently because of strong commercial orders for
its planes, fell 1 1/8 to 59 on Big Board composite volume of
1.2 million shares. Among other actively traded blue chips,
International Business Machines lost 1 5/8 to 118 3/4, Philip
Morris dropped 1 1/4 to 42 3/4, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph slid 7/8 to 41 7/8 and General Electric fell 1 to
69 1/8.
   Compaq Computer plunged 4 3/8 to 123 5/8 amid the
company's introduction of new laptop and desktop computers,
which had been expected. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., citing the
stock's previous advance to its price target of $125 to $130
a share, removed it from the firm's recommended list.
   Chrysler rose 3/8 to 15 1/2 on 1.1 million shares on a
published report that the auto maker and Fiat of Italy may be
pursuing an alliance, ranging from a broad international
marketing deal to a merger. Chrysler declined to comment.
   Selling accelerated in Southeast Banking, the Big Board's
most active issue, which fell 3/4 to 10 1/2 as 1.6 million
shares changed hands. The stock had tumbled 2 5/8 points
Friday after the company projected losses for the second
quarter and year and reduced its dividend.
   Global Marine dropped 1/2 to 4 3/8 on 1.5 million shares.
Norsk Vikingolje, a Norwegian investment and oil-drilling
concern, disclosed that it had lowered its stake in the
company by about one-third, to 4.4%.
   Also, Barron's magazine reported that Michael Katz, a
money manager who specializes in selling stocks short,
considers Global Marine to be one of his three current
favorites for short sales. The others are Stone Container,
which fell 1 3/4 to 17 3/4, and Cablevision Systems, whose
Class A shares dropped 1 to 29 1/8.
   Plum Creek Timber plunged 2 5/8 to 25 1/4 after this
newspaper reported that the partnership's logging practices
-- including the felling of forests at a faster pace than
they can be regenerated -- have become a source of
controversy in the Pacific Northwest.
   UAL lost 2 1/8 to 155 5/8. This paper reported that the
26,000 non-union workers at UAL, the owner of United
Airlines, may oppose the planned buy-out by its three major
unions.
   Businessland fell 1/2 to 8 1/4 after dismissing its top
two marketing and sales executives, a move that reflects
management's concern with the company's performance in the
two areas.
   Scott Paper gained 1 to 47 as analysts responded favorably
to news of the company's plans to acquire a 51% stake in the
sanitary tissue operations of Feldmuhle, a West German
concern, through a joint venture. George Adler, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said the venture is "important
strategically."
   Medtronic, which won a round before the Supreme Court in a
patent-infringement dispute with Eli Lilly, rose 1/8 to 79
3/8. The court ruled a company may defend itself against
infringement charges by showing that it used a patented
medical device solely to gather data for the Food and Drug
Administration. Lilly slid 1 1/2 to 76 1/2.
   Carter-Wallace added 1/2 to 53 after a favorable report in
Barron's, which noted that the company has been stepping up
its research effort and keeping an eye out for acquisitions
while maintaining strong financial performance.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.27
to 360.76. Volume totaled 11,010,000 shares.
   Home Shopping Network slid 1/2 to 8 1/4. The company
posted net income of four cents a share for its fiscal third
quarter, compared with a year-ago loss; analysts had expected
slightly better results.
