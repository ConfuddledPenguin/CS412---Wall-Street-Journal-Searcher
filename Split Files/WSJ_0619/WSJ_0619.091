   NEW YORK -- Bankers Trust New York Corp. said it laid off
75 employees in its flagship bank's corporate finance
department, reflecting the slump in mergers and acquisitions.
   The layoffs, which represent about 10% of the corporate
finance department's professional staff, cut across all lines
of business and include not just New York, but also regional
offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, said
Ralph L. MacDonald Jr., managing director and head of the
corporate finance department. He said the staff reductions
will save about $10 million annually.

   Additionally, Mr. MacDonald said Bankers Trust created two
new units -- a corporate finance group and a banking and
finance group -- to advise corporate clients on methods of
restructuring and financing. The corporate finance group will
act as advisers to senior corporate clients on such matters
as strategic restructuring and mergers, while the banking and
finance group concentrates on specific methods for financing
corporate clients.
   Mr. MacDonald said the changes and layoffs "recognize that
the volume and form of corporate finance restructuring will
be driven primarily by strategic rather than financial
considerations in . . . the '90s." Although total volume of
such transactions clearly has slowed, he said global
competition will continue to force companies here and abroad
to become more efficient.
   "Financial institutions that will be successful in this
new environment will be characterized by both leaner staffing
and a greater emphasis on relationships with senior corporate
managers," he said. He conceded that Bankers Trust hadn't
done as much to cement relationships with corporate clients
as it might have and that the reorganization is aimed at
increasing the company's commitment to its corporate clients.
   Bankers Trust isn't alone in trying to cope with reduced
restructuring and merger activity. Most investment banks and
money center banks that participated in the merger mania of
the late 1980s, building expensive teams of talented
dealmakers, now are struggling for pieces of a much smaller
pie. According to Securities Data Co., the value of domestic
mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of 1990 totaled
$49.7 billion, less than half the $102.6 billion in deals
announced in the first quarter of 1989.
