   OTTAWA -- Prospects now appear dim for ratification of
Canada's proposed Meech Lake constitutional accord by
midnight Friday, a legal deadline.
   The Meech Lake accord is a package of constitutional
amendments that were drafted to deal with Quebec's demands
for greater autonomy. Political polls in Quebec indicate
strong support for Quebec separation from Canada if the Meech
Lake accord doesn't receive the necessary ratification by all
provincial legislatures.

   The proposed amendments have run into strong opposition in
Manitoba and Newfoundland, which haven't yet ratified them.
   In Manitoba, a native Indian legislator, Elijah Harper,
yesterday blocked for the fifth time in a week efforts by the
Manitoba government to introduce a Meech Lake ratification
bill in the Manitoba Legislature.
   The Manitoba government can introduce the bill in the
legislature tomorrow without Mr. Harper's consent. But
political analysts said Mr. Harper, an Indian chief, could
use other procedural measures to delay consideration of the
bill beyond the Friday midnight ratification deadline.
   The Manitoba Assembly of Chiefs, which is advising Mr.
Harper, said their quarrel wasn't with Quebec, but with a
process of constitutional negotiations that hasn't addressed
their longstanding demands for greater self-government.
   The Manitoba chiefs yesterday rejected as inadequate new
federal government proposals to deal with their
constitutional concerns after the Meech Lake accord is
ratified.
   Phil Fontaine, leader of the Manitoba Assembly of Chiefs,
said in Winnipeg: "Our position is absolutely firm. We will
do all we can to ensure the demise of the Meech Lake accord."
The proposed amendments, which were negotiated three years
ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, would recognize Quebec as a
"distinct society" within Canada and grant new powers to all
provinces.
   Newfoundland's Legislature is to vote on a Meech Lake
accord ratification bill later this week. But Newfoundland
Premier Clyde Wells said he may cancel the vote if Manitoba's
Legislature isn't able to make a ruling. The outcome of a
vote by the Newfoundland Legislature is uncertain. The other
eight provinces have ratified the amendments.
   To extend the ratification deadline beyond Friday midnight
would require legislative action by all provincial
legislatures. Quebec has so far refused to consider any
extension.
   The political uncertainties have unsettled Canadian
financial markets. The Canadian dollar declined by 0.25 of a
U.S. cent yesterday to close at 85.13 U.S. cents in Toronto.
   Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, warned of
further Canadian dollar weakness if the Meech Lake accord
fails. He said such weakness would delay but not eliminate
the prospect of a decline in Canada's comparatively high
interest rates.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sent his top constitutional
adviser, Sen. Lowell Murray, to Winnipeg to try to get the
native leaders to drop their opposition to the constitutional
plan. But Chief Fontaine said the federal proposals didn't
contain "anything new. So there was no way that the chiefs
could accept that."
   Sen. Murray said he was "disappointed but not surprised"
by the Manitoba chiefs rejection of the federal government
proposals. He didn't indicate that the federal government was
planning any further initiatives to deal with the impasse.
   Provincial government leaders of Newfoundland, Manitoba
and New Brunswick agreed to submit the constitutional plan
for ratification by their legislatures after a week of
negotiations in Ottawa earlier this month. New Brunswick
ratified the accord Friday, becoming the eighth province to
do so.
