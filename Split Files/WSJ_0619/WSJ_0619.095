   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- After a worse-than-expected fiscal
third-quarter loss, National Semiconductor Corp. said it
returned to profitability in its fourth quarter on the
strength of record quarterly revenue. For the period ended
May 27, the company posted net income of $4.7 million, or two
cents a share, on revenue of $456.3 million.
   In the year-earlier period, the semiconductor maker had
net of $77.1 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of
$419.1 million. Year-earlier net included a gain of $174.9
million on the sale of assets. For the year, National
Semiconductor posted a loss of $25 million, or 34 cents a
share, on record revenue of $1.68 billion. In its previous
year, the company had a loss of $23.2 million, or 32 cents a
share, on revenue of $1.65 billion. The previous year's net

   National Semiconductor has been hit hard by slumping
prices and margins for its memory chips and customized
semiconductors, conditions that have plagued the industry in
general. The company posted losses for the first and third
quarters of the year just ended after a string of quarterly
losses in fiscal 1989.
   As for the current quarter, National Semiconductor said
that although its first period is a "seasonally slow" time,
the company was "encouraged" by record bookings in its fourth
quarter. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, National Semiconductor closed at $7.125, down 50
cents.
