   TOKYO -- It's 9:25 on a Friday night, but here at Norin
Chukin Bank, about 50 Japanese men in shirt sleeves are
staring into computer terminals, preparing to alter the
course of U.S. interest rates.
   In five minutes, the monthly employment numbers will be
announced in Washington. If the employment figure is too big,
the Japanese traders will suspect inflation is on the rise
and sell U.S. Treasury bonds. That, multiplied by similar
actions in dozens of other trading rooms across the city,
could drive up interest rates for the U.S. government, U.S.
home buyers and U.S. corporations.

   More than ever before, U.S. interest rates are made in
Japan. Large financial institutions here have become such
huge players in American markets that Wall Street analysts
constantly fret over whether "the Japanese" will participate
in a coming Treasury auction or whether they will divert
their money to Europe.
   Some analysts argue this dependence has made American
markets more volatile. Single Japanese institutions control
huge blocks of money, and can, if they choose, pull out
quickly. Such scare scenarios, however, are largely
overstated. Fears that this year's drop in the Tokyo stock
market would spill over to Wall Street proved unfounded. And
a closer look at the recent role of Japanese money in
American markets suggests that, if anything, the Japanese
have had a stabilizing influence.
   For one thing, Japanese investors are by nature
conservative and reluctant to make rapid moves. Also, they,
as well as other investors, still view the U.S. as a safe
investment haven. "The world's mattress is right here in our
markets, and I don't see anything on the horizon that will
change that," says Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Moreover, many large Japanese institutions still respond
to the wishes of the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance.
In times of disruption in the U.S. market, such as October
1987 and October 1989, a few judiciously-placed phone calls
from the ministry can prove enormously helpful. "Most people
in this business are guessing that the Ministry helped the
U.S. market on Black Monday by requesting insurance funds and
trust banks to buy and support the market," says Ryuji
Konishi, general manager of financial engineering at the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
   Still, U.S. dependence on Japanese money remains
unsettling. Analysts say that a collapse of Japan's
staggeringly high land prices, for instance, could force
Japanese investors to bring their money home, with
devastating effects on the U.S. economy. Similarly, a
shattering earthquake in Tokyo, like the one in 1923, would
have "a major impact on the U.S.," according to a study by
Tokai Bank.
   "It's kind of scary for the U.S. to depend on Japan for
its capital," says Akio Mikuni, president of a bond-rating
firm in Tokyo. "It's quite dangerous for U.S. financing."
