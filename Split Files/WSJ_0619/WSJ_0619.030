   MEDINA, Ohio -- Many entrepreneurs dread selling their
businesses. They swap tales of business owners who sold their
companies, stayed on to run the enterprise for the buyer --
and then left in a huff as the new owners made life
miserable.
   But RPM Inc., a holding company here, has grown fast by
buying companies, retaining the former owners -- and keeping
them happy.

   In the past 24 years, RPM Chairman Thomas Sullivan enticed
25 business owners to sell their companies to him and run
them as divisions of his holding company. More surprisingly,
all of the former independent operators stayed, largely
because RPM let them retain much of their autonomy. The
owners who departed later did so only to retire.
   "I've sold them six companies and the principals are all
still there," says Connecticut business broker James Siebert.
"Usually, the principals get their money and leave."
   Adds Tony Rose, president of PCI Industries Inc., a
Riviera Beach, Fla., firm RPM acquired in 1986: "There's very
little interference. Four years after buying my company, it's
been just as they said."
   Not all of Mr. Sullivan's acquisitions worked out. Over
the years, RPM divested five firms, mostly small paint
manufacturers competing with larger concerns.
   In addition, some of the businesses RPM still owns have
legal problems. For instance, RPM's Mameco International Inc.
is negotiating with the Environmental Protection Agency to
clean up a liquid-waste site in Ohio. In a lawsuit filed in
the past year in circuit court in Brevard County, Fla., iron
workers at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station claimed injuries
from exposure to the company's paint products. RPM denied the
allegations.
   But overall, RPM's strategy of growing through
acquisitions has worked well. For the fiscal year ended May
31, 1989, RPM reported earnings of $24.2 million, nearly five
times the $5.1 million a decade earlier. Sales advanced to
$376.1 million from $101 million. Both earnings and sales
have risen for 42 consecutive years.
   RPM says retaining former owners has been central to this
success. Keeping an independent entrepreneur happy and
productive as an employee at a larger company isn't always
easy. But RPM shows how it can be done again and again.
   Mr. Sullivan negotiated RPM's first acquisition in 1966,
while a young manager at RPM, then a small chemical company
founded by his father, Frank. Thomas Sullivan and James
Karman, now RPM's president, took a traditional approach to
the troubled acquisition. Eager to revive the company, a
predecessor to RPM's Bondex International Inc., "we went to
St. Louis and fired literally everybody in the office,"
recalls Mr. Sullivan, now 53 years old. "I came back and told
my father what we did, and all hell broke loose." Some key
employees were rehired.
   Frank Sullivan told his son that acquisitions work best
when management comes with them. When the son succeeded his
father as chairman in 1971, he began buying dozens of small,
well-managed specialty-chemical companies. Most produce
mundane though profitable products, like waterproof sealants
and roofing materials.
   In courting owners, Mr. Sullivan negotiates acquisitions
personally, no matter how small they are. "You always have to
remember, regardless of its size, that an entrepreneur's
company is the most important thing in the world to him," he
says.
   When RPM finds a company it wants to buy, Mr. Sullivan
sometimes waits for years until its owner is ready to deal.
He met at least a dozen times from 1981 to 1984 with
Cleveland's Euclid Chemical Co. before its owner, Larry
Korach, decided to sell. When Mr. Korach did sell the
company, however, his son Jeff says he was so impressed with
Mr. Sullivan that he turned down a higher offer from a Swiss
firm.
   Even when acquisitions fall through unexpectedly, Mr.
Sullivan persists. In October 1987, after months of
negotiations that appeared to be going smoothly, the owners
of Baltimore's Chemical Specialties Mfg. Corp. broke off the
talks with RPM over terms of an escrow agreement. Robert
Hughes, one of the company's owners, doubted he'd ever hear
from RPM again.
   To Mr. Hughes's surprise, Mr. Sullivan wrote a letter that
December in an effort to reopen negotiations. He even sent
the entrepreneur a box of candy. The next year, Chemical
Specialties belonged to RPM.
   Keeping his entrepreneurs happy after they've signed on is
another task Mr. Sullivan emphasizes. He does it by
delivering on his promise of nearly total autonomy. Reports
of this independence naturally help attract other
acquisitions.
   Rather than relocate or merge the companies it acquires,
RPM almost always leaves them in place. As in many
acquisition arrangements, the former owners get a share of
their former firms' earnings.
   Decision-making, too, is highly decentralized, as the
meager growth of RPM's 14-person headquarters staff makes
clear. Since 1976, despite the purchase of over a dozen
firms, just two people were added.
   As operating-division presidents, RPM's entrepreneurs must
produce annual plans that headquarters refines and approves.
The process, beginning with a meeting in Florida, can be
tedious for previously freewheeling owners. But "once the
plan is written, we don't talk about these things again," Mr.
Karman says.
   RPM headquarters on occasion goes along even with things
that aren't in the plan. One time, for instance, Frank Pabis
decided to double production capacity of his Mohawk Finishing
Products Inc., the Amsterdam, N.Y., company that RPM acquired
in 1971. Mr. Pabis, who died in 1981, began constructing two
buildings at a cost of $1.5 million. The trouble was, says
Glenn Hornberger, Mohawk's current president, "he never
mentioned it to RPM."
   Mr. Karman learned about the plan when, during a phone
call to Mr. Pabis, he heard the rumbling of bulldozers in the
background. "We need two more buildings and we're building
them," Mr. Hornberger recalls his boss saying in response to
Mr. Karman's startled inquiry. "What do you want me to do?
Tear them down?"
   Mr. Sullivan reports that both are still standing today.
