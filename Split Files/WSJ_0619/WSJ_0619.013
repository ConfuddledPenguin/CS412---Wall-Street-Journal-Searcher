   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Arrow Automotive Industries Inc. said
its board voted to end discussions on a possible sale of the
company and elected Jim Osment to succeed Harry Holzwasser as
chief executive officer.
   Mr. Osment also is president of Arrow, and formerly served
as its chief operating officer. Mr. Holzwasser will continue
in the post of chairman.

   The company said it was terminating its engagement of
Tucker, Anthony Inc., which was hired in March to pursue
strategic and financing alternatives, including a possible
sale. The hiring of Tucker was linked to the expiration of
secured financing arrangements at that time. Arrow announced
that it obtained replacement financing earlier this month.
