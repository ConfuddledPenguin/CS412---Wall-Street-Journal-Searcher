   I appreciated the concerns expressed in your May 7
editorial "Crack, Murder and Miranda." As a police officer, I
have experienced firsthand the impact of the exclusionary
rule. Culpable defendants do indeed walk away laughing while
bewildered victims are left wondering why our courts are
known as part of the "justice system." I must disagree,
however, with your conclusion that law-enforcement officers
themselves should be victimized by "lawsuits, fines, pay cuts
and removal from the force" if they violate the labyrinthine
rules surrounding search and seizure.
   The body of law surrounding Fourth and Fifth Amendment
rights is voluminous and constantly evolving. The justices of
the Supreme Court rarely reach unanimity on any issue, and
many of the court's landmark search-and-seizure cases have
been decided by split votes of 5-4 or 6-3. Professional
police officers, however conscientious, find it difficult to
stay abreast of the latest decisions. If the most learned
jurists in our nation cannot agree what the law should be
after months of careful deliberation, can we expect a
policeman on a dark street at midnight to choose the right
course every time? Can we fine, sue or dismiss him if he
turns out to be wrong?

   Police officers are sworn to protect the constitutional
rights of all people, including criminals. The vast majority
of officers would support sanctions against those few who
abuse their authority. They would also support a
simplification of the laws surrounding individual rights, so
that their decisions can be based on clear-cut precedents. If
an officer who errs in good faith is punished as the Journal
has suggested, the nation will quickly find itself without
anyone willing to fight in the front lines of the war on
drugs.
