   The setbacks sent Silk stock tumbling to $2.125 a share,
down $1.125, in national over-the-counter trading.
   The company -- which sells artificial trees, flowers and
plants -- said its loss totaled $5.7 million, or 60 cents a
share. That compares with earnings of $360,000, or four cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 74% to $27.5 million from
$15.8 million.
   The company cited significant increases in all major
categories of expenses.
   To cut costs, the company said several hundred workers had
been released, both through attrition and dismissals. Eighty
employees were idled at corporate headquarters.
   Chairman and President Jere L. Bradwell said salaries of
several top executives, including his own, had been sharply
reduced. The company declined to elaborate on its loss, the
staff cuts or its outlook.
   Silk also said John Stokely, its chief financial officer,
who had joined the company only last month, had resigned for
personal reasons. Moreover, two outside directors resigned,
also for personal reasons.
