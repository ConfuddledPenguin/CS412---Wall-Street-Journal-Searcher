   NEW ORLEANS -- Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said it reached
agreement with two U.S.S.R. agencies to create a joint
venture to construct and operate Soviet sulfur-exporting
facilities on the Black Sea.
   Terms weren't disclosed, although a spokesman for the
energy concern said the transaction "will have a substantial
impact on our company."

<TEXT>
   The agreement reached between Freeport-McMoRan and the
U.S.S.R. State Association Agrokhim and the U.S.S.R. State
Concern Gazprom calls for the company to act, with certain
exceptions, as the venture's sole marketing agent for sulfur
exports from the Soviet Union. Freeport-McMoRan said it will
arrange project financing for the venture, which would be
owned 60% by the Soviets and 40% by the company.
   Facilities to be constructed as part of the project
include a sulfur granulation, transportation, storage and
terminal system with an initial capacity of 1.5 million
metric tons a year of liquid and solid sulfur.
