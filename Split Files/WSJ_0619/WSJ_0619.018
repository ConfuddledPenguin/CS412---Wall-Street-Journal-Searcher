   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa's trade surplus
widened to 1.08 billion rand ($404.9 million) in May from 333
million rand a year earlier and from 969 million rand in
April, the government's Customs and Excise Office said.
   The figures aren't seasonally adjusted, but export and
import data are adjusted to bring them in line with the
requirements for compiling the nation's balance of payments.

   May exports totaled 4.69 billion rand, compared with 4.46
billion rand a year earlier, and imports amounted to 3.6
billion rand, compared with 4.13 billion rand.
   In the first five months of this year, exports amounted to
23.71 billion rand, compared with 21.93 billion rand a year
earlier, and imports totaled 17.62 billion rand, compared
with 17.8 billion rand.
   The trade figures include South Africa's exports of gold
bullion, the country's principal source of foreign exchange
earnings. Imports include the country's purchases of oil and
other petroleum products, despite the longstanding embargo of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
