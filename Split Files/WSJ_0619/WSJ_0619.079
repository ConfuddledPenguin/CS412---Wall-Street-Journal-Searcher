   WASHINGTON -- First Executive Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, Fred Carr, sparred for three hours with a
House panel in what apparently was an effort by lawmakers to
get him on the record for future testimony by junk-bond king
Michael Milken.
   Mr. Carr was grilled about his relationships with Mr.
Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier who
this year pleaded guilty to six felony counts. Oversight and
Investigations Subcommittee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich)
also asked Mr. Carr a series of specific questions about
First Executive's relationship with convicted arbitrager Ivan
Boesky and others.

   Messrs. Milken and Boesky are likely to appear before the
subcommittee later this year in its probe of the junk-bond
industry.
   But Mr. Carr, adding phrases such as "I'm not certain but
. . ." or "I believe," parried the assaults and offered
repeated arguments for junk bonds and First Executive's
investment strategy. "I believe that in the long-term . . .
our investment strategy will be proven to be sound," he said.
First Executive holds billions of dollars of junk bonds and
has aggressively built its business using the high-yield,
high-risk securities.
   The responses didn't appear to sit well with Rep. Dingell,
who wanted specific answers to questions about First
Executive's relationship to First Stratford Corp., a
Delaware-based reinsurance company that is partly owned by
Mr. Milken. First Executive owns 46% of First Stratford, as
does a company controlled by Mr. Milken.
   Mr. Carr told the panel that he remembered no conversation
later than 1981 with Mr. Milken about reinsurance, which
allows insurance companies to transfer risk to a third party.
"Don't people wonder who they're getting in bed with?" Mr.
Dingell asked, adding that First Stratford holders must be
"remarkably trusting and happy people."
   Then Mr. Dingell led Mr. Carr through a series of
questions about Fischbach Corp., Stone Container Corp. and
Harris Graphics Corp. All three have been linked to Mr.
Boesky and Mr. Milken, and First Executive has invested in
the three companies. Mr. Carr patiently answered the queries,
contending in part that "I have never received any assurances
or guarantees from Mr. Milken" on any of the deals.
   Mr. Carr insisted that Mr. Milken was never involved in
any investment decisions of First Executive. Instead, Mr.
Carr explained that the company invested in junk bonds
because of their higher returns that more than compensated
for a higher default rate.
   Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said "there seems to be two
worlds at First Executive -- one for {executives} and the
other for policyholders." He cited a contract that Mr. Carr
recently received that includes a provision that would pay
the executive $6 million if he leaves because of a change of
control within three years.
