   TOKYO -- Some Americans fear that Japan won't live up to
promises it has made in trade talks. Others fear that it
will.
   The U.S., in negotiations slated to end by early next
month, is pushing Japan to better arm its relatively weak
trustbusters, hoping to smash collusive practices that
allegedly block newcomers from the Japanese market. The good
news is that Japan's Fair Trade Commission is cracking more
heads. The bad news is that foreign firms are prime targets.

   On June 11, the trade commission issued a report on some
large gaps in prices among Tokyo, New York, London, Paris and
Frankfurt that concluded that U.S. and European importers and
their agents are keeping prices up and forcing their Japanese
retailers to do the same. The commission said it will use the
report to issue new guidelines and will "deal strictly" with
abuses discovered.
   This month, the commission raided 14 Japanese offices of
Master Foods K.K., a subsidiary of Mars Inc., McLean, Va. The
Japanese government is investigating charges that the U.S.
firm threatened to cut off supplies of pet food to retailers
and wholesalers offering discounts. Master Foods, in a letter
to its distributors, denied the charges.
   Last October, the trade commission searched the files of
Apple Computer Co. and its Japanese distributor, Canon Sales
Co., amid allegations there had been pressure put on four
computer magazines to suspend ads from independent importers
selling PCs at a discount. The case is still under
investigation, and Apple has denied the charges.
   Some Americans think the moves are intentional. "There's
very definitely a tribal mentality," says William Best,
director of the Tokyo office of A.T. Kearney International
Inc., a U.S. consulting company. "There's still very much an
interest in trying to place the blame on the outsider."
   "There's nothing like that," counters Tsutomu Yamada,
deputy director of the Fair Trade Commission's general
affairs division. He says the commission is conducting more
investigations in general and that "just by chance" some
foreign firms get caught in the dragnet. Most of the
commission's investigations aren't publicized, and Mr. Yamada
declined to say what percentage involve foreign-based
companies.
   In the year ended March 31, the commission handled 270
cases, 50% more than the year before. Three days after the
Master Foods case, the group launched a potentially
far-reaching investigation into Japan's cement industry for
allegedly setting up an illegal cartel. Also, as part of its
U.S.-instigated reforms, the commission is setting up a
special section to handle complaints from foreign firms.
   On the books, Japan's antitrust laws are officially the
same as in the U.S., but the application is different. From
1985 to 1988, according to a U.S. Justice Department study,
the U.S. government found fault in 30% of the cases it
investigated, while the Japanese government took action in
only 5% of its cases. The average fine in the U.S. was eight
times as large as in Japan.
   Japan's relatively lax antitrust enforcement is one of
several issues under discussion in the Structural Impediments
Initiative, the term given to current bilateral negotiations
on how to trim the $49 billion U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance.
   A fundamental U.S. philosophy in the talks is that prices
are higher in Japan than in the rest of the industrialized
world. In the U.S. view, this proves that Japan's is
essentially a less competitive market.
   The Japanese, however, are increasingly sensitive to
assertions they are anything but a normal free-market
economy. Last September, shortly after the talks began, the
Japanese government produced a study concluding that prices
were higher in the U.S. than in Japan. The U.S. poked holes
in the methodology, and the two sides did a joint study.
Two-thirds of the 122 goods examined cost more in Japan. Of
those, half cost 50% more.
   In January, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry released its own study, which concluded that the
average profit-to-sales ratio of foreign companies in Japan
in 1988 was 6.8%, compared with 2.8% for Japanese firms.
   Some foreign government and business officials concede
that they use higher markups in Japan. In Japan,
"distributors, dealers, shops have always said that if an
imported product is the same price as Japanese products, it
will not sell," says Luciano Cohen, chairman of the Council
of the European Business Community in Japan. "They tell you
the price should be higher if you want to sell it."
   U.S. officials complain that the Japanese reports are
distorted, focusing on an unrepresentative sampling of
foreign companies, mainly importers of name brands and luxury
goods.
