   CINCINNATI -- Multi-Color Corp., citing greater than
expected costs in starting up two new facilities and reduced
orders, said it expects to post a loss for the first quarter
ending July 2.
   The label producer didn't specify the size of the loss. A
year earlier, Multi-Color earned $1.7 million, or 80 cents a
share, on sales of $61.9 million.

   The company said present orders have resumed a more normal
pattern, production has increased and backlogs have returned
to comfortable levels. As a result, earnings "will get back
on track in the second quarter," it predicted.
