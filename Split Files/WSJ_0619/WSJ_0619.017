   Another venerable British financial institution is on the
block.
   Henry Ansbacher Holdings PLC said a combined, controlling
61.6% stake in the merchant bank is being offered by Pargesa
Holding S.A. of Switzerland, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. of
Belgium and Banque Internationale a Luxembourg S.A. The 115.1
million-share holding, valued at #89.8 million ($153.5
million), is intended to be sold to a single buyer, Ansbacher
officials said. Under British takeover rules, any single
buyer of the Ansbacher stake also would have to make an offer
to holders of the remaining 38.4%.

   The announcement marks the latest in a series of offerings
of big stakes in British financial firms, as investors
reorganize their holdings following recent years of upheaval
in the City, London's financial district.
   In the biggest such shuffling, Willis Faber PLC, an
insurance services company, last year put up for sale its
substantial stake in Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, igniting a
bidding contest that ended with a friendly takeover of Morgan
Grenfell by Deutsche Bank of West Germany. In a smaller deal,
Bank of Yokohama Ltd. of Japan bought a controlling stake in
the merchant bank Guinness Mahon Holdings PLC. Several
British fund-management concerns have been taken over by
larger Continental European players in recent years.
   Some smaller investors that have stuck their toes in the
London markets are retrenching, as returns haven't reached
expectations. Meanwhile, bigger financial companies still are
acquiring British businesses in preparation for a unified
European Community financial market in 1992. Companies taking
a look at the Ansbacher stake are likely to include some
Continental European banks.
   The 61.6% stake "is more likely to go to a single buyer,"
Richard Fenhalls, Ansbacher's executive chairman, said. "Any
single buyer is likely to be a banking group who wants to
expand its presence in London prior to 1992."
   For Pargesa, the planned sale is the latest sign of
changed priorities, since groups led by Albert Frere, a
Belgian financier, and Paul Desmarais Sr., chairman of Power
Corp. of Canada, tightened their control over the
Geneva-based holding company last February.
   Pargesa has been trying to simplify its structure and
extricate itself from a series of financial investments in
the 1980s that have turned out to be strategic dead ends. The
company recently agreed to sell its stake in Cie. Financiere
de Paribas's Swiss unit back to the French investment banking
concern, and has been retrenching to its core financial
activities in Continental Europe.
   When it acquired control of Ansbacher in 1984, Pargesa was
trying to build itself up as a global merchant-banking
powerhouse. Since then, Pargesa has scaled its ambitions
down, and Mr. Frere, the financier, has indicated he wishes
to concentrate on investments in Continental Europe. A
Pargesa spokesman said the concern has become less wedded to
the idea of holding stakes for the long term.
   Pargesa's 1989 profit dropped to 4.6 million Swiss francs
($3.2 million) from a record 160.2 million francs in 1988.
The drop reflected a 200 million-franc write-off of Pargesa's
indirect stake in Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., the U.S.
securities firm, which collapsed in February. For 1990,
Pargesa has forecast its net income will rebound to exceed
the 1988 level.
   Mr. Fenhalls, the Ansbacher official, said that neither
the British publisher Robert Maxwell, whose interests own a
9.94% Ansbacher stake, nor the Kuwaiti financial investment
company Wafra Intervest Corp., which controls 11.6%, is
likely to enter the bidding fray.
   But it wasn't clear which names will be attracted to
Ansbacher's particular mix of businesses, which include
international banking, merchant banking and a highflying
media-merger practice. Chris Wheeler, a London-based analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said initial interest may
come from the "same names" that previously looked at British
financial acquisitions, including several Japanese and French
banks. But it was far from clear which institution will find
Ansbacher a strategic fit.
   On London's stock exchange late yesterday, Ansbacher
shares closed at 78 pence, unchanged.
