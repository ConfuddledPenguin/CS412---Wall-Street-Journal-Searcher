   U.S. newspapers may go the way of the dinosaur unless they
can reverse shrinking advertising volume and sagging
readership. But the industry thinks regional ad networks
could offer an answer.
   More papers big and small are forging such alliances,
hoping to lure big-spending advertisers away from direct
mail, local TV stations and glossy regional magazines. The
networks usually represent either daily or weekly papers
without other business ties. They offer wider population
coverage plus the convenience of one-stop shopping -- often
with a discount -- simpler billing and standardized ad copy.

   There are now about 200 formal networks across the nation,
twice the number of a decade ago, estimates Herb Partridge,
vice president for sales development at Landon Associates, a
New York firm that handles newspaper advertising. New ad
networks have sprung up in a half-dozen states in recent
months, including New Jersey, California and Massachusetts.
Perhaps the largest is Newspapers First, the result of last
June's merger of networks representing 37 major city dailies
and run by Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror units.
   "I get calls all the time from newspapers around the
country asking for assistance to set one up," says Sandra
Daugherty, manager of the Florida Advertising Network, a
federation created by 19 daily papers last April that claims
to be the first statewide network.
   "There's going to be a proliferation of these networks,"
concurs Jim Wilson, senior vice president of national sales
at the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. "It's simply Marketing
101. We are all trying to get closer to our clients" --
something that newspapers didn't need to do, he adds, when
"we were the only game in town."
   Critics say newspapers command less of the total
advertising pie and fewer national ad dollars these days
partly because they didn't become aggressive marketers as
quickly as rival media outlets. Only 11.4% of newspapers'
$32.4 billion in advertising came from national marketers
last year, down from a peak of about 25% two decades ago.
   The spread of ad networks should help newspapers survive,
"but I don't think the one or two steps taken so far will be
the sole solution to their problems," says Robert Coen,
senior vice president and director of forecasting at
McCann-Erickson.
   Certainly that's been the experience of the Chicago
Sun-Times. Trying to overcome the Chicago Tribune's market
dominance and demographic advantage, Sun-Times Co. formed a
network last year that provides cut-rate space in both the
daily and its two chains of 65 suburban weeklies. A prime
goal: attract new major advertisers.
   The ad network has scored some modest successes. New
business accounted for 45% of its almost $5 million in
revenue during the first year. The newcomers, says Mike
Dacey, Sun-Times's senior vice president of advertising, are
"everything from bridal shops to a guy doing swimming pools."
   Not exactly your heavy-duty ad spenders, however. Mr.
Dacey concedes that few national advertisers have signed up.
"Some of their resistance is centered on the suburban
papers," he says. "They haven't traditionally used them."
Weeklies just aren't viewed as serious publications, other
industry watchers say.
   Dale Buchtel, a Sears Roebuck media buyer, says an ad
network like the Sun-Times's "is nice for small regional
advertisers. But we're a very large national advertiser. I
don't see anything advantageous for us." The retailing giant
runs ads in nearly 1,000 American newspapers every day, and
prefers to deal with each one separately.
   Undaunted, the Sun-Times plans to promote the network with
a nearly $500,000 print and direct-mail campaign starting
this month. Mr. Dacey will bolster the drive with a road show
for ad agencies in several big cities this fall.
   Yet even if newspaper advertising alliances figure out how
to woo a slew of national advertisers, they could face a more
formidable hurdle: the U.S. government. Earlier this summer,
the Justice Department disclosed an investigation as to
whether the Florida network engages in price-fixing. "We are
looking to see whether they are eliminating competition for
advertising" by making it harder for clients to get lower
rates from non-member papers, says Joseph Krovisky, an agency
spokesman.
   Ms. Daugherty of the Orlando-based network denies the
charges. "We feel we can be very competitive and are
responding to advertisers' needs," she says. She insists the
inquiry isn't hurting sales -- even though the network so far
has won only two clients and $100,000 in ads. The manager
suspects the government targeted Florida because it's the
sole statewide network.
   Not so, Mr. Krovisky retorts. The Justice Department just
didn't know there were newspaper advertising networks
elsewhere. Now, he adds, "I couldn't rule out that we
wouldn't investigate" the rest.

   Bunny at the Movies
                                                                                                       

   The Energizer Bunny is marching onto the big screen, this
time to interrupt a preview parody for a fictitious French
film.
   Near the end of the 60-second trailer, titled "Dance With
Your Feet," the bunny barges in on a romantic interlude
between a ballet dancer and her lover. An announcer then
comes on to plug Energizer batteries, which are made by
Ralston Purina's Eveready unit.
   The commercial will run from Sept. 21 to Oct. 18 in movie
theaters nationwide.
   Chiat/Day/Mojo, the agency that created the ad, has also
developed new bunny ads for TV, including parody spots for
"Chug-A-Cherry" soda and "Airdale" air freshener.

   AYER: Jerry Siano, chairman of Ayer, acknowledged that the
shop has had conversations with agencies interested in
acquiring a minority stake or putting together a joint
venture with Ayer. But he denied an Advertising Age report
that Dentsu plans to buy a 40% stake in the agency. He did
say Ayer and Dentsu had previously discussed a joint venture
in Asia, but he declined to comment on whether Ayer and
Dentsu might link in the future. "We have no specific deal
that is being struck at this point," he said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW CAMPAIGN: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, fearful a
recession could hurt membership recruitment, today begins its
first institutional ad campaign in 25 years. Ads in the $1
million campaign will appear in business newspapers and news
magazines. The ads were prepared by Siddall, Matus &amp;
Coughter, Richmond, Va.
