   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter shares ended slightly ahead
despite a late afternoon sell-off sparked by financial-market
rumors of increased tension in the Mideast.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.35 to 381.73, a 0.4%
gain, after being up more than four points before rumors of
escalating conflict in the Mideast squashed investors'
enthusiasm.

   Volume was a light 98.3 million shares, down from 103.2
million Friday; advancing stocks outpaced declining shares,
966 to 891. The 91 stocks posting new lows exceeded the 24
reaching new highs, a gap somewhat narrower than the vast
differences of recent days.
   "Paralyzed is the word," said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., explaining that
many investors are steering clear of stocks in the absence of
any major developments in the Persian Gulf or on the economic
front.
   "There's a greater fear of being wrong than of being
late," he said. Some money managers think there is little
room for error if the market drops but plenty of time to step
in and buy stocks if the market recovers, he said.
   Small investors are just about absent from the market,
agreed Mr. Costanza and Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at
Kidder Peabody. Postponement of new issues because of the
market's weakness also contributes to the lackluster trading,
Mr. Costanza added.
   Oracle Systems, the day's most active stock, rebounded 3/8
to 8 1/2. The software maker's shares had skidded 1 3/4
Friday after Oracle said it expected to report its first
quarterly loss ever. Among other technology stocks, Intel
rose 3/4 to 32 1/2, Conner Peripherals added 1 1/4 to 23 1/2,
Sun Microsystems advanced 1 1/4 to 29 5/8 and Novell rose 1/4
to 26.
   Sun appeared yesterday at a Cowen &amp; Co. conference in
Boston; Intel and Novell are scheduled to appear today.
   Also higher were shares of a number of companies scheduled
to appear yesterday at Montgomery Securities' 20th annual
investor conference in San Francisco.
   Aldus jumped 7/8 to 28 3/4; Pyramid Technology added 3/4
to 21 1/4; Medical Care International rose 1 1/2 to 39 1/4;
Good Guys advanced 3/4 to 21; Software Toolworks gained 1/4
to 11 1/8; HealthCare Compare climbed 1 to 24; Laserscope
rose 1/2 to 25 1/4; Teradata added 1/2 to 21 1/2; Chiron
advanced 5/8 to 38; Vicorp Restaurants gained 1/4 to 23 3/4
and Network Systems rose 1/4 to 9 3/4.
   Shares of health maintenance organizations got a boost
after Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood analyst Bernard McDonagh
repeated "buy" recommendations on United Healthcare and U.S.
HealthCare. United Healthcare jumped 1 3/8 to 18 1/4 and U.S.
Healthcare gained 1 1/8 to 21 1/8. Also higher were FHP
International, which rose 1/4 to 14 3/4, and PacifiCare
Health Systems, which edged up 1/8 to 16 1/8.
   Mr. McDonagh told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
that the two companies he recommended have the least exposure
among HMOs to fluctuations in Medicare reimbursement. DJPIR
reported that a government news release mailed yesterday to
HMOs explains that 1991 Medicare reimbursement rates will be
an average 1.4% higher than 1990, excluding last year's
one-time increase for catastrophic health care. Mr. McDonagh
said the relatively slim increase isn't a surprise.
   Optical Radiation climbed 1 1/8 to 30 3/4 after the Azusa,
Calif., supplier of devices for eye procedures reported that
profit from continuing operations for the fourth quarter
ended July 28 rose to 58 cents a share from 55 cents a year
earlier.
   Amgen, a biotechnology concern and an OTC leader, jumped 1
1/4 to 46. But Cetus, an Emeryville, Calif., biotech company,
fell 1/4 to 7 1/4 after Erbamont Inc. filed a patent
infringement suit against Cetus.
   CompuChem leaped 1 1/4 to 6 1/2 after the North Carolina
provider of drug testing and other testing services said it
won a five-year drug-testing contract worth $8 million to $10
million from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   Nu-Med added 7/16 to 3 1/8. Late Friday, HPB Associates
L.P., an investor group with a 9.89% stake in the Encino,
Calif., provider of health care management services, said it
is seeking seats on Nu-Med's board. The group said another
shareholder, Allen Holding Inc., which has a 9.5% stake in
Nu-Med, supports its plan.
   MCI Communications rose 3/8 to 34 1/8. The Australian
government called for a new telecommunications company to
compete with government-owned Telecom. Analysts say MCI is
one of several U.S. telecommunications concerns that might be
interested in taking a stake in a new Australian company.
Separately, MCI announced it won a three-year, $12-million
contract to provide service to Neiman Marcus's U.S. stores.
The Nasdaq Utility Index, of which MCI is the largest stock,
rose 3.71 to 513.58.
   Paychex added 3/4 to 15 3/4 after a two-point rise Friday.
Morgan Stanley analyst L. Keith Mullins told DJPIR that
investors are expecting the Rochester, N.Y., provider of
payroll accounting services will turn in a favorable first
quarter earnings report after a series of disappointing
quarterly earnings announcements.
   Favorable profiles in this week's edition of Barron's
magazine triggered gains in Healthdyne and Mentor.
   Healthdyne, a Marietta, Ga., provider of home-healthcare
services, added 3/8 to 13 1/4. Mentor, a Santa Barbara,
Calif., maker of medical devices gained 5/8 to 17.
   Among the day's losers, First Financial Bancorp plunged 4
1/4 to 33. Late Friday, the Monroe, Ohio, bank holding
company said that it would take a $4.5 million charge against
1990 earnings to cover loan losses at its First National Bank
of Southwestern Ohio. In 1989, First Financial had net income
of $15.2 million, or $3.01 a share.
