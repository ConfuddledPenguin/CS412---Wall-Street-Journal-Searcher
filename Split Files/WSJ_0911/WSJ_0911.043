   LONDON -- Retail sales volume in August fell a provisional
1.6% from July but rose 0.5% from August 1989, the Central
Statistical Office said.
   In the three months through August, retail sales volume
fell 0.9% from the previous three months but rose 1.4% from a
year earlier.

   The agency, in its standard warning about the volatility
of the monthly series, said the three-month figures give a
better indication of the trend.
   The government also said that prices of manufactured goods
in August rose 0.2% from July, and that producer input
prices, or prices of raw materials and fuels purchased by the
manufacturing industry, rose an unadjusted 0.8%.
