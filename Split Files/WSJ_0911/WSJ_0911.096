   My lily inventory gets done during high summer, an August
day with liliums nodding off all through the garden. (Not
counted are all the garden's misliliums: day lilies, calla
lilies, trout lilies, etc.) Despite a 10-year lily binge, and
the reliable summer reappearance of Enchantment, Imperial
Gold, Black Dragon, Pink Perfection and dozens of others --
I'm still short liliums. And so, each fall I order more,
thinking with thanks of Jan de Graaff (lily trademarked
JAGRA), the lily's 20th-century impresario.
   During the 40 years to 1970 that he was proprietor of the
Oregon Bulb Farms, Mr. de Graaff, who died last year at 86,
went about inventing the modern business of lilies, those
easygoing garden hybrids that Everygardener now grows as a
matter of course. By systematically building tough lilies --
indifferent to abuse and neglect, wonderfully showy but
virtually gardenerproof -- JAGRA made lilies ("the garden
Cinderellas" by his reckoning) that had hitherto owned the
rep of regally troublesome, demanding, finicky garden prima
donnas into horto-democratic garden regulars, no-nonsense
plants like daffodils and tulips, plants for hoi polloi.

   Mr. de Graaff's modern lily hybrids fall into the much
touted no-maintenance category, and gardeners need not be
much concerned with their cultivation. Rather, great care
should be taken with the initial purchase, siting and
planting. Once felicitously situated -- provided they were
plump, zaftig bulbs to begin with -- lilies can be ignored
for years.
   JAGRA once summed up the ease of lilies: "Lilies need no
pruning, no constant spraying, no pinching and disbudding, no
mulching or mounding to survive the winter." Nevertheless,
over the course of 40 years in the lily patch (his massive
breeding program involved lily tryouts by casts of tens of
thousands and Mr. de Graaff became the Cecil B. DeMille of
lilies), JAGRA dropped occasional declaratives re what lilies
do look like, since even regular garden plants respond better
to a little TLC. For those who would do well by the lilies of
their fields, herewith a culling of Jan de Graaff's Basic
Lily Observances:
   -- "The natural and preferable time for planting lily
bulbs is in the fall," Mr. de Graaff believed (in extremis;
earliest spring is just barely permissible); plant liliums in
a sunny, sloping spot (if possible) or in a raised bed.
   -- Except for the Madonna Lily (with its shallow
preference), plant the big bulbs fairly deep, covering with
4-6 inches soil.
   -- Sharp drainage sub-lily is an inviolable rule. Mr. de
Graaff once described a quick sonar soil-suitability test:
"If, when you plunge a spade into the soil, there is a faint
but quite audible grating sound, then, other things being
equal, lilies will like that soil."
   -- Open "air drainage" supra-lily is an absolute de
Graaffian requisite, "since stagnant air makes a breeding
place for fungus troubles."
   -- As to soil-type: neutral to slightly acid, friable,
fertile, humusy. At the most earthy level apply Mr. de
Graaff's Potato Rule: "Any soil that grows good potatoes
grows good lilies."
   -- Lime not lilies, as most are calcifuges -- serious lime
haters.
   -- Feed grossly these gross feeders: organic mulch,
compost, potash, phosphates, cottonseed meal, well-rotted cow
manure a la mulch, low-slow nitrogen.
   -- Deadhead but do not deadstem. Never, ever cut down a
lily stalk post-bloom. (IF compulsive garden tidiness is in
your character, don't grow lilies.) Await the natural
withering away of the leafstalk like a good Marxist gardener.
From the photosynthetic work of this year's leaves comes next
year's bloom and bust.
   -- Do not confuse your lilies] Mr. de Graaff's best
advice: "Leave lilies alone." He noted: "The true character
of the lily is that of a perennial plant which must be kept
moist and growing." He declared, "a healthy lily never
sleeps," and warned that a lily disturbed "may be thrown into
confusion."
