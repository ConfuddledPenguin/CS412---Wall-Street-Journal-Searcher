   TORONTO -- Last week's election victory by Ontario's New
Democratic Party may hurt Canada's chances of solving its
serious budgetary and constitutional problems, but not
because the New Democrats are socialists.
   Pollsters and political operatives widely view the
left-wing party's success as evidence of voter discontent
with the political establishment all over Canada. That's a
boon for third parties such as the NDP and for new regional
parties that want major changes in the country's
constitution.

   "People are fed up. People are willing to look at
something new," said Francois Gerin, one of seven members of
the Canadian Parliament who deserted their national parties
earlier this year to form a parliamentary bloc devoted to
Quebec independence.
   "This sense of disenchantment across the land is something
that any grass-roots protest party can do well from," said
Angus Reid, president of Angus Reid Associates Inc., a
polling concern. He said one of his recent polls found 40% of
the voters in the province of Alberta ready to vote for the
new Reform Party if a provincial election were held. The
three-year-old party wants to change the Canadian
constitution to give the western provinces more power.
   "The great danger is that we'll end up with almost an
Italian-style government, a government devoid of a leader,"
says Douglas Frith, a former federal cabinet minister. "That
would be a government unable to deal with our economic
agenda. By 1993 we'll probably have a national debt of 430
billion (Canadian) dollars (US$369 billion)."
   The New Democrats last week won 74 of the seats in
Ontario's 130-member parliament, which means they will form
the government of the province that accounts for more than
40% of Canada's economy. Although the party has ruled some
smaller provinces in the past, it never has governed Ontario.
   The New Democrats won only 38% of the popular vote, but
anti-establishment ballots amounted to about 44% when a
record-high vote by several fringe-parties is counted. The
ruling Liberals won only 33% of the popular vote. The other
traditional leading party, the Progressive Conservatives, won
about 24%.
   Pollsters say establishment politicians have never been as
mistrusted in Canada. Mr. Reid says Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney gets a 15% approval rating outside Quebec, "the
lowest I've seen in 15 years in this business."
   Much of the public anger stems from failure of the
political parties to reach a new constitutional arrangement
with Quebec early this summer. Mr. Mulroney and all 10
provincial premiers put the public through a long,
cliff-hanging political circus that resulted only in bad
tempers among both French and English Canadians.
   The federal government's inability to balance its budget,
a nationwide civil disobedience campaign by native Indians
and the proposed imposition of a widely unpopular value-added
tax have all added to a sense of governments that are either
powerless or unresponsive to the voters.
   The Ontario Liberals inflamed this sentiment when Liberal
Premier David Peterson called last week's election two years
before he had to, after polls showed his party would get 50%
of the popular vote and, therefore, a big majority in
parliament.
   Voters saw this as cynical manipulation, says Donna Dasko,
vice president of Environics Research Group Ltd., a polling
concern. "It was like he announced he was having a birthday
and invited people to send him presents," she says. Combined
with widespread cynicism about politicians in general, and
Mr. Peterson's prominent role in promoting the failed
agreement with Quebec, Liberal fortunes plunged.
   "How foolish do you think we are, to be taken in by this?"
voters asked Mr. Frith, the former cabinet minister, when he
tried to defend the election date while campaigning
door-to-door for his local Liberal candidate.
   Political observers see that attitude extending far beyond
Ontario and Mr. Peterson's election gaffe. "The Bloc
Quebecois (which seeks independence for Quebec) is just one
group that could benefit in the next election," says Ms.
Dasko. "The Reform Party in the West is very strong and I'd
expect them to do very well if this mood keeps up," she says.
   The splintering of Canadian politics could paralyze
efforts to deal with major issues that require cooperation
between the federal government and all the provinces.
   Quebec soon will come up with its own plan for changing
its relations with the rest of Canada and it's likely to be
less acceptable to English Canadians than the one that
failed. The Western provinces want a major political
reorganization to give themselves more federal power. No
solution to the government deficits is likely without
federal-provincial agreement on spending and tax revenue.
   Canadians currently are furious over government failure to
deal with the problems of native Indians, which have led to
Indian blockades of railroads, roads, bridges and even an
attempt to divert a river so that white farmers won't get
water.
   The blockades and white counter-demonstrations have
shocked Canadians with nightly television images of armed
troops, rioting mobs and Canadian police beating protesters.
"Canadians expect those things to happen in other countries,
and they get pretty unhappy when it's allowed to happen
here," says Bill Fox, a former spokesman for the Mulroney
government.
   Indian land claims can't be solved by any one government
because native rights are a federal responsibility in Canada,
but public lands mostly belong to the provinces. Feeble
governments at either level may make it harder to adopt a
common policy toward this latest crisis too.
