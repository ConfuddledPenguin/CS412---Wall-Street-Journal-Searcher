   WASHINGTON -- On Aug. 7, Ira Goldman, a top aide to Sen.
Pete Wilson, helped arrange for motion-picture czar Jack
Valenti and other Hollywood executives to meet with William
Barr, the Justice Department's newly installed deputy
attorney general.
   The meeting -- which Mr. Goldman not only helped set up
but also attended lest the Justice Department lose sight of
his boss's extraordinary interest in the matter -- went well
for the Hollywood lobby.

   It resulted in a re-evaluation of a department legal
position that would hurt the movie industry's battle against
the television networks to keep sole control of $3 billion a
year in television rerun sales.
   Thursday evening, the movie chieftains are rewarding Mr.
Goldman's boss, Sen. Wilson, handsomely for efforts on their
behalf. A Who's Who of Hollywood bigwigs will assemble at the
Bel Air home of Paramount Pictures Corp. Chairman Frank
Mancuso to raise money for Sen. Wilson's hotly contested
campaign for governor of California.
   The $1,000-a-couple cocktail reception could fatten the
Republican gubernatorial candidate's coffers by $250,000 or
more, according to several experienced Hollywood
fund-raisers.
   Among the 25 co-sponsors listed on the invitation: Walt
Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, Warner Bros. Inc.
Chairman Robert Daly, MCA Inc. President Sidney Sheinberg,
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Co-Chairman Peter Guber,
MGM/UA Communications Co. Chairman Kirk Kerkorian,
independent producer Stephen J. Cannell, and Mr. Valenti,
president of the powerful Motion Picture Association of
America.
   Sen. Wilson, who didn't respond to repeated inquiries
about the juxtaposition of the department meeting and the
fund-raiser, has long had a close relationship with the
motion-picture industry. Mr. Goldman says there is
"absolutely no connection" between the meeting and the
fund-raiser. "It's incredible that anyone would even suggest
that," he adds.
   But others say the meeting and subsequent fund-raiser are
a flagrant example of the way special-interest donors get
special favors and access from the lawmakers to whom they
contribute. "This is as bold a play for the special interests
that support a campaign that could possibly be made,"
contends Ellen Miller of the Center for Responsive Politics
in Washington.
   In the wake of the S&amp;L debacle, serious questions have
been raised about lawmakers' intervening for special-interest
constituents or financial supporters. There is often a thin
line between legitimate constituent representation and a quid
pro quo.
   Hollywood's Messrs. Valenti and Daly, who are among those
throwing Sen. Wilson's fund-raising bash, accompanied Mr.
Goldman to the meeting at the Justice Department. The meeting
came after the Justice Department had already staked out an
initial position against Hollywood on an arcane set of
regulations known as the Financial Interest and Syndication
Rules.
   Preservation of the rules, adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission two decades ago, is crucial to the
movie industry because they bar the television networks from
syndicating shows or sharing in the profits of hit television
series when reruns are sold to local TV stations. Most of
these series are produced by the major motion-picture
studios.
   In June, the department's antitrust chief, James Rill,
concluded in 37 pages of legal comments that the rules should
be eliminated, unless the FCC finds they protect the public
interest. Next year the FCC is expected to decide the issue,
which has pitted an alliance of major Hollywood studios and
independent producers against the television networks in a
decade-long lobbying war.
   Although the Justice Department took a similar stance in
1983, the Rill comments were a blow to Hollywood lobbyists,
who say the rules protect the producers and creators of
television shows from monopolistic practices of the TV
networks. With help from Sen. Wilson and his counsel, Mr.
Goldman, the motion-picture industry went over Mr. Rill's
head and appealed to the department's newly installed deputy
attorney general, Mr. Barr.
   Sen. Wilson began his lobbying of Mr. Barr even before he
was confirmed as deputy attorney general. "He made the
producers' case" during one of the Justice official's
courtesy calls on senators during the confirmation process,
recalls Mr. Barr. "I told him I would keep an open mind."
   Mr. Rill had issued his comments on June 14, before Mr.
Barr was confirmed. After the comments were released, Sen.
Wilson continued to lobby Mr. Barr by telephone. Then came
the Aug. 7 meeting with Mr. Goldman, Mr. Valenti, Mr. Daly
and a few other movie-industry representatives.
   Responding to the movie studios' entreaties, Mr. Barr
agreed to review the massive record in the case before
issuing further filings to the FCC. Since Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh is recused in the matter (he owns stock in
General Electric Co., the parent of the NBC network), Mr.
Barr holds the decision-making power.
   "There has been no untoward pressure. . . . Everything is
quite appropriate," says Mr. Barr, stressing that network
lawyers have lobbied him, too. Mr. Rill, too, says it is
appropriate for affected parties to ask for a second opinion
from a higher official.
   For his part, Mr. Goldman defends his and Sen. Wilson's
efforts to help the motion-picture industry as perfectly
proper. "If Sen. Wilson can't represent an entire industry
that employs tens of thousands of people in his state, we
might as well just shut the Congress down," he says. "We're
talking about an entire industry here, we're not talking
about doing a favor for one particular constituent where
other senators have run into problems."
   Mr. Goldman stresses that Sen. Wilson has been a vigorous
advocate for the motion-picture industry in the Financial
Interest and Syndication Rules battle since 1983 and has also
been Hollywood's advocate on other issues, helping to win key
provisions for the movie industry in the 1986 tax and 1988
trade bills.
   Since Sen. Wilson has also enjoyed Hollywood's financial
backing in previous campaigns, Mr. Goldman says there's
nothing unusual about Thursday's fund-raiser. "There's only
the coincidence of timing," adds William Hamilton, Sen.
Wilson's campaign press secretary. Invitations to the
fund-raiser were sent out Labor Day weekend, nearly four
weeks after the Aug. 7 meeting, according to one of the
event's organizers.
   Although there has been a traditional Democratic tilt to
Hollywood's largess (in July, the Hollywood community raised
$650,000 for House Democrats in Beverly Hills), the GOP's
Sen. Wilson has been an exception. While he received only
token support from Hollywood executives during his first
senate campaign in 1982, by his 1988 re-election drive Sen.
Wilson had become a studio favorite, in large part due to his
work on the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules fight.
   In 1988, he received $56,500 from the political-action
committees of movie studios lobbying to save the rules and
another $51,250 from individual studio executives involved in
the battle, according to federal Election Commission data.
   Sen. Wilson in 1988 received more financial support from
Hollywood studio interests than Democratic Senate candidate
Leo McCarthy. And this year, he is expected to vastly outdraw
Diane Feinstein, the Democratic candidate for governor.
Although the former San Francisco mayor is supported by some
Hollywood executives such as Fox Chairman Barry Diller and
has had Hollywood fund-raising events of her own, a Feinstein
campaign aide says she won't come near the level of support
Sen. Wilson enjoys.
   Several Hollywood fund-raisers said they expected studio
interests to pump more than a million dollars into Sen.
Wilson's gubernatorial campaign before the November election.
"Some will hedge their bets and go with Feinstein, too, but
the bulk will go to Wilson," said one well-known Democratic
fund-raiser.
   Timothy Boggs, a Time Warner Inc. vice president and
spokesman for Mr. Daly, says, "Pete Wilson has long been a
personal friend of Mr. Daly's and he's enjoyed the political
support of the studios for a long time." Mr. Boggs adds: "It
wasn't extraordinary in any regard that Sen. Wilson and his
staff assisted in the meeting with the Justice Department.
Since Mr. Barr was new to the subject, we were anxious for
him to understand the priority we place on the maintenance of
the rules."
   Mr. Valenti, the 69-year-old former adviser to President
Johnson whose lobbying skills and fund-raising prowess are
legendary in Washington, was traveling in Europe and couldn't
be reached. The MPAA's Barbara Dixon says Mr. Valenti isn't
even going to the Wilson fund-raiser, although he lent his
name to the invitation. "Pete Wilson has always been a
sympathetic listener to the industry," she adds.
