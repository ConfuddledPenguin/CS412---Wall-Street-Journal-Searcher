   Cetus Corp. said Erbamont Inc., Stamford, Conn., sued
Cetus, alleging patent infringement.
   Cetus, of Emeryville, Calif., said the suit was filed in
federal court in Cleveland. Cetus, a biotechnology company,
said Erbamont alleged that a Cetus joint venture's sales of
doxorubicin, a widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agent,
violates a patent held by a foreign subsidiary of Erbamont.
