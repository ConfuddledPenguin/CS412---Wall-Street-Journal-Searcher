   U.S. Instrument, with assets of $120 million, finances
general-purpose, chemical and analytical test equipment and
data equipment. Based in San Mateo, Calif., it has 280
employees with distribution centers in San Carlos, Calif.,
and Dallas.
   Thomas C. Wajnert, president and chief executive officer
of AT&amp;T Capital, said U.S. Instrument "will serve as the core
of a new line of business for AT&amp;T Capital."
   Separately, AT&amp;T said it began its Global Messaging
service in Canada. Canada is the fourth country where AT&amp;T
has introduced the facsimile and electronic mail service.
Although the portfolio of messaging services is a "relatively
small piece of the total communications market, the segment
promises dramatic growth in the coming years," AT&amp;T said.
