   LOS ANGELES -- Financial Corp. of America's bankruptcy
trustee has sued several federal government agencies for
allegedly causing the company to lose more than $1 billion
prior to the government's 1988 takeover of the company's
American Savings &amp; Loan Association subsidiary.
   Trustee David A. Gill's complaint, filed in federal court
here, also names as defendants 10 former officers and
directors of Financial Corp., including former Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer William Popejoy, for allegedly
mismanaging the company between September 1984 and September
1988.

   Mr. Popejoy, reached at his home in Orange County, Calif.,
said he hadn't seen the complaint and couldn't comment. Mr.
Popejoy is currently employed by an affiliate of Robert M.
Bass Group Inc., which purchased American Savings from the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in December 1988.
   Among other things, the complaint charges that the Bank
Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. had conflicts of interests
as American creditors when they forced Financial Corp. into
an operating agreement as a condition for future financial
advances in 1984.
   At that time, the regulators installed Mr. Popejoy and the
other directors at Financial Corp. and American Savings where
they allegedly followed agency orders rather than exercise
independent judgment. Since the agencies were creditors of
American Savings but not of Financial Corp., it was in their
interest to transfer assets to the thrift at less than fair
value, the complaint said.
   The allegedly improper transactions included the sale at
excessive discounts of millions of dollars in loans and real
estate by FCA Credit Corp. to American Savings and the
transfer of 1900 high desert lots, millions of dollars in
unexplained transfers from a Financial Corp. account at
American Savings, and the payment by American Savings of
below-market interest in the Financial Corp. account.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages.
