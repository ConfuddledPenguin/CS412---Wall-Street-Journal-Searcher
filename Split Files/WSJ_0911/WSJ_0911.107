based in Deerfield, Ill., now holds 500,000 shares in

   As previously reported, Baxter has said that it intends to
sell all or part of its investment in Genetics Institute and
that the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt.
   In making the announcement last month, Baxter said the
company has an "excellent working relationship" with Genetics
Institute. The two companies are involved in a joint effort
to develop and market a genetically engineered drug on which
Genetics Institute holds a patent. The drug is for
hemophilia, a hereditary condition in which one of the normal
blood-clotting factors is absent.
