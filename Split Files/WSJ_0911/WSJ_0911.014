   TOKYO -- The mood of detente that has swept much of the
world is starting to catch on in Asia. While the Middle East
confrontation dominates the headlines, Asia abounds with
examples of easing tensions.
   Yesterday, the warring factions in Cambodia agreed to
share power and let the United Nations supervise an end to
their 11-year civil war. A few days before, North and South
Korea -- still in a state of war that has lasted 40 years --
began a high-level dialogue. And in a related move, Japan's
icy relations with North Korea have begun to thaw. Even Tokyo
and Moscow are inching closer.

   "I think basically, without much hesitation at all, you
can say that things are getting better" in Asia, says Takashi
Inoguchi, a Tokyo University Asia specialist.
   It would be an exaggeration to say peace is breaking out
all over; the signs of detente remain tentative, and there is
no guarantee that any of them will lead to bigger things. But
the trend is hopeful, and that's a big change for a region
that stood out, prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as an
exception to the world-wide trend toward detente.
   Underlying everything is the end of the Cold War between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The two nations are still at
odds over reductions in naval forces in the Pacific -- Moscow
wants them, Washington doesn't -- but the change in their
relations was evident yesterday when a U.S. cruiser and
frigate tied up in Vladivostok, the Soviet navy's Pacific
home port -- something U.S. Navy ships haven't done in almost
half a century.
   The U.S. and the Soviet Union are now cooperating to push
a compromise in Cambodia. The two nations, with China, put
intense pressure on the four battling Cambodian factions,
leading them to agree on the composition of a U.N.-proposed
Supreme National Council. The council is a symbolic body that
would pass most of its powers to the U.N., which would
arrange elections, a halt to the fighting, and installation
of a new government.
   The agreement calls for a 12-member council, with six
seats held by the Vietnam-supported Cambodian government of
Premier Hun Sen, and two seats each by the three members of
the guerrilla resistance coalition, which is supported by
China and, until recently, the U.S. (The U.S. withdrew its
backing last month, saying it didn't want the Khmer Rouge to
govern Cambodia again, and agreed to begin talks with Vietnam
on the Cambodian problem.)
   The council, the Cambodian factions agreed, is to be
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, nominal head of the
guerrilla coalition, which is dominated by the militarily
more powerful, and feared, Khmer Rouge. A non-communist
member of the guerrilla coalition called the agreement a
"breakthrough," but diplomats warned against optimism. "It's
still in the balance," said one diplomat. "The Indonesians
(co-chairing the talks with France) certainly don't think
it's in the bag yet."
   Political movement on the Korean peninsula, where hundreds
of thousands of troops have faced off for decades, has been
helped by the Soviet Union's recent diplomatic flirtation
with South Korea, a staunch U.S. ally. Moscow has allowed
substantial increases in South Korean trade and is inching
toward diplomatic recognition of Seoul -- trends that make
North Korea more eager to improve ties with South Korea and
Japan.
   The North Korean and South Korean prime ministers met in
Seoul last week for the first time. They agreed to meet again
in Pyongyang next month, and to reopen talks on reuniting
separated families. But the fundamental differences dividing
North and South Korea are vast.
   Like East Germany, North Korea has been by far the less
successful economic half of a divided country. But unlike
East Germany, which was willing to accept capitalism to make
reunification with West Germany possible, North Korea seems
committed to its rigidly centralized Communist dictatorship.
   Only slightly less difficult are Japan's relations with
North Korea and the Soviet Union. The Soviets and the North
Koreans are eager for Japanese trade and investment, and both
are making their separate overtures. North Korea lacks
diplomatic ties with Japan, but has invited a senior
statesman of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shin
Kanemaru, to Pyongyang this month for talks.
   If the North Koreans free two Japanese seamen they have
held since 1983, further talks aimed at a broad improvement
in relations might go forward. But politicians helping
prepare Mr. Kanemaru's visit say North Korea's intentions
aren't clear.
   The big stumbling block between Tokyo and Moscow continues
to be the Soviets' refusal to give back four islands they
took after World War II. In a hopeful sign last week, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made clear the Soviet
Union's willingness to talk about the issue. In April,
President Mikhail Gorbachev had said the Soviet Union had "no
land to spare."
   But the Soviets have agreed to talk about the islands
before, and Mr. Shevardnadze didn't make any specific
promises. Soviet specialists in Tokyo believe the Soviet
leadership isn't likely to make up its mind until serious
preparations get under way for Mr. Gorbachev's scheduled
visit to Japan in April.
   Still, if anything is clear, it's the Soviet Union's
overall determination to improve its ties to Asia. In a
speech last week, Mr. Shevardnadze proposed "regional
negotiating institutions" to promote "broad-based dialogue"
on problems in the area. Though the little-noticed speech
lacked details and rehashed earlier proposals, it was
remarkable, says a Western diplomat, in its determination to
make Soviet Asian policy "keep step with" its European
advances."
   But the Western diplomat notes that while the Soviet
Union's East European allies have pushed Moscow to be more
forthcoming, it's far from clear how eager its Asian allies,
such as Kim Il Sung of North Korea, are to make progress.
