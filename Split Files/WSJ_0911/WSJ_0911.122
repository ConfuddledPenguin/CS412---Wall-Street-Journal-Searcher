   Corporate Data Sciences Inc. said its board declared
effective a spinoff to shareholders of Aril Group Inc. The
transaction is part of a restructuring of Corporate Data into
two separately traded companies.
   Corporate Data said its 22,119,256 Aril shares will be
distributed pro rata to Corporate Data shareholders of record
on Jan. 22, 1990, on the basis of 1.63 shares of Aril for
each Corporate Data share held. Corporate Data said its agent
would begin notifying shareholders immediately to make the
distribution.

   Corporate Data said it plans to continue its restructuring
through a merger with the company's 90%-owned subsidiary,
Consolidated Packaging Corp. After the merger, Corporate Data
said its shares will become shares of Consolidated Packaging,
a paper concern. Aril is a New York-based holding company
with kitchen-cabinet operations.
   The spinoff, originally set for January, was delayed
because of Securities and Exchange Commission "paper work"
and Aril's purchase from Corporate Data of the
kitchen-cabinet operations, Corporate Data said. In exchange
for those operations, Corporate Data received Aril shares
that boosted to 72% Corporate Data's stake in Aril.
