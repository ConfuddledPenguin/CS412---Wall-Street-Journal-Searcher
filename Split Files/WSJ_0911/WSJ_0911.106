   Michael Milken's supporters, including numerous industry
leaders, flooded a federal judge with letters seeking
leniency for the former junk bond king, who is scheduled to
be sentenced Oct. 1.
   Some 170 friends, relatives, former clients and colleagues
urged Judge Kimba Wood to treat Mr. Milken gently when doling
out penalties for the six securities fraud-related felonies
to which he pleaded guilty in April. Mr. Milken could draw as
much as 28 years in prison.

   Those who urged leniency include Steven J. Ross, chairman
and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc.; Armand
Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; Joseph Flom,
New York takeover lawyer; John Kluge, investor; Rosey Grier,
former football player, and Monty Hall, TV personality.
   Other writers included Roger Stone, chairman of Stone
Container Corp.; Peter Magowan, chairman of Safeway Stores
Inc., and Laurence Tisch, CBS Inc. chairman. Dozens of former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees who were hired by Mr.
Milken asked the judge to spare him a prison term. Letters
were also mailed by Mr. Milken's cousins, aunts, uncles,
neighbors and the headmaster of his children's school.
   Letters of support are routine in sentencings, but the
outpouring for Mr. Milken was unusually strong. This resulted
in part from an effort by Mr. Milken's attorneys to solicit
such support, according to one letter writer. But an
individual familiar with the matter said many of the letters,
especially from "regular guys" who knew Mr. Milken, weren't
solicited.
   A sampling:
   Mr. Ross said that Mr. Milken "is no Ivan Boesky or Martin
Siegel," who have pleaded guilty to crimes tied to
insider-trading, and that his offenses "are not
characteristic of his values."
   Mr. Hammer said Mr. Milken "led the charge which helped to
assure that American democracy could thrive."
   Mr. Flom said Mr. Milken "demonstrated great acumen and
punctilious concern for what was ethical." He added that he
doesn't condone the acts to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty,
but that "I can only assume that they were the result of his
preoccupation with his clients' interests," causing him to
overlook some rules.
   Mr. Kluge, who made much of his wealth with Mr. Milken's
assistance, told Judge Wood that Mr. Milken's commitment to
social causes "is genuine," while Mr. Tisch said Mr. Milken's
offenses were "out of character."
   Mr. Hall, chairman of a children's charity to which Mr.
Milken has donated in recent years, said he has never met Mr.
Milken's equal.
   Daryl E. Gates, the chief of police in Los Angeles, said
he met Mr. Milken only once "a few years ago." But Mr. Gates
recalls liking Mr. Milken and proposes that Mr. Milken be
sentenced to develop a domestic Peace Corp to help reform
U.S. inner cities.
   There was a handful of unsolicited letters that weren't so
favorable. Disque Deane, former chairman of Corporate
Property Investors, wrote that he was "shocked and surprised
at the leniency" of Mr. Milken's settlement and that Mr.
Milken shouldn't be sentenced to a "country club" type
prison. John R. Weigel, a Costa Mesa, Calif., analyst, wrote:
"Give the felon the maximum penalty allowable."
