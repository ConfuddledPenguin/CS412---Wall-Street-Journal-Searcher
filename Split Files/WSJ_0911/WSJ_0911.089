   FOXBORO, Mass. -- Moving quickly after completing its
$656.4 million acquisition of Foxboro Corp., Siebe PLC said
it plans to fire 1,600 Foxboro employees, or nearly 25% of
the work force.
   Foxboro, a maker of industrial controls, had been
unprofitable in three of the last five years. After the
company put itself up for sale earlier this year, Siebe, a
Windsor, U.K., engineering concern, won the bid at a price
that many analysts called surprisingly high.

   A Foxboro spokesman said that about 800 of the firings
will be among the 4,000 employees in Massachusetts, a state
already battered by downturns in high technology, defense and
construction. In addition, Siebe said that Gary K. Willis,
Foxboro president and chief executive officer, was fired.
   The remainder of the firings will be at Foxboro facilities
around the world, including one in England.
