   HONG KONG -- In addition to new regulations for its Pudong
industrial project, Shanghai announced rules allowing foreign
banks to operate bank branches and other financial
institutions in the city proper.
   Foreign bankers said that, while the scope of business may
be too restrictive to make operating a branch profitable, the
tough rules won't deter them from trying to gain a toehold in
Shanghai, an industrial and commercial center and former
regional financial center. Until now, Beijing has allowed
foreign banks to open branches only in the country's five
special economic zones.

   Four foreign banks -- Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.,
Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of East Asia and
Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp. -- already have Shanghai
branches, which they established before the Communist
takeover in 1949. This number will grow as the municipal
government is expected to approve the first batch of new
applicants soon.
