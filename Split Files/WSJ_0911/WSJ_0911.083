   HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. entered into
a marketing agreement with a Japanese company to sell
high-power laser systems in Japan, opening a major market for
this emerging technology.
   In recent years low-power lasers have been replacing
conventional tools for cutting sheet metal and welding. As
with many other technologies invented in the U.S., the
Japanese have been in the forefront in integrating lasers
into their manufacturing processes. The pact with a leading
developer of high-power lasers will "give them . . .
significant advantage" in their manufacturing costs, said
Edward Peters, who follows lasers at the consulting firm
Arthur D. Little Inc.

   High-power lasers can cut thicker materials and can weld
more precisely and at higher speeds than low-end lasers,
allowing significant manufacturing flexibility. The recently
commercialized technology hasn't attracted many takers in the
U.S., however. "The demand isn't as intense as in Japan and
Europe," said Jeffrey Carstens, general manager of United
Technologies Industrial Lasers. "That's one reason we want a
presence in Japan."
   Under the agreement, Hanwa Co. in Tokyo will market and
distribute United Technologies' carbon dioxide lasers, whose
powers will range between 10 and 25 kilowatts. Most lasers in
use in Japan produce less than one kilowatt, and the
highest-power laser available from Japanese companies is in
the 10-kilowatt range.
   In Japan, the market for industrial lasers was $200
million last year. "We expect the Japanese market for
high-power lasers to expand by over 400% in five years," said
Shigeru Kita, president of Hanwa.
   Mr. Carstens said that the lasers will be supplied from
the U.S. and that there are no plans for joint production
because of the size of the market. A five-kilowatt laser
costs $460,000. A 25-kilowatt version is priced at $1
million.
   Arthur D. Little's Mr. Peters said that laser applications
are also likely to get a major boost from European
manufacturers. Under a plant modernization program, European
Community members have singled out high-power lasers to
increase manufacturing efficiency and are spending tens of
millions of dollars on laser technology, he said.
   Mr. Peters estimated that the world market for industrial
lasers totaled $830 million in 1988, with Japan accounting
for 40% of all installed industrial lasers, the U.S. 33% and
Europe 27%. He said he expects the world market to grow 8% to
10% annually through 1994.
