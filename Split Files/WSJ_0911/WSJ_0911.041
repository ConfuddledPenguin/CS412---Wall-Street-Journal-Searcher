   PHILADELPHIA -- Westmoreland Coal Co. said it signed a
six-year extension of its contract to provide low-sulfur coal
to Appalachian Power Co., a unit of American Electric Power
Co.
   The new agreement extends an existing contract for
Westmoreland to supply about 600,000 tons of coal annually.
The extension begins Dec. 1, 1995.

   Although Westmoreland declined to place a value on the
contract, a spokesman said the coal will be delivered at
prices higher than current market base prices of $25 to $27 a
ton.
   American Electric is based in Columbus, Ohio.
