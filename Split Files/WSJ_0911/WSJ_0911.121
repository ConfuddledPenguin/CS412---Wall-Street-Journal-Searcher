   TINTON FALLS, N.J. -- Denis R. Brown, a specialist in
corporate turnarounds, was named president, chief executive
officer and vice chairman of Concurrent Computer Corp. as the
company undergoes a restructuring effort.
   Concurrent also named a director, Dean W. Freed, chairman.
Mr. Freed, 67 years old, had been chairman and chief
executive of EG&amp;G Inc., a provider of scientific products and
services in Wellesley, Mass.

   Mr. Brown, 51, succeeds James K. Sims, 44, who resigned
his three posts in the wake of the company's report Friday of
a net loss of $38 million, or $2.05 a share, for the fourth
quarter ended June 30. The results include a $24.2 million
restructuring provision.
   Mr. Brown said he will be "taking a good hard look" at
Concurrent's three segments, which supply computer systems to
commercial, technical and government clients. He formerly was
president and chief executive of Penn Central Industries
Group, a subsidiary of Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati.
   Mr. Sims, who presided at Concurrent from its inception in
1985 to its merger in 1988 with Massachusetts Computer Corp.,
had weathered a series of revenue losses in recent years.
Industry downturns and economic uncertainties resulted in a
previously announced near-20% reduction in the company's
world-wide workforce and several plant shutdowns.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Concurrent's common stock closed at 75 cents a share, down
12.5 cents.
