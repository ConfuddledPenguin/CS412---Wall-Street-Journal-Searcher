   I could not agree more with your Aug. 20 editorial on "Oil
Disarmament." Actually, things are worse than you think.
   I am a chemical-engineering consultant specializing in
developing new hydrocarbon manufacturing processes. Last
spring I cooperated with Lehigh University to respond to the
Department of Energy's solicitation of research proposals on
the kind of fuel technology that would make the U.S. less
dependent on oil. We are expecting to learn soon whether we
will get any award to carry out the research.

   This morning I called DOE to ask whether the Iraq crisis
has provided the department with new opportunities for
further research. My contact laughed. He said that, to the
contrary, he is concerned about the budget process leading to
a massive across-the-board cut. If the Gramm-Rudman ax falls,
many of the important research awards will not be announced
this fall.
   I had hoped that the current crisis would finally teach us
a lesson. I was wrong.

   Your editorial significantly overstated the alleged
potential of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
   According to Ronald Reagan's pro-development Interior
Department, which likely erred on the high side but has at
least some credibility:
   -- There is only a 19% chance of finding a commercially
viable oil field below the refuge's spectacular coastal
plain.
   -- If such a field were found, the most likely output (3.2
billion barrels) would satisfy just 2% of U.S. oil demand
over its productive life.
   -- There is only one chance in 100 that a field as large
as the one at Prudhoe Bay exists there.
   How can this generation justify tearing up "America's
Serengeti" to create a sprawling industrial-pollution factory
when a mere two-mile-per-gallon increase in the efficiency of
new U.S. cars would save more crude than the oil industry
hopes to find in that unique wildlife refuge?

   You tell of the U.S. oil reserves available in Alaska and
off the California coast, but you fail to mention the
Kettleman Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in Kern County here
in California.
   You will recall the pieces the Journal wrote back in the
'70s urging that the reserve be released. You pointed out
that Congress, as it usually does, would not listen to reason
and refused to act when release was definitely called for.
   The situation is even more urgent today. You would do the
nation a favor by publicizing the reserve's potential.
