   NEW YORK -- The yen overpowered all other currencies
yesterday as Japanese investors who had forsaken their home
market all year exchanged their foreign-currency profits into
yen.
   "Window dressing" was the talk of trading rooms as
insurance companies and other big institutions moved to
decorate their balance sheets before the close of a
particularly tough fiscal first half on Sept. 30.

   The biggest losers for the day were those currencies that
had recently been seen as attractive investments --
continental European currencies and "high-yielders," such as
the pound and the Canadian and Australian dollars, that are
backed by high domestic interest rates.
   Coming in second was the dollar, which rose against the
sold-off currencies because of its role as a medium for cross
transactions. For example, investors trading marks for yen
will often pass through dollars to take advantage of the
greater breadth of the dollar market.
   But the greenback also exhibited some independent strength
and ended global trading off only half a yen. The dollar was
pushed briefly below 139 yen, but bounced back after finding
support at 138.75 yen.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
139.55 yen, down from 140.05 yen late Friday in New York. But
the U.S. currency rose to 1.5820 marks and 1.3165 Swiss
francs from 1.5679 marks and 1.3055 francs in New York late
Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 140.23 yen, up from 139.43 yen at the close there Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5784
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.5710 marks.
   Sterling was trading at $1.8575, down from $1.8930 late
Friday. The Canadian dollar fell to 85.71 U.S. cents from
85.98 U.S. cents, while the Australian dollar slipped to
81.22 U.S. cents from 82.23 cents.
   At their recent peaks a little over two weeks ago, the
pound was only four cents shy of $2, while the Canadian and
Australian dollars were at 88.5 cents and 83.5 cents
respectively.
   The yen's performance yesterday was much stronger against
non-dollar currencies.
   For example, among continental European currencies, the
mark fell to 88.211 yen from 89.323 yen Friday. Among
high-yield currencies, the pound dropped to 259.21 yen from
265.11 yen late Friday.
   Kiyohiko Yoshizawa, a pound and yen trader for the U.K.'s
Midland Montagu in New York, said the market is seeing the
yen version of what happened to the dollar late last year.
   Following the New York Stock Exchange's minicrash last
October, Mr. Yoshizawa said, U.S. investors brought home
profits from foreign investments to cover their losses.
Accordingly, the dollar gained last fall.
   Japanese investors, he said, are following the same path
now, making up for devastating reversals on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange last spring and last month. "Major Japanese
investors must buy yen," Mr. Yoshizawa said. "They need yen
right now."
   Mr. Yoshizawa, agreeing with many traders in Asia, said
this will be the week when most cash will be brought home to
Japan. Companies face internal reporting deadlines that
precede the month-end close of the fiscal half, he said.
"This is the week of the real buying."
   Come Oct. 1, the yen may drop. Institutions have been
known to put their money right back where it was after the
close of the fiscal half.
   But the dollar's chances against the yen are threatened
not only by the prospect of a U.S. recession but by
credit-easing to ward off such a recession. Returning from a
whirlwind tour around the world to find financial support for
the U.S. military deployment in Saudia Arabia, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady repeated his oftstated opinion that
U.S. interest rates should be lower.
   Also working in the yen's favor is the general easing of
Persian Gulf tensions following the show of solidarity in
Helsinki by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Meanwhile, sentiment is split on the mark. Some German
technicians are pointing to a ceiling for the dollar at
1.5875 marks. "The dollar is near sell levels now" against
the mark, warned a Frankfurt dealer.
   But others aren't so sure. "It's looking bad for" the
mark, said Claus Wagner, chief trader at Citibank in
Frankfurt. "I really believe we've seen the worst for the
dollar. We've seen all the bad news. If a currency is going
to weaken, it's the mark."
   Ian Foakes, foreign-exchange manager at PaineWebber, noted
that the market is always uncomfortable with a weak dollar.
Because so many people have a finger in the U.S. pie, a weak
dollar and a weak U.S. economy are painful to everyone.
Foreign-exchange volume "really started to peter out" as the
dollar fell to its recent record low against the mark, he
said.
   The dollar ended European trading mostly higher. Dealers
said dollar activity was sparse, as the market's attention
had turned squarely on the yen.
   In Asian trading, the dollar ended mixed, as funds
continued to flow into the yen from European currencies. The
greenback was last quoted in Tokyo Monday at 139.43 yen, down
from 140.25 yen late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery plunged $10.90 to $378.60 an ounce. The close was
the lowest since Aug. 3. Estimated volume was a heavy five
million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $378.25 an ounce.
