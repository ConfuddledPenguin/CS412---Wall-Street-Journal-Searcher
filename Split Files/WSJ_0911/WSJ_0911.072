   Many Hotels to Install Room Sprinklers

   Congress passed a bill that in effect will force many
hotels to install sprinklers in rooms -- which only about
half of hotels currently do.
   The bill was passed yesterday despite heavy opposition
from some hotel chains, and industry experts predicted that
rates would eventually rise significantly. Although no
industrywide figures are available, the cost to install a
sprinkler system can be more than a $1,500 a room.

   "The impact on the hotel industry is going to be
terrible," said Randy Smith, president of Smith Travel
Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. "There's no question hotels
are going to have to try to pass this on to consumers."
   But supporters of the bill insisted the cost impact
wouldn't be quite so drastic, because hotels would save on
lower insurance rates. They also noted that more than 400
people have been killed in hotel fires in U.S. in the past
six years. "The U.S. has the worst rate of fire loss in the
industrialized world," said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a New
York Republican who sponsored the legislation.
   Currently, most states require the installation of
sprinkler systems and smoke detectors in new hotels. But only
a handful of states -- including Hawaii, Nevada,
Massachusetts and Florida -- require operators to install the
systems in existing hotels. Nearly all hotels have smoke
detectors, but only 48% of them have sprinklers, according to
a survey by the American Hotel and Motel Association.
   The bill doesn't directly force the installation of
sprinklers, because the federal government doesn't have that
kind of jurisdiction. Instead, it prohibits nearly all
federal travel to hotels that don't have sprinklers. Industry
officials say that should force many hotels to install the
safety equipment, because federal employees represent such a
huge market, spending about $1.5 billion a year on hotels.
   The legislation was stalled for nearly three years,
primarily by heavy lobbying by some hotels and by opposition
from the Reagan administration. President Bush, however, is
expected to sign the bill, which is weaker than the original
version. It exempts, for example, hotels that are three
stories or less and won't be fully phased in until 1996.
   Even in its weaker form, some industry experts say the
bill is going to hit many chains hard, because they won't be
able to pass on all the costs. The industry has been in a
slump for several years now because the market became too
glutted with new properties. With competition so fierce,
rates have risen only mariginally the past four years. This
year, they are expected to rise only 3% -- below inflation.
   The bill was passed last month by the Senate and approved
by voice vote yesterday in the House.
