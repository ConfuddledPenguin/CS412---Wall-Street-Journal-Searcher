   NEW YORK -- Rising oil prices and reports that
congressional negotiators are not even close to forging a
credible budget-reduction accord gave investors new reasons
to bail out of bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/2 point
lower, a loss of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, rose to 8.96% from 8.91% on Friday.

   Tax-exempt municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities
followed the Treasury market step-by-step.
   But junk bonds, ignoring the declines in the Treasury and
stock markets, posted gains of between 1/4 and 1/2 points.
   "Junk bonds moved up early with equities and somehow held
on to those advances despite a late-day sell off in the stock
market," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's
Investors Service Inc. He said the gains were exaggerated by
the extremely thin trading conditions.
   "I would not read too much in the way of substance," into
the junk bond rally, said Mr. Lonski. If oil prices remain
above $30 a barrel when the market opens today, he said, junk
bond prices are likely to fall.
   The broader bond market also opened higher yesterday. But
prices of Treasurys, municipals, investment-grade corporates
and many other fixed-income securities reversed directions on
disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not push
short-term interest rates lower and on talk that budget
negotiations have stalled.
   The talks are moving so slowly that President Bush
canceled a planned meeting yesterday morning with the budget
negotiators. Prior to that announcement, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady commented on ABC-TV that the budget talks "are
going nowhere fast."
   John Costas, co-head of government trading at First Boston
Corp., said investors reacted negatively to the news because
without a budget accord, the government will continue to
borrow heavily in the credit markets to finance its spending
habits.
   Some economists argue that the government's immense
borrowing needs are keeping interest rates relatively high.
Moreover, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said on numerous
occasions that he would cut interest rates if Congress and
the Administration significantly reduced the budget deficit.
   Without some agreement to reduce the deficit or alter the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, about $85 billion in
across-the-board spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1.
   Mr. Costas said news about the budget negotiations and
disappointment that the Fed failed to ease short-term rates
"softened up the market." But, he added, "the market
deterioration accelerated after the oil price increase."
   October crude oil futures settled at $31.30 a barrel, up
$1.26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Bond prices have been falling for weeks due to fears that
rising oil prices, a trend that was precipitated by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, will accelerate inflation. Rising prices
greatly reduce the appeal and attraction of fixed-income
securities.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Short-term interest rates were mixed at yesterday's weekly
government Treasury bill auction.
   The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.41%
and the average rate on six-month bills was 7.34%. The rate
on three-month bills was up from last week's auction when it
was 7.39%. But the rate on six-month bills was down from the
previous auction when it was 7.36%.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Sept. 13, 1990. The 13-week bills
mature Dec. 13, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature March 14,
1991.
   Meanwhile, prices of long and intermediate-term securities
were moderately lower.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at 97 23/32 to
yield 8.96% compared to Friday's price of 98 7/32 to yield
8.91%. Prices of two-year notes ended at 100 3/32 to yield
8.05%, the price was down from 100 7/32 to yield 7.98% on
Friday.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds, which have been the worst performing segment
of the bond market in recent weeks, were the only major
sector to post gains yesterday.
   Most of the high-yield, speculative-grade securities
finished between 1/4 to 1/2 point higher.
   Among the key gainers in the high-yield market were junk
bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. The tobacco and food company's
17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures finished up 1 3/4
points to 112 on the New York Stock Exchange after advancing
as high as 112 5/8 earlier. RJR's 17% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures ended one point higher 88 7/8.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended between 1/4 to 3/8 point lower. Among
new issues, a group led by Bear Stearns &amp; Co. won a $250
million issue of General Electric Capital Corp. three-year
notes. GE Capital is a unit of General Electric Co.
   The notes will be reoffered with an 8.45% coupon at a
price of 99.922 to yield 8.48%. Bear Stearns won the issue
with a bid of 99.753, which resulted in a net interest cost
to the company of 8.545%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were unchanged to 3/8 point lower in light
dealings.
   Among active bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue of 2018 slipped 3/8 point to 97 7/8, to yield 7.37%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The mortgage-securities market erased early moderate
gains.
   In the secondary mortgage securities market, Government
National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for September
delivery was down 14/32 at 98 14/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue for
September delivery was off 11/32 at 98 3/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for September delivery
was down 11/32 at 98 21/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Rising short-term interest rates caused the Japanese
government bond market to end weaker again despite a stronger
yen.
   The yield on December Euroyen interest rate futures was
8.69% yesterday, up from 8.60% on Friday. Rates on new
three-month certificates of deposit were 8.38%, up from
8.34%. Meanwhile, the dollar ended at 139.55 yen, down from
140.05 yen in late Friday in New York.
   In trading, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese bond
ended at a price of 82.42, down 0.04 points from Friday. The
yield rose to 8.26%. (When calculated using the semi-annual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.57%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   British and West German government bonds were moderately
higher.
