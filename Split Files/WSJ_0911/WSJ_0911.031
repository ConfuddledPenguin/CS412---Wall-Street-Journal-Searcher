Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, ordered the abolition of cartel-like
agreements in the country's banking industry.
   The long-awaited decision conforms to a request by the
country's cartel commission. The banking industry has
previously said it would appeal such a decision to the Swiss
Supreme Court.

   Mr. Delamuraz's move caps a long battle between the banks
and the commission over four cartel-like arrangements. The
decree became necessary after the banks and the commission
failed to agree on a solution.
   One of the four pacts deals with the syndicate of big
banks that dominates the underwriting of Swiss-franc bonds.
Mr. Delamuraz's order means that by the end of the year, the
banks must eliminate the so-called "loyalty" clause of the
convention, which prevents members from participating in
transactions outside the syndicate.
   Also at year end, the agreement setting minimum fees for
documentary credits must be abolished.
   Further, the decree orders the elimination by 1992 of the
convention that fixes fees on securities brokerage and of the
pact that governs commissions for custodial operations.
