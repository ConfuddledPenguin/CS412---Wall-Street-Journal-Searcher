   NOVATO, Calif. -- Software Toolworks Inc., a software
publisher, said it received a license from Tokyo-based
Nintendo Corp. to market Nintendo computer game cartridges in
Japan. Terms weren't disclosed.
   "There are currently over 15 million Nintendo
Entertainment System units in Japan, with relatively little
game cartridge penetration by Nintendo licensees," said Les
Crane, Software Toolworks chairman and chief executive
officer.
