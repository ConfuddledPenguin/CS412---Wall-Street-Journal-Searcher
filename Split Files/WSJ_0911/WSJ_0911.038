   BOSTON -- Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, who stood
up to Gov. Michael Dukakis in a palace coup, now is standing
down in the race for governor.
   The lieutenant governor, who was running a distant third
in next Tuesday's Democratic primary, dropped out of the race
yesterday and threw her support to former state Attorney
General Francis Bellotti. The latest polls showed Mr.
Bellotti ahead of John Silber, who is on leave from his
duties as president of Boston University.

   Ms. Murphy, who never enjoyed the confidence of Gov.
Dukakis, clashed with the 1988 Democratic presidential
nominee frequently, but their dispute flared into public
attention last week as Mr. Dukakis prepared to lead a state
trade mission to Germany.
   Mr. Dukakis didn't leave Massachusetts until he felt
assured that the lieutenant governor wouldn't take advantage
of her position as acting governor by imposing her own
solution to the fiscal crisis bedeviling the state
government. But once Mr. Dukakis was safely out of
Massachusetts airspace, Ms. Murphy moved, proposing spending
cuts, salary reductions and staff firings.
   The mutiny backfired, however, and actions that Ms. Murphy
had calculated would make her appear statesmanlike instead
won her the contempt of the political establishment and the
ridicule of commentators and the public.
