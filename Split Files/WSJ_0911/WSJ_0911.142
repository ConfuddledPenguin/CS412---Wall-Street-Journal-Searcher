   Tokyo stocks soared Monday, with the Nikkei Index posting
its sixth-largest daily gain in percentage terms.
   London shares closed higher, helped by a firm start to New
York trading but plagued by thin volume and what traders said
is a lack of long-term direction.

   Traders attributed the sharp gain in Tokyo to a technical
correction on the Nikkei's losses of more than 2000 points
this past week. Moreover, weekend news of a united
U.S.-Soviet stance against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait gave the
market psychological reinforcement and fueled active support
for futures.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues was up 1118.83 points at
25080.90.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index eased 186.60 points to
close the morning session at 24894.30.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 330
million shares, off from 443.3 million shares Friday.
Advancers widely outnumbered losers 925 to 69, while 64
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section jumped 57.35 points, or 3.11%, at 1903.28.
   The second section index rose 43.96 points, or 1.23%, to
3612.24. Volume in the section was estimated at 4.8 million
shares, down from 6.2 million shares Friday.
   Because volume was so thin, index-linked buying by
investment trust funds ahead of book closings at the end of
the month, as well as heavy arbitrage buying by major
brokerage houses, was easily able to drive up the key index
broadly, traders said.
   Brokerage houses are assisting in pushing up prices so
that investment funds can turn a profit over the next couple
of weeks, traders said.
   Aiding the market's turnaround was a much stronger yen,
noted Amy Yip, manager of sales at Baring Securities. As the
dollar has hit record lows against all major currencies with
the exception of the yen, Ms. Yip said she sees room for the
U.S. unit to fall further against the Japanese currency over
the next month.
   Although Ms. Yip sees some potential for the Nikkei Index
to slip 2000 points, barring extraordinary circumstances
linked to the Middle East crisis, she says the greater
likelihood is for a technical rebound of 3000 points upward.
   Ms. Yip partly bases her outlook on the expectation that
the yen will strengthen to 130 yen to the dollar within the
month.
   But she noted that "the yen is only one hurdle we have
cleared." Oil prices and interest rates, on the other hand,
won't come down from their high levels so soon, she said. And
while money markets are providing decent, guaranteed yields
of about 8%, stocks are still seen as hazardous.
   In addition, volatility is expected to increase later in
the week because Thursday is the last day of trading on
September options and futures, while window-dressers will
need to take profits, observers warned.
   But as investors try to judge the outlook for Tokyo
stocks, small chunks of buying should support prices in the
immediate near term, traders said. Greater buying
opportunities will arise, Ms. Yip said, as volume increases.
   Meanwhile, traders noted that Monday afternoon comments by
Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno regarding the central bank's
watchful eye on inflationary pressures choked buying for a
short period.
   But the official then said that the "Iraq shock" remains
manageable at $30 a barrel, compared with the blows dealt to
the Japanese economy by the two oil shocks in the 1970s.
Buying flooded into futures after the comments and then
spread into cash indexes, traders said.
   Stock prices were higher across the board Monday, but
particularly strong gainers included construction, financial
and shipbuilding shares.
   Nippon Hodo rose 160 yen to 2790 yen ($1.14 to $19.91),
while Misawa Homes jumped 140 yen to 1900 yen. Maeda
Construction added 50 yen to 1620 yen, and Kajima gained 70
yen to 1400 yen.
   Sumitomo Bank added 40 yen to 1830 yen, Mitsubishi Bank
gained 80 yen to 1930 yen, Nomura Securities gained 80 yen to
1700 yen, and Nikko Securities jumped 48 yen to 898 yen.
   Meanwhile, Wall Street's strong showing throughout the
course of London trading, maintained by a weaker oil price,
was keeping the London market firm, traders said. "If Wall
Street had opened easier, London would have drifted off," one
trader said.
   Apart from New York's lead, traders said there was a clear
lack of direction in the market. "London is so up and
downpeople just aren't committed to holding positions," one
trader said.
   Despite the weekend's show of solidarity between the U.S.
and Soviet Union over events in the Middle East, uncertainty
over the future of the region is still dominating the market,
traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
24.1 points to 2147.0, as the Financial Times 30 Share Index
closed up 16.6 at 1655.1. Volume was 296.4 million shares,
down from Friday's 331.8 million shares.
   The main trading activity of the day was seen in Polly
Peck, where 19 million shares changed hands. Market makers
speculated that company Chairman Asil Nadir might be trying
to rebuild his stake. Polly Peck officials were unavailable
to comment, and the company's brokers, Shearson Lehman Hutton
Securities, declined to comment. The share price climbed 13
pence to 275 pence (25 cents to $5.21).
   Rugby Group, which reported a 14% fall in pretax profit on
weaker performances in most of the company's operations, had
a 5 pence drop to 121 pence.
   Reckitt &amp; Colman jumped 29 pence to #12.23 on the back of
last week's positive interim earnings figures.
   Positive expectations prior to British Aerospace's
disclosure of interim results Wednesday caused a 12 pence
increase to 550 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher at all European stock
markets, except Zurich, which was closed for a national
holiday. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   And stocks ended higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei and Wellington, were mixed in Seoul, and lower in
Manila.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
