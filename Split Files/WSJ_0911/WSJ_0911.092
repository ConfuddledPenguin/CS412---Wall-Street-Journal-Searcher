   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The chip industry's leading indicator
dropped slightly in August, reflecting the business's
seasonal summer doldrums.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association said its so-called
book-to-bill ratio slipped to 0.99:1 in August from 1:1 in
July. That means that for every $100 dollars of products
shipped in August, manufacturers received $99 of new orders.

   Average monthly bookings for the three months ended Aug.
31 totaled $1.20 billion, up slightly from $1.19 billion for
the three months ended July 31 and up 8.2% from the $1.11
billion for the three months ended Aug. 31 last year.
   Semiconductor shipments totaled $1.26 billion for August,
up 16.6% from $1.08 billion in July.
