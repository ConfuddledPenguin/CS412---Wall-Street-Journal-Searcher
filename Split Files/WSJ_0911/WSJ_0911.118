   WASHINGTON -- As if Donald Trump didn't already have
enough to worry about, the luxury tax may be making a
comeback.
   Democrats' insistence on skewing any tax increase so that
it hits the rich and Republicans' resistance to raising
income-tax rates have revived consideration of the luxury
levy, which was imposed by the federal government during
World War II and not abandoned until 1965.

   Industries that make and sell goods the budget negotiators
consider luxuries are dusting off old arguments and coming up
with new ones in an effort to head off any new tax on their
wares.
   "The arbitrary selection of certain commodities as
luxuries is going to distort the economy," complains Matthew
Runci, executive director of the Manufacturing Jewelers and
Silversmiths of America.
   The pleasure boat industry says any new taxes would weaken
an already depressed industry and reduce demand for yachts so
much the government wouldn't make any money taxing them. And
the Electronics Industries Association says consumer
electronics aren't a luxury. "Our products are ubiquitous,"
says Gary Shapiro, vice president for consumer electronics.
   As previously reported, Democrats have proposed a 10% tax
that would apply to a retail purchase price in excess of $500
for furs, $1,000 for electronics, $5,000 for jewelry, $25,000
for autos, $50,000 for boats and yachts, and the entire
purchase price of private aircraft, according to a written
summary of their opening proposal at the budget talks under
way at Andrews Air Force Base.
   Under this proposal, for instance, the purchaser of a
$50,000 Porsche would have to pay $2,500 in federal luxury
taxes -- 10% of the price over $25,000 -- on top of any local
sales taxes.
   Republican aides say their side has contemplated a 5% levy
that would apply to the part of a car's price that exceeded
$30,000, as well as to other items, but they apparently
haven't put their proposal on the table.
   Thresholds at these levels would, in most cases, limit the
tax to a small fraction of all purchases. The jewelry makers,
for instance, were relieved; they had anticipated any luxury
tax would apply to items that cost far less than $5,000, and
there are indications that Republicans have considered just
such a plan.
   The vast majority of cars purchased by Americans would be
spared the tax. Only between 5% and 7% of all cars cost more
than $25,000, says Bernard Campbell of DRI/McGraw Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. The average car costs less
than $16,000, he says.
   But that isn't much consolation to auto dealers. "When you
start talking about that price range -- $25,000 -- it would
definitely have an impact in a market that's already in
turmoil," says Bill Fitzpatrick, general sales manager of
Metropolitan Motorcars of Marlow Heights, Md., which sells
Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Audi, Saab and Subaru autos. Dealers,
he says, would be forced to absorb at least some of the tax
with discounts or bigger trade-in allowances.
   Plans to revive the luxury tax were examined by the
Treasury during the Reagan years but never were proposed.
Defining just what is a luxury and what is not is always
tricky and controversial.
   And enforcing the tax can be a problem. The Democrats'
plan to tax consumer electronic products that cost more than
$1,000 could, for instance, encourage dealers to break
products into components that cost less than $1,000. It
wasn't immediately clear if the Democrats' plan covers
personal computers. Most of them sell for more than $1,000
but could easily be separated into parts that might sell for
less.
   The Joint Tax Committee of Congress estimates that the
Democrats' version of a luxury tax, if effective Jan. 1,
1991, would raise $600 million in fiscal 1991, which begins
Oct. 1., and $8.1 billion over five years.
   The luxury tax is part of a package of Democratic-backed
tax increases aimed at upper-income Americans that would
raise $14.4 billion in fiscal 1991.
