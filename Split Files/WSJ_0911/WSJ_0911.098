   The Iraq crisis is no mere sport, but to understand the
politics of this crisis a football metaphor helps. George
Bush has become the quarterback everyone expects to lead his
team to a final touchdown drive and victory. Meanwhile, all
of his teammates and fans claim to "support" the President,
but at just enough distance that they don't have to handle
the ball themselves, or take any blame if he falls short.
   Take Mikhail Gorbachev. The essential news from the
Helsinki summit is that the Soviets are fundamentally on
board with U.S. policy. They may not help the U.S. in a
shooting war, but they won't lift a finger for Saddam Hussein
either. This is the overriding strategic issue, and is what
gives George Bush the freedom of action in this case that no
U.S. President has had since the Soviets got the atomic bomb.

   Yet Mr. Gorbachev isn't about to sign on without his own
caviling and advice. He'll "reduce" the number of Soviet
military advisers, but won't withdraw them straightaway --
perhaps because he doesn't want to seem to be merely
following Mr. Bush. He can't resist floating the utopian hope
for a Middle East peace conference -- an idea gently but
firmly rebuffed by Secretary of State Baker.
   Mr. Gorbachev even delivers a little lecture that "no
single country, however powerful," can lead the world
anymore. The Soviet leader still wants to talk as if he
commanded a superpower, even if it can no longer act like
one. Mr. Bush may feel that this is the price of the more
important strategic cooperation from the Soviets on Iraq, and
if that's true it's all right with us.
   Something similar seems evident among Mr. Bush's domestic
"supporters." It's true enough that outright opponents are
few -- for the moment. But everyone's carefully hedged.
George Will frets that by using the United Nations Mr. Bush
has committed the U.S. to the hoariest notions of
international law. Congresswomen Pat Schroeder rolls out her
gripe for all seasons: What about the allies? Senator Joe
Biden doesn't want to restore the emir of Kuwait, as if this
is the main issue. Even Alexander Haig and Henry Kissinger,
whom we earlier carelessly credited with urging a
"pre-emptive strike," have in fact not gone that far.
   In a letter today, Georgia Senator Sam Nunn objects to
being included in a Paul Gigot column describing
neo-isolationism among conservatives. In the interests of
accuracy, what Mr. Gigot wrote was that "Mr. Nunn has
typified conservatives who've worried, grumbled and caviled."
Readers of his letter can judge that for themselves.
   What is most revealing in all of this is the timidity
among Washington's elites to state publicly the reality of
this crisis. Either Saddam's aggression will succeed or it
will not. The dispatches from Middle East capitals report
that Arab leaders all say privately that Saddam has to be
taken out soon with a military strike. But in the current
American foreign affairs gestalt, it somehow has become taboo
for anyone to be seen in public urging military action.
   While all of these elites now claim to "support" George
Bush, do they really? They're now well positioned to jump on
board and be seen as backing any successful mission Mr. Bush
decides to launch. But if the going gets tough, they're also
positioned to get going. Either way, they'd all rather let
George do it.
