   Continental Airlines Holdings and Electronic Data Systems
Corp. said they signed agreements on their previously
announced computer reservation system partnership.
   The partnership, announced in February, involves the sale
by System One -- Continental Airlines Holdings' reservation
system -- of its telecommunications and airline services
units to EDS for $250 million.

   The System One deal represents the biggest acquisition yet
for EDS in a series of moves by the General Motors Corp. unit
to buy all or part of major customers as a way to establish
footholds in new markets. EDS will get all of System One's
software and 2,200 former System One employees.
   As part of the agreement, EDS will provide data processing
to Continental, based in Houston, and to Eastern Airlines,
each of which will be a 25% owner of the new partnership.
Eastern was a unit of Continental until earlier this year,
when a bankruptcy court put the airline under the supervision
of a trustee.
   The agreement with EDS requires approval by the bankruptcy
judge overseeing Eastern's reorganization, and an EDS
official said no money would be released until then. A
hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 3.
