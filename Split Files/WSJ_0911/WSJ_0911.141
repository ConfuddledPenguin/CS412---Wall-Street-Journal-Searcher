   In a major sales strategy shift, mail-order company Dell
Computer Corp. will sell its full line of personal computers
through 13 Soft Warehouse Superstores nationwide starting
Oct. 1. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   One of the first and most successful mail-order computer
companies, Dell, based in Austin, Texas, previously shunned
conventional retail channels. Dell chairman Michael S. Dell
said in an interview last year, "We don't believe retail
stores are the more efficient way to sell these products."

   But analysts said that Dell has since discovered the
limitations of mail-order marketing. "Large corporations will
only buy so many computers over the phone," said computer
retailing analyst Seymour Merrin of Merrin Information
Services.
   The 25-year-old Mr. Dell said yesterday that selling
through retail will help him reach less-technical users and
increase future revenue. "It's not the only way for us to
grow," he said, "but it's a substantial way." Dell will
continue selling through mail-order.
   The exclusive sales agreement, in force through 1993, is a
boost for Soft Warehouse Inc., which has been in search of
more recognizable brand names for its deep-discount warehouse
stores. The closely held retail chain, which is based in
Dallas, normally discounts its products from 30% to 80%. But
to ensure it won't be undercut by Dell's mail-order
operation, the retail chain plans to sell Dell computers at
their usual mail-order prices, said Soft Warehouse president
Nathan Morton.
   The arrangement isn't without risk for Dell. To make the
Soft Warehouse contract worth Dell's investment of time and
resources, Dell must do at least 10% of its business, roughly
$50 million in sales, through retail, said Stewart Alsop II,
publisher of the P.C. Letter. Mr. Merrin doesn't think that
will be a problem, predicting the computer maker will sell at
least $100 million in the first year of the agreement.
   But if the company loses too many sales to Soft Warehouse,
it will cut into Dell's profit margins, said Wall Street
analyst Eric C. Zimits, of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes. Dell will
sell computers to Soft Warehouse at a discount.
   Founded in 1984 by Mr. Dell, who assembled and sold
computers in his college dormitory room, Dell Computer was a
pioneer in the mail-order marketing of personal computers. As
the company grew, Mr. Dell hired top engineers from companies
such as International Business Machines Corp. to design and
build higher performance computer systems that would appeal
to corporate users.
   Dell also added services such as toll-free telephone
support and next-day repair. The strategy paid off: nearly
half of Dell's customers are large corporations and sales are
expected to top $500 million in fiscal 1991, compared with
$388.6 million in fiscal 1990 ended in February.
   The move into retail comes on the heels of several recent
major Dell product announcements. The products, with powerful
features and aggressive pricing, were aimed at Compaq
Computer Corp. of Houston, which sells its products through
computer stores only.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Dell
shares closed at $12.50, up 25 cents.
   In an unrelated announcement Friday, Soft Warehouse said
it indefinitely postponed its initial public stock offering
set for the fall. Because of the crisis in the Middle East,
the market is too volatile for a stock offering, Mr. Morton
said. The company did not announce how much it planned to
raise, but it said the postponement won't affect expansion
plans.
