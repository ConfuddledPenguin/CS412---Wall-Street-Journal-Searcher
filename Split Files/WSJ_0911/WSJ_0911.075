   NEW YORK -- Stock and oil prices seesawed in opposite
directions as investors first coolly assessed the Mideast
developments, and then fearfully jumped at shadows.
   The October futures contract for crude oil started the day
dropping sharply lower -- as much as $1.69 a barrel -- and
stock prices headed higher; the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was up 34 points at noon.

   But oil turned around on a rumor that Iraq was massing
troops on the Jordanian border, and the October contract
closed with a gain of $1.26 a barrel. In turn, the thinly
traded stock market quickly lost steam; the Dow industrials
finished 3.96 points lower at 2615.59.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds also declined in response to
the rise in oil prices. The dollar edged higher against most
major currencies, but continued its decline against the yen
on the strength of rising stock prices in Tokyo.
   The weekend superpower meeting put the stock market's
relatively few investors in a good mood. "The most bullish
news was that we got the Russians on our side" in the Mideast
standoff with Iraq, said Kenneth Ducey, a trading official at
S.G. Warburg Securities.
   Rumors of military action in the Middle East were
concentrated in the oil futures pits, but spread fast to
jittery financial markets. Investors are "getting to be kind
of frazzled" by the lingering Mideast tension, said Gary
Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group,
Providence, R.I. "It's hysterics all having to do with oil
prices."
   In Washington, a Pentagon official said the U.S. hasn't
seen any signs of threatening Iraqi troop movements near
Jordan.
   Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief investment officer at First
Albany, noted that volume remained light. "Most investors I
talk to, large and small, have said it's too risky," he said.
"They feel comfortable with large cash positions and will
stay on the sidelines until there's a resolution in the
Mideast. The light volume is evidence of how uncommitted most
investors are."
   James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research, said
stocks' volatility yesterday indicates that "nothing has
really changed. We still have a dictator thumbing his nose at
world opinion and staying put in Kuwait."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 119.7 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues led decliners
777 to 739.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell a half of a point, or $5 for each $1,000
of face amount, in light to moderate trading. The yield on
the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.96%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
rose to 1.5820 marks from 1.5679 late Friday and fell to
139.55 yen from 140.05.
