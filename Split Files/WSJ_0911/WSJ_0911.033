   PARIS -- The heavily indebted French utility Electricite
de France, or EDF, said it needs capital from private
investors to pursue its development, but the Socialist
government is saying "no."
   While France is loosening investment restrictions on some
of its state-owned companies, EDF hasn't convinced the
government that its needs justify outside investment in the
sensitive electricity sector. "Opening its capital would
require a new law, and there are no plans to change EDF's
statutes," an Industry Ministry official said.

   In an internal memo to department heads this month,
management said EDF's financial situation was a serious
handicap to its development. "The disastrous structure of
EDF's balance sheet and especially our very heavy
indebtedness means that the company . . . loses credibility .
. . with the international financial community and foreign
clients," the memo said.
   EDF, which has financed most of its ambitious nuclear
program through international bond issues, had total debt
outstanding at the end of 1989 of 230 billion francs ($43.8
billion), about 1 1/2 times its annual revenue. It had a 1989
loss of 4.25 billion francs, which EDF officials blamed on
the government's refusal to allow the utility to raise rates.
