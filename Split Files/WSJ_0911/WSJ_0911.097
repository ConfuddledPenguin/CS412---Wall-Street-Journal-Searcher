   JOB OUTLOOK is weaker to static for college students this
semester.
   "It's more difficult for students to get positions now,"
says the University of Detroit, explaining, "There are fewer
jobs and more students wanting to fill them." But the
college's co-op education staff pressed a little harder this
year and managed to place 135 students, up from 120 the year
before. Michigan State sees plenty of fast-food and retail
jobs but says "the number of employers offering
career-related employment is more limited." Emory University
in Atlanta characterizes the job outlook as "fair to soft."

   At Northwestern University, though, the student job market
looks "about the same as in the past." Students, it says, are
"blowing off" an abundant number of jobs paying $3.55 or
$3.65 an hour and searching for better-paying positions. The
University of Chicago assesses the job market as "good, about
the same." Georgia Tech views the outlook as positive.
   Duke see no evidence that a weaker economy is keeping
undergraduates from continuing their education.
                                                                                                       

   HOW MUCH? Survey finds wide range in local-government pay.
   Mayors Kathryn Whitmire of Houston, Coleman Young of
Detroit, David Dinkins of New York and Art Agnos of San
Francisco each earns close to $130,000 a year, says City &amp;
State, a biweekly newspaper that covers governmental
business. Yet Ms. Whitmire administers $758 million in
general-fund revenue, an amount that pales in comparison with
the billion-dollar-and-up budgets the other three supervise.
And all four earn less than the fire chief in Los Angeles,
who pulled in $153,656.
   Los Angeles offers the most generous scales, paying an
average $128,904 to the 10 executives examined by City &amp;
State. New York trailed with $105,000, followed by San
Francisco, with $100,290, and Detroit, with an average of
$90,289. But ranking fifth at $89,442 was San Jose, Calif.,
though its $255 million of revenue put it far down the budget
roster. Syracuse, N.Y., with the same revenue, pays its
executives $51,217.
                                                                                                       

   BILINGUAL AND MINORITY teachers are scarce for public
schools.
   One in five of the 25,000 students in Glendale, Calif.,
speaks Armenian and limited English. Yet the district has
only 30 teachers who speak Armenian, and efforts to hire more
-- even those without teacher licenses produce little
success. Westminster, Calif., looks for Vietnamese speakers.
Houston schools scamper to fill 400 bilingual and
special-education elementary slots. Observes an official in
Goose Creek, Texas: "We're all out there trying to hire the
very best."
   Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., started looking in February to
fill 15 openings but found only one minority teacher. "We had
a limited pool of minority candidates this year," it says.
Park Ridge, N.J., couldn't find a "fit." New York City hired
3,000 teachers, a third of them minorities. Still it couldn't
hire enough teachers who speak Haitian-Creole.
   Glen Cove, N.Y., worries about next year, when half of the
state's teachers will be eligible to retire.
                                                                                                       

   THINK SMALL. Companies with under $500 million in sales
allocate 1.4% of their stock and 5.7% of their profit to
executive incentive plans, double what bigger rivals spend,
consultant Towers Perrin says.
                                                                                                       

   THEY'RE HAPPY, they say. More than half the executives
interviewed by consultant Goodrich &amp; Sherwood Co. say they
are highly satisfied with the pay, recognition and security
they get from their jobs.
                                                                                                       

   BUT THEY'D LEAVE. One in three managers think most
executives would flee the corporate suite to start their own
businesses if they could get the necessary funding, a
separate survey by Accountemps finds.
                                                                                                       

   EGAD, JAMES BOND, the Society for Human Resource
Management is teaming up with SPECTR. No, not 007's old
nemesis without the final E. SPECTR is an acronym for a
Soviet human-resource group.
                                                                                                       

   APPTITUDE TESTS can predict job success, a 50-year
look-back shows.
   A study of the New York City Police Department's rookie
class of 1940 "confirms amply the predictive powers of
objective aptitude testing," asserts Harvard psychologist
R.J. Herrnstein. The class of 300 men and 18 women was
probably the department's brightest. The survey of 151 of 192
survivors finds 88 were college graduates, 28 had law
degrees, one was a doctor. It certainly was the department's
most successful, producing a commissioner, four chiefs and
the greatest number of officers above captain, with service
averaging 25 years.
   Says the psychologist in a report for the Citizens Crusade
Against Crime: "Neither background family status, nor the
individual's own educational history, was as predictive of
success as the score earned on a 3 1/2-hour test taken over
half a century ago." In April 1939, some 29,000 men took the
exam, which was not unlike a college-entrance test; the women
were chosen by different criteria. The highest 3,700 men took
a physical test that accounted for 30% of the final grade.
Job offers went to the top 350.
   Their rank, long service and lack of disciplinary problems
"confirm the selection procedure," the study says.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: The National Labor Relations Board rules the
American Federation of Musicians Local 6 can't picket the
leader of a one-man band whose only non-union employee is
himself. . . . Griping about American productivity? Two of
three executives in the U.S. and half in Britain believe
Britons work slower, Robert Half International says.
