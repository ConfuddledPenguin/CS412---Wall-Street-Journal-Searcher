   BEIJING -- China's industrial output rose 4.6% in August
from a year earlier, but profits of industrial enterprises
continued to fall, official reports said.
   Much of the increased production simply went into already
large inventories, the English-language China Daily said.

from the like period of 1989, while the amount owed by
