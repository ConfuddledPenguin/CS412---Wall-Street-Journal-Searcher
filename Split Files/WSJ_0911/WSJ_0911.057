   New York -- It's fitting that New York, the nation's
theater capital, was the scene of a major change in the cast
of big-time tennis winners last weekend. Call the spiffed-up
production "New Faces of 1990," and expect its principals to
enjoy a long run as marquee names.
   The leading man in the U.S. Open, tennis's biggest and
best annual test, was Pete Sampras, a boy-next-door type from
suburban Los Angeles. In an eventful few days the
hard-hitting just-19-year-old rose from bit-part player to
star by beating Ivan Lendl, a three-time Open champion, and
John McEnroe, who'd won four times. In Sunday's final in
gray, cool weather, Sampras knocked glitzy Andre Agassi on
his brass, 6-4, 6-3 and 6-2. That made him the youngest male
singles winner of an event that dates from 1881.

   The heroine was Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, famous
heretofore as the sport's pinup; tall, dark-haired and
liquid-eyed, she had a perfume contract while the other girls
were endorsing sneakers. But on a skywriting-clear Saturday
afternoon, she upset top-ranked Steffi Graf of Germany, her
longtime nemesis, 6-2 and 7-6 (7-4), for her first Grand Slam
title.
   Based on the rankings, Sampras's victory was the more
surprising. The gangly serve-and-volleyer had climbed from
81st to 12th this year, largely off a couple of wins at
routine pro-tour stops. Though considered promising by many,
he hadn't made the splash of some of his contemporaries, and
had seemed content merely to win sets here and there from the
game's big guns.
   Last week, however, he had observers searching for
historical comparisons as his power game blew away whomever
he found across the net. Suffice it to say that he showed
America's biggest serve since Ray Kroc's. He pounded home 24
aces against Lendl in a five-set quarterfinal and 17 against
Mad Mac, resurgent as the Svengali of the Volley, in a
four-set semi, and the sharpness of his net work and passing
shots had Tennis Center crowds gasping in admiration.
   His Sunday matchup with the fourth-ranked Agassi, a French
Open finalist this year, was interesting on several counts.
The two are close in age (Agassi is 20), and their meeting
was the first all-U.S. men's singles final at the Open since
1979. It also presented a nice contrast in personal styles,
Sampras being a quiet, neatly barbered kid who wears
traditional tennis whites, while Agassi, clad in neon-lime
and black, added bleached hair, an earring and a sometimes
beard to every teenage girl's father's nightmare.
   "Me and my clothes are everything America is," declared
Andre at midweek, and one shudders to think he might be
correct.
   Agassi, from Las Vegas, is a baseline brawler, a la Jimmy
Connors, and on Saturday he counterpunched his way past
defending champ Boris Becker in a four-set semi. But on
Sunday he never laid a glove on Sampras. Hitting lines at
120-or-so mph, the winner struck 13 service aces and Agassi
just ticked a half-dozen more. Sampras's serve never was
broken, and he lost just 17 points in 13 service games.
   Agassi didn't force a break point on Sampras's serve until
the third set, and had only three in that one. Sampras won
the last four games, scoring 12 straight points in one
stretch. Asked later if he might have "done more" with
Sampras's serve, Agassi said he didn't get his racket on it
often enough to think about that.
   Sampras attributed his metamorphosis to "just a great
couple of weeks." Though he confessed to being nervous
against crowd-favorite McEnroe on Saturday, he said he felt
"no nerves or anything" Sunday.
   Had he ever played better? he was asked of his finals win.
"Not this week. Not this year. Probably never," he smilingly,
and accurately, replied.
   Sabatini came into the tournament ranked and seeded fifth,
but given the recent-years' domination of women's tennis by
Graf and Martina Navratilova her triumph was almost as big a
reversal of form as was Sampras's. Although only 20 years
old, Sabatini had climbed toward her sport's pinnacle before
but been repulsed, mainly by Graf, who'd beaten her 18 times
in 21 previous meetings.
   And this year, with 16-year-old Monica Seles coming on to
win the French Open, and 33-year-old Navratilova coming back
to win Wimbledon, Gaby had all but been discounted as a Grand
Slam threat. The book on her was that, while talented, she
was short on stamina and confidence, and her baseline-rooted
game lacked variety.
   But Seles fell in round three to 82nd-ranked Linda
Ferrando in the sort of upset that's rare in women's tennis,
and Martina went into one of her occasional trances and bowed
to No. 9 Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, a nothing-special
Bulgarian, in a quarterfinal.
   That opened the bottom half of the draw for Sabatini, and
she seized the opportunity mainly by dispelling the rap that
she's easily pooped. Her two-set quarterfinal win over Leila
Meskhi of the U.S.S.R. lasted 2 1/2 hours, and her three-set
semifinal with Mary Joe Fernandez, a 19-year-old Miamian,
consumed 13 minutes more. Meanwhile, Graf hummed through her
matches as though she were double-parked, averaging about an
hour on court in dispatching her first six foes.
   But according to her coach, Carlos Kirmayr, Sabatini
showed more than fortitude in beating Fernandez. "We'd talked
together a lot about her coming to the net more, but she'd
only done it when she was way ahead or behind," he said.
"Against Mary Joe, she came in on the big points, and she did
it again against Steffi."
   Two points stand out in that regard: A lunging backhand
volley winner that set up match point for Sabatini against
Fernandez, and a less gymnastic but equally effective sally
that did the same in the tiebreaker vs. Graf. Match point in
the final came on a forehand winner off a net-cord shot,
after which the newly confirmed net rusher rushed the stands
to embrace her loved ones.
   "I made up my mind I wasn't going to lose any points. I
wanted her to have to win them," Sabatini said after her
concluding victory. She'd said that before, but this time she
meant it.
