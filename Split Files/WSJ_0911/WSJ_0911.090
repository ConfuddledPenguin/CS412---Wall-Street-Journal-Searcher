   NEW YORK -- Wall Street investment bankers, hungry for
deals during a prolonged U.S. takeover drought, are flying
around the world, trying to cash in on a boom in the sale of
state-owned companies.
   Known as privatizations, such sales are gathering momentum
in Latin America, Asia and Europe. The boom follows a series
of successful sales of government-owned companies in Britain
starting in 1984.

   This year alone, several Wall Street firms have advised
sellers of state-owned telephone companies. Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. is advising the governments of Mexico and Puerto Rico,
First Boston Corp. represented New Zealand, and Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. advised Argentina.
   The state-owned companies may be sold outright to
private-sector companies in the same industry. For example,
the New Zealand phone company is being sold to two U.S.
regional telephone companies. Or they may be sold to
investors in public stock offerings, as British companies
have been.
   Bruce Bockmann, the investment banker responsible for
privatizations at Morgan Stanley, a unit of Morgan Stanley
Group Inc., says some industry estimates are that state-owned
companies valued at more than $200 billion may be put up for
sale over the next five to 10 years.
   To be sure, no one believes the fees involved will
entirely make up for the slowdown in lucrative
mergers-and-acquisitions work on Wall Street. The
privatization deals are labor-intensive and may take years to
complete. But the billion-dollar size of some of them offers
the chance of big paychecks.
   "With the slowdown in the M&amp;A market, this is an area
whose time has come on a global basis," says Charles Murphy,
head of the investment banking group at First Boston, a unit
of CS First Boston Inc. He has teams pursuing such business
in Eastern Europe and South America.
   Mike Overlock, head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman
Sachs, says the firm's teams advising Mexico and Puerto Rico
on their telephone sales involve M&amp;A people, corporate
finance and other investment bankers. But because the clients
are governments, instead of corporations, he adds, the deals
"are more complex and have more issues."
   Behind the boom in privatizations is a rightward tilt in
world politics that envisions a reduced role for government
in nations' economies. While the most striking example of
this trend is the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe,
most of the biggest sales of state companies are in
capitalist countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
   "The preference for a market economy, moving away from
government enterprises, is sweeping the world," says Lewis
Kaden, a partner at the New York law firm Davis Polk &amp;
Wardwell, which is advising Puerto Rico on its telephone
sale.
   Rodney Lord, editor of Privatisation International, a
London newsletter, says privatization is occurring "on a
wider scale than in the mid-1980s," when the conservative
Thatcher government sold British government stakes in gas,
oil, steel, airlines and telephone concerns.
   Last year's biggest deal was the sale of 10 British water
companies to the public for $8.38 billion, according to
Privatisation International. In recent years, France and
Spain also have sold major industrial concerns.
   Many of those stock offerings proved lucrative bonanzas
for Wall Street. But one of them also highlighted the
enormous risks involved. Four U.S. securities firms had
losses of about $75 million apiece in 1987 when the stock
market crashed in the middle of a $12.33 billion offering of
British Petroleum Co.
   Mr. Lord notes that several Latin American countries,
including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, are pursuing
privatization programs as a way of reducing debts they piled
up during the 1970s and now can't pay.
   One example of how this works occurred recently when
Morgan Stanley advised the Argentine government on the sale
of its state-owned telephone company. The two buyers, groups
led by Telefonica S.A. of Spain and Bell Atlantic Corp. of
Philadelphia, will acquire 60%; employees and the public will
get the rest.
   The two groups that won the bidding, both of which
included banks that held Argentine debt, put up packages of
cash and Argentine debt totaling about $800 million, and made
commitments for future capital spending levels. Though the
Argentine debt's face amount was $5 billion, it was exchanged
for phone company stock at a discounted value of only $550
million.
   Other countries are selling state-owned companies to
reduce government budget deficits, according to Thomas
Keesee, an international investment banker at First Boston.
Indeed, many of the industries most often affected, such as
telecommunications and airlines, face heavy capital spending
requirements that governments may be eager to avoid.
   Investment bankers say their fees for handling
privatizations are generally less than they would receive for
corporate mergers or stock offerings of the same size, even
though privatizations may involve more work. On Wall Street,
investment banks typically charge fees of about 0.5% of the
value of a big merger, and 2% to 3% of a big stock offering.
   For investors, buying into a state-owned company may pose
some special risks. The political winds may shift, and a
privatized company may be nationalized all over again. As
recently as the early 1980s, France nationalized dozens of
companies after the Socialist government of Francois
Mitterrand came to power.
   If a company is nationalized again, the owners may be
compensated, but only at a price negotiated with the
government itself -- hardly conditions for a home-run
investment.
