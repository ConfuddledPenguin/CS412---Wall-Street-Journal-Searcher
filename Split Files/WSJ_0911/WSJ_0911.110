   TOKYO -- Nippon Steel Corp., the largest steelmaker in the
developed world, will begin making and selling notebook-sized
computers in the U.S. in November.
   The machine, which will be compatible with the IBM-AT
personal computer standard, is the latest example of the
Japanese steel industry's dash to diversify into everything
from semiconductors to theme parks.

   "Three to four years ago, the steel industry was in a very
depressed time," Kiyofumi Suzuki, general manager of Nippon
Steel's electronics and information-systems division, said at
a news conference Monday. "Our executives decided to get into
electronics and other areas not related to steel."
   Unlike fledgling computer industry entrants from Taiwan
and South Korea, Nippon Steel says it won't make low-priced,
imitative knock-offs, but instead wants to cultivate a
leading-edge image. "Our target is to be the No. 1 or No. 2
brand {in quality} in the U.S. within three or four years,"
Mr. Suzuki said. "We will reduce our volume until we can get
support for consumers and distributors."
   The company said its Librex machine will be the first in
its segment with an Intel Corp. 80386sx processor, and that
it is slightly smaller and lighter, weighing about six
pounds, than competing models.
   The price, $4,500 for the 386 model and $3,500 for a
version with the slower 80286 Intel processor, is roughly the
same as other notebook-size computers currently on sale in
the U.S.
   Nippon Steel says it won't even consider selling in Japan
until after it has proven itself in the U.S. The Japanese
personal-computer market is less developed, is dominated by
the relatively proprietary NEC Corp. standard, and "is not
open compared to the U.S.," even for Japanese newcomers, Mr.
Suzuki said. The company will begin exploring the European
market later this year.
   Although it doesn't make any of the major parts, Nippon
Steel says it engineered the machine itself, drawing on its
years as a major user of computers and computer systems. "The
steel companies have acquired their own expertise in
electronics because of processing innovations," said Mineko
Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse's Tokyo
office. "In developing their own software," she added, "they
have acquired expertise and programs. It was a natural
outcome."
   In recent years, Nippon Steel has established a joint
venture with Concurrent Computer Corp. to make super
minicomputers, and signed an agreement to sell Sun
Microsystems Inc. workstations in Japan. Two years ago, the
company set up four software development and service
joint-ventures.
   Nippon Steel executives hope to push the company's
dependence on steel down to 60% of revenues by 1995 from 80%
today. They also want to derive one-fifth of their business
from the electronics and information-systems group, which
provides about 5% today.
   Nippon Steel isn't alone in its move to diversify. Kobe
Steel and Kawasaki Steel have semiconductor joint ventures
with American partners. And all the major steel companies are
exploring unconventional uses of their excess land, such as
pig farming and flower growing. Nippon Steel opened a theme
park in southern Japan earlier this year.
   Their rationale: Despite a surprising revival in steel
sales recently, industry demand is expected to drop about 10%
over the next five years, particularly as users seek lighter
new materials.
   Analysts say it's too early to tell, however, how
successful such diversifications will prove, and many express
skepticism. "I think it's pretty unlikely the steel companies
are going to be able to carve a niche in PCs," said Michael
Jeremy of Baring Securites' Tokyo office. "For Japanese
computer makers it's an extremely competitive area. What
advantage do the steel companies have?"
   Nippon Steel, however, has fairly ambitious plans. It
hopes to sell 30,000 notebook computers next year and 50,000
annually within three to five years. By comparison, NEC,
which has more computer experience, expects to sell 20,000
notebooks for 1989 and 1990 combined.
   Mr. Suzuki said Nippon Steel hasn't finalized any
distribution agreements. The notebook-sized computers will be
assembled by Solectron Corp. of San Jose, Calif. Librex
Computer Systems Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon
Steel's U.S. unit, is also based in San Jose.
