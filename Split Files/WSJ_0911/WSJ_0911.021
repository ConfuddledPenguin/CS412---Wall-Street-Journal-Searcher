   NEW YORK -- KPMG Peat Marwick's board nominated Jon C.
Madonna to succeed Larry D. Horner as chairman and chief
executive officer of the accounting and consulting firm's
U.S. practice.
   Mr. Madonna, 47 years old, currently heads the firm's San
Francisco office and sits on the 34-member board. P.J.
Butler, senior partner of the U.K. practice, has been
nominated to succeed Mr. Horner as head of the international
practice. If Mr. Butler is elected by the KPMG council, his
term will begin Jan. 1.

   The board also nominated James G. Brocksmith Jr., 49, to
succeed Robert W. Beecher as deputy chairman for a three-year
term. Mr. Brocksmith is head of the firm's Chicago office.
Mr. Beecher would reach the mandatory retirement age of 60
during another term.
   The board's nomination doesn't guarantee that the
candidates will be elected by a majority of the firm's 1,850
partners, who are to meet Oct. 4 to vote. Partners have until
Sept. 20 to nominate their own candidates; a nomination by 5%
of the partners is required. No alternative slates have been
proposed. Terms begin immediately after election in October.
   In early August, Mr. Horner, 56, said he wouldn't seek
re-election. He could have stood for an additional three-year
term, but he said issues at the firm required an executive
who would be able to serve a longer time. The chairman's term
is six years.
   KPMG Peat Marwick is the U.S. national practice of KPMG.
It was formed in the December 1986 merger of Peat Marwick
International and Klynveld Main &amp; Goerdeler.
