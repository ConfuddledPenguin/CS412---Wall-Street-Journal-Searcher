   WASHINGTON -- Top Bush administration officials said
budget negotiations with congressional Democrats are making
little progress toward a deficit-reduction pact.
   "I would say that talks are going nowhere fast," Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady said on ABC's "Good Morning
America." And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters: "We are still hopeful but looking less and less
optimistic."

   Democratic negotiators weren't talking, but aides
confirmed that the talks are moving slowly. With little
progress to review, a planned meeting yesterday morning
between President Bush and congressional budget negotiators
was canceled.
   Few details leaked from the fourth day of closed-door
talks at Andrews Air Force Base near here, but longstanding
differences about raising income-tax rates and cutting
capital-gains-tax rates were reportedly aired. Much of the
day was consumed by intraparty caucuses.
   Some Democrats are uneasy about the possibility that Mr.
Bush will criticize them in his televised address to Congress
on the Middle East crisis scheduled for 9 p.m. today. But Mr.
Fitzwater said, "I don't expect any strong criticism in the
speech, rather it will be more geared to laying out our
objectives . . . why especially in view of the Persian Gulf
situation it's important that the U.S. put its domestic house
in order."
   Without some agreement to reduce the deficit or alter the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, about $85 billion in
across-the-board spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1.
