   The huge amount of U.S. military supplies being sent to
the Mideast has caused some disruptions in commercial freight
shipments, but shippers doubt it will absorb overcapacity in
the industry.
   Nevertheless, with the U.S. military chartering commerical
vessels and booking space on ships in regular commerce, ship
company executives say the Mideast buildup offers some
opportunities to offset slowing demand from civilian
shippers. "It could be a shot in the arm for the shipping
industry," said Jack Helton, a vice president of Sea-Land
Service Inc., the ocean shipping unit of Richmond, Va.-based
CSX Corp.

   So far, the U.S. government has chartered 41 commercial
vessels, some at double the usual charter rates, to carry
equipment to the Mideast. In addition, the federal government
plans to ship more than 1,000 containers a week on commercial
vessels to resupply U.S. troops.
   Thomas D. Lewellen, corporate traffic supervisor of
Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Ill., blames the Mideast buildup
for delaying a shipment of the company's tractors and heavy
machinery at Charleston, S.C., for a week, earlier this
month. The equipment had been scheduled to sail aboard the
American Falcon to Europe, but the freighter was abruptly
chartered by the military for Mideast service. "It's very
disruptive doing business with offshore customers," said Mr.
Lewellen, who rerouted the cargo to another freighter.
   Other shippers play down the effects of the military
buildup, which coincides with a glut of ship capacity. The
day the American Falcon was removed from commercial service,
"every ship carrier in the book called us to say everyone
should expect a price increase," said William McNellis,
director of transportation/logistics at J.I. Case Co., a unit
of Tenneco Inc. "They were trying to make a non-event a major
event to hopefully get shippers to agree to pay higher
rates."
   Ship companies aren't sure whether to expect a windfall or
a headache from increased military cargo. "If the buildup
were to end in a very short time it would be a headache,"
said Mr. Helton, the Sea-Land vice president. "If the supply
line is in place for six months we would expect to come out
whole."
   Mr. Helton said Sea-Land has had to charter additional
vessels and containers for a period greater than six months
to haul food, clothing and other supplies to U.S. troops in
the Mideast. If the supply line is ended before that time,
Sea-Land would be stuck with extra capacity and costs, he
said.
   Sea-Land, the largest U.S.-flag container ship company, is
starting two new weekly ship services to expedite military
shipments to the Persian Gulf from ports in Europe and Asia.
The ships connect with Sea-Land's regularly scheduled vessels
from the U.S. By skipping some intermediate ports, Sea-Land
expects to shave the transit time for military cargo to the
Mideast from the U.S. East Coast to 23 days from the usual 33
days, Mr. Helton said.
   Some ship companies are receiving premium rates when they
charter their vessels to the military. For example, Lykes
Bros. Steamship Co. has chartered one freighter at $34,000 a
day, about twice the usual charter rate, some shippers said.
Lykes officials say the charter rate attempts to compensate
Lykes for taking the ship from commercial service. Eugene
McCormick, president and chief operating officer of closely
held, New Orleans-based Lykes, said that "when you bump a
commercial customer, he has to find an alternative carrier.
When you want to go back to that customer, he says, `where
were you when I needed you -- forget it.'"
   The most immediate effects of the Mideast buildup were on
the air cargo industry, which was pressed into service early
to fly supplies to Saudi Arabia. One result: Northwest
Airlines has canceled five of the 20 weekly freighters from
Japan to the U.S., causing delays for about 450 tons of
freight a week. About 5% to 10% of the shipments are delayed
for a day, said Seiji Saito, Northwest's manager of cargo
sales for eastern Japan.
   Mr. Saito says he hasn't received complaints from
customers so far. But the delays may become a bigger issue as
air shipments enter a peak season from September to the end
of November, he said. "We're short of capacity, as it is," he
said.
   Geoffrey Tudor, a spokesman for Japan Air Lines, said that
the company has offered to supply up to four flights a week
for shipments to the Middle East. That may lead to a
reduction in the company's regular freighter service, he
said.
   One U.S. Navy officer being transferred to Japan has
already felt the effects of the Mideast crisis on freight
transportation. The officer's household goods were supposed
to come to Japan aboard a U.S. Air Force plane. Instead,
without warning, the plane was commandeered for use in the
Persian Gulf and the officer's goods were loaded on a slow
boat across the Pacific.
   Transport industry officials in London said they haven't
experienced capacity strains as a result of increased
military shipments to the Persian Gulf.
   "There doesn't seem to be any difficulty," said an
official with the Baltic Exchange, a London-based
international shipping market. "In fact, it would be
appreciated if it had. The market seems to be fairly quiet.
{The military buildup} hasn't moved rates."
   An official from London-based LEP Group noted the excess
of merchant shipping capacity. "There's no freight moving to
Kuwait, which was an active trader, and there's been a
downturn in trade in the Gulf area," as companies steer away
from trade in the region, he said. The official added that
merchant vessels doing business in the Mideast have imposed
surcharges in recent weeks, but he said the higher rates
reflect increased fuel and insurance costs, not strained
capacity.
