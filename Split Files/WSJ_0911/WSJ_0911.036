   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- P.T. Bank Duta, the private
Indonesian bank whose huge, unexplained foreign-exchange
losses came to light last week, has had its financial
position put right in surprisingly short order.
   Industry sources close to the bank said the losses were
made good with capital from Bank Duta's majority
shareholders, three foundations chaired by President Suharto.
And, as authorities had promised, Bank Duta is functioning
normally.

   The central bank, Bank Indonesia, won't say how big the
foreign-exchange losses were. But the sources, who insisted
on anonymity, said losses totaled about $300 million, or
nearly double the capital of Bank Duta, one of the country's
largest private institutions.
   The in-house bailout is good news for Bank Duta's public
shareholders, who own 20% of the shares, but adds to the many
unanswered questions about the bank's troubles and the
soundness of the country's financial system. Indonesia has
hundreds of charitable foundations similar to the three that,
together, own 72% of Bank Duta. They aren't required to
publish accounts or financial statements, and little is known
of their activities.
   Bank Duta has long been considered politically
well-connected. Some bankers said the three foundations were
able on their own to raise the funds to prop up the bank,
while others said they could have received some discreet aid
from Bank Indonesia. Such a move would have allowed the
central bank to help without having to publicly violate its
oft-repeated pledge not to bail out private banks that get
into difficulties because of mismanagement.
