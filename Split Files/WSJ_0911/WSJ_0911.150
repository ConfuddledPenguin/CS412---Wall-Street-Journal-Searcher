   DENVER -- Tired of waiting for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and Congress to give approval, the nation's
largest marketer of so-called natural beef said it will begin
marketing an organic beef to the public.
   The new beef, however, won't be called "organic" on the
label, a move designed to skirt trouble with the USDA.

   Mel Coleman, chairman and founder of Coleman Natural Meats
Inc., said his new brand of meat will carry a label that
defines what he thinks "organic" means. The small print on
the label will include: "Our animals never receive
antibiotics or growth hormones from the time they are born. .
. . They receive only feeds produced without herbicides and
pesticides."
   The Coleman Organic Beef name will be used only on
advertising materials -- not on labels -- because the USDA
has yet to approve the use of the word "organic" on labels.
Congress, however, may force the USDA's hand by approving the
use of "organic" and a definition of the word along with the
1990 Farm Bill, which is currently in conference committee.
Both the House and the Senate have passed similar versions of
an amendment that would allow the USDA to approve organic
labeling on consumer foods.
   Mr. Coleman, who lobbied for the bill, said he has
received certification for the product from the Organic Crop
Improvement Association, an international group. He is the
only meat producer to receive the OCIA's certification.
   Coleman Natural Beef will continue to outsell Coleman
Organic Beef, because it is less expensive, Mr. Coleman
predicted. But he currently has more organic beef orders from
retailers than he can fill, he said. The difference between
the organic and natural beef is that the natural beef cattle
may eat feed that isn't certified as organic, Mr. Coleman
said.
