   SAN DIEGO -- DH Technology Inc., a maker of printers and
printing supplies, said its board approved a plan to buy back
as many as 150,000, or about 3%, of the approximately 4.8
million shares outstanding in transactions from time to time.
   The company said the shares bought back would eventually
be distributed to certain managers and other employees as
part of a stock option compensation plan. DH said its board
might approve additional repurchases later, depending on
stock prices. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
DH shares closed at $8.25, up 25 cents.
