   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. said it signed a
memorandum of understanding with Japan Air Lines to discuss
investment by JAL in the aerospace concern's newly formed
Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Inc. subsidiary.
   A Lockheed spokesman said the company plans to invest
about $20 million to modify a hangar and purchase equipment
for the unit, which will maintain and modify Boeing Co. 747
aircraft. JAL may acquire a minority stake of 10% or more in
the unit, the spokesman said. Aircraft modification is a
growing business for Lockheed and other aerospace companies,
as their defense business shrinks.

   The Lockheed unit has agreed with Norton Air Force Base in
San Bernardino, Calif., to lease two bays of a four-bay
hangar. When the base closes, sometime before 1994, Lockheed
will occupy the rest of the hangar. Each bay can accommodate
one Boeing 747 jetliner.
   JAL has the world's largest fleet of Boeing 747s and is
highly experienced in maintaining and modifying the plane,
Lockheed said. JAL anticipates that a significant number of
its aging 747 aircraft will need modifications in the near
future, Lockheed said.
   Lockheed is preparing the hangars to meet commercial
specifications. The facility is expected to begin operations
in the first quarter of next year. After a year of operation,
the unit is expected to have about 600 employees, increasing
to nearly 1,000 by 1994. The spokesman said Lockeed has about
75,000 employees.
