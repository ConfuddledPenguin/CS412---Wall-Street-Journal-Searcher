   SAN FRANCISCO -- California has crafted an aid package
that should prevent a distressed rural county from filing for
bankruptcy.
   Last month, Butte County came within a day of becoming the
first county in U.S. history to seek protection from its
creditors under a special chapter in the federal bankruptcy
law. But on Friday, the state's finance department, armed
with emergency legislation, offered a bailout package valued
at $7.4 million and recommended $6.6 million in budget cuts.

   The county, home to about 180,00 people, is studying the
state's offer, but its board of supervisors has decided to
cancel plans for a bankruptcy filing in the meantime.
   By law, counties in California must balance their budgets
each year. Because of increasing state-mandated services and
repeated voter-rejection of local tax increases, Butte County
has found it impossible to balance its books even after
cutting deeply into library, police and other services.
