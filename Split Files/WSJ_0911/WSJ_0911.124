   PRINCETON, N.J. -- UJB Financial Corp. agreed to sell its
consumer credit card portfolio for more than $250 million to
the Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank subsidiary of Bank of
Montreal.
   The commercial banking concern said it will post a
third-quarter gain of $50 million on the sale, which is the
premium Harris Trust agreed to pay above the value of the
portfolio. For 1989's third quarter, UJB reported earnings of
$31.4 million, or 69 cents a share.

   UJB said, however, that continuing softness in its service
area's economy is forcing it to increase its provisions for
possible bad loans. Such provisions plus expenses from the
sale will wipe out much of the $50 million gain, it said.
   UJB Chairman T. Joseph Semord cited fierce competition in
the credit card market and the slowing of the economy as the
main reasons for exiting the card-issuing business. UJB,
which expects to close the transaction this month, will
invest proceeds from the sale into other product lines, Mr.
Semord said.
   UJB has $13.3 billion in assets and provides financial
services through 270 offices in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania. Bank of Montreal has about $70 billion in
assets.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UJB shares rose 12.5 cents to $12.25.
