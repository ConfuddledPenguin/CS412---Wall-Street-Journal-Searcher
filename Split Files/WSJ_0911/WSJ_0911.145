   Bank customers are getting faster access to funds
deposited in their accounts under new federal banking rules
that took effect Sept. 1.
   But there's a catch. Now customers have got to put money
in their accounts more quickly to cover the checks they
write. And in some cases, banks are imposing new limits on
customers who make deposits in automated teller machines.

   These changes are due to the final phase of a 1987 federal
law that directs banks, thrifts and credit unions to give
customers quicker access to funds deposited in their
accounts. That also means that accounts are being debited
more quickly.
   For checks written on another local bank or other
financial institution, depositors are getting use of the
money within two business days after the day of deposit.
That's one day sooner than they had been getting it since the
last prior speed-up in check-clearing in 1988.
   For checks written on a nonlocal institution, the funds
must now be available within five business days after the day
of deposit, instead of seven. As before, funds deposited in
the form of cashier's checks, certified checks and government
checks must be available the next business day.
   The new schedule for funds availability is part of an
effort to wring "float" out of the nation's financial system.
Float is the time that elapses between the moment a check is
deposited in a customer's account, the bank verifies that the
check writer has an ample balance to cover the check, and the
money is actually credited to the customer's account.
   Many consumers long have used that time-lag to pay bills
by check when their accounts lacked sufficient funds.
Usually, they were counting on adequate funds being in their
account by the time the check was presented for payment. With
the new clearing schedule, that free ride is shorter.
   But there are others who say the tightening of the
check-clearing process is long overdue. Many consumers have
long believed that bankers have dragged out the
check-clearing process to use the float for their own
benefit.
   A 1986 survey by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
found that 53% of the 458 banks and thrifts that it surveyed
held local checks anywhere from three to five days before
crediting an account, and that 76% held out-of-state checks
for more than one week.
   But in the zeal to reduce float, bankers say, lawmakers
have heightened the risk of fraud.
   Bankers have argued that time is needed to catch checks
backed by insufficient funds before money is credited to an
account. While the shorter availability period is little
problem for checks written on accounts with adequate
balances, it poses real problems for returned checks. On
average, it takes more than six business days for a bank to
learn that a check is uncollectible.
   Officials at two large East and West Coast banks say that
they have been able to trace higher incidence in fraud, such
as counterfeit checks, to the tighter clearing schedules.
However, they didn't want their institutions identified and
wouldn't quantify the sums lost to fraud.
   Robert Hutchinson, senior vice president of Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., says, "The trend in terms of fraud involving
checks is definitely up, but it's impossible to determine how
much of the problem is due to faster availability. The
professional crooks are very knowledgeable about the
regulations."
   To counter the fraud risk, banks are taking various steps.
The New York Clearing House Association, a group of large New
York banks, has plans for clearing checks on other
clearinghouse banks the same day that they are deposited.
That will allow the clearinghouse banks to spot
insufficient-funds checks before they are credited to an
account.
   The tighter clearing schedules could prompt some regional
networks of automated teller machines to say they may no
longer accept deposits.
   In August, National Bank of Detroit, a unit of NBD Corp.,
announced that it would no longer allow its customers to make
deposits at other institutions' ATMs. A bank spokeswoman said
risks posed by the shortened availability period prompted the
move.
   And several regional ATM networks, such as the 2,900-ATM
Money Stations network in Ohio, may consider refusing
deposits. Edmond Gough, president of Money Station Inc.,
says, "We're hoping Congress amends the law before it gets to
that."
   Still, it's relatively rare for a bank customer to make a
deposit using an ATM of a bank where he or she doesn't
already have an account. For instance, the Money Station says
that only 5.5% of the 4.5 million transactions that it
handles each month involve such deposits.
   Many had assumed that advances in ATM technology would
allow banks to know within two days whether an account at
another bank had adequate funds.
   But that hasn't happened, although CoreStates Financial
Corp., Philadelphia, is experimenting with an ATM that can
read checks.
   Marcia Z. Sullivan of the Consumer Bankers Association
says, "The problem is that there isn't any way to read both
the amount of the check and the routing code" electronically.
"That has to be done manually, and it's too expensive."
   The Fed has backed the banks up on this and is pushing to
get the law amended so that a bank will have five business
days to credit a deposit made at another bank's ATM for
another four years.
   Edmond Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate with the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, says, "We agreed not to
oppose the amendment in the Senate, but that's not to say
that we're supporting it. We're unsatisfied with how the
banks have spent the last three years getting ready for this.
They say the only solution is an ATM that reads the code and
the amount."
