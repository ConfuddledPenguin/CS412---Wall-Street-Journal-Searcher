   Granges Inc. said it agreed to pay 5.5 million Canadian
dollars (US$4.7 million) to two Toronto companies to settle a
lawsuit filed against Granges by Abermin Corp. in 1988.
   Under terms of the agreement with CSA Management Ltd. and
Goldcorp Investment Ltd., all related claims have been
dropped, Granges said. The two companies, as Abermin's major
creditors, became party to the suit when Abermin went
bankrupt in March.

   In its suit, Abermin sought to rescind a joint venture
with Granges under which they developed the Tartan Lake gold
mine in Manitoba. Abermin alleged that the mine's reserves
were lower than first forecast, and that costs exceeded
projections.
   Granges initially forecast output of 50,000 ounces of gold
annually at the mine, but later reduced its forecast to
20,000 ounces. Production, which began in 1987, was suspended
last fall.
   Under the accord, Granges said it will acquire Abermin's
partnership interest in the mine, plus related mineral claims
and assets. It said funds to cover the settlement will be
drawn from C$20.5 million of funds previously set aside.
   Granges, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, is
32.3%-owned by Australia's M.I.M. Holdings Ltd., a large
mining concern.
