   NEW YORK -- Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. was dropped
from the pollution-control and waste-management industry
group of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index, because 55% of
the concern now is owned by Waste Management Inc., already in
the group. Chambers Development Co. Class A was added to the
group. Both moves were effective yesterday.
