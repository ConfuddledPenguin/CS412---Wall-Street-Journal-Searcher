   Computer users don't have an unrestricted right to
duplicate copyrighted software, even if it is for their own
use, a U.S. district court judge ruled in Philadelphia.
   The ruling sets a narrow standard for "fair use" of
copyrighted software, and is likely to set a precedent in an
area of law that hasn't been extensively litigated,
intellectual property, attorneys said.

   "There are still many questions about how you can
legitimately copy software," said Ron Laurie, an attorney at
Irell &amp; Manella, Century City, Calif. "For example, can you
copy it only for use as intended by the manufacturer? I can
see this decision being applied in that context. What this
does is set some limits on copying."
   Current copyright law allows users to copy software when
loading it into a computer; for archival purposes; and for
legitimate "adaptations," copies that have been modified so
much that they qualify as unique.
   While a working definition of "adaptation" hasn't been
hammered out in the courts, last week's decision appears to
rule out any modification that has been made for the
commercial gain of a user or third party, attorneys said.
   The ruling, by Judge Thomas N. O'Neill Jr., came in a case
that started in 1985 as an antitrust complaint filed by
Allen-Myland Inc., a Philadelphia firm that modifies
mainframe computers, against International Business Machines
Corp., the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant. In 1988, Judge
O'Neill found in favor of IBM on most of the antitrust
charges; he dismissed the remaining claim last week.
   IBM raised the copyright issue in counterclaims when it
alleged that Allen-Myland had illegally copied its microcode
-- software wired into a computer's chips -- to modify models
of IBM's 3090 mainframe computers owned by Allen-Myland
customers. IBM said Allen-Myland should have bought extra
copies of the microcode instead of copying it. "We feel this
sets a very important precedent in intellectual property
law," said a spokesman for IBM, which has been increasingly
aggressive in the area.
   Larry Allen, president of Allen-Myland, said his company
plans to appeal at least part of the verdict, which exposes
Allen-Myland to potential losses of as much as $10 million.
"The question is: Do I have to pay IBM for copying something
that {an Allen-Myland customer} owns, even if I'm copying it
so I can modify it for that person's exclusive use?" Mr.
Allen said. "I don't think that's fair."

   FAMILY-LEAVE LAW in New Jersey challenged by business
coalition.
   A coalition of business groups, which include the state
chamber of commerce and a retail merchants association,
launched a constitutional challenge to New Jersey's new
family-leave law, one of the most liberal in the nation.
   The business groups filed suit yesterday against the state
and several officials, alleging that the statute conflicts
with the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA).
   The New Jersey law, which went into effect in May,
requires companies with more than 100 employees to provide 12
weeks of unpaid leave with benefits every two years to
employees because of the birth or adoption of a child or a
serious illness in their immediate family. In later years,
businesses with fewer employees would also be affected.
   But the plaintiffs maintain that the costliest mandate,
health insurance benefits for employees on leave, conflicts
with ERISA rules regarding all employee welfare benefit
plans.
   According to the suit, filed in New Jersey Superior Court
in Trenton, ERISA explicitly "does not mandate that employers
provide any particular benefits." But because ERISA doesn't
explicitly state that such benefits can't be mandated, the
defendants are likely to argue that it doesn't prevent the
state from requiring them.
   The ERISA challenge is particularly strong because of
Congress's explicit desire to craft a single national
standard to govern employees and employers, says Steven W.
Suflas, a labor lawyer with Archer &amp; Greiner in Haddonfield,
N.J. "You have an express statement within the statute that
ERISA supersedes state law," Mr. Suflas said.
   A spokesman for the New Jersey division of civil rights, a
defendant in the suit, said he hadn't seen a copy of the
complaint and couldn't comment on it.
   Recent efforts to change federal law failed when President
Bush vetoed family-leave legislation.

   ALLIED STORES bondholders threaten suit over sales of
retail chains.
   Bondholders of Allied Stores Corp., embroiled in
bankruptcy-court proceedings, have informed Allied that they
intend to sue to recover between $700 million and $1 billion
the bondholders committee claims belongs to Allied and its
creditors.
   The proposed targets for the so-called fraudulent
conveyance actions include Federated Stores Inc. and Campeau
Corp., Allied's parent companies; Bank of Montreal; Banque
Paribas; Citibank; and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. The
litigation plans were revealed in a letter from the
bondholders committee's lawyer, Jonathan M. Jacobson, to
lawyers for Allied.
   Allied and Federated filed for bankruptcy court protection
on Jan. 15.
   Allied bondholders hope to recover some $500 million from
Allied's sale of Ann Taylor in 1989 and $193 million from its
sale of Brooks Brothers in 1988. They claim the money was
improperly funneled through a network of holding companies to
creditors of Campeau Corp. U.S. Inc., now known as Federated
Stores Inc. The bondholders say the money should have gone
into Allied's own coffers.
   The bondholders were required to give Allied 30 days
notice before filing suit. "Our investigation is at the point
where we believe it's clear to us that the claims are
meritorious," said Mr. Jacobson. "It makes no sense to wait
further before beginning this process because waiting further
will in our view delay the reorganization of Allied and
Federated."
   In his letter to Allied, Mr. Jacobson said the filing of
the suit would be postponed if it looked as if the claims
would be resolved without litigation.
   David Heiman, counsel to Allied and Federated, said that
he would file a motion with U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge J.
Vincent Aug Jr. in Cincinnati asking him to defer the
lawsuit. Mr. Heiman said it was "premature to file the
litigation now without giving the debtors a chance to see if
we can't negotiate resolution of these claims rather than
proceed to formal litigation."
   In documents filed with the bankruptcy court, Allied
maintained that "a negotiated compromise holds promise for
bringing value to the estate expeditiously, economically and
fairly" and that "immediate litigation would result only in
obduracy, hardened positions and resulting delay."
   Bruce Bennett, lead counsel to Federated Stores Inc. and
special counsel to Campeau, said: "We disagree with the legal
contentions set forth in the letter. . . . We will continue
our efforts to propose and negotiate plans of reorganization
for the debtors which are acceptable to all affected
constituencies. If acceptable plans cannot be confirmed, it
may be that a court will have to decide the merits of this
controversy."
   Henry Weisburg, an attorney for Citibank, said, "The vast
majority of the allegations in the letter are unrelated to
Citibank. Those that relate to Citibank are totally without
merit."
   Lawyers for Bank of Montreal said they couldn't comment.
Counsel for Banque Paribas and DeBartolo couldn't be reached.
   Judge Aug is expected to hold a hearing on the issue Sept.
27.

   EX-GOVERNORS to track state tax and regulatory matters for
law-firm clients.
   Seventeen former governors now in private practice
gathered in Washington yesterday to announce the creation of
the National Resource Center for State Laws and Regulations.
Based in Raleigh, N.C., the nonprofit organization will issue
papers on tax and regulatory developments in 50 states,
incorporating political analysis by former state officials.
   Among the ex-governors who will participate are Jim Hunt
of North Carolina, William Winter of Mississippi and Philip
Noel of Rhode Island.
   The center's seed money is a $150,000 grant from the State
Capital Law Firm Group, a bar organization that monitors
information about developments in state government.
Corporations and trade associations are being solicited by
mail to become dues-paying members, according to the center's
chairman, J. Phil Carlton, a former associate justice of the
North Carolina Supreme Court. Members will receive the policy
papers on a regular basis.
   The former state officials who provide the analysis in the
policy papers won't receive a fee for this work but will be
paid if members desire more detailed information.
   Moreover, "there's a potential to generate new clients"
through the center, says former Gov. Noel, whose law firm,
McGovern, Noel, Falk, Pannone, Proccacini, &amp; O'Leary, does
some lobbying work in Providence. R.I.
