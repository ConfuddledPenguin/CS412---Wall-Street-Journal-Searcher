   Federal regulators rejected Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association's plan for unloading its $2.9 billion junk-bond
portfolio, increasing the likelihood that the government will
eventually take over the thrift.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it "cannot approve"
the complex transaction, under which Columbia was to sell its
junk bonds to Gordon America L.P., a partnership affiliated
with Toronto-based Gordon Investment Corp. The deal
apparently foundered on unusual and generous financing
provisions that would have left the government on the hook
for huge losses if the bonds, which have lost about $1
billion of value in recent months, withered further.

   Gordon America had agreed to pay $3 billion for the
portfolio, a slight premium that surprised many analysts and
investment bankers given the tumult in the junk market of
late. However, the terms included 90% financing, to be
provided by Columbia on a so-called non-recourse basis. That
meant that Gordon America could walk away from the
transaction if additional losses exceeded 10%, and Columbia
would have had to buy the bonds back. That would instantly
doom Columbia, which is already insolvent by $352.2 million
as of June 30, and make its failure even more costly for the
government than it would be now.
   The financing method had been under attack from some
quarters since the deal was disclosed July 25 and was certain
to come under Congressional scrutiny. The OTS said terms of
the financing "raised a signficant legal issue of compliance"
with provisions of the thrift bailout bill passed in August
1988, which required thrifts to divest their junk-bond
holdings. Under the financing terms, Columbia could have
wound up having to take back the bonds, in contravention of
that provision.
   Furthermore, the OTS said that Columbia might fail even if
the transaction went through, resulting in the government
holding the notes financing the junk-bond sale. The OTS said
the government "could be required to disaffirm the proposed
financing arrangement" under those circumstances.
   The OTS added that no all-cash bids had been sought during
Columbia's search for a buyer for the portfolio and that
Columbia didn't consider any bids that would have given the
thrift a share of any future gains in the portfolio.
Consequently, the OTS said it "could not be confident the
bidding process had produced the best ultimate value for the
portfolio."
   The proposal had been a longshot from the start. It became
even more wobbly following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- the
economic uncertainty provoked by the Gulf crisis prompted one
of the partnership's major financial backers, companies
controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Kashing, to reconsider
their role. Richard Li, son of the Hong Kong tycoon, said on
Aug. 30 that his family might withdraw from the deal.
   Beyond that, even if the transaction went through,
Columbia still would have had to raise some $300 million to
$400 million to meet new capital requirements. Edward G.
Harshfield, who took over as chief executive of Columbia
after the architect of the junk-bond portfolio, Thomas
Spiegel, stepped down in December, had hoped to raise some
$200 million through the sale of other securities to help
narrow the capital deficit. Still, many industry analysts and
investment bankers considered a government takeover of
Columbia likely, even if the deal had gone through.
   Mr. Spiegel has since been accused of looting Columbia and
faces federal civil charges. The government is seeking at
least $24 million in restitution and penalties from Mr.
Spiegel.
   Mr. Harshfield said in a written statement yesterday that
Columbia would try to restructure the deal, but the rejection
of non-recourse financing limits Columbia's options. Without
such financing, analysts believe Columbia would have to write
down the bonds an additional 10% to 15%, increasing the
thrift's negative net worth. And few investors are expected
to have much interest in paying cash for the portfolio, even
after further markdowns.
   For the six months ended June 30, Columbia had a loss of
$429.9 million, or $21.39 a share.
