   TORONTO -- Workers at most Abitibi-Price Inc. paper mills
in eastern Canada went on strike, shutting down about 7% of
North American newsprint capacity.
   Analysts and industry executives said a short strike won't
have much impact on the newsprint market. Other producers can
make up some of the production lost at Abitibi's mills. As
well, U.S. publishers and other users had an average 39-day
supply of newsprint on hand at the end of July, the latest
figures available.

   But a long strike could cause problems for publishers and
push up newsprint prices. "The newsprint market was pretty
tight already," said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc.
   Publishers are worried about possible strikes at other big
Canadian newsprint concerns. On Friday Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd. presented a final offer to workers at
three newsprint mills and one pulp mill in eastern Canada.
The company expects an answer by tomorrow, a spokesman said.
The three Canadian Pacific Forest newsprint mills account for
about 7% of North American capacity.
   Talks with Abitibi broke down late yesterday, a spokesman
for the Canadian Paperworkers Union said. The company
presented its final offer to the union early yesterday
morning. The union presented a counteroffer yesterday
afternoon but the company wouldn't alter its final proposal,
the union spokesman said.
   Industry and union officials said workers at Abitibi and
other pulp and paper mills in eastern Canada aren't happy
with the contract accepted earlier this summer by workers at
Stone Container Corp.'s Canadian unit. The Stone Container
contract was supposed to set the pattern for workers at other
mills in the region.
   The strike has shut down seven Abitibi mills in Ontario,
Quebec and Newfoundland, six of which make newsprint, Abitibi
said. A union official said two other mills in Quebec are
expected to join the strike. Abitibi mills at Alma, Quebec,
and Pine Falls, Manitoba, which are represented by other
unions, will continue to operate, Abitibi said. As well, the
company's two U.S. mills aren't affected by the strike. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Abitibi closed at
$13.375, down 12.5 cents.
   Separately, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
Canadian production of newsprint rose 1.4% in July from a
year earlier as the industry operated at 94% of capacity.
   The industry group said Canadian mills produced 826,000
metric tons of newsprint in July compared with 815,000 metric
tons a year earlier. For the year to date, output fell 1.4%
to 5.56 million metric tons from 5.64 million metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.
   The July 94% operating rate was down from 95% in May and
from 96% a year earlier.
   July shipments fell 3.0% to 751,000 metric tons from
775,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to Canada rose
while shipments to the U.S. and other foreign markets fell.
For the year to date, shipments rose 0.2% to 5.49 million
metric tons from 5.48 million metric tons in the year-earlier
period.
