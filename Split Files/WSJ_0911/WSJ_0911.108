   NEW YORK -- Seagram Co. said its board authorized the
purchase of as much as 5%, or 4.7 million, of the Montreal
distiller's common shares on the open market at various times
for the fiscal year starting Sept. 25.
   At yesterday's closing price of $75 a share, up 12.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
stock repurchase's indicated value is about $352.5 million.

   Seagram, which has 94.1 million shares outstanding, can
buy the stock on the Montreal, Toronto and New York stock
exchanges.
   This is the fifth consecutive year Seagram's board has
authorized a share buy-back, a spokesman said. He added that
Seagram's stock "remains a desirable investment" and that the
repurchase "undoubtedly . . . would help support" the share
price.
   Under Seagram's most recent buy-back, which expires Sept.
24, the company bought a total of about 2.1 million common
shares for an average $78.04 apiece, as of Aug. 31. That plan
also allowed for a total purchase of 5% of the company's
common outstanding.
   Seagram recently reported a 3% increase in net income for
its second quarter, ended July 31, to $205 million, or $2.18
a share.
