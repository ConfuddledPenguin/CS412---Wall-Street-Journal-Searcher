   NEW YORK -- The stock market, hurt by a rumor-driven surge
in the price of oil, proved unable to hold an early rally and
closed mixed in another quiet session.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped out to an early
gain of more than 30 points, which it held until midafternoon
when rumors of Persian Gulf military activity and a
subsequent surge in oil prices sparked a market sell-off. The
industrial average ended the day with a loss of 3.96 at
2615.59.

   The industrial average, falling less sharply than the
broader market indexes, benefited from continued buying of
"defensive growth" issues, stocks of companies expected to
perform well if a Middle East war should break out or the
economy should fall into a recession.
   Among the broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 1.77, or 0.55%, to 321.63; by comparison, the
loss in the Dow Jones industrials amounted to 0.15%. The New
York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.81 to 176.70 and
the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 1.49 to 298.14.
   But advancing issues edged decliners by 777 to 739 on the
Big Board, reflecting the broad-based advance that began the
session. Traders attributed the early rally to the impact of
Sunday's summit between President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, an early drop in oil prices and a strong
performance from overseas stock markets.
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei Index of 225 issues soared 1118.83
points to 25080.90, while shares closed higher in all
European stock markets except Zurich, which was closed for a
holiday.
   The post-summit optimism proved short-lived in New York,
however, as rumors surfaced in the afternoon that Iraqi
planes had invaded Saudi Arabian air space. The rumors, which
weren't confirmed, fueled a surge in oil prices that
propelled October crude-oil futures to $31.30, up $1.26, in
New York trading.
   Sell programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage -- the
purchase of index futures and the sale of stocks to lock in
profits from the price differential between the two --
weighed on the market as oil rallied.
   The sluggish trading of the past two weeks continued, with
Big Board volume amounting to 119,730,000 shares, slightly
below Friday's total of 123,800,000 shares.
   "It's a market that's still very fragile," said A.
Marshall Acuff Jr., a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, adding that the light trading shows a lack of
confidence among investors.
   With the Mideast situation unresolved and other problems
confronting the market -- such as the economy, the federal
budget deficit and high levels of corporate debt -- investors
are adopting a "let someone else be first" attitude toward
stocks, Mr. Acuff said.
   Toys "R" Us went down 1 to 22 1/8 on composite trading of
2.6 million shares and Wal-Mart Stores fell 1 to 27 on 1.4
million shares. Salomon Brothers lowered its investment
ratings on the two retailers, along with its earnings
estimates on several other retailers, to reflect the
potential for softer earnings in a recessionary environment,
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.
   Energy stocks fell despite the afternoon upturn in oil
prices. Exxon fell 1/2 to 50 3/8, Chevron lost 1 1/4 to 76
3/4, Texaco fell 1 1/8 to 63 3/8, Mobil dropped 1 1/8 to 65
3/8, Unocal lost 7/8 to 32 1/2 and British Petroleum dipped 1
1/2 to 81 5/8; in the oil-services sector, Halliburton eased
1/4 to 54 1/4 and Dresser Industries lost 1 1/8 to 49 3/8.
   Meanwhile, precious-metals stocks tracked a drop in the
price of gold. October gold futures fell $11.10 an ounce to
$380.30 in New York trading. Newmont Mining retreated 1 7/8
to 43 1/8, Coeur d'Alene Mines fell 1 to 26 3/8 and Amax
dropped 3/8 to 14 3/4. Shares in all three companies will be
put up for sale shortly, The Wall Street Journal reported
yesterday in its "Heard on the Street" column, and analysts
think other gold producers could follow suit.
   Gains in overseas stock markets translated into buying
interest in several single-country mutual fund issues. New
Germany Fund rose 5/8 to 11 3/8, Emerging Germany Fund
climbed 5/8 to 8 3/8, Italy Fund went up 3/8 to 11 7/8,
France Growth Fund rose 1/8 to 8 7/8, Mexico Fund added 1/4
to 13 1/4 and Japan OTC Equity Fund rose 1/2 to 9 3/4.
   UAL, which surged 7 7/8 Friday, rose another 2 to 102 1/4.
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Paul Nisbet issued a
report which predicted that the union-led buy-out of United
Airlines' parent company would be consummated by October.
   McDonnell Douglas gained 1 1/8 to 48 3/4 after the Bush
administration and South Korea reached an agreement on the
sale of 120 of its F/A-18 Hornet fighter planes, a contract
valued at $4.7 billion. Separately, McDonnell said it expects
to record a third-quarter gain of about $234 million from the
purchase of an annuity contract, covering benefits to about
14,200 retirees, from Metropolitan Life Insurance.
   United Telecommunications added 5/8 to 25 1/2. PaineWebber
raised its investment rating on the stock to "attractive"
from "neutral" and boosted its 1991 earnings estimate by 15
cents a share, to $2.40.
   Johnson Controls gained 5/8 to 24 after putting its
battery business up for sale. The company said it will
consider selling all or part of the operations.
   TCBY Enterprises rose 5/8 to 7 after boosting its
quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share from three cents.
   Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust tacked on 3/4 to 4 7/8. The trust,
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, filed a
reorganization plan calling for it to pay creditors in full
and to make dividend payments.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index declined
0.56 to 323.21, reflecting the weakness in oil and gold
issues. Volume totaled 10,600,000 shares.
