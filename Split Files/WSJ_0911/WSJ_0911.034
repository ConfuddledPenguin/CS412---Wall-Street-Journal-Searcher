   THETIS ISLAND, British Columbia -- Donovan Saul shuffles
down the road, his eyes glued to the ground. Suddenly, he
jackknifes and scoops up from the roadside what appears to be
a gobbet of Silly Putty.
   The thing hangs limply on Mr. Saul's glove for a moment
and then plops into a pail, joining a bunch of other pale,
shapeless things slithering around in their own slime.

   Mr. Saul makes his living as a professional slug catcher.
He sells them for $30 per hundred slugs, and most of his
customers are biology teachers with plans to dissect. Each
year his one-man company, Beaver Biological Supplies, ships
thousands of the slimy creatures all over the world from this
damp little coastal island. Only about 200 people live here,
but there are tens of thousands of fine, fat slugs, some
measuring a foot in length. Mr. Saul proudly compares Thetis
Island and its slugs to Bordeaux and its wines. "You can't
find slugs as big or as plentiful anywhere else," he boasts.
   There is one big open question: Why should anyone want
them? The humble slug, a gastropod land mollusk (genus
"Limax"), is no beauty. A relative of the snail, it is
spurned by the squeamish and hated by gardeners the world
over. It can eat its weight in vegetables in one sitting,
making good use of its 3,000 tiny teeth. How much demand,
after all, can there be for a repellent little animal with
four noses that prefers to live under a rock?
   Plenty, actually. Allen Gelperin, a neuroscientist at
AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., heads a team
of researchers who hope slugs can help them develop
computerized artificial intelligence. Half a dozen other labs
in the U.S. and Japan are trying to do the same thing, he
says.
   Slugs, it seems, have an unusually well-developed sense of
smell. Mr. Gelperin and his Bell Labs cronies have managed to
find the link between a slug's nose and the olfactory
receptor part of its brain. "We puff odors on the nose cells
and watch to see how the brain oscillates and changes," he
says. Carrot and mushroom smells seem to trigger the most
reaction.
   The Bell Labs team has trained slugs to shun their
favorite foods by pairing such odors with tastes slugs seem
to hate -- quinine, for instance. The scientists hope
eventually to map the slug's neural transmission patterns and
use the information thus gleaned to develop computer software
that can read stimuli much the way a police scanner reads
radio signals.
   "The advantage of the slug," says Mr. Gelperin, "is that
it is complicated enough to be interesting, but not so
complicated as to be intractable."
   Some researchers seem to find slugs downright adorable. In
her basement lab at the University of Washington in Seattle,
Ingrith Deyrup-Olsen shows off a light green, six-inch long
specimen. Gazing deeply into its eyes (which are moving about
at the tips of two protruding stalks), she wonders: "How
could anyone not love a face like that?"
   Ms. Deyrup-Olsen has a researcher's interest in the slug's
amazing ability to produce mucus. When alarmed, a slug can
secrete one-third its body weight in mucus, a substance that
feels a bit like Krazy Glue and is next to impossible to
remove. Slugs use the stuff to grease their paths, exuding it
from a gland beneath their heads and slithering along,
leaving shiny slime trails in their wake. They can even sling
the slime from trees and slide down, Tarzan style.
   Ms. Deyrup-Olsen says the slugs' glands ooze mucus at will
to protect their delicate skin. They will also slough their
protective slime shield so as to remove bacteria and other
contaminants. "Then they eat it," she says. (Table manners
aren't the slug's strongest selling point.)
   But Ms. Deyrup-Olsen believes slugs are well worth having
around. Indeed, their sliming mechanism could hold keys to
understanding such diseases as cystic fibrosis -- a fatal,
congenital disease of children -- and gastric ulcers. In
both, the body fails to properly secrete a protective mucus
shield.
   Slugs' well-known penchant for beer is something else that
fascinates researchers. Organic gardeners know to put out
containers of beer for slugs and snails to climb into and
perish. "People kept asking me which beer do they like best?"
says Whitney Cranshaw, a biologist at Colorado State
University, in Fort Collins. So, three years ago, Mr.
Cranshaw conducted a taste test that might have pleased
Anheuser-Busch Cos., but probably didn't.
   He rounded up 2,500-odd slugs and put out 16 brands of
beer in saucers. Budweiser was the slugs' favorite, 5-to-1,
according to Mr. Cranshaw's paper on the project. The
winners, as does happen, died in their beer. Anheuser-Busch
hasn't used the research findings in its advertising, Spuds
Mackenzie being a more effective spokes-animal for Bud Light
than a suicidal, alcoholic, hermaphroditic slug could be.
   The University of California at Santa Cruz, on the other
hand, has chosen the slug as its mascot. The school's 9,600
students voted overwhelmingly in 1986 to replace the sea lion
with the slug.
   Santa Cruz went a little nuts at first over its new
mascot. "The basketball team started wearing those
boing-boing antennae and creeping out on the floor on their
bellies, making cellophane slime trails," says Daniel Wood,
the school's sports director. Opponents still occasionally
show up bearing giant saltshakers (salt makes slugs shrivel
up and die a horrible death by dehydration). But the Santa
Cruz Slugs get fewer taunts these days. "Athletes kind of
like the slug's status as perpetual underdog," says Mr. Wood.
   Indeed, slugs do seem to arouse mixed emotions, especially
here in the Pacific Northwest where they abound as nowhere
else: There are said to be more than 600 of them hanging out
in the average garden. E.M. Matson Co., a Seattle concern
that sells tons of an ominously named pesticide called
"Corry's Slug and Snail Death" also does a brisk business in
T-shirts that feature a couple of likable slugs peering from
a box of slug bait.
   Theodore Roethke, the Northwest poet, once composed a
paean to the slug. The late Mr. Roethke called the creature a
"loose toe from the old life" and compared its "white skein
of spittle" to quicksilver . . . "beautiful, in its way."
   Up and down the Pacific coast, small towns exploit their
slugs by holding annual slug derbies. (A very fleet slug can
cover 50 yards in a day -- no snail's pace -- though most
races are held, for the sake of expedience, on a one-yard
course.)
   At the annual Slugfest in Guerneville, Calif., the main
attraction is a bakeoff, with a panel of judges gamely eating
their way through slug specialties supplied by local
residents. If snails are a delicacy, why not slugs? A
sampling of this year's entries: sweet and sour slugs and
slug pizza. A martini, with a slug instead of an olive (and,
of course, a slug of gin) tastes "just awful," according to
Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelson, a member of the
judging panel.
   On Thetis Island, Mr. Saul is himself ambivalent about
slugs. He dispatches more than his share: Piles of
five-gallon buckets brimming with dead slugs pickling in
formaldehyde line his laboratory, and that's just a two-day
catch. But since he bought Beaver Biological four years ago
and left his job as a wildlife ranger, he says he's come to
identify with his prey.
   At the island firehouse, chums of Mr. Saul refer to the
35-year-old biotechnologist as "Slug Man." And he readily
admits to certain humane impulses: "I'm probably the only one
on the island," he says, "who swerves away when he sees a
slug on the road."
