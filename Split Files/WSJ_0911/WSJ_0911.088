   PHILADELPHIA -- After passing the toughest anti-takeover
law in the nation earlier this year, Pennsylvania lawmakers
will consider another measure that could make the state more
attractive to corporations: a specialized court system for
business litigation.
   A bill filed yesterday with the Pennsylvania State Senate
would create a special chancery court patterned after the
Delaware Court of Chancery. That court is the only one in the
country specializing in corporate legal matters, such as
hostile takeovers and shareholder suits. The court's
expertise and reputation for liberal business laws have done
much to establish Delaware as the nation's foremost corporate
host.

   Pennsylvania's proposed law, which goes further than
Delaware's in one key respect, has yet to be formally
introduced in the Senate chamber and isn't likely to be acted
on before the state legislature adjourns Nov. 30. It was
filed by State Sen. H. Craig Lewis, a Democrat from Bucks
County, outside Philadelphia, at the behest of several
business and legal groups, including the Philadelphia Bar
Association.
   "This is the first step in the process of getting people
to focus on it," said William E. Zeiter, a corporate law
specialist in the Philadelphia office of Morgan, Lewis &amp;
Bockius who helped draft the measure.
   The proposed law in Pennsylvania would create a court for
nonjury trials before appointed judges who specialize in
business law, as in Delaware. But Delaware's court deals only
with matters of corporate governance and requests for court
orders and injunctions, so-called equity matters.
Pennsylvania's chancery court would have exclusive
jurisdiction not only in such matters but also in suits for
damages in commercial disputes where the contested amount
exceeds $500,000.
   That provision is the most controversial aspect of the
proposed law and is one of several items that would require
amending the state's constitution. Pennsylvania, like all
states, guarantees the right to a jury trial in all civil
disputes.
   "Because the proposal is so new, it has received little
debate in the Legislature. Its sponsors are uncertain what
political support it will receive or how a final version of
the bill will look," said Mr. Zeiter. The provision doing
away with jury trials in commercial litigation that involves
amounts exceeding $500,000 is sure to be controversial, he
added.
   Nevertheless, the proposed law already has been warmly
received by influential business and legal groups that see
specialized business courts as increasingly important. The
English, Swiss and German judicial systems, for example, all
have separate courts with judges who specialize in commercial
matters.
   "We think it's a very good idea to have a court which is
made up of judges and support people who are versed in
corporate law," said Jay H. Tolson, chairman of the
Pennsylvania Business Roundtable, an association of business
executives from 42 of the state's biggest corporations.
   Delaware's Court of Chancery is often cited as the premier
reason why so many companies -- nearly half those listed on
the New York Stock Exchange -- are incorporated there.
Pennsylvania, by contrast, can claim only 4%. But backers of
Pennsylvania's proposed law say the measure isn't aimed
solely at competing with Delaware. "The main benefit is to
offer expeditious judicial review of corporate legal
matters," said Ruth E. Ganister, head of the Philadelphia Bar
Association's business law section.
   The average civil suit filed in Philadelphia takes five
years to work through the city's Court of Common Pleas. The
same case filed in Pittsburgh takes an average of three
years, said Mrs. Ganister.
   The Pennsylvania Senate Judiciary Committee tentatively
scheduled a public hearing on the bill for tomorrow. But no
further action is expected until the Legislature begins its
1991 session in January.
   Because the proposal involves amending the state's
constitution, it will have to win approval by a two-thirds
vote of both houses of the Legislature, or majority votes in
both houses during two consecutive sessions, before the
public would vote in a referendum.
   "As is typical in Pennsylvania," said Mrs. Ganister, "this
will require a fairly lengthy process."
