   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., the troubled Australian company,
is discussing with bondholders a swap of bonds for stock or
stock-related instruments.
   The possible deal, a "scheme of arrangement" under
Australian law, would affect holders of Swiss franc and
deutsche mark bonds, all unsecured, and U.S. dollar and
sterling-denominated convertible bonds, also unsecured and
subordinated to all other creditors of the company.

   Details of the talks weren't disclosed.
   The shares, or debt instruments structured as shares,
would not necessarily be common shares, according to the
company. Some may be redeemable preference shares, which Bond
Corp. would have to redeem before paying dividends on any
other shares and within a set time period.
   Shares also could be preferred convertible shares that
would have a preferential right to a fixed payment if the
company were liquidated and be convertible into ordinary
shares if the firm recovers. Separately, holders of the
US$200 million of Bond Corp.'s subordinated convertible notes
postponed a meeting on the sale of the Australian brewery
assets until Sept. 27.
   Separately, Airship Industries Ltd., a British designer,
manufacturer and retailer of airships that is 47%-owned by
Bond Corp., said it asked its bankers to call in receivers
because of financial difficulties.
