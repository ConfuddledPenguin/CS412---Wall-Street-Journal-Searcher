   H.J. Heinz Co. reported that net income in the fiscal
first quarter increased 13% to $143.2 million, or 54 cents a
share.
   The Pittsburgh-based food-products company said it
benefited from price increases in most of its product
categories as well as the strength of foreign currencies
against the dollar -- which makes U.S. products cheaper
overseas.
