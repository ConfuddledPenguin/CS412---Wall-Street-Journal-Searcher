   CANBERRA, Australia -- The cabinet approved a plan to open
Australia's communications system to competition.
   The government said it plans to ask outsiders to submit
proposals for the formation of a new telecommunications
company that will compete with the government-owned
Australian Telecommunications Corp., known as Telecom.
Successful bidders would be granted the necessary licenses to
operate in the country and gain access to Australia's
existing telephone network.

   At the same time, Telecom, which currently has a monopoly
on Australia's domestic telephone service, will merge with
OTC Ltd., the government's international telecommunications
concern.
   The moves are part of a government effort to partly
privatize certain state-owned businesses, including its
airlines, to repay debt, increase competition, and make the
industries more efficient.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said that as part of the plan the
new telecommunications company would acquire Aussat Pty.
Ltd., a government-owned satellite-services concern. "Both
network operators will compete internationally as well as
domestically," Mr. Hawke said. "We will ensure that the new
network shares Telecom's network at a price Telecom would
charge itself."
   Kim Beazley, Minister for Transport and Communications,
said that "notionally" the new telecommunications operator
could start as a 100% foreign-owned concern. But companies
tendering to set up the new network would be "stupid" to
propose 100% foreign ownership, he added.
   The majority of the new operator ultimately should be
Australian-owned, Mr. Beazley said. He wasn't specific on
when it must have a majority of Australian shareholders.
"That is to be worked out through the tender process," Mr.
Beazley said.
   Industry analysts believe that foreign companies
interested in taking a stake in a new Australian
telecommunications company include Bell Atlantic Corp. and
American Information Technologies Corp. (Ameritech), which
acquired Telecom Corp. of New Zealand earlier this year, MCI
Corp., Bell Canada Enterprises Inc., Cable &amp; Wireless PLC,
British Telecommunications PLC and Racal Telecom PLC.
   BellSouth Corp. of the U.S. also said yesterday that it is
interested in entering Australia's telecommunications
industry and could invest three billion (US$2.47 billion) to
four billion Austrialian dollars over several years in a
network competitor if it wins the tender.
   Ross Ramsey, director of corporate development for
BellSouth, said his company will tender for Aussat with
Australian consortium partners.
   Mr. Beazley said foreign telecommunications companies are
showing "an enormous amount" of interest in taking part in
the proposed new Australian network.
   Foreign expertise is needed to establish competition to
the current monopoly telephone operator, the minister said in
a television interview. But "all those who anticipate coming
into this country anticipate also that they're going to be,
in the end, a minority partner," he said.
   Mr. Beazley said the new company will both plug into the
existing Telecom network and develop its own network.
   British Telecom said in a statement late yesterday it is
interested in competing in Australia.
   Peter Hutton, managing director of British Telecom
Australia Pty. Ltd., said the extent of British Telecom's
interest will depend on "the rules of the game, such as the
regulatory framework, the type of competition and the
opportunities open to a foreign investor."
   Australian companies that have been mentioned as possible
members of consortiums to establish the new concern include
transportation companies TNT Ltd. and Brambles Industries
Ltd., cable maker Pacific Dunlop Ltd., steel maker Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. and Exicom Ltd., a maker of
telecommunications products.
