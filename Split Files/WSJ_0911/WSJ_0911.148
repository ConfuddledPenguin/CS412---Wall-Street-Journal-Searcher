   SADDLE BROOK, N.J. -- Vornado Inc. said its board
authorized management to convert the company into a real
estate investment trust.
   The real estate leasing company said the conversion would
involve, among other things, payout to shareholders either in
cash or securities of all accumulated earnings of about $80
million.

stockholders, which have a 70% stake in the company, could
hold no more than 50% of company shares, Vornado said.
