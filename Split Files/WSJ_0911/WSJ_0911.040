   The Persian Gulf crisis continued to dominate trading in
the oil and gold pits yesterday, sending the price of gold
down and the price of oil on a roller-coaster ride that ended
on an upswing.
   Both commodities initially tumbled as traders digested
news from the Helsinki, Finland, summit. Although the Soviet
Union at that meeting threw its support behind the U.S.
stance against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, it failed to
pledge military support to the effort. Without that extra
military might, a protracted stand-off seemed to traders to
be more likely than a war that might disrupt the flow of oil
from the Middle East. As a result, war jitters evaporated
again for the moment and along with them some of the war
premium buoying prices.

   Also putting early pressure on prices was an offer by
Saddam Hussein to provide free oil to Third World countries
starved for oil as a result of the Iraq-Kuwait embargo. But
the offer was later discounted by traders who concluded that
few nations would risk sending tankers to Iraq to pick up oil
in violation of the embargo.
   Then late in the trading day, after the close of the gold
market, rumors of new Middle East troop movements caused oil
prices to snap upward. Traders began buying oil contracts on
unconfirmed reports that Iraqi soldiers might be massing on
the Jordanian border -- a move that they reasoned could bring
Israel into conflict with Iraq since Jordan is all that
separates the two countries.
   In Washington, a Pentagon official said the U.S. hasn't
seen any signs of threatening Iraqi troop movements near
Jordan. The official said some Iraqi troops may have been
moved during training exercises, though.
   The price for crude for delivery during October jumped by
$1.26 to $31.30 a barrel, climbing almost as much as it had
fallen during earlier trading. Heating oil and gasoline
prices rose as well.
   Volatility appeared to be the dominant trading feature,
showing "how precariously balanced the oil market is," said
Lawrence Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
   Although the market focused mostly on Middle East action,
product prices also received some support from remarks made
by Calvin Kent, head of the Energy Department's Energy
Information Administration. He told a congressional hearing
in Washington that gasoline stocks were only 5.9 million
barrels above minimum operating inventory levels. If and when
that level is reached, there could be shortages of gasoline,
he told the lawmakers.
   Because gold trading ended just as the most volatile
rumors were surfacing, those prices missed most of the rally
that saw oil prices rebound.
   Gold for December delivery ended with a loss of $11.20 an
ounce at $384.80, after swinging over a $10 range. December
contracts were under pressure from the start in reaction to
the Helsinki summit, but some demand for contracts developed
because Saddam Hussein was scheduled to make a television
speech at 11:00 a.m. EDT. As a consequence, the December
contract rose to $391.60 an ounce, which was $4.40 below
Friday's close.
   But according to analysts, there was none of the
belligerency they feared in the Iraqi leader's statement and
December plunged to its low of the day of $381.60 an ounce.
   Peter Cardillo, director of futures research for Jesup
Josephthal, New York, observed that the Helsinki conference,
a strong dollar and weakness in platinum prices all
contributed to the price plunge in gold, which at its low was
showing a loss of $14.40 an ounce.
   The dollar rose against all foreign currencies except the
yen. Prices of all platinum contracts plunged their daily
permissible limit of $25 an ounce and then recovered only
slightly with the October contract settling at $457.50 an
ounce.
   About 20 minutes before trading in precious metals ended,
the oil rebound began, carrying gold with it. But gold
traders in the spot market apparently were unconvinced by the
advance in oil prices because gold in the noncontract market
didn't continue to climb.
   Oil traders and analysts predict that oil prices will
likely decline today unless the validity of rumors that drove
yesterday's market is confirmed.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices rallied in heavy
trading yesterday on a forecast of cold weather and rumors of
international events. "These markets are just very nervous
for any kind of news," said Daniel Basse, director of market
research for AgResource Co., Chicago. "This kind of price
movement is unusual just before harvest." Traders continued
to speculate that the U.S. may offer an aid package to the
Soviet Union for purchase of U.S. commodities, possibly
including wheat, soybean meal and corn. The prevailing rumor
was that President Bush may announce such a package when he
addresses Congress tonight. Any such increase in demand for
grain is likely to push futures prices higher. Meanwhile, one
Chicago weather forecaster's prediction of chilly weather and
a possible frost this weekend in the upper Midwest also
served to drive prices higher. The soybean crop is still
vulnerable and poor weather could reduce yields, analysts
said.
   A third factor exerting upward pressure on prices
yesterday was rumored movement of Iraqi troops along the
Jordanian border. Speculation that Iraq may invade Jordan
caused crude oil prices to rise sharply. That raised
inflationary concerns for grains, the production of which is
heavily dependent on petroleum products.
   A report released after the close of trading yesterday
showed a 6% reduction in the amount of soybeans in the
current crop thought to be in good condition, lending
credibility to previous worries that hot weather in the
Mississippi Delta growing region might damage the crop there.
The report may push futures prices higher today. In addition,
an important U.S. Agriculture Department crop production
report is due out after trading tomorrow. Analysts said that
report would be very closely watched.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices ended lower after fluctuating
widely. The most active December contract settled at 72.06
cents a pound, down 0.88 cent, after trading over a range of
1.55 cents. The soonest-to-expire October contract was off
1.08 cents to 72.58 cents, with a trading range of 1.40
cents. Selling developed in early trading following a report
that indicated yields of cotton being harvested in southern
Mississippi, a major cotton-growing state, were better than
expected, an analyst said. The crop had experienced a
prolonged drought during the growing season and there had
been concern about reduced production, he said. As prices
reached their day's lows, traders who had sold short began
buying back contracts to offset their positions. That buying
touched off a strong rally, which helped to partly recover
the early losses, according to the analyst.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined. The most actively traded
December contract ended with a loss of 2.05 cents a pound at
$1.2830. Some traders decided to take profits following
Friday's rally of more than seven cents a pound on concern
over production problems in various areas of the world, an
analyst said. A comment in Paris by the Peruvian energy and
mining minister that he expected the strike at Minero Peru
mine in Peru to end this week was also a price-depressing
factor, the analyst said. The Peruvian strike entered its
fourth week yesterday. A dealer noted that despite the
setback in futures, prices of the spot or soonest-to-expire
contracts on both the Commodity Exchange in New York and the
London Metal Exchange widened to greater premiums over more
deferred contracts. This action, he said, reflected a
continuing tightness of supplies of copper for delivery
against futures on the exchanges.
