   A set of class-action suits filed in 1986 by former
shareholders against MGM Entertainment Co., now MGM/UA
Communications Co., and its directors have been settled with
for up to $20 million.
   But at the same time, the Los Angeles-based entertainment
company and the directors filed a lawsuit against three
insurance carriers, claiming they acted in bad faith in
agreeing to the settlement. MGM/UA attorney Terry Christensen
called the insurers' action "a sneak attack."

   If approved Friday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge,
all defendants, including MGM/UA as a corporation, would be
dropped from the litigation except majority shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. The suits allege that when
MGM/UA was acquired by Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. in
1986, United Artists assets were sold back to Mr. Kerkorian
at an unfairly undervalued price, $470 million.
   The remaining litigation against Mr. Kerkorian, who is not
insured by the three companies, is set to go to trial in Los
Angeles Superior Court Sept. 24.
   The insurance concerns are Forum Insurance Co. of Chicago,
Associated International Insurance Co. of Los Angeles and
National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh.
