   Emerald Homes L.P. posted a second-quarter loss of $10.2
million, or $1.94 a unit, and said it is seeking capital to
help it restructure its debt and obtain new borrowings.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the Phoenix-based home
builder had net income of $478,000, or six cents a unit.
Revenue in the latest quarter plunged 39% to $13.3 million
from $21.9 million.

   Emerald said its loss included a $4.5 million reserve,
representing the full amount of Emerald's investment in Quail
Creek Country Club L.P., and a $2.4 million loss from the
sale of Homeplex Mortgage Investments Corp. common stock.
   "Our housing sales are still strong in Phoenix despite the
difficult real-estate market and slowing economy," said Lewis
J. Wright, president and chief executive officer. But Emerald
said it had an operating loss in the period due to slim
margins and to interest expense on land bought before Arizona
real-estate values fell.
   "We're hoping to restructure that debt," said James E.
Teiman, chief financial officer. Mr. Teiman said the
partnership is about $1 million in arrears on loan payments
to two financial institutions that have been taken over by
the Office of Thrift Supervision's Resolution Trust Corp.
Meanwhile, the company said it is having difficulty obtaining
construction financing.
