   LONDON -- British regulators restricted the use of Corwin,
a once-promising heart drug, as its manufacturer Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC withdrew a request for U.S. marketing
clearance.
   The actions underscore growing concern about the drug's
ill effects, arising largely from doctors misprescribing it
for serious heart failure rather than for milder forms of
heart failure. Some analysts believe ICI, a major U.K.
chemical and pharmaceutical maker, ultimately may withdraw
Corwin from the four countries where it's now sold. That
would mark a significant setback for ICI, because bullish
analysts had viewed the product as a blockbuster with
potential world-wide sales of $700 million.

   Britain's Committee on Safety of Medicines decided that
only hospital specialists should begin prescribing Corwin,
and solely for mild heart-failure patients after they've
undergone diagnostic exercise tests. In a letter sent to
doctors last month and released yesterday, the government
advisory panel described 191 reports of adverse reactions
from the medicine, generically known as xamoterol, since its
introduction nearly two years ago.
   The ill effects include worsened heart failure, a chronic
condition involving a decline in the heart's pumping power.
Other effects are dizziness and aggravation of diseases such
as emphysema and asthma. "We have had no reports of any
deaths at all" linked to Corwin, said a U.K. Department of
Health official.
   ICI has urged similar restrictions in its own letter to
physicians, but officials downplayed the significance of the
U.K. action and ICI's U.S. decision. "We still think there
are a great number of patients" who can be treated with
Corwin for mild heart failure, because 60% of heart-failure
patients "fall into the mild category," said Lynn Grant, a
spokeswoman.
   She emphasized that ICI yanked its U.S. marketing
application because it wants to collect more clinical data in
the U.S. ICI's decision to withdraw its request for U.S.
clearance "really wasn't related to these queries that have
come up" in Britain, she said, adding that ICI will proceed
with plans to launch the drug in Iceland and France, where it
has won initial approval, and pursue clearance in numerous
Asian and Latin American countries.
   Some physicians and analysts see much dimmer prospects for
Corwin. Andrew Herxheimer, a clinical pharmacologist here,
said, "The place for the drug in any country is in doubt." He
added: "There would be no loss to patients if this drug
didn't exist."
   Andrew Porter, a drug analyst at Nikko Securities Co.
here, noted that analysts' projected demand for Corwin has
steadily shrunk since reports of its ill effects began to
surface last year. "People are no longer excited about
Corwin," he said.
   Erling Refsum, a drug-industry analyst at Nomura Research
Institute here, said he wouldn't be surprised if ICI stopped
selling the drug entirely. He figures ICI currently reaps no
more than #10 million ($17 million) a year from sales of
Corwin world-wide. ICI's Ms. Grant said the actual number "is
a fraction of that, really," but she declined to be more
specific.
   Corwin won initial clearance in Britain, with use
recommended for patients with mild and moderate forms of
heart failure. It was seen as a possible successor to beta
blockers, heart medications whose development ICI pioneered.
"Corwin was supposed to be one of the great white hopes for a
follow-up to keep them {ICI} up in the world cardiovascular
league," Mr. Refsum recalled.
   But physicians' improper use of the drug among patients
with serious heart failure triggered a higher than expected
number of deaths. ICI wrote physicians about these findings
last summer, Ms. Grant said, and also strengthened warnings
against its use in severely ill patients. The new restriction
grew out of continued talks with the Committee on Safety, she
went on, and the company's belief that "there wasn't adequate
control over prescribing." It's often difficult for doctors
to distinguish between patients with moderate and severe
heart failure conditions.
