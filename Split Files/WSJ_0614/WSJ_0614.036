   NEW YORK -- The dollar fell against the mark, sterling and
Swiss franc, as those currencies were strengthened by a
number of factors.
   The mark benefited from an apparent softening of the
Soviet Union's previous opposition to a united Germany's
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in
addition to news that the Soviet Union is easing its economic
blockade of Lithuania.

   Continued speculation on the timing of Britain's full
entry into the European Monetary System drove the pound
through important resistance points, helping it close above
$1.7100. The Financial Times had reported Tuesday that the
government is preparing to take the pound into the EMS
exchange rate structure as early as September or October,
provided sterling is strong at that time.
   The pound was assisted by a Bank of England announcement
yesterday that it still wants to see base interest rates
remain at the current 15%. Relatively high interest rates
also were the reason for the Swiss franc's improvement
against the dollar, market participants said.
   Against the yen, however, the dollar bucked the day's
downward trend, rising slightly on a comment by U.S. Treasury
Undersecretary David Mulford that the dollar's current level
against the yen matches the one agreed upon by G-7 officials
at their meeting in May. (The Group of Seven consists of the
U.S., United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, West Germany, France and
Italy.)
   Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6865
marks, down from 1.6965 marks late Tuesday. The U.S. currency
also was changing hands at 154.75 yen, up from 154.55 yen.
Sterling was at $1.7115, up from $1.7035.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 154.05 yen
soon after opening at 153.90 yen; it closed Wednesday in
Tokyo at 154.55 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading
at about 1.6845 marks, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
1.6972 marks.
   Traders said the release earlier on Wednesday of figures
showing weak U.S. retail sales for May didn't have a lasting
impact on the dollar because the market was focused on
inflation numbers for May, scheduled for release today and
tomorrow. Retail sales fell 0.7% last month.
   Participants said the market remains sensitive to
political developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
as the July 2 date of German economic and social unification
approaches.
   That sensitivity was demonstrated by the strength the West
German currency derived from reports that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev has eased his position on the military
status of a unified Germany.
   That encouraged the market that the issue of German NATO
membership might not be as difficult to solve as had been
earlier supposed. The U.S. has steadfastly maintained that
one Germany will be a member of NATO, and the prospect of
Soviet opposition had caused nervousness that the issue could
hinder the process of unification.
   The apparent lessening of tensions between the Soviet
Union and Lithuania also aided the West German currency, said
Chris Manno, chief dealer at Midland Bank PLC in New York.
The Soviet government agreed to restore the supply of some
fuel and raw materials to Lithuania, which has been the
subject of a Soviet economic blockade aimed at forcing the
republic to rescind its declaration of independence. In
addition to rising against the dollar, the mark also recorded
noteworthy gains against the yen, rising to 91.76 yen from
91.10 yen Tuesday in New York.
   High interest rates powered the Swiss franc's extension of
gains against the dollar. The market interpreted Tuesday's
release of figures showing a 0.5% increase in Switzerland's
May cost-of-living index as a sign that Swiss monetary
authorities won't have room to ease rates significantly over
the short term. The increase in the index from April, when it
rose 0.2%, represented a 5.1% increase from the year-earlier
level.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $352 an ounce, down $3.70. This was the
lowest close since July 30, 1986. Estimated volume was a
moderate 3.7 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $350.20 an
ounce.
