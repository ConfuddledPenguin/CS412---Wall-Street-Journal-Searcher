   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange said it plans to
start "after-hours" trading later this year, and it may
expand to overnight trading in 1991.
   The plans for trading after traditional hours, under
discussion for two years, marked the first step in the Big
Board's slow evolution to electronic trading of stocks. The
exchange's specialists, or floor traders assigned to make
markets in individual stocks, won't participate physically in
an after-hours scheme, but they may share in the revenue.

   Current trading hours are from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Eastern time.
   The plans are sure to stir unrest on the Big Board floor.
Top specialists in recent weeks have said they didn't
anticipate that the Big Board would soon go ahead with
after-hours trading.
   But now the exchange seems anxious to give the impression
that it is moving forward in an area that many critics have
said it has been slow to pursue.
   The Big Board has seen an outflow of its traditional
trading business to overseas and to U.S. regional exchanges.
More important, the Big Board is facing strong competition
from an increasing array of electronic networks and private
dealers.
   A Big Board spokesman said the exchange is prepared to
"quickly put a system in place" for after-hours trading,
assuming the market wants one.
   The American Stock Exchange, industry executives said,
also has a number of electronic trading plans in the works.
It is close to announcing a new after-hours trading system
for options.
   Kenneth Leibler, president of the American exchange, said
after-hours trading is "clearly a trend of the 1990s. I think
globalization has been something widely discussed in the
'80s, and it will happen in the '90s. Extended trading is
probably something every market, depending on its product
mix, will probably participate in."
