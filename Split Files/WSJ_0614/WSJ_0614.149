   Cable &amp; Wireless also said Lord Young, former secretary of
state for the Department of Trade and Industry, is to become
executive chairman, succeeding Lord Sharp, who is to retire
Oct. 1. Lord Young headed the agency last June, when it
awarded Cable &amp; Wireless a license to develop and operate a
new generation of public mobile telephones for the 1990s.
   Fiscal 1990 profit after taxes and minority interests and
before special items rose 15% to #328 million from #285
million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose 12% to 31.3
pence from 27.9 pence. Gains of #487 million in the latest
period and #129 million a year earlier were from sales of
shares in a unit and associated companies. Profit
attributable to shareholders nearly doubled to #815 million
from #414 million.
