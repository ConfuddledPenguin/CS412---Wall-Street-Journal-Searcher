   SISTERSVILLE, W.Va. -- Wiser Oil Co. said it began
operating a natural gas liquids plant in Concho County,
Texas, to process gas from the company's Aqaritta oilfield.
   The plant is removing 7,500 gallons a day of natural gas
liquids from 1.2 million cubic feet a day of natural gas,
Wiser said. The gas is being reinjected into the field to
maintain pressure and enhance oil recovery.

   Wiser said that oil production from the field is 700
barrels a day, and that additional drilling will be required
to delineate the limits of the field. Wiser has a 62.5%
working interest and a 50% net revenue interest in the field.
