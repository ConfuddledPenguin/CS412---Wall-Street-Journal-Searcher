   Wilmington Trust Co. said it agreed to acquire Sussex
Trust Co. for $68 million, or $42.50 a share, in a tax-free
stock swap.
   Sussex Trust stockholders will receive between 1.037 and
1.149 shares of Wilmington Trust stock for each share of
Sussex stock, depending on the average market price of
Wilmington stock during the 20 days before the transaction
receives regulatory approval.

   Under the plan, a holding company for Wilmington Trust
will operate the two banks. They will remain Wilmington Trust
Co. in northern Delaware and Sussex Trust in Southern
Delaware.
   Sussex has $420 million in assets and 20 locations in the
state.
