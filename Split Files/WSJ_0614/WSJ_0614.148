   Barclays Bank PLC said yesterday it plans to raise $100
million through an issue of preference shares to U.S.
investors.
   The British bank said the fixed-rate, noncumulative
dollar-denominated preference shares will be redeemable at
the option of the bank in 10 years.

   Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer of Barclays, said the
bank may raise more than the level announced depending upon
market reaction.
   He noted that Barclays's entry into the U.S.
preference-share market last year began with a planned $200
million issue, but eventually it blossomed to $500 million
after strong interest was shown among investors.
   And he added that Barclays has the ability to raise
additional dollar capital under a shelf registration filed a
number of months ago with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, notifying the SEC that it planned to raise up to
$500 million through additional preference shares.
