   Rock reviewers in New York City are doing some nimble
writing about Madonna's "Blond Ambition" concert, in which
she performed in a "dominatrix" outfit, is attended on a red
velvet bed by male dancers and kicks on the ground her two
female backup singers, among other things. One local critic
wrote: "She pushed the limits of morality but never once went
over the edge." Maybe theologians should be reviewing this
show.
