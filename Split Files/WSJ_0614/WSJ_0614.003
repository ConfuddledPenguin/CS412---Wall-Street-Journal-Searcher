   WASHINGTON -- A House Judiciary subcommittee approved
legislation that would repeal crucial aspects of the
insurance industry's 45-year-old exemption from federal
antitrust law.
   The Democratic-supported bill, approved yesterday by a 9-6
party-line vote, would eliminate insurers' exemptions for
price-fixing, attempting to monopolize markets, allocating
territories among rival firms, and forcing consumers to
purchase packages of unrelated types of policies. These
practices are generally viewed by lawyers and economists as
among the most egregious antitrust violations.

   Although it is only an early step in the legislative
process, the subcommittee action was significant. The
legislation would amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945,
which has provided the $500 billion insurance industry with
broad protection from federal antitrust enforcement. Only
once before, in 1988, has such a modification of
McCarran-Ferguson received subcommittee approval, and that
bill died without moving further.
   Under the current legislation, sponsored by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas, insurers would be
allowed to continue certain types of information-sharing on
claims and other economic trends that would be deemed illegal
in other industries. Moreover, insurers would remain
insulated from federal enforcement in states where state
officials actively regulate the industry.
   The bill would "prohibit only the most pernicious offenses
-- like price-fixing -- unless the states take real
responsibility for regulating the industry," Rep. Brooks
said. The prohibitions would take effect after a five-year
"transition period."
   The full House Judiciary Committee, which Mr. Brooks also
chairs, is expected to consider his bill this summer. If it
receives the committee's approval, as expected, a tough floor
fight could follow this fall. The Senate is moving more
slowly on a different bill designed to repeal aspects of
McCarran-Ferguson.
   Some lawmakers have tried for years to repeal the
McCarran-Ferguson exemptions, arguing that they limit
competition and drive up premium prices. But the insurance
industry, which claims the exemptions permit "stability" and
thus reduce rates, has skillfully orchestrated sufficient
opposition to block such efforts.
   While insurers generally continue to oppose modification
of McCarran-Ferguson, some major firms have lately conceded
that they would survive with less special protection.
   Wilson Taylor, chairman of Cigna Corp., for example, said
in a speech to an insurance trade group that it is time to
"shake off the status quo and take some bold steps toward
change and compromise" on McCarran-Ferguson, among other
issues.
   John P. Mascotte, chairman of Continental Corp., said,
"I'm not calling for repeal {of the antitrust exemptions},
but it is time to carefully re-examine McCarran-Ferguson and
see what the industry needs in the way of regulation and then
ask if McCarran is the most effective way of doing that."
   Before the House subcommittee approved the Brooks bill
yesterday, it voted 14-1 against a proposal by Rep. Tom
Campbell (R., Calif.) to repeal McCarran-Ferguson entirely.
Mr. Campbell, a former Stanford University law professor and
something of a maverick on antitrust issues, ultimately voted
against the Brooks bill.
   In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission, which
shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department, has
recommended total repeal of McCarran-Ferguson. James Rill,
the Justice Department's antitrust chief, is known to favor
repeal of at least some of the McCarran-Ferguson protections,
but the Bush administration hasn't taken a public position on
the politically charged issue.
