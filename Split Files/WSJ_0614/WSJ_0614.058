   BRUSSELS -- Five European Community countries are to sign
an accord removing all immigration controls among them,
allowing people to travel freely in an area covering almost
half the area of the EC.
   The accord -- expected to take full effect by the end of
1991 and link France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg -- was approved by the West German cabinet.
Signing ceremonies will be held next Tuesday in a small
Luxembourg village called Schengen, a border village that
gave the accord its name because of its close proximity to
neighboring France and Germany.

   The agreement is considered important to overall efforts
to remove border controls among the EC's twelve member
countries. Removing passport controls has become one of the
most concrete symbols of European integration, and could make
life and business much simpler for the millions of people who
live along Continental Europe's copious collection of
borders.
   The agreement is the first major international accord that
treats East and West Germany as a single country. The five
countries had planned to sign the agreement last December,
but the West German cabinet refused to approve it because of
concerns about East Germany.
   Now that German unification is no longer in question, the
five nations agreed to include East Germany in territory
covered by the Schengen accord. East German officials helped
in the negotiations, and the participants agreed that
Schengen territory will extend East to the Polish border at
the Oder and Neisse Rivers.
   The accord is seen as a major building block for the new
architecture that the EC hopes will bind the EC nations ever
closer in coming years. The Schengen countries will open
negotiations with Italy later this month to bring a sixth
country into the Schengen group; Spain and Portugal are
expected to try to join soon after.
   While full details of the accord won't be released until
Tuesday, the agreement does provide for strengthened measures
to fight cross-border crime, drug trafficking and illegal
immigration. It will establish a common list of countries
that require visas to visit the Schengen countries. The
accord also will ease some customs controls on goods, though
complete removal of such controls will have to await an
EC-wide agreement on value-added-tax harmonization.
   The accord still has to be approved by the parliaments of
the five countries. But public support for the agreement is
so strong that most political analysts say they expect the
five countries to race to see which can put it into effect
soonest. When the talks collapsed in December, many Europeans
saw it as a bad sign for the whole European unity movement.
"Amazingly, most of the objections seem to have gone away in
the past five months," said Lieven Lenaerts, Secretary
General of the Benelux Economic Union, which links Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and which has been in charge
of the Schengen negotiations.
   Nevertheless, the EC's own attempt to remove border
controls for people has proved one of the most difficult of
all its plans for a border-free Europe, mainly because of
concerns about criminals, terrorists and drug dealers.
Currently, most European police forces rely on border checks
as a major way of fighting crime.
   To deal with the crime problem, the Schengen countries
will create an extensive data network to share information
about suspected criminals and other police intelligence. That
system, which will be based in Strasbourg, France, should
come into full operation by the end of 1991, Mr. Lenaerts
said.
   Belgium, which hasn't any law protecting access to
electronic data kept on file about its citizens, has promised
to pass new legislation before the agreement comes into full
effect.
   The Schengen agreement could create new headaches for
travelers outside the five-nation area. The external borders
of the Schengen countries will be more strictly controlled
than national borders are currently, experts say, mainly
because officials would perform the immigration controls for
all the rest of the Schengen countries. But once a person is
admitted to one of the Schengen countries he would be able to
pass freely throughout the others.
   For this reason, most countries on the Continent are
expected to come under heavy pressure from travelers and
businesses to become signatories to the Schengen accord.
