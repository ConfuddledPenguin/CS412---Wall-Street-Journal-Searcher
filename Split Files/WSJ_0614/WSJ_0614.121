   Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it filed for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Seattle-based Olympia, which had a 1989 loss of $11
million on revenue of $15.8 million, had been deteriorating
for months and had met little success in attempts to sell
radio stations to raise money.

   The company listed assets of $21.9 million and liabilities
of $38 million. It said the filing also covers one subsidiary
but does not include Olympia Broadcasting Networks unit, its
radio networks unit, or any of the units that own the radio
stations.
