   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed lower as late
futures-related selling and profit-taking set the direction
for a market that had shown little reaction to an
unexpectedly weak report on the economy.
   Banking issues were hit especially hard amid renewed
worries about the group's earnings prospects, stemming from
news of a double-digit increase in nonperforming assets last
month at HomeFed and MNC Financial's expectation that real
estate weakness would hurt its results.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.47 to 2929.95
despite heavy buying in three of its component issues --
International Business Machines, American Express and Boeing.
Over the week's first two sessions, the 30-stock average had
soared a total of 71.04 points.
   Stocks shrugged off a bond market rally in response to
news of a 0.7% drop in May retail sales, which analysts had
generally expected to remain unchanged. Prices of Treasury
notes and bonds jumped as much as 7/8-point.
   While bond market players focused on the sales data's
implications for interest rates -- specifically, the
possibility that the Federal Reserve may be more inclined to
ease monetary policy -- worries about the corporate earnings
outlook if the economy remains sluggish held stocks in check.
   Trading remained moderate. About 158,910,000 shares were
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with
157,100,000 Tuesday.
   Among broader market averages, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index lost 1.35 to 364.90, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 0.66 to 199.00 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index dropped 1.16 to 339.82. Declining issues topped
advancers by 786 to 722 on the Big Board.
   After a directionless morning, buying and selling tied to
stock-index arbitrage whipped share prices in both directions
over the course of the afternoon.
   Index-arbitrage buy programs, in which traders purchase
baskets of stocks and sell index-futures contracts to profit
from price differences between them, pushed the market higher
at midafternoon.
   But program selling subsequently wiped out those gains
after the futures dropped to levels at which arbitrage
involving the sale of stocks and the purchase of index
futures could be done profitably.
   American Express climbed 1 to 31 3/8 in Big Board
composite trading of 1.9 million shares in the face of news
that it plans a public offering of 27 million new common
shares. As expected, Nippon Life Insurance of Japan agreed to
buy about 10 million of the shares.
   IBM climbed 1 1/8 to 121 3/8, near its 52-week high of 122
1/4, as 2.2 million shares changed hands. Boeing gained 7/8
to 59 3/4 and peaked at 60 3/4, a 52-week high; composite
volume of 2.3 million shares put the stock first on the Big
Board's most-active list.
   HomeFed plummeted 8 1/4 to 25 after its primary unit
reported that nonperforming assets went up more than 16% in
May, to $579 million. The increase was disclosed before the
session started; trading in the stock didn't begin on the Big
Board until more than four hours after the opening.
   Other savings-and-loan stocks also posted sharp losses.
Great Western Financial tumbled 1 5/8 to 18 7/8, Golden West
Financial dropped 1 7/8 to 31 3/8 and H.F. Ahmanson slipped 1
to 21 1/4.
   Shares of big city banks moved lower across the board.
Citicorp slid 1/2 to 23 5/8, BankAmerica fell 7/8 to 32,
Chase Manhattan went down 3/4 to 25 1/4, J.P. Morgan fell 7/8
to 37 1/4 and Manufacturers Hanover slipped 3/4 to 35 3/4.
   MNC Financial, which said softness in real estate markets
where it has a significant number of loans outstanding is
likely to hurt second-quarter results, dropped 1 1/2 to 15
1/8. The company didn't provide any specific forecasts.
   Among other bank issues, Bank of New York fell 7/8 to 36,
Banc One lost 1 1/8 to 30 3/4, First Fidelity Bancorp dropped
1 1/4 to 21, NCNB slid 1 1/8 to 40 3/8, PNC Financial fell 1
3/8 to 34 3/4 and Wells Fargo fell 2 3/8 to 81 5/8.
   Tandem Computers, which fell 5/8 Tuesday as the broad
market rallied, dropped another 5/8 to 24 3/8 on 1.8 million
shares. The company said that at least four brokerage houses
-- Prudential-Bache Securities, Dean Witter Reynolds,
Montgomery Securities and SoundView Financial Group -- had
lowered their estimates this week of earnings for the fiscal
quarter ending in June. Tandem declined to comment on the
revised forecasts.
   Woolworth fell 3/4 to 33 3/4. The company raised its
planned cash capital spending for the current fiscal year by
$40 million to reflect an increase in the number of stores it
expects to open.
   Prime Motor Inns skidded 1 3/8 to 11 1/2. The company
agreed to sell its entire Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise
systems for $170 million to Blackstone Capital Partners,
which had previously agreed to acquire a 65% stake in the two
systems for $140 million.
   Compaq Computer went up 2 1/4 to 125 1/4 and set a 52-week
high by peaking at 126 1/4 amid speculation that it would
soon unveil a new version of its laptop computers, and
possibly other products.
   Black &amp; Decker gained 3/4 to 16 on 1.3 million shares.
Chairman Nolan D. Archibald and three other company insiders
purchased shares in April and May, according to Securities
and Exchange Commission filings, and a total of nine insiders
have been buyers so far this year.
   Warrants of RJR Nabisco Holdings rose 1/4 to 7 1/8 and
traded as high as 7 3/4. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts plans to
inject about $1.7 billion in cash, raised from the buy-out
firm's investors, into the company in an attempt to bolster
RJR's bonds.
   McDermott International climbed 1 1/8 to 31 3/4. Chairman
Robert Howson spoke favorably about the company's
marine-construction business in an appearance at an
investment conference in New York.
   Mylan Laboratories gained 1 to 22 5/8. The company said
its management met with the Food and Drug Administration,
which had found problems at its Morgantown, W.Va., plant
during an April inspection, and it won't have to recall any
products.
   Seagull Energy added 1 5/8 to 28 3/8. Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
and Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. reiterated buy recommendations on
the stock in response to the company's signing of a letter of
intent to buy Wacker Oil for about $77 million.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.73
to 365.04. Volume totaled 13,400,000.
   GW Utilities rose 1 3/8 to 30 3/8. Olympia &amp; York
Developments said it plans to boost its offer for the GW
shares it doesn't already own to 40 Canadian dollars
(US$34.12) a share from C$36.
