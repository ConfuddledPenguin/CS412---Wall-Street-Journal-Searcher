   TCS Enterprises Inc., San Diego, posted a net loss of
$61,000, or two cents a share, for the second quarter, ended
April 30, and said it expects lower earnings for the rest of
the fiscal year.
   In the year-earlier second quarter, the financial and
business services company earned $538,000, or 17 cents a
share.

<TEXT>
   Tom C. Stickel, chairman and chief executive officer, said
that the second-quarter loss resulted from "a reduction in
income from real estate-related projects from last year's
second quarter versus this year." He added that the lower
earnings for the year will result from "a substantial
increase in capital expenditures as we further develop our
publishing efforts."
