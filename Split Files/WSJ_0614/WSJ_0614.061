   DETROIT -- U.S. auto sales continued on a downward spiral
as sales of domestic cars and trucks fell 13.1% in early
June.
   The Big Three U.S. auto makers accounted for all of the
market's decline. The seven major Japanese auto makers who
build cars in the U.S. all reported sales gains, although
some of those increases were related to higher domestic
production this year.

   Car dealers said consumer demand continues to be spotty.
Consumers are snapping up some newer models like Ford Motor
Co.'s Explorer sport utility vehicle introduced in March and
General Motors Corp.'s new 1991 four-door Buick Regal
introduced June 4. But other lines, particularly those that
have been carried over with relatively little change from
this past year, are lagging. Sales of Chevrolet's
Beretta-Corsica compact cars, for example, plunged 24% in the
period.
   "You've got to have something different from everybody
else. Having the new models helps," said Ed Polito, new car
manager at William Lehman Buick Inc., Miami. Sales of the
1990 two-door version of the Regal, for example, are
"sluggish" compared with the new four-door model, even though
the discount package on the coupe is $500 more generous than
that on the sedan, he said.
   Overall, Americans bought 243,297 domestic cars and trucks
in the eight selling days of the June 1-10 period. In the
nine selling days a year earlier, sales totaled 314,942
vehicles. The percentage change is based on the daily sales
rate.
   U.S.-built passenger cars sold at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 6.3 million units in the period, according to
a U.S. Department of Commerce formula. That lagged behind
both the 7.2 million-car rate a year ago and the 7.3 million
rate for late May.
   The weak sales in the recent period suggest consumers are
putting up some resistance to auto makers' efforts to cut
back on the heavy discounts that depressed profits earlier
this year. Car makers have relatively lean inventories now,
but the companies are hoping to boost production later this
year. Those beefed-up schedules could come under pressure if
sales don't pick up.
   Among the Big Three, Chrysler had the worst early June
performance. Combined sales of Chrysler cars and trucks fell
20.1% from a year ago. Sales of Chrysler cars skidded 18.3%,
while sales of the auto maker's trucks, minivans and Jeeps
fell 22%.
   Ford posted a 0.5% increase in domestic truck sales
largely attributed to a doubling in sales of the new Explorer
sport utility and discontinued Bronco II compact sport
utility vehicles. But the No. 2 auto maker's total car sales
fell 20.6% during the latest 10 days.
   GM's domestic car sales were off 19.2%, as the Cadillac
luxury division was the only one of five GM car divisions to
post a gain from a year ago. GM's domestic truck sales fell
11.3% in early June from a year earlier.
   Japanese auto makers who build and sell cars in the U.S.
continued to show gains over a year ago. Toyota Motor Corp.
boosted sales of its domestically built Camry and Corolla
models by 35%. Sales of Honda Motor Co.'s U.S.-built Accords
and Civics rose 30.8%.
   Nissan Motor Co. posted a 30.5% increase in domestic car
sales but reported a modest 1.1% gain in trucks.
   At Mitsubishi Motors Corp., sales of U.S.-made cars jumped
59%, largely reflecting low production a year ago.
