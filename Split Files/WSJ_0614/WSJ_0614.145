   Corporacion Mapfre S.A., Spain's leading insurer, said in
Madrid that it agreed to buy a majority stake in Puerto
Rico's biggest insurance group from Continental Corp. of the
U.S. for $100 million.
   Mapfre officials said the purchase is Mapfre's biggest
foreign acquisition to date and is part of a strategy to
expand the group's trans-Atlantic operations. More than half
of Mapfre's international business is in Latin America; it
also has a small operation in the U.S. It plans to use its
Puerto Rican presence to expand its activities in the U.S.

   Under the agreement with Continental, Mapfre plans to set
up a subsidiary in Puerto Rico to take a stake in the
insurance business of Puerto Rican American Insurance Co, or
Praico, and in some of its assets and liabilities.
   The Praico assets concerned include two subsidiaries,
Preferred Risk, a general insurance company, and Security
National Life Insurance Co., a life insurance specialist.
   Simultaneously, Mapfre's subsidiary Mapfre Internacional
will take a majority stake in Panamerican Corp., a holding
company that controls Pan American Insurance Co, Pan American
Finance Corp. and Puerto Rican Insurance Agency.
   Together, these firms form the Praico group, Puerto Rico's
biggest insurer with gross 1989 premium revenues of $83.5
million. Mapfre said it plans to finance the investment
through an issue of new shares.
