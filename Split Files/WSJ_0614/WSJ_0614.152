   THE SOVIET UNION AGREED to ease an economic embargo of
Lithuania.
   Breaking a deadlock, Moscow said it would restore some
fuel and raw-material shipments to the breakaway republic.
The two-month embargo, imposed in response to a Lithuanian
independence declaration, was eased as the republic's premier
met in Moscow with Kremlin officials. Meanwhile, the Soviet
Parliament told the government to refine its economic
restructuring program, but endorsed the thrust of it. An
official said a threefold rise in bread prices would be
postponed.
