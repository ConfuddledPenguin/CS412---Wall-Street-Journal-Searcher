   Hurt by costs that rose faster than its income, KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines reported final figures that showed that its
profit in the year ended March 30, dropped 8% to 340 million
guilders ($178 million) from 370 million guilders.
   In terms of its per-share profit, KLM reported that this
figure declined 9.1% to 6.43 guilders from 7.08 guilders.

   Although KLM reported that its revenue in the most recent
fiscal year rose by 8.2% to 6.46 billion guilders from the
year-earlier level of 5.97 billion guilders, this advance was
outstripped by a rise in costs of 10% to 6.150 billion
guilders from 5.581 billion guilders.
