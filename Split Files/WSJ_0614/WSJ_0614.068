   WASHINGTON -- The International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization said it would pay NASA about $90
million to retrieve a stranded telecommunications satellite
and boost it into higher orbit.
   The rescue is scheduled for February 1992, said the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, during the
first flight of a new space shuttle, called Endeavour.
According to the plan, the shuttle will snag the Intelsat-6
satellite with its robot arm and bring it into the shuttle's
cargo bay. There astronauts will attach a new rocket motor
that the shuttle will lug into space. The satellite then will
be lifted out of the shuttle and sent into an orbit 22,300
miles above the Earth.

   The mission recalls the glory days of the shuttle, before
the Challenger disaster, when NASA retrieved or repaired four
satellites and expected to make a business out of it. But
NASA's plans have changed drastically since then -- the
shuttle flies far less frequently than hoped for, and it
doesn't carry commercial cargoes -- so the planned retrieval
probably won't be a precursor to other work.
   But NASA was happy to accept the Intelsat offer anyway.
Space Shuttle Director Robert Crippen said the mission would
help NASA in planning for the construction in space of its
proposed orbiting space station. It would also "once again
demonstrate the versatility of the space shuttle," he said.
   Intelsat, a global telecommunications consortium, began
investigating the possibility of a retrieval after a Martin
Marietta Corp. rocket boosted the $157 million satellite into
a useless orbit in March. Martin Marietta later said it had
messed up the wiring on its $115 million Titan III booster.
   Intelsat, which had self-insured the project, said that
retrieving the satellite would be cheaper than building and
launching a new one. The telecommunications organization said
that it expects the reboosted satellite, which will carry
telephone calls, television and computer data, to last 10
years.
   The Intelsat decision was a setback for Orbital Sciences
Corp., a Fairfax, Va., rocket company that had hoped to sell
Intelsat one of its satellite rocket motors and had
publicized a prospective rescue mission. Instead, Intelsat
chose a motor built by Hughes Aircraft Co., the General
Motors Corp. subsidiary that built the satellite.
   NASA charges $150 million for cargo that fills up the
entire shuttle bay. The space agency said it figured that the
satellite rocket motor would take up about 60% of the shuttle
cargo, resulting in a charge of between $90 million and $97
million. That pricing scheme has long been controversial with
commercial space advocates. They say it underestimates the
true cost of operating the space shuttle, which they put at
about $350 million, and represents unfair competition.
