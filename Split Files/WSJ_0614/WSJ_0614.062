   Joe Davidson did a disservice to your readers and some
fine public servants in his article regarding an alleged
"messy turf war" at the Federal Housing Finance Board ("Messy
Turf War Frustrates New Housing Agency That's Supposed to
Help Lower-Income Buyers," Politics and Policy, April 17). He
implied that in the less-than-seven-month history of this
agency, actions and programs were mired down by infighting
between the Finance Board and HUD. I am happy to set the
record straight.
   First, the Finance Board is an agency that just came into
existence last October, just two months after the enactment
of FIRREA, the savings-and-loan bill. President Bush has
nominated two of the four board members -- Dan Evans as
chairman and Larry Costiglio as a board member. Both are
awaiting Senate confirmation. As provided by law, until the
confirmation of other board members, I, as HUD secretary,
serve as board chairman and have the legal responsibility to
exercise all duties and powers of the Finance Board until Mr.
Evans is confirmed as chairman.

   I was particularly disappointed by your characterization
of the status of our affordable-housing program, by which the
Federal Home Loan Banks are providing subsidized mortgages
for low- and moderate-income home buyers. In just four
months, the Finance Board published regulations for this
program that became effective March 2. This followed numerous
meetings with the Federal Home Loan Banks, interested
community and housing consumer organizations and
congressional staff over the scope and design of the program,
as well as administration-wide review and clearance. This is
about as fast as government rule-making can occur. Moreover,
each of the Federal Home Loan Banks has held several meetings
with its consumer advisory councils, member institutions and
others to get the word out about the availability of these
funds. Applications are rolling in, and we expect to approve
our first loans soon.
   The Finance Board has performed numerous other functions,
including assessing the banks for more than $1.5 billion of
funds for the thrift bailout, approving budgets and
establishing dividend policies for the banks and approving $3
billion to $5 billion every month in new mortgage money for
savings and loans nationwide.
   The Federal Housing Finance Board has an important
contribution to make toward this goal and, if I may say so,
is already well on its way to doing so. I trust your readers
will appreciate our efforts, and will not be influenced by
Mr. Davidson's erroneous conclusions, notwithstanding his
reportorial skills.
