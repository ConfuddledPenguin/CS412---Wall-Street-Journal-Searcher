   WASHINGTON -- The government agency that insures pension
plans delivered a good-news, bad-news message to Congress.
   The good news, said James Lockhart, executive director of
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., is that the agency "could
be solvent in a few years" if several major pension cases it
is negotiating or litigating go its way. Currently, the
agency has a deficit of about $1 billion.

   But the bad news is that the agency's deficit could
balloon to as much as $7.8 billion if it sustains major
losses in those cases, Mr. Lockhart warned in testimony
before the House Ways and Means Committee's oversight
subcommittee.
   Despite recent statutory changes designed to strengthen
the federal pension insurance program, including a sharp
boost in insurance premiums paid by pension plans, the agency
"still has problems that may require further reform," Mr.
Lockhart said. The Bush administration is reviewing issues
confronting the agency, and it may recommend legislative
action early next year, he said.
   Meantime, he said he hopes that the pension agency, the
Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration and the Treasury Department can work with
Congress to simplify pension regulations.
   The insurance program and the defined-benefit plans it
insures may be too complicated, Mr. Lockhart said. He said
the complexity may be a reason why the number of pension-plan
participants covered by defined-benefit plans has declined.
Under defined-benefit plans, employers guarantee a certain
level of retirement benefits for retirees.
   Two of the pension cases that concern the agency involve
LTV Corp. The PBGC has been locked in a long-running legal
battle over a decision by the steel company, which is in
bankruptcy proceedings, to terminate several of its pension
plans and stick the agency with responsibility for $2.2
billion in the funds' liabilities.
   An appeals court ruled in favor of LTV, and the Supreme
Court is expected to rule on the matter any day now. The PBGC
argues that LTV is trying to use agency insurance payments as
a corporate subsidy, and officials worry that a high-court
ruling for LTV would set a precedent for other bankrupt firms
to take the same tack.
   In the other LTV case, a New York federal bankruptcy court
recently disallowed any priority for PBGC claims over those
of other creditors and rejected the agency's authority to
determine employer liability for pension underfunding. Mr.
Lockhart said the agency is challenging the bankruptcy
court's ruling, which he said could limit the agency's
ability to collect on its claims.
   He also voiced concerns about employer attempts to shift
plan liabilities to weaker sponsors while in corporate
reorganization; lack of employer funding for plant-shutdown
benefits, which sometimes are guaranteed by the PBGC; and
rules that let firms with inadequately backed plans pay out
more in benefits than they must contribute to those plans the
same year.
   The agency is trying to protect the insurance program by
encouraging better employer funding of pension plans,
discouraging termination of underfunded plans and maximizing
its recoveries when plans are ended, Mr. Lockhart said. He
said the agency uses such tools as liens, along with tougher
negotiating, to reduce its liability.
