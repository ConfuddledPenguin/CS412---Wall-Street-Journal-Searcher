   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. has quietly put its $30 million
Nuprin pain reliever ad account up for review.
   A Bristol-Myers spokesman confirmed late yesterday that
"we are in the process of reviewing Nuprin advertising, and
we are speaking to several agencies." He said Grey
Advertising, which currently handles the ad account for the
"little, yellow" pain pills, "will have the opportunity to
compete" for the business. He declined to identify the other
agencies involved, but industry executives said that among
them are WPP Group's Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J. Walter Thompson
units, neither of which handles Bristol-Myers brands in the
U.S.

   While big in itself, the Nuprin account could prove even
more significant than its billings would suggest: The account
could open the door for the agency that wins it to pick up
other Bristol-Myers business, industry executives said. "I
don't think they're going to select an agency without knowing
it can take on more business," said one executive involved in
the pitch.
   Bristol-Myers was the 21st-largest U.S. advertiser last
year, spending about $430 million, according to Advertising
Age, a trade publication. Among its brands are Excedrin,
Bufferin, Clairol and Drano.
   The huge pharmaceutical company decided to put the account
up for review about a month ago, prompted largely by Nuprin's
disappointing sales. Nuprin is ibuprofen, the same drug that
also goes by the brand name Advil from American Home
Products. But despite Bristol-Myers's heavy promotion of the
brand -- and despite Grey's distinctive black-and-white
commercials with only the yellow pills in color -- Nuprin has
lagged far behind market leader Advil.
   "At this time, the brand isn't growing at a rate that is
satisfactory to us," the Bristol-Myers spokesman said. "We
want the strongest possible advertising support." He didn't
say when a decision would be made, but industry executives
believe it will be in the next few weeks.
   According to Hemant K. Shah, an analyst with HKS &amp; Co. in
Warren, N.J., Nuprin's share of the ibuprofen market has been
steadily sliding. At the end of 1984, the year that Nuprin
was introduced, it had a 30% share of a $55 million market.
By last year, the ibuprofen market had grown to $500 million,
but Nuprin's share had plummeted to 16%, a distant second to
Advil's almost 55% share. Mr. Shah estimated that while the
total market will grow to close to $600 million this year,
Nuprin's growth again won't match that rate, and its share
will slip below 15%.
   Bristol-Myers "did try to promote {Nuprin} very
agressively last year, but apparently it didn't work," Mr.
Shah said. Nuprin's ad budget also lagged behind that of
Advil, which spent $48 million last year, according to
Leading National Advertisers. Nuprin has been buffeted, too,
by the entry of Upjohn's Motrin IB, another ibuprofen
medication that once had been prescription-only.
   The review may also reflect some personnel changes at
Bristol-Myers. Grey had a close relationship with Ronald A.
Ahrens, who had been president of the Bristol-Myers Products
unit and then president of the parent company's North
American consumer products group. The review began after Mr.
Ahrens resigned in April.
   Winning the Nuprin account would be a huge boost for
Ogilvy, whose New York office just recently broke a two-year
losing streak when it picked up the $45 million Eastern
Airlines account. Ogilvy also is competing for a piece of the
Xerox account. Executives at both Ogilvy and Thompson
declined to comment.
   In addition to Nuprin, Grey also handles Bristol-Myers's
Ultress, Miss Clairol, Windex and Drano brands, among others.
Grey declined to comment.

   McCann-Erickson Worldwide said it set up a joint venture
with Creworld Advertising, an agency in Seoul. In what McCann

McCann will hold a majority ownership of the new shop. The
shop will be renamed McCann-Erickson. Terms of the venture
weren't disclosed.
   Several other agencies, including Backer Spielvogel Bates,
already have joint ventures in Korea, but those shops hold
only minority ownership positions.
