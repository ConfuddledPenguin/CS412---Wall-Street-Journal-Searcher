   WASHINGTON -- An emotional plea for compassion and
clemency by Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.) brought the
ethics committee hearings in his case to an abrupt close
after only two days.
   Speaking to two distinct audiences -- the people of
Minnesota and the six members of the ethics panel -- Sen.
Durenberger repeatedly apologized for mistakes, both "actions
and inactions," in his financial dealings. But he stressed
that he had acted "in good faith," relying on the advice of
outside lawyers, and that he had no intent to break Senate
rules. He urged the panel to reject the harsh punishment of
denunciation -- the equivalent of censure -- recommended
Tuesday by the committee's special counsel, Robert Bennett.

   "My life and reputation are at stake," Mr. Durenberger
told the ethics committee, of which he was once a member.
   During an hour-long address, the senator recounted the
personal and financial problems that led him into a
questionable book promotion deal and real-estate transaction.
He told of his first wife's death of cancer at age 31 and the
subsequent problems he had raising four young sons. He also
emphasized the financial burdens of maintaining two
households, in Minnesota and Washington.
   "During that costly period of family life that I was
ill-prepared for, I had a real financial squeeze," Mr.
Durenberger explained.
   In a move that seemed to surprise the ethics panel, Sen.
Durenberger decided not to call any witnesses or offer
further testimony in his defense. Mr. Durenberger and his
attorney said some sanction is appropriate in his case but
something less severe than denunciation. They urged the
committee to move quickly to the punishment phase of the
proceedings.
   Accepting the senator's request, the committee
short-circuited the hearings, which were originally scheduled
to last two weeks. "There is not a great deal of dispute
about the facts" in the case, observed Sen. Warren Rudman
(R., N.H.), the vice chairman of the panel, "but about what
those facts mean."
   Mr. Bennett must now prepare a report summarizing the
evidence in the case before the committee can deliberate and
vote on a recommended punishment. Mr. Bennett said he hoped
to complete the report in two weeks. If the panel recommends
that Sen. Durenberger be denounced, a majority of the full
Senate would have to approve the sanction.
