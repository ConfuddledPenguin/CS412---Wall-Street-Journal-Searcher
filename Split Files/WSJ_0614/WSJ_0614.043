   AMERICAN CLAIMS EVALUATION Inc., Jericho, N.Y., declared a
2-for-1 stock split, payable Aug. 14 to stock of record July
10. The company reviews hospital bills for insurers and for
self-insured companies. American has 930,000 shares
outstanding, about half of which are held by Gary Gelman,
president and chief executive officer. Robert E. Lindberg,
executive vice president, said directors declared the split
to put more shares on the market at a lower price and reach
more retail investors. For the year ended March 31, American
reported net income more than tripled to $520,517, or 52
cents a share, as revenue rose 62% to $4.4 million. In
over-the-counter trading yesterday, the shares were quoted at
$10 bid, down 25 cents.
