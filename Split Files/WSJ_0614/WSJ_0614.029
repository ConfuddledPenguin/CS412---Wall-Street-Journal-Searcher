   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Imhausen-Chemie G.m.b.H.'s
former head, Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, admitted he
illegally delivered sophisticated equipment and technical
plans to Libya for a chemical plant in Rabta, a suspected
chemical-weapons site.
   Mr. Hippenstiel, charged with violations of West German
export laws and tax evasion, claimed full responsibility at
his trial yesterday in Mannheim District Court. Peter
Wechsung, a senior prosecutor, said Mr. Hippenstiel also
admitted to avoiding taxation on Imhausen's nearly 20 million
marks ($11.8 million) in profit from the transaction. The
money was invested in dummy companies in Hong Kong.

   Libya maintains that the plant produces medicine. But the
prosecutor's 100-page indictment accuses the 49-year-old
defendant of helping to build a chemical-weapons plant in
Rabta. "He didn't confirm this, but he also didn't deny it,"
Mr. Wechsung said. Prosecutors hope to receive confirmation
of the plant's purpose later in the trial.
   Mr. Hippenstiel referred to the Rabta facility as a
"chemical plant." Mr. Wechsung said Mr. Hippenstiel explained
he was withholding further details for reasons of personal
safety.
   Mr. Hippenstiel's admission added a new chapter to the
alleged violation of West Germany's export controls by
exporters of technology useful in weapons production.
Embarrassed by the Imhausen scandal and pressured by the U.S.
to crack down on arms exporters, the Bonn government spent a
year crafting tougher export measures, which are expected to
be passed into law within a few weeks.
