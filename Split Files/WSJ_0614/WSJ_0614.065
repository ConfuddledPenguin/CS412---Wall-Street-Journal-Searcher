   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Parliament told the government to
refine its controversial economic reform program by
September, but agreed to let President Mikhail Gorbachev
introduce many of its key provisions by decree over the
summer.
   The decision amounts to a face-saving compromise for Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who ran into a storm of criticism
last month over his plans to establish a more market-oriented
economy.

   Although the government will now have its work cut out to
make the measures more palatable to the general public, the
Supreme Soviet broadly endorsed the thrust of the program and
some of its major steps in a seven-point resolution.
   "The most important thing is that we can start work," said
a relieved Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime minister who
drafted most of the government's original proposals. They
include plans for selling off state assets to the public,
creating a Western-style banking system, breaking up
industrial monopolies and gradually freeing some prices from
government control. Many of the measures are to take effect
next year.
   Mr. Ryzhkov was sharply criticized from all sides last
month when he introduced his package, principally because it
emphasized steep price rises for basic foodstuffs and gave
only scant details of other measures. The price-rise
announcement triggered a round of panic buying by consumers,
and Mr. Ryzhkov's political future seemed highly uncertain.
   The Soviet premier now appears to have weathered the worst
of the storm, however, thanks to skillful political
maneuvering. Soviet officials say Mr. Ryzhkov's aides played
an important role in persuading parliamentary committees to
strike a conciliatory tone. They even had a big hand in
drafting the text of the resolution that the Parliament
adopted yesterday.
   Some changes have been made to the original Ryzhkov plans.
For one thing, the idea of holding a referendum on the
economic package has now been dropped. Instead, the
government and Parliament agree that there should be some
public discussion of the measures, but are leaving it to
local authorities to specify what form they should take.
   The government must also still win backing for its plans
to raise bread prices this summer. It initially proposed
tripling the price on July 1 in an effort to reduce wasteful
consumption and cut back on grain imports. Parliament is
considering whether to endorse the increase, but postponed a
decision until today. During the debate, several deputies
made emotional speeches about the need to keep down the price
of bread, which has remained unchanged for almost 30 years
under the Soviet system of state-set prices.
   The Kremlin is promising that any price increases will be
largely compensated by cash payments to the population from
the government budget. Although the price rises will be
mandatory, Parliament agreed to leave the exact decisions on
compensation to local authorities in the 15 constituent
republics.
   According to Mr. Abalkin, the government is obliged by a
parliamentary resolution adopted last year to gain approval
for any price rises taking effect this year. But beginning in
1991, the government will be able to push through price rises
without the support of lawmakers.
   While Mr. Ryzhkov and his aides fine tune their economic
proposals, Mr. Gorbachev could decide to take the initiative
and introduce many key measures over the summer. The
Parliament agreed to empower the Soviet president to
introduce new legislation by decree on such important issues
as denationalization of state property, establishing stock
ownership and breaking up industrial monopolies. His mandate
does not, however, extend to prices.
