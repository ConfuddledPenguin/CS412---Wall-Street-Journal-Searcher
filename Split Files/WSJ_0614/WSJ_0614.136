   A group including Tinicum Enterprises Inc. of Garden City,
N.Y., said it raised its stake in Kollmorgen Corp. to the
equivalent of 19.5%.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group
said it bought 707,100 shares in the open market from May 11
to June 12 for $10.50 to $11.80 each, or a total of $7.9
million.

   The group now controls 2,424,691 Kollmorgen common shares,
assuming the conversion of Series D preferred stock it holds.
   In March, Kollmorgen, a Simsbury, Conn., manufacturer of
motors and electro-optical systems, sold preferred stock
convertible into 11.9% of Kollmorgen on a fully diluted basis
to Tinicum. The sale was made during Vernitron Corp.'s
unsuccessful attempt to take control of Kollmorgen's board.
   Vernitron, a closely held Deer Park, N.Y., manufacturer of
motors and controls, recently reduced its stake in Kollmorgen
to 4.8%.
   Kollmorgen couldn't be reached for comment. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Kollmorgen's
shares were unchanged at $11.625.
