   Eastern Europe's doors to democracy opened so abruptly the
past year that there were doubts whether the countries would
know what to do with their new freedoms. Or whether, as the
bloody events in Romania yesterday remind us, stable
democratic governments could arise after 40 years of
totalitarian rule. With the first round of elections in the
post-Communist era just about complete, some initial
observations are possible.
   East Europeans turned out at the polls in proportions
larger than voters generally do in the West. Whether they
voted for a national consensus movement, as they did in
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, or for a dolled-up
version of the ruling party, as they did in Romania and
apparently did in Bulgaria, the electors were intent on
making a clear break with the past.

   Nevertheless, not one of these elections can be considered
as anything more than transitional. One reason is that
nowhere in Eastern Europe have political parties been able to
sufficiently organize to represent coherent ideologies and
identifiable constituencies. Nor could most parties field
nationally recognized candidates. Politicians with any record
in governance invariably were compromised by having been
members of the discredited Communist Party. This is
especially so in Romania and Bulgaria.
   There was an extraordinary outburst of violence in the
Romanian capital yesterday when the army fired upon
anti-Communist demonstrators in a melee at the state-run TV
station. There have been nonstop protests in Bucharest for
nearly three months, complaining that the National Salvation
Front, which got the most votes in a recent parliamentary
election, still is dominated by Communists.
   Fears exist of similar post-election violence in Bulgaria.
One of the main factors behind the Bulgarian Socialists'
victory was that the ad-hoc opposition coalition failed to
overcome the long-entrenched party machinery in the
countryside. They also had a strong strategy in being the
ones to initiate the reforms, and then calling early
elections. That the party had Moscow's evident support was no
liability in Bulgaria. Nor did it hurt that Bulgaria's brand
of communism was relatively less harsh in economic terms than
in neighboring countries such as Romania. So the opposition
may be only partially correct in ascribing the Socialist
victory to voter fear and election irregularities.
   But that's no cause for discouragement. Political
movements that have won electoral victories elsewhere in
Eastern Europe -- Solidarity in Poland, the Civic Forum in
Czechoslovakia and the Democratic Forum in Hungary -- are in
a similarly unsettled situation. Only East Germany, whose
prospects are directly linked to German unification, is an
exception. As political, economic and social questions become
clearer, so will the positions of the various parties and
candidates on these issues. Judging from the current
political battles in Poland, which led off Eastern Europe's
elections last year, no candidate will be able to take voters
for granted.
   It will not necessarily be a sign of failure if voters in
these countries are called back to the polls before the
mandates of their latest ballots expire. On the contrary. The
regimes that would cause the most worry would be the ones
that might be tempted, in the name of political stability, to
make their rule permanent.
