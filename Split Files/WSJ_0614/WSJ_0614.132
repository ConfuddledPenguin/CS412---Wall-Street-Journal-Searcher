   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Amgen Inc., whose stock price has
nearly doubled over the past 12 months, declared a 2-for-1
stock split and said it would redeem its convertible
debentures.
   The biotechnology company said the split would be
distributed Aug. 10 to stock of record July 31.

   Amgen will redeem its $50 million face amount of 8%
convertible debentures July 25 at a price of $5,386.67 for
each $5,000 face amount of debentures. The conversion rate is
96.8992 shares for each $5,000 principal amount, equal to a
price of $51.60 a share.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgen
shares rose $1.50 to $74 a share. The stock's large premium
over the conversion price makes it more attractive for debt
holders to convert their debentures into Amgen common than to
tender the debentures to the company.
   Assuming conversion of all of the debentures, Amgen said
it will have about 37.2 million shares outstanding after the
stock split. The conversion will save the company about $4
million in annual interest expense.
