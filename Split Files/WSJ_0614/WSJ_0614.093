   Getty Petroleum Corp., the independent gasoline marketer,
reported fiscal first-quarter net income sank 97%. The
company cited "extreme volatility affecting our cost of
product" and a "very competitive reselling market."
   In the quarter ended April 30, earnings dropped to
$196,000, or two cents a share, from $7.7 million, or 58
cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell 8.2%
to $251 million from $273.4 million.

   The Jericho, N.Y.-based company also said that results
reflected $1.1 million of additional expense from compliance
with environmental rules. Getty also reported a $2.1 million
gain from an accounting adjustment.
   Getty, formerly Power Test Corp., was formed by the
purchase of the Getty name, marketing assets and terminals
from Texaco Inc., when the White Plains, N.Y., oil giant
bought Getty Oil Co.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Getty Petroleum shares closed unchanged at $19.75.
