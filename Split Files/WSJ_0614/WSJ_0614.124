   Racal Electronics PLC said pretax profit for the year
ended March 31 rose 13% to #201 million ($342.4 million) from
#178 million a year earlier largely because of substantial
growth in its telecommunications sector.
   The company said profit after tax and minority interests
was little changed at #117 million.
