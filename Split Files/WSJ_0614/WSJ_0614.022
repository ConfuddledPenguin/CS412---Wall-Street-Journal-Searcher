   NEW YORK -- A surprisingly weak May retail sales report
caught the bond market off guard, igniting a rally that
pushed bond yields to the lowest levels since February.
   Prices of the benchmark 30-year bond rose nearly 7/8
point, or $8.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, eased to 8.38%. That was the lowest yield on a
benchmark bond since February 13.

   The bond market began to move immediately after the
government reported that retail sales fell 0.7% in May. The
government also said it revised downward April and March
retail sales. The drop in last month's retail-sales data
revived speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon loosen
its grip on credit to perk up a sluggish economy.
   Before the news on retail sales, "investors had pretty
much accepted the statements by Fed officials that the
central bank has no intention of easing policy in the
future," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at
Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. "Now, it's re-emerged
as a good possibility."
   Activity was also brisk in the junk-bond market, where a
strong rally in the bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. spread to the
entire junk bond market.
   The RJR rally was triggered by a story that appeared in
yesterday's Wall Street Journal, which said that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. plans to inject $1.7 billion into the
food and tobacco giant. RJR was taken private early last year
in a record $25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts. RJR is the single biggest issuer of junk bonds.
   "It has been an astounding day," said David Feinman, a
junk-bond trader at Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co. "This
is the way it used to be in terms of trading volume and
action."
   RJR Nabisco's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished 7 3/8 points higher to close at 90 3/4
on the New York Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind bonds, which are
extremely volatile, pay interest in the form of more
securities instead of cash.
   The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, gained 7 3/8 points
to close at 76 3/4.
   Trading volume in the exchangeable debentures was
extremely heavy, with more than $25 million face value of
bonds changing hands.
   Alan Schlesinger, manager of high-yield trading at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said the report
suggests that one of the problems -- the uncertainty over
whether RJR would be able to reset the bonds at a favorable
rate -- has disappeared.
   "When you remove some of the uncertainty from the
marketplace, it takes another obstacle to prevent it from
going up," said Mr. Schlesinger.
   The possible cash injection is designed to raise the price
of the two RJR bond issues so that they don't have to be
reset at prohibitively high interest rates. The coupon on the
two issues must be reset no later than April 28, 1991, so
that the bonds trade at par.
   The robust gains in the RJR issues rippled through the
junk bond market, sparking a rally and triggering gains of
3/4 point to 1 point.
   Dirk Van Doren, a high-yield analyst at McCarthy Crisanti
&amp; Maffei Inc., said although it had been rumored for some
time that KKR would buy back the RJR pay-in-kind bonds, it
wasn't clear where funds for the buy-back would come from.
   "Now it's not a question of funds, now it's a question of
whether KKR wants to pull the trigger" by buying back the
bonds or launching an exchange offer, said Mr. Van Doren. "In
my mind, KKR will wait."
   Mr. Van Doren said if the fundamentals of the company are
strong, then the bonds will automatically trade at prices
that would allow KKR to reset the rate at a favorable level.
   RJR pay-in-kind bonds were not the only gainers Wednesday.
RJR's zero-coupon bonds sprinted up 3 5/8 points to 47 5/8,
while RJR's 13.5% subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001,
advanced 1 1/2 points to 96.
   RJR's warrants, surprisingly, also rose. After climbing
one point initially, the warrants closed up 1/4 point at 7
1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds jumped yesterday after the Commerce
Department reported weaker-than-expected retail sales for
May.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a
price of 103 30/ 32 to yield 8.38% compared with 103 4/32 to
yield 8.45% on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 103
4/32 to yield 8.38% compared with 102 17/32 to yield 8.47%.
   Short-term rates moved moderately lower. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.67% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.91%. The rate on six-month bills
fell to 7.58% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.97%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A $710 million New York City general-obligation bond issue
dominated the tax-exempt arena, prompting good investor
response, especially from the retail sector, underwriters
reported.
   Meanwhile, municipal bonds traded up 1/8 to 1/4 point in
quiet secondary-market dealings.
   The New York City bonds, which included new money and
refunding bonds, were priced to yield from 6% in 1990 to
7.90% in 2018-2028.
   The bonds are rated single-A by Moody's Investors Service
Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., excluding
bonds due in 1998-2000, and 2013-2017, which are insured and
rated triple-A by both ratings services.
   Officials with the lead underwriter, Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, were meeting with city officials to determine
whether the deal would be repriced and couldn't be reached
for comment late yesterday.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were up 1/8 point at 98
5/8 to yield 7.31%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices ended around yesterday's
highs, having risen at the outset of trading as news of a
surprise drop in retail sales in May pumped up U.S.
Treasurys.
   Most discount issues posted gains of about 3/8 to 1/2
point, while premium issues were 1/8 to 3/8 firmer from late
Tuesday. Government National Mortgage Association 9.5%
securities gained 13/32 to 99 19/ 32, Ginnie Mae 10% issues
were up 11/32 at 101 31/32 and Ginnie Mae 12.5% securities
advanced 1/8 to 109 7/8.
   Traders say the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s
decision to revamp its mortgage-securities program,
shortening the payment delay between the time homeowners make
their monthly payment and the time investors receive payments
from Freddie Mac via its new Gold PC program, isn't affecting
prices of existing Freddie Mac securities.
   Freddie Mac 9.5% securities were 13/32 firmer at 98 29/32,
10% securities were 3/8 higher at 100 30/32 and 12%
securities were up 1/8 at 106 22/32.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Investment-grade bonds were also stronger yesterday, with
most intermediate-term issues rising 1/2 point.
   Bids for the bonds of Chrysler Corp. disappeared yesterday
after Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the auto maker's
senior debt under review for possible downgrade.
   Corporate bond traders said although Chrysler securities
didn't actually trade lower, bids for the bonds vanished as
soon as the story hit the newswires.
   Meanwhile, about $350 million in new debt was priced
yesterday including a fiveyear $250 million issue of
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. notes. The non-callable notes were
priced to yield 9.02%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, ended higher on
various factors, including a strong rise in U.S. Treasury
bonds.
   The U.K. market opened higher as sterling continued to
firm on expectations that Britain shortly will enter the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   When the U.S. bond market started to rise on news of a
weak retail sales report, gilts continued to gain strength.
   Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 was
up 29/32 at 102 to yield 11.45%.
