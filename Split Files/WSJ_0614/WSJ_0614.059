   NEW YORK -- Several of the nation's largest
public-television stations are laying off staff and reducing
programming expenditures in the wake of reduced funding from
the federal government, corporate underwriters and viewer
contributions.
   Among the stations affected by the crunch are WNET in New
York, WHYY in Philadelphia and KCTS in Seattle. All are
members of the Public Broadcasting Service, which receives
funds from the federally funded Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. PBS station officials said viewer donations are
flat and haven't kept pace with rising production costs, and
federal funding hasn't increased to keep up with inflation.

   The latest victim of the budget crunch is New York's WNET.
Yesterday, the station said that because of a shortage of
funding, it would reduce its 1990-91 budget, which begins
July 1, by 11.5% from $112.7 million to $99.7 million.
   As a result, about 10% of the station's 500-member staff
will be laid off, and two shows, the locally produced
public-affairs series, "The Eleventh Hour" and "Metro Week in
Review," will be canceled.
   "Revenues have not kept pace with rising costs," said
William F. Baker, WNET president. "These two shows were the
only ones we produced locally and the ones that were not
fully funded, or even close to being fully funded."
   While PBS is an umbrella organization that provides
programs for 337 public-TV stations nationwide, some
stations, such as WNET and WGBH in Boston, also produce a
number of shows for PBS members.
   WHYY, the Philadelphia PBS station, recently laid off
eight employees and isn't filling five other positions, says
Nessa Forman, the station's program director. Seattle's KCTS
reduced its staff by 10% when it eliminated 14 jobs and
reduced its annual budget by about 1% to $13.2 million.
   "We've had to redirect our budget to reflect the sluggish
economy," said Walter Parsons, senior vice president of
finance and administration at KCTS.
   Peter Downey, a senior vice president at Alexandria,
Va.-based PBS, said he doesn't think the financial woes at
the individual PBS stations "represent a trend."
   "This is a high-risk business," he said. "Stations that
have budgets approaching $100 million, like WNET and WGBH,
have to get a lot of money fast and from a lot of different
places. It's not easy."
   Henry Becton, president of Boston's WGBH, said the
station's $100 million budget, which rose 10% last year, will
be flat for its coming fiscal year, which begins in
September.
   WNET's Mr. Baker said WNET will air two new series in
September, but to save costs, the shows will be aired live
rather than on tape.
   "The Eleventh Hour," which premiered as a nightly show in
January 1989, had an annual operating budget of $6 million,
said Mr. Baker. WNET raised only $1 million from foundations.
The rest came from the station's discretionary funds. "And we
are a station without a lot of discretionary funds," he said.
The weekly "Metro Week in Review" had a budget of $375,000.
   The anchor for the "The Eleventh Hour," former CBS News
and NBC News correspondent Robert Lipsyte, said he was
"disappointed" by the show's demise. "We didn't get funding
from any large toxic waste manufacturers. And we didn't get
enough money from the station. I guess there aren't enough
tote baggers out there."
