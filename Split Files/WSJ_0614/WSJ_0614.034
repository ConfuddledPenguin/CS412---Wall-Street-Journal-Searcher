   New health research strengthens the argument that men who
control cholesterol levels in their blood can sharply reduce
their risk of death from heart disease, the nation's biggest
killer.
   The reduced risk was especially significant among men
participating in a recent study who had already had heart
attacks or other evidence of heart disease. Since half of the
500,000 U.S. residents who die from heart attacks each year
have a prior history of heart disease, effective reduction of
cholesterol among such people could sharply reduce
heart-disease deaths, the researchers said.

   "Although the importance of cholesterol has been pretty
well established," says Basil M. Rifkind, chief of Lipid
Metabolism and Atherogenisis at the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute, "there's always been some doubt about its
impact among those who have already had a heart attack."
   In a study published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, scientists found that men with a history of heart
disease with cholesterol levels above 240 milligrams per
deciliter of blood were nearly 3 1/2 times more likely to die
from heart disease than those with heart disease and
cholesterol levels under 200.
   By applying the study's results, the findings suggest that
if you're a male between 40 and 69 years old with cholesterol
below 200 and evidence of heart disease, your chance of dying
of heart disease in the next 10 years is about 4%. But if you
have heart disease, and your cholesterol is above 240, your
risk of death of the disease in 10 years soars to 20%.
   While other factors, including damage caused by a heart
attack, also contribute to risk of death, Dr. Rifkind says,
the difference in risk between those with high and desirable
cholesterol levels shows that the "contribution of
cholesterol to heart-attack risk was very substantial."
   Until recently, heart-attack patients with high
cholesterol weren't being treated for cholesterol, says Dr.
Rifkind, who is project officer for the study that is being
conducted by dozens of investigators in academic centers
around the world. "That's beginning to change, but there are
probably a lot of people out there that aren't being
appropriately treated."
   In this study, researchers followed 2,541 white men for 10
years after taking cholesterol readings and medical histories
in the early 1970s. Beginning in 1977, researchers tried to
check on each participant annually to determine whether they
were still living, and, if they had died, whether the cause
was related to heart disease.
   There was no attempt to determine whether the subjects
changed living habits or otherwise reduced their risk of
heart disease during the 10-year period. The cholesterol
levels were taken only at the beginning of the study.
   Among the subjects of the study, 17% had some evidence of
heart disease when the study began. As expected, prevalence
of heart disease among the subjects increased with age.
   Another 76%, or 1,940 people, didn't have a history of
heart problems. Among those subjects, cholesterol levels
above 240 indicated a 5% chance of dying of heart disease
within 10 years, while the risk fell to under 2% for those
with levels below 200. The remaining 7% of subjects were
unclassified as to heart disease. The researchers also found
similar trends when cholesterol counts were separated into
high density lipoprotein, or HDL, the so-called good
cholesterol, and its low density, or LDL counterpart. For
instance a high LDL cholesterol level was associated with a
17% risk of death in 10 years among men with heart disease,
while men with low HDL faced a 16% risk of death.
   The group being studied was culled from a broader group of
nearly 9,000 men and women. Since heart disease generally
affects women later in life than men, no statistically sound
conclusions have yet been reached regarding women and
cholesterol levels in this ongoing study, Dr. Rifkind says.
