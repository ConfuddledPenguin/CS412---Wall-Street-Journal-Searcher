   EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands -- Dutch manufacturer N.V.
Philips Gloeilampenfabriek and Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co. of Japan have agreed to form a joint venture to develop
the standard for the "domestic digital bus," or D2B, a device
that would make compatible audio and visual parts
manufactured under different specifications.
   For the D2B system to work, one of its integral parts is a
computer chip that must be designed to certain standards,
according to a Philips spokesman. The spokesman noted that at
this time only Philips and Matsushita are actively involved
in trying to set that standard.

   Philips will hold a 75% stake and Matsushita a 25% stake
in the venture, D2B Systems Co., which will be based in
London and be initially funded with #3 million ($5.1
million). The Philips spokesman said that the proportions of
the stakes in the joint venture don't necessarily reflect the
amount of work accomplished by either firm in developing the
D2B standard.
   Both Thomson S.A. of France and Sony Corp. of Japan,
neither of which are working on a D2B standard, have
recognized the need for a single standard and have agreed to
support the standard developed by Philips and Matsushita, the
Philips spokesman said.
