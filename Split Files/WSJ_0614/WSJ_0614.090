   NEW YORK -- The stock market is showing a sign of strength
that Wall Street has long awaited.
   Though it's hardly a mighty river sweeping stocks along,
the rally of the past six weeks is widening into more than a
squirt-gun blast. In Wall Street parlance, breadth is picking
up.

   More stocks are being carried higher, beyond the 30 Dow
Jones Industrial Average issues and the dependable growth
stocks that have been chugging their way upward since
January. In general, the greater the breadth of a rally, the
longer it lasts and the farther it goes. So Wall Street is
paying a lot of attention to breadth, seeking to determine
whether the rally will persist or turn out to be a flash in
the pan.
   And current market breadth, although much improved, still
lacks the sweeping dimensions that would convince skeptics
that a major bull move is in the offing.
   "It's decent breadth, but it's not investment stampede
breadth," says Robert Farrell, chief market analyst for
Merrill Lynch. To him, at least, the spring rally looks more
like the late stages of an old bull market than the early
stages of a new one.
   Wall Street measures breadth in three ways: what kinds of
stocks are advancing; how many stocks are climbing; and how
much trading volume is propelling the advance. Here's how
those factors stand:
                                                                                                       

   Small stocks join in. After lagging for a long time,
smaller and more speculative stocks have joined the party. To
some extent, they have even led the revelry.
   Since the market rally began April 27, the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks has risen 12.2%.
The small-stock contingent thus managed to beat the
behemoths, including the Dow Jones industrials, which gained
10.8% for that period, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index, ahead 10.9%.
   "Really, the Nasdaq led the Dow up," says Alfred Goldman,
chief technical analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.
In the short run, he thinks that's a bullish sign. But in the
longer term, he says, leadership by smaller stocks is often a
sign of a "speculative fever" that heralds the end of a long
upturn.
                                                                                                       

   Advances vs. declines. One of the major tools of the
market technician is the advance-decline line. The line shows
the total number of daily advancing stocks minus the total
number of decliners, cumulatively since the analyst's chosen
starting date.
   Unlike the leading market indexes, the advance-decline
line varies depending on the starting point. Market
technicians can start their count from any date they wish.
Thus, a dozen technicians may quote a dozen different sets of
advance-decline numbers. However, their advance-decline
charts should show a strong family resemblance to one
another.
   Since April 27, advancers are outnumbering decliners by a
total of 5,190 issues on the Big Board. The margin is
narrower, around 3,600, for Nasdaq issues and a still
narrower 425 on the American Stock Exchange, which lists
fewer stocks.
   That's nice as far as it goes. But the recent rally has
undone only about half the damage to the advance-decline line
that had occurred since the start of this year. The Big
Board's advance-decline line for all of 1990, for example, is
still at about a negative 4,215.
   "Breadth peaked in August of last year, as measured by the
advance-decline line," says Philip Roth, technical analyst
for Dean Witter Reynolds. But he says he's not especially
worried by that fact.
   "You can go on for a considerable time with these
divergences" between a recordsetting Dow and lukewarm
breadth, he says. For example, in 1971-73, such a divergence
lasted for 20 months. However, a severe bear market followed
in 1973-74.
   Mr. Roth says he hopes the divergence will resolve itself
this time by the broad market picking up more steam. That
happened in 1963-64, he says.
   Besides the advance-decline line, market pros keep their
eyes on some other gauges. Byron Wien, chief strategist at
Morgan Stanley, says it is "unique" that only about 40% of
stocks are trading above their 200-day moving averages, yet
the Dow industrials are near record highs. Merrill's Mr.
Farrell says surprisingly few stocks are hitting 52-week
highs, which he says is grounds for caution.
                                                                                                       

   Volume. The market's spring upswing has been achieved on
puny volume in timid trading. On Tuesday, for example, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average muscled its way up 40.85 points,
but volume was a moderate 157.1 million shares. By contrast,
volume was running at about 192 million shares a day at the
peak of the 1987 bull market.
   Mr. Farrell says he would like to see volume of more than
180 million shares daily for a sustained period to give him
more confidence that the current advance will last.
   Mr. Roth, though, says the poor volume doesn't scare him.
"I heard that as a bearish argument in 1988 and 1989," he
says, "and the market rose 50%. Stocks can rise forever if
there's no selling. The reverse is also true. Stocks can fall
forever on light volume."
   Putting together the various pieces of the puzzle, many
market technicians don't see further big gains as likely,
though they generally do expect the 3000 level on the Dow
Jones industrials to be pierced. The industrial average
closed yesterday at 2929.95, down 3.47.
   To persuade him that this rally is going to be major and
lasting, Mr. Farrell says he would want to see several days
running in which gainers outnumber losers by a 3-1 margin or
better and volume exceeds 180 million shares. June 4 was the
only day recently with that kind of number. Yesterday, for
example, volume was 158.9 million shares, and losers ran a
little ahead of gainers.
   Mr. Goldman of A.G. Edwards says: "Breadth has improved,
but it's far from fabulous. . . . It's certainly not what you
see when the market is in a strong bull trend." He says the
market is entering a new back-and-forth trading range,
perhaps between 2750 and 3000.
   Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley says recent improvements in
market breadth have encouraged him to put some money into
smaller and more speculative stocks than he had been
choosing. He says the Dow Jones industrials will cross 3000
and quite possibly keep rising after that. But he would start
to sell if the index gets much above 3000. With corporate
earnings lackluster and interest rates unlikely to fall much
from current levels, he says, "This is not the start of
something big."
