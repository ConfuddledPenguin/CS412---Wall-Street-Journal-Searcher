   PROSPECT HEIGHTS, Ill. -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., citing
the "continued rapid growth" of Household International
Inc.'s "relatively weaker subsidiaries," lowered its ratings
on the approximately $9 billion in debt of the company's main
finance unit, Household Finance Corp.
   The rating concern said Household Finance is being
burdened by supporting the growth of "these weaker
operations," such as Household Bank, and the British
subsidiary HFC Bank PLC. Household Finance also has
"experienced diminished profitability, reduced loss-reserve
coverage and somewhat aggressive debt leverage," S&amp;P said.
Household International and Household Finance have an
agreement with thrift regulators to maintain 6% regulatory
capital at Household Bank, and "the downgrade at the bank
reflects the rating adjustment at Household Finance Corp.,"
S&amp;P said.

   S&amp;P reduced its ratings on Household Finance's senior debt
to single-A-plus from double-A-minus; subordinated debt to
single-A from single-A-plus; preferred stock to single-A from
single-A-plus, and commercial paper to single-A-1 from
single-A-1-plus.
   Ratings on Household Bank's certificates of deposit were
lowered to what it listed as "single-A/A-" from
"single-A-plus/A-1," which wasn't explained and S&amp;P officials
weren't available to elaborate, and the Household Financial
Corp. unit's senior unsecured debt to single-A-plus from
double-A-minus.
   S&amp;P affirmed its ratings on Household International, the
parent company, one of the nation's biggest consumer finance
concerns.
   Household International said in a prepared statement that
it is disappointed with the ratings downgrades for its units.
"S&amp;P questioned the growth of Household Bank, which we view
as a strategic investment for future profitability," the
company said. It also disputed S&amp;P's statements that
profitability has diminished at Household Finance.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Household International shares closed at $52.625, up 25
cents.

   STANDARD &amp; POOR'S Corp. lowered its rating on certificates
of deposit of Household International Inc.'s Household Bank
unit to single-A/A-1 from single-A-plus/A-1. The new rating
was misstated in yesterday's edition.
