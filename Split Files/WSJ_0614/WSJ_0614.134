   SCEcorp, Rosemead, Calif., said that the Justice
Department won't oppose the proposed merger of the holding
company and its Southern California Edison Co. utility unit
with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.
   The merger was approved by SCEcorp and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric shareholders in April 1989; it is awaiting approvals
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the
California Public Utilities Commission.

   The Justice Department, a government agency that reviews
antitrust matters, has agreed on conditions that it says
"adequately resolve any concerns" about the impact of the
proposed merger on competition, SCEcorp said.
   Under the agreement, the combined company would extend
commitments to make transmission capacity in certain areas
available to other utilities. SCEcorp and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric also agreed they wouldn't enter into any power
purchase contracts with affiliated energy producers without
prior approval of the California commission.
