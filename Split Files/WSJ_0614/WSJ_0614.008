   Your beer is warm, your hot dog's cold,
   A post your view impairs.
   Cheer up] Where else could you be close
   To eighteen millionaires?
   -- Dick Emmons.

   Blank Verse
                                                                                                       

   Invisible ink has many uses,
   There's certainly little doubt of it;
   But its major drawback is
   How to know when you run out of it.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
