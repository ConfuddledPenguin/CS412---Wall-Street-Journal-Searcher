   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said it will spend
$17.7 million to improve its assembly plants in Newark, Del.,
and Sterling Heights, Mich.
   The plant improvements, scheduled to begin in early July,
are intended to improve car quality and customer
satisfaction. One improvement, called the "hot car concept,"
will supply electrical power to the cars as they move through
the assembly process, allowing operators to verify
performance of electrical parts and circuitry at the time of
installation.
