   RTC Has Swollen Real Estate Inventory
   From Sick S&amp;Ls Despite Recent Big Sales

   WASHINGTON -- The government's storehouse for sick
savings-and-loans sold 13,200 foreclosed S&amp;L properties since
August, but the agency still reported a swelling real estate
inventory.
   Despite those sales, the total inventory held by the
Resolution Trust Corp. increased 14% to 35,908 properties,
valued at $14.92 billion at the time they were seized, most
of them in Texas and the Southwest.

   While Texas, with 19,067 properties, still represents by
far the single largest cluster of foreclosed real estate,
several Midwestern and North Central states also showed big
increases. RTC holdings in Iowa, for example, jumped to 98
properties as of March, from 19 in September. Similarly, the
government now holds 74 properties in North Dakota, compared
with none in September, and Arizona's foreclosed property
more than doubled to 1,931 from 863.
   The trend of increased foreclosures across the U.S. will
accelerate in future reports, the RTC predicted. "Later
inventories will show a much broader spread of properties
around the country," warned William Seidman, chairman of the
RTC, established in August to sell sick S&amp;Ls and their
investments, including real estate.
   The latest inventory, which the agency is marketing
through a growing array of tools such as computer disks and
dial-up phone services, represents foreclosed properties as
of March 31. The previous inventory, the first ever, was
issued in January, and included about 30,000 properties
seized by this past September.
   As in the first list, the inventory consists mostly of
residences, with 29,977 houses, condos and mobile homes in
the inventory. And of these, 26,900 are on the market for
less than $100,000.
   But the list also includes everything from a $15,000 pool
hall in Houston, two uranium mines, to the Banning-Lewis
Ranch, a 24,000-acre expanse in Colorado Springs, Colo., that
has seen $250 million of development already.
   The value of all the property currently held by the RTC
was carried on the S&amp;Ls' books at about $14 billion, but will
probably be sold at prices 30% to 40% lower, Mr. Seidman
guesses. The new list excludes 13,200 properties sold, which
had a book value of $1.6 billion; prices of these properties
were unavailable.
   Real estate currently represents about 13% of the RTC's
$173 billion in assets. But the RTC expects that to grow, as
more S&amp;L loans sour that have real estate as collateral.
Other assets, including cash, securities, and performing
loans can be sold much more easily by the agency.
   Because the RTC only recently became more flexible about
pricing, the inventory doesn't reflect changes in asking
price for the real estate the agency still carries. About
one-third of the properties listed in the inventory aren't
priced, because they haven't been appraised.
   The RTC says purchasing interest comes from a variety of
places. Colorado, for example, has made inquiries about
acquiring some of the RTC's 105 mobile homes in that state,
to shelter dozens of people who lost their homes in a recent
tornado. And a special phone line (1-800-782-3006) that
enables callers to find out about specific problems in
particular areas is receiving an average of 2,000 calls a
day.
   The RTC used the occasion of updating its inventory to
launch a new marketing effort. The agency will open 14 sales
centers across the U.S., where buyers can discuss RTC
property in any region. The RTC also made available its lists
on compact laser disks and computer floppy disks. It plans to
hold satellite-linked auctions every four months, and says it
has received interest on possible sales of $500 million
chunks of property.
   "This is the start of our ability to become a true
marketing organization," says Mr. Seidman.
