   Petroleum Investments Ltd., Oklahoma City, said it plans
to consolidate its oil and gas partnerships with a recently
formed affiliate, Bradmar Petroleum Corp. The company said
Bradmar will offer to exchange one share of its common stock
for every 10 units of the partnerships and for every five
dollars of exchange value of the partnerships' interests in
the programs. Bradmar is also offering 16,935 shares for the
general partner's interest in the limited partnerships.
   The exchange offer, which expires July 13, is subject to
the receipt of about 8.4 million of the 16.8 million
outstanding units.

   Petroleum Investments said it has decided not to make a
quarterly distribution during the offering period; therefore,
no distributions will be made in the second quarter. The
partnership last paid a distribution of two cents on
September 29, 1989.
