   A number of Donald Trump's 54 creditors are balking at
joining four New York banks' plan to restructure the Trump
empire, according to banking and real estate executives
familiar with the negotiations.
   One of the bankers involved in the discussions said the
chances that the New Jersey, European and Asian creditors
would agree to the complex plan are "only about 50-50."

   Should the creditors not agree by tomorrow, when Mr. Trump
has a scheduled payment on his Trump's Castle casino bonds,
the restructuring of $2 billion of bank debt could be
imperiled. Participants in the negotiations said it was still
possible Mr. Trump could get an extension to pay bondholders.
   Some of the smaller creditors believe that their loans are
better secured than those of some of the major creditors.
Under the terms of the proposal, the creditors would be paid
off in proportion to the amount they've lent, not in relation
to how much collateral is behind their loans.
   One banker described yesterday's negotiations as
"extremely fluid," with some parties reversing their
positions many times during the discussions.
   Until late in the day it appeared that New Jersey banks,
with as much as $140 million in loans to Mr. Trump, wouldn't
sign off on the agreement. However, by the end of the day,
the banks, which include First Fidelity Bancorp and Midlantic
Banks Inc., were said to be tentatively supportive of the
plan.
   First Fidelity is said to have lent Mr. Trump at least $75
million toward his purchase of the Taj Mahal casino in
Atlantic City. Midlantic has lent Mr. Trump at least $65
million for capital improvements and to finance the purchase
of Trump's Castle bonds in the open market.
   Under the agreement worked out between Mr. Trump and his
four major New York creditors, Mr. Trump would get $60
million in cash and a suspension in his interest payments to
the banks in exchange for forfeiting equity in many of his
properties.
   The plan came about after the high-profile real estate and
casino mogul acknowledged to his bankers that his cash flow
in the coming year wouldn't likely be enough to pay his
debts.
   Under the proposal, if Mr. Trump sells a casino, after the
bondholders are paid off the banks would share half the
proceeds of the first $100 million of the sale with Mr.
Trump, according to an individual who has seen the term
sheet. Such a split could cut into the New Jersey banks'
share of the deal, since a portion of their loans are on a
par with the bondholders' securities.
   The New Jersey banks declined comment, as did Mr. Trump.
The four major creditors, Bankers Trust of New York Corp.,
Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., also declined comment.
   If the restructuring proposal is approved, the creditors
are expected to require Mr. Trump to set up a more
traditional corporate structure that would keep close tabs on
the company's finances.
   People close to the talks said Trump officials have
already interviewed various candidates for the position of
chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. One
individual who has been interviewed is Frederick Zuckerman,
treasurer of the Chrysler Corp., who has said he would be
leaving the auto maker, according to people familiar with the
situation. Other applicants also are being considered,
according to a person close to Mr. Trump. Mr. Zuckerman
declined to comment on his plans.
