   JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
that "to a great extent" the U.S. bears the blame for the
increasingly warlike rhetoric emanating from Arab nations.
   Mr. Shamir predicted further deterioration in regional
stability unless the U.S. acted quickly to end "the
perception in the Arab world" that relations between Israel
and the U.S. are fraying. In Washington, however, Secretary
of State James Baker criticized the new Israeli government in
unusually harsh terms.

   According to Mr. Shamir, "When Arabs see that there is a
close link between the U.S. and Israel, the conclusion is
that they have to give up the idea of defeating Israel by
force." But "when this perception changes and hopes arise
that there could be a wedge driven between the U.S. and
Israel, dreams of defeating Israel militarily arise again.
This is the rule."
   To the extent that Arab states moderated toward Israel in
the 1980s, he said, it was "thanks to very close relations
between the U.S. and Israel" under President Reagan.
   Reacting to news reports about negative comments by Mr.
Shamir and others in the new cabinet on his peace plan,
Secretary of State Baker said: "If that's going to be the
approach, and that's going to be the attitude, there won't be
any dialogue and there won't be any peace."
   Mr. Baker, who was testifying before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, provided the phone number of the White
House for Israeli listeners. "Everybody over there should
know that the telephone number is 1-202-456-1414," he said.
"When you're serious about peace, call us."
   In his first interview with a U.S. newspaper since the
installation of his new government Monday, Mr. Shamir seemed
to send a dual message: that he wants U.S. help to restart
the peace process but that he isn't willing to compromise his
hard-line views to get it.
   While Arab states excoriated the U.S. for support of
Israel at their summit in Baghdad last month, Israeli
officials make the opposite complaint. Aides say Mr. Shamir
hasn't had a phone conversation with Mr. Bush since March.
The U.S. president is said to be annoyed by Mr. Shamir's
intransigence last year when he continually added conditions
after launching a peace proposal calling for Palestinian
elections, stymying even preliminary talks on the idea.
   Israeli officials close to Mr. Shamir criticize Mr. Bush
for what one calls appeasement of such hard-line Arab leaders
as Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Others express astonishment that
Mr. Bush sat by while Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said
in Washington that he might block the emigration of Soviet
Jews if the Israeli government settled them in occupied
territories.
   Mr. Shamir didn't attack Mr. Bush, saying that "it isn't
my job to evaluate or criticize" him. "We want to maintain
the best relations we can," he said, but added that there are
"some differences and misunderstandings" to be overcome.
   Arabs have reacted angrily to Mr. Shamir's new government.
The Palestine Liberation Organization branded it "the worst
in Israel's history." A Jordanian newspaper, Al Dustour,
predicted "war and instability," while an Egyptian daily, Al
Akbar, called it "a government controlled by hawks, shedders
of blood and the maddest extremists."
   The 74-year-old prime minister seemed relaxed and even
jovial after the tough, three-month power struggle that
followed the toppling of his national unity coalition in the
state's first successful no-confidence motion. The Labor
Party called the motion over Mr. Shamir's refusal to accept
Mr. Baker's plan for preliminary talks with Palestinians.
   Although Mr. Shamir said he's ready for such talks, his
conditions make the prospect seem distant. While saying that
"almost all the world's conflicts came to an end by
negotiations between former enemies," he said he can't
envision ever sitting down with the PLO, or even with Faisal
Husseini, the East Jerusalem Palestinian leader who meets
regularly with Israeli peace groups and promotes nonviolent
protest tactics.
   Mr. Husseini is "the same" as PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat,
Mr. Shamir said. "In some cases, he's more extreme than
Arafat. Although he can express other views, this is the real
content" of his beliefs, he maintained.
   Mr. Shamir said he will talk with Palestinians who "accept
certain common ground with us," such as the Camp David
accords, which call for five years of Palestinian autonomy
with talks on the final status of the occupied lands
beginning during that time. But he said he also wants the
U.S. to focus on bringing neighboring Arab states into
negotiations. "If the U.S. decided to help us to implement
this plan, then activity of the U.S. hasn't only to be
concentrated on talks with Palestinians: There has to be
effort also with Arab countries." But he stressed that this
was "a desire" and not a precondition for a Palestinian
dialogue.
   "I don't think there's a reason to be frustrated," he
said, referring to U.S. concern over the lack of progress so
far. "It needs time," he said, adding that there are
procedural difficulties to overcome. "For the parties
involved, {these procedural issues} are not foolish matters."
   Mr. Shamir refused to spell out his intentions regarding
further Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The
U.S. has said such settlements are an obstacle to peace, and
the recent mass immigration of Soviet Jews has raised Arab
anxiety about their expansion.
   Ariel Sharon, the new housing minister, is an ardent
supporter of further settlements, as are many of the small
parties included in Mr. Shamir's coalition. "I'm not
committing myself to anything about creating new settlements
or not," Mr. Shamir said. "In my view, it isn't an important
matter. I don't think a few new settlements or new settlers
could have an impact" on peace negotiations.
