   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union broke the deadlock over
Lithuania yesterday by agreeing to ease its economic embargo
and resume shipping 15% of Lithuania's natural gas needs.
   "We are beginning to move toward a solution," Soviet
Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov told reporters during a series of
discussions between Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene and Kremlin officials. The Reuters news agency
quoted him as saying, "People are starting to understand that
by choosing that path they went into a dead end." He added in
reference to Lithuania's March 11 declaration of full,
immediate independence, "Now, it appears to me they
understand."

   In response to that declaration, President Mikhail
Gorbachev imposed sweeping economic sanctions and said he
wouldn't meet with Lithuanian leaders until they suspended or
rescinded their declaration of secession.
   However, he changed his stance. Mr. Gorbachev met with the
presidents of the three Baltic republics Tuesday and told
them that negotiations on a changed status can begin if the
republics simply freeze their independence declarations for
the duration of the talks. Estonia and Latvia have been
pursuing independence more cautiously than Lithuania.
   Mr. Gorbachev's backing away from confrontation over
regional independence was an attempt to retain the political
initiative in the face of bold moves by his rival Boris
Yeltsin.
   Mr. Gorbachev proposed to leaders of the nation's 15
republics that the Soviet Union be reconstructed as a kind of
loose federation with Moscow retaining undisputed control
only in key areas of national concern, such as defense and
foreign affairs.
   A committee to design the federation could be formed
within a week, according to Mr. Gorbachev's press secretary
Arkady Maslennikov.
   "It's the first time I've heard that formula, not as
bigger and smaller, but as equal partners," said Latvian
President Anatolijs Gorbunovs.
   Mr. Gorbachev's advisers and supporters say these moves
are signs of his sincere desire to resolve the thorny issue
of republics' desires for independence. But they also
indicate his recognition that events are moving with or
without his participation.
   Mr. Yeltsin has intensified that pressure. Elected
president of the Parliament of the Soviet Union's largest
republic, Russia, two weeks ago, Mr. Yeltsin has already
started bilateral talks with the leaders of other republics.
His own Parliament Tuesday overwhelmingly passed a
declaration of sovereignty, saying Russia's laws would be
supreme in its territory.
   "There is an absolutely new strong political force in the
Soviet Union, and that is a democratic Russia," said Igor
Gryazin, a Soviet Parliament member from Estonia. "Gorbachev
must decide whether to solve {problems} by himself or they
will be solved without his assistance through mutual
negotiations between Lithuania and Russia, Latvia and Russia,
and Estonia and Russia."
   At the same time, Mr. Yeltsin has been sounding more
moderate since his election. He told the Russian Parliament
yesterday that members must not be wary of entering a new
type of confederation and that he and Mr. Gorbachev will work
together on a friendly basis. "I think Mikhail Sergeyevich
took the first serious step and the next will be a discussion
of questions on all topics," Mr. Yeltsin said.
   The drive to improve economic conditions is the strongest
engine behind these initial attempts at horizontal ties. The
central government, which itself is attempting to reform the
nation's economy as a further stage in perestroika, supports
such contacts in theory as a logical part of the creation of
a market economy.
   In Washington, the White House welcomed the partial
lifting of the embargo against Lithuania. The Bush
administration sees the apparent easing of the Lithuanian
crisis as a vindication of its policy on the Baltic states,
which has avoided any sanctions against Moscow while quietly
pressing both sides for a dialogue. Members of Congress have
indicated they will not approve the trade pact signed by
Presidents Bush and Gorbachev during the Washington summit
until the embargo against Lithuania is lifted.
   According to a Lithuanian spokeswoman there were no
promsies about further relaxation of the embargo, but the
Soviet news agency Tass quoted Mrs. Prunskiene as saying
after meeting with Mr. Ryzhkov that, "We have no doubts the
economic blockade will be lifted."
   Mr. Ryzhkov said negotiations could lead to full
independent statehood for Lithuania, such as that enjoyed by
Finland, Mrs. Prunskiene was quoted as saying by a Lithuanian
spokeswoman contacted by the Associated Press. Mr. Ryzhkov
suggested that negotiations on independence would take two to
three years, the spokeswoman said.
