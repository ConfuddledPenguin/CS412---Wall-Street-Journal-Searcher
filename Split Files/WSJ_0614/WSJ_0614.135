   Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB confirmed that it has
withdrawn from a planned joint takeover with Finland's
Kymmene Oy of French forest products group Chapelle Darblay
S.A.
   Stora, the large Swedish pulp and paper concern, said its
pending 4 billion mark ($2.4 million) acquisition of West
Germany's Feldmuehle Nobel AG would have posed potential
antitrust difficulties in both France and West Germany for
the purchase of a 50% stake in Chapelle Darblay. Stora denied
that it pulled out under pressure from the French government
or at the request of West German antitrust authorities.

   The French Economics Ministry approved the sale of
Chapelle Darblay to Kymmene alone. Officials said Stora had
informed Kymmene and French authorities as early as mid-May
they wouldn't proceed with the purchase.
   Officials said Kymmene exercised a clause in the accord
giving them the right of first refusal to Stora's stake.
   The purchase price for Chapelle Darblay was 1.32 billion
French francs ($231.2 million).
