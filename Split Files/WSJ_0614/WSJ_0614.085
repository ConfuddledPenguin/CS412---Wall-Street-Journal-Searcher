   TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd. said it will make and sell
microprocessors based on an advanced design by
Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif.
   The deal gives Hitachi, a major supplier of
semiconductors, a leg up in the competition to supply a new
class of microprocessors called reduced instruction set
computing, or Risc, chips. These microprocessors, which form
the heart of computers or control devices, are generally more
powerful than traditional microprocessors.

   Hewlett-Packard said last year it would try to market its
Risc chips, which are used only in the company's own
computers. Last July, Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi agreed to
develop jointly a high-speed Risc chip.
   "This is a big boost for H-P," Andrew Allison, an
independent computer analyst, said of Hitachi's announcement.
"It puts the world on notice that H-P is serious" about
broadening the use of its Risc chips. By doing so,
Hewlett-Packard can encourage more easily software outsiders
to develop software for its Risc chip, which in turn will
benefit sales of its computers.
   The arrangement should help Hitachi compete better against
Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc., U.S. firms that also are
seeking to supply Risc chips, Mr. Allison said.
