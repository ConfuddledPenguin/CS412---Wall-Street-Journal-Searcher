   LONG POND, Pa. -- The speedsters roar past the grandstand,
leaving behind them the heavy smell of melted rubber and hot
oil. On the backstretch, the car in third place uses the
windbreak created by the two leaders to position itself to
surge into first and steal the checkered flag.
   It is just the sort of breathtaking finish to bring a roar
from the crowd. Except there is no crowd -- unless you
consider the masses at the exits of the Poconos International
Raceway after the day's other races. But, then, these drivers
are used to empty bleachers. They race Pintos.

   That's right, the ant-like subcompact pulled off the
market a decade ago amid a hubbub over the car's propensity
to burst into flames when hit in the rear. For Ford Motor
Co., the Pinto was easily its worst failure since the Edsel.
But the car has won a small but die-hard group of fans:
racing enthusiasts with big dreams and little budgets.
   Fifty dollars gets a Pinto from a junkyard. You might have
to haul it home on the back of a flatbed truck, but if you
assemble enough of the junkers you can put together a
racecar. And, best of all, there is no shortage of rusty
heaps from which to choose; Ford built more than a million
before taking the car off the market. "Every junkyard has
100," David Bowers, one of the first to race Pintos, says
happily.
   Installing the required safety equipment and souping up
the engine requires a bit more of an investment, but you can
put a Pinto on the track for less than $5,000, its fans say.
In contrast, racing a Porsche or a Corvette can cost more
than $90,000. And the Pinto isn't exactly the turtle of the
track, either. Some of the top racers have hit speeds of over
120 miles per hour -- pretty respectable for a car designed
to putter around for pennies per mile.
   "This is the most bang for your buck," says Michael
Goldsmith, a 33-year-old television cameraman from Hampstead,
Md., who races a screaming yellow Pinto. Among this sparse
crowd -- there are only 18 Pinto racers -- Mr. Goldsmith is
considered a big spender: He put some $8,000 into his Pinto,
splurging on the paint job and a sophisticated braking
system.
   As Mr. Goldsmith and his fellow drivers see it, Pinto
racing is something that Ford should be proud of, and perhaps
even exploit. After all, the company typically views racing
of its other models as a great marketing opportunity. Ford,
like the other big auto makers, spends millions (it won't say
just how much) to sponsor various forms of the sport.
   "This is the opportunity for them to prove that the Pinto
wasn't as bad as it was made out to be," Mr. Goldsmith says.
"We could take this show on the road and say, `Here's a Pinto
10 years later, and it's still going strong.'"
   But durability wasn't exactly the issue. Introduced in
1970 and pulled from the market a decade later, the car was a
costly debacle -- and a public-relations nightmare -- for
Ford. Critics asserted that the car's gasoline tank was
poorly positioned and, as a result, tended to puncture in
rear-end collisions, causing the car to explode.
   In 1980, an Indiana county prosecutor put Ford on trial on
charges of reckless homicide; Ford was accused of
deliberately taking safety shortcuts in designing the car and
thus causing the death of three teen-agers in a fiery
accident. Ford was acquitted in that case, but it has spent
years fighting a deluge of product-liability lawsuits. The
company is still spending money on the car, mostly for legal
fees.
   So, rather understandably, the charm of the car's
resurrection is lost on the company. "Oh, God]" groans Paul
Preuss, Ford's chief motor-sports spokesman. "I can't believe
somebody is racing Pintos in this day and age."
   Ford has made it quite clear it doesn't want anything to
do with this odd pack. The Pinto racers informally approached
the company about sponsorship several years ago, but gave up
when they got a chilly reception. Other commercial backers
are similarly tough to find. Racing Pintos are just as
colorfully festooned as the other cars on the track -- but
not with sponsors' decals. Some drivers tout pet causes.
"Save the Whales," "Plant a Tree" one car blares.
   Of course, the racing Pinto doesn't much resemble the ones
consumers drove out of showrooms in the 1970s. These cars are
specially modified to meet racing authorities' safety
requirements. Rules require all cars to be equipped with
special steel-and-plastic gas tanks that are virtually
impossible to puncture. Racers also must install internal
fire extinguishers and a roll cage that encases the entire
driver's compartment.
   The Pinto was born again during a late-night drinking
session at David Bowers's home in Alexandria, Va., in 1980.
Mr. Bowers, who works as a budget analyst for the Department
of Defense, is a self-described weekend racing junkie. But,
back then, he was getting increasingly frustrated with the
sport's spiraling costs.
   "You couldn't race competitively for under $20,000," he
says. With a similarly distressed group of racers, he hatched
the idea of racing the Pinto. After a few years of lobbying,
the Sports Car Club of America, which oversees amateur motor
racing, officially recognized the Pinto group as a distinct
racing class.
   The Pinto isn't as odd a candidate for the track as most
would think. Beneath its sheet metal beats the heart of true
racing machine. It has the frame and suspension of a sports
car, the Mustang II. And its 2.3-liter German-made engine is
durable, which makes engine failures less common and holds
down the cost of racing. Enlarge the camshaft, grind down the
cylinder heads, add a high-performance carburetor and you
transform a once-tame econo-box into a speed demon -- of
sorts.
   But racing this car takes more than a good mechanic and
quick reflexes. A sturdy ego is also helpful. Pinto drivers
endure a lot of snubs and sneers. Last year, at Watkins Glen
International Speedway in upstate New York, some Porsche and
BMW drivers objected to racing against Pintos. They feared
the slower cars would clog up the track, endangering other
drivers.
   The Porsche and BMW men dropped their objections after a
hasty -- and, for the Pinto men, humbling -- meeting. The
Pinto drivers managed to convince their foes "they know how
to get out of the way," says Gus Rosenberg, one of the
Porsche drivers.
   "Racing Pintos builds character," says Paul Moorcones, a
tire-store owner from Silver Spring, Md., and a long-time
racer. Once, at a cocktail party, a woman asked him what kind
of car he races. Pintos, he said. That was the end of that
conversation.
   Donald Caldwell, a racing comrade of Mr. Moorcones, agrees
that it takes a special person to race a Pinto -- and he
isn't one of them. Mr. Caldwell's 1983 Toyota Supra would eat
Pinto dust in a race, but the racer nonetheless says he
wouldn't consider driving the faster car. "I just can't see
myself in a Pinto," he says. "I think they are ugly little
cars."
   Being regarded as the pariahs of the racetrack may explain
why the Pinto racers are so closely knit. They help work on
each other's cars, and share parts and tools. Don Coronel,
who won the race at the Poconos Racetrack, won on an engine
given him by a competitor; Mr. Coronel blew out his engine
last year during a qualifying race.
   The Pinto racing crowd is admittedly less pretentious and
more quirky. Bruce Shelton, a 59-year-old cop from
Winchester, Va., says he took up racing years ago while in
the Air Force. One of his early victories: the Spanish
national go-cart championship in 1965.
   Mr. Coronel also caught the racing bug early. A short,
portly electrical engineer, he had childhood dreams of racing
at Indianapolis, but had to settle for a cheaper substitute.
He has an excellent track record in his Pinto. Of the three
races this year, he came in first in every one, including the
one in the Poconos.
   His daredevil style may account for his winning streak.
Intimidation might also. On the tail of his white Pinto, Mr.
Coronel has painted two skulls and crossbones. Between them
is his car's name: "The Terminator."
