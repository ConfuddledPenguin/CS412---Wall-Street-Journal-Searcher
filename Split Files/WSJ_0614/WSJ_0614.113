   PHILADELPHIA -- CoreStates Financial Corp. is expected to
introduce today a new generation of automated teller machines
designed to cash most checks instantly.
   Demand for such equipment is likely to grow because banks
are under pressure to clear checks faster. New federal
regulations that take effect in September will require banks
to credit to the customer's account within two days virtually
any check deposited through an ATM, and many banks have
indicated that they would have to eliminate ATM deposits
because they wouldn't be able to meet that speed. Current law
requires credit within seven days.

   CoreStates' new MAC Check machines, scheduled for a
demonstration today to industry executives attending a
banking conference at the University of Pennsylvania, are
equipped with more microchips for increased scanning
capability. They can read the blocky numbers printed with
magnetic ink in the lower left corner of each check. Unlike
older-generation machines, the new ones can identify the
check's originating bank, the account number and check number
before spitting out the cash.
   The new machines allow users to cash instantly all or part
of a check, depositing any remainder. ATM users also would be
able to buy certificates of deposit and verify their account
activity. Separate versions of the equipment are made by
International Business Machines Corp. and NCR Corp. The units
cost about $43,000 each.
   To get started in the program, customers pre-register
their payroll, government or dividend checks with human
tellers, who can instruct the ATM network to cash up to 10%
to 15% more than the typical check amount. Certain
non-recurring checks, such as a gift from a relative, may
also be cashed by the machines, within the bank's pre-defined
limit for the customer.
   Philadelphia National Bank, a unit of CoreStates, has been
testing prototypes of the new machine for about 14 months at
a branch in Newtown, Pa. Customers get money quickly, 24
hours a day, while bank tellers are relieved of
check-verification chores. CoreStates officials say new
accounts at the branch have doubled since the machine was
installed, and account closings have dropped 30%.
   "About 70% of a teller's time is spent dealing with checks
from the consumer," says Richard W. Epps, a CoreStates vice
president. "Our experience in Newtown is that half of those
checks have been moved from tellers to machines." As a
result, he says, the bank has been able to shift tellers to
other duties.
   Quicker access to the funds would be a big plus for U.S.
consumers, who made an estimated 490 million deposits by
using ATMs last year. But that volume could soon drop
sharply: A survey by the American Bankers Association
indicates that about 90% of commercial banks plan to stop
accepting customer deposits through ATMs, mainly because they
can't meet the new deadlines using their current equipment
without vulnerability to massive fraud.
   Ten financial institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region,
including Meridian Bancorp Inc. and Midlantic National Bank,
have signed up to use the new MAC machines. They expect to be
on-line by early 1991, a CoreStates spokesman says. Those
banks are already hooked up to CoreStates's own MAC system,
which is used by about 16.5 million cardholders in the
Northeast.
   Until now, the banking industry has given little
consideration to what marketing features could be added to
push ATM's into the next generation, Mr. Epps says.
"Paychecks and pension checks are the lifeline for
consumers," he says "and they need the money right away."
   Moreover, it has taken years for consumers to integrate
ATMs into their banking habits. "If you had predicted that
people would go up to an ATM and do a transaction of a CD,
you would have been laughed at," says Edward Alwood, an
automation issues specialist at the American Bankers
Association. But ATM use is accelerating "as the older
generation ages and the younger computer generation starts
banking," he says.
   The advanced machines are likely to boost CoreStates
profits. Historically, the bank holding company has generated
a large amount of its earnings, about 35%, from such
non-lending sources as fees from debit and credit cards, says
Joel Silberstein, a bank analyst at Advest Inc. in New York.
With assets of $22.2 billion after its acquisition in March
of First Pennsylvania Corp., CoreStates "clears more checks
than the Fed does itself in the Third District," says Mr.
Silberstein.
   A spokesman for NCR in Dayton, Ohio, says the company
expects to install about 1,500 of the new machines in 1991
and double the volume in 1992.
