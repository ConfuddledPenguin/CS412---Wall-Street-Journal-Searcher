   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- American Century Corp. said its
debenture holders have approved a reorganization plan under
which substantially all of its assets will be acquired by
Tescorp Inc., a Houston-based manufacturer and distributor of
oilfield products. Tescorp's shareholders also have approved
the plan, which now goes to a June 18 confirmation hearing
before a federal bankruptcy court.
   Under terms of the plan, the holder of a $1,000 American
Century debenture will receive 67 shares of Tescorp common
stock plus 86 shares of Tescorp convertible preferred stock
and warrants for an additional 245 shares of common. The
preferred stock initially will be convertible for $3.50 a
share and will receive cash dividends of 50 cents a year. The
warrants, which have a three-year term, have an initial
exercise price of $3.50 a share but that will escalate in the
second and third years.

   American Century stockholders will receive warrants with
the same terms and conditions for a total of 847,375 shares
of Tescorp common. American Century owned Commerce Savings
Association, a thrift that was placed in federal
conservatorship last year.
   Tescorp said it has applied to list its common stock,
preferred stock and warrants on the NASD automated quotation
system. Its unaudited results of operations for the 12 months
ending March 31 showed a net loss of $955,000 on revenue of
$20.7 million, compared with net income of $1 million on
revenue of $21.4 million in the previous year.
