   Great Western Financial Corp. is under scrutiny by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for possible violations of
disclosure and accounting rules.
   Great Western, a big thrift based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., disclosed in an SEC filing that the agency has begun
an "informal inquiry" centering on Great Western's $200
million of fourth-quarter write-downs and additions to
loan-loss reserves.

   In general, informal inquiries are designed to determine
whether enough grounds exist for the SEC to pursue a formal
investigation, which can lead to civil or criminal charges.
   In the filing, Great Western said the agency contacted it
on June 8 and requested documents related to the company's
1989 consolidated financial statements. It said the SEC
informed Great Western that it was inquiring into "timing"
and "internal controls" related to the write-downs and
loan-loss provisions.
   Great Western said in the filing that it believes the
financial statements "fairly present its financial position
and its provision and write-down were properly recorded." A
spokesman declined to elaborate.
   The $200 million of write-downs and reserve additions
chopped Great Western's net income for 1989 to $100.1
million, or 78 cents a share, from a year-earlier $248.4
million, or $1.95 a share. The charges erased gains in Great
Western's core lending operations, which continued to perform
well in the first quarter, when Great Western earned $74.2
million, or 58 cents a share. In last year's first quarter,
Great Western had profit of $57.2 million, or 45 cents a
share. The thrift has relatively strong capitalization, with
tangible capital of 4.8% of assets.
   Some industry executives suggested that the SEC's interest
in Great Western might indicate the agency, like other
regulatory bodies, is taking a tougher look at thrifts in
light of the S&amp;L debacle. Regulators -- including the SEC --
have been bitterly criticized by some politicians and
industry officials for permitting some thrift operators to
run amok, contributing to a financial disaster that now is
expected to cost anywhere from $325 billion to $500 billion.
   The Great Western inquiry was disclosed after the market
closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, the stock closed at $18.875, down $1.625.
