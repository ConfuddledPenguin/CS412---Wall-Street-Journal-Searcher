   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. agreed to buy most of American
Cyanamid Co.'s men's toiletries and fragrance business for
between $300 million and $370 million.
   The purchase gives P&amp;G the popular Old Spice brand, along
with the Sante Fe brand of toiletries, to add to its cabinet
of personal and beauty-care products.

   For American Cyanamid, a Wayne, N.J., chemical company,
the sale is a major step in its efforts to shed its Shulton
Group of consumer products, which has posted lackluster
results in recent quarters.
   The final pricetag for P&amp;G will depend on how much
American Cyanamid can get in a separate sale of its Breck
hair-care and Lady's Choice personal-care products business.
P&amp;G said it guaranteed American Cyanamid $370 million for the
combined sales.
   American Cyanamid said it is negotiating to sell Shulton's
household-products business, which includes Pine-Sol cleaner
and Combat insecticides. Shulton's Pierre Cardin fragrances
aren't included in the P&amp;G deal.
   The Old Spice brand of deodorant builds P&amp;G's strength in
that market, where it already holds a 24% share with its Sure
and Secret brands. Old Spice has about 4% of that market,
analysts said.
   The Old Spice and Sante Fe men's fragrances mark P&amp;G's
first move into that market. With its purchase last year of
Noxell Corp., P&amp;G moved into the women's fragrances market
with the Navy brand of perfume.
   Analysts said the Old Spice brands share distribution to
drug stores and mass marketers, where Noxell sells its Cover
Girl and Clarion lines of makeup. "It's a good fit with other
mass-market cosmetics," said Bonita Austin, analyst with
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York.
   P&amp;G is sure to address Old Spice's advertising. American
Cyanamid had tried to revamp the brand with new ads to move
away from the sailor image of previous campaigns. One recent
commercial, shot in Paris, featured a Frenchman with "a
passion for American things."
   But the company curbed spending last year as it looked to
control costs in the division, analysts said. That should
change under P&amp;G's ownership. "P&amp;G may not have the most
dynamic ad copy, but it has the ability to create some
excitement" with the brand, said Lynne Hyman of First Boston.
   P&amp;G also is expected to expand the brand's world-wide
sales. Edwin L. Artzt, P&amp;G chairman and chief executive
officer, called the Old Spice brand "a strong foothold" in a
market with growth potential.
   Some analysts figure the purchase will mildly dilute P&amp;G's
1991 earnings. Ms. Austin put the dilution at three or four
cents a share, with her earnings estimate at $5.20 a share
for the year.
   The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
