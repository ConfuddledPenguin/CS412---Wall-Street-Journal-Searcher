   Kevin Phillips begins from a promising point: the
intellectual bankruptcy of both the Bush administration and
its Democratic opposition. The moment is brief, alas. For by
Mr. Phillips's lights, this bipartisan shortcoming stems from
a reluctance to undo the economic and cultural legacy of
Ronald Reagan.
   It is this legacy that Mr. Phillips seeks to elucidate in
"The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth and the American
Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath" (Random House, 262 pages,
$19.95). While Mr. Phillips, a well-known political analyst
based in Washington., D.C., proves glaringly ill-equipped for
the task, the book should be instructive nevertheless to
historians of the 1980s as a precious relic of the opinion
elite's anti-Reagan sophistry, especially its misreporting of
"Reaganomics."

   Of course, this very fact ensures Mr. Phillips
enthusiastic notices from the culture police, all the more
since his Republican credentials are seen to bestow a certain
gravitas to analyses that unfailingly jibe with prevailing
left-liberal prejudices.
   The book purports to be about history, politics and
economics. Let's take these in reverse sequence. Grudgingly,
the author acknowledges the unbroken 90-month record of
economic growth, the new jobs, high-tech innovations and
surging exports of the Reagan-Bush watch. But, oh, there are
the familiar (and contradictory) bogeymen: the budget and
trade deficits, the "foreign invasion" of America, the
"bicoastal economy," "the low-paying service economy," "paper
entrepreneurialism" and "economic polarization."
   Each of these is either a distortion or a canard. The
federal deficit as a percent of GNP has fallen to an
estimated 2.6% this year from 5.4% in 1985. If U.S. assets
were valued at current prices, the U.S. still would be a net
creditor. Increased foreign capital inflows and trade
deficits are a sign of health in the economy, not sickness.
   The crux of the author's case is an accounting of "who
profited and who lost" under Reagan. But flipping to Appendix
C, beginning with the first full year of the Reagan recovery
(1983), tabulations of per capita income and median family
income reveal an almost perfectly uniform rise. Evidence that
"the poor got poorer" is at best inconclusive. What really
happened was that all income groups traded up.
   Mr. Phillips wants to pin the natural creative and
destructive dynamics of the market on President Reagan's
"abusive, self-serving, new conservative money culture." But
even on government-set tax policy, he can't make the argument
stick. During the 1980s, he reports, the percentage of total
federal income tax payments by the top 1% of taxpayers rose,
while effective tax rates for the bottom 20% fell.
   What we are left with, then, is an Andy Rooney-like
indictment based not on macroeconomic trends, but on
anomalies and manners. The U.S.-Canada free-trade pact is an
overall boon, but not if you ask the Iowa pig farmer hurt by
Canadian imports. At one summit meeting, Japan's prime
minister requested a motorcycle escort as large as Mr.
Reagan's. The nerve] In a book that aims to paint the Big
Picture, the analytical force of such vignettes is exactly
nil.
   Indeed, all this book really demonstrates is how much the
author's high-toned sensibilities were deeply miffed by
"Darwinism and Babbitry," "Boone Pickens and Ivan Boesky,"
"stretch limos and $300 cowboy boots," "champagne and
raspberries," "hustling middle-class Reagan aides and
right-wing economists," "Rodeo Drive, Sutton Place and the
Florida Gold Coast."
   Such images pepper entire chapters filled with nothing but
lists. Lists of billionaires, and centimillionaires, and
decamillionaires. Lists of the "Wall Street 100" and the
"largest golden parachutes." Lists of international bank
assets by nationality, and foreign-owned U.S. publishing
enterprises.
   All of which, in Mr. Phillips's estimation, is breeding
today a "populist rebellion" against "gunslinger capitalism"
reminiscent of the supposed public backlash against the
Gilded Age and the Roaring Twenties. He believes this
paradigm produced presidential wins for "reformists" in 1896
and 1932; by implication, 1992 should be a Democratic
triumph. (It's worth noting that he intimated the same for
1984 in the gloomy 1982 tome "Post-Conservative America.")
   Political prognostication is the author's metier, but here
too he strikes false notes. It is difficult to imagine a
populist backlash against Reaganism, which was, to the teeth,
anti-elitist: "Corporate raiding" forced change on bloated
Fortune 500 bluebloods, as did deregulation on high-paid
unionists in coddled industries. But then, Mr. Phillips's
favorite "populist" has always been Richard Nixon, with his
wage-and-price controls, food stamps and detente.
   Mr. Phillips acknowledges that the political victories to
which he harks back came amid economic depressions. These
were brought on not by unrestrained freemarket policies, as
he would have it, but by their abandonment.
   So the only prospect for the author's predictions is a
counterrevolution from above, so to speak, in which a
Republican administration hangs itself by yielding to
tax-hungry, regulation-happy redistributionists. As it
happens, this is precisely the course Mr. Phillips urges --
perhaps superfluously -- on President Bush.
