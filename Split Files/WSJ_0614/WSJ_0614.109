   DALLAS -- American brand names are big business in Japan
-- big enough to entice Tsurukame Corp. to license the name
of Zale Corp., the giant U.S. jewelry store chain.
   Officials of Tsurukame, Japan's second-largest jewelry
store chain, have just completed initial training in Zale's
merchandising techniques at the company's Dallas
headquarters, said Zale president Irving R. Gerstein, and
expect to open their first Zale franchise in downtown Tokyo
in September. Initial plans, he added, are for 200 stores
within five years, with Zale receiving an undisclosed
percentage of retail sales for use of its name.

   "It's a no-lose situation for us," said Mr. Gerstein, who
attributed Tsurukame's interest to a Japanese fascination
with American brand names.
   The arrangement includes an agreement by Zale to buy a 1%
stake in Tsurukame for 160 million yen ($1 million). Zale,
the world's largest jewelry store chain, is owned jointly by
Peoples Jewellers Ltd. of Toronto, and by Swarovski
International Holding A.G., a Swiss firm.
