   WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association
named Dale P. Riordan as executive vice president for
operations and systems, succeeding Samuel A. Alward, who will
become a technical adviser on information technology to
Fannie Mae's president.
   Robert J. Levin, whose most recent post at Fannie Mae has
been senior vice president for marketing and mortgage-backed
securities, was chosen to succeed Mr. Riordan as Fannie Mae's
executive vice president for marketing.

   Larry H. Dale will take Mr. Levin's former post. He will
retain his current responsibilities as senior vice president
for multifamily finance and housing initiatives until a
successor is named.
   Fannie Mae's chairman, David Maxwell, said that with the
completion of the huge job of computerizing details on six
million mortgages, "Fannie Mae needs to integrate fully its
business side with the company's information technology
capacities."
