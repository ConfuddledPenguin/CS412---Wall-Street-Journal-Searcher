   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing $22.28
billion of Chrysler Corp. debt for possible downgrade.
   The review comes in the wake of "recent management
defections" and reflects Moody's concerns about the auto
maker's "financial flexibility" to compete in an increasingly
competitive market, the credit rating service said.

   In a statement, Moody's said its analysis will focus
primarily on the "prospects for improvement in the trend of
Chrysler's operating performance and market share in the next
several years."
   Moody's announcement came after the market closed
yesterday. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading,
Chrysler stock closed at $15.875 a share, down 37.5 cents.
   Harold H. Goldberg, chairman of Moody's corporate rating
committee, said the rating on most Chrysler debt is now "two
refined notches away from the speculative rating category."
He said Moody's hopes to decide within two weeks if ratings
will be lowered.
   Any downward move will hurt Chrysler in several ways,
including making it more expensive for the auto maker to
raise money in the credit markets and generally hurting its
financial image at a time when it doesn't need any more bad
news.
   Last month, the auto maker said it was abandoning efforts
to sell its defense-related operations because it didn't get
any satisfactory offers. But the company did sell Gulfstream
Aerospace for $825 million in March.
   Within the past five weeks, four top executives have
announced departures. Gerald Greenwald, the former vice
chairman and heir apparent to Chairman Lee A. Iacocca,
resigned late last month to head a proposed employee buy-out
at United Airlines. Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of
Chrysler's Chrysler Motors unit, said he wants to retire on
Jan. 1, 1991 but is willing to change his plans if he is
"really needed."
   Chrysler's treasurer plans to leave this summer and the
vice president of international operations resigned to take a
top job at Black &amp; Decker Corp.
   The auto maker insists the departures are purely
coincidental, but Mr. Iacocca last week said he now will stay
at Chrysler beyond the 1991 expiration of his contract; he
didn't say how long he will remain.
   Moody's said it will examine the impact of these moves on
"the success of Chrysler's strategy to improve its
competitive position." Chrysler must sell more cars in the
future and that challenge "requires the strongest possible
management," said Moody's Mr. Goldberg.
   Moody's also will analyze Chrysler's ability to "reverse
its declining automotive market share" before new vehicles
come out in 1991 and 1992. Chrysler's share of the U.S. car
market declined sharply from February through April, with
Japanese auto makers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.
besting it several times. In May, however, Chrysler's share
began to improve, even though its 9.7% slice of all cars sold
in the U.S. was still below last year's 10.9% level.
   Over the past two years, Chrysler has killed off some 20
nameplates but has been slow to bring any replacement
products to market. The company won't have a new, high-volume
car line until at least 1992; it will introduce new minivans
this fall, but updated Jeep models are still many months
away.
   Moody's noted that the "increasingly intense competitive
environment," particularly for the profitable Jeeps and
minivans, raises questions about Chrysler's ability to
generate the "substantial capital" needed to expand its
product line.
   The Highland Park, Mich., company called Moody's action
"inappropriate and unwarranted." The No. 3 U.S. auto maker
pointed to the unanticipated $5 million profit it earned in
the first quarter of 1990 on its automotive operations as
evidence that a $1.5 billion cost-cutting program it adopted
last year is working. Chrysler officials also recently noted
that the company has some $4 billion in cash and marketable
securities.
   The auto maker said it "plans to continue without
interruption its $15 billion product spending program and
believes that its business in 1990 will continue to improve."
   Among the ratings under review are the Baa-2 rating for
Chrysler Corp. senior debt and the (P)Baa-2 rating on the
company's shelf registration.
   Moody's also is reviewing ratings for Chrysler Financial
Corp., including the Baa-2 rating on its senior debt and the
Baa-3 rating on its senior subordinated debt.
