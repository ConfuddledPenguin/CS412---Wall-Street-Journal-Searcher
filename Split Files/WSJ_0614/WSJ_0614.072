   SAN FRANCISCO -- Despite widespread knowledge about AIDS,
high levels of risky sexual behavior persist among black gay
and bisexual men, according to a survey.
   The study, sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, raises fresh concern about the adequacy of education
programs designed to halt the spread of the epidemic among
minorities, who are at extreme risk of the disease due to
factors related to poverty and drug use.

   Of 132,510 cases of AIDS reported to CDC through April
1990, 36,682 cases or more than one-fourth were among blacks
-- a burden far exceeding their slice of the population at
large.
   Of 952 black gay and bisexual men in the survey, nearly
all (97%) understood how the virus is spread, through sexual
and blood contact. However, only half of the respondents said
they always or almost always engage in safer sex practices,
such as condom use.
   Moreover, a third of the respondents said they sometimes
engage in sex with women. Of this group, only 20% regularly
use a condom, according to the survey. The findings follow
reports earlier this spring about the problem of behavioral
"relapse" from safer-sex among gay men at large.
   "While they've heard the message of AIDS, it hasn't
translated into safe-sex behavior all the time," said study
director Reggie Williams, executive director of the National
Task Force on AIDS Prevention of the National Association of
Black and White Men Together.
   Mr. Williams said he hoped the study would serve as a spur
to fund more aggressive programs of outreach and education,
designed to reach minority populations. Few of the survey
respondents were aware, for example, that blacks die of AIDS
at a five times faster rate than do whites, he said.
   "Education programs need to be targeted to the black gay
and bisexual communities," he said. "We hope that will help
them to do what they need to do to save their lives."
   Drug use and unsafe behavior are closely intertwined, the
survey confirmed, with 6.5% of respondents saying they
regularly use cocaine, crack cocaine or heroin during sex.
About 4% said they had shared needles, and 30% have had
unprotected sex, with someone now known to carry the virus.
   As a result, there was a high level of AIDS anxiety among
respondents, and it is well-founded. Almost 60% of
respondents said they had been tested for antibodies to the
AIDS virus, and almost one-third of those tested positive.
About 6.5% of men in the survey are currently diagnosed with
AIDS or AIDS-related complex, a precursor condition.
