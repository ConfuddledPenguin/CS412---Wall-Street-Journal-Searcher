   In your May 15 editorial "Community Standards Elevated"
you hail Judge Frank Altimari's opinion that begging in the
subway "often amounts to nothing less than assault" on
passengers. I don't know if you or the appeals judges
actually ride the subways, but as a daily passenger I can say
with total honesty that I've never felt "assaulted" or
endangered by beggars. Annoyed, often; depressed, always; but
assaulted, never.
   I'll tell you what does scare me a little: It's the notion
of "common good." You're quick to raise this banner against a
class of people you dislike, but think what might happen if
it fell into the wrong hands, especially the hands of certain
"L"-type people. Tougher emission standards, compulsory car
pooling, seizure of warehoused apartments, more affirmative
action, universal health insurance, all for the "common
good." Is it really worth opening such a Pandora's box just
to throw a few beggars out of the subway?
</LP>

   I've always admired your deft, totally unembarrassed use
of double standards; it's one reason I find your editorials
so much fun. But be careful how you handle principles, they
may backfire.
