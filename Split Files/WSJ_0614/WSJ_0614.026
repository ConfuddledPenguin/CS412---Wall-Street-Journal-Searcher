   GLOBAL LABOR THREATS

   Violation of labor activists' rights was widespread in the
past year, with 250 people killed for engaging in routine
union activities, a trade-union group said.
   From March 1989 to March 1990, 13,000 workers were
detained and tens of thousands fired because of their union
activities, the Brussels-based International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions said.
   It said the most dangerous countries for labor activists
included China, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, the
Philippines, Sudan and South Africa. The report welcomed
positive changes in Chile, Namibia, Nicaragua and Eastern
Europe, with the exception of Albania, but said the global
picture was alarming.
   "In many countries," the group said, "trade unionists
still live constantly under the threat of assassination by
hired gunmen, death squads, guerrillas and even police and
security forces."
                                                                                                       

   SANYO ELECTRIC IN HUNGARY
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Sanyo Electric Co. will begin creating a sales
network for audio-visual products in Hungary early next year,
a company spokesman said. He said the project will be used as
a model for future ventures in other Eastern European
countries. Sanyo Electric plans to begin activities in
Hungary this summer by using two demonstration vehicles, from
which products will be sold. The company also plans to open a
showroom in Budapest.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPE'S AIR DELAYS
                                                                                                       

   Crowded skies over Europe last year caused the worst
air-travel delays on record, said the Association of European
Airlines in a report. Almost 25% of all flights left more
than 15 minutes late. "In terms of punctuality, 1989 was the
bleakest year yet," the association said. The report said
there was little hope of major improvement in 1990. The
association's 21 member airlines carried almost 100 million
passengers in 1989, 6.9% more than in the previous year, and
expect the 100 million mark to be passed this year.
                                                                                                       

   BANKING IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   A senior Chinese official ruled out the possibility of
allowing foreign banks to engage in local-currency
transactions, dashing hopes that China would further open its
banking sector to foreign competition. Zhu Rongji, the mayor
of Shanghai, told a group of bankers in Hong Kong that "we
won't consider allowing foreign banks to take deposits and
make loans in the local currency at this stage." Mr. Zhu is
on a visit to Hong Kong to seek support for the development
of a Shanghai suburb.
                                                                                                       

   SAFETY OF BRITISH BEEF
                                                                                                       

   Scientists disputed the British government's assertion
that British beef is safe to eat following new measures to
fight "mad cow" disease. One of the scientists, Richard
Lacey, a former government health adviser, said actions taken
to restore confidence in the beef industry were superficial.
"We don't know if {British beef} is safe or not," he told a
parliamentary committee on agriculture. Last week, following
European Community negotiations, France, West Germany and
Italy ended bans on British beef imports. The bans had been
brought on by the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
which affects cows' brains.
                                                                                                       

   SCANDAL IN TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan prosecutors said they are investigating reports
that military officers and relatives of a senior presidential
aide were involved in a bribery scandal to supply 2.5 million
pairs of black socks to the army. The chief prosecutor of the
Taipei District Court said police have detained four persons,
including sock supplier Hsiao Chunliang. Police said Mr.
Hsiao claimed he paid three million New Taiwan dollars (about
$110,000) in bribes last year to government and military
officials to win a NT$50 million contract.
                                                                                                       

   MAIL-ORDER BRIDE BAN
                                                                                                       

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino signed a law banning
mail-order brides for foreigners.
   Mrs. Aquino said young women from the countryside were
lured "by sweet talk and grandiose promises" and often found
themselves heartbroken in a foreign land. The new law outlaws
advertising for wives for foreigners and bans clubs or
associations designed to match foreign nationals with
Filipinas. It specifies six to eight years in prison for
offenders.
   "Operated by unscrupulous and heartless individuals, the
{mail-order bride} practice has not only cast shame on our
women in the international community, but has also exposed
thousands of impoverished Filipinas to further misery in the
hands of their foreign spouses," said Congresswoman Lorna
Verano Yap.
   The law doesn't bar marriage between foreigners and
Filipinas but is an attempt to curb the business in young and
often ill-educated Filipinas attracted by ads to a life
abroad, the congresswoman said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Upperclassmen at Thailand's Khon Kaen University, fearful
of AIDS, abandoned a ritual of taking freshmen to brothels, a
Thai newspaper said. In place of the outing this spring was
an AIDS lecture. . . . Japanese Finance Minister Tyutaro
Hashimoto confirmed he suggested to the cabinet a review of
Japan's higher-education policies in response to Japan's
declining birthrate. But he denied reports that he believes
the trend for Japanese women to obtain higher education is
behind the birthrate decline. "I am afraid we will not be
able to discuss this matter seriously now," he said.
