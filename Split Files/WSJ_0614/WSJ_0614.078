   WASHINGTON -- A House Appropriations subcommittee approved
a $15.8 billion fiscal 1991 foreign operations bill that
would cut U.S. military aid by 12.5% outside the Mideast and
substantially increase economic assistance to Africa and
Eastern Europe.
   More than $1.1 billion would be cut from President Bush's
budget for grants to finance military sales. And the measure
imposes new limits lowering U.S. military aid to Greece and
Turkey to 20% under current appropriations levels.

   Assistance for Eastern Europe would grow to about $500
million, or almost $200 million above the Bush
administration's request, and the Democratic-controlled panel
approved $800 million for sub-Saharan Africa, a 40% increase
above current funding.
   The Africa funding was combined with new restrictions
practically denying any direct funding to Zaire's Mobutu
regime. Elsewhere, the bill would significantly tighten a
prior congressional ban on the use of Export-Import Bank
financing for trade with Iraq.
   Within Central America, 50% of new military aid to El
Salvador would be withheld in an effort to promote a peace
settlement. And the bill requires that the U.S. withhold its
support for the World Bank in proportion to any bank loans
issued to China for non-basic human needs.
   Adopted on a party line 8-4 vote, the measure is sure to
face opposition from the administration. But committee
Republicans openly conceded their own frustration in crafting
an alternative package with the White House and State
Department. "There ain't nobody home," said Rep. Mickey
Edwards (R., Okla.). And more than any bill yet this year,
the drafting process reflected the tugs and pulls as
Washington attempts to adjust to a changing world.
   The fine print runs from $150,000 for a labor-statistics
program for the Soviets and Czechoslovakians to a University
of Chicago feasibility study to revive ancient irrigation
methods in the high plateaus of Bolivia. The African aid
reflects a major initiative by the House Black Caucus to
become more of a player in shaping foreign aid, while ethnic,
Midwest politics are a factor behind a provision urging the
West to forgive past loans to Poland.
   The fight over military aid is a harbinger of what is to
come on the defense budget, and U.S. arms contractors are
increasingly looking to foreign sales as military spending is
reduced at home. The administration had sought to increase
aid to more than $5 billion, and most of this assistance
would come in the form of direct grants. By comparison, the
proposed House bill would bring down U.S. aid to under $4.5
billion and distribute this under a less generous formula
that includes loans as well as grants.
   The foreign operations measure is the fourth of the major
fiscal 1991 spending bills to be drafted in the past week.
While no agreement has yet been reached on a final budget
resolution, the legislation set in motion in the House
already covers at least six executive departments as well as
space and environmental agencies.
   Bills for the Energy, State, Justice, and Commerce
Departments cleared the House Appropriations Committee
yesterday, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said he
hoped that agreement could be reached on a provisional
resolution in the Senate to allow action there as well.
   As this pressure has built, there is continued concern in
the administration that the new spending ceilings set in the
varied appropriations bills will weaken the White House's
position in budget talks with Congress. Allocations approved
by the full House committee yesterday shift billions of
dollars from military accounts to housing and domestic
initiatives.
   And while Republican lawmakers complained, they also have
been among the most active in securing funds for everything
from home-state universities in Massachusetts and Michigan to
water projects in rural Kentucky.
   "Today is the high water mark. . . . reality will soon set
in," said Massachusetts Rep. Silvio Conte, the ranking
Republican on the House Appropriations panel. "Enjoy."
