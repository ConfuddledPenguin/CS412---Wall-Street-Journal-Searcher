   TORONTO -- Toronto's Reichmann family said it will boost
its offer to buy out minority shareholders of GW Utilities
Ltd. to 40 Canadian dollars (US$34.13).
   A spokesman for the Reichmann's closely held holding
company, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., said the offer was
increased by C$4 a share "to reflect the potential increase
in the value of the shares as a result of transactions
announced since the going-private proposal was made."

   In January, Olympia &amp; York proposed to offer shareholders
C$36 a share, subject to shareholder approval at a special
meeting. The company already holds an 89.3% stake in GW
Utilities.
   Since then, GW Utilities has announced plans to tender its
82% stake in Consumers' Gas Co. to a C$1.1 billion bid by
British Gas PLC. In April, Olympia &amp; York announced a
reshuffling of its other energy assets, which would see GW
Utilities's subsidiary, Home Oil Co., merge with Gulf Canada
Resources Ltd., 74.3% owned by Olympia &amp; York.
   If either of those transactions don't receive necessary
shareholder and regulatory approvals, the Reichmann spokesman
said Olympia &amp; York "would come back with another
privatization offer {for GW Utilities} similar to the first
one."
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, GW
Utilities closed at C$35, up 88 Canadian cents.
