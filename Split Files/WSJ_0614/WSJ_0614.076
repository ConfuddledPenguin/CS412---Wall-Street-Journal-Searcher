   NEW YORK -- Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., in an
attempt to turn its fortunes around, forced out its
president, W. James Tozer Jr., and named a veteran Prudential
Insurance Co. of America executive, Arthur H. Burton Jr., to
be vice chairman.
   This is Mr. Burton's second stint at the insurer's
Prudential-Bache brokerage unit. The 56-year-old executive
most recently was senior vice president and head of human
resources at Prudential; in 1988, he briefly was assistant to
Prudential-Bache's chairman and chief executive officer,
George Ball.

   Prudential-Bache said in a statement that Mr. Tozer,
president for 16 months, resigned "to seek a management
challenge as a chief executive, probably in a
financial-service industry turnaround situation." But
Prudential-Bache executives privately said Mr. Tozer was
forced out to bolster the firm's profitability.
   Mr. Tozer, who had worked in the banking industry before
joining Prudential-Bache, couldn't be reached to comment.
Last year, Prudential-Bache, the nation's fourth-largest
securities firm with about 6,500 brokers, had a loss of $51
million.
   Mr. Burton will join Mr. Ball, the chief executive, and
James Gahan, president of Prudential-Bache Capital Funding,
as a member of Prudential-Bache's office of the chairman. In
his new post, Mr. Burton will oversee the firm's mutual
funds, risk arbitrage and administration operations.
   In an interview, Mr. Burton said his biggest challenge is
"regaining profitability" for the firm and pushing its staff
to be more efficient. He plans to do that by helping the firm
create products, including mutual funds. And he said he will
help promote the firm's selling more of its own mutual funds,
a recent trend among big securities firms.
   Last year, 65% of all funds sold by Prudential-Bache
brokers were those the firm itself manages. Prudential-Bache,
like most other securities firms, pays its brokers more for
selling in-house funds than outside portfolios.
Prudential-Bache is the nation's 11th-largest mutual-fund
manager, with assets of more than $35 billion.
   Mr. Burton joined Prudential in 1955. He was named
regional group manager in the Prudential's Eastern Home
Office in 1965. He also held several other posts at the
company, including a stint as president of North Central
operations, until he joined Prudential-Bache in 1988.
   In a memo to employees, Mr. Ball described Mr. Tozer as "a
valuable and hard working manager." Mr. Ball also said
Prudential-Bache won't fill the president's post.
   "Many businesses today are opting for this type of
structure to avoid barrierism of various kinds," Mr. Ball
said in the memo. He added, "There are no hidden agendas in
this."
   Separately, Prudential-Bache said its international group,
headed by William Custard, now will report to Leland Paton,
president of the Capital Markets group of Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding, which includes the global investment
banking, institutional and capital markets divisions of the
firm.
