   CHICAGO -- Eight of the country's major futures exchanges
today will begin a counterattack against the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission's moves to restrict dual trading.
   The exchanges, trying to pressure the federal regulator
into not curbing the practice, will argue in two reports that
a CFTC study of dual trading doesn't merit curbing it.

   "All of the conclusions of the CFTC study are either
wrong, misleading or unsupported by the empirical results,"
one of the exchange reports concludes. The exchanges intend
to deliver the reports to CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm today.
   Dual trading, currently permitted by the exchanges, allows
futures traders to simultaneously trade for customers and for
their own accounts. Critics say the practice encourages
traders to cheat customers by reserving the most profitable
trades for themselves.
   In January, the CFTC endorsed a limited test ban on dual
trading in some of the exchanges' most heavily traded futures
contracts. A spokesman for the CFTC said the commission will
mull the exchanges' arguments before making a final decision
on the dual-trading restrictions.
   "It's not beyond the realm of reality that the commission
will say, `We were wrong. Let's do some more study or modify
our stance,'" said a CFTC spokesman. "But the commission also
may stand by its conclusions."
   Any CFTC decision on dual-trading restrictions could be
superseded by pending legislation in Congress.
   The House has approved a provision that would prohibit
dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000
contracts or more. A Senate bill, which is awaiting a vote,
would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange
can't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading
abuses.
   The CFTC's proposed dual-trading restrictions are widely
regarded as a response to last year's Federal Bureau of
Investigation "sting" operation at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   The probe uncovered widespread trading abuses at the
exchanges. Since then, 48 indictments have been brought
against traders, and trials have begun in some cases. Other
traders have pleaded guilty.
   The CFTC has proposed curbing dual trading according to
the sizes of the futures exchanges over a 12-month "phase-in"
period.
   During the period, the CBOT and the Chicago Merc, the
nation's largest futures exchanges, would be required to
restrict the practice in one of their three most popular
agricultural contracts and one of their two largest financial
contracts.
   Medium-sized exchanges, such as the New York Mercantile
Exchange and the Mid-America Commodity Exchange, would have
to curb dual trading in one of their two largest commodity
contracts. Small exchanges, such as the Kansas City Board of
Trade in Missouri, would be exempt during the period.
   The exchanges would decide which contracts would be
restricted.
   Over the 12 months, the CFTC would analyze trading
patterns and then decide whether to impose permanent
dual-trading restrictions.
   The planned restrictions are based on a CFTC staff
analysis released in November. The study concluded that dual
trading offers no particular financial benefits, while
encouraging traders to break exchange rules.
   In the exchanges' reports, professors from Duke University
and the University of California at Berkeley argue that the
CFTC's conclusions are based on faulty statistical analysis.
   "It's crazy on the basis of that analysis to go out and
ban something that's been in existence for more than a
decade," said Thomas Smith, a business school professor who
co-wrote one of the reports.
   Prof. Smith wouldn't say how much he and his research
partner, Prof. Robert Whaley of Duke, were paid by the
exchanges to do their study. The second study was written by
Berkeley professors Raymond L. Hartman and Gordon Rausser.
   Because the reports weren't due to be released until
today, exchange executives wouldn't comment on them publicly.
   "We're hoping it will make the CFTC re-evaluate its
proposed curbs on dual trading," said an official at one
Chicago exchange, who asked not to be identified. "It's
unclear how much impact these types of things have, except
you do have eight of the nine largest futures exchanges in
the country all taking a swing at them at the same time."
   In addition to the CBOT and the Merc, the exchanges that
sponsored the reports were the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange in New York; the Kansas City Board of Trade; the
Minneapolis Grain Exchange; the New York Cotton Exchange; the
New York Futures Exchange; and the Commodity Exchange of New
York.
