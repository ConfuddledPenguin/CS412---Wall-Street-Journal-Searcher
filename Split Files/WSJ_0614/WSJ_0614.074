   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West German wholesale prices
were up 0.3% in May from April, but they rose by just 0.2%
from May 1989, the Federal Statistics Office said.
   The year-to-year rate of increase was 0.6% in March and
0.1% in April.

   The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said that the
index for wholesale prices (1985 equals 100) climbed to 95.3
in May, from 95.0 in April, and was up from 95.1 in May 1989.
   The wholesale price index is a volatile indicator on a
month-to-month basis. On a year-to-year basis, wholesale
prices had risen as high as 4.2% in November, before slipping
to as low as 0.6% on an annual basis in February and March,
helped by a steep decline in import prices.
