   AFTER A DAY OF MEETINGS, 150 National Broadcasting Co.
executives on a recent management retreat in Miami got down
to real business. With mops, brushes and shovels, and led by
NBC President Robert Wright, the executives spent the next
day cleaning, painting and landscaping a decrepit day-care
center in a Coconut Grove ghetto.
   It's no solution to ratings wars, but this sweat-equity
approach to corporate philanthropy at NBC is more than
altruism. Since last year, NBC and other General Electric Co.
subsidiaries and divisions have used volunteer work projects
as a way not only to do good, but also to build team spirit
and office morale.
   GE pays for the materials, but the employees give their
time to the projects, which have the informal support of GE's
chairman, John F. Welch Jr. Participation isn't mandatory,
says a GE spokeswoman. "It's personal involvement."
   Joel Hutt, a middle-manager in the marketing department of
the company's plastics group, is credited with starting the
idea. Mr. Hutt proposed that a get-acquainted meeting between
managers in his group and those in a newly acquired
subsidiary be given a purpose, in this case renovation of a
tired San Diego YMCA.
   The first day of the meeting was all GE business, but on
the second day, forgoing the usual golf and tennis, the 480
managers involved built concrete walls, brushed on 550
gallons of paint, and made over the seedy building for a
total cost in materials, paid by GE, of $100,000. A local
utility provided wheelbarrows and ladders.
   Working in teams of 10 or 15 each, the managers became
acquainted -- and had a good time. "It worked beyond our
wildest expectations," says Mr. Hutt.
   Since then GE teams have renovated eight other run-down
facilities used by the poor and needy. Typical is the Anna
Baum Skane  school for mentally handicapped children in
Bridgeport, Conn. There, an eight-hour visit by 200 GE
managers this past fall brought new lighting, windows,
playground equipment, shrubbery and a hot-pink paint job to
once-drab classrooms. "They did a magnificent job," says Rose
Loughlin, principal.
   The NBC project in Miami, which cost the company $170,000,
involved an old building -- originally built as a horse barn
for city garbage wagons -- that today serves as a community
center for disadvantaged children. Professionals repaired the
leaky roof, but NBC executives painted it inside and out and
planted six 20-foot trees.
   The top brass at NBC planned the event months in advance,
but most of the participants didn't learn about it until
dinner on the evening before, when waiters appeared dressed
in hard hats and jeans. The head table had a dropcloth with a
smeared-paint design and dining tables had paint roller
centerpieces.
   "The closer we came to the actual work date the more
skeptical we had become about the idea," recalls Betty
Hudson, an NBC senior vice president who planted flowers and
spread cedar chips that day. But 99% of the officials who
were asked to help came, she says.
   "At the end of the day I certainly was tired, but I felt
good," says Alan Thiel, business manager of NBC's Miami
affiliate, WTVJ.
   The idea is beginning to spread. On June 28, one of GE's
suppliers, Skyline Displays, a maker of portable trade show
exhibits, plans to complete a new playground and landscape
improvements in the local town park at Burnsville, Minn. The
company will provide the $60,000 in materials; 600 Skyline
managers and employees will do the work. Skyline says it read
in a trade magazine about a GE "Share to Gain" project and
decided to try one of its own.
