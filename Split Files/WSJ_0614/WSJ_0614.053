   NEW YORK -- Worse-than-expected retail sales for May drove
bond prices higher as investors happily contemplated lower
interest rates.
   Lower rates play well in the stock market, too, but
investors worried that sluggish economic growth might
deteriorate to the point of hurting profits and, in turn,
stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed
briefly into record territory in midafternoon, then eased
back to close at 2929.95, down 3.47 in moderately active
trading.

   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose nearly
seven-eighths of a point, or nearly $8.75 for each $1,000 of
face amount, in active trading. The dollar was down against
the West German mark and up against the Japanese yen, but
much of the action in this global market involved currencies
other than the dollar.
   The government report on May retail sales -- showing a
sharp decline rather than an expected weak rise -- raised
expectations that the Federal Reserve Board may ease interest
rates in order to stave off recession.
   Stock prices probably would have fallen further on the
news of lower consumer spending, but investors in this market
also like to fantasize about the Fed lowering rates. In
addition, the drop in bond yields that accompanies a rise in
bond prices makes stock investments look comparatively more
attractive.
   In the stock market, "it wasn't a bad day for a down day,"
said Joseph McAlinden, Dillon Read research director, noting
that the volume of trading in declining stocks wasn't much
greater than in advancers.
   Gary Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial
Group, Providence, R.I., said the retail-sales report is "bad
news for the growth indicators, and the stock market is
reacting in a way that says, `Whoops.' Investors like to
celebrate lower interest rates, but not at the expense of
economic growth."
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp.,
Minneapolis, said he feels the retail-sales figure is a more
important indicator than the inflation indicators due out
today and tomorrow. "After the weak employment numbers we've
seen, a decline in retail sales means the economy continues
to be weak and raises concern about recession," he said.
   The dollar didn't move on the retail-sales report,
however, Mr. Sohn said. "Foreign exchange is much more
sensitive to trade and inflation numbers," he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Moderately active trading totaled 158.9
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where
declining issues outnumbered advancers, 786 to 722.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.38%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6865 marks and 154.75 yen, compared
with 1.6965 marks and 154.55 yen Tuesday.
