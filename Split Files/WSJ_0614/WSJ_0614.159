   WALT DISNEY Co. (Burbank, Calif.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. upgraded its ratings on the entertainment
company's senior debt to double-A-3 from single-A-2, and
assigned a single-A-1 rating to Disney's prospective $1.5
billion offering of subordinated liquid yield option notes.
About $1.8 billion of debt is affected. The rating concern
said its actions recognized the "enviable performance
achieved by Disney as it has expanded its established
franchises and materially increased their revenue and profit
potential." The ratings are also based on Moody's
expectations that Disney "will continue to take advantage of
related opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, with
its high discretionary cash flow an important source of
funding." Moody's noted that while ratings of Disney's debt
have historically reflected the company's expressed interest
in acquisitions, "the balance sheet and cash flow are now
sufficiently strong to support a material acquisition within
the framework of anticipated fund generation."

   PRIMERICA Corp. (New York) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it upgraded its ratings on about $3 billion in debt
of this financial-services company's Commercial Credit Co.
and Primerica Holdings Inc. subsidiaries and the A.L.
Williams unit of Primerica Holdings. A major factor in the
upgrade is a recently adopted debt indenture, restricting
intersubsidiary investments, said Stephen Shippie, analyst at
the rating concern. The new indenture, Moody's said, "will
serve to insulate {Commercial Credit} from extending its
strengths to support weaker affiliates." The action includes
boosting the senior notes of Commercial Credit to single-A-2
from Baa-1 and the senior notes of Primerica Holdings to
Baa-1 from Baa-2.
