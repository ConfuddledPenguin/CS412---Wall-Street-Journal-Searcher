   The New Zealand government chose Ameritech and Bell
Atlantic Corp. as joint buyers of Telecom Corp., its
state-owned telephone company, for about $2.46 billion.
   As part of the agreement, two New Zealand companies, the
Freightways Holdings Ltd. conglomerate and Fay, Richwhite
Holdings Ltd. merchant bank, will buy a stake of less than 1%
in Telecom that will increase to 10% in the next three years.
During the same period, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech will
reduce their combined stake to 49.9% by making a series of
public stock offerings in New Zealand, Britain and the U.S.,
beginning as early as 1991.

   The joint purchase represents an overseas coup for the two
regional Bell telephone companies, both of which view the
move as a strategic opportunity. In winning Telecom, they
outbid several U.S., Australian and New Zealand rivals,
including a joint venture of Southwestern Bell Corp. and OTC
Ltd., an Australian long-distance telephone company; Cable &amp;
Wireless PLC, a giant British company that owns Hong Kong
Telecom, among other businesses; Brierley Investments Ltd., a
New Zealand investment firm with stakes in several U.S.
industrial companies; and Fletcher Challenge, a building
products and timber concern that is New Zealand's largest
company.
   Last year, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic bid together
unsuccessfully for a lucrative license to build and operate
West Germany's first private cellular-phone system. Their bid
came very close, and insiders say the bond of mutual
allegiance they forged during that experience endured. When
the New Zealand system was put on the auction block in March,
they quietly teamed up again.
   Both companies, like other regional Bells, have sought to
expand beyond their service territories. Both also have been
sitting on piles of cash. At the end of last year, Ameritech
had cash of $520.2 million; Bell Atlantic had $164.2 million.
   The Telecom auction was managed for the New Zealand
government by CS First Boston Group, a New York investment
banking firm, and the New Zealand firm of Buttle Wilson Ltd.
The sale process was substantially completed last night when
the agreement was approved by the New Zealand cabinet and
signed by company and government representatives.
   News of the award wasn't announced last night until about
10 p.m. New York time. In composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech shares closed at $65, down
25 cents; Bell Atlantic closed at $52.375, also down 25
cents.
   New Zealand decided to sell Telecom Corp. as part of an
asset-sale program to raise funds to repay debt. The
government will keep a special-rights preference share,
locally nicknamed the "Kiwi share," that will enable it to
influence Telecom's future ownership structure and ensure
that the new owners don't cut telephone service or raise
prices by more than the country's inflation rate.
   Earlier this year, New Zealand decided to open up the
telecommunications market to competition. Already a group of
companies including MCI Communications Corp. and Bell Canada
Enterprises Inc. have announced plans to merge their New
Zealand telecommunications ventures to position themselves
better to compete against the nation's telephone giant.
   Telecom, with 16,500 employees, 1.1 million customers and
about 1.4 million access lines, represents an attractive
prize. Revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31 was about
$1.3 billion. Profits, supressed somewhat by recent heavy
spending to improve the network, totaled about $148 million.
The company expects its network to be 90% digital by the end
of this year.
   For cautious Chicago-based Ameritech, the least
diversified of the seven Bell companies, the New Zealand move
is a particularly bold one. Almost all of Ameritech's 1989
revenue of $10.21 billion came from its five Bell operating
companies, directory publishing and cellular operations. But
more recently, Ameritech has expressed determination to push
in new directions rather than risk falling behind its
siblings and other rivals.
   In April, for example, William Weiss, Ameritech's
chairman, told shareholders that his management would "search
throughout the world" for the right expansion opportunities.
   Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic could find different
advantages in the venture. For instance, operating in New
Zealand will help the company supplement efforts to provide
premium-priced, high-margin services in the U.S. So far, its
overseas diversification has concentrated on such
customer-based offerings as computer maintenance, software
and systems integration.
   At Bell Atlantic's annual meeting in April, Raymond Smith,
chairman, said the company was looking at a wide range of
overseas investments, from cellular and network businesses to
systems integration. "It's a whole new world," he said, "full
of promise and opportunity."
   While the long-term rewards could be considerable, the
risks in New Zealand may be somewhat tougher on Bell Atlantic
than its partner. Bell Atlantic already has significantly
more long-term debt than Ameritech, about $7.7 billion
compared with $5.1 billion, and its debt as a portion of
total capital is 10 percentage points higher at 52.4%.
   Despite the extra obstacles of operating overseas, the
Bells have been eager to expand abroad because the consent
decree that broke up the Bell System in 1984 restricts their
business activities in the U.S. Under the decree, the
companies can't provide the content of electronic information
services.
   They are forbidden to manufacture telecommunications
equipment or offer long-distance services. Indeed, the
long-distance constraint has complicated the prospects for
participation by the Bells in a number of privatization
programs abroad, including New Zealand, Mexico and Puerto
Rico.
   The sale is scheduled to close in mid-September. Before
buying Telecom, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech must obtain a
waiver of the consent decree for operating certain
long-distance telephone services such as the service between
the U.S. and New Zealand that Telecom currently controls.
   The price paid by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech is to be
split evenly between the two companies. A total of 1.86
billion New Zealand dollars will be paid in six equal monthly
payments, beginning at the closing of the acquisition; a
single payment of about $1.38 billion will be made at the
closing.
   The Telecom sale will be the largest commercial
transaction in the history of New Zealand. The price is
higher than that received by the British government in its
1985 privatization of British Telecom.
