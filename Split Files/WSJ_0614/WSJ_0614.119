   Girard Partners L.P., controlled by investor David H.
Batchelder, said it entered into a confidentiality agreement
with Pic 'N' Save Corp.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Girard said it signed the pact in order to receive nonpublic
information needed to form an acquisition proposal for Pic
'N' Save.

   Pic 'N' Save and Girard, which have been at loggerheads
over efforts by Girard to oust Pic 'N' Save's board, recently
agreed to a truce while Pic 'N' Save management conducts an
auction to sell the company.
   Based in Dominguez, Calif., Pic 'N' Save operates a chain
of retail stores that specialize in close-out merchandise.
