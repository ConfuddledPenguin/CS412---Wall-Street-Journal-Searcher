   AUSTIN, Texas -- A federal judge ordered Richard Homer
Taylor, the former president of National Bank of Texas to
serve 12 years in prison, the maximum sentence, for
committing fraud that contributed to the Austin bank's
demise.
   Judge James Nowlin of the U.S. district court here also
ordered Mr. Taylor to pay $19,099 in restitution to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; to pay $505,000 in other
fines; and to make restitution of $221,000 to Franklin
Federal Bancorp of Austin, the receiver for a defunct thrift
that had losses from loans to Mr. Taylor.

   In January, Mr. Taylor pleaded guilty to two counts of
bank fraud and one count of income-tax fraud stemming from a
scheme in which other individuals obtained loans at his
direction and later transferred the loan proceeds to him.
