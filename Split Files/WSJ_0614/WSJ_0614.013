   EAST BERLIN -- The bittersweet scent of cocoa beans has
almost vanished from the work stations inside the grimy
redbrick buildings of East Berlin's only chocolate factory.
   Elfe VEB, owner of the factory, has all but stopped making
chocolate and wafers since April. "Our production is almost
nil, and the workers are deeply depressed," says Claudia
Sebastian, the plant's sales and marketing director. "People
here just aren't buying our chocolates. The quality is bad,
and the packaging unattractive. We never had the capital to
invest before, and now we don't have the financing to
compete."

   Reunification may be a German dream come true, but it is
giving Mrs. Sebastian nightmares. Elfe, nationalized in 1949,
can't find foreign partners for new investment partly because
its former owners, a family now living in West Berlin, are
trying to regain control of the company. If Elfe goes
bankrupt, Mrs. Sebastian fears that her economics degree will
be worthless on the job market. She got the degree five years
ago through an economics correspondence course that grounded
her in such subjects as Scientific Marxism and Plan
Fulfillment.
   "I came home from the factory and then worked every night
-- sometimes all night during test weeks -- for five years,"
says the 34-year-old Mrs. Sebastian, one of the rare women in
male-dominated East Germany to reach a senior management
position at so young an age. "But if this company closes, I
will be regarded by the unemployment office as an unqualified
worker with a high-school diploma -- nothing more."
   The popular uprising that began East Germany's revolution
has given way to such individual panic. The politics of
German unification, now consuming the four powers in their
talks with the two Germanys, interests few people here
anymore. The specter of capitalism does. From elderly
pensioners to youngsters fresh on the job market, they now
are instead obsessed with more personal and pressing matters
of adjusting to a society for which few have been prepared.
Psychiatrists report new tensions in marriages and more
divorces, crime has quintupled in East Berlin, and previously
unknown gang violence by neo-fascist groups is a frequent
occurrence.
   In May, a conservative victory in the country's first free
elections since the 1930s confirmed the desire of East
Germans for drastic and capitalist change. But the electoral
euphoria has been chilled by government estimates that
anywhere from 15% to 50% of all East German workers may be
unemployed during the transition to capitalism.
   Next month's monetary union will make every East German
jobholder a hard-currency earner -- but there are estimates
that at least seven in 10 East German companies will fold.
Executives of the country's largest car-maker, Ifa-Kombinat,
believe 100,000 of the 150,000 jobs in the auto industry are
endangered. The beer and soft-drink industries estimate that
80% of their jobs could be lost in an invasion by Becks, Coke
and Pepsi. Even those employees who seem likely to keep their
jobs fear that their hard-currency earnings will be too low
to buy much.
   "The question isn't anymore how much unemployment there
will be," says a senior Western diplomat here. "It will be
great. The question is the level of tolerance. How much will
East Germans endure before the situation grows socially
explosive?"
   "We were childish at first in our views about capitalism,"
Mrs. Sebastian at the chocolate factory says. "We thought
those who worked hard in capitalism would earn well and those
who worked little would earn little. But there's much more to
it than that. It was a very childish way of thinking."
   At the Elfe factory, Mrs. Sebastian watches workers trying
to adjust one of their inflexible machines to produce their
first, small Western order. It's a mere packaging order --
the chocolates and even the wrapping have been produced
elsewhere. The West German manufacturer doesn't mention the
East German plant on the label for fear of putting off
customers.
   Two hours south of East Berlin in Dresden, electrical
engineer Herbert Lappe suggests that East Germans are only
now discovering that they are paying the price for their
country's defeat in two wars -- World War II and the Cold
War. "To the victors go the spoils," he frowns, mourning that
West German companies are the winners and "most of us" are
the losers.
   Mr. Lappe has watched the value of his assets disappear.
   Last year, he bought a Commodore personal computer on the
gray market for 23,000 marks, around $13,800 at current
exchange rates, about five times its worth. He knew that
keeping up with Western technology was vital to his future,
and he expected to resell the computer at the same price a
few years later on a market starved for such products. But
its worth fell as quickly as the Berlin Wall, and now he can
get only 1,500 marks, or about $900, for the outmoded
machine.
   His Wartburg car, which he bought for 15,000 marks, once
could be sold five years old for about the same price. He'll
now be lucky to get 3,000 marks for it.
   The mathematics of unification is a painful science for
Mr. Lappe. He now pays eight pfennigs, or about five cents,
per kilowatt hour for electricity, compared to the 31
pfennigs, or about 19 cents, that it costs consumers in West
Germany. He rents his elegant apartment furnished with family
antiques for only 75 marks, or $45, a month. The owners, who
live on the ground floor, were forced by the state to rent
the flat at a price below their own costs of maintenance. But
free to charge a market rent, they will have a small gold
mine, and Mr. Lappe fears they'll either throw him out or
triple his rent.
   "And all of this happens under circumstances when you
don't know if your company will survive," he says. Still, he
is happy that he stands to keep his job at ERW-Elektronik
Dresden. About 1,800 fellow workers will be let go in the
uncertain fight for survival.
   "Some sort of normality will return after a few years, but
the problem is the transitional period," Mr. Lappe says. "We
have lost our old system of values, however flawed it might
have been, but we don't have a new system of values. Everyone
is only thinking of himself at the moment. We have lost the
dream of building any new society, and now we only want to
survive."
   Across town at a state dental clinic, Christa Keller is
one of those, like auto mechanics, carpenters and nurses,
whom popular wisdom considers lucky. As a trained dental
assistant, she has a talent that any society needs. She could
be expected to earn far more when the market sets her wages.
But her boss, a 55-year-old dentist, isn't sure he'll be able
to afford to keep her on. She isn't even sure that he can get
a loan to finance his practice when it becomes private.
   "He simply isn't creditworthy," she says. "Why should
banks, which have so many demands to extend financing, give
any money to a dentist who may have only five more years of
work in him -- 10 at the most? And why should a young dentist
hire a 50-year-old dental assistant like me?"
   Instead of complaining, Mrs. Keller is planning. She makes
delicious sandwiches and salads, and she intends to start a
catering service for business firms. And she is curious about
the possibility of opening American-style fast-food
restaurants in Dresden.
   She also sees that the threat of capitalism "is making
East Germans healthier." Doctors at the clinic aren't as busy
anymore. Workers once took many days off for sicknesses both
real and imagined. Now they are more likely to remain on the
job, trying to show their bosses that they should be the last
to be let go.
   At the dental office, patients once sought apppointments
that were timed to free them from the bulk of the workday,
but now most will come only at the end of the afternoon.
"Uncertainty has its good side, I suppose," says the dental
assistant. "Everyone wants to make a good impression. People
are dressing better, working harder and thinking more. Life
has become more hectic."
   But insecurity, capitalism's ugly brother, has intruded
into the senior citizens' complex on Dresden's
Comeniusstrasse 68 and, like an unwelcome guest, refuses to
leave.
   The twin towers there, reaching a gray 16 floors into a
gray sky, were intended to be an old folks' Utopia. Inhabited
mainly by former Communist Party and government officials,
the towers have a subsidized restaurant, a medical clinic, a
laundry and a social hall, where the elderly could happily
mix and exchange gossip. For their service to socialism many
of them have received the highest possible pension. For
medals and other state honors, they have received a monthly
bonus. Now they expect their incomes to shrink, and some are
bitter.
   "Of course we won't be paid by the new government for the
thousands of hours we spent building this country from
nothing," says a retired truck driver who was the party
secretary at his transportaton company. "We were Communist
because we weren't Fascist. It is an injustice that I must
now suffer for having been courageous enough to work for the
German future." Up until now, he says, his pension has been
double that of the doctor living across the hall.
   Yet Comeniusstrasse 68 was a failed Utopia, and other
residents are pleased by change. They had been suspicious of
each other, wondering which of them were government
informants. Now they chat amicably as they descend in the
elevators for the midday mail, a common daily pilgrimmage.
The local party organization has replaced the building's
party secretary, who always was thought to be asking too many
questions. And the residents' association in January pushed
through a vote to buy a satellite dish for Western
television, an effort that had failed dismally while the
party faithful still controlled the complex.
   Rapid turnover, a natural phenomenon in an old folks'
community, is now producing a more representative mix of
residents. While 75-year-old Helmut Fischer furiously pushes
the buttons of his remote control, curiously watching the
rock video channel, he smiles. "The party once had 90% of the
apartments," he says, "but now it is 70% and falling."
   Yet change at the top tier of government has been far too
rapid to be matched elsewhere in society. In East Berlin, an
economist is complaining as he watches East German television
reports from a European Community meeting in Ireland. "You
see that face," he says, pointing to the East German
correspondent on the screen. "He is a `Genosse'" -- a party
comrade. "He studied in Moscow and was a party member, and
now he talks proudly of how we will be members of the
European Community."
   The economist asks not to be quoted by name because, he
says, his company is still run by those who were appointed by
the country's former leadership. "I was hoping that in the
excitement of the moment, the younger managers would rise up
and have them removed, but instead they have quietly stayed
in the wings and merely waited for change instead of trying
to cause it," he says. Yet he concedes that he is one of the
"cowards."
   East Germans are also disappointed that Western companies
haven't been much interested in forming joint ventures and
building new plants, thus providing investment to compete.
Instead, many appear more interested in simply selling their
own goods here. Instead of creating thousands of jobs, most
only want to hire some sales representatives.
   Ironically, the former party faithful have fared best.
They know the East German bureaucracy, and they made
international contacts in trips abroad. A new elite isn't
created overnight.
   "I see them driving around in their new Mercedeses and it
makes me sick," says Mrs. Sebastian, who has already laid off
80 of her 450 chocolate-factory employees. "The same people
who misguided our economy are now those representing Western
companies and getting rich. Couldn't Western companies look
more carefully for their partners? Where is the justice for
which we had all hoped?"
