   DALLAS -- Former Texas thrift owner Don R. Dixon, a key
figure in the influence-peddling scandal that helped topple
House Speaker Jim Wright, was indicted on charges that
include illegal political contributions.
   Mr. Dixon, who owned the now-defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan
Association, is also charged with directing the use of Vernon
funds to pay for junkets, including "female companionship,"
for thrift executives and the then-commissioner of the Texas
Savings and Loan Department.

   Mr. Dixon acquired Vernon in July 1982 and just two years
later was wrangling with federal thrift regulators who wanted
to limit the thrift's real-estate lending and explosive
growth. Mr. Dixon was among the Texas thrift operators who
sought the help of Mr. Wright and other congressmen, asking
them to intervene with the regulators.
   Ten of the 38 counts in the indictment, which was handed
up by a federal grand jury in Dallas, charge Mr. Dixon with
making false entries in Vernon's books to cover up
reimbursements to employees for their political
contributions.
   Among the politicians who received contributions from
Vernon employees, according to the indictment, were former
House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California; former U.S.
Rep. Jack Kemp, now secretary of the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development; and current U.S. Rep. Martin
Frost of Texas.
   Also receiving contributions from Vernon employees was Mr.
Wright, who resigned his congressional seat just over a year
ago after a lengthy inquiry into his personal and campaign
finances.
   The U.S. Justice Department said in a statement that the
politicians weren't aware of the improper campaign
contributions, and "there is no evidence that illegal or
improper activity was engaged in by the receiving individuals
or campaigns."
   The former Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner, L. Linton
Bowman III, who isn't accused of wrongdoing, declined to
comment on the charges that Mr. Dixon used thrift funds to
pay the commissioner's way on trips to San Diego, San
Francisco and Kansas.
   The indictment caps a 3 1/2-year investigation by the
Justice Department, which has been criticized in Congress for
its slowness in bringing criminal charges against the people
believed most responsible for the multibillion-dollar losses
in Texas thrifts.
   In apparent response to that criticism, U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh released a statement with Mr. Dixon's
indictment lauding "the hard work of our tough, persistent
investigators and prosecutors."
   "These complicated, white-collar crime cases take time to
develop, but the Justice Department is committed to the
investigation, prosecution and incarceration of those who
ripped off our financial institutions and have left the
taxpayers of the United States holding the bag," Mr.
Thornburgh said in the statement.
   When Vernon was taken over by federal thrift regulators in
1987, as much as 96% of its $1.2 billion-plus loan portfolio
was in default. The institution had wracked up millions of
dollars in losses through loans for speculative real estate
developments, many of them to friends of Mr. Dixon and other
Texas thrift owners.
   But the indictment against Mr. Dixon is only tangentially
related to the massive, fraudulent loans that helped bring
about Vernon's demise. Instead, prosecutors focused on the
sorts of charges that are comparatively easy for juries to
understand: illegal reimbursements for campaign contributions
and junkets and the diversion of loan proceeds to pay for Mr.
Dixon's California beach home.
   Prosecutors have used similar charges to win convictions
against some of Vernon's former top officers, including the
thrift's ex-president, Pat G. King.
   Because juries have shown a willingness to convict on such
charges in the past, Mr. Dixon's attorney, William M.
Ravkind, said the charges against his client will be
difficult to defend against. "I don't know how we're going to
win this one," Mr. Ravkind said.
   Mr. Dixon, if convicted of all the charges, would face a
maximum sentence of 190 years in federal prison and a fine of
as much as $9.5 million. Mr. Dixon is scheduled to surrender
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation today, and a date for
his first court appearance will be set at that time.
