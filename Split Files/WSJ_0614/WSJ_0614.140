   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., New York, said it
received a $5 million order from a Chinese electronics
supplier to provide sophisticated telephone equipment for the
Chinese army.
   The agreement to ship digital telephone exchanges to China
Electronic System Equipment Corp. is awaiting U.S. Government
approval. But an AT&amp;T spokesman said the company is confident
it will get clearance, as the order is an extension of a
contract signed in 1985, and the Bush administration recently
renewed Beijing's status as a most-favored trading partner.

   The spokesman also said AT&amp;T received permission from the
U.S. and its 16 Western allies to ship transmission equipment
to a joint venture that it set up with Chinese partners in
May 1989. He said AT&amp;T had been awaiting approval for a year
from the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export
Controls. The venture, AT&amp;T Shanghai Ltd., is owned by
Dutch-based AT&amp;T Network Systems International and by
Shanghai Telecommunications Equipment Factory and Shanghai
Optical Fiber Communications Engineering Corp.
