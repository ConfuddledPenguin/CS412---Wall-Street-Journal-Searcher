   Schering AG said that the West German mark's strength
relative to other currencies continues to undermine the
company's sales and earnings, and that in the first five
months of this year, world-wide group sales rose just 3% from
a year earlier.
   The West German pharmaceutical and chemical company didn't
disclose five-month sales figures. But it said a soft growth
trend probably will continue through the year. It didn't
estimate five-month profit.

   Chairman Giuseppi Vita reiterated at the annual meeting
that the company still expects sales for 1990 to rise about
5% from a year earlier, and earnings at about the same
levels, because of higher operating costs and the mark's
strength. Last year, Schering profit increased 43% to 225
million marks ($132.7 million), and global sales rose 11% to
5.85 billion marks.
   "For the near future, also for the current business year,
we expect a continued firm growth in sales in terms of
physical volumes," the chairman said.
