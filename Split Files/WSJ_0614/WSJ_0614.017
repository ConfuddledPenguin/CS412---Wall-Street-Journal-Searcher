   WASHINGTON -- Cocaine and crack use is straining the
nation's child welfare agencies with child-abuse and neglect
cases and contributing to an increase in the number of
children placed in foster care, according to a congressional
report.
   "Drug-exposed parents and children are placing growing
demands on the child welfare system," said the report
released yesterday by the Human Resources Subcommittee of the
House Ways and Means Committee. "The upsurge in crack use has
been blamed for the increase in the number of reported cases
of child abuse and neglect, the increased severity of child
abuse, and the number of children placed in out-of-home
care."

   The child welfare system is "so overloaded by crack
cocaine that it is about to short circuit," warned Rep.
Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), the subcommittee's acting chair. He
and Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.), who heads the Select
Committee on Children, Youth and Families, introduced
legislation to provide states more resources for prevention,
treatment and other services for drug-affected families.
   The report parallels growing concern over increasing
births of drug-exposed babies and their ability to cope in
school and beyond. It draws together wide-ranging information
about the effects of cocaine and its fiercely addictive
derivative, crack cocaine, on families and child welfare,
drug treatment and health-care systems.
   More than 100,000 cocaine-exposed babies were born in
1988, according to the report, a figure that could rise to
between 500,000 and four million in 10 years.
   Crack has been linked to an increase in the number of
abuse and neglect cases reported since the mid-1980s, when
the drug first emerged. The report said drug abuse is a
significant factor in more than 70% of the child welfare
cases in some agencies. It has become "the dominant
characteristic" in case loads of child protective-service
agencies in 22 states and the District of Columbia. One
survey cited in the report said 675,000 children a year are
seriously mistreated by an alcoholic or drug-abusive
caretaker.
   The shortage-plagued foster-care system is also feeling
the impact of drug-exposed babies and their often fragmented
families. Data cited in the report said foster-care
placements rose nationally by 29% to 360,000 in 1989 from
280,000 in 1986. Though no link can be conclusively drawn
between drug use and the rise in placements, the report said
increased placements are concentrated in areas heavily
affected by crack abuse, such as California and New York.
Those two states were responsible for 55% of the increase in
foster placements nationally.
   Despite these problems, there is a severe shortage of
drug-treatment programs for pregnant women. Just 16% of New
York City's drug-treatment programs, for instance, serve
pregnant women addicted to crack.
   The report also documents increased costs of health care
for cocaine-involved pregnancies, including abandoned or
"boarder" babies, and future effects on educational, mental
health and juvenile justice systems.
   Mr. Downey said legislation to address the problem would
cost $5 billion over five years. But "we will save many lives
and billions more than this bill costs" through early
intervention efforts, he said. "We believe this bill has the
same place that the budget summit has in the priorities of
this country."
