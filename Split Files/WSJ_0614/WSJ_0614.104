   The local teachers' union is suing to stop her, the local
NAACP is siding with the union, and both of Milwaukee's major
newspapers have editorialized against her. But Wisconsin
State Rep. Polly Williams says she's surprised at the
controversy stirred up by her experimental plan to let 1,000
low-income Milwaukee children use vouchers to attend a
private school of their choice. "You'd think I dropped a bomb
near the teachers' unions," she chuckles. "Well, maybe that
wouldn't be so bad."
   The teachers' unions have joined with officials of the
NAACP in a lawsuit challenging the Williams voucher plan.
They contend that the plan, under which students selected by
lottery are given up to $2,500 in tuition to attend a private
nonsectarian school, is unconstitutional. The crux of their
lawsuit is that the private schools involved "are designed to
operate as a type of surrogate Milwaukee public school but
without any state control over the type or quality of
instruction in exchange for those public funds."

   Lawyers for the unions' lawsuit also have written us
contending that our support for the Williams plan is at odds
with Brookings Institution scholar John Chubb's choice plan,
which he described on this page last week. Mr. Chubb would
convert education money into universal public "scholarships"
and let parents choose their own schools so long as they meet
minimum standards of safety, nondiscrimination and the like.
   We called up Mr. Chubb and asked if he agreed that the
Williams voucher plan lacked sufficient taxpayer
accountability. "That's a laughable position," he told us.
"Milwaukee officials have been holding their public schools
`accountable' for years with disastrous results. It's quite
comical to say that private schools whose diplomas are
recognized by state universities can't be held accountable by
the parents who send their kids there."
   If anything, it is the Milwaukee public schoolteachers who
are unaccountable to taxpayers. Even Milwaukee NAACP director
Felmers Chaney, a party in the lawsuit against the plan, has
raised this issue. Mr. Chaney opposes vouchers because, if
expanded, they could lead to wholesale flight from the
Milwaukee public schools. However, he points out that an
average of only two public schoolteachers are fired each
year. "There's more incompetent teachers out there than
that," he says. "We have to take the union to task. And we
may have to take to the streets."
   While the Milwaukee Sentinel and the Milwaukee Journal
have come out against her inner-city school reform, Polly
Williams does have some press support. Mikel Holt, editor of
the largest black newspaper in Wisconsin, says the Williams
choice plan "is the only way the public schools can be forced
to do a better job." His paper, the Milwaukee Community
Journal, has reported extensively on the private schools that
will start accepting vouchers in September.
   One school, the Harambee Community School, has been owned
by black parents since its founding in 1970. Some 98% of its
students graduate from high school and 89% go on to college.
Another, Urban Day School, uses donations to charge only $950
a year and cuts the tuition further if parents volunteer 20
hours of work. All of the half-dozen schools involved plan to
expand with the voucher students.
   Despite all this, opponents are trying to paint Mrs.
Williams as a tool of white private schools that want to
hijack money destined for the needy public schools; the
nearby Milwaukee Journal editorial cartoon is an example.
This attitude is at first glance puzzling. The $2,500 maximum
value of the voucher is less than half the cost of educating
a child in Milwaukee public schools. The schools shouldn't
lose any money overall for a child who transfers to a private
school. But Mr. Chubb points out that those transfers would
so expose the poor job the public schools are doing that
their entire budgets would be called into question. That is
the real threat that Mrs. Williams poses to the establishment
and its status quo.
   Of her mostly liberal opponents, Mrs. Williams says: "It
would be different if they worried more about their 42%
drop-out rate than they did about busing African-American
kids across town like pawns." She says, "My constituents want
a quality education and if public schools can provide it
that's fine. They just need some competition to get them
motivated."
   Mrs. Williams did pick up one political supporter last
Friday in Milwaukee. President George Bush was in town on
behalf of Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a Williams ally.
Mr. Bush called the Williams choice plan "one of the most
interesting experiments in education reform. I think we all
will see that when schools compete to attract students, that
can't help but raise the overall level of education."
