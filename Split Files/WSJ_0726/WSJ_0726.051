   STATIC AHEAD for electric utilities, consumers,
shareholders, analysts warn.
   Kansas City Power &amp; Light's hostile bid this week for
Kansas Gas &amp; Electric illuminates the state of the electric
power industry: Slapped down on full rate hikes, unable to
pursue nuclear options and worried about future capacity,
utilities consolidate in an attempt to improve profits. "This
is not a stodgy, `widow-and-orphan' industry anymore," says
Daniel Scotto, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, New
York.

   Consumers facing peak summer cooling bills may not realize
it, but investor-owned utility rate-hikes slid 12.5% last
year to $1.8 billion, says the Edison Electric Institute. The
industry still generally enjoys excess capacity, a major
reason for flat rates or smallish increases of late. But that
may change five years down the road, says Philip Giudice, of
Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane, Lexington, Mass. He says utilities
"have been able to live off cheap plant and investment"
thanks to a large asset base now near the end of its life.
   For the first time in 20 years, Baltimore G&amp;E and Potomac
Electric used rolling blackouts on one hot day.
                                                                                                       

   BEACHY BOOKS: Unusual best sellers, hot regional titles
fuel summer reading.
   A Danielle Steel book about Vietnam; the history of time
in paperback and the biography of a 19th century British
explorer surprise some booksellers by succeeding amid usually
frothy summer fare. Local books are big, too. Gloria Nagy's
"A House in the Hamptons" is a prime seller in East Hampton,
on Long Island. In San Francisco, a reissue of "Ringo Levio"
by '60s artist Emmett Grogan sells well at Booksmith.
   "It's an unreported phenomenon that in many areas of the
country there are books that touch the heartstrings of
locals," says Bill Rickman, president of Kroch's and
Brentano's, Chicago. He notes the Windy City's Sara Paretsky,
whose "Burn Marks" features a female private eye. Also a
local: Scott Turow, whose "The Burden of Proof" tops Chicago
and national best-seller lists. Book Hampton tells of
shoppers who simply want to stock the library, like the woman
who recently bought an armload to keep weekend guests amused.
Her literary requirements? "She wanted all hard covers,"
drawls the manager.
                                                                                                       

   BAILOUT FALLOUT: Bank statements bulge with deposit
insurance rule changes.
   Home mailboxes grow heavy with notices about new federal
deposit insurance rules that take hold next week. Regulators
admit most people won't be affected by the largely technical
changes, but banks and thrifts are required to notify all
depositors. Changes stem from last year's thrift bailout law
that eliminated the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
and mandated that rules for S&amp;Ls and for banks be reconciled
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The important thing remains the same: most deposits still
are insured up to $100,000. Individual, joint and trust
accounts are all insured separately. The changes do affect
some husband-and-wife trust accounts. Previously, the
couple's trust account at an S&amp;L naming each other as
beneficiaries could be insured up to $200,000. Now, such an
account is insured only up to $100,000. But the full $200,000
can still be insured if the couple splits it into two
separate accounts of $100,000, each naming the other
beneficiary.
   Account ownership is critical in determining insurance
coverage, says Claude Rollin, senior FDIC attorney.
                                                                                                       

   KIDS COME FIRST. NCNB Corp., a Charlotte, N.C. bank,
encourages its 30,000 employees to help schools by allowing
workers up to two hours' paid time a week for things such as
tutoring, coaching, or PTA activity.
                                                                                                       

   PEARLY GATE LEG-UP? American Express's Ayco unit offers a
program that will donate $1 million to a director's favored
charity on his demise. "The director can, in effect, take
credit before he's dead," a spokesman says.
                                                                                                       

   NO-CRUNCH CREDIT: The total number of credit cards in the
U.S. topped one billion in June, says the Nilson Report.
Consumers currently use plastic to pay for $28 out of every
$100 spent on consumable goods and services, it adds.
                                                                                                       

   THE PAY'S THE THING on Broadway as musicals tap dance over
serious plays.
   Tickets to the most popular shows like "The Phantom of the
Opera" and "Les Miserables" are $60 -- when they're
available. When they're not, "ticket brokers" command as much
as $200 for an orchestra seat. Even "scalpers," who hawk
tickets outside theaters, charge less. Heavy prices for light
entertainment give rise to a counter-move. A plan from the
Broadway Alliance would help production of non-musicals.
Tickets would be $10 to $24.
   For now, a family of three could easily pay over $200 for
tickets to a show plus a bite to eat. For that price, they
want the kind of spectacle that makes theater just another
tourist attraction, some say. "Come to New York, see the
Empire State Building, the U.N., and `Cats,'" laments
Benjamin Mordecai, producer of "The Piano Lesson." But try
the discount booths first; it could mean big savings on
available tickets.
   Average weekly gross for: "Gypsy," $500,000; "Grand
Hotel," $450,000; "The Piano Lesson," $175,000-$190,000.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The first Braille football card from High-Pro
Marketing features former L.A. Raider Jim Plunkett, a child
