   Part of the appeal of Scott Turow's best-selling novel,
"Presumed Innocent," was the challenging thicket of plot the
book presented to the hardy reader. Mr. Turow's teasing,
withholding narrator coyly opened up paths that drew his
audience deeper and deeper into a complex puzzle of
interlocking plots. Though the subject was murder, the book
was about political corruption, lust, infidelity, kinky
sexual proclivities and most other expressions of the moral
disintegration that inevitably surrounds icy blondes with
trim behinds in certain kinds of fiction.
   What gave Mr. Turow's work extra weight was the authentic
tone of weary cynicism he acquired in his years as a
real-life prosecutor. That knowledgeable voice was powerful
enough to lure even an unwilling reader through endless
twists and turns, right up to the final twist, the one that
felt a bit like a cheat.

   The movie version of "Presumed Innocent" dutifully tries
to duplicate the maze of plot without strong visual
dramatization or benefit of the guiding narrative voice.
(It's no accident, though it's an indication of some major
failing, that the movie's most engaged moments come at the
beginning and the end, with the sound of the main character's
voice speaking to an empty jury box.)
   The film makers decided that the only way to condense the
mass of information was through endless exposition. So, in
scene after scene, characters talk and talk. They talk
sitting behind desks, they talk going up and down elevators,
they talk walking through hallways.
   All this conversation takes place in the darkness favored
by cinematographer Gordon Willis. Monotonous as it becomes,
the darkness does match the tone of the material and the
seriousness of purpose that director Alan Pakula obviously
has brought to the subject. Yet for all the discussion of
evil there is little dramatization of it, and so a hot
subject has been cooled down. Still, the facts themselves
contain enough interest to keep eyes on the screen, even
though with this movie there's far more to hear than to see.
   Harrison Ford plays Rusty Sabich, the chief assistant
district attorney put in charge of the murder investigation
of a colleague, a woman who specialized in prosecuting sex
offenders. Her own murder was both brutal and overtly sexual.
The timing was inopportune for her boss, an ambitious
district attorney in the middle of a hotly contested election
campaign. Raymond, the district attorney, wants the case
dispatched quickly, so he turns to his ace assistant, Rusty.
   Rusty, who is married and has a young son, tries to beg
off but can't because he can't tell the boss the real reason
for his reluctance: that he and Carolyn were lovers. His
worst fears are soon confirmed as the evidence starts
implicating him. Soon he becomes both pursuer and pursued.
There is great appeal in this particular turn, which sets
into motion a great many machinations, both internal and
external, as Rusty tries to solve his case, or to appear to
be solving his case.
   In the book, Rusty told the story. The disadvantage of
this device was that, in the end, much of the story felt
disingenuous; one discovered the narrator hadn't always been
on the up and up with the reader. The film makers have
"solved" the problem by altering the ending and by either
imposing or permitting their Rusty to appear almost
impenetrably stolid.
   Mr. Ford, who has shown himself capable of range beyond
Indiana Jones, looks constipated for most of the movie. In a
way that's exactly the problem, since his character is
required to hold so much in. The Rusty we see is a family
man, with a somewhat oppressively cute child and a pretty,
nervous wife, Barbara, who reminds him frequently that she
has set aside her own intellectual pursuits for her family.
As played by the lovely Bonnie Bedelia, Barbara seems
self-pitying, vulnerable and, eventually, demented. But even
Ms. Bedelia can't make her a whole person, because Mr. Turow
didn't write her that way to begin with.
   Indeed, women are never presumed to be innocent in either
the book or the movie. Carolyn, introduced entirely through
flashbacks, is repeatedly referred to as smart, but her
brains aren't what she is remembered for. It's her beauty,
her coldness, her manipulativeness, her ambition. There is an
unspoken idea that maybe Carolyn deserved to be murdered,
even brutally, even though she seems to have directed her
ambition and manipulativeness toward doing her job (hardly a
terrible thing when you think about it, using everything she
had to put away rapists and child abusers). The movie Carolyn
offers only a hint of what it was that made so many men so
obsessed with her. When Rusty first recalls her, the film
makers flash the image of Greta Scacchi, who plays her, on
the screen. This vision, cold and beautiful though it may be,
has the passion of a bulletin-board advertisement for suntan
lotion. Like Barbara, she is unknowable.
   The men are more varied and more numerous as they play out
the movie's sprawling huggermugger. Raul Julia does a bizarre
turn as Sandy Stern, Rusty's Argentine Jewish defense
attorney and the main character in Mr. Turow's current best
seller, "The Burden of Proof." He looks a bit like Raymond
Burr in his Perry Mason days. Brian Dennehy brings his usual
heft, both physical and dramatic to the part of Raymond, the
pragmatic district attorney whose loyalties lie only with the
game. "Presumed Innocent" will appeal most to those who like
to figure out the game, no matter how it's played.

   VIDEO TIP: Harrison Ford may be best known as a
swashbuckling action hero in the "Star Wars" and "Indiana
Jones" movie series. Nothing wrong with what he does there,
but he reached deeper levels in "Witness," Peter Weir's
bittersweet romance of a cop who finds love among the Amish.
He's also fine in Roman Polanski's "Frantic," a flawed yet
engaging thriller.
