   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. apparently lost the
chairman's board seat and two others to dissident shareholder
Centaur Partners Group, which claimed it won a mandate for
its plan to liquidate the company.
   But Centaur would have only a minority voice on the
10-person board, and must convince directors, particularly
independent members, to go along. Although the final vote
won't be known until Aug. 9, Centaur is believed to have
received at least two-thirds of the votes.

   Centaur, which owns 16.5% of National Intergroup, said it
wouldn't rush into a fire sale of FoxMeyer Drug, the
wholesale-drug distribution operation and essentially
National Intergroup's only ongoing business. Still, "we think
it's in the best interest to pursue a potential sale of
FoxMeyer in a responsible way," said Melvyn J. Estrin, a
principal of Centaur, who was elected to the board. "We think
the shareholder vote is a mandate."
   Management has argued that an immediate sale wouldn't
capture the potential value for FoxMeyer, which has lagged
its competitors but is improving. Indeed, FoxMeyer's sales
rose 23% and operating earnings surged 40% in the first
quarter ended June 30.
   Still, Mr. Estrin estimated that FoxMeyer, with its 11
distribution centers, could fetch between $475 million and
$525 million, or at least $21 a share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
National Intergroup common stock closed unchanged at $18 a
share.
   Centaur's apparent win likely marks the end of an
embattled tenure for Howard M. Love, the company's chairman
and chief executive officer, who helped steer the company
from steel and aluminum into retail, oil, financial services
and ultimately wholesale-drug distribution. Up until now, Mr.
Love has managed to fend off dissatisfied shareholders,
frustrated with seven consecutive years of operating losses;
he even won an earlier proxy fight in the mid-1980s.
   Still, he conceded the grand plan of becoming a drug
wholesaler has taken "far longer than I had anticipated."
Although disappointed in the vote, he said he hopes the
company continues to operate FoxMeyer "without a lot of
bickering on the board."
   He wouldn't say whether he would step down as chief
executive before his planned retirement in March. However, he
will likely have to relinquish his title as chairman.
   Yesterday's shareholder meeting culminates a proxy fight
that included several lawsuits and seven months of litigation
challenging the company's anti-takeover "poison pill" plan
and bylaws regarding board size. In that time, the company
announced a major restructuring that called for the sale of
its Ben Franklin general merchandise franchise chain and
Permian Partners L.P. oil operation, with proceeds going
towards a special dividend and share buy-back program. The
plan, which the company had hoped would console impatient
investors, also called for Mr. Love's retirement next spring.
   But the plan failed to impress shareholders, who noted
that they haven't been paid a dividend since the fourth
quarter of 1988. Meanwhile Mr. Love received a $300,000 bonus
in 1990 and options to buy 325,000 shares at $16.80 each.
   "You ask for support against Centaur. Do you deserve it?"
asked Eugene Cohen at the meeting; Mr. Cohen owns more stock
than any director besides Mr. Love. National Intergroup
directors own less than 1% of the company's stock
outstanding.
   The two other Centaur-nominated directors are Robert J.
Slater, former vice chairman of Crane Co. and William G.
Tull, former president of American Security Bank.
   Separately, National Intergroup said that as a result of
the closing of its Pittsburgh headquarters and the sale of
its Ben Franklin and Permian units, it would "incur
significant losses which will negatively impact first-quarter
results." The company declined to say whether it would post a
net loss. In last year's first quarter ended June 30,
National Intergroup earned $13 million, or 53 cents a share,
on revenue of $853.5 million.
