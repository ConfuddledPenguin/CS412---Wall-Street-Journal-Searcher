   Donald C. Carter, a once-highflying proxy solicitor, was
sentenced to 16 months to four years in prison and was
ordered to pay $1 million in restitution after his guilty
plea to charges of grand larceny and personal income-tax
evasion.
   In a New York state court, Justice George Roberts also
fined Mr. Carter $50,000. In an investigation, the state
Organized Crime Task Force found that Mr. Carter, former head
of Carter Organization, had overcharged or falsely billed
clients.

   "The sentence was pursuant to a plea bargain, wherein this
was the maximum possible sentence," said John J. Tigue Jr.,
Mr. Carter's attorney at Kostelanetz Ritholz Tigue &amp; Fink.
"We had earnestly hoped for a lesser sentence and are
obviously disappointed." Mr. Carter will have to serve at
least the minimum of 16 months.
   The fine will be appealed, Mr. Tigue said, but the $1
million restitution has been remitted to the Task Force for
distribution.
   In 1987, Mr. Carter sold his firm for more than $75
million to Britain's VPI Group PLC, which in June renamed it
Quorum Communications Inc. Proxy-solicitation firms solicit
and collect shareholder votes on behalf of corporations.
Yesterday, Quorum announced a separate settlement with the
task force.
   Under the terms, Quorum will retain an auditing firm that
for at least six months will review its business practices
and ensure that clients' restitution claims are handled
properly. In turn, the task force agreed not to bring any
civil or criminal charges against Quorum or its parent.
   Quorum also agreed to pay the state $1 million -- separate
from the restitution payment made by Mr. Carter -- from any
funds it might receive from a civil suit VPI filed against
Mr. Carter in May.
   The civil action, filed in federal court in Manhattan,
accused Mr. Carter, 41 years old, of racketeering, fraud and
breach of contract.
   At the Manhattan law firm Gold &amp; Wachtel, which is
handling the civil action for Mr. Carter, attorney Robert
Gold said Mr. Carter has made a motion to have the suit heard
in state court rather than federal court. VPI's attorneys are
to answer the motion late in August or early in September.
Judge Thomas Griesa is hearing the case.

   REVIEW OF JUDGE SOUTER'S record by the ABA will have new
twists.
   At the request of the Justice Department, the review
already has begun by the 15-member American Bar Association
Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which will vote
to find the Supreme Court nominee either well-qualified,
qualified or not qualified.
   In the past, the ABA panel has solicited analyses of a
nominee's published work from two randomly chosen law-school
faculties and from the lawyers at the Standing Committee
chairman's own law firm.
   But the current chairman, Ralph Lancaster of Portland,
Maine, has added a new twist. In addition to two law-school
faculties -- Stanford and Northwestern are already at work on
Judge Souter -- he has formed an 11-person permanent "reading
committee" of prominent lawyers to digest the nominee's court
opinions and report back.
   The committee, which also has begun working on Judge David
Souter's decisions, is headed by Rex Lee, solicitor-general
in the Reagan administration and now president of Brigham
Young University.
   Among other members are University of Texas law professor
Charles Alan Wright, former federal appeals court Judges
Philip Tone of Chicago and Arlin Adams of Philadelphia,
Philip Lacovara, a top in-house lawyer of General Electric
Co. who will soon move to Morgan Stanley, and Drew Days, a
Yale Law School professor who was Justice Department
civil-rights chief in the Carter administration.
   Mr. Lancaster said the new reading committee was created
to avoid any suggestions of bias on the part of any
individual law firm. "I thought it best to put an independent
group" in place, he said.
   There is another twist, as well. Among members of the ABA
Standing Committee that will vote on Judge Souter's
nomination is William J. Brennan III, a Princeton, N.J.,
lawyer and son of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. whose
retirement created the Supreme Court vacancy.

   FORMER HOUSING OFFICIALS in New Jersey admit to lying to
Congress.
   Two former officials of a HUD-sponsored housing agency in
Passaic, N.J., pleaded guilty to one count each of lying to
Congress and conspiracy to conceal a fraud and kickback
scheme and to evade tax payments.
   Paul A. Marguglio, executive director of the Passaic
Housing Authority for 20 years, and August C. Michaelis,
former attorney for the agency, both entered guilty pleas
before federal Judge Maryanne Trump Barry in Newark.
   Each former official faces a maximum of 10 years in prison
and a fine of as much as $50,000.
   As part of the plea-bargain agreement, Messrs. Marguglio
and Michaelis will cooperate with the House Governmental
Operations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing in
Washington that is investigating allegations of widespread
corruption within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The Passaic agency was under contract with HUD
to provide low-income housing.
   A HUD audit report released early this year outlined
evidence showing that almost $1 million in impermissible
expenses were pocketed by Passaic agency officials. Mr.
Marguglio admitted that he conspired with others at the
agency to prevent HUD from uncovering a scheme that allowed
him to earn $125,000 more than his annual salary of $84,000
in 1989 by illegally holding three other agency jobs.
   Mr. Marguglio also pocketed $150,000 in kickbacks paid to
him by Mr. Michaelis so that he could keep his job as agency
counsel. Later, Messrs. Marguglio and Michaelis conspired to
hide the scheme and lied to the House subcommittee about it
in March.
   Messrs. Marguglio and Michaelis are scheduled for
sentencing Oct. 4. Three other Passaic housing officials
previously pleaded guilty to their roles in the kickback
scheme.
   "Today's pleas and the earlier convictions underscore the
fact that corruption and fraud in HUD housing authorities
have been both extensive and pervasive," said Michael
Chertoff, U.S. attorney in Newark.

26-lawyer Houston branch.
