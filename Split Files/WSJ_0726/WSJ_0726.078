   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Eastern Airlines
and nine current and former management employees on charges
of failing to perform mandatory maintenance on Eastern
aircraft and falsifying related records.
   In announcing the indictment, U.S. District Attorney
Andrew J. Maloney alleged that the scheme was directed from
Eastern's Miami headquarters and arose as the result of
pressure by upper management to avoid costly flight delays
and cancellations.

   According to the indictment, some employees allegedly
engaged in "pencil whipping," or signing off on work that
wasn't performed, at Eastern's maintenance bases at John F.
Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport in New
York and Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. Eastern
last year paid a $1.9 million civil penalty related to
similar charges after an investigation by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The 60-count indictment is unprecedented in commercial
aviation, and Mr. Maloney said at a news conference that he
sees the case as an example to the entire airline industry.
"If this is occurring at other airlines, they can expect a
lot of trouble," he said.
   In a statement released from its Miami headquarters,
Eastern reiterated that it has been extensively examined in
the past on such matters and has taken action to correct the
alleged abuses. "There is no question that Eastern is safe,"
the statement said.
   Eastern said Tuesday that plea bargain talks with
prosecutors had collapsed because it wouldn't accept a
broad-based conspiracy charge. Eastern said it had been
prepared to plead guilty to some charges of falsifying
records.
   The indictment alleges that in Atlanta, Eastern personnel
installed defective or untested electronic parts, including
cockpit instruments and other critical navigation equipment.
At all three airports, the indictment says, maintenance
personnel failed to perform repairs that would have delayed
aircraft, and then doctored records to indicate the work had
been completed.
   The defendants are also charged with conspiracy, wire
fraud and obstructing justice for giving false testimony
about the alleged plan at a Federal Aviation Administration
hearing.
   Named as defendants along with Eastern are Edward Upton,
until January a vice president, maintenance and engineering,
in Miami; Thomas Lewis, maintenance director of Eastern's
northern region airports, in Montreal, Washington and Boston;
and seven other supervisors. Mr. Upton couldn't be reached
for comment, and Eastern declined to comment on Mr. Lewis's
behalf.
   A spokeswoman for Eastern said the seven employees still
with the airline have been reassigned to non-maintenance
positions. But Mr. Maloney asserted that "up to a few days
ago, half of the managers charged were still on the payroll
and involved in maintenance."
   The Eastern spokeswoman said that effective yesterday the
seven were put on paid administrative leave and that Eastern
will pay their legal bills "as long as we are confident of
their innocence."
   If convicted on all counts, Eastern faces a maximum fine
of $30 million. Each individual defendant faces up to five
years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count.
Mr. Maloney said that an indictment is expected to be filed
against another Eastern employee shortly.
