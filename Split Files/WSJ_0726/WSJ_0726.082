   Your running coverage of state Rep. Polly Williams's
Milwaukee voucher program and John E. Chubb's iconoclastic
new book, "Politics, Markets, and America's Schools," shows
that parental choice in education is where we have an
exciting confluence of the values of equity and sound
economics. Paul A. Gigot is right (Potomac Watch, June 8):
"When Brookings and the Heritage Foundation agree, the debate
on substance is over." What business does with the choice
issue will be the litmus test of its commitment to the market
principles it professes.
   In a 1989 national Gallup Poll, 60% of all respondents and
67% of non-white respondents favored allowing students and
their parents to choose their public schools, regardless of
where they live. Two recent Minnesota surveys had similar
results.

   A 1985 study found that 69% of parents with children in
Chicago's public schools would enroll their children in
private schools if they could afford it. Newspaper reports
reveal that many Chicago political, civic and educational
leaders -- minority and majority leaders alike -- send their
children to private schools. And, most telling, 46% of the
children of Chicago's public-school teachers who live in the
city attend private schools, compared with 22% of all
school-age children in Chicago.
   Obviously, many of those with the ability to pay both
taxes and private-school tuition exercise their option with
no guilt about having abandoned the public-school system,
though some of them will not hesitate to use this
self-serving "abandonment" argument to deny the same option
to the 70% of poverty-level parents whose children constitute
a $2.3 billion captive market for Chicago public education.
   Many who would deny choice to the poor are proponents of
"parental empowerment" and "equity." This double standard is
cynical, condescending and insulting, ultimately disabling,
paternalism.
   At last, Chicago business leaders are realizing that we've
been overlooking a success story right under our noses: the
448 private elementary and secondary schools (religious,
independent and proprietary) serving 125,237 youngsters,
nearly one out of four students in Chicago. For example, in
our inner-city areas meeting federal poverty guidelines, 135
Catholic schools serve more than 42,000 students, of whom 80%
are minorities and 40% non-Catholics. Their tuition costs
average $1,400 per elementary and $2,800 per high-school
student, compared with $5,000 per student (K12 combined) in
the public schools.
   Why isn't business out in front, insisting that
market-like constraints be built into public education as a
condition for fiscal support? Why isn't business in every
state leading the effort for alternative teacher
certification, for privatization, for deregulation, for
genuine accountability legislation, and for the ultimate form
of accountability -- parental choice of public or private
education underwritten by vouchers, tuition tax credits or
tax rebates?
