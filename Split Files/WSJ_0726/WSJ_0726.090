   Seattle -- For the New Yorker who approaches Lincoln
Center with a live feeling of dread, Seattle is the place to
be. Not in a long time have I seen a production as poetic and
powerful as "War and Peace," the opera on which Sergei
Prokofiev toiled longer than Leo Tolstoy needed to write his
epic novel about Napoleon's invasion of Russia.
   Staged by the American director Francesca Zambello for the
Seattle Opera, a brick behemoth unhappily refurbished for the
1962 World's Fair, the production helped open the Goodwill
Games on Sunday, and proved to be an even better spectacle
than the Rev. Jesse Jackson. In another venue the perennial
presidential candidate implored sweaty listeners to "hug a
Russian" -- an invitation sensible folks found easy to ignore
in sticky weather that shot into the 90s. Moscow burning
couldn't have been much hotter.

   Sarah Caldwell's Boston company once performed the work
years ago, but "War and Peace" rarely is heard outside the
Soviet Union, and even the Bolshoi does not use an edition as
complete as Seattle's. The $2 million production ran four
hours with one intermission -- and brought onstage some 250
people, including a few soloists from the Kirov Opera, among
them a remarkable baritone named Vladimir Chernov, who sang
Andrei Bolkonsky.
   More importantly, the production demonstrated that "War
and Peace" is a superbly theatrical opera that deserves a
place in our major companies. Do those huggable Russians
still operate a gulag somewhere? I was hoping there might be
a little steel cot available for whoever at the New York City
Opera decided against collaborating with Seattle on this
venture.
   While New Yorkers gird themselves for City Opera's new
staging of "Moses and Aron" by Arnold Schoenberg, Seattle
shone a beam on an unjustly neglected work that grew like a
mushroom in the dark of Stalin's Russia. A political naif,
Prokofiev (1891-1953) started writing it a few years after
returning to Russia in 1934, where he landed, Shostakovich
once said, "like a chicken in soup."
   The rest of his life he spent picking up Stalin prizes,
six in all, and getting kicked in the pants for ideological
impurity. In "War and Peace," the Central Committee was
unhappy to detect a lack of patriotic fervor. The numerous
changes Prokofiev dutifully made included beefing up the War
section and inserting into Peace a ball scene with a waltz
for Natasha and Andrei. Stalin was very fond of Strauss
(Johann, not Richard]). But the great leader still didn't
have "War and Peace" staged during Prokofiev's lifetime, and
sent his first wife, Lina, to Siberia.
   For all that, and considering Prokofiev's talent for
churning out trashy propaganda music, "War and Peace" is
surprisingly eloquent. Prokofiev also had one of the 20th
century's great gifts for melody, and there are plenty in the
score (even if Natasha's theme is heard so often from so many
different people I was worried I might be called on next).
What surely helped inspire Prokofiev was the libretto
assistance he had from his second wife, Mira
Mendelson-Prokofieva. Against all odds, its 28 pages suggest
the descriptive immensity of Tolstoy's herniator.
   In Seattle, the opera opened with a choral epigraph as the
Russian people advanced slowly on a red-cloaked Napoleon,
singing of revenge for the pillaged motherland. They set the
scene for the ensuing 13 tableaux, returning at the opera's
end to cheer the victorious General Kutuzov. (The audience
responded by cheering them.) The music flowed seamlessly
through scenes as varied as the Rostov garden in spring to
the Borodino battleground, thanks not only to the dynamic
conducting of Mark Ermler of the Bolshoi, but to Ms. Zambello
and her singularily imaginative colleagues: set designer John
Conklin, lighting designer Neil Peter Jampolis and costumer
Bruno Schwengl.
   There is only one set, a big interior of a mansion. A
microcosm of the world outside, it changes over time into a
fire-stained ruin, through an evocative use of lights and
props. Symbolic of Napoleon's elusive prize, a model of
Moscow glows under hot gels like a golden treasure. Every
move is tightly directed, down to the extras who in the
dazzling ball scene (attractively choreographed by Vassili
Sulich) created constantly shifting views by just moving the
chairs. The 32-year-old Ms. Zambello, who has directed at La
Scala, Pesaro, Saint Louis, Houston and Chicago, achieves
more drama pushing props around than Franco Zeffirelli
manages with miles of drapes and spinning stages.
   Even better, she let the story unfold simply and
effectively, as a period piece with transcending themes that
need no contemporary filter. How many tendentious colleagues
would have resisted turning the French into Nazis at the
gates of Leningrad? Even the mention of Vilnius does not
bring to the stage any Balts begging to be free]
   A good chunk of the $2 million went into rehearsing the
huge cast, and the results show, with singers immersed in
their roles, characters firmly drawn. I have never seen Sheri
Greenawald so light on her feet. She was an affecting
Natasha, successfully conveying the girl's agitation in her
big aria. Unlike in the novel, Natasha does not marry Pierre
Bezukhov after Andrei's death. But we do hear the goodhearted
myopic sing of his love in a faintly grotesque scene in which
Natasha is trying to elope with yet a third man, only to be
caught by the motherly Maria Akhrosimova, who then asks poor
Pierre to stay for tea. Peter Kazaras, a very personable
performer, depicted Pierre perfectly.
   All the smaller roles were well done: Nicolai Ohotnikov as
Kutuzov; Julian Patrick as Napoleon; James Hoback as the
worthless Anatol; Sheila Nadler as Maria; Victoria Vergara as
Princess Helene, Pierre's pleasure-obsessed, empty-headed
wife, who wandered about with an amusing crown on her head.
   Still, it was Mr. Chernov who impressed most of all with
his vibrant baritone and natural stage presence. What
eloquence he brought to Prince Andrei's disturbing death
scene, the saddest pages in the score. Clinging to a life he
no longer wishes to leave, Andrei hears a strange, repetitive
sound; "something heavy, thudding against the walls," thinks
Natasha, who hears it too as she searches for him among the
wounded. What she's hearing is the human heart.
   Prokofiev's own death on March 5, 1953, went largely
unnoticed as Soviets wept copiously over the other corpse of
the day, Joseph Stalin's.
   Further performances are tomorrow, July 29 and 31; Aug. 2,
4 and 6. The sponsors include SAFECO Insurance Cos. and King
Broadcasting Co. Seattle is filming the production for
commercial release using high-definition television
technology that does not require the intrusively bright
lighting levels the Met's "Ring" cycle inflicted on paying
customers. In the meanwhile, a Fidelio CD set recorded by the
Sofia National Opera, sumptuously conducted by Rouslan
Raichev and featuring another impressive baritone, Lyubomir
Videnov, is a good introduction to this fine work.
