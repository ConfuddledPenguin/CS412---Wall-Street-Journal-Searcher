   SEOUL, South Korea -- As the Cold War thaws, the question
no longer is whether the Soviet Union and South Korea will
establish diplomatic relations, but when.
   The biggest question may turn out to be where to put the
Soviet Embassy. The Russians had an embassy in Seoul about a
century ago, but closed it in 1904 after Russia lost a war to
Japan and Japan took over Korea. Numerous Korean newspapers
have been wondering whether the Russians will get back the
land, currently designated as Korean National Treasure 253.

   It was a perfect location then -- spacious, right next to
the king's palace -- to which it was connected by secret
tunnels -- with a hilltop view of events inside.
   Now valued at between $50 million and $60 million, the
site would be a perfect place -- still centrally situated,
but now overlooking the U.S. ambassador's residence and the
future U.S. Embassy site. "It had a heck of a view of the
palace," says Peter Bartholomew, a U.S. businessman and
amateur local historian. "It still has a good view."
   Cold War thaw or not, U.S. diplomats in Seoul say
privately they would object if the South Koreans even
considered giving the property back. Says one official, as he
looks into the ambassador's back yard from the site, "We
wouldn't want another Mount Alto on our hands," referring to
the hilltop in Washington where a Soviet Embassy building
enjoys an excellent vantage point for pulling in U.S.
government communications.
   The Americans say they haven't said anything officially
about the issue to either party. At the Soviet trade office
in Seoul's World Trade Center, representatives refer callers
to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. And while that ministry
won't say whether any inquiries have been made by the
Soviets, an official says emphatically, "They are not
entitled to the property."
   Ministry officials claim the Russians have lost their
claim to the land, originally deeded to the czar. The
property, now shared by office buildings and a park, is a
historical site; in 1896, when China, Britain, Russia, Japan
and the U.S. squabbled over control of Korea, King Kojong
fled to the Russian Embassy for protection.
   Anywhere else the embassy goes is likely to cause a
problem. There was a flap in the local press early last year
after the Hungarians, then still under the thumb of the
Soviets, put their new embassy into a skyscraper overlooking
the U.S. Army base in central Seoul.
