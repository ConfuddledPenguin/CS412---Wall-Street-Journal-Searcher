   SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Mips Computer Systems Inc., citing
strong sales and broader acceptance of its computer
architecture, reported a profit for the second quarter on a
75% increase in revenue, compared with a net loss last year.
   The computer maker said net income for the quarter was $4
million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a net loss of
$2.1 million, or 11 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
Second-quarter revenue increased to $39.6 million from $22.6
million in 1989, it said.

   Mips sells workstations that employ
reduced-instruction-set-computing, or Risc, technology, which
is increasingly popular among buyers of computers that use
the Unix operating system. Financial analysts have been
watching the start-up's product sales closely since it went
public last December because it is taking on heavyweights
such as Hewlett-Packard Co. Mips said revenues from its
products were up 73% in the quarter to $28.3 million from
$16.4 million a year ago.
   For the six months, Mips reported net of $7.5 million, or
30 cents a share, compared with loss of $1.2 million, or 6
cents a share, in the year-earlier six months.
