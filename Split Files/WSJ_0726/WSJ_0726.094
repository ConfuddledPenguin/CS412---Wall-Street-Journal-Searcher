   Descendants of a founding father of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
have launched a proxy fight to force the Cincinnati-based
consumer-products giant to stop buying Salvadoran beans for
its Folgers coffee.
   James Gamble, great-great grandson and namesake of the
soap maker who founded P&amp;G with candle maker William Procter
in 1837, has submitted the proposal for consideration at
P&amp;G's annual meeting in October.

   The proposal is backed by Mr. Gamble's brother Robert and
their father, Walter, along with P&amp;G shareholder Pat Close,
according to Steven Koenig, a vice president of the
money-management firm Franklin Research &amp; Development Corp.
Mr. Koenig said the resolution asks P&amp;G to stop buying from
suppliers in El Salvador "until parties to the Salvadoran
conflict fully negotiate a peaceful settlement of the war."
The U.S.-supported Salvadoran government has been fighting
leftist guerrillas in a civil war for about a decade.
   Mr. Koenig wouldn't disclose details about the
shareholders involved or the size of their P&amp;G holdings,
describing them only as "substantial shareholders." None of
them could be located for comment.
   P&amp;G has 102,953 shareholders, with no individual holder
owning more than 0.5% of its 346 million shares outstanding,
according to P&amp;G officials.
   Mr. Gamble has talked with P&amp;G officials, but recent talks
weren't fruitful: "We're just too far apart," Mr. Koenig
said.
   P&amp;G's board will oppose the proposal, but a spokesman
declined to comment further on Mr. Gamble's actions until
next month, when P&amp;G's proxy statement is to be mailed to
holders.
   Folgers coffee, the target of a boycott by other
activists, contains less than 2% Salvadoran beans, the
spokesman said. "Folgers has been unfairly singled out," the
spokesman said. "We're doing the right thing by abiding by
current U.S. policy" toward El Salvador, he said.
   Mr. Koenig said the group plans to send proxy solicitation
statements to all holders in the next few weeks. At the
least, the group wants enough votes to ensure that the
proposal can return to the P&amp;G ballot next year if it's
defeated in October. That would require support from holders
of 3% of the shares. "But it's not unheard of to think we
could get at least 20% to 30%," Mr. Koenig said.
