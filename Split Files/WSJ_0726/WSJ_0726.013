   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association agreed to sell its
huge junk-bond portfolio to a Canadian investor group at an
unexpectedly high price, but the proposed financing of the
transaction carries some risk for the U.S. taxpayer.
   Edward G. Harshfield, Columbia's chief executive officer,
said a partnership associated with Gordon Investment Corp.
agreed to pay $3 billion for the thrift's portfolio of junk
bonds and preferred stock. Gordon is a largely
employee-owned, Toronto-based merchant bank that numbers
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and a General Electric Co.
subsidiary among its investors. The portfolio was valued at
$2.93 billion at March 31, after a plunge that dumped $890
million of losses on Columbia, rendering it insolvent.

   Selling such a large amount of junk bonds into the
battered and illiquid junk-bond market was considered
improbable just weeks ago. But that market has recovered
slightly, and Columbia offered unexpectedly favorable terms:
90% financing on a so-called non-recourse basis. That means
that the buyer can walk away from the portfolio if additional
losses exceed 10%, and the seller will in effect have to take
the bonds back. The financing and the limited risk is mainly
what motivated Gordon to pay Columbia a slight premium for a
portfolio that many investment bankers thought would have to
be discounted a further 10% to 15%.
   The feat could save Columbia, or at least sharply reduce
or even eliminate government losses if the Beverly Hills,
Calif., thrift were to fail. Moreover, the transaction could
prove a model for dispensing with about $4 billion more of
junk bonds that the government has inherited from seized
thrifts.
   But the plan carries considerable risk for the government,
which would inherit the junk bonds if the market turns sour
again, forcing Gordon to return them to a Columbia that would
then be doomed to an even more expensive failure. Regulators
and congressmen therefore might oppose the transaction.
   "Almost as dubious as the purchase of junk bonds with
taxpayer-insured deposits is financing of junk bonds with
insured deposits, especially on a non-recourse basis," said
Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa). "Given the circumstances, this may
wind up being a reasonable deal for the government. But as
attractive as the bold print of this deal may be, the fine
print seems questionable."
   Mr. Leach also questioned whether the Columbia deal should
become a model for the government's future management of its
current junk-bond portfolio. "The idea should be to move this
industry out of junk bonds" and other forms of "roulette
finance," he remarked. The Columbia deal "may be a
conceivable approach in some instances, but it's not at all
desirable," he said.
   Columbia has two other big problems: it still needs to
raise an estimated $300 million or so in additional capital
to meet regulatory standards. It can raise a good chunk of
that by selling its equity interests in some highly leveraged
companies. Those interests were valued at $230 million at
March 31, but investment bankers say their value may be as
little as $100 million because they are such illiquid
investments. In any event, Columbia will still need cash from
outside investors; such an investment will probably wipe out
shareholders. Also, by selling the bonds, it is losing its
biggest single source of cash, and the interest that it will
be receiving on the financing barely covers billions of
dollars in high-cost brokered deposits that remain on its
books. Some analysts believe that will make it next to
impossible for Columbia to be very profitable anytime soon
and that a federal seizure remains a possibility.
   However, Mr. Harshfield indicated he thought regulators
would find it hard to turn down the proposed bond sale. He
says rating agencies have already indicated that terms of the
underlying note are sufficiently rigorous to warrant an
investment-grade rating. He said regulators were already
starting to review the transaction, and that a decision is
expected within 60 days.
   "I would be highly surprised if there was a better price
to be gotten from this portfolio," he added. "I am extremely
confident that this is a good package." He says Columbia is
already actively considering buyers for the rest of the
institution, adding, "I think there is still a possibility
that we can pull this thing out."
   If regulators prohibit the deal, the alternatives aren't
very appetizing. To sell the entire junk-bond portfolio
without non-recourse financing might require discounts that
would add $300 million or more to Columbia's losses,
virtually assuring its failure at a high cost to the
government. Columbia already has a negative net worth of $216
million, a deficit that is expected to grow to nearly $300
million because of expected losses for the second quarter
ended June 30.
   In Washington, D.C., a spokesman for the Office of Thrift
Supervision had no comment on the proposed sale but promised
an "expeditious" review of it. The agency is being advised by
General Electric's Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. brokerage subsidiary.
The spokesman said regulators didn't consider that a problem
because General Electric's interest in Gordon Investment is
fractional and indirect. "There's a Chinese Wall that they
assured us would be meticulously observed," he added.
   Gordon Investment itself is something of an unorthodox
choice to come to the rescue. It has never before invested in
junk bonds, much less a portfolio the size of Columbia's, and
until yesterday, the boldest deal it had ever pulled off was
probably an investment in Canada's phone company two years
ago.
   "Everybody has phoned" wanting to know what prompted the
company's apparent shift in strategy, says partner Thomas
I.A. Allen. "We hope when the dust settles over a number of
years, that people will know the answer to that question." He
says the Columbia bonds presented "attractive investment
values over the long term."
   Columbia and other thrifts are under the gun to sell their
junk bonds because of a provision in the thrift bailout law
last year. The thrift said there were eight final bidders for
its portfolio. They are believed to have included Loews
Corp., Broad Inc. and Bankers Trust Corp.
