   James River Corp., Richmond, Va., said its European
affiliate JA/MONT N.V. bought Cartellas S.A. and Achaia S.A.,
two tissue companies in Athens, Greece, formerly owned by the
Panopoulos family.
   Terms were not disclosed. The two companies, which market
under the Delica brand name in Greece, posted combined 1989

million; sales for Achaia were $7.2 million.

   The two companies combined represent the second largest
tissue producer in the Greek market, with a 15 to 20% share,
the company said.
   The acquisition is the first by JA/MONT V.A., a joint
venture formed this year that combined James River's European
tissue interests with those of Gruppo Ferruzzi of Italy and
Nokia Corp. of Finland. The joint venture expects sales of
$1.6 billion in 1990.
