   LANCASTER, N.H. -- Kids are saying the darndest things
about balloons.
   Suppose, they are saying, some grownups set free a batch
of balloons at a grand opening or something. And suppose one
of the balloons landed in the ocean.

   "An animal could eat it mistaking it for a meal," Annie
White recently fretted, in an essay for her fourth-grade
class. The balloon "could block its stomach, so it could not
eat anymore. So it would die. Then it could be hit by a boat
repeller or get injured."
   Miss White isn't the only one who is concerned about
turning balloons loose in the environment. In Pennsylvania,
sixth-graders asked the state legislature to curb balloon
launches. So did eighth-graders in Southern California, who
flew to the state capital to lobby. And in Connecticut, the
children have clobbered the opposition.
   A bill in Connecticut's legislature to curb the launches
faced opposition and "wasn't going anywhere," says State Rep.
Mary Mushinsky of Wallingford. "Then the fourth-graders came
in all dressed up, with bow ties and dresses. They looked the
members in the eye, and each read two sentences" favoring the
bill. "That did it." Now Connecticut has a law banning all
open-air launches of 10 or more balloons.
   The balloon industry is fit to be tied. It says crafty
environmentalists lacking proof have spread false alarms to
whip up a children's crusade. Balloons are attacked mainly
because they're a target kids can't miss, this $1 billion
industry says. Environmentalists tend to agree that in terms
of threats to marine animals, latex balloons are much less of
a problem than plastics. And only balloon launches into the
air, not balloons as such, are the subject of criticism.
   An industry point man on the issue is Rick Tillotson, who
has deep roots in the balloon business. His father, Neil
Tillotson, is credited with inventing a latex balloon in
Watertown, Mass., in 1931. The younger Mr. Tillotson runs his
own firm in Dixville Notch, N.H., called Tilly Balloon Co.,
and when he gets wind of balloons being bashed, he doesn't
clown around. Mr. Tillotson charges that "evil" manipulation
of children's minds of the sort practiced by some
anti-balloon adults "would be a good way to bring on Nazism."
   Lately, balloons have been soaring. U.S. balloon sales
have doubled since the mid-1980s, and rose 34% last year
alone, says Debra Paulk, editor of a magazine called Balloons
Today. However, now some firms find their sales hurt by the
flap. "We've lost upwards of $60,000 of business in the last
year" because of it, says Philip Levin, president of Balloon
City USA Inc. in Harrisburg, Pa.
   Some vendors are rumbling ominously about suing two New
Jersey teachers they blame for starting the crusade. The
balloon people are financing studies they hope will prove
balloon launches benign. They have hired lobbyists to quash
kid-backed balloon bills.
   To protest the Pennsylvania bill, Mr. Levin took to
launching balloons daily next to the state capitol. However,
a foe came along and tried to pop them with a knife. The
balloon man blew up.
   "The guy {with the knife} was screaming, `The balloons are
killing animals,'" says Mr. Levin. "He broke three or four
before I could push him away. It was on TV, showing me
pushing him."
   What set all this off was the discovery, in July 1985, of
a sick sperm whale washed up on a New Jersey beach. It
eventually died when dashed against a pier, and Robert
Schoelkopf, founder of the nonprofit Marine Mammal Stranding
Center of Brigantine, N.J., did a post-mortem. Inside the
stomach he found a Mylar balloon. He concluded that the
silvery, heart-shaped plastic balloon -- which isn't the sort
used in launches -- had plugged the whale's digestive tract,
making it too weak to swim.
   Two years later, on a different New Jersey beach, a
leatherneck turtle turned up dead with a latex balloon inside
it. It was found by Peter and Susan Hibbard, who teach
high-school biology in Toms River, N.J., and are associated
with Mr. Schoelkopf's center. A few months later, the couple
formed the Balloon Alert Project.
   It has built a growing network of like-minded teachers and
students. And in recent months, balloon launches have been
canceled in several states. Under pressure from
environmentalists, Walt Disney World and Disneyland have
halted balloon releases. Ms. Hibbard makes clear that "we
aren't against balloons, only balloon releases."
   Nevertheless, says Dan Flynn, spokesman for Pioneer
Balloon Co. of Wichita, Kan., "Some children are getting the
idea that all balloons are bad. And when kids are brought
{into legislative hearings}, you don't have a chance."
   Here in Lancaster, 58 students have formed the Balloon
Launch Terminators, or BLTs. In May, the group stopped a
school balloon launch, then sent a letter to a local paper
urging others to do likewise.
   Two days later, Mr. Tillotson phoned. "He was after my
hide," says Andrea Craxton, a third-grade teacher who had
helped the BLTs get started. Soon, Mr. Tillotson marched into
the school (by invitation) armed with latex samples, a
scripted lecture and a pop quiz to set the record straight.
First question: "I understand that silver metallic and
ordinary rubber latex balloons are different. Yes or No."
   Then came a comic book featuring Lex Latex, a talking
balloon. "Balloon releases," Mr. Latex advised, "are safe and
beautiful."
   Few in the audience were won over. "I still do not think
balloon launches are very safe for animals," wrote Miss
White, who will be in the fifth grade this fall. "Because one
day my dog swallowed a piece. And she died."
   The BLTs concede some of the industry's points seem valid.
But, says fellow fifth-grader Erin Fogg: "It didn't make much
sense when he said our `little hearts would be broken' if we
couldn't have balloon releases. We can live without them."
   With the help of teachers, the BLTs are doing an in-depth
study of balloons before making another move. They have
learned there are few documented cases of balloons being
found inside animals, and no clear proof the animals died
from eating them. They are looking at an industry-sponsored
study indicating that released latex balloons typically rise
about five miles, then shatter into bits that decay fairly
rapidly. They have heard that when University of Miami
biologist Peter Lutz fed balloon shreds to sea turtles in
another industry-funded study, the pieces eventually came out
the other end.
   On the other hand, they have learned Mr. Lutz is concerned
because some balloon shreds got balled up inside the turtles
and took months to pass through them. From their own
experiments, the students have found that balloon bits can
take months to fully decay outdoors. They have heard that in
a 1989 national beach cleanup lasting only a few hours,
volunteers found 18,251 balloons.
   All this is a bit overwhelming, but it has "encouraged a
lot of questioning by the kids," says Ron Pelchat, one of the
BLTs' teachers. Elizabeth Riff, another teacher, says: "The
more we read, the more we're getting fired up."
   The BLTs aren't entirely sure what they're getting fired
up to do. But whatever it is, wrote Sarah Tetreault in her
fourth-grade essay, "I want to make the world a beautifuler
place."
