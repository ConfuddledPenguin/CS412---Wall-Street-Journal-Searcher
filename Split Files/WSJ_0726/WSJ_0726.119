   Interco Inc., St. Louis, is telling its bankers that it
doesn't expect to make an interest payment due next week on
its bank debt, according to people familiar with the
company's finances.
   Interco, a footwear and furniture company, said in May
that it might file for bankruptcy protection from creditors
as part of an effort to restructure its $1.9 billion in
debts.

   Interco said it is holding constructive negotiations with
its banks and bondholders. "We believe it is inappropriate at
this time to comment on any aspect of those talks," the
company added.
   Wilbur Ross, a Rothschild Inc. managing director, who is
advising bondholders, said he doesn't expect that an Interco
default on its $700 million of bank debt will greatly change
the company's position with creditors.
   Mr. Ross added that Interco already has defaulted on
enough of its obligations that creditors could file an
involuntary bankruptcy petition if they wanted to. But "as
long as people feel that debt restructuring talks are making
progress, there's no need for anything precipitous."
