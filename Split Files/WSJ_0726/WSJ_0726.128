   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Mentor Graphics Inc. said a shareholder
filed a class-action suit alleging federal securities
violations. The suit alleges that "the company withheld
material and adverse information from the public during the
period between April 20 and July 3," when the company
announced that it didn't expect to meet previous earnings
expectations.
   Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thomas H. Bruggere
called the suit frivolous.
