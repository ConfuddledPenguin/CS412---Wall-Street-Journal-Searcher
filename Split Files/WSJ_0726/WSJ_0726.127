   Action Industries Inc. said it will report an operating
loss and additional restructuring charges for the fiscal year
ended June 30. However, the company said it is unable to
estimate the size of the losses.
   In fiscal 1989, Pittsburgh-based Action earned $1.8
million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $134.2 million. The
company sells housewares, gifts and other promotional
merchandise to retailers, and provides advertising and other
support services to help retailers build customer traffic.

   The restructuring plan includes a sharp reduction in
inventories and receivables, the sale of certain other
nonproductive assets, curtailment of foreign operations and
the elimination of about 25% of the nearly 250 office jobs at
corporate headquarters, said R. Craig Kirsch, president and
chief executive officer.
   Action will focus on its core business, he said, pulling
back from other activities.
   Action stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $3 a
share in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
