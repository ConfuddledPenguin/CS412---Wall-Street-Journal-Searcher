   TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co. said it has
canceled plans to complete the conversion of a 104.5-megawatt
generating unit to coal-firing capability.
   Irvington Station Unit 3 in Tucson will continue to
operate on natural gas or oil, and modification work to
include coal as an alternative boiler fuel by 1992 has been
halted, the company said.

   In 1981, the U.S. Department of Energy ordered the company
to convert the Irvington Station to coal in accordance with
the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.
Rescinded in 1987, the act would have prohibited power plants
from burning natural gas as a boiler fuel after 1990.
   By not completing the conversion of Unit 3, the company
estimates that it will avoid $25 million in additional
construction expenditures.
   Tucson Electric has been troubled by a stream of
misdirected investments in real estate and financial
services, as well as by apparent excess construction of
generating capacity. In January, cash-flow problems forced
the company to eliminate its quarterly dividend on common
stock for the first time since it went public in 1946.
