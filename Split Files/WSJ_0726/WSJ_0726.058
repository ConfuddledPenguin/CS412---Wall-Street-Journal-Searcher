   Gerber Products Co., citing strong sales of baby food,
said earnings for its first quarter rose 17% to $31.3
million, or 83 cents a share.
   The Fremont, Mich., baby-food concern said successful
promotions and increased distribution in the quarter
contributed to a volume increase of 6%.

   In the year-earlier quarter, Gerber earned $26.8 million,
or 70 cents a share. Sales for the latest quarter, ended June
30, rose 12% to $295.9 million from $263.9 million.
   The company said that while it is pleased with these
results, "there are indications that some of this increase
may have resulted from advance buying by our customers."
   Consequently, Gerber said, volume for its second quarter
is expected to be flat with the year-earlier period. But for
the full year, it said volume gains are expected to be "in
excess of those projected for the industry."
