   NEW YORK -- Gold futures rebounded from Tuesday's setback
and closed firm despite late profit-taking.
   August delivery gold rose $4 an ounce to $372.40 after
trading as high as $375.50. September silver was up 1.5 cents
an ounce at $4.87. October platinum advanced $2.90 an ounce
to $485.80.

   Gold turned in a particularly solid performance. The
August contract never fell below Tuesday's close; even at the
day's low of $370, it was up $1.60.
   Gold's advance slowed in the afternoon, when the August
contract reached its high for the day. Resistance then
developed and the price slipped.
   In addition to the technical resistance, some selling was
stimulated by a lessening of tensions in the Middle East.
Iraq and Kuwait agreed to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over
the weekend to resolve their dispute over the amount of oil
that Kuwait is producing and other matters.
   A stronger dollar in the afternoon also contributed to the
weakness, analysts said.
   According to Sharon Ziemian, vice president of Citibank,
New York, the activity for the most part appears to be from
major traders with "deep pockets," with little speculative
participation.
   "This has created a combination of short covering, which
was very evident Monday and has continued, and new buying by
these interests, which has given the market strong underlying
support," Ms. Ziemian said.
   "Speculators may be exercising caution after having seen
lower markets and they are looking for a little longer
follow-through. However, all in all, in view of the limited
amount of news, the market is doing very well."
   The short covering, or the buying back of contracts that
had been sold because traders thought prices would go lower,
continued strongly into Tuesday.
   Figures released yesterday by the Commodity Exchange
showed that the open interest, or the number of outstanding
contracts that remain to be nullified by opposite trades or
satisfied by the delivery of gold, continued to decline as a
result of Tuesday's trading.
   The total open interest in gold declined 3,941 contracts
from Monday to stand at 97,848. The decline in three sessions
this week has caused open interest in gold to drop below that
of the less actively traded silver futures despite a decline
in silver's open interest Tuesday. Silver's total open
interest was 98,101 contracts, down from Monday's 98,426.
   Ken Gettinger, precious metals vice president for Union
Bank of Switzerland, New York, said support for the market
began with buying of gold bullion in Europe and continued
through the day.
   "Gold has been a very active market this week," he said.
"The market has been reflecting the Middle East tensions, a
weaker dollar and anticipation of easier interest rates.
Futures have been helped by technical support after the
August contract rose above $370. Also a contributing factor
has been the weakness in the stock market and in
dollar-denominated assets."
   A very important factor, Mr. Gettinger said, is a
short-term shortage of gold bullion: "Physical supplies in
both London and New York seem to be extremely scarce. The
result has been higher gold interest rates and an upward
pressure on the spot price."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed mixed in light
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Reports that
ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries have already reached a consensus to prop up prices
and rein in production did little to spark buying, because
most traders believe the market has factored in a bullish
outcome of the OPEC meeting under way in Geneva. As an
example of how "headline trading" on OPEC news has given way
to reality, news on Dow Jones International Petroleum Report
that the United Arab Emirates' oil minister said he would
accept a daily production quota of 1.5 million barrels didn't
even budge prices. That level is far below the UAE's recent
production. News before the opening of trading that Kuwait's
oil minister had backed away from insisting on an increased
quota for the fourth quarter also had no effect. Despite the
impending OPEC accords, the market is viewed as fundamentally
weak, with U.S. crude oil inventories about 53 million
barrels above last year's levels.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for hog and pork belly futures
rallied, rebounding from last week's steep sell-off in
response to increased retail demand for pork products. Pork
belly futures for delivery in August closed up the daily
limit of two cents a pound, aided by good out-of-storage
movement of frozen bellies, said Jerry Abbenhaus, a futures
analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. Figures
released after the close of Tuesday's trading showed that 5.4
million pounds of frozen pork bellies were shipped to
processors from warehouses near Chicago last week. That
figure was lower than the year-earlier shipment of 6,050,000
pounds but was seen as buoying prices because supplies of
frozen pork bellies have declined substantially over the past
year, Mr. Abbenhaus said. August pork belly futures closed at
47.12 cents a pound. Live hog futures prices also gained
ground on news of relatively tight supplies. August hog
futures closed up 1.3 cents at 60.67 cents a pound.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were higher. The September contract
rose 1.25 cents a pound to $1.2165. Analysts said some
support was due to concern over whether workers at a mine in
Peru would walk out in a labor dispute. One analyst said it
might be a "non-event" because many scheduled strikes in Peru
don't actually occur. Another analyst said a major stumbling
block in the talks between the miners and the company was a
demand for wages to be linked to inflation. Also, the analyst
said, the relatively large open interest in the July futures
contract, which will cease trading tomorrow, may have
contributed some firmness. He also said the rebound in the
stock market yesterday may be reflecting greater confidence
in the economy, which would favor increased demand for
industrial materials such as copper.
