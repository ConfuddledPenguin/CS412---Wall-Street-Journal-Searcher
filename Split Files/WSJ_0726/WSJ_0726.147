   BP Canada Inc. said it will lay off about 120 of its 1,760
employees under a reorganization plan that will result in
separate units for its mining and oil and gas businesses.
   BP Canada, based in Calgary, Alberta, wouldn't disclose
the costs associated with the layoffs, which will begin with
the severance of 80 employees in the current quarter, and the
balance later this year or early in 1991. The moves reflect
an effort to cut costs, the company said.

   "We should see a substantially improved performance in
future," said Vince Vianello, vice-president, human
resources. He didn't offer a specific forecast. For the
quarter ended March 31, BP Canada had net earnings of 6
million Canadian dollars (US$5.2 million) or 12 Canadian
cents a share on sales of C$104.7 million, down from a net of
C$7.2 million or 14 cents a share on sales of C$94 million
the previous year.
   BP Canada is 57%-owned by British Petroleum Co.
