   NEW YORK -- Diana Temple, the veteran tobacco analyst at
Salomon Brothers Inc., has been telling the world that RJR
Nabisco Inc.'s warrants look significantly undervalued at
today's prices.
   What Ms. Temple isn't publicizing is that Salomon is
almost certainly the biggest single holder of those RJR
warrants. In an obscure Securities and Exchange Commission
filing in mid-June, Salomon vice chairman Stanley Shopkorn
disclosed that Salomon owned 4.7 million of the warrants, or
10% of the total outstanding.

   That creates some awkward problems for Salomon, which
would like to be known both as a trading powerhouse and a
reliable source of impartial investment research.
   Ms. Temple says she is playing things strictly by the
book. "The rule around Salomon is: You talk first to the
customers; then you talk to {Salomon's own} trading desk,"
she says. As far back as last January or February, Ms. Temple
says, she began telling clients why she thought the tobacco
and food company's warrants might be a good buy.
   The trouble is, most of Salomon's customers weren't
listening. RJR's warrants, which give holders the right to
buy equity in closely held RJR, languished between $4 and $6
apiece during the winter and early spring, even though Ms.
Temple argued that they might be worth $8 to $13. (She
currently values them "conservatively" at $8 to $9.)
   Meanwhile this spring, Salomon's traders gobbled up any
warrants they could find. Salomon's main buyer, convertible
bond trader John Sandelman, won't talk about the firm's
holdings or whether Ms. Temple influenced his thinking. But
traders at other firms say they believe Mr. Sandelman began
buying last April, picking up a lot of warrants from the
Belzberg family of Canada. The Belzbergs won't comment.
   Traders say they believe Mr. Sandelman recently has plowed
even more of Salomon's cash into RJR's warrants.
   The warrants were unchanged yesterday at $6.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Assuming that Salomon did most of its buying at lower
prices, it has a modest paper profit already on its RJR
warrants.
   Now Ms. Temple is in a quandary. If she remains vocally
bullish on the RJR warrants, clients may regard her analysis
as merely an effort to talk up Salomon's big holdings. "To
me, the fact that Salomon has $30 million invested in RJR
warrants is much more eloquent than anything an analyst might
say," says one portfolio manager who has traded actively in
RJR securities.
   Things will get even stickier if Ms. Temple turns bearish,
or Mr. Sandelman decides to unload his warrants. "In general,
a Wall Street firm can't trade against its analysts'
recommendations," says a New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman.
So if Ms. Temple says "sell," Mr. Sandelman's buying binge
ought to come to an end. Or if Mr. Sandelman wants to cash
out, Ms. Temple presumably will have to cool her enthusiasm
for the RJR warrants.
   If Salomon had its way, few people would know about the
delicate maneuverings between its research and trading
departments. When the Wall Street firm made its SEC filing,
Salomon's Mr. Shopkorn added a note saying that Salomon
"expressly disclaims that it has a filing obligation with
respect to the warrants" because they aren't yet convertible
into RJR common stock.
   Still, Salomon's legal department said the filing should
be made in any case.
   Now regulators and Salomon clients can watch to see how
the trader-analyst minuet will unfold. "It's a very complex
area," says Larry Bergman, an associate director of the SEC.
"There aren't any bright lines about what firms can and can't
do."
