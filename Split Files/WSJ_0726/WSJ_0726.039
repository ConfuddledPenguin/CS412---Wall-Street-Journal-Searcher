   LONDON -- The cash-strapped Soviet Union is selling
diamonds worth $5 billion to the Swiss arm of De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd. and is borrowing $1 billion from the
company.
   The contract between De Beers Centenary AG and
Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet adminstration for precious metals
and diamonds, is for the exclusive sale of Soviet rough uncut
diamonds over five years, said Gary Ralfe, a director of De
Beers Centenary. The company also received $1 billion of
diamonds as collateral, and Mr. Ralfe said these diamonds
would be sold during the five-year period to redeem the debt.

   The deal obviously suits both parties, London diamond
dealers say. The Soviet Union has been having difficulty
paying its overseas trade creditors, and De Beers wants to
stop the Soviet Union and other producing nations from
selling increasing amounts of diamonds outside the De Beers
diamond cartel.
   De Beers is negotiating new sales contracts with Botswana
and Australia, so guaranteed diamond supplies from the
Soviets will encourage other members to toe the line, dealers
said. The South African cartel, which controls 80% of the
international rough diamond market, sells stones from its own
mines and those of other African countries, Australia and
elsewhere through its London-based Central Selling
Organization.
   While De Beers Centenary is a Swiss company, Mr. Ralfe
said the sale represented the first time in nearly three
decades that the Soviet Union had openly associated itself
with commodities dealings linked to a South African company.
South Africa and the Soviet Union are the world's biggest
producers of gold, platinum and a variety of strategic
metals, and in the past few years sometimes surreptitiously
cooperated on sales tactics, dealers say. The Soviet Union,
for example, sold its diamonds to the De Beers diamond cartel
through intermediaries, Mr. Ralfe said.
   "This is a very important deal for both the Soviet Union
and De Beers," said Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of
De Beers. The Soviet Union is raising $1 billion at a time of
considerable financial strain, while the contract will
contribute to the continued stability and prosperity of the
international diamond industry, he said.
   Estimates that the Soviet Union produces 12 million carats
of diamonds a year, or 13% of world output, are conservative,
Mr. Ralfe said. Its mines in the Yaktia region of
northeastern Siberia are rich, and the Soviet Union and
Botswana are the two largest producers of gem diamonds in the
world, he said.
   Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, the Soviet state
bank, announced previously that the Soviet Union would sell
and deposit gold and other commodities as collateral to raise
about $2.5 billion. Indeed, about 200 to 300 metric tons of
gold deposited as collateral with Western banks, has already
been "swapped" for foreign exchange, bullion dealers
estimate. The nation is forced to use commodities as
collateral for loans because delays in payments to suppliers
in the West and Japan are discouraging foreign banks from
lending it money, analysts say.
   Those sales may already be having an effect: Just
yesterday, a Japanese trade organization reported that
Moscow's overdue payments for Japanese exports had leveled
off in June, after rising for six straight months. The group
said payment arrears by Soviet trading organizations totaled
$446 million at the end of June, only a $2 million increase
from May. The trade group attributed the leveling off both to
increased payments by the Soviets and to the fact that
Japan's trading houses were more hesitant about doing
business with Soviet concerns.
   "I believe this problem is passing its peak," an official
of one major Japanese trading house told Japan's Kyodo news
service.
   Moscow's foreign borrowings amounted to as much as $43
billion at the end of 1989, estimates the Bank for
International Settlements.
