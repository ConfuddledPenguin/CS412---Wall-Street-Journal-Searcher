   DIME SAVINGS BANK OF NEW YORK (Garden City, N.Y.) --
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered ratings on various securities
of Dime, noting "continued declining asset quality
indicators" and expected increases in nonperforming assets.
S&amp;P lowered medium-term notes to triple B-minus from triple
B, and commercial paper to single A-3 from A-2, and lowered
ratings on certificates of deposit. The ratings concern said
the detrimental effect of carrying approximately $750 million
in nonperforming assets on overall profitability will be
significant over the next two years.
