   PINKHAM NOTCH, N.H. -- Nobody wanted to fight the Battle
of Flat Mountain Pond.
   For more than a century, Flat Mountain Pond was a
half-forgotten back-country trout pond known only to hardy
sport fishermen and devout hikers who ventured seven miles up
into the vistas of New Hampshire's White Mountains. But today
the pond is the focus of one of the most bitter environmental
struggles in the nation, a collision of interests that pits
conservationists who want to preserve the wilderness against
disabled people who want a whiff of it for themselves.

   "This is a classic confrontation," says Kenneth Kimball,
director of research for the Appalachian Mountain Club, "but
a sad one."
   This week, as President Bush prepares to sign the
Americans with Disabilities Act to require increased access
and opportunities for the nation's disabled, a coalition of
environmental groups is pressing forward with its effort to
stop the U.S. Forest Service from "upgrading" the Flat
Mountain Pond Trail and installing as many as 13 rustic
bridges to permit vehicles to carry disabled people to the
edge of the federal Sandwich Range Wilderness.
   "This is an issue we hate," says Emily Bateson, senior
scientist for the Conservation Law Foundation of New England,
which is leading the effort to stop the trail upgrade. "But
we don't want to {put in} a road like this."
   The debate has prompted high emotions among the disabled
and among the legions of hikers who regard the White
Mountains as something of a sanctuary, splitting the
tranquility of a corner of New Hampshire that provided a
refuge for politicians like Daniel Webster, an inspiration
for writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, and a brilliant
panorama for landscape artists like Thomas Cole.
   "I don't feel we're fighting people in wheelchairs," says
Michael Kellett, New England regional director of the
Wilderness Society. "We're fighting an ill-conceived plan
that won't benefit many people in wheelchairs."
   Republican state Rep. Raymond Conley, a paraplegic who
used a wheelchair for nearly four decades after being
disabled as a Navy pilot in the Korean War, responds: "Some
of these folks are trying to tell handicapped people where
they belong. They're saying there are other places that are
more appropriate for us. Who says so? People who can walk and
carry backpacks. There are a lot of well-meaning people who
are making decisions for the disabled."
   The battle has skewed the usual alliances, both here in
the notches of the North Country and in the offices of the
federal bureaucracy. The disabled are siding with the
government. Environmentalists are finding themselves in the
uncomfortable position of opposing the disabled at a time
when the disability-rights movement is flush with triumph in
Congress. A provision in the bill that Mr. Bush is expected
to sign today specifically permits the creation of access for
the disabled up to a wilderness boundary.
   "I'd rather vote against an environmentalist than a guy in
a wheelchair," says GOP Rep. James Hansen of Utah, a House
Interior Committee member who championed the
wilderness-boundary provision in the disability bill. "Most
of these environmentalists don't know one end of a pine tree
from another but they like the calendars they get."
   The trail that is causing all the controversy hugs the
boundary of the Sandwich Range Wilderness but doesn't pierce
it. The changes call for 13 bridges as long as 46 feet and
for treated decks 10 feet wide, with about 140 feet of wooden
raised deck near the end of the trail and a "small, primitive
parking lot away from and out of sight of the pond."
   The access plan would permit four vehicles a day of less
than 4,000 pounds to follow the path from Sandwich Notch Road
to the summit of Carrigan Outlook, up the top of a highlands
knob, over the east fork of a spring brook, beyond the
Wonalancet River and on up to Flat Mountain Pond.
   And though the trail won't be an upcountry version of the
Merritt Parkway or even a rustic Route 66, the specter of
automobiles plying the sylvan reaches of the Sandwich Range
troubles environmentalists, who complain about "disruption of
the wilderness character of the area through noise, road
development, ruts, fumes and other conflicts." The
Conservation Law Foundation's appeal argues that the upgrade
would harm the wilderness by introducing "the sounds, smells
and possibly sights of the internal-combustion engine --
which symbolizes the very antithesis of wilderness."
   Rep. Conley argues that the road is merely an improvement
of an existing railroad bed (like many parts of the White
Mountains, the area was heavily logged in the last century)
and that environmentalists want to keep the wilderness to
themselves. "The wilderness zealots don't want the
internal-combustion engine ruining their wilderness
experience," he says. "That's the sum and substance of their
whole argument."
   The coalition of environmental groups against the plan
include the Sierra Club, the Sandwich Range Conservation
Association and the Wonalancet Out Door Club; the Appalachian
Mountain Club, a major voice in the White Mountains, hasn't
taken a position. The opponents emphasize, however, that they
don't want to exclude the disabled from the White Mountains.
   "We want all sorts of handicapped access," says Ms.
Bateson of the Conservation Law Foundation. "But it has to be
done with sensitivity to the resource and the other users. We
can't carve up our wilderness in the name of the
handicapped."
   Advocates of the Flat Mountain Pond plan are contending
that the plan wouldn't substantially change the character of
the area. "The whole idea is to give the handicapped a
challenge, not to provide a paved path that a two-wheel-drive
car can go down," says Douglas Eoute, chief of the bureau of
trails in the New Hampshire Division of Parks.
   The Forest Service has a number of campgrounds around the
country to accommodate the disabled, and it has built several
short trails of about a hundred yards for wheelchairs. One
wheelchair path, the Sheepshead Trail of Deer Lodge National
Forest in Montana, is about a mile long. But no access path
for the disabled is as ambitious as that contemplated for
Flat Mountain Pond.
   Some disabled activists, however, would rather not have
such an ambitious project. "There's a knee-jerk reaction that
people with disabilities need to have motors to get access to
wilderness areas," says Gregory Lais, executive director of
Wilderness Inquiry, a Minneapolis-based adventure-travel
organization for the disabled. "There needn't be a conflict
between access for the disabled and preservation of
wilderness."
   No one expects the question to be settled soon or the
bitterness to disappear from two sides unwilling to
compromise. "The whole goal of the disabled movement," says
Michael Jenkins, executive director of the Governor's
Commission on Disability in New Hampshire, "is that 20 years
from now there won't be any issues like this."
