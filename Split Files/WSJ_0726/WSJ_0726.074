   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said second-quarter profit
slipped 2.8% from a year earlier, with all the company's
business segments showing declines except its energy
operations.
   The chemical and energy concern posted profit of $694
million, or $1.02 a share, which was in line with analysts'
expectations. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned
$714 million, or $1 a share. The higher per-share profit in
the latest quarter is due to fewer shares outstanding.

   Sales in the latest quarter rose 4% to $9.65 billion from
$9.28 billion.
   Du Pont attributed the drop in profit to weaknesses in the
U.S. economy, where unit volume sales decreased 5%. Outside
the U.S., unit sales rose 6%, almost entirely from gains in
Europe.
   "This lends support to a key goal of expansion in Europe
to double business by the mid-1990s," Du Pont Chairman Edgar
S. Woolard Jr. said in a statement.
   In the latest quarter, the sharpest drop came in
industrial products, where after-tax operating profit fell
15% to $135 million.
