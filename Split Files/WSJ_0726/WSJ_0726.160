   Engelhard Corp. said second-quarter net income rose 20%
largely because of the success of its precious-metals
management business.
   Earnings for the Edison, N.J.-based maker of
specialty-chemical products and engineered materials rose to
$18.2 million, or 41 cents per share, from $15.1 million, or
34 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose
25% to $751.3 million from $603.1 million.

   Orin R. Smith, president and chief executive officer,
attributed the increase primarily to the company's success in
building its industrial business base for precious-metal
materials management services and to favorable conditions in
those metals markets. That business trades in the precious
metals markets for its own account and for
customers'accounts. Together with the engineered-materials
segment, which includes the fabrication of industrial
products using precious metals as raw materials, this
accounts for about 30% of total operating earnings, the
company said.
   Earnings for the first half of 1990 rose 12% to $32.9
million, or 74 cents per share, from $29.5 million, or 66
cents per share. Sales rose 18% to $1.41 billion from $1.19
billion.
