   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. said directors
voted to exempt the company from all provisions of the new
Pennsylvania anti-takeover law.
   The company said the action isn't likely to have any
impact on a current battle over a reorganization plan.
Allegheny, a maker of consumer and industrial products that
is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
has been attempting to fend off Japonica Partners, an
investor group that is trying to gain control of the company.
