   "We continue to expect sales and net income for the full
year to exceed 1989 results," said Norman A. Barkeley,
chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our
commercial aerospace business is strong, and additional
reductions in overhead are being put into effect." In 1989,
Ducommun had net income of $602,000, or 18 cents a share, on
sales of $68.6 million.
   For the first six months of 1990, the company's net income
more than doubled to $896,000, or 27 cents a share, from
$437,000, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Net income for
the year-earlier period included a $456,000 loss from
discontinued operations. Revenue rose 10%, to $37.9 million,
from $34.3 million.
