   MONTREAL -- Minority preferred shareholders of Steinberg
Inc. sued Socanav Inc., asking Quebec's Superior Court to
overturn about 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.04 billion)
in sales of Steinberg's assets by Socanav in the last year.
   Socanav, which is controlled by the Montreal entrepreneur
Michel Gaucher, acquired the food retailing chain last August
for C$1.33 billion, in a bid backed by the financial muscle
of Quebec's Caisse de Depot et Placement. Caisse de Depot,
the province's powerful pension-fund agency, also is named in
the lawsuit, along with key Socanav executives and Steinberg,
now a unit of Socanav.

   The suit alleges that the defendants acted without regard
for the interests of Steinberg and its remaining shareholders
when it began selling the company's retailing assets. The
three issues of preferred shares, which weren't acquired by
Socanav, have fallen in value between 12% and 37% since the
acquisition of Steinberg.
   Among the transactions that the shareholders are asking
the court to declare null and void are the agreement to sell
Steinberg's 50% stake in Lantic Sugar Inc. to Toronto-based
Jannock Ltd. for C$110 million, and the proposed sale of 69
Miracle Food Mart stores to Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co.
of Montvale, N.J., for C$235.5 million, announced last week.
   If the court can't overturn the sales, then the plaintiffs
are asking it to order the defendants to pay C$1.2 billion in
damages to Steinberg and C$86.7 million to redeem the
preferred shares outstanding.
   Steinberg and Socanav said in a statement that the action
forms part of litigation previously threatened by the
shareholders, and that they believe the action to be without
merit. Executives couldn't be reached to elaborate.
