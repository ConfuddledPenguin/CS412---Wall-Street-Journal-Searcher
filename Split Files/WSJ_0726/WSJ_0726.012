   COATESVILLE, Pa. -- Lukens Inc. said it amended its
shareholder rights plan to lower the trigger point.
   Under the revised plan, holders would have a right to buy
the common of Lukens or of an acquiring company at half the
market price if a hostile purchaser obtains 20% of Lukens's
common, rather than the previous 30%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trigger could be lowered to 10% if the board decides
that a purchaser is an "adverse person," with interests
contrary to those of Lukens and its shareholders.
   The steel products company said the changes weren't made
in response to any known effort to take over Lukens.
