   TOKYO -- Some Chinese students in Japan aren't being
granted visa extensions that would allow them to remain in
the country, despite fears they face retaliation in China for
their pro-democracy activities, students and Japanese
human-rights advocates say.
   Meeting with foreign reporters, three students and their
Japanese supporters said four leaders of a pro-democracy
group have been told by immigration authorities that they
must return to China in the next month. About 20 Chinese
students active in the group have been told their
applications would be taken under consideration. But none
have actually received extensions, the students and lawyers
said. Some have been kept for months in an uncertain legal
status, their visas having expired and their renewal
applications classified merely as "pending."

   The Japanese government, along with other developed
nations, "said it would protect students after Tiananmen,"
said Katsutoshi Fujimori, an attorney representing Chinese
students in Japan. "But it doesn't look like they plan to
really honor that promise." Chinese soldiers who cleared
pro-democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square in Beijing in
early June 1989 killed hundreds of students, workers and
others there and in other parts of the Chinese capital.
   Japanese officials say they are standing by a pledge, made
after last year's summit of industrial nations in France, to
give pro-democracy Chinese students favorable treatment
within the framework of Japanese immigration law. A section
chief in charge of residence issues in the Justice Ministry's
immigration agency said most extension applications are being
processed within three months. And he said applicants with
documentation of continued student status have received
extensions, though he couldn't say how many.
   More than 11,000 Chinese entered Japan in 1989 to study,
according to the immigration official. About 65 students last
year asked for visa extensions for political reasons, a
Foreign Ministry official said.
   Unlike the U.S. and some other countries, Japan hasn't
granted a general right for Chinese students to stay.
Instead, authorities here have insisted on treating Chinese
applicants' cases individually. The immigration official
wasn't available to comment on the cases of students at the
news conference.
   Japan has been criticized by humanrights advocates for its
inhospitality toward political refugees. Many Japanese fear
that open immigration could disrupt the country's social
harmony.
