   Job Networks Strain
   Under Excess Demand

   ONE OF THE BEST ways to find a job is networking: touching
base with colleagues, clients, friends and relatives.
   But many networks are straining these days as corporate
cutbacks swell a trickle of calls into a torrent. "Whenever I
go out, I get deluged," says Diane Durham, an associate
director at Cable News Network. People "want career advice,
job leads, references."
   Many contacts say job seekers are stretching the limits.
"I'm getting calls from strangers, not acquaintances or
friends," says Daniel Collins, a communications director at
Andersen Consulting in Chicago. Of a dozen recent networking
calls, only four were from callers he knew. Susan Rebell, a
vice president in New York with Decision Research, adds,
"I've never gotten so many irrelevant resumes."
   Networking "has been abused, misused and mislabeled," says
Sheryl Spanier, a senior consultant in New York with the
outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. "Cold-calling
people is different from networking." She suggests offering a
contact something in exchange, such as industry information
or the prospect of help later. Public-relations consultant
Byron Reimus, who is "actively helping" three or four people
job search, hopes "that if they find something, they'll
remember me" by steering projects his way.
                                                                                                       

   Headhunters Find
   Livelihood in Niches
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYERS IN NEED of an ornamental horticulturist, an
expert in anti-submarine warfare or a sales manager versed in
the doggie bed market can probably find specialized
headhunters to help them.
   While the big executive-search firms pride themselves on
being able to fill any position for anyone at any time,
smaller companies are carving out the tiniest of markets.
"Nouveau niche," David Lord, managing editor of Executive
Recruiter News, a trade publication, calls them.
   Brakke &amp; Associates, for instance, conducts searches in
the animal and veterinary business. "It's a small industry,"
says Monty Allen, an associate with the Dallas firm, which
recently located a sales manager for an overseas firm
entering the pet-shop supply business. McCabe &amp; Schwartz, New
York, specializes in placing lawyers with pension-law
expertise. "I don't have many competitors," says Carole
Schwartz, the firm's chairman.
   For many, the search business is an outgrowth of an
earlier career. Robert Zahra long managed a Florida fern
cooperative that supplied foliage to florists. Today, he's
general manager of Florapersonnel, De Land, Fla., which finds
estate gardeners, greenhouse supervisors, and managers for
botanical gardens.
   For others, the field is a sideline. Robert W. Dingman
Co., Westlake Village, Calif., does searches in the
health-care, airline, hotel and consumer-products fields. But
one-tenth of its business is devoted to searching for heads
of religious groups and missions. "We are Christians who are
active in our faith," says partner Bruce Dingman. Searches
for religious personnel, he says, "tend to be more painful"
than ordinary business quests. "A charismatic leader {may}
have presence and speaking ability, but not necessarily a
comparable administrative ability."
                                                                                                       

   An Executive Seminar
   On Chasing Quality Prize
                                                                                                       

   THE MALCOLM Baldrige quality award program, now entering
its third year, has become an obsession at many companies.
They sink huge sums into programs to boost their chances.
Consultants promise winning advice. Now a business school has
joined the fray.
   Northwestern University's Kellogg School has developed a
five-day executive seminar, "Creating World-Class Quality,"
that might be mistaken for a how-to course on applying for
the prize. The seminar includes speakers and case studies
from Baldrige-winning companies, a dissection of the
application process and a lecture on selection criteria by
Curt Reimann, the Commerce Department official who directs
the award.
   Mr. Reimann says the goal is learning, not winning. "I
would be personally very uncomfortable in participating in
anything that could be seen as coaching, as opposed to the
larger issue of quality." But he acknowledges that the class
"would be helpful preparation" for applying for the award.
   Nancy K. Hartigan, Kellogg's executive-education director,
adds: "You're talking to the ones who've been through the
battle and won the war." Motorola Inc., a 1988 Baldrige
winner, approached Kellogg with the idea and helped create
the course, which costs $2,900 a person.
   The first session was offered last month, and some 45
managers attended -- nearly twice the usual number for a new
seminar. "We were stunned by the response," Ms. Hartigan
says. So much so that Kellogg plans to offer the course twice
yearly -- and incorporate aspects of it within the school's
M.B.A. program.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYEES VALUE privacy -- except when it comes to drugs.
A poll of over 800 people by the National Law Journal found
that 8% or fewer respondents believed employers should be
allowed secret monitoring of job performance, external
communications or activities outside work. Nearly 75%,
however, favored some mandatory drug testing. . . . It's a
young man's game. A study by Women, Men and Media, a research
group at the University of Southern California, finds that
63% of senior entertainment executives are male; 87% are
under 40 years old.
