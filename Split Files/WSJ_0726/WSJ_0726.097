   Muenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft (Munich Re) AG
said that fiscal 1990 group net profit rose from year-earlier
levels and that the company will leave its dividend unchanged
at 10 Deutsche marks ($6.18) a share.
   The large, West German reinsurance group didn't provide
detailed earnings data, but said premium income from
reinsurance business rose 1.6% to 12.6 billion marks in the
fiscal year that ended June 30 from 12.4 billion marks the
year before

   "Overall, the fiscal 1990 result will prove to be
satisfactory," Munich Re said, adding that the strength of
the Deutsche mark had a negative impact on premium income
development. Without currency translation effects, total
group premium income actually increased more than 4%.
