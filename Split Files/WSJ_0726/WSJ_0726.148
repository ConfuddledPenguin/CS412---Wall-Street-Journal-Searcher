   NEW YORK -- Sales at the two major auction houses exceeded
$5.5 billion in the 1989-1990 art-auction season, a gain of
about 40% for both houses over the year-earlier period.
   The reporting period covers the traditional art auction
season from September 1989 to August 1990. Because
historically no major auctions are held in August, results
include estimates for minor auctions for that month.

   Despite the robust figures, there was some sales weakness
in a few major auctions held in April, May and June. Michael
A. Ainslie, president of Sotheby's Holdings, said there has
been some "stabilization in prices." Art works "fresh to the
market and properly estimated sold well, while those that did
not meet these standards faced greater resistance than in
recent seasons."
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. of New York said that art auction
sales for the 1989-1990 season totaled $3.2 billion, up from
$2.3 billion in the 1988-1989 season.
   Sales at London-based Christie's International PLC were
$2.4 billion, up 40% from the year-earlier sales season.
   Separately, Sotheby's announced plans to open an office in
Berlin in October.
