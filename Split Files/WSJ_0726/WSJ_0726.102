   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers,
perhaps the nation's most prestigious high-tech
venture-capital group, is being haunted by the ghost of a new
machine.
   Kleiner Perkins isn't a likely victim. It has helped
launch scores of high-tech companies, including such major
names as Genentech, Tandem, Lotus, Compaq and Sun, and has
flouted venture-capital conventions. Unlike most investing
outfits, which finance ideas brought to them, Kleiner Perkins
is an entrepreneur factory. It often finances its partners'
own ideas and then lets them staff the new companies.

<TEXT>
   One of those ideas developed into Dynabook Technologies
Corp., a laptop-computer maker. Founded in 1987 by Vinod
Khosla and L. John Doerr, Dynabook had all the makings of a
classic Kleiner Perkins triumph.
   The two Kleiner Perkins partners are among the savviest
high-tech risktakers. Mr. Khosla, 35, co-founded two sizable
high-tech companies before turning 30; one was Sun
Microsystems Inc., now the world's largest maker of computer
workstations. Mr. Doerr, 39, helped finance and plot strategy
for both Sun and Compaq Computer Corp., another runaway hit.
He also helped stitch together Symantec Corp., now a large
software company.
   "They are the supermen of Silicon Valley," says Dave
Winer, a Menlo Park, Calif., software entrepreneur.
   And Dynabook's new machine was their brainchild. It was to
be a slim, stylish but powerful laptop computer that they
hoped would help them create another big company. Mr. Khosla
and Mr. Doerr, both with advanced degrees in engineering and
computer science, conceived of the machine themselves. Then,
they hired outsiders to design it, a contractor to make it
and managers to sell it. They also raised $37 million over
three years, making Dynabook one of the best-financed
computer start-ups.
   Also top-drawer were the investors. They included Pierre
Lamond, who has backed many successful chip companies, and
Marc Rossi, a Prudential Insurance unit's venture capitalist
who financed the extraordinarily fast-growing Conner
Peripherals Inc. Mr. Khosla invested $3 million of his own
money, plus $8 million from Kleiner Perkins.
   Despite this endowment, Dynabook has staggered along,
crippled by a remarkable string of mistakes. Its original
design flopped. Its manufacture was botched. And its
management was fragmented and confused even though led by Dan
H. Wilkie, who helped to launch International Business
Machines Corp.'s original personal computer. For nearly two
years, for instance, Dynabook relied on consultants and
outside contractors rather than hiring a full-time
engineering chief. The temporaries hampered recruiting by
making Dynabook look like "a rent-a-company," says Russ Bik,
a former Dynabook executive.
   In the months before Dynabook's problems came to a head,
it pulled some questionable stunts. Its board fired Mr.
Wilkie just before the official product roll-out but, for the
event, had him masquerade as chief executive. By early this
year, Dynabook could keep going only with the help of
$500,000 from a landlord so eager to fill an empty building
that he didn't notice his tenant was crumbling.
   Today, Dynabook is a shell, its staff reduced to about 28
from a high of 140. Its assets -- including a fresh design
for a laptop with a color screen -- are on the selling block,
with Unisys Corp. the most likely buyer at the moment. "Our
goal is to get a substantial portion of the investors' money
back," says a chastened Mr. Khosla. But people close to the
deal with Unisys, which confirms it has struck "an agreement
of intention to purchase" Dynabook, say the sale will yield
only about $5 million.
   Kleiner Perkins's mishandling of Dynabook lends ammunition
to critics of its practice -- avoided by many venture
partnerships -- of hiring professional managers for ventures
dreamed up by its partners. Even Eugene Kleiner, its
now-retired co-founder, agrees it is hard to tell when hired
managers have the requisite passion for a venture because "if
you make {it} tempting enough, everyone becomes an
entrepreneur."
   Dynabook's fall also suggests that, with high tech
increasingly dominated by global companies, venture
capitalists probably won't, anytime soon, reap the bonanzas
common a decade ago. And it makes it clear that
entrepreneurs, not venture capitalists, are crucial to
forging companies. Dynabook got into trouble because "it
didn't have {that} entrepreneur," says Scott Metcalf, now its
president. "It relied on a professional team that came in to
execute someone else's ideas."
   Mr. Doerr insists, however, that some of Dynabook's hired
managers did have an entrepreneurial stake, and he doesn't
see any special lessons in its problems. "This is the one in
four deals that fails," he simply declares.
   From the start, the Achilles' heel of Dynabook was its
technology. Mr. Doerr struck a deal with Nara Technologies
Corp., a San Jose, Calif., firm, to design the laptop. Todd
Morgenthaler, Nara's president, told Mr. Doerr that he had
figured out a way to produce on a single piece of silicon the
main circuitry of IBM's PC AT, then its flagship personal
computer. Even today, producing such a design is difficult,
but the benefits are lower manufacturing costs and lower
power consumption, both big pluses for a new laptop.
Impressed, Mr. Doerr made Mr. Morgenthaler an offer: Build
Dynabook's laptop and receive continuing fees from a
five-year development contract, a seat on the company's board
and a roughly 25% stake in the company.
   Mr. Morgenthaler accepted. In the spring of 1987, Nara
launched into the electronics. By year end, Dynabook wanted
to have a working prototype by mid-May 1988, with the
product's introduction at the mammoth Comdex trade show in
Las Vegas that fall.
   But the plan unraveled. Mr. Morgenthaler became distracted
by a brother dying of cancer. Nara couldn't complete a
video-graphics device that controls the laptop's display
screen; Dynabook had to buy it elsewhere. Nara's single-chip
design and a so-called glue chip that was to hold together
the circuitry never worked, either. Dynabook scrapped
virtually all of the work Nara did during some 18 months.
   In the end, "everything {Nara supplied} had to be redone,"
says Joseph Sarubbi, who designed IBM's highly successful PC
XT and joined Dynabook full time in January 1989 as chief
engineer.
   Although Mr. Morgenthaler concedes he faced unexpected
difficulties, he says Nara's designs would have worked if
only Mr. Doerr had given him more time. But in early 1989,
Nara was essentially dismissed, he says, adding: "I was
treated like hired help."
   That wasn't the end of Dynabook's design troubles,
however. After introducing the laptop in July 1989, Dynabook
discovered a problem with the power supply. Then, after
manufacturing began, scores of small but irritating design
errors turned up, forcing many revisions. "The number of
changes was far greater at that point in the production
process than you would have expected," says Mr. Bik, who
oversaw Dynabook's materials and facilities for eight months
in 1989.
   The final blow came last fall. After the computer had been
shipped to dealers, its Japanese-made screen proved
defective. "Customers didn't see a perfect display -- they
saw problems," says Mr. Khosla, who calls these defects
"pivotal."
   Besides the technical glitches, the company's top
executives, hand-picked by Mr. Doerr and Mr. Khosla, failed
to deliver.
   At the heart of the team was Mr. Wilkie, famous for the
success of IBM's PC. After leaving IBM, he oversaw Tandon
Corp.'s entry into the PC field but left Tandon when that
business hit the skids. To Mr. Wilkie, Dynabook was a chance
to run another fast-growing computer company. Mr. Doerr and
Mr. Khosla talked of first-year sales reaching $100 million,
and they told him not to worry about engineering, that Nara
was handling it. In late 1987, he joined Dynabook as chief
executive.
   For four or five months, Mr. Wilkie worked alone. He then
hired a half-dozen consultants, mainly former Tandon
executives, and opened an office near his home in Southern
California, an hour's flight from Nara's offices. By then,
Dynabook still hadn't hired its first engineer, but Mr.
Wilkie was relying on Nara and, anyway, he was busy trying to
raise money. That "took away my attention from the business,"
he recalls.
   Dynabook was initially funded in September 1987 with $1.8
million, mostly from Kleiner Perkins. The next June, Sequoia
Capital, Mr. Lamond's firm, led a $9 million round of
financing, but the money was contingent upon Mr. Wilkie's
meeting certain milestones every six weeks. It was
nerve-racking. "I was within one to two weeks of not meeting
payroll four times," Mr. Wilkie recalls. "You slept with your
eyeballs open a great deal."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Wilkie argued regularly over the
qualifications for Dynabook's first senior engineering
executive. Mr. Wilkie wanted an expert in systems; Mr. Doerr
fought for a specialist in chips. "For about six months, we
went through an exasperating search," Mr. Wilkie says.
   Company directors say such issues exaggerated the weak
points of Mr. Wilkie, who they say is more comfortable
running a large organization and delegating sticky problems
to others. "He's the type of manager who feels spending money
is the way to solve a problem," Mr. Lamond, a director, says.
   For instance, Mr. Wilkie funded numerous duplicate
projects, particularly in engineering. He argues that the
projects were needed as "backups" to Nara's work, but Mr.
Lamond insists that a cannier executive would have conserved
cash by sorting out Nara's problems.
   Another alleged shortcoming: Mr. Wilkie gave in too
readily to his executives' whims. He allowed Michael
Shabazian, who persuaded ComputerLand Corp. to sell the
untested Dynabook laptop, to work out of an office near his
home in Pleasonton, Calif., an hour from Dynabook's
headquarters. He also allowed Mr. Sarubbi to maintain his
primary residence in Florida even after becoming permanent
engineering chief. (Mr. Wilkie says the only way to hire the
two men was to permit such arrangements. He adds that he
planned to consolidate Dynabook's operations "at some
point.")
   Even in the area of manufacturing, his specialty at IBM,
Mr. Wilkie slipped. To build Dynabook, he hired SCI Systems
Inc., a contract manufacturer in Huntsville, Ala., that he
had worked with while at Big Blue. Besides trusting SCI's
executives, Mr. Wilkie says he chose SCI because it advanced
Dynabook a multimillion-dollar credit line.
   But relying on a distant manufacturer proved troublesome
when the laptop's design was being revised. Strangely, SCI
had a plant near San Jose, but Mr. Wilkie didn't use it
because it was too small to handle anticipated volumes.
   That arrangement, which SCI won't discuss, later hurt
Dynabook. SCI had such a hard time building the computer,
partly because of numerous design changes, that "we were not
confident enough in SCI's outgoing quality to send the
products directly to customers," Mr. Bik says. "So, all units
were coming to California, and we were testing them again."
   While SCI was ramping up production, Mr. Wilkie, ever
hedging his bets, was paying a consultant $20,000 to
determine the best location to build the product.
   Mr. Wilkie also signed a contract giving SCI the right to
tack its profit margin on top of its costs. Dynabook
executives say the deal gave SCI little incentive to hold
down costs. But Eugene Sapp, SCI's president disagrees,
saying he insisted on the proviso because he anticipated some
of the production snafus that lay ahead. From the beginning,
he says, "the product was not mass-producible" because
Dynabook tried to pack "too many technical innovations" into
it.
   In the midst of all this, Mr. Wilkie's spirit was
flagging. In March 1989 -- just as Dynabook was about to
close on $11 million in new venture money -- he was
approached by an executive recruiter seeking to interest him
in a position at Apple Computer Inc. Mr. Wilkie was curious,
but before pursuing the post he went to Mr. Khosla and Mr.
Doerr. "They both, without exception, indicated how the
company would fall apart if I left," says Mr. Wilkie, who
decided to stay put. (Mr. Khosla denies this. "I never
encouraged Dan to stay. That's nonsense," he says.)
   Three months later, Mr. Wilkie was out of a job. At a
board meeting June 8, Mr. Khosla was installed as president,
though Mr. Wilkie got until July 15 to arrange his departure
terms. Indeed, his exit was a condition of further venture
funding; the directors even turned down his offer to go to
Huntsville for three months to sort out manufacturing
glitches. "We invested in Dan Wilkie, and we made a mistake,
a terrible mistake," Mr. Lamond says.
   In his defense, Mr. Wilkie insists he was betrayed by
Messrs. Khosla and Doerr, saddled with a botched product and
forced to embrace a series of quick fixes, rather than
fundamental changes, to keep Dynabook's doors open. After
hitting serious problems, "we continued to measure progress
in six-week increments . . . instead of saying what can be
done in six months," Mr. Wilkie says. "But each time I said
that, Khosla and Doerr said, `In that case, Dynabook is going
to crash and burn.'"
   The timing of Mr. Wilkie's departure was bad, however.
With Dynabook planning to introduce its long-delayed computer
in less than two weeks, news that he had been fired could
only detract from its debut. So, Mr. Khosla, Mr. Doerr and
Dynabook's other directors decided to lie about Mr. Wilkie's
status to the press, industry analysts and Dynabook's own
employees. And Mr. Wilkie played along, portraying his role
at Dynabook as important and touting the company's prospects.
   As Mr. Wilkie's fate was being decided, Mr. Shabazian,
Dynabook's second-ranking executive, flew to Philadelphia.
The next day, Mr. Shabazian accepted a job as chief operating
officer of Intelligent Electronics, a national computer
retailer. "John {Doerr} was trying to put the squeeze on me
to stay," Mr. Shabazian says. "He didn't need two of his key
guys to leave at once." Mr. Shabazian announced his own
resignation at Dynabook's product introduction on June 20 in
New York.
   Mr. Wilkie says he kept quiet about his firing to spare
Dynabook further embarrassment -- and to help him obtain a
severance package that would pay him $15,000 a month for
nearly a year. He also says he thought he could persuade
Dynabook's board to reverse its decision or at least make his
exit "more controlled."
   That was wishful thinking. Soon, Dynabook's employees
learned of the situation. "I found out at the {product}
announcement that they'd let Dan go -- I was shocked," Mr.
Sarubbi says. "In my mind, you don't wait until announcement
time to terminate somebody."
   Mr. Khosla admits Dynabook's board erred in not disclosing
Mr. Wilkie's departure straightaway. "That's probably our
mistake," he says. But "it should have been clear to people,"
he argues, that Mr. Wilkie's days were numbered when he, Mr.
Khosla, assumed the presidency.
   With Mr. Wilkie gone -- he now is president of Solbourne
Computer Inc., a private company in Longmont, Colo. -- Mr.
Doerr and Mr. Khosla felt the full weight of Dynabook's
problems. They hustled in a new cast of executives, but even
the new people were mystified as to how the two renowned
venture capitalists could have let Dynabook slip so badly.
"Because I had worked with Doerr and Khosla at other
companies, I was amazed that they would allow this to occur,"
Mr. Bik says.
   Even worse, the company was again running out of money.
Mr. Doerr and Mr. Khosla were hunting for prospective
investors as well as employees. In September, they collected
$7 million from a half-dozen venture firms, including $3
million from Prudential's venture arm. Montgomery Securities
kicked in $1 million; so did Goldman Sachs, which only six
months earlier had invested $4 million in Dynabook.
   None of the September investors would comment on their
decision to invest in Dynabook, but people familiar with
their thinking say they were swayed by Mr. Khosla's and Mr.
Doerr's optimism. That wasn't idle chatter. Kleiner Perkins
added $3 million to the deal, and Mr. Khosla personally
plunked down $1.1 million.
   Investors also were influenced by the involvement of James
Lally, who was known for his ability to turn around
companies. Mr. Lally became Dynabook's chief operating
officer in June.
   But to the investors' disappointment, Mr. Lally was active
in Dynabook for only a short time after the financing was
closed. (He couldn't be reached for comment.) Mr. Khosla
decided to ship Dynabook's laptop in November, but by then
Compaq had unveiled a new portable that was winning raves.
   The ComputerLand dealers, who had signed on months earlier
to sell Dynabooks, were gloomy. "All of our {salespeople}
were trained, but by the time we got the product, people had
lost interest in it," says Jeffrey Inwood, who has four
ComputerLand stores in Michigan.
   And then Mr. Khosla left the daily running of the company
in order to attend to other investments. Replacing him was
Bernard Lacroute, another Kleiner Perkins staffer who had
recently left Sun, where he had been the second-ranking
executive. Mr. Lacroute, himself a temporary, hired Harold L.
"Sparky" Sparks, also between jobs, to launch a new marketing
campaign. Mr. Sparks spent much of Dynabook's remaining cash
on a blitz of television commercials.
   It was Dynabook's last gasp. Few customers wanted the
laptop; those that did were put off by the newly discovered
defects in its screen. Mr. Lacroute decided to stop selling
the laptop and concentrate on designing future machines from
scratch.
   Even then, however, Mr. Khosla and Mr. Doerr were able to
raise more money for Dynabook. On Dec. 7, they obtained $3
million from the Economic Development Board of Singapore.
Though Dynabook was within days of missing its payroll, the
Singaporeans believed their involvement "would enable
Dynabook to have access to cost-competitive manufacturing in
Singapore and to expand its marketing into Europe and the Far
East," says Kris Leong, an executive at the agency.
   Although some observers think the Singaporeans were
misled, Mr. Khosla says they "were given a clear indication
of Dynabook's condition." Ms. Leong agrees, saying her agency
was well aware of Dynabook's "high risks."
   Yet when the agency's representative discovered just how
high those risks were, he wasn't amused. Attending his first
board meeting Dec. 19, Lit-Cheong Chong snapped, "We Far East
Asian investors aren't here to be milked."
   And in January, Dynabook's future landlord forked over
$500,000 in much-needed cash -- not as an investment but as
an inducement for Dynabook to move into a new office (which
it vacated July 1). On Feb. 13, Mr. Lacroute laid off most of
Dynabook's workers. Then, in May, Unisys, which wants to
build Dynabook's color laptop, advanced the company enough
money to meet its payroll, and it chipped in further cash in
July when it agreed to consider buying the company. Now, a
team of Unisys executives are deciding whether to complete a
purchase of Dynabook, scutinizing the company's operations
and, says a Unisys spokesman, "looking for any skeletons in
the closets."
