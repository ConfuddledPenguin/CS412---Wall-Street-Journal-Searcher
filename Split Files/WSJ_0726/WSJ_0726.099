   NEW YORK -- Stocks rebounded as investors started to scoop
up beaten-down shares, switching into previously neglected
industry groups.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 8.42 to 2930.94.
New York Stock Exchange volume of 163,530,300 shares was the
lightest in four days. Advancing issues on the Big Board
outpaced decliners, 895 to 583.

   Oil stocks tanked. Mary Quinn, oil stock analyst at S.G.
Warburg, said investors were taking profits on the group,
especially with meetings of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries under way. Chevron fell 1 to 77 3/4, and
Exxon dropped 3/8 to 49 5/8. Ms. Quinn issued a sell
recommendation on Mobil, which fell 1 to 66. Mobil "is a
little expensive relative to the group and its prospects,"
she said. Ms. Quinn restated a buy recommendation on Atlantic
Richfield because she thinks the value of certain assets
haven't been appreciated. Atlantic gained 1/4 to 125 3/4.
   Despite the sell-off in major energy issues, a 1 1/2-point
rise in Alcoa to 69 1/8 and a 1 3/8-point gain in Boeing to
58 1/4 helped lift the industrial average to a second
consecutive gain.
   Dozens of other metals stocks climbed yesterday, and some
investors seem to be making a bet that inflation will surge
again, said Robert Devine, head of equity trading at UBS
Securities Inc. Phelps Dodge gained 1 3/4 to 69 1/8, for
example.
   Stocks coming back to life yesterday after previous
earnings-related routs included Capital Cities/ABC, which
gained 12 1/8 to 545 1/8; Storage Technology bounced 1 1/8 to
27 1/8.
   However, the earnings surprise blood-letting started again
in other shares. L.A. Gear tumbled 2 1/8 to 23 on fears of
weaker-than-expected earnings.
   Sellers circled around Digital Equipment yesterday morning
after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $2.11 a
share, which included a $400 million charge related to
layoffs and other cost-reduction measures.
   The Big Board flashed a pre-opening indication that the
stock might open 7 1/2 points lower than Tuesday's close. But
buyers flocked to the stock and Digital opened 1/8 higher at
75 5/8 at 9:48 a.m. EDT and traded as high as 78. During the
order imbalance, news services reported that Digital planned
to cut as many as 6,000 jobs, which also helped draw in
buyers, traders said. However, sellers had the upper hand at
the close, and pushed the stock down 5/8 to 74 7/8.
   Other technology issues regained favor: International
Business Machines was unchanged at 114 3/4; Compaq Computer
advanced 2 to 59 3/8; Hewlett-Packard added 7/8 to 45 1/8;
NCR rose 1/2 to 69 and Motorola gained 2 1/8 to 79 3/4.
   Cray Research fell 2 to 45 in the wake of its
second-quarter earnings report. While earnings and revenue
for the quarter were sharply higher than a year earlier, the
company said it expects "flat" revenue for the full year.
   Meanwhile, latest results from Investors Intelligence
showed that 49.6% of participants in their "Sentiment Index"
survey were bullish -- matching the highest reading of the
year. The survey said 34.1% were bearish and 16.3% expected a
correction in the stock market. Many of the forecasts were
made before Monday's market drop.
   Du Pont rose 1/2 to 39 3/8 after issuing its report for
the quarter, which was stronger than generally expected
despite a 2.8% decline in net income. Other chemical stocks
to attract buyers included Union Carbide, which rose 3/4 to
20 as two million shares changed hands, and Monsanto, which
added 3/4 to 51.
   On the other hand, investors continued to dump shares of
Dow Chemical, which lost 3/8 to 52 on 1.8 million shares. The
stock plummeted 5 3/4 Tuesday after the company reported that
second-quarter net fell 50% and that earnings may be softer
in the second half, compared with the first.
   Gerber Scientific plunged 2 7/8 to 10 3/8 after saying it
expects earnings for the six months ending in October to be
significantly lower than in the year-ago period, when it
posted net of 66 cents a share.
   Network Equipment Technologies, which posted a loss for
the fiscal quarter ended last month and announced changes in
its management, dropped 3/8 to 7 3/4.
   Upjohn rose 2 1/8 to 42 7/8 on 1.6 million shares amid a
revival of takeover speculation. The list of rumored suitors
includes American Home Products, Schering-Plough and
Britain's Glaxo Holdings. Also, West Germany's Hoechst was
cited in the latest bout of speculation; a spokesman for its
U.S. unit, Hoechst Celanese, declined to comment, as did
Upjohn.
   General Instrument declined 7/8 to 44 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares after a potential rival bidder to Forstmann, Little &amp;
Co., which has agreed to acquire the company in a leveraged
buy-out at $44.50 a share, disclosed it wasn't interested in
a takeover. Shortly before the close, trading was halted as
the company said neither that party nor another entity to
which it had provided confidential information would mount a
bid.
   Dividend-related trading boosted volume in Chase
Manhattan, which gained 5/8 to 20 3/8 and topped the list of
most active Big Board issues on 4.1 million shares, and
Citicorp, which rose 3/8 to 21 on 3.6 million shares. Both
bank holding company issues both carry hefty dividend yields
and go exdividend this week.
   Two new mutual funds investing overseas, Singapore Fund
and Latin American Investment Fund, closed below the price of
their initial public offerings in active trading. Singapore
Fund fell 1/4 from its offering price to 11 3/4 on 1.3
million shares, or more than one-quarter of the five million
shares sold in the offering. Latin American closed at 14 3/4
on 1.4 million shares; the initial offering of four million
shares was made at $15 each.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.44
to 356.95. Volume totaled 11,200,000 shares.
