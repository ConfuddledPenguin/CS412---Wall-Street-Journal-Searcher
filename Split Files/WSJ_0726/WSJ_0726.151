   Credit Suisse, Zurich, the commercial banking unit of CS
Holding, said that its second-quarter profit bested the poor
performance of the first quarter.
   But the bank said the improvement wasn't enough to prevent
a decline in profit for the first half from a year earlier.
The bank had net profit of 716 million francs ($442.3
million) last year, up 21% from 1988.

   Credit Suisse said its balance sheet rose 0.6% in the
second quarter to 124.4 billion francs, but for the first
half increased 5.7%, despite the decline in the dollar and
the gold price. In the second quarter, loan activity slowed
from the pace of the first quarter.
   In the custom of Swiss companies, the bank didn't provide
specific profit figures, and omitted a full-year forecast.
