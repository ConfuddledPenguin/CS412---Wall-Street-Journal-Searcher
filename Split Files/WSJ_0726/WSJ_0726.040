   NEW YORK -- Brokerage firms soon will have to put the
check in the mail faster when they lose an arbitration case
brought by an investor.
   This is because an arbitration rule-making group, spurred
by a rise in complaints from investors who say they have
waited as long as 90 days to collect, is prodding the firms
to accelerate payment.

   Take Edward Strehlau. He won $6,000 in an arbitration case
from Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in April. Weeks rolled by
with no sign of the money. Early this week, he finally
received the check -- mistakenly made out to his lawyer.
   "You wait and wait and wait," Mr. Strehlau, an unemployed
salesman, says, "and then you end up losing all the
interest."
   Under new rules approved by the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration, most major arbitration forums will
soon require securities firms to pay investors within 30 days
of an arbitration decision. Until now, there hadn't been any
strict guidelines on how quickly firms had to pay.
   Most of them typically pay within 90 days, which is their
time limit to move to have decisions set aside. This period
won't be changed.
   Firms still could delay payment for as long as 90 days,
but only if they filed a challenge within a month after the
award was ordered. As a result, industry self-regulatory
groups believe they will be in a better position to take
enforcement action against any foot-dragging firms.
   "It's really the coercive value of having regulators
hopping on delinquent payments that's most effective," says
Richard P. Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration
Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter.
   Payments have been delayed in part because brokerage firms
have been swamped with a heavy arbitration caseload in recent
years. But they also have benefited from paying late, because
they weren't required to tack on interest when mailing these
checks to investors.
   The newly issued directive from SICA, an ad-hoc group that
proposes arbitration rules, will prod most arbitration forums
to require securities firms to pay interest on awards from
the date they are issued. This will give the firms added
incentive to make the payments to investors quickly.
   The upshot: Customers will see their money faster. And
this, legal specialists say, will help build confidence in a
system that is supposed to be far speedier than going to
court.
   Some arbitration forums already have tough payment
guidelines. The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which
handles municipal-bond cases, last year began requiring
brokerage firms to pay investors within 20 days of an award.
Even if a firm disputes an award, it still must put the
amount in an escrow account.
   Board officials say they decided to act, after a few small
firms delayed paying investors because they knew they were
soon going to be out of business.
   "It appears that a number of dealers don't pay arbitration
awards until the very end of the appeal period, even when
they have no intention of bringing an appeal," the board
stated before adopting the rules.
   The SICA also has approved other rules that most
arbitration forums will soon adopt. Some fees beyond the
award, such as forum fees, must be paid immediately following
the arbitrators' decision.
   And investors will be able to join in filing arbitration
cases with others who have similar complaints, such as
disputes arising out of similar transactions involving a
securities firm or broker. To file such a joint case until
now, a direct relationship has had to be shown among the
claimants, such as being members of the same investment club.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers and the New
York Stock Exchange, which together handle more than 90% of
all arbitration cases, say investors won't have to wait long
to feel the effect of the new rules. The NASD says it will
approve them by autumn. The Big Board hopes to approve them
in the next several weeks.
