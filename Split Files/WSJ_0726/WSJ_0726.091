   Phillips Petroleum Co. said it signed a contract with
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., Tokyo, for the
construction of two liquefied natural-gas vessels. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   The Bartlesville, Okla., energy concern said the
87,500-cubic-meter capacity vessels will replace the older,
smaller-capacity, Arctic-Tokyo and Polar-Alaska vessels that
currently transport liquefied natural gas from Kenai, Alaska,
to Japan.

   Phillips holds a 70% stake in the Kenai operations, with
Marathon Oil Co. holding the remaining 30% interest. Marathon
is a unit of USX Corp., Pittsburgh. The vessels are scheduled
to be delivered in mid and late 1993.
