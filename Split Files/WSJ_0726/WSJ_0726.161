   NEW YORK -- The bond market gained strength yesterday from
a weaker-than-expected economic report and more tough
anti-inflation talk from a Federal Reserve official.
   The economic report, released by the Commerce Department,
showed that orders for "big-ticket" factory products declined
a seasonally adjusted 3.2% in June after rising 4.2% in May.
The latest report reveals that manufacturers of cars, home
appliances, industrial machinery and other durable goods are
still hurting.

   Such news tends to stimulate excitement in the bond market
because investors assume that slow growth will eventually
lead to lower inflation and interest rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/8 points, a
gain of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
Short-term Treasury notes and bills, however, ended unchanged
to slightly higher while corporate and mortgage-backed bonds
rose modestly.
   But municipal bonds were top performers yesterday, posting
gains of as much as 5/8 point. Joel Marver, chief
fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group,
said the gains in municipals are a positive sign that the
tone in the broader bond market may be improving.
   "Munis tend to move a little quicker than Treasury bonds,
it's something we're keeping one eye on," he said.
   All bond prices opened higher yesterday in response to the
durable goods report. After the initial flurry of buying
activity died down, the market was lifted again by reports
that Federal Reserve Governor Wayne Angell opposes easing
monetary policy to avoid recession.
   Mr. Angell, who was addressing the American Legislative
Exchange Council in Boston, also said the Fed should "order
its activities so that the interest rates on 30year bonds
would be as low as possible."
   William Sullivan, director of money-market research at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said that Mr. Angell's remarks,
"boosted confidence," in the long end of the bond market by
reinforcing the impression that the Fed still has a resolve
to pursue an anti-inflation policy. In recent weeks, some
investors have worried that the Fed is abandoning the fight
against inflation.
   But the Fed Governor's remarks caused mild confusion for
dealers who participated in the Treasury's record $11.7
billion two-year note auction. Two-year notes, and other
short-term securities, have performed better than long-term
bonds recently due to speculation that the Fed might ease
policy. Many expected that trend to continue and loaded up on
two-year notes at the auction.
   Although dealers said the two-year auction was well bid,
yields for the securities rose slightly after Mr. Angell's
comments hit the news wires.
   The notes were sold at an average yield of 8.07%. That was
the lowest yield at a two-year note auction since 7.71% at
the Dec. 19, 1989 auction and was down from 8.41% at the
previous two-year note auction on June 26. The Treasury
received bids totaling $40.49 billion, including $1.58
billion of noncompetitive tenders.
   Late yesterday, the yield had spurted to 8.10%.
   Steve Ricchuito, chief economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd
Securities said that Mr. Angell's comments "caused a little
setback," in the short-end of the market.
   The upshot, said Joseph Liro, vice-president and
money-market economist at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. Inc., is that
"dealers who purchased securities at the auction are
underwater."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury prices were firmer yesterday, although long-term
bonds outperformed short-term issues.
   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
102 5/32, up from 101 24/32 late Tuesday. The issue's yield
fell to 8.54% from 8.57%. Meanwhile, the price of the
existing two-year note ended at about 100 15/32 to yield
8.09% compared with 100 14/32 to yield 8.10% on Tueday.
   Treasury-bill rates were mixed. The discount rate on
three-month bills eased slightly to 7.56% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.79% while the rate on six-month
bills rose slightly to 7.46% to yield 7.84%.
   Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated July 31 and mature July 31, 1992.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   News that troubled Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association
sold its giant junk-bond portfolio for a slight premium to
its market value buoyed the market for junk bonds,
speculative-grade issues that carry low ratings or no ratings
at all.
   The Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift said it agreed to sell
its junk-bond portfolio to a Canadian investor group for $3
billion. The portfolio was valued at $2.93 billion at the end
of March.
   In reaction to the news, most junk bond prices rose
between 1/8 and 1/4 point.
   Meanwhile, corporate earnings reports helped steer
individual junk-bond issues, driving some higher and pushing
others lower.
   Among the high-yield, high-flyers were junk bonds of Magma
Copper Co., which gained on news of strong second-quarter
earnings and higher copper prices. The company's 16.20%
senior subordinated notes rose 1/2 point to close at 103 1/4.
   The 13.25% senior subordinated debentures of USG Corp.,
the Chicago building manufacturer that reported
stronger-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, chalked up 1/2
point to end at 65 3/4.
   Sharply lower second-quarter earnings caused the 13 5/8%
subordinated notes of Stone Container Corp. to fall 3/8 point
to 101 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended steady to 5/8 point higher.
   Benefiting from a lack of supply, tax-exempts were able to
hold onto positive price levels, the first seen in three
trading days.
   Activity during the session focused on dealer trades, with
a smattering of selling by institutions looking for cash to
fund new purchases, traders said.
   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issues of 2018
were 1/4 point higher at 99 3/8 to yield 7.24%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities prices ended with modest gains.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
were up 1/8 point at 99 5/8, as were Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues.
   Meanwhile, the primary market continues to see warm
investor response to new issues. Among those issues are the
$1 billion offering from Chrysler Corp.'s Chrysler Auto
Receivables Corp. unit. That issue is backed by retail
installment contracts on new or used autos and light trucks
and was priced Monday.
   Also due to favorable response, the size of two
outstanding real estate mortgage investment conduit offerings
has been boosted.
   Fannie Mae said it has raised the size of the Series
1990-93 Remic offering it priced July 3 to $750 million from
the original amount of $500 million.
   And the Freddie Mac's FHLMC 188 offering also priced
earlier this month was doubled in size to $1 billion,
according to lead underwriter Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Fannie Mae also announced this session that Salomon
Brothers Inc. has underwritten a new $500 million issue of
Remic securities, backed by 9.5% Fannie Mae mortgage-backed
securities.
   In other primary market news, traders say they expect a
pricing soon through Salomon of $500 million of securities
backed by credit-card receivables in a trust set up by First
Chicago Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, ended sharply
lower yesterday due to a drop in the value of the pound and
concern about inflation.
   The inflation scare was triggered by comments made Tuesday
by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major. He told policy
makers that inflation may be higher in coming months than the
government had hoped.
   His comments raised concern among investors and analysts
that inflation may delay the pound's entry into the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. In reaction,
the value of the pound fell to $1.8085, down from $1.8235
late Tuesday in London.
   British bonds fell as much as 3/4 point. The 11.75% bond
due 2003/2007 fell 3/4 to 101 14/32 to yield 11.52% while the
12% note due 1995 fell 13/32 to 99 19/32 to yield 12.11%.
   In Japan, bonds ended stronger as dealers were forced to
buy the securities to cover short positions. In a short sale,
dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a
profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities.
   Dealers in Tokyo said the bond market appeared to hit
bottom on Tuesday, and with no new reasons to sell, prices
started rising. The short-covering pushed the market even
higher.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was quoted at a price of 86,
up 0.14 point, to yield 7.415. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield was 6.93%, according to
Salomon Brothers Inc.)
