   Rohr Industries Inc. said it reached a follow-on agreement
with European manufacturer Airbus Industrie to supply engine
housing systems for 800 airliners.
   The agreement is valued at more than $1 billion.

<TEXT>
   It calls for Rohr to furnish engine housing, or nacelle,
systems for engines on two models of Airbus airliners, the
A-320 and the A-321, initially in early 1992.
   The A-321 is a stretched derivative of the current
A-320-200 aircraft. Currently, Rohr is supplying nacelle
systems for 200 Airbus A-320 airliners under a 1984 contract.
The follow-on agreement expands the program to cover 1,000
airliners.
   Airbus Industrie is an aircraft manufacturing consortium
owned by Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Airbus of West
Germany, British Aerospace PLC of Britain and Construcciones
Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
   Chula Vista, Calif.-based Rohr designs, manufactures and
supports aircraft engine nacelle systems and parts for
commercial, military and business aircraft.
