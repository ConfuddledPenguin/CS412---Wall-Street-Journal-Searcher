   RON BURTON SOUNDS TOO GOOD to be true -- but he is. A star
running back at Northwestern University and, later, the New
England Patriots (he was the team's first draft choice in
1960), he went on to John Hancock Insurance Co.'s sales force
in 1965 and became a member of the Million Dollar Club, the
All-America of the insurance industry.
   But Mr. Burton's real claim to fame is a list of good
deeds as long as his touchdown return of a blocked field
goal, a 91-yard run that is still a Patriot record.
   Today, Mr. Burton is an executive consultant in John
Hancock's community affairs division, traveling the country
and averaging five or six talks a week, all with the basic
message that "you can accomplish anything if you pay the
price." His record in community services is long -- he
started Pop Warner football in his home city of Framingham,
Mass., and works with Boy Scouts, crippled children, the
blind and other groups. But his pride and joy is the summer
camp for inner-city teen-agers that he runs on his farm in
western Massachusetts.
   The former running back used his savings to buy the
305-acre site in 1985. The "training village," as he calls
it, took in 20 boys the year it opened its gates. Last year,
160 attended three, six-week sessions and this summer Mr.
Burton expects about 140, in two groups. His money does more
than pay for the farm. Only about one in four of the
youngsters who come to his camp can afford the $1,500 it
costs. But if Mr. Burton feels he or she (he also has
sessions for girls) is worth the effort, he raises the money,
either from friends or from his own bank account. ("My wife
thinks I'm a nut," he once commented.)
   Mrs. Burton, nonetheless, helps run the camp along with
the five Burton children and two assistants, one of them a
lay preacher. "Most of the kids are from Boston," Mr. Burton
says, and half are white and half are black.
   What Mr. Burton most wants to give his young campers is a
sense of fellowship. Their fee covers their clothing and
"everybody looks alike," he says. "Most of these kids have
only one parent," he says. "I have two {kids} with no
permanent home and one that doesn't even have an address."
   The routine is rugged. Up at 4 a.m., Mr. Burton leads his
charges on an eight-mile run to start the day. Following the
Pledge of Allegiance, the schedule moves to sports --
basketball, baseball, soccer -- plus classroom instruction,
until lights-out at 7:30 p.m.
   Mr. Burton's one criterion is that his guests be "good
kids." To him, that means no drugs, no drinking, no smoking,
no swearing and none of what he calls "teasing." By that, he
says, "I mean you don't push anybody for any reason at all."
   The work at the camp must be paying off. "I got one kid
into West Point, one into Yale, and one into the Air Force
Academy," Mr. Burton says proudly. His stated wish is "to
reach every kid and to let them share what has been given to
me." This December, Mr. Burton, who has just turned 54, will
be inducted into the College Hall of Fame in New York, a
reward for his years toiling for Northwestern in the 1950s.
During those years, Northwestern went from no victories at
all to a respectable eight win-two loss record in 1958. Ron
Burton can be just as proud of the victories he is winning at
the Ron Burton training village.
