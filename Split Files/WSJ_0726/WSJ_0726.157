   Farley Inc., the cash-strapped holding company controlled
by investor William Farley, said it sold the assets of its
aluminum die-casting operation to an investor group for
$135.5 million in cash, notes and junk securities.
   Farley Inc. said in Chicago that the investor group, led
by closely held ICM Industries Inc., paid $88 million in cash
for the Doehler-Jarvis unit. It also issued Farley a $25
million subordinated note, which pays interest in like
securities for the first two years, and $15 million of other
so-called payment-in-kind debt.

   An additional $7.5 million cash payment "was deferred,"
Farley said in a news release. Officials weren't immediately
available for elaboration.
   Under the sale, Farley Inc. received an equity interest --
whose size wasn't disclosed -- in the partnership that bought
the unit. Farley retains on its books "certain liabilities"
of Doehler-Jarvis totaling $100 million.
