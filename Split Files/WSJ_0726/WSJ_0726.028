   If you don't know who really wants the farm bill the House
is debating this week, economists at Purdue University have
some answers from a survey of farmers in 21 states. Those
with gross incomes of over $100,000 a year were most likely
to support government farm programs. Nearly half of small
farmers, for whom farm programs ostensibly are designed, want
a gradual elimination of subsidies.
