   GORBACHEV THREATENED to use military force to end ethnic
violence.
   In a decree clearly aimed at nationalist ethnic militants,
the Soviet president said he would use force against armed
outlaw groups unless they disband and surrender their
firearms, ammunition and explosives in 15 days, the Tass news
agency said. The ultimatum was Moscow's latest effort to
crack down on the increasing unrest that has killed hundreds
of people in the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan and in
Soviet Central Asia. It also was a tacit admission that
Soviet Interior Ministry troops have been unable to stop
militants from organizing -- at times with what Tass called
"the connivance of local authorities" -- and obtaining caches
of weapons.

   The decree followed a week of detailed reports in the
state-run press of rampages by "terrorists" in the southern
republic of Armenia.

   The Senate denounced Sen. David Durenberger for
"reprehensible" and "unethical" conduct, upholding the
unanimous findings of its Ethics Committee. The Minnesota
Republican was disciplined for violating speaking-fee and
gift limits and for misleading the Senate on real-estate
transactions.

   Diplomatic sources said Iraqi troops will start pulling
back from the border with Kuwait at dawn today prior to
direct talks this weekend to try to solve the two nations'
dispute over land and oil production. The sources credited
mediation efforts by Egyptian President Mubarak and King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia for easing tensions.

   NASA said it expects space-shuttle launch delays of up to
four months because of hydrogen fuel leaks. The agency said
the shuttle Atlantis, which failed a second leak test, will
be taken off the launch pad for repairs. Separately, the
ranking member of the House panel that funds NASA called for
the scrapping of its space station.
                                                                                                       

   A repaired Atlas rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., with a $189 million satellite that will release
colorful chemical tracers so scientists can see the Earth's
magnetic and electrical fields. NASA said the liftoff was
normal. The launch had been delayed three times in less than
a week because of weather and technical problems.

   A Coast Guard judge suspended for nine months the
captain's license of the former skipper of the Exxon Valdez,
which went aground in Alaskan waters last year. Coast Guard
officials earlier in the day dismissed charges of
intoxication and misconduct against Hazelwood after he
pleaded no contest to two lesser charges.

   Supreme Court nominee Souter paid courtesy calls on Senate
leaders while the Bush administration cautioned Democrats
against any attempts to pin down his views on specific
issues, such as abortion and affirmative action, during
confirmation hearings. The Senate hearings are expected to
get under way sometime in September.

   A government study recommended that many hospitals
routinely offer AIDS tests to all patients, especially those
in poor urban neighborhoods, because so many people are
unknowingly infected with the AIDS virus. Some people,
however, feel such testing would raise questions over
confidentiality.

   Researchers said they may have found a way to prevent
kidney inflammations, the main cause of chronic kidney
failure. The therapy would be the first to block the scarring
involved in the inflammations. Chronic kidney failure, which
usually forces patients to undergo dialysis, is rising at an
8% to 9% rate each year.

   The House failed to override Bush's veto of legislation
guaranteeing workers up to 12 weeks annual unpaid leave for
childbirth, adoption or family illness. As expected, the
232-195 vote in favor of the bill fell short of the
two-thirds required to override. Bush had criticized the
bill's "rigid, federal-imposed requirements."

   Louisiana's governor vetoed a bill that would have
required warning labels on recordings that deal with
potentially offensive topics such as drug abuse, sex and
violence. Roehmer said threatened economic boycotts against
the state didn't sway him. He vetoed the bill, he said,
because it infringed on constitutionally protected free
speech.

   Bishop George Carey was named the 103rd archbishop of
Canterbury. He will succeed Robert Runcie, who plans to
retire at the end of January from his post as spiritual
leader of the Church of England and 70 million Anglicans
world-wide. Carey, 54 years old, has been the bishop of Bath
and Wells in southwestern England since 1987.
