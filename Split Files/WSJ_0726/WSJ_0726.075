   Your June 6 page-one article on the costly rivalry between
Borgess Medical Center and Bronson Methodist Hospital in
Kalamazoo, Mich., demonstrates a sad decline in the
responsiveness of some of our most cherished institutions to
the communities they purport to serve. Kalamazoo's situation
is not unique. But let's not forget the role we all have in
subsidizing the internecine behavior.
   If the Kalamazoo businesses truly are fed up with their
hospitals' costly habits, they can encourage their employees
to drive 45 miles north to Grand Rapids in order to enjoy
tremendous savings and top-quality care. This would reward
more-efficient providers with the best prize of all-patient
volume. If the Kalamazoo businesses encouraged effective
health-care shopping, the hospitals quickly would get the
message. Grand Rapids has an expectation that community
interests should prevail over institutional interests.
Shouldn't other communities expect the same? The health-care
system exists to serve the public, not the other way around.
