   It was easy to become a Supreme Court justice in Oliver
Wendell Holmes's day.
   All you had to do was teach at a leading law school, write
compelling treatises, draft scholarly legal opinions and coin
such memorable phrases as "The life of the law has not been
logic; it has been experience."

   Forget Justice Holmes -- he wouldn't even make the short
list today.
   For every lawyer dreaming of a seat on the U.S. Supreme
Court, the rules have changed. The nomination of David
Souter, possibly the lowest-profile nominee in history,
should send thousands of lawyers in search of Wite-Out to
remove entries from their resumes.
   The new canon of how to be appointed to the Supreme Court
includes such directives as:
                                                                                                       

   -- DON'T write law review articles on important legal
issues of the day.
   -- DON'T teach at a law school, where one's ideas are
challenged -- and remembered -- by students and faculty.
   -- DON'T speak on the lecture circuit.
   -- DON'T serve long enough on a federal court to establish
a judicial record that can be scrutinized.
   -- DON'T do or say anything unconventional.
   Judge Souter, who satisfied all the mandatory don'ts -- as
well as winning extra credit for not writing for the law
review while in law school or clerking for an appellate judge
after graduation -- is the ultimate tabula rasa.
   He served on the federal appeals court in Boston for such
a short time that he wrote no opinions, and cases he handled
while on the New Hampshire Supreme Court didn't usually
involve him in constitutional controversies.
   Judge Souter is widely described as a scholar, a label
that seems surprising, says New York lawyer David Boies,
because "ordinarily you think of a scholar as someone engaged
in research and writing and scholarship. The one thing you do
know is that he is not engaged in the activities of a
scholar."
   It's easy to see why such proven judicial scholars as
Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner of the federal appeals
court in Chicago, Amalya Kearse and Ralph Winter Jr. of the
federal appeals court in New York, or Patrick Higginbotham
and Edith Jones of the federal appeals court in New Orleans
didn't make the cut. They didn't follow the revised "rules."
   Those rules are prompting confusion and alarm among the
legal elite.
   Bruce Fein, the conservative legal pundit who recently
predicted confidently that Solicitor General Kenneth Starr
(an inveterate revised-rule breaker with a long record as an
appellate judge and Justice Department official) would get
the nomination, can't say enough bad things about the present
situation.
   "I can't think of any outstanding justices who have come
to the Supreme Court as such a non-entity as Mr. Souter,"
says Mr. Fein.
   Mr. Fein says the new litmus test for appointees appears
to be, "Have you written anything that's challenged the
conventional wisdom? Have you performed as an advocate or a
judge on any important issue? Is your manner of speaking
sharp and pointed, as opposed to phlegmatic?" The correct
answer to all questions is "no."
   Court-watchers say the revised "rules" are, in part, the
product of a still-massive hangover from the divisive battle
in which outspoken conservative nominee Robert Bork failed to
win Senate confirmation in 1987. A rules revision seemed even
more urgent when Judge Douglas Ginsburg withdrew from
consideration after word of his past marijuana use put his
confirmation in jeopardy.
   But legal scholars say the list of don'ts also reflects
the cautious character of President Bush, the close split
between conservatives and liberals on the Court and the
dominance of abortion as a political issue. In addition, with
a Democratic Senate and a Republican White House, key
judicial nominations are likely to be hard fought.
   Judge Souter, a conservative in temperament and judicial
philosophy, without a trace of a record on his views on the
constitutionality of abortion, isn't likely to ruffle
feathers during confirmation hearings. That's particularly
important as this is an election year.
   "The last thing you want in a Supreme Court nominee is a
record," says Alan Morrison, a prominent public-interest
lawyer in Washington. "The Senate can't beat you with
nothing."
   Of course, not all Supreme Court nominees through the
years have had the prior career achievements of Justices
Felix Frankfurter, Louis Brandeis and Holmes. And even some
justices who later became well respected, such as William J.
Brennan Jr., the man Judge Souter is being nominated to
succeed, were little known at confirmation time and didn't
begin with overwhelming credentials.
   For his part, Judge Souter is a Harvard Law School
graduate and former Rhodes Scholar, and he is lauded by New
Hampshire lawyers for his keen legal mind and his quickness
in oral arguments. State bar president John T. Broderick
says, "If you get an opportunity to spend 10 minutes talking
to him about the law, you are in the presence of someone very
special. And if you argue before him, you find he has a
compelling mind."
   Nonetheless, unlike most previous court nominees, Judge
Souter seems never to have expressed himself on any important
legal or philosophical matter -- in any forum. While Sandra
Day O'Connor was a state appeals judge before her nomination
and had never sat on a federal bench, she had articulated her
views on issues as an Arizona state legislator. Anthony
Kennedy, the most recent appointee, wasn't a household name
in legal circles before his nomination, but he had served for
12 years on the federal appeals court in San Francisco and
had taught constitutional law for more than two decades.
   The big question now is whether the new set of rules will
remain in effect when Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry
Blackmun -- both in their 80s -- and perhaps others leave the
court in coming years.
   Lawyers say that if President Bush wins re-election, he
might be more willing to go out on a limb with a judicial
candidate who has ideas, if not skeletons, in his closet.
Judge Souter "certainly looks like a situational appointment
-- defensive in large respect," says Harvard Law School
professor Charles Nesson. "I don't know if that speaks to a
long-term trend. It's a situation that arises before an
election. I suspect things would be different in his second
term."
   For as long as the revised rules remain in effect,
however, lawyers and judges with more obvious credentials are
likely to bemoan the current selection process.
   "There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of hopes were
dashed this week," says Harvard Law School professor Arthur
Miller, "and if it's a signal that being a standout jurist
with a visible record is a liability, that is a very sad
signal."
