   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court threw
out part of a tobacco-liability lawsuit against Philip Morris
Cos. But in a potentially precedent-setting move, the court
allowed plaintiffs to name as a defendant the retail store
that allegedly sold the company's cigarettes to minors.
   The plaintiffs claimed Philip Morris should be liable for
injuries sustained by two minors who bought cigarettes at a
chain of convenience stores. The high court, in granting
summary judgment in favor of Philip Morris, dismissed claims
that the tobacco company should be held liable for the
selling of its cigarettes to minors by convenience stores.

   But the court allowed the plaintiffs to pursue their
claims that the product caused injury -- in this case
nicotine addiction -- because it was "defective" and that
Philip Morris breached an implied warranty that its products
were safe.
   The court didn't raise issue with the naming of Store 24
Inc., the convenience-store chain, as a co-defendant in the
case, although no retailer has ever been held liable in such
a case before, according to legal experts.
   "I think the effect of this is there will be cases brought
against retailers all over. They will now be held accountable
and I think they're going to be in big trouble," said Edward
Greer, attorney for the plaintiffs, Theresa Kyte and Sean
Cann. The suit says the plaintiffs began buying cigarettes at
12 and 15 years old, respectively.
   Mr. Greer said the plaintiffs plan to pursue the remaining
claims against Philip Morris.
   He added that the charge of defect in the cigarettes is
based on, among other things, their high level of nicotine.
   Hadrian R. Katz, an attorney for New York-based Philip
Morris, said he was "very pleased" with the ruling. He
maintained that the court's decision effectively eliminated
the plaintiffs' case against Philip Morris.
   Several previous liability cases against tobacco companies
have been defeated or overturned on appeal. This case is an
important precedent because it is "putting both retailers and
manufacturers on notice that it is not permissible to sell a
lethal drug illegally," asserted Brad Krevor, executive
director of the Group Against Smoking Pollution, or GASP, a
Boston-based advocacy group.
   Mr. Greer said "no one had ever sued a retailer before" in
a tobacco-liability case. He said the ruling didn't exempt
Store 24 from liability, so "when we go to trial, Store 24"
will be a defendant.
   The Massachusetts' ruling may have wider impact as courts
in other states look outside their own borders for precedents
set elsewhere.
   Officials of Store 24, based in Waltham, Mass., couldn't
be reached for comment.
   In its ruling, the Massachusetts court stated that because
"Philip Morris has no control over Store 24 or other
retailers," among other reasons, the cigarette maker hadn't
conspired with the retailer to sell its products illegally to
minors, as the plaintiffs charged.
   In their suit, the plaintiffs' families allege that one of
their children, Theresa Kyte, hasn't been able to stop
smoking Philip Morris cigarettes after six years despite many
attempts to quit. The families charge that Sean Cann, now 20,
also hasn't been able to kick the habit. They further allege
that the minors repeatedly purchased Philip Morris's Marlboro
and Parliament brands at Store 24 convenience stores in
violation of a statute prohibiting sale of tobacco to minors.
   Said Mr. Krevor of GASP: "There are 100 million teen-agers
who become smokers everyday. Invariably, cigarettes are
obtained illegally. The laws against it are not enforced."
This case, he said, could "put teeth in the laws that protect
teens."
