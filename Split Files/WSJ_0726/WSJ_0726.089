   Bethlehem Steel Corp., stung by equipment outages and
higher costs, saw second-quarter profit plunge 74%.
   The nation's second largest steelmaker earned $21.9
million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $84.1 million, or
98 cents a share, a year ago. Last year's results included
$105 million in charges to restructure the company's
BethForge and Baltimore Marine divisions.

   Sales fell 11% to $1.28 billion from $1.43 billion.
   The results, while disappointing, weren't surprising. The
Bethlehem, Pa., concern is relining a blast furnace at
Sparrows Point, Md., which analysts say accounts for 30% of
the company's capacity, as well as modernizing a hot strip
mill and making coke oven repairs. Analysts estimated that
such outages reduced earnings by 40 cents to 50 cents a
share.
   Bethlehem decided last year to conduct major maintenance
programs in 1990, believing it would be a weak year for steel
shipments. However, shipments are stronger than the industry
expected, leaving Bethlehem unable to take full advantage of
the market's current strength. But analysts believe the
present maintenance program, which will continue in the third
quarter and in early 1991, will make Bethlehem stronger in
1991. The Sparrows Point blast furnace resumed full
production in the first week of July, while more hot-strip
mill outages are scheduled for August and early 1991.
   Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst, expects
such outages will cost Bethlehem $125 million in 1990, but
only $60 million in 1991. He noted that the extra costs are
incurred when the company takes down its hot strip mill and
buys slabs from other producers to meet customer orders. In
addition, Bethlehem has higher labor costs because of a new
labor agreement with the United Steelworkers of America,
effective June 1, 1989.
   The company noted that shipments in its basic steel
operations fell 13% in the second quarter, reflecting fewer
deliveries of semifinished steel to other steel producers.
   In spite of the reduced shipments, Bethlehem said orders
are relatively robust because of the stronger-than-expected
automotive market and fewer imports. As a result, the company
doesn't see a third-quarter seasonal decline, but expects to
ship about 2.3 million tons. And in the fourth quarter,
analysts say that Bethlehem could see strong shipments as
nervous customers stock up in advance of labor talks between
the union and USX Corp., the nation's largest steelmaker,
whose union contract expires in January.
   In the first six months, Bethlehem earned $43.2 million,
or 41 cents a share, down from $148.8 million, or $1.73 a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $2.49 billion from $2.84
billion.
   Bethlehem shares closed yesterday at $16, up 37.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
