   WASHINGTON -- Congressional allies of the nation's peanut
growers defeated a Senate proposal to dismantle the subsidy
system for the crop, and averted a vote on a similar measure
in the House.
   The showdown on peanuts marked one of many challenges to
farm-subsidy programs that the leadership of the Agriculture
committees has managed to thwart as Congress moves toward
enactment of the 1990 farm bill. Both chambers could finish
their work this week on the $54 billion bill, which sets farm
policy and spending levels for the next five years.

   In a crucial vote on subsidy limits, farm-bloc lawmakers
led by Rep. Kika de la Garza (D., Texas) routed a coalition
of urban Democrats and conservative Republicans, who have
been trying -- with scant success -- to overhaul or eliminate
several commodity programs. The House voted 263-159 against a
proposal to deny subsidy payments to farmers earning more
than $100,000 a year, after Mr. de la Garza denounced it as a
"meat-ax approach" to trimming the farm budget.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate rejected the arguments of
Sen. William Roth (R., Del.) and other Northern senators who
maintained that peanut price supports inflict a hidden tax on
consumers in the form of higher prices for peanut butter and
other products. The 57-41 vote was a triumph for the closely
knit peanut-grower groups and for lawmakers from Georgia,
Alabama and other Peanut Belt states, whose lobbying and
vote-swapping overmatched the efforts of consumer advocates
and peanut processors.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Hatcher (D., Ga.) used a
parliamentary maneuver to keep the House from taking up a
similar amendment by Rep. Dick Armey. The Texas Republican, a
leader of the so-called reform coalition, still hopes to
revive his measure before a final vote on the overall bill.
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) managed to salvage part of
the coalition's agenda last night when he worked out a
compromise with Rep. Charles Stenholm (D., Texas) that would
gradually reduce support payments to wool and mohair
producers. Mr. Schumer had proposed a $50,000-a-year cap on
payments to individual owners of sheep and goat herds. Under
the agreement approved by voice vote, a $200,000 cap would be
imposed in the 1991 marketing year beginning Feb. 1 and
phased down to $100,000 in 1994.
   In the Senate, the peanut-quota system weathered a fierce
attack. Under the system, which dates from the 1940s, the
government limits the number of peanut farmers who can
produce for the domestic market to 44,000 quota holders. The
government sets the support price for so-called quota peanuts
at $631 a ton, about 50% higher than the world market price
and well above the quota holders' production costs. The
support price for so-called additional peanuts grown by
quotaless farmers is $149 a ton.
   Sen. Roth ridiculed the quota system as "one of the last
vestiges of feudalism in the U.S.," and he estimated it cost
consumers $369 million last year through artificially high
peanut prices. But defenders of the program prevailed with
arguments that it provides a steady supply of peanuts,
stabilizes farm income in the Peanut Belt, and operates at
little cost to taxpayers.
   Sen. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) told his colleagues that the
return to peanut growers on an 18-ounce jar of peanut butter
varying in price from $1.33 to $3.19 amounts to only 46
cents. Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) contended that peanut
processors would divert any savings from lower-cost peanuts
into marketing and packaging, rather than pass them on to
consumers. "They want to take the money from the peanut
farmers so they can pay for television advertising for Skippy
peanut butter," asserted Mr. Helms.
   The sharpest clash came in the House debate over denying
cash subsidies and other income supports to farmers with an
adjusted gross income of more than $100,000 a year. Messrs.
Schumer and Armey contended that the proposal would affect
only 20,000 "fat-cat farmers" and would save $4.5 billion
over the next five years.
   But farm-bloc lawmakers carried the day, arguing that the
projected savings were greatly overestimated, if not
illusory, and that the proposal would force farmers who
account for 70% of U.S. farm production out of the farm
program. This could result, they warned, in price-depressing
surpluses of grain and other commodities because these
farmers would no longer be subject to government production
controls.
   Last week, the Senate rejected a call for outlawing
subsidies to farmers with gross sales of more than $500,000 a
year.
   Last night, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) decided against
adding a provision that would have established a mandatory
seafood-inspection program. The proposal would have given the
Agriculture Department the task of inspecting seafood
processors. But Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) and other
Commerce Committee members strongly favor making the Commerce
Department the lead agency. Messrs. Leahy and Mitchell
decided to take up the inspection plan later as a separate
bill, rather than risk a farm-bill filibuster by Sen.
Stevens.
