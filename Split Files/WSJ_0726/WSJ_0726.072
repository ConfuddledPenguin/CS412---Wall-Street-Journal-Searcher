   NEW YORK -- A growing belief that Japan's central bank
won't raise interest rates in the near future helped push the
yen down against the dollar and the mark.
   The dollar flitted above 150 yen several times around
midafternoon in New York and was quoted late in the day at
149.89 yen, up from 148.78 yen the day before. The dollar
also was trading at 1.6250 marks, up from 1.6215 marks late
Tuesday. Sterling stood at $1.8117, down from $1.8133 late
Tuesday.

   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 150 yen soon
after the opening; in Tokyo Wednesday it closed at 149.13
yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6263
marks, up from the Tokyo close of 1.6241 marks on Wednesday.
   The dollar hasn't closed above 150 yen since July 5.
   The yen's slide also sent the mark up past the 92-yen
level, a threshold that triggered customers' orders to sell
yen to avoid further losses, traders said. The yen was quoted
late in the day at 92.24 yen, compared with 91.76 yen late
Tuesday in New York.
   Two waves of activity dominated New York trading, dealers
said. One centered on the dollar, as markets reacted quickly
to comments by Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell in
a Boston speech that he opposes any easing of U.S. monetary
policy at this time. The dollar -- which has been drifting
amid conflicting signals on U.S. rates since Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan referred to a marginal easing of rates two
weeks ago in congressional testimony -- was pushed upward as
traders jumped to buy the currency.
   The Angell comment came as a surprise, said Alexis Egan,
corporate foreign exchange trader at Banque Indosuez in New
York. It was a "comment no one expected from a place no one
expected," she said, and it caused a surge that helped
trigger sell orders against the Japanese currency as the
dollar approached 150 yen.
   But the dollar was on the sidelines for much of the day as
attention was focused on the yen's slide against other
currencies, especially the mark. "Basically, today is a cross
(or non-dollar rates) day and not a dollar day," Kenny
Kimura, an assistant vice president and trader at Sumitomo
Bank in New York, said.
   Mr. Kimura said the yen's slide against the mark in Asian
and European trading was unexpected and triggered sell
orders. He and others cited a growing view among traders that
Japan's central bank won't boost rates soon. Speculation that
Japanese rates would rise had helped boost the yen in recent
weeks.
   Shigeito Yanase, a foreign exchange manager with Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank in Tokyo, echoed other traders when he said the
Bank of Japan may wait until late August or early September
to raise rates.
   Ronald Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago, said attention in the market
now will focus on the first estimate of U.S. second-quarter
gross national product, due for release tomorrow.
   "I think the market is poised fundamentally to lower the
dollar," he said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery jumped $4.10 to settle at $372 an ounce. Estimated
volume was a heavy seven million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold opened for trading at $371.35
an ounce.
