   A surprise decision by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission will delay construction of the Iroquois Gas
Transmission System's pipeline from Canada to the U.S.
Northeast and give the natural gas project's opponents
another chance to state their case.
   Iroquois officials said gas probably won't start flowing
to the energy-hungry Northeast by the scheduled start-up date
of November 1991, but they said the delay likely wouldn't be
significant.

   FERC commissioners, who had been expected to issue a
certificate allowing construction on the 369-mile, $582.6
million project to begin, instead stunned the project's
supporters by ordering a hearing for "public policy" reasons.
The hearing is intended to review the need for the gas and
the project's proposed rate structure.
   The order calling for the hearing means that the fate of
the project won't be decided until late November at the
earliest, commissioners said. The project calls for shipping
about 575.9 million cubic feet of gas daily to the Northeast.
   Edward Sondey, vice president of gas supply, Brooklyn
Union Gas Co., said he was "disappointed and shocked" by the
decision to call a hearing rather than issue a certificate
for the pipeline, adding that the issues surrounding Iroquois
have been "hashed and rehashed" in many different forums in
the last three years.
   "We had counted on beginning service in 1991," Mr. Sondey
said. The New York-based utility, which has an 11.1% stake in
the Iroquois project, is one of the largest customers for the
Canadian natural gas.
   Robert Reid, president of the Iroquois Gas Transmission
System consortium, said that the order will delay
construction of the pipeline, which had been scheduled to
begin in early 1991. Iroquois officials said they haven't yet
determined whether it will affect the pipeline's proposed
start-up date.
   A group of U.S. natural gas producers welcomed the FERC
decision, saying that "approval of the project would not have
been in the public interest." The Independent Petroleum
Association of America, along with other Iroquois opponents,
argues that the need for the project hasn't been demonstrated
and that the proposed rate structure discriminates against
U.S. domestic producers.
   Brooklyn Union's Mr. Sondey said that he met with IPAA
members on four occasions to negotiate a gas-supply contract
before the utility decided to buy Canadian gas. "They weren't
willing to meet our conditions," he said. "The Canadians
were. If (domestic producers) aren't willing to compete, they
should just pack their bags and go home."
   FERC Commissioner Elizabeth Moler, who voted against
holding the hearing, argued not only that there is a
demonstrated need for the project, but that the FERC is
treating Iroquois differently from the way it approaches
comparable U.S. projects.
   While its sponsors remain optimistic that Iroquois
eventually will get FERC approval, other observers, noting
the highly charged atmosphere surrounding the project, are
less bullish.
   "Now we have a new procedure, it creates the potential for
a different outcome than we all originally expected to see:
approval of Iroquois," said Roger Berliner, a Washington
natural-gas market analyst.
   A $2.2 billion expansion of Trans-Canada PipeLines Ltd.'s
main line, needed to transport the gas to the U.S. border, is
also bogged down by separate regulatory issues in Ottawa.
Canada's National Energy Board is expected to rule on the
Trans-Canada project by year end.
