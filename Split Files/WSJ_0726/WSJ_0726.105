   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. said its pending $7 billion
refinancing package would have trimmed its interest costs
about 10% for this year's first six months to $1.46 billion.
   The tobacco and food company is retiring substantial
amounts of its high-cost debt, including more than $4.4
billion of high-yield, below-investment-grade "junk" bonds.
RJR is financing the transaction with bank loans, a new issue
of convertible preferred stock, and a $1.7 billion equity
infusion from its principal shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.

   In formal exchange-offer documents filed yesterday, RJR
said its refinancing plan is intended to "improve the
creditworthinesss" of the highly leveraged company. Had the
refinancing plan been in effect, RJR said that because of
lower interest costs, its $330 million loss for the first
half would have shrunk to $216 million before preferred
dividends.
   RJR also said that its debt-to-equity ratio, which stood
at 24 to 1 June 30, would have dropped to 4 to 1 under the
recapitalization, if preferred stock were counted as equity,
or 8 to 1 if preferred were counted as debt.
   RJR also disclosed more details about negotiations earlier
this month to reset the interest rates on its bonds maturing
in 2007 and 2009: RJR said its investment banker, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., had recommended new rates of 16 1/2% and 17%,
respectively. But two other investment banks acting on behalf
of bondholders, Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
had called for rates of 17 1/2% and 18%, respectively.
   When the three investment banks couldn't reach agreement,
the issue was settled July 15 by the investment bank
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. It picked rates
of 17% for the bonds of 2007 and 17 3/8% for the bonds of
2009. The rates are intended to make sure that the bonds
trade at their full face value.
