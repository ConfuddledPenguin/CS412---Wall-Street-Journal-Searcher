   PARIS -- Airbus Industrie said it received firm orders for
four of its A310-300 commercial jets from Air Afrique, which
also took options on four additional aircraft.
   The European aircraft consortium said delivery of the
planes will begin in the summer of 1992. The aircraft will be
configured to carry 187 passengers in three classes and will
be powered by CF6-80C2 engines made by General Electric Co.,
Fairfield, Conn.

   Financial details weren't disclosed, although industry
sources estimate the price of one A310-300 without spare
parts and training at slightly less than $70 million.
