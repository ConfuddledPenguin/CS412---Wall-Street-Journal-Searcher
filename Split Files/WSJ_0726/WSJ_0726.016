   Will the U.S. have a "minority majority" by the year 2050?
So Time magazine, among others, has said. And if it is true
that before long English-speaking whites will be outnumbered
by blacks, Asians and Hispanics, it follows that the ebbing
white majority must act now to improve the lot of the current
ethnic minorities. If whites uplift and empower the new
majority before it takes over, it will be nicer to whites
once it's in the driver's seat.
   To the historian, such talk has a familiar ring. At the
beginning of this century, a great many Americans of native
stock worried that they would be swamped by the massive waves
of European immigration breaking on our shores, and the even
more massive families they were creating. One worrier
calculated that after 200 years 1,000 Harvard men would have
left only 50 descendants, while 1,000 Romanian immigrants
would have produced 100,000. There goes the neighborhood.
These fears of "race suicide" lay behind the legislation to
cut off the flow of new immigrants that passed Congress by
overwhelming majorities in the 1920s.

   The theory of the emerging minority majority is simply the
old race suicide theory with a twist. The old fear-mongering
incited Americans to guard the gates more vigilantly, to keep
out the rabble. Now similar population projections are
trotted out as evidence of the need for bigger and better
social programs. Don't try to keep Genghis Khan out of the
country; just make sure his kids are enrolled in Head Start.
   If something can be done to integrate minorities into
American life more smoothly, it should surely be done. But
not on the basis of a theory built on sand. Demographers, it
must be recalled, have never been much good at prediction,
and competent ones these days do not profess to be. In the
1930s, population experts were unanimous in foreseeing a
sharply declining population in the U.S. and other industrial
societies. Not one predicted the postwar Baby Boom or the
resumption of mass immigration to these shores. Instead of
declining in the past half century, the American population
has almost doubled. Demographers project future populations
on the basis of currently observable patterns of fertility,
mortality and migration. The more remote the future, the
greater the possibility that these patterns will change, and
the more susceptible they are to being changed by public
policy.
   For example, the fertility rate for black women is
currently about 30% higher than that for white women, with an
average of 2.3 expected births per woman vs. 1.8 for whites.
This differential has been shrinking: It was 33% in the late
1950s and 37% as late as 1965. A 30% fertility differential
on the part of a small minority does not result in dramatic
changes in group size, particularly when the group also has
above-average mortality rates.
   As a result, the black share of the population has not
grown fast. It was 9.9% in 1920, 10.0% in 1950, 11.1% in 1970
and is expected to be a bit over 12% when the returns of the
1990 census are in. (Of course we know that the census-takers
are unable to provide a fully accurate count of blacks, but
there is no reason to believe that the undercount was less in
earlier enumerations. If anything, the undercount was
probably smaller in recent censuses, since the problem has
been recognized and efforts have made to overcome it.)
   The diminution of black-white fertility differentials
reflects the rising educational levels of blacks and the
growth of a black middle class. The diminution is likely to
continue if those trends continue. Even if they do not, at
their current growth rate blacks will remain a small fraction
of the population even a century hence.
   The Asian population of the U.S. has been growing at a
spectacular rate since the 1965 immigration reform purged the
law of the anti-Asian biases that had infected it since the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The growth, however, has been
almost all attributable to immigration: The major Asian
groups in the U.S. -- Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and
Filipinos -- are not notably fecund. If the proportion of
Asians in the population did rise so precipitously as to
constitute a great "problem" in the eyes of most Americans,
therefore, the solution would be quite simple. The flow could
be cut back easily, by modifying the immigration law.
   The dramatic growth of the Hispanic population over the
past three decades has been the result both of heavy
immigration from Central and South America, Mexico and the
Caribbean, and of the generally high fertility of Hispanic
immigrants and their children. There is great diversity among
the various groups included under the Hispanic label,
however. Cubans, for example, have a lower fertility rate
than native American whites do, and many other Hispanic
groups do not have conspicuously large families.
   According to the 1980 Census, the most fecund Hispanic
groups -- Mexicans and Puerto Ricans -- had fertility rates
that exceeded those of whites by 39% and 35% respectively,
and those of blacks by 9% and 6%. A significant differential,
but hardly an earth-shaking one, far smaller than the gap
between the fertility of native-born Americans and many
European immigrants groups at the turn of the century.
   Anyway, Hispanics born in the U.S. have fewer children
than their immigrant parents, and their children have fewer
still. In 1980 the fertility rate of native-born Americans
whose parents were born in Mexico was 15% below that of
Mexican immigrants; for Puerto Ricans born on the mainland
the generational fertility drop was 37%. With rising levels
of education Hispanic distinctiveness diminishes further. The
fertility of second generation Mexican-American high school
graduates is only 6% above that of non-Hispanic whites with
equal schooling. For those with some college, the difference
is only 1%. Second generation Mexican-Americans with college
degrees have 7% fewer babies than non-Hispanic white women
with the same educational attainments.
   There are two glaring flaws in the minority-majority
theory. With assimilation, high fertility immigrant groups
adopt native reproductive patterns. Theorists of "race
suicide" assumed that once a Romanian, always a Romanian,
even unto the third and fourth generation. They were utterly
wrong, not least because with each passing generation a
growing proportion of the descendants of the immigrants
married people of different backgrounds. It continues to
happen. A good many second-generation Hispanics now marry
"Anglos," and an even higher fraction of their children do.
   The second fallacy is the assumption that immigration will
continue at its present levels and will be governed by the
same entry criteria that have produced the current mix of
groups. Since 1965 U.S. immigration law has given
overwhelming priority to "family unification"; nine out of 10
entrants now come in on that basis. This, in effect, strongly
discriminates against prospective entrants from countries
that have been behind the Iron Curtain for a generation, and
favors groups like Mexicans, who have an abundance of
relatives already on the scene. Giving less priority to
family considerations and more to the possession of skills in
short supply in the American economy would bring in fewer
Mexicans and more Czechs and East Germans. That may or not be
desirable. The point is that the system could easily be
changed if there were a will to do so.
   Not only could the composition of the current immigrant
stream be substantially modified. The size of the total flow
could be greatly reduced if Americans became convinced that
immigration was producing undesirable changes in their social
order. The legislation of the 1920s depressed levels of entry
from Eastern and Southern Europe far below what they would
have been had the door remained open. And there is good
evidence that even the fairly mild restraints introduced by
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 substantially
cut down the flow of illegal entrants.
   If today's immigrants assimilate to American ways as
readily as their predecessors at the turn of the century --
as seems to be happening -- there won't be a minority
majority issue anyway. Whatever their origins, they will have
joined the American majority, which is determined not by
bloodlines but by commitment to the principles for which this
nation stands.
