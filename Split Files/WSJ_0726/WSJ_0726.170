   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp., in
separate moves, announced further retrenchments in the face
of falling North American vehicle sales.
   Chrysler said it will permanently close a small Canadian
Jeep plant in 1992, and consolidate all Jeep production in
Toledo, Ohio. In addition, Chrysler indicated that in two
years it will discontinue two slow-selling midsized models
engineered by Renault S.A. and assembled by Chrysler in
Canada.

   Separately, GM said slow sales are forcing it to cut
production of its year-old plastic-bodied APV minivans. The
move will mean 450 workers will be laid off indefinitely from
the recently refurbished APV factory in North Tarrytown, N.Y.
after a three-week long shutdown that begins July 30.
   The plant Chrysler is closing, in Brampton, Ontario,
builds the Jeep Wrangler off-road vehicle. Chrysler's
decision came after state and local governments in Ohio
promised tax breaks and other subsidies valued at about $14.5
million to keep Chrysler's aging Toledo Jeep plant open.
Thus, the Brampton plant became expendable.
   Earlier this year, Chrysler negotiated a new contract with
the United Auto Workers union local in Toledo. The pact
promises to give the auto maker more flexibility in running
the plant in return for a commitment to keep the factory open
until 1997.
   Chrysler said it will move Wrangler production to Toledo
beginning in the summer of 1992. In addition, Chrysler said
it is going ahead with plans to develop a new, small Jeep,
code-named JJ, and may build that vehicle in Toledo, too.
   The JJ's fate has been unclear since June, when Chrysler
canceled a deal to develop the vehicle in a joint venture
with Renault. By laying out its Jeep production strategy now,
Chrysler may be clearing the way for another company,
possibly Fiat S.p.A of Italy, to take Renault's place as a
partner in the project.
   Chrysler officials refused to comment yesterday on
speculation that Fiat and Chrysler are preparing to broaden
their ties with the JJ deal as a starting point.
   However, Chrysler's announcement indicated it is preparing
to sever more of its ties to Renault. Chrysler said that
beginning in mid-1992, it plans to build a new line of
midsized and large cars, code-named LH/LX, in the Bramalea,
Ontario, plant that currently builds the Renault-engineered
Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco. No new manufacturing site was
announced for the Premier and Monaco, indicating that those
models will be discontinued.
   Under agreements with Renault, Chrysler likely will pay
the French auto maker as much as $200 million in penalties
related to the slow sales of the cars, a Chrysler spokesman
said.
   Meanwhile, GM's decision to cut production of its new
minivans is an embarrassing setback for a product the company
touted as the forerunner of a broad product renaissance.
   But GM's effort to leapfrog Chrysler's popular minivans
with a radical design apparently didn't impress consumers,
who found the vehicles expensive, and lacking in cargo room
and engine power.
   Dealers said they weren't surprised by news of the
layoffs. "Sales have been OK but nothing great," said Glen
Cain, general sales manager of Desmond Pontiac in Cincinnati.
Even with a $1,500 rebate, the dealership has been selling
only two or three Pontiac Trans Sport minivans a month.
   So far this model year, GM has sold only 74,337 of the APV
vans, just over half of the 141,263 vehicles produced since
the start of production last summer.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chrysler's shares closed at $15.875, unchanged,
while GM's closed at $47.625, down 25 cents.
