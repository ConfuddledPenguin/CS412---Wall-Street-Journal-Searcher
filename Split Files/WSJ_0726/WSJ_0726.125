   TOKYO -- Sumitomo Bank Ltd. said it plans to set up a bank
holding company in the U.S. that will house its American
non-commercial banking activities, specifically the bank's
trust-banking and capital-markets operations.
   The Japanese bank also said it planned to invest about
$320 million in establishing new units involved in leasing,
investment management and securities.

   In addition, Sumitomo said that each of the three new
units will have a chief operating officer from the U.S. and
that "the bank will minimize the number of Japanese personnel
who will be engaged in the companies' management."
   One of the advantages of a holding company's structure is
that it allows foreign financial institutions to create
separate legal entities, which can offer Americans such
positions as chairman and president.
   Sumitomo said it has applied to Japan's Ministry of
Finance and to the Federal Reserve for approval of its plans.
