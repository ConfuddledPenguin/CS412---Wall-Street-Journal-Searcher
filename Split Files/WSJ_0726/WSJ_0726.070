   WASHINGTON -- The nation's thrifts posted losses of $271
million in the first quarter of 1990, savings and loan
regulators said, in their best quarter since they reported a
small profit a year earlier.
   But some analysts say the results are misleading. They
don't include losses at 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls under government
management waiting to be sold; these results will be reported
later. And the figures do include $1.9 billion of government
assistance pumped into 202 thrifts, resulting from lucrative
deals struck in 1988 and before, officials said.

   About $1.5 billion in the assistance went to the buyers,
including the Robert Bass Group and New York financier Ronald
Perelman, as payment for managing the bad investments that
came with the sick S&amp;Ls. Another $400 million was paid in
interest on nontaxable notes that went to the buyers to make
up for the losses that the S&amp;Ls dragged with them into the
deal, said Mary Creeden, an official of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   Those transactions, which also provided billions of
dollars in tax breaks for holding companies of the S&amp;Ls, are
being examined by the regulators looking for ways to slash
the costs of the deals to the taxpayer. For example, the
high-interest notes might be paid off with cash. The studies
are expected to be completed soon.
   Some industry analysts say the government assistance
distorts the health of the S&amp;Ls, and that those sold in 1988
wouldn't be profitable without the assistance. "The
incentives they created were all wrong," asserts Roger
Kormendi, professor of finance at the University of Michigan,
who studied the transactions for the government a year ago.
"They have guarantees regardless of performance."
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said he was mildly encouraged that losses have
ebbed for the three-quarters of the industry that isn't
queued up to be sold. "Should we jump up and down and declare
victory?" he mused. "No. This is still a very, very tough
situation in my view."
   In the 1989 first quarter, the private-sector thrifts
earned $10 million. The number of thrifts fell to 2,505 in
the 1990 first quarter from 2,761 a year earlier.
   Mr. Ryan attributed the earnings improvement to the
seizure of 84 sick S&amp;Ls in the first quarter, which
effectively removed them as competitors for deposits.
   With S&amp;Ls being shuffled among government agencies
according to their health, the thrift regulators appeared as
confused as the taxpayers as to who will pay $130 billion --
or $500 billion with interest -- over the next 40 years for
the S&amp;L cleanup. The first-quarter results were delayed by
weeks, and the thrift office now reports deposit inflows and
outflows quarterly instead of monthly, despite protests from
analysts who rely on the data.
   Also, this was the first time the results didn't include
the insolvent S&amp;Ls seized by the Resolution Trust Corp. for
later sale. Their losses, which would have dragged the other
part of the industry even further into the red, will be
reported separately in a few weeks.
   Mr. Ryan, who has held his post for four months now,
acknowledged that the office was disorganized, but attributed
it to a new data-collection system and said the agency wasn't
trying to stem bad news. In the past, thrift regulators have
vastly underestimated the size of the S&amp;L losses, which
delayed the cleanup. "I am not going to be Mr. Rosy
Scenario," he said.
