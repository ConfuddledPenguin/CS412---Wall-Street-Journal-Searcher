   Investors breathed some life back into over-the-counter
stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.89 to 445.45, a 0.65%
gain, ending a six-session losing streak and outpacing a 0.3%
rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Advancing shares
overtook decliners, 1,097 to 782.

   However, the number of shares hitting new lows continued
to outnumber those reaching new highs, 99 to 45. Volume fell
to 141.6 million shares from 160.5 million Tuesday.
   The hard-hit technology sector bounced back, fueling a
0.9% advance in the Nasdaq Industrial Index. Shares of
Microsoft rebounded 2 to 71 1/2 shortly before the software
leader reported net income for the fourth quarter ended June
30 rose to 65 cents a share from 40 cents a year earlier.
   "It's still an earnings-driven market," said Jim O'Neill,
co-manager of OTC trading for Robinson-Humphrey Co. While Mr.
O'Neill said the selling pressure on smaller stocks abated
somewhat, he added that investors "aren't stepping over each
other to buy them." William A. Rothe, managing director of
OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, agreed that investors were
selective yesterday.
   Earnings reported late Tuesday by Seagate Technology
generally dispelled fears about weakness in the disk-drive
sector, which had been "running rampant" in advance of the
report, according to Montgomery Securities analyst Paul G.
Fox.
   Yesterday, Mr. Fox and his colleague, Steven L. Ossad,
switched a "hold" opinion issued Tuesday on Maxtor, a Seagate
competitor, to a "buy" opinion, after the stock's 26% plunge
Tuesday on what they called overreaction to fears about the
sector.
   Mr. Fox said in an interview that disk-drive inventory
levels appear very healthy and said he believes concerns in
advance of Seagate's report were excessive. Trading at a
multiple of 6.9 times 1990 earnings after its 26% drop
Tuesday, Maxtor is the cheapest among the disk-drive stocks,
he noted. Seagate gained 1/8 to 12 1/2; Maxtor eased 1/2 to
10 1/4.
   Among other technology issues, AST Research climbed 2 1/4
to 22 5/8 after the Irvine, Calif., maker of
personal-computer systems reported that net income for the
fourth quarter ended June 30 jumped to $1.18 a share from 21
cents a year earlier.
   Sun Microsystems added 1 5/8 to 33 1/2 after the maker of
computer workstations said it authorized MicroAge of Tempe,
Ariz., to distribute its Sparc-based workstations. MicroAge
rose 1 3/4 to 16 1/4.
   Cellular Communications was the day's most-active stock,
falling 2 1/4 to 33 on nearly 2.8 million shares. The New
York company agreed to combine cellular operations in Ohio
and Michigan with Pacific Telesis Group. Pacific Telesis also
will buy 5% of Cellular Communications' stock and has the
option of buying the remainder of the company over the next 5
1/2 years. Cellular Communications also announced other
transactions, which include spinning off its international
and long-distance microwave interests to the public.
   Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer soared 4 to 29 1/4 after word
reached investors that the Salt Lake City maker of
three-dimensional graphics systems will be a subcontractor to
Loral Corp. on a $71.5 million Air Force contract, Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said. A company spokeswoman said
details of the award aren't available yet.
   Earnings reports continued to bruise stocks.
   Advo-System slipped 5/8 to 10 7/8 on nearly 1.2 million
shares. The Windsor, Conn., provider of direct-mail
advertising services reported late Tuesday that net income
for the third quarter ended June 30 rose slightly to 34 cents
a share from 32 cents a year earlier.
   Datron Systems tumbled 1 to 6 3/4 after the Simi Valley,
Calif., maker of satellite-communication and radar systems
reported net income for the first quarter ended June 30
dropped to six cents a share from 28 cents a year earlier.
   Alliant Computer eased 3/8 to 4 3/8. The Littleton, Mass.,
maker of computer systems said that it expects to report a
loss for the third quarter ending in September "similar" to a
loss of nine cents a share reported yesterday for the second
quarter ended June 30. Alliant attributed the weak outlook to
seasonally sluggish business in European business and
difficulties related to a new product. The company earned
three cents a share in the year-earlier second quarter.
   Chips &amp; Technologies lost 1 1/4 to 16 1/4, although
earnings reported late Tuesday by the San Jose, Calif.,
company fell within analysts' expectations. The stock dropped
on nearly four times average volume after Sutro &amp; Co.
electronics and computing analyst John Nguyen repeated a
long-standing "sell" recommendation, according to DJPIR. Mr.
Nguyen said he continues to believe the company's gross
profit margins will be pressured by a softening personal
computer market and intensifying competition in the
personal-computer chipset business.
   North Side Savings Bank fell 1/2 to 8 after the bank
reported a loss for the third quarter ended June 30 of $2.42
a share, widened from a loss of 75 cents a year earlier. The
most recent quarter included a $1.76-million loan-loss
provision, which North Side said it took to "aggressively
confront the current real estate environment."
   Calgon Carbon fell 1/2 to 45 3/4, although the Pittsburgh
maker of activated carbons reported net income for the second
quarter ended June 30 rose to 54 cents a share from 47 cents
a year earlier. The figure matched a consensus of analysts'
estimates reported by First Call, a subsidiary of Thomson
Financial Networks.
   Bizmart skidded 1 3/4 to 14 3/8 after Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
analyst Chris E. Vroom lowered his earnings estimate for the
Arlington, Texas, retailer of office products, according to
DJPIR and a employee of the brokerage firm. Alex. Brown was
the lead underwriter for a 2.75-million share offering of
Bizmart's shares on July 18 priced at $15.75 apiece; delivery
of the stock was scheduled for yesterday. Mr. Vroom was not
immediately available for comment.
