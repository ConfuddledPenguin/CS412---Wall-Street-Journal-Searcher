   NEW YORK -- The dollar's new found strength is expected to
last until turmoil in the Middle East stops shielding it from
worries about the weak U.S. economy.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is yet another political
development that has helped the dollar defy predictions for a
steep decline, forecasts that have been prevalent for the
past two years.

   For much of 1989, the dollar was surprisingly strong
because of political setbacks in such nations as China, Japan
and Britain. As the world's most liquid currency, the dollar
is one of the "safe havens" that investors flock to when
major nations have severe political troubles.
   Because of this safe-haven status, the dollar didn't
plunge Friday even though talk about a U.S. recession flowed
freely on Wall Street after the release of very worrisome
July employment data.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
150.08 yen, up from 149.35 yen at the close Friday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at 1.5885 marks.
   After days of heavy sales, the dollar traded as low as
1.5818 marks early Thursday and came close to testing its
post-World War II low of 1.5615 marks. But it made a quick
turnaround after tensions in the Middle East flared up.
   Once Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait, traders were no
longer shy about buying dollars, as they had been previously
because of the feeble U.S. economy and falling interest rates
that lessen the attractiveness of dollar-denominated
investments.
   Now many traders say forecasts for a new record low
against the mark are on hold. The dollar won't fall very far
"as long as the tension is in the air," says Thomas Benfer, a
foreign exchange marketing representative at the Bank of
Montreal.
   Mr. Benfer says "the whole gamut" of market participants
races to buy dollars whenever tensions rise in the Middle
East, including corporations and speculators.
   Friday's dealings were particularly rough going because of
nonstop headlines from every corner of the world, traders
say. They were glued to news screens all day, watching for
developments in the Mideast.
   For much of the session, the dollar was supported by fears
that tensions would escalate. Late in the day, however, the
U.S. currency slipped on reports that an Iraqi government
spokesman said Iraqi forces will begin withdrawing from
Kuwait on Sunday.
   But even so, it may take a while for the highly charged
atmosphere in the Persian Gulf to calm enough for the dollar
to resume its decline.
   The Middle East showdown overshadowed the weak July U.S.
employment data, which otherwise would likely have sparked a
plummet.
   The civilian jobless rate rose to 5.5% from 5.2% in June,
climbing to the highest level since August 1988. Expectations
had been for a 5.3% unemployment rate. Closely monitored
non-farm payrolls dropped 219,000 to 110.71 million, the
largest decline since striking American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. workers cut the number of jobs by 339,000 in August 1983.
   Those weak statistics follow news about the economy's 1.2%
annual rate of growth in the second quarter, merely a
fraction of the pace needed to help the U.S. keep up with
West Germany and Japan.
   The jobs data sent the stock market tumbling, as investors
worried that the economy may slip into recession. The economy
is "soft, soft, soft," says Roger Shields, chief
international economist at Chemical Bank. The weakness, he
adds, is "more pervasive" than it appeared to be only a few
months ago.
   Mr. Shields and other economists say the outlook is
particularly grim, as the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to
remedy the economy with an easier monetary policy because of
the inflationary implications of soaring oil prices.
   The Fed is generally expected to allow the important
federal funds rate to fall soon by a modest 1/4 percentage
point from the current average of 8%. Fed funds, the charge
on reserves traded among commercial banks overnight, was last
lowered July 13 when the Fed loosened credit because of
strains in the banking system.
   "The Fed is probably going to have to sit down and review
these developments very carefully. It's harder to read the
tea leaves than it's ever been," says Mr. Shields. Even if
U.S. exports perk up this quarter, the economy will probably
have little more than "slight growth," he says.
   But there are even gloomier forecasts.
   "The odds of a zero {growth} quarter are very high," says
Ram Bhagavatula, chief money market economist at Citibank.
Although the economy's growth is faint, there haven't yet
been two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the usual
sign of a recession.
   With the economy ailing and the Fed in an easing mode when
most other global central banks are maintaining tight
policies, dollar selling is seen resuming once the tensions
in the Middle East abate.
   Says Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.: "All in all, conditions argue for the fact
that the dollar is in trouble."
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$379 an ounce.
