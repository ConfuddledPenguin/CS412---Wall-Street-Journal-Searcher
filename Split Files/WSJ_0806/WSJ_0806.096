   A group including Laurence A. Tisch, chief executive
officer of CBS Inc. and chairman of Loews Corp., both New
York, said it raised its stake in Bank of Boston Corp. common
stock to 8.9%.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Tisch
group said it holds 6,490,020 Bank of Boston shares,
including 1,004,420 bought Wednesday and Thursday for $9.875
to $10 each. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Friday, Bank of Boston shares closed at $10.75, up 62.5

   The filing didn't give a reason for the recent purchases.
In December, the group disclosed it held 4,729,400 Bank of
Boston shares, or a 6.6% stake; it said then that it bought
the stock for investment purposes and that it hadn't any
intention of seeking control of the company.
   A spokesman said Bank of Boston talked with the Tisch
group and believes its increased stake "is for investment
purposes and reflects long-term confidence in the corporation
and management, and in the fundamentals of our stock."
