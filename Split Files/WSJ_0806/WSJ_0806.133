   AMERICAN TELEPHONE &amp; TELEGRAPH Co. has named James R.
Walker, customer-service vice president of its small-business
equipment unit, to the position of vice president-national
sales and service, succeeding current national-sales chief
Erik Jorgensen, who is retiring. The move is part of a
consolidation in which AT&amp;T has combined sales and service
into 29 centers around the country, made each office into a
profit-and-loss center and named four regional vice
presidents to supervise them.
