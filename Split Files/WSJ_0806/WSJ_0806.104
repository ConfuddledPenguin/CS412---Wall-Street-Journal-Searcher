   Bongrain S.A. said its consolidated revenue rose 7% in the
first half of 1990 to 4.36 billion French francs ($821
million) from 4.09 billion francs in the year-earlier period.
   The French food group said in a communique that after
adjustments for changes in group structure and exchange
rates, the sales gain would have been limited to 1.7%.

   It didn't elaborate on the structural changes, but
significant acquisitions made by Bongrain since the first
half of 1989 include the Italian cheese group Ludovico S.p.a.

Inc. in February 1989.
   For all of 1989, it reported consolidated net profit of
391 million francs after payments to minority interests, on
revenue of 8.48 billion francs.
