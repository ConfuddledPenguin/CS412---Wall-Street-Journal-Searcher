   BATON ROUGE, La. -- Great American Corp. said banking
regulators closed its last remaining operating unit, American
Bank &amp; Trust Co., and sold most of the assets and all the
deposits to a unit of Hancock Holding Co., a Gulfport, Miss.,
bank holding concern.
   Great American said its assets now consist of a lawsuit
against Union Planters Corp., Memphis, Tenn., which it
accuses of breaching a contract to merge with Great American,
and about $100,000 of cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities
total about $3.5 million, the company added. A spokesman said
Great American doesn't plan to file for federal
bankruptcy-court protection.
