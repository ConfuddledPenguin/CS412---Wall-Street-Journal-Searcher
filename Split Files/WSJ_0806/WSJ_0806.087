   The notes will be priced at a spread to the bond
equivalent yield of the 91-day U.S. Treasury bill.
   The interest rates on the notes will be reset on the day
following each weekly Treasury bill auction.
   The notes will be offered in the U.S. domestic market and
the Eurodollar market through selling groups managed by
Sallie Mae.
   The notes will be issued in book-entry form only in
denominations of $1,000 and in $1,000 increments.
