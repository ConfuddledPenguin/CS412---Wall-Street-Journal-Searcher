   Nevada Power Co. said second-quarter profit fell 49.6%
because of cooler than normal weather, the effects of a rate
decrease and higher costs of service for a growing customer
base.
   For the quarter, Las Vegas-based Nevada Power posted net
income of $6.5 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with
year-ago profit of $13 million, or 46 cents a share. There
were 28.6 million shares outstanding in the recent quarter
compared with 26.7 million in the year-ago period.
Second-quarter revenues climbed 10% to $112.1 million from
$101.8 million.

   For the 12 months ended June 30, the utility reported net
income of $45 million, or $1.54 a share, down 14% from the
previous year's profit of $52.3 million, or $1.85 a share.
Revenues rose 6.3% to $441.6 million from $415.2 million a
year earlier. There were 27.3 million shares outstanding in
the recent 12 months compared with 26.7 million a year ago.
   Nevada Power said that lower rates went into effect April
1. Expenditures to maintain generating units and support to
service the company's rapidly growing customer base, which
increased at an annual rate of 9.7%, also hurt earnings.
