   LONDON -- Coats Viyella PLC, a U.K. textile maker, said it
satisfied regulatory conditions for a bid for Tootal Group
PLC, another U.K. textile group.
   Coats Viyella said it sold its U.K. thread business to
Amann &amp; Soehne G.m.b.H., a West German textile group, for an
undisclosed sum.

   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said in October that
Coats could only take over Tootal if it disposed of all of
its U.K. interests in domestic sewing thread supply and its
shares in Gutermann Group.
   In December, the friendly #395 million ($732.6 million)
bid foundered following the breakdown of talks between the
two companies. Tootal said at the time that the offer failed
to reflect the company's strengths and prospects.
   Russell Walls, finance director of Coats Viyella, said the
company was now "free from any restrictions" to bid for
Tootal. He added that no negotiations were taking place
between the two companies.
   Coats Viyella sold its stake in the Gutermann Group to the
Gutermann family in May for an undisclosed sum.
