   Sun Microsystems Inc., reflecting continuing cash needs
and a previously reported arrangement, said it planned to
sell stock valued at $191.8 million to American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   Under a 1988 agreement, Sun has the right to sell to AT&amp;T
newly issued shares in an amount of up to 15% of Sun's common
stock outstanding. The latest sale, covering 4,575,469 Sun
shares, means that Sun has sold AT&amp;T a total of 14.7% of its
shares. Under the 1988 agreement, AT&amp;T can buy an additional
5% stake through open market purchases. The latest sale
covers an amount equal to nearly 5% of Sun's 92.7 million
common shares outstanding.
