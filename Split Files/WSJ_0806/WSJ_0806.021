   WASHINGTON -- Cambridge Capital Fund L.P. said it
increased its stake in Whitehall Corp. to 12.2% even though
it had disclosed in an earlier filing that it could not
structure an acquisition of the Dallas-based defense
contractor that was economically justifiable and still
acceptable to Whitehall shareholders.
   In April, Cambridge proposed a tender offer at $20 a
share, but withdrew it when it lost a proxy contest later
that month. Cambridge said then it would explore
alternatives. Cambridge bought 43,600 shares Wednesday and
Thursday at $11.75 to $12 a share.
