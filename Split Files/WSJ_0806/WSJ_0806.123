   EAST GERMAN ARMS

   East Germany's military has canceled arms contracts with
all 2,000 domestic suppliers, the government said.
   The announcement appeared to be another effort to rebut
West German accusations that East Germany was wasting money
on weapons and military expenses even though its army faced
dissolution after unity at the end of this year.
   Lt. Gen. Ehrenfried Ullmann, procurement chief for the
Disarmament and Defense Ministry, said the army voided 10,000
contracts with its 2,000 domestic suppliers, effective Aug.
1. About 100,000 jobs could be lost because of the canceled
contracts.
   The National People's Army has shriveled from 173,000
crack troops before East Germany's popular revolution against
Stalinist rule in 1989 to 98,000 today. Bonn says only a
minority can be absorbed in a future all-German military.
                                                                                                       

   COCAINE SHIPMENTS TO EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   Cocaine shipments to Europe are likely to double this
year, a U.S. official said. The official, a narcotics expert
who requested anonymity, told reporters in Bogota that he
believed cocaine shipments to Europe from Latin America would
reach 200 metric tons this year, up from 100 metric tons in
1989. He said traffickers were turning more to Europe because
profits were much higher than in the U.S. One kilogram (2.2
pounds) of cocaine could be worth between $35,000 and $55,000
on the streets of Europe compared with around $20,000 in
Miami.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR RATIONING IN BUCHAREST

   Sugar rationing resumes in Bucharest this week, with each
citizen of the Romanian capital being permitted to buy 1.5
kilograms (3.3 pounds) a month. Sugar had been rationed under
the Ceausescu regime. The government that took power after
December's revolution lifted rations; but once sugar sent as
aid from abroad ran out, the commodity became increasingly
scarce and in the past several weeks has been mostly
unavailable.
                                                                                                       

   BANK OF TOKYO IN TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Despite earlier protests from China, Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
has opened a representative office in Taipei, a step other
Japanese banks are likely to follow.
   Bank of Tokyo announced its intention to open the Taipei
office in May. However, a barrage of criticism from China
persuaded it to delay the opening. Analysts said the bank
finally was able to open the Taipei office on Friday because
China's need for foreign aid -- which it will be getting from
Japan -- has given it little room to complain about Japanese
banks entering Taiwan.
                                                                                                       

   A COMPLAINT IN BRITAIN
                                                                                                       

   American Airlines has filed a complaint with the U.S.
Department of Transportation against BAA PLC, a British
airports operator, because the airline is barred from
handling its own passenger check-in and ticketing at London's
Gatwick Airport. BAA owns and operates eight British
airports, including Gatwick. At Gatwick, four companies are
licensed by BAA to offer handling, including British Airways.
American, a unit of AMR Corp., says that by having to
contract out for these services, it suffers a competitive
disadvantage and can't control the quality of the personnel.
                                                                                                       

   DWINDLING COMMUNIST PARTY
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Communist Party has lost 765,000 members so far
this year, leaving it with about 18 million members, the
party's personnel chief, Boris Pugo, said. He said 370,000
members quit the party, about three times the number of
membership cards turned in during all of 1989. In addition,
125,000 members were expelled, 120,000 died and 150,000
stopped paying their membership dues or participating in
party activities, Mr. Pugo said, adding that 125,000 new
members signed up in the first six months of this year.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S DECLINING BIRTHRATE
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu warned that the
nation's declining birthrate would lead to inflation and
shortages of workers, a Japanese news agency reported, adding
that Mr. Kaifu pledged to put countermeasures in place within
a decade.
   The government is concerned that a shortage of young
people and a growing number of old people will overburden the
nation's welfare system. The average Japanese woman had 1.57
children as of 1989, down from the previous low of 1.58 in
1966. And on Saturday the government reported that Japan set
a world record for longevity last year, with the average life
expectancy reaching 81.77 years for women and 75.91 years for
men.
   The prime minister reportedly said that policies
restricting foreign workers should be examined.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The East Berlin building that once housed East Germany's
Communist State Security Ministry -- the infamous "Stasi" --
is to become a meeting place and research center dedicated to
the defunct ministry's victims. The Anti-Stalinist Action
Foundation said the building would house exhibitions and a
library. . . . The Vatican said callers to new Holy See
telephone numbers would, for a fee, hear excerpts from recent
speeches by Pope John Paul II in English, Spanish or Italian.
U.S. numbers are 1-900230-POPE for English, 1-900-230-PAPA
for Spanish and 1-900-230-7273 for Italian. U.S. calls will
cost $5 each.
