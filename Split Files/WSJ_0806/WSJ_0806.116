   DETROIT -- A surge in late-July sales by General Motors
Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. pushed up
domestic car and truck sales for the month by 1% over a year
ago.
   For the final 10 days of July, sales of North
American-made cars rose 9.5% to 395,803 vehicles. That
translated to a seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of
7.7 million cars, up from a 7.4 million pace a year ago and
6.9 million rate in the middle 10 days of the month.

   However, the late-July gains didn't dispel uncertainty
about the auto industry's near-term future in the face of
rising oil prices and a weakening U.S. economy. On Friday,
the government said the nation's jobless rate rose to 5.5% in
July, a hefty jump of 0.3 percentage points. And gas prices
shot up as much as 15 cents a gallon at service stations in
the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   "The whole business world is very concerned," said analyst
Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "And the auto world has
to be a little more concerned than other sectors."
   Indeed, Ford Motor Co., fighting a slump in sales of its
cars, said it will idle the Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant
that builds Mustangs for one week beginning Aug. 13.
   But one car dealer said he's yet to see evidence that the
Persian Gulf crisis has shoppers worried. "All I know is we
had a showroom full of customers {Thursday night} and we sold
28 new vehicles," said Bill Curry, general sales manager of
Art Moran Pontiac GMC in Southfield, Mich. "I didn't have one
customer talk about the situation in Kuwait."
   GM outpaced the overall market in July, posting a 2.3%
increase in overall car and truck sales. In the last 10 days
of the month, GM's total car and truck sales jumped 15.1%.
Sales of GM cars rose 14% in the late July period. GM's share
of the car market rose to 36.2% in the month from a weak
34.8% a year ago.
   Dealers said much of GM's gain was at the lower-price end
of the market.
   "General Motors dealers are learning how to equip cars
better on the low end," said John Bergstrom, who owns five GM
dealerships in Wisconsin. "We just had them too expensive for
a long time. We're learning if we don't put too much
equipment on them and we keep the price down we can compete
against the Japanese."
   Meanwhile, Japanese auto makers continued to boost their
share of the car market, improving on a record performance
during the first half of the year. Japanese nameplate cars
captured 29% of the car market in July, up from 26% in July
of 1989. Toyota's overall vehicle sales surged 21.1% while
Honda posted an 11.3% gain. However, Nissan Motor Co. had a
4.9% drop in overall sales during the latest month and some
of the smaller Japanese companies also had poor results.
   Ford, however, saw its share of the car market fall to
20.4% for the month, down from 23% a year ago. Chrysler's car
market share dropped to 8.1% in July from 9.4% a year ago.
Both Honda and Toyota sold more passenger cars than Chrysler
in July.
   Ford suffered an 8% drop in total car and truck sales for
July. In the final 10 days of the month, sales of Ford cars
tumbled 14.1%, more than offsetting an 11.7% rise in truck
sales. The No. 2 car maker is being dragged down by the
sluggish performance of its new Escort economy car. Ford sold
20,826 Escorts in July, a 35% drop from year-ago sales.
   "We used to sell 125 Escorts a month and now we're selling
25 Escorts," says John Noble, general manager of Town &amp;
Country Ford in Charlotte, N.C. The problem, he says, is that
many potential Escort buyers are having trouble getting loans
for the higher priced 1991 models.
   Chrysler Corp., which has been struggling since February,
saw its total vehicle sales drop 15.1% in July. Chrysler's
car and truck sales fell 9.5% in late July.

   MAZDA MOTOR Corp. sold 120,030 imported cars in the Jan. 1
to July 30 period. For the period, Mazda's total car sales
were 163,170 vehicles and its combined car and truck sales
were 214,079 vehicles. These statistics were misstated in the
car sales table in yesterday's edition because of incorrect
information provided by Mazda. A corrected market share table
appears {in this issue}.
