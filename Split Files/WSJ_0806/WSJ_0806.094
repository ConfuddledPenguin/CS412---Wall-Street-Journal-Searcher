   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of newsprint in June
dropped 3.4% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
95% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 762,000 metric tons of
newsprint in June, compared with 789,000 a year earlier. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   June shipments fell less than 1% to 804,000 metric tons
