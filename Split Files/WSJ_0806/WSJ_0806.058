   Japan and the European Community nations, which in
previous years hesitated to support U.S. initiatives in the
Middle East, made strong commitments to Washington's call for
economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
   Japan, which took a heavy economic gamble to do so, said
late Sunday it would ban all oil imports from Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, halt all exports to the two states and
freeze economic aid to Baghdad. Not only does Japan import
12% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait, but it also has 700
billion yen ($4.67 billion) in loans outstanding to Baghdad,
which are now at risk.

   And in what is being called the strongest punitive action
ever taken by the European Community, the 12-nation bloc
agreed Saturday to impose a series of tough sanctions aimed
at "the heart" of Iraqi economic and military interests. The
sanctions include an oil embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, a halt
on military sales to Iraq and suspension of cooperation with
Iraq in military, technical and scientific fields.
   The strength of the EC measures and the unanimity were in
marked contrast to past crises, when the EC members have been
divided over whether to impose sanctions and how strong they
should be. During the U.S.-hostage taking in Iran, for
example, trade sanctions imposed by the EC fell short of U.S.
expectations. There have also been differences among the
member nations on policy toward Libya.
   The EC imports 10.9% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait, and
an oil embargo could hurt some EC members such as Denmark,
which depends on Iraq and Kuwait for more than half of its
oil.
   The EC members said they were also prepared to support and
enforce United Nations sanctions against Iraq if Baghdad
failed to heed calls for the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of its troops from Kuwait. (Members of the U.N.
Security Council met informally yesterday, and the U.S. urged
the imposition of broad economic and military sanctions on
Iraq. Diplomats expect the measures to be adopted, perhaps as
early as today.)
   "We will not be satisfied until there is not a single
Iraqi soldier in Kuwait and until there is a legitimate and
sovereign government in Kuwait," Italian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Giovanni Castellaneta said.
   In a speech yesterday in Aspen, Colo., British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Iraqi invasion and
called for a "total economic embargo" against Iraq unless it
withdraws from Kuwait "without delay." She added: "The U.S.
and Europe both support this. But to be totally effective it
will need the support of all U.N. members. They must stand up
and be counted because a vital principle is at stake: An
aggressor must never be allowed to get his way." Mrs.
Thatcher is expected to meet with President Bush in
Washington today.
   In opting to impose an oil embargo, Japan departed from
its usual oil-first policy. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
overrode the opposition of the powerful Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, which feared a long-term
impact on Japan's economy. In 1979, Tokyo refused to follow
suit when the U.S. and Western Europe imposed an oil embargo
on Iran after Tehran took Americans hostage at the U.S.
Embassy.
   "It is the very first time for Japan to take such a
drastic move before the U.N. has decided anything on
sanctions," a Foreign Ministry official who requested
anonymity told Japan's Kyodo news service.
   This time, the decision was clearly in favor of
international solidarity. "Japan will face hardships due to
the ban on oil imports, but this is a bold start in
international cooperation," said Deputy Chief Cabinet
Secretary Nobuo Ishihara. Although Japan imports 99% of its
oil, it has almost five months' supply in reserve against any
oil cutoff.
   The new Iraqi-installed government in Kuwait, meanwhile,
has warned countries with nationals in Kuwait not to take
sanctions against it or Iraq. Well over one million
foreigners work in Kuwait, among them thousands of Westerners
and Japanese with senior positions in banks and the oil
industry, and a substantial group of Western military
advisers.
   "These countries should also not expect us to act
honorably at a time when they are conspiring against us and
other brothers in Iraq in an aggressive way," Iraqi-imposed
Foreign Minister Walid Saud Muammad Abdullah said on Iraqi
radio.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and French President
Francois Mitterrand, meanwhile, discussed the invasion by
telephone Saturday, Soviet news media reported. They
exchanged views, assessed the situation as serious and agreed
to continue contacts, according to the Tass news agency and
Radio Moscow.
   Mr. Mitterrand discussed a punitive blockade of Iraq with
key cabinet members on Saturday, Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas said. Mr. Dumas said a blockade and military action
were considered in response to the invasion. A blockade "was
examined with all the country's service heads, notably the
military," Mr. Dumas said in answer to a reporter's question.
He didn't specify if this referred to a naval blockade, and
said a blockade was a measure that had to be taken in concert
with all major powers.
   In an apparent rebuff to Iraqi efforts to stop at least
part of the embargo, Turkish President Turgut Ozal yesterday
declined to guarantee that Iraq's vital trans-Turkey pipeline
will be safe from international economic sanctions, according
to a Turkish individual close to the talks. Iraq sent a top
official to Ankara yesterday to confer with Mr. Ozal, but
"President Ozal was noncommittal about the pipeline," the
individual said.
   More than half of Iraq's oil exports are pumped through
the pipeline from the Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean
coast. On leaving Ankara, the Iraqi official appealed to
Turkey to "take their joint interests into account" and not
to create an "atmosphere of distrust" by cutting the vital
artery. Iraq earns almost all of its foreign exchange from
oil.
   Foreign diplomats think it unlikely that Turkey will close
the pipeline but note a hardening of the Turkish position on
the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, despite its important ties with
Baghdad. In public statements, Turkey has called only for the
implementation of the U.N. resolution calling for Iraq's
withdrawal. But Mr. Ozal's spokesman said the Turkish
president had demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from
Kuwait and the restoration of the deposed Emir of Kuwait.
   President Bush has called Mr. Ozal twice so far to discuss
the crisis and Mr. Ozal has been conducting intense telephone
diplomacy in the region, but Turkish and U.S. officials say
there has been no direct U.S. pressure on Turkey to cut the
pipeline.
   Meanwhile, the prospect of higher oil prices is unraveling
the silver lining in Britain's bleak economy and further
clouding the already faltering United Kingdom stock market.
Inflation, which was expected to be capped at around 10.5%
this month, now is expected to keep rising. And any cut in
Britain's 15% base interest rate probably won't come until
early 1991 instead of occurring later this year, analysts and
economists predict.
   Until last week, many U.K. fund managers and other market
experts were predicting a lagging stock market through year
end, followed by a sharp recovery spurred by expected
interest rate cuts.
   But that timetable now may have to be revised. The market
impact of the gulf crisis is likely to be adverse, sharp and
broadly based, analysts say. With the obvious exception of
defense and oil stocks, shares of industrial and
consumer-oriented companies -- many of which were already
reeling before last week -- are expected to come under
greater pressure.
   The West Germans have special reason to worry about
another oil crisis. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has pledged not to
boost taxes to pay for his unification plan. This means that
Bonn is borrowing money on international credit markets and
would feel the direct impact of higher interest rates
prompted by a global economic downturn.
   But West German officials insist that the country is
well-positioned to deal with whatever comes out of the
current crisis. They point out that West Germany's strong
economy and large trade surplus give them at least a partial
buffer against events beyond their control.
   The 12 EC nations didn't cut diplomatic relations or
withdraw their ambassadors from Iraq because that would make
it impractical to defend their citizens in the area. In a
written statement, the EC countries described as "groundless
and unacceptable" Iraq's justification for the military
action. They said they would do everything they could to
avoid an implicit recognition of the so-called provisional
government installed in Kuwait.
   The Soviet Union, following the invasion, demanded that
Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait, and it cut off arms
supplies to Baghdad. Soviet officials and the state-run press
have unanimously condemned the action. Straight news reports
on the invasion have dominated newspapers, television and
radio. Saturday, several papers described Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein as a dictator and a liar and said the invasion
was a crime.
   Such coverage marks a radical reversal of decades of
silence during which Soviet officials and journalists
wouldn't criticize any close ally. The Soviet Union has been
Iraq's main source of weapons for 30 years and has a
friendship and cooperation treaty with Baghdad.
   Indeed, the attack has provoked unprecedented cooperation
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which issued a joint
appeal for a world ban on arms shipments to Iraq. That had
led to speculation that China, believed to be the
third-largest supplier of arms to Iraq after the Soviet Union
and France, would fill the breach as Paris and Moscow stemmed
the flow of their arms to Baghdad.
   But Sunday, China announced after two days of talks with a
special U.S. envoy that it wouldn't sell weapons to Iraq.
   Senior Chinese officials wouldn't, however, commit
themselves to supporting wider economic sanctions against
Baghdad.
