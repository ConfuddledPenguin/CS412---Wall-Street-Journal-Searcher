   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc., which promised its
bondholders 100 cents on the dollar, has found plenty of
investors eager to bail out at 94 cents or less during recent
market turmoil.
   Traders estimated that RJR in the past three weeks has
bought back nearly $1.5 billion of its 17% bonds of 2007.
Much of that buying was done last Thursday, traders said,
when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spooked many participants in
the financial markets. People familiar with the open-market
repurchase program estimate that RJR bought most bonds at 90
cents to 94 cents on the dollar.

   For RJR, retiring those bonds is an important step toward
shoring up the financial position of the highly leveraged
tobacco and food company. The 17% bonds are among RJR's
highest-cost debt. As part of a vast refinancing package
announced last month, RJR is retiring $4.4 billion of its
high-yield junk bonds and replacing them with lower-cost bank
debt, new preferred stock and additional equity. Junk bonds
are speculative-grade issues with low ratings or no ratings
at all.
   The latest repurchases "are positive for the company,"
said Dirk van Doren, an analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp;
Maffei. "It's nice to see them spending some dough to put
their plan into effect. I'm surprised, though, that so many
people sold."
   Traders said RJR's bond buying was arranged by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., RJR's majority owner. For several
weeks, KKR told bondholders that it was willing to buy their
bonds back at a slight discount to market prices. During
mid-July and late July, most holders balked at that offer, as
the RJR bonds of 2007 climbed from depressed levels to as
high as 95 1/2 cents on the dollar.
   Then last week, sentiment abruptly shifted. First a New
Jersey court ruling on July 26 raised fresh concerns about
tobacco companies' product liability. Then further troubles
with the UAL Inc. attempted buy-out caused some takeover
stock speculators, who owned large amounts of the RJR bonds,
to look for ways to lighten up their portfolios. Then Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait early Thursday morning touched off a
general financial scare.
   "It's amazing how market psychology works," said one top
junk-bond trader. "It was all greed, greed, greed. Then a lot
of greed turned to fear."
   Thursday, as junk-bond prices weakened, word circulated
that KKR and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. together were carrying out
a massive one-day buy-back of the RJR bonds. One trader said
he heard rumors that sellers were so bountiful that RJR might
substantially complete its bond buying that day. With most
RJR bonds down about $10 for each $1,000 face amount, holders
figured that this was their best chance to sell.
   "People panicked," a former RJR holder said. "Between
Kuwait and the cigarette ruling, people couldn't stand the
pain."
   On Thursday alone, KKR and Goldman Sachs together bought
$800 million to $1 billion of the RJR bonds, according to
people familiar with the repurchase. At least some of those
purchases were below the bonds' New York Stock Exchange
closing price of 91 3/4 cents on the dollar, traders said.
KKR, Goldman and RJR all said they wouldn't comment about
their roles.
   If traders' estimates of RJR's purchase prices are right,
the company probably acquired the bonds at $150 million or
more below face value, adjusting for accrued interest on the
bonds.
   That's a nifty windfall for RJR. Last month, the company
reset the bonds' interest rates from their previous 14.07%,
as part of its obligation to make the bonds trade at full
face value on what legal documents called "a fully
distributed basis." RJR also had penciled in plans to pay as
much as full face value for any bonds it retired.
   As McCarthy Crisanti's Mr. van Doren observed: "It isn't
as if KKR and RJR didn't tell us what they were going to do"
with the bond repurchases. "What's interesting is that they
pulled it off so quickly. It's a smooth act."
   The next step in RJR's refinancing package will be a $2.4
billion exchange offer for its 17 3/8% bonds of 2009. RJR
will offer cash and new preferred shares to bondholders. That
exchange offer has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and is expected to begin in about six
weeks.
   RJR also is committed to buy sufficiently more of the 17%
bonds so that its purchases total $1.7 billion by next April.
In addition, RJR has promised to spend at least another $350
million to buy either the 17% or the 17 3/8% bonds in the
open market or via tender offers.
