   National black organizations are planning to protest
Miami's snubbing of Nelson Mandela by boycotting the city as
a convention site.
   Maurice Wallace, executive director of the Metro Miami
Action Plan, says he asked about 30 black groups to send
representatives to a meeting on Wednesday about the proposed
boycott. Mr. Wallace, who heads the coalition of local black
groups, says he supports the boycott proposal.

   In June, the Miami City Commission, which includes Miami
Mayor Xavier Suarez and the Metro-Dade Commission, refused to
honor Mr. Mandela after he made comments supporting Cuban
leader Fidel Castro. Those comments angered Miami's powerful
Cuban-American voters.
   In the wake of the city's chilly reception of Mr. Mandela,
H.T. Smith, a member of the Dade County Black Lawyers
Association, started a campaign to persuade fellow members of
the 1,500-lawyer National Bar Association to reconsider plans
to hold their convention in Miami in 1993. Mr. Smith says the
dearth of black hotel employees in the city as well as
Miami's treatment of Haitian immigrants are other reasons for
the proposed boycott.
   At its convention in Houston last week, the bar
association voted not to hold its 1993 meeting in Miami. A
spokesman estimated that NBA members spend about $1 million
at their conventions.
   "The action we take has to be economic," Mr. Smith says.
"That's the only thing people of power understand."
   The 50,000-member Omega Psi Phi fraternity has also told
the Greater Miami Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau that it will
not hold its conference in Miami next year because of the
Mandela incident.
   A spokesman for the 5,000-member Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity, convening in Miami this week, said the
organization did not have time to change its plans. But, he
said that as another form of protest, the fraternity plans to
limit its spending to black merchants.
   The 10,000-member Delta Sigma Theta sorority convened in
Miami in July. The sorority -- which counts Mandela's wife,
Winnie, as an honorary member -- asked for an apology from
the county and municipal governments, but did not receive it.
   William Talbert, vice president of operations for the
Greater Miami Tourism &amp; Convention Bureau, a private
marketing organization, says the Miami-area tourism industry
could lose millions of dollars if black fraternities,
sororities and political, professional and trade
organizations reject Miami as a convention site.
   "We're still aggressively seeking to attract black
conventions and meetings in the greater Miami area," Mr.
Talbert says. Regarding the "perceived snub," of Mr. Mandela,
Mr. Talbert says, "We had no control of that."
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Suarez says the mayor does not
intend to lobby to keep black conventioneers. "He doesn't
plan to issue a public apology," the spokeswoman said.
