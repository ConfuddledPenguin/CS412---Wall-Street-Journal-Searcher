   SAN FRANCISCO -- Victims of stock manipulation may use
civil racketeering suits to recover losses, even if the
victims weren't the direct buyers or sellers of the
manipulated securities, a federal appeals court held.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act contains no
limitation that a person damaged by stock manipulation must
be a purchaser or seller of the security.

   The ruling expands the power of the Securities Investor
Protection Corp. to recover damages from brokers and dealers
accused of defrauding customers. Attorneys said the decision
could expand the ability of private investors to file such
suits, too.
   The decision reinstates a 1983 lawsuit against 75 people
accused of conspiring to defraud investors of $14 million
through the manipulation of stock prices in six companies
traded over-the-counter between 1964 and 1981.
   The ruling will allow SIPC to pursue its efforts to
recover the $14 million it had to pay investors when it
liquidated two securities brokerage firms, First State
Securities Corp. and Joseph Sebag Inc.
   Although SIPC wasn't an investor in the allegedly
manipulated securities, it sued for triple damages under
RICO, claiming it had losses as a result of racketeering. A
Los Angeles federal court previously dismissed the claim
because SIPC had neither bought nor sold the manipulated
securities, a usual requirement in stock-fraud suits. But the
appeals court held that RICO didn't contain any such
limitation.
   SIPC was created by Congress in 1970 in the wake of the
collapse of numerous brokerage houses. It was established to
provide protection to customers of brokers and dealers and
members of the national securities exchanges.
   The six firms allegedly involved in the stock manipulation
were: Aero Systems Inc., Aerosonic Corp., Bunnington Corp.,
Creditbank Inc., Dash Industries Inc. and Osrow Products
Corp.
