   One of those hot new "environmental" stocks is taking a
pounding as investors begin to wonder if the company may be
-- gasp -- a polluter itself.
   The infant stock is Horsehead Resources Development, a
zinc recycler that soared and then sank after it sold a 10%
stake to the public last month.

   Horsehead's fate illuminates the fragility of the
small-stock market, which plunged 2.67% Friday based on the
11.43-point drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index. It also shows
that even this year's wildly popular environmental-cleanup
stocks are highly vulnerable to the shifting tides of federal
regulation.
   A darling of the initial-offering crowd little more than a
month ago, Horsehead gave up 1 1/8 in Friday's big market
sell-off to finish at 15 1/2, not far above its $14.50
offering price and down from a recent high above 22.
   Based in the heart of Pennsylvania's steel-making country,
Horsehead sells its recycling service to "mini-mills" that
recover steel from scrap metal. Using intense heat, Horsehead
recovers zinc from a dust created in steelmaking that also
contains dangerous levels of lead and cadmium.
   Horsehead not only resells the recycled zinc, but also
recovers the lead and cadmium in a concentrate and ships it
off for further recycling. All that recycling leaves some
slag, which Horsehead sells to such customers as the
Pennsylvania transportation department, which plans to spread
it on icy winter roads.
   That slag could become a snag, however, at least according
to analyst Debra G. Coy of Washington Analysis Corp., a
subsidiary of County NatWest Securities. In two reports last
month, Ms. Coy cautioned investors that recent court rulings
might result in costly new regulation of the slag.
   Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't
regulate such slag, making zinc recovery and other recycling
businesses much cheaper than the regulated landfill and
waste-treatment sector. In fact, the advantage made the waste
treatment companies so mad they became the unlikely
bedfellows of environmentalists in a court challenge to EPA's
rules.
   "What the hell good does it do to reclaim zinc if in
exchange for that you take the lead, cadmium and chromium and
throw them onto the ground as slag?" demands Richard Fortuna,
executive director of a group of recycling competitors known
as the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council.
   In two court challenges to the EPA, a federal district
appeals court in Washington ruled this summer that the agency
has the authority to regulate the slag and suggested that it
figure out how to do so. It would be "totally irresponsible"
of the EPA to fail to regulate it by year end, Mr. Fortuna
contends.
   With environmentalists and competing companies pressing
for controls on recyclers, Ms. Coy says she thinks the
regulatory risk to Horsehead is "significant." On the other
hand, any increased controls could benefit such commercial
waste treatment companies as Envirosafe and the
exchange-listed Chemical Waste Management, Rollins
Environmental and Environmental Systems, she adds.
   Horsehead is so confident of the safety of its recycling
method that it didn't even mention the court case in its
preliminary offering document. "We didn't believe it to be of
material significance," says chief financial officer Robert
L. Hoguet III. The ruling occurred after the document was
issued, whereupon the company did mention it in the final
offering document, saying that the ruling wouldn't have a
meaningful impact.
   Mr. Hoguet notes that the EPA has accepted the company's
recovery method as the industry standard. For more than two
years, he adds, tests of the iron-rich slag left over from
the recyling have produced "a fraction" of the level of
contaminants considered dangerous by the EPA. "We think {any
new} regulations would have to be based on our technology,"
he says. In a seven-page, single-spaced response to Ms. Coy,
Horsehead noted that it is working on a process in which the
iron-rich slag is further used to recover heavy metals from
waste water.
   The uncertain regulatory outlook, and volatile zinc
prices, scared off one portfolio manager from the initial
offering. Zinc prices have yanked around the stock as much as
Ms. Coy's report. The shares peaked at 22 1/4 in mid-July as
zinc prices climbed amid the prospect of a labor strike.
After a settlement, Horsehead eased in tandem with falling
zinc prices and hovered around 17 and 18 until last week's
market fall.
   Such unpredictability doesn't faze two other mutual fund
managers, Larry Greenberg of the Fidelity Select
Environmental Services Fund and David Beckwith of the Freedom
Environmental Fund. Both participated in the initial
offering, although Mr. Beckwith says he didn't make "a big
bet" with 20,000 shares.
   Mr. Greenberg thinks Horsehead's recycling prowess will
overcome any regulatory obstacles. He estimates the company
will earn 65 cents a share this year and 90 cents a share in
1991. He expects the market will be willing to pay 20 to 25
times next year's earnings for the stock. But he warns
investors to approach all environmental services stocks "with
their eyes open," vigilant for any signs of tighter
regulation.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Following the direction of larger stocks, over-the-counter
shares recovered from a steep plunge early Friday afternoon
but still ended the session with one of the year's largest
losses.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which plummeted more than 20
points early Friday afternoon, dropped 11.43 to 417.46, or
2.67%. Volume jumped to 203.2 million shares from 146.5
million shares Thursday as declining stocks overwhelmed
advancers, 1,818 to 484.
   The cascade of orders swamped some understaffed trading
desks and left some phones unanswered at the height of the
sell-off, according to some traders. Phil Allen, OTC trader
at Howe Barnes in Chicago, said his company was unable to get
through to other brokerage firms on a couple of occasions.
But Mr. Allen added that the OTC market acted admirably,
given the magnitude of the trading.
   The market surveillance section of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates and
regulates the OTC market, said it didn't receive any
complaints about firms not answering phones, according to
NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing. NASD examiners monitored market
makers by telephone early Friday, then moved to the trading
rooms of 19 firms before 2 p.m. EDT to observe trading
activity firsthand, he explained.
   The examiners have been used infrequently in the past, Mr.
Hobbing said, adding that he believes the last time they were
dispatched was after the Oct. 13, 1989, market plunge.
   Intel, the day's most active stock, fell 1 to 39 1/4 on
more than 5.4 million shares. Other active stocks included
some of the OTC market's largest capitalized namesmost of
which are in the technology and telecommunications sectors.
   MCI Communications fell 2 1/4 to 34 1/2 and Apple Computer
tumbled 3 1/4 to 40 1/4 after bucking the trend Thursday with
a 1 1/8-point gain.
   Two market leaders fared better. Sun Microsystems rose 1/4
to 30 3/4 and TeleCommunications was unchanged at 13 1/8.
   Intergraph added 1 to 15 3/4 after the Huntsville, Ala.,
maker of computer graphics systems announced late Thursday
that it plans to buy back five million common shares.
   At Software Toolworks Inc., even positive earnings
couldn't stave off a decline. The company reported operating
earnings for the first quarter ended June 30 jumped to 18
cents a share from six cents a share a year earlier. However,
its stock dropped 1 1/2 to 12 1/8 on 1.9 million shares.
