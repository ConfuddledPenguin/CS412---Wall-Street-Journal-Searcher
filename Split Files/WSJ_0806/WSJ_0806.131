   MADRID -- Iberia Air Lines of Spain said it agreed to buy
37 RB211 engines from Rolls-Royce PLC, a London-based maker
of aircraft engines, for $160 million to equip the Spanish
national carrier's recently expanded fleet of Boeing Co.
757-model planes.
   The deal includes two engines for each of Iberia's 16
Boeing 757s, which the airline bought last May when it
upgraded its fleet. The engines are to be delivered from 1993
to 1994. The transaction also includes five spare engines and
equipment. Iberia's board approved a 104 billion-peseta
($1.06 billion) purchase of Boeing 757 aircraft on May 25.
