   AMERIFIRST BANK (Miami) -- Laurence B. Brody, a Miami
dentist and director of this thrift, was named chairman. Dr.
Brody succeeds M. Lee Pearce, who resigned, he said, because
he felt he could make no "further contribution" to the
thrift's attempts to turn around. Since last spring when Dr.
Pearce became chairman, the bank said, AmeriFirst had adopted
several cost-cutting measures, which "were not enough to
rescue AmeriFirst from its disastrous venture into commercial
real estate."
