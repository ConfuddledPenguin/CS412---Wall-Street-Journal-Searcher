   SEOUL -- South Korea posted a preliminary current-account
surplus of $500 million for July, its first surplus in seven
months.
   The Finance Ministry attributed the turnaround to a
surplus in the visible-trade balance in July. The ministry
estimated the merchandise trade surplus at more than $400
million on a free-on-board basis; the invisible-trade balance
also showed a surplus, estimated at $80 million.
