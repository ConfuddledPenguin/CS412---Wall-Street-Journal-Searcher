   The meeting's so dull
   That when there's a lull,
   It's hard not to notice or mention
   That eyelids are lifting
   On those who were drifting,
   And everyone snaps to attention.

we should be charging them an entertainment fee.

   Sometimes it's difficult to tell if you're the leader of
the pack -- or being chased.
   -- Marlys Huffman.
