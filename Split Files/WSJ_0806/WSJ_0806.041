   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc. reached a revised
agreement to sell interests in four investment partnerships
to Krupp Cos., in an apparent setback to CRI Inc., which has
sought control of the partnerships by another route.
   Integrated is a former real-estate syndicator and
financial-services firm that has been operating under
bankruptcy court protection since February.

   Krupp is a Boston-based investment firm that manages more
than $2 billion in investments, of which more than $1 billion
are mortgage funds similar to the Integrated investments.
   CRI is a real-estate syndicator based in Rockville, Md.
   The agreement in principle between Integrated and Krupp,
for as much as $45 million in cash and notes, would give
Krupp the general-partner interests in the partnerships,
known as American Insured Mortgage Investors. It eliminates a
previous condition, that CRI's competing bid be dropped. CRI
wants to gain control of the partnerships through a proposed
offer for the partnership units.
   At the same time, Integrated obtained a second court order
blocking CRI from proceeding with two lawsuits against it
until Aug. 13. CRI's proposed offer is outside the
court-approved auction of the partnership interests.
Integrated has been seeking to sell assets to satisfy
creditors, who are owed a total of about $1.8 billion.
   "A significant concern of many of the {AIM} investors was
the uncertainty of finding a qualified investment manager to
replace Integrated, and that matter is now resolved," said
Laurence Gerber, president of Krupp.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard C. Buschman III, who is
overseeing Integrated's reorganization proceedings here, also
agreed to consider on Aug. 13 whether to approve Integrated's
revised agreement to sell to Krupp. But he denied a request
by Integrated to stop CRI from proceeding with its exchange
offer for the AIM units, which is pending before the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the revised terms, Krupp agreed to pay Integrated
$28 million in cash, a $10.6 million interest-bearing
promissory note at closing and $6.5 million a year after the
closing. The previous Krupp offer was for $38.6 million in
cash and the $6.5 million a year after closing.
   CRI couldn't be reached for comment.
