   TORONTO -- High interest rates and a strong Canadian
dollar continued to push Canadian corporate profits down in
the second quarter. With economic growth slowing, economists
are debating whether the country has entered a mild
recession.
   In a Wall Street Journal survey of 190 early-reporting
companies, second-quarter operating profits were 2.36 billion
Canadian dollars (US$2.05 billion), down 29% from a year
earlier but up 21% from the first quarter. Six-month
operating earnings were down 34% to C$4.31 billion.

   "It's not exactly a vintage year this year," said Douglas
Peters, chief economist for Toronto-Dominion Bank. "There has
been little positive in all sectors."
   Forestry and manufacturing companies suffered the brunt of
the downward trend, with operating earnings among surveyed
companies down 76% and 39%, respectively, from the previous
year. The mining sector showed signs of recovery after a poor
first quarter, boosted by higher prices for precious metals,
while energy concerns continued to struggle with volatile
world crude oil prices. In all, companies with lower earnings
relative to the 1989 second quarter outnumbered companies
with gains nearly 2 to 1.
   Analysts expect profit declines to continue through the
end of the year. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Burns Fry
Ltd., said she expects corporate earnings to show an 18.5%
decline in the third quarter from a year earlier and an 8.5%
drop in the fourth quarter, resulting in a decline for all of
1990 of about 16%.
   Statistics Canada, the government statistical agency, said
last week that gross domestic product declined 0.2% in May
from April, after recording no change in April. That has most
economists estimating that GDP fell about 0.25%, or 1% on an
annual basis, in the second quarter from the first quarter.
That would represent the first quarterly decline in GDP since
the 1982 fourth quarter.
   Some forecasters see slight growth in the third quarter,
but others say the GDP will fall again, giving Canada its
first technical recession in almost eight years. There is
general agreement that growth will return in the fourth
quarter because Canadian consumers will buy big-ticket items
before a new 7% tax on goods and services takes effect Jan.

   The Bank of Canada's tight monetary policy has widened the
gap between Canadian and U.S. interest rates, and propped up
the Canadian dollar. Three-month Canadian treasury bills are
yielding about 550 basis points more than their U.S.
counterparts, and the Canadian dollar has hit 10-year highs,
reaching 86.90 U.S. cents Friday.
   Analysts say the tight policy has eroded corporate
earnings by quashing exports and stifling consumer spending.
The higher Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar makes
Canadian goods more expensive for U.S. buyers.
   Mr. Peters said the policy has also dealt a major blow to
Canada's competitiveness in the North American market, where
tariffs are being removed under the Canada-U.S. free-trade
agreement that came into effect at the start of 1989.
   "It's very hard to run a marathon with a bullet in each
foot," Mr. Peters said of the effect of the dollar and
interest rates on Canada's early free-trade performance.
   The Bank of Canada is expected to allow rates to ease
slightly through the rest of 1990, with three-month rates
falling below 12.5% from the current 13.17%. The Canadian
dollar should also decline relative to its U.S. counterpart,
but is expected to be at about 85 U.S. cents at year end.
   The Canadian government expects that its new 7% tax will
result in a one-time boost to inflation of 1.25 percentage
points. Analysts say that effect will keep upward pressure on
interest rates through the first half of 1991.
   The forest-products industry was hardest hit in the second
quarter, as profits from 20 companies fell to C$95.9 million
from C$397.8 million a year earlier. Six-month earnings fell
77% to C$184.5 million. Analysts said high interest rates
have slowed construction of new houses on both sides of the
border. As well, the high Canadian dollar has lowered revenue
from exports to the U.S.
   Earnings for Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. dropped
to C$6.6 million in the quarter from C$72.9 million a year
earlier. Noranda Forest Inc. had a loss of C$4 million
compared with earnings of C$68.3 million a year earlier. Both
companies also blamed a depressed pulp market for their
earnings woes.
   Manufacturing profits, hit by the slowdown in consumer
spending, dropped 39% among the 43 companies surveyed, with
second-quarter earnings of C$536.8 million compared with
C$875.8 million in 1989. But excluding Alcan Aluminium Ltd.,
Dofasco Inc. and Ford Motor Co. of Canada, the sector was
down a more modest 13%. Six-month earnings for manufacturers
were down 40% to C$972.2 million.
   Alcan's profit fell 66% to US$84 million, because of lower
prices for its products. Ford Canada, a victim of the auto
industry slowdown, saw its second-quarter earnings fall 54%
to C$54.4 million. Dofasco blamed the high Canadian dollar
for a drop in steel prices and shipments, sending its
earnings down 68% to C$27.7 million.
   Volatile prices have put the mining and petroleum sectors
on an earnings roller coasters in the past four quarters, but
there are signs of recovery. In the mining sector, profits
for 23 companies fell 25% to C$401.3 million in the quarter
and were down 46% to C$652.3 million in the six months. But
the quarterly total was up 60% from the 1990 first quarter.
   Earnings for precious-metal companies were up 2% in the
quarter on the strength of higher world gold prices. The
base-metals companies saw earnings fall 28% in the quarter,
but rise 86% from the first quarter.
   Inco Ltd., a major nickel producer, earned US$203.9
million in the quarter, up 4% from a year earlier. However,
operating results actually fell substantially, because the
latest quarter included a US$112 million after-tax gain from
the sale of part of its interest in P.T. International Nickel
Indonesia.
   The oil and gas sector is expected to be stronger for the
remainder of the year, following recent developments among
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait, as well as an OPEC
agreement in July to set a crude-oil target price of US$21 a
barrel, have raised the prospect of higher oil prices. The
industry has contended with crude prices ranging from about
US$15-US$24 a barrel since the start of the year.
   Profits for 18 energy concerns slipped 42% in the second
quarter, to C$196.6 million, while six-month earnings were
off 20% to C$570.4 million. Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by
Exxon Corp., saw its earnings rise 65% to C$238 million in
the quarter, but the 1990 results include an afte-rtax gain
of about C$195 million from the sale of its stake in
Interhome Energy Inc.
