   The 1990 census will almost certainly show that population
-- and therefore voting power -- is continuing to shift from
the Eastern and Midwestern states to the South and West.
Americans are not just moving toward better weather. They are
escaping from high-tax states to states that let them keep
more of their money.
   The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a
permanent bipartisan body created by Congress in 1959, has
attempted to calculate the state-by-state tax burden. The
commission arrives at its conclusions by dividing each
state's tax base by the actual taxes paid per capita. This
exercise yields an index number of "tax effort" for each
state. An index number above 100 indicates relatively heavy
exploitation of the tax base; an index number below 100
indicates relatively light exploitation.

   The states with the heaviest tax burdens have been losing
population to the states with the lightest. Between 1975 and
1988, New York had the heaviest tax burden in the country --
62.6% above the national average. It also will have lost more
electoral votes between 1972 and 1992 than any other state.
Florida, among the four lowest-tax states over those 13
years, had a tax burden almost 25% below the national
average. Between 1972 and 1992 it gained eight electoral
votes, more than any other state in the nation.
   Altogether, the 10 states whose relative population grew
fastest between 1970 and 1990 -- Nevada, Arizona, Alaska,
Florida, Utah, Texas, California, New Hampshire, New Mexico
and Washington (in that order) -- had a relative tax burden
nearly 12% below the U.S. average. Collectively, those 10
states will have 31 more electoral votes in 1992 than they
did in 1972.
   In contrast, the 10 states that have been losing relative
population fastest -- Iowa, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Illinois, North
Dakota and Indiana -- had tax efforts more than 10% above the
U.S. average. These states will together have lost 29
electoral votes since 1972.
   Taxes seem to depress employment even more than
population. The best 10 states for employment growth --
Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Alaska, New Hampshire, Washington,
Georgia, Vermont, California and Utah -- averaged 77% growth
in the number of jobs between 1974 and 1989. The worst 10 --
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, New York,
Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Montana and Louisiana -- averaged
just 18%. The top 10 job-producing states had a relative tax
effort 6% below the U.S. average. The worst 10 job producers
posted results 4% percent above the national average.
   These grand totals are confirmed by surveys of individual
behavior. A 1989 investigation of emigrants from Michigan in
1984 and 1985 found that 86% percent of the 39,674 tax filers
who moved to another state chose states that had discarded
their separate death or inheritance tax. Because Michigan
maintains its own death taxes, in addition to federal taxes,
a person who has been left a $1 million estate will typically
receive nearly $38,000 less than in most other states.
Michigan also imposes punitive taxation on wealth and income.
It enjoys the dubious distinction of the highest unemployment
insurance premiums of any of the nation's 15 most populous
states -- largely because it pays weekly benefits $50 higher
than the national average. This is tantamount to an
employment tax.
   The superior population and employment growth of low-tax
states is unaffected by size or region. Small low-tax states,
such as Arizona and Colorado, do just as well as big low
tax-states, such as Florida and California. Low-tax states in
the North, such as New Hampshire, do just as well as low-tax
states in the South, such as Georgia.
   If deductibility of state and local taxes is capped, as
has been suggested in Washington's budget negotiations, high
income-tax states, such as New York and Massachusetts, would
experience disproportionately great capital flight because
the effective marginal tax rate on income in those states
would escalate dramatically. The Heartland Institute in
Chicago confirms that for each 1% increase in a state's tax
effort relative to the national average, personal income
growth in that state will fall behind the U.S. average by
0.6% per year.
   Americans are voting with their feet. States that are
dreading the results of the current census can easily, then,
improve their performance on the one coming in 2000 simply by
cutting taxes.
