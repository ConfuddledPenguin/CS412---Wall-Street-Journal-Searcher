   The Justice Department threatened to block Procter &amp;
Gamble Co.'s plans to market Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s
Maalox antacid because the pact violates antitrust laws.
   The joint marketing pact would make P&amp;G, which makes Pepto
Bismol, the biggest player in the U.S. over-the-counter
stomach remedies market, which could "substantially lessen
competition," said James F. Rill, assistant attorney general
at the Justice Department's antitrust division.

   The pact could result in higher prices for consumers, he
said. "This lack of market competition would generally harm
consumers nationwide," Mr. Rill said.
   Federal prosecutors said they will file a civil antitrust
suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to challenge the
pact. P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said they disagree with the
department's conclusion and are assessing their alternatives,
but declined to elaborate.
   In March, P&amp;G acquired the U.S. marketing and distribution
rights to a variety of Rorer Group Inc.'s over-the-counter
drugs, such as Perdiem, a laxative, and Ascriptin, a
combination analgesic-antacid.
   The Cincinnati consumer products company had tried to
acquire all of Rorer's over-the-counter drug business, but
was rebuffed. Earlier this year, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of Paris,
a chemical company, merged most of its drug business with
Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
   The Maalox marketing alliance was considered a coup for
P&amp;G's drug business because it gave the company the leading
antacid without the high costs of developing a new brand.
Rorer, in turn, would receive payments from P&amp;G and gain
rights to develop and market certain P&amp;G prescription drugs.
   Rorer says Maalox has a U.S. antacid market share of about
15%, but the brand has faced stiff competition from rivals
Tums and Mylanta.
   Justice department officials estimate that 1989 sales of
over-the-counter stomach remedies were more than $900
million. P&amp;G and Rorer had combined sales in that market of
more than $236 million, officials said.
