   TORONTO -- The chairman and chief executive officer of
Central Capital Corp., Peter Cole, unexpectedly resigned from
the financial services and real estate concern to "seek other
opportunities."
   Thomas Hodgson, vice president of Central Capital, said
the board hadn't had an opportunity to appoint a successor to
Mr. Cole, 53 years old, who had been chief executive for five
years.

   Mr. Hodgson said he wasn't aware of Mr. Cole's plans or
the specific reasons for his resignation. "There certainly
weren't any corporate developments that triggered this," he
said. "If there had been any problems at the company, he
wouldn't have left."
   Mr. Cole said in a statement that he oversaw the building
of Central Capital into a major player in the Canadian
financial services industry and that he thought it was "an
appropriate time to move on." He also said he will remain a
director of Central Capital and be a consultant to the
company. Mr. Cole couldn't be reached to elaborate.
   During Mr. Cole's tenure as chief executive, Mr. Hodgson
said, the company's own assets grew from 3.5 billion Canadian
dollars (US$3.04 billion) to C$16 billion, with another C$20
billion in fiduciary assets under management. This aggressive
growth has made Central Capital one of the major non-bank
participants in Canada's financial services industry.
   Among other acquisitions, Mr. Cole oversaw the C$420
million purchase of Trader's Group Ltd. in 1987, which gave
Central Capital control of what now is Central Guaranty Trust
Co. and Canadian General Insurance Co.
   But the aggressive expansion left the company with a debt
of about C$1.4 million by the end of 1989, which resulted in
one of the company's two major shareholders, the financier
Reuben Cohen, taking the unusual step of publicly challenging
Mr. Cole at the annual meeting in April to improve Central
Capital's performance. Mr. Cohen voiced concern about the
company's debt and said he wanted to see its net income
increase from C$92.2 million in 1989 to $200 million by 1993.
   In the first quarter, Central Capital earned C$11.1
million, or 10 Canadian cents a share, down from C$28.2
million, or 34 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
   Mr. Hodgson said Leonard Ellen, Central Capital vice
chairman and, with Mr. Cohen, one of the major shareholders,
will step in to run the company on an interim basis as the
board's executive committee chairman. Messrs. Cohen and Ellen
together hold a 60.5% voting stake in Central Capital.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, Central
Capital common shares closed at C$8.50, down 25 Canadian
cents, and Class A shares closed at C$6.50, down 38 Canadian
cents.
