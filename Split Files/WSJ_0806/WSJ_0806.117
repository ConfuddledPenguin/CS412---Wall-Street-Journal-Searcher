   BUSH WEIGHED military moves against Iraq and sent Cheney
to Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad said it had begun pulling its troops out of
Kuwait, but Bush called the claim a lie. He said the U.S. and
its allies wouldn't accept the Iraqi-installed "puppet
regime" in Kuwait, and declared that Arab leaders had failed
to resolve the situation. The president refused to rule out
the use of military force against Iraq, and he dispatched the
defense secretary to Saudi Arabia for talks. U.S.
intelligence officials told the White House of signs Iraq is
preparing to seize the neutral zone south of Kuwait or to
invade Saudi Arabia itself, according to officials familiar
with the reports. The Saudis deployed 200 to 300 tanks near
to Kuwait, according to one report. Japan and the EC imposed
an oil embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, and Moscow cut off arms
shipments to Baghdad and ordered weapons ships en route to
Iraq to reverse course.

   MARINES EVACUATED more than 60 Americans from Liberia's
capital.
   Bush ordered the helicopter shuttle operation after a
rebel leader threatened to begin arresting foreigners in
order to provoke intervention in the eight-month civil war.
The Americans were ferried to the helicopter carrier Saipan,
while a Marine contingent reinforced security around the U.S.
Embassy in Monrovia. A Pentagon spokesman said the Marines
are prepared to evacuate more U.S. citizens if they want to
leave. There were reports out of Gambia that West African
leaders were expected at a summit today to give Nigeria a
go-ahead to intervene in the Liberian conflict.
   White House spokesman Fitzwater said, "The Marine presence
does not indicate or constitute any intention on the part of
the U.S. government to intervene militarily in the Liberian
conflict."

priorities on it.
