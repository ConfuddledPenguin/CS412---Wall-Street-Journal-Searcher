   TOKYO -- Twenty-five years after Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., the world's largest consumer electronics
maker, quit the computer market, the company is gearing up to
re-enter the fray.
   Consumer electronics makers must move aggressively into
the computer field, Matsushita's president, Akio Tanii, says
about the changing face of the industry.

   With the line between consumer and industrial electronics
becoming blurred and with computer functions being
incorporated into household electronics products to control
them, Matsushita must evolve into a diversified electronics
maker, Mr. Tanii says.
   "Matsushita's emphasis on electronics for the home won't
change," Mr. Tanii asserts. "We have no intention of making
mainframes. We won't become an IBM."
   But as word processors, fascimile machines and personal
computers move from the workplace to the home, Matsushita
will adapt to supply the mass market, Mr. Tanii says.
   Matsushita, whose consolidated sales of National and
Panasonic brand name products were $37.8 billion in fiscal
1989, is stressing six growth sectors, including information
and communication equipment, factory automation and
semiconductors, on its road to diversification.
   "The audio-visual sector will continue to be what people
think of first when they think of Matsushita," Mr. Tanii
said. But with telecommunications equipment such as
computers, telephones, facsimiles and word processors
increasingly merging with audio-visual equipment, Matsushita
must stress those fields as well, he says.
   Electronics industry analysts say the move into industrial
electronics is a good one, as expectations of 10% growth for
that sector in fiscal 1990 and 1991 are far higher than the
zero to 3% growth forecast for the consumer electronics
sector.
   Matsushita's results for the latest fiscal year point to
the company's change in direction. While sales of video
equipment, one of the company's traditional areas of
emphasis, grew just 2% in the latest fiscal year,
communication and industrial equipment sales of products such
as personal computers, word processors, printers and factory
automation equipment rose 24%.
   "We're aiming to maintain that level of growth," says
Hiroyuki Mizuno, executive vice president in charge of
Research and Development.
   Matsushita's chief spokesman, Akira Nagano, said the
company's shift into new sectors has lowered the proportion
of traditional consumer electronics sales to 45% of the total
in 1989 from 58% in 1985.
   Despite the changes to date, Matsushita's efforts so far
have left many industry analysts unconvinced the company is
successfully adapting to changes in the industry.
   Some assert that the giant electronics maker is too big
and bureaucratic to keep pace with changing trends. Many say
Matsushita's strategy of using superior mass production
capabilities and an extensive sales network to dominate
markets pioneered by smaller, more innovative companies may
no longer work in today's market.
   "With the consumer electronics market flattening out,
they've got to become more innovative," said one analyst.
   Analysts' coolness is partly a reflection on Matsushita's
ability to buy its way into growth sectors. With $21.4
billion in cash and short-term securities on hand, analysts
see great potential for the company to acquire established
companies in its chosen growth sectors.
   But the company's stance concerning acquisitions remains
cautious. "If a good opportunity materializes, we will study
the possibility" but Matsushita has no concrete plans about
further acquisitions at present, Mr. Tanii said.
   He says acquisitions will be considered only if they can
help the company achieve its goals more efficiently than can
be done through internal development.
   That caution has prompted industry watchers to urge
Matsushita to take greater risks and move more decisively to
ensure future growth.
   But Matsushita's top management says its restructuring is
already well under way, positioning the company to remain a
leader in the next generation of home electronics.
"Matsushita has already changed a great deal," says Mr.
Mizuno, noting that communication and industrial equipment
will soon account for 25% of Matsushita's total sales, up
from 17% in 1985. And the company has the potential for
further dramatic change, he said.
   "It's far too early to write off Matsushita as a stodgy
old company that can't change," says Martin Berrisford,
electronics sector analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in
Tokyo.
   The company's push into the semiconductor and electronics
components sector has been well received by industry
watchers. Sales grew 8% in the latest fiscal year to 781.2
billion yen (US$5.23 billion) and Matsushita officials said
the dawn of the semiconductor-intensive high-definition
television, HDTV, era could boost the company from sixth
place in memory production to first.
   But while the company's semiconductor outlook appears
strong, many analysts doubt that Matsushita can wrest a
substantial enough chunk of the computer market from the
industry front-runners to boost the company's growth.
   Mr. Mizuno, the head of Matsushita's research and
development efforts, says such views ignore the changes
sweeping the computer industry. "Up till now, computer makers
have concentrated on closed architecture with proprietary
operating systems, forcing customers to rely on a limited
number of makers to build their information networks," Mr.
Mizuno says.
   "But that day is ending," Mr. Mizuno says, and the
companies that dominated the old era won't necessarily
dominate the coming era.
   The rise of open architecture, with computer makers
adapting their machines to a common operating system, will
pave the way for greater standardization, allowing computers
to become a mass market product, the Matsushita executive
says.
   Currently, Matsushita's computer operations have just
begun, officials say. "We are still just beginning to study"
the options, according to Mr. Tanii, the company's president.
By one estimate, sales of computers and work stations
accounted for just 10% of Matsushita's sales of
communications and industrial products during the latest
fiscal year, or just under 2.5% of the company's total sales.
   But "when computers become a {standardized} home
electronics product, Matsushita will be the number one
computer maker, Mr. Mizuno predicts confidently.
   Matsushita's first giant step into the computer field will
be HDTV, company officials said.
