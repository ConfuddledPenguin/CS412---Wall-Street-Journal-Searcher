   The U.S. military's decade-long campaign to reverse the
one-way flow of technology to Japan has been stalled by
persistent bureaucratic snafus, government and industry
officials said.
   The major obstacle to sharing defense technology appears
to be U.S. government inertia. Even U.S. officials admit that
the Defense Department has been slow to make crucial
personnel decisions, submit specific requests for cooperation
to Japan and respond to feelers from Tokyo.

   "It continues to be a very low priority for the Pentagon,"
says Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), chairman of a Senate
Armed Services subcommittee advocating closer U.S.-Japanese
cooperation. "The military still has the general attitude
that if it's worth knowing, we pretty much know it here."
   Sen. Bingaman's committee recently tried to jump-start the
process by authorizing more than $20 million for cooperative
research between the two nations. But despite encouragement
from major U.S. defense contractors, the record is one of
missed opportunities.
   In spite of growing concern about America's dependence on
Japan for basic security needs, no new technology transfer
projects have been discussed for nearly two years. That is
when the last meeting of the main bilateral forum overseeing
Japan's efforts took place. A session was scheduled for last
month, but was delayed, until November at the earliest,
officials familiar with the process say.
   U.S. defense officials complain that they are preoccupied
with more pressing matters these days, such as trying to
salvage their budget in the post-Cold War era. But the issue
of U.S. technology ties to Japan -- both military and
commercial -- will grow only more urgent.
   Recent Defense Department studies have warned of Japan's
growing control of crucial military technologies. The flap
over the FSX fighter plane last year stemmed from growing
U.S. fear that Japan was taking U.S. military technology to
build its industrial base, while the U.S. was getting little
in return.
   Overall, Japan had a 126 billion yen (US$844 million)
technology transfer deficit with the U.S. in 1988, according
to a study released last week by Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, or MITI. The same study
showed that Japan sends 10 times more researchers to U.S.
labs than the number of U.S. researchers it hosts. The
ministry, sensitive to charges of technology sponging, says
it is drafting policies to encourage Japanese companies to
share their research, patents and licenses.
   U.S. military interest in tapping Japan's technology
started more than a decade ago, as it became clear the
Japanese wanted to develop their own independent advanced
weaponry. In 1980, the two sides set up the Systems and
Technology Forum. From that came then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's 1983 decision to exempt the U.S. from a post-war
ban on military exports, and to encourage the flow of
"dual-use" technologies, which have commercial and martial
applications.
   But since the first official steps toward that goal,
efforts by the two sides have generated little more than
paperwork. "Things didn't happen as I expected at the time,"
says Hiroo Kinoshita, who spearheaded Japan's technology
transfer activities in the 1980s at Japan's Defense Agency
and at MITI.
   The biggest reason for lack of recent progress appears to
be disarray at the Defense Department. The deputy
undersecretary for international programs is officially
responsible for such matters, but the post has been filled by
a temporary appointee since October. The result, critics say,
is that technology-sharing has been left in the lap of
mid-level bureaucrats who lack the clout to get things done.
   Many Pentagon officials also say the government, despite
making general noises about wanting more technology from
Japan, rarely makes specific requests. "If they know what
they want to receive, they could ask for it," says Mr.
Kinoshita. He notes that "people from DOD have their own
programs" and "If they allow the transfer of technology from
Japan, it will become unnecessary."
   Many U.S. government officials privately concur. "DOD is
really punting on this," says one U.S. official closely
involved in the process.
   Philosophical differences, meanwhile, split the two
nations. The Japanese are proposing joint development in
specialized areas where the two nations are probably even,
according to U.S. officials. But the U.S. is targeting basic
technologies where the Japanese have a clear lead, with the
objective of getting U.S. companies steeped in those
practices.
   Indeed, many Japanese companies still have "a lingering
reluctance to get involved in a project, particularly if it
involves any public attention to Japanese technology going
into weapons development," says James E. Auer, who recently
retired from the Defense Department, and now runs a center
for U.S.-Japan studies at Vanderbilt University.
   U.S. companies say Japan is very slow about turning over
dual-use technologies, and some U.S. Defense Department
officials say they complained last year to MITI that Japan
was blocking such exports.
   The FSX agreement, finally signed earlier this year, was
the first major technology-sharing project. While most of the
attention focused on U.S. transfers to Japan, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd. did agree to share a handful of its
proprietary technologies with General Dynamics Corp. But
experts in both countries believe it was such a painful
process that it might damage prospects for major technology
sharing.
   "With the FSX, we tried to do too much too soon," Sen.
Bingaman notes. "Concentrating on cooperative agreements on a
smaller scale," he adds, "can build trust" while providing
"practical economic and military benefits for both
countries."
   A few smaller-scale projects have been discussed. One of
the first official projects involving surface-to-air missile
technology fell apart after Toshiba Corp., the developer, was
blacklisted by the U.S. government for a subsidiary's
technology sale to the Soviet Union. The Japanese
subsequently did turn over to the U.S. know-how in two cases
involving naval ship repair.
   The last official meeting of the Systems and Technology
Forum was in October 1988, though it was originally supposed
to take place every six months. During that session, Japan
presented a list of five technologies it wanted to codevelop
with the U.S. The Americans expressed interest in three of
the proposals: rocket engines, missile seekers, and
detection-shields for submarines. The two sides have
exchanged notes but have done little work since.
   During a February visit to Tokyo, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney handed the Japanese a list of general
technologiescomposite materials, large-scale integrated
circuits, gallium arsenide semiconductors, artificial
intelligence, phased-array radar, and genetic engineering --
that the U.S. wants better access to. But there has been no
official followup, U.S. and Japanese officials say.
