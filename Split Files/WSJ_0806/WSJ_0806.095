   WASHINGTON -- The $289 billion Pentagon spending bill
approved by the Senate relegates Star Wars research, once the
leading symbol of America's military buildup in the 1980s, to
the back burner.
   Reversing six years of solid bipartisan support, the
Senate voted by a surprisingly large 54-44 margin to
effectively bar deployment of any proposed space-based
anti-missile system for at least a decade -- and probably
much longer. Lawmakers for the first time imposed strict
spending limits and long-range priorities on the program's
various technologies, thereby frustrating Bush administration
hopes of beginning in the next few years to put up thousands
of small rockets -- dubbed Brilliant Pebbles -- designed to
provide a shield against Soviet or Third World missiles.

   While still earmarking $3.67 billion for the overall
research program, now called the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the vote nevertheless reflects fundamental
changes in Congress's fiscal and strategic view of the world.
Despite loud complaints from the Pentagon, strong objections
from Senate Republican leaders and even hints of a veto, the
Senate essentially decided to turn the program into another
long-term research effort -- one that most likely will be
forced to fight further cuts year after year.
   "We're still fighting the . . . Cold War with Reagan
relics," asserted longtime SDI critic Sen. Tom Harkin (D.,
Iowa), "and SDI is the biggest relic of them all." Sen. Jeff
Bingaman (D., N.M.) who led the fight to reshape the
program's goals, complained during the debate that lawmakers
over the years gave SDI managers "a blank check" because it
remained "the only area in the defense budget {lacking}
direction from Congress." Before the vote, Sen. Bingaman
blasted the Pentagon for pursuing "the craziness" of seeking
early deployment.
   SDI's problems have been building for a long time. Since
the mid-1980s, Pentagon brass have shifted gears several
times as to what would be the most effective network of
space-based and land-based interceptors. Congressional
investigators and Air Force auditors have complained about
inadequate financial controls. Just last month, the Senate
Armed Services Committee's report on the authorization bill
for the fiscal year starting in October complained that
members don't "endorse an arbitrary deadline" embraced by the
White House for shifting Brilliant Pebbles from the
laboratory into space.
   But above all, the Senate's turnabout was evident in the
comments of moderate and pro-defense Democrats, including
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),
who steadfastly has supported the Pentagon on the issue but
this time voted to clip its wings. "No one can tell you where
the money is coming from, and yet they're charging straight
ahead" toward deployment, Sen. Nunn said.
   Even the Senate's rejection of amendments calling for
deeper overall SDI spending cuts is likely to be a
short-lived victory for the White House. Support for the
program is considerably weaker in the House, which could
reduce SDI funding to about $2 billion for next fiscal year.
The administration requested nearly $4.7 billion for fiscal
1991, but even supporters conceded that SDI outlays would
have to climb to twice that level by the mid-1990s in order
to seriously consider deploying actual hardware.
   Leading the battle for the administration, Sen. Malcolm
Wallop (R., Wyo.) said too many lawmakers are "in absolute
terror of coming to grips with the reality . . . of building
real systems to help real people." The new restrictions on
the program, he said, ensure that "near-term promises will be
put on the shelf for long-term promises, which will then be
put on the shelf again for longer-term promises."
   Sen. Bingaman and Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), the
other leading proponent of restructuring the program, contend
that their approach is the only way to retain robust SDI
funding. But the administration and its congressional
supporters have noted that laboratories and research
facilities in the two states Sens. Bingaman and Shelby
represent are bound to benefit the most from the changes.
   The defense bill, approved by bleary-eyed senators
Saturday afternoon after they slogged through more than 100
amendments and came back to the Senate floor following a
marathon session lasting into the early morning hours, also
reaches out in some other new directions. Paving the way for
the deepest cuts in military spending since the end of World
War II, the measure withholds production or full-scale
development money for four of the Pentagon's major aircraft
programs, seeks to cut 100,000 troops from the active-duty
force by the fall of 1991, and leaves in limbo further
spending on mobile MX missiles and the Navy's superquiet
Seawolf attack submarines.
   The bill also continues production of the B-2 Stealth
bomber if the plane passes radar-eluding tests. And it
provides the most extensive proposals since the mid-1960s to
enhance reserve forces and provide medical, financial and
other assistance for officers and troops being forced out of
the military for budget reasons. The Senate also rejected
efforts to limit spending on anti-satellite weapons, mothball
additional battleships, and shift money from the Pentagon for
drug treatment and other social programs.
