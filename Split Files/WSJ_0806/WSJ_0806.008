   MORE FAILURES are predicted for SBA-backed investment
firms.
   So far this year, 26 companies in the Small Business
Administration's Small Business Investment Company (SBICs)
have gone into liquidation, double the program's annual
average. "I think we may have a tripling or quadrupling of
liquidations. . . . That's even more reason to get on top of
this now," Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), chairman of the
Senate Small Business Committee, said at a hearing.

   "I really think the economy is going into the toilet, and
small business will be affected first," he said. SBICs are
SBA-sponsored venture-capital concerns. Despite giving
successful companies like Cray Research Inc. and Nike Inc.
their starts, almost a third of all SBICs ever licensed have
gone into liquidation. As previously reported, the 170
investment firms now in liquidation owe the government more
than $500 million. The SBA is recovering only 40% to 50% of
that debt, compared with 64% in past years.
   Sen. Bumpers, however, praised SBA Administrator Susan
Engeleiter for taking forceful action to control the mounting
losses from the SBIC program. Ms. Engeleiter said the program
wouldn't look so troubled if losses over the years had been
written off appropriately. She outlined a detailed salvage
program that includes installing new top managers in the
investment division and tightening auditing and
asset-valuation procedures for SBICs. In June, she also
declared a 90-day moratorium on licensing new investment
firms.
   Until recently, the SBA had only five staffers handling
SBIC liquidations for a caseload requiring 50 people by
private industry standards. Seven more positions recently
were approved.

   TREE PLANTING through the SBA gets a boost in Congress.
   The House Small Business Committee approved an amendment
to permit the SBA to spend $180 million over the next four
years to plant trees on public land. Under the measure, the
SBA would grant funds to state and local governments, which
would contract with small firms for the work. Companies that
agree to pick up 25% of the cost would be the preferred
contractors, but the contribution could be met in-kind by
performing care and maintenance of the trees, for example.
   Committee member Rep. Andy Ireland (R., Fla.), led an
effort to ax the tree provision, arguing the program doesn't
belong at the SBA. "At a time when we can't find extra money
for international trade or minority-business programs, he
feels we shouldn't have the agency spending a lot of money to
plant trees," says an aide.
   The amendment's sponsor, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa), won
adoption of the SBA-run tree effort in 1983 as part of
emergency jobs legislation and has fought to revive the
program each year since. The Senate Small Business Committee
doesn't have a similar proposal so far.
   Rep. Smith defends his plan to have the SBA branch out:
"It's the best way the government can carry out the
president's request" to plant more trees.

   SOUR GRAPES: The wine industry, in which small family
businesses predominate, is up in arms about another tax
proposal. As part of a proposed excise tax on alcoholic
beverages under consideration in White House-congressional
budget talks, federal taxes on a bottle of wine would
increase from three cents to 76 cents, according to the
Washington-based National Wine Coalition. No one is claiming
credit for the idea, which coalition executive director John
Volpe believes to be a Bush administration proposal.
Meanwhile, the federal government still is considering
raising the occupational tax on wineries to $19,000 from
$500. The two tax proposals combined, Mr. Volpe says, would
be devastating for the nation's 1,300 wineries.

   TRAINING EMPLOYEES of small companies is the aim of a bill
just introduced by Rep. Joseph McDade (R., Pa.), the ranking
Republican on the House Small Business Committee. The measure
would offer a small business a tax credit of up to 30% of its
investment (over a base amount) in formal training programs.
The base amount is determined as a percentage of the average
payroll over three years. Workers employed by small firms are
only one-third as likely as other employees to receive formal
training, according to the SBA. Labor Department studies have
found that the informal training often provided by small
businesses is ineffective, Mr. McDade says.

   MINORITY FIRMS seek to overcome a Supreme Court ruling on
set-asides.
   Advocates are asking Congress for legislation to get
around a 1989 decision in which the high court said state and
local governments must have specific evidence of
discrimination to justify business set-aside programs for
minorities and women. The ruling has resulted in court
challenges to such programs and the cancellation of many
others, advocates of the programs told a Senate subcommittee.
   The court said local governments can do studies to prove a
history of bias, but such efforts are expensive. A recent
study for the city of Atlanta documented "every form of
marketplace discrimination," said consultant and economist
Andrew Brimmer. These included discrimination in bonding,
financing and denial of a chance to bid on contracts, he
said.
   Former Maryland Rep. Parren Mitchell, who for years headed
the House Small Business Committee, called for legislation
authorizing states and localities to enact strong contracting
programs to aid women and minorities. There is a "sharp, hard
color line" affecting all facets of enterprise, he told the
subcommittee hearings. Ray Marshall, former labor secretary
in the Carter administration, suggested that cities and
states establish a pre-contract rating system. It would give
extra credit to contractors that work with minority and
female-owned firms.
   Blacks, who made up 12.3% of the population and 10.2% of
employment last year, took in only a third of 1% of business
receipts, Mr. Marshall said.
