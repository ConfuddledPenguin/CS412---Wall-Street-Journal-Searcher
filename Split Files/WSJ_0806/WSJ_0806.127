   NEW YORK -- The Big Apple, long the heart of the
securities world, could lose a plum Wall Street tenant.
   Morgan Stanley Group Inc. is seriously weighing a move
from New York to Connecticut when its lease expires in 1997,
people familiar with the firm said.

   In an effort to cut costs, the big securities firm
recently has been looking at office space in Stamford and
Norwalk, among other cites, the people said.
   But some analysts say Morgan Stanley may be posturing.
They point to Dreyfus Corp., the mutual-fund group that last
year rattled the city's cage by threatening to leave New York
for New Jersey. Dreyfus finally won some last-minute tax
concessions and remained in New York.
   Morgan Stanley may end up moving some of its operations
outside the city, analysts say. But it would be impractical
for the firm to leave New York entirely.
   "Maybe they'll set up a nominal office . . . as a place to
stop on the way to the golf course," says John Keefe, a
securities-industry analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New
York. But leaving the city altogether would "be taking
themselves out of the flow" of client contacts and market
information, Mr. Keefe says.
   Morgan Stanley declined to comment on its plans.
   The firm currently has about 4,100 of its 6,800 employees
world-wide in six locations in New York, including an
operations office in Brooklyn. Some Morgan Stanley employees
privately say they aren't thrilled with the prospect of
leaving New York.
   But any move would be a blow to New York, which already is
reeling from sharp cutbacks in the securities and retailing
industries. Since the October 1987 stock-market crash, the
number of securities-industry employees in New York has
fallen 14% to 139,700, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   Connecticut isn't Morgan Stanley's only target. The firm
will scour other cites outside New York, industry executives
said. But the firm's next step, they said, is to take an
option on some land in Connecticut to get a sense of the
fixed costs involved.
