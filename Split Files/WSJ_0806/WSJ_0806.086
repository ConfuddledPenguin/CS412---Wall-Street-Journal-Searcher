   HONG KONG -- In one of the richest building sales since
the local property market slump began more than a year ago,
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. has agreed to sell a 44-story
office tower to a former subsidiary of Bond Corp. Holdings
Ltd. for 1.72 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$221 million).
   The bluechip landlord, which controls much of Hong Kong's
prime office space, purchased the building's site at the
colony's first land auction in 1841 through the antecedents
of its parent, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd.

   Hongkong Land's managing director, Alasdair Morrison, said
the sale of the World Trade Centre in the Causeway Bay
shopping district is part of the company's strategy to
concentrate on properties in Hong Kong's core business
district and pursue other investment opportunities. While it
has indicated intentions to expand in Thailand, he said the
group doesn't have any specific projects in mind.
   Analysts said Hongkong Land is likely initially to use a
portion of the cash to pay off a portion of its debt,
estimated around HK$6 billion, and may apply part to buy back
its sharply undervalued shares in the market, once such a
move is permitted probably later this year by local
regulators.
