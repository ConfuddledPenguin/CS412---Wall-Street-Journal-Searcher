   ROME -- Italy's foreign trade account swung to a surplus
of 1.25 trillion lire ($1.07 billion) in June from a deficit
of 728 billion lire a year earlier and from a 2.495
trillion-lira gap in May, Istat, the state statistical
office, said.
   Istat also said the trade balance in the first six months
of this year showed a deficit of 11.256 trillion lire,
compared with a 14.27 trillion-lira deficit a year earlier.
The trade statistics are provisional and aren't seasonally
adjusted.
