   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge lambasted U S West Inc. for
withholding documents from the Justice Department in a probe
of the company's sale of switching services to the federal
government.
   Judge Harold Greene said, "U S West has been engaged in a
systematic and calculated effort to frustrate the
department's legitimate demands for information, frequently
by patently frivolous and usually dilatory maneuvers." He
continued: "Indeed, in many respects, U S West's legal basis
for withholding documents or objecting to testimony was
entirely without legal foundation, factual basis, or both."

   Judge Greene, who oversees the consent decree that broke
up the Bell System in 1984, made the remarks in an order last
week setting up procedures for U S West to turn over certain
documents to Justice Department investigators.
   In January, the Justice Department whittled down its
request to 108 documents, and U S West decided that 23 could
be handed over, at least in part.
   A U S West spokesman said the Denver-based company has
turned over "at least 60,000 documents to the Justice
Department. The order covers 108, an infinitesimal number of
documents." U S West, he said, believes that most of those
documents are confidential.
   Judge Greene's decision in the documents dispute could be
appealed, but the company hasn't decided whether to take that
step, the spokesman said. He declined to discuss the overall
investigation or alleged improprieties in obtaining
government contracts for switching services.
   The scope of the investigation hasn't been disclosed, but
for the past three years, the agency, which has enforcement
authority for the Bell consent decree, has been looking into
alleged irregularities in switching service contracts between
U S West and the General Services Administration.
   At least part of the investigation involves switching
contracts awarded in 1987, a job that was a precursor to
construction of FTS-2000, the multibillion-dollar contract to
upgrade the federal government's long-distance
telecommunications system. That contract was split between
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and U S Sprint
Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.
Last year, a GSA engineer pleaded guilty to accepting meals
from BellSouth Corp. during the bidding process for the
switching contracts. BellSouth wasn't charged.
   In the U S West matter, Judge Greene said that two years
ago, the company "withheld hundreds of documents," claiming
they were confidential. For the past two years, he said, "U S
West has engaged in a calculated effort to delay compliance
with the department's request by a variety of tactics, in the
main related to claims of privilege." Later, when some
documents were delivered to the department, he said, "it
became apparent that there never had been a basis for the
claims of privilege."
   The judge also criticized U S West's assertion of
confidentiality when Justice Department lawyers began
deposing U S West employees. The company, he said,
"instructed witnesses not to answer even though the
information had already been disclosed in substantial part in
other documents or testimony."
   The court order said U S West already has disclosed
attorney-client communications on four topics, and thus has
waived its claim of privilege on those subjects. The topics
include a U S West decision that it didn't discriminate by
charging AT&amp;T and the GSA different rates for certain
services, and the application of special access surcharges to
private lines used in connection with switching services.
   For remaining documents, the judge ordered both sides to
work out an agreement, and he told U S West that "in view of
its past indefensible dilatory conduct," the company has the
burden of explaining in detail why disputed documents should
remain secret.
   The document squabble follows a Nynex Corp. indictment May
31 on one count of criminal contempt for violating the Bell
consent decree by providing information services through its
tiny Telco Research Corp. unit. The Justice Department
charged that Telco, a software company, provided MCI
Communications Corp. with computer services used to find the
cheapest way to configure telecommunications networks for big
corporate customers.
   Both matters are being handled by the department's special
task force to examine allegations of illegal activity by the
seven Baby Bells. At the time of the Nynex indictment,
Constance Robinson, who heads the task force, said the unit
was investigating other regional phone companies.
