   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Barrister Information Systems Corp. said
it signed the first contract for its law firm management
system software after four years of development.
   A spokesman for the integrated computer-based information
systems concern said the deal with the Hartford, Conn.-based
Halloran &amp; Sage law firm is "not financially significant" but
added that the company expects the software to be a
multimillion-dollar business. Barrister had a loss of $6.5
million on revenue of $29.1 million in the year ended March
31.
