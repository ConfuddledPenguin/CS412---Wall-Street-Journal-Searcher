   At a restaurant in Amman, the Jordanian capital, Dawood
Ibrahim is so agitated he spills Turkish coffee in his lap.
   "Every true Arab is for Saddam Hussein, except prostitutes
and emirs," says the businessman. To prove his point, he
polls passing waiters, and diners at adjoining tables. The
vote is unanimous. "You see," he says, "we are all soldiers
for Saddam now."

   The view from a sidewalk cafe in Cairo is precisely the
opposite. "We all know Saddam is the son of a dog," says Atif
Khalid, who like many Egyptians worked in Iraq during its war
with Iran. A dozen men bang tables to show their assent. "If
he comes here," shouts one, "we will cut his throat."
   Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait has sundered the Arab
world, separating two of America's closest allies in the
region and pushing the Middle East toward further conflict.
While Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak leads a
campaign-backed by Saudi Arabia and Syria -- to condemn and
contain the Iraqi leader, Jordan has thrown itself into the
Iraqi camp, joined by the Palestine Liberation Organization
and Libya.
   The rift bodes poorly for American influence in the region
and confirms what leaders across the Arab world have been
warning: that U.S. neglect of moderates such as Mr. Mubarak
has paved the way for Iraqi extremism.
   "Demagoguery plays to the gallery. Moderation doesn't play
unless it brings results," says Tahseen Bashir, a veteran
Egyptian diplomat. "We were bringing home empty baskets."
   In Jordan, where the population is half Palestinian, the
failure of both diplomacy and the Palestinian uprising to
gain any ground has bred despair, and fervent
anti-Americanism. The almost unanimous view of both officials
and ordinary people is that strong leadership and a strong
show of force is now the only way to break the stalemate.
   Saddam Hussein has become the symbol of that defiance.
Jordanians appear remarkably unconcerned by both the plight
of Kuwait, and Mr. Hussein's brutality at home and abroad.
"We do not have the luxury to concern ourselves with
democratic niceties," says Hazem Nuseibeh, a veteran
Jordanian diplomat. "The need for Arab unity and pride
overrides all that."
   Jordanian officials repeatedly liken Mr. Hussein to Otto
von Bismarck, who unified Germany with iron and blood. If Mr.
Hussein needs oil and territory to advance Arab nationalism,
so be it. Many Jordanians go so far as to suggest that Iraqi
tanks would be welcome in Amman.
   "The colonial powers vivisected the Arab world to make us
weak," says Mr. Nuseibeh, voicing a common view. Adds Deeb
Marji, a member of Parliament: "If Saddam can put the Arab
map together again, who will regret what he did in Kuwait?"
   In Egypt, the overwhelming view is that Mr. Hussein's
action has destroyed hopes for Arab unity. And they fear it
will provoke foreign intervention that will cause a lasting
rift in the region.
   On Saturday night in Cairo, a group of senior military
officers drew up a list of winners and losers in the wake of
Iraq's action. Israel topped everyone's list of winners. All
reasoned that the invasion will likely increase U.S. military
aid to Israel and harden Israeli attitudes toward ceding land
to Palestinians.
   Mr. Mubarak tended to turn up on the list of losers. Last
week, he frantically tried to defuse the conflict and even
assured both the Kuwaitis and the West that Iraq wouldn't
invade. Iraq's action humiliated Mr. Mubarak, and the Arab
world's divided response suggests that his leverage as a
regional power broker is waning.
   Egypt also appears to have lost its role as the PLO's
go-between with America and Israel. "Iraq is the PLO's
godfather now," says a senior Jordanian official.
   Both the PLO and Jordan were among those who refused to
join an Arab League vote condemning Iraq. And PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat helped scuttle plans for an Arab summit
yesterday.
   But not everyone is comfortable with the PLO's tilt toward
Baghdad. At a seaside lunch in Tunis just before the
invasion, a PLO official tried to justify the shift, saying,
"The West talks about Saddam's lack of human rights, but what
about human rights in Saudi Arabia? They're abysmal too."
   His wife shook her head in disbelief. "You know very well
Saddam is a butcher," she said. The couple lived in Iraq for
several months until she insisted they leave. "I couldn't
stand the repression," she says.
   Arab acquiescence to Iraq's action also reflects
resentment of Kuwait's vast oil wealth. A Jordanian official
who often went begging to the deposed emir calls Kuwait and
other gulf states, "oil wells with flags." A legislator says
"what they spend in one year on houses, women and cars could
pay off our entire national debt."
   In fact, the Kuwaitis have given quite a bit to Jordan,
including most of $125 million promised this year in aid. But
Jordanian officials say Saudi Arabia has paid much more, and
they feel confident Saddam Hussein will do the same if he
controls Kuwait's oil wealth.
   Palestinian officials, who say Kuwait pays a meager $2
million dollars a month to the PLO, also expect largesse from
Mr. Hussein. There is some concern, though, that support of
Iraq by Jordan and the PLO could spark a backlash against
hundreds of thousands of Jordanians and Palestinians working
in the gulf states.
   Kuwait's gulf neighbors responded to the invasion with
predictable alarm. State-controlled media in some states
failed to even mention the invasion for more than 24 hours
after it occurred. Saudi television showed the deposed
Kuwaiti emir in Saudi Arabia, but noted only that he was
"visiting" the kingdom.
   While some impoverished Egyptians resent the Kuwaiti
tourists who flock to expensive Cairo hotel suites, many have
been enriched by work in the emirate.
   "It's a luxury life there," says Jamaa Abdul-Fadil, who
arrived home in Cairo on his annual vacation just four days
before the invasion. Eight years of work as a legal clerk in
Kuwait has comfortably furnished his apartment and allowed
him to buy a small shop in Cairo.
   By contrast, Egyptian workers' experiences in Iraq often
have been bitter. More than a million Egyptians flocked to
bolster Iraqi manpower during the eight-year gulf war.
"Saddam used us up, and when the war was over he tossed us
aside," says Atif Khalid, who worked in Baghdad as a waiter.
Some Egyptians were beaten and shot at by Iraqis, and others
haven't been able to transfer home their earnings as part of
a campaign to clear the way for Iraqi jobseekers returning
from the front. Many Egyptians also served and died in the
war with Iran and more than 10,000 are believed to still be
prisoners of war.
   Egyptians, deeply religious, also identify with Kuwait's
Islamic character. They are outraged that Iraq has once again
breached the Koranic prohibition against Moslems killing
Moslems, as it did when it attacked Iran in 1980.
   If Iraq's action has forced Arab enmities into the open
and forced countries to choose sides, the fate of its
invasion also is likely to determine the Arab world's winners
and losers. Some analysts think King Hussein may be repeating
the error he made in 1967, when he entered the war against
Israel on the side of the Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel
Nasser. Then, the king mistook bluster for strength and lost
half his kingdom -- the West Bank -- to Israeli occupation.
   A senior Jordanian official, though, says Iraq's ascent
marks a return to a much more potent Arab nationalism after
two decades during which Islamic fundamentalism had become
the dominant ideology. Unlike Mr. Nasser, "who bragged of
missiles and had only tin," the official says, "Saddam has
real force and is willing to use it."
   He also has oil, and by not sharing a border with Israel,
he is safer than Mr. Nasser was from Israeli reprisals. And
Western military action against Iraq is widely viewed in the
Arab world as potentially disastrous, because it would make a
martyr of Mr. Hussein and confirm suspicions that many gulf
states are little more than American protectorates. But the
situation is in such flux that many Arabs fear violence could
erupt from unexpected directions.
   "People are thinking with their hearts, not their brains,"
says Asad Abdul Rahman, a member of the Palestinian National
Council, the Palestinian parliament in exile.
