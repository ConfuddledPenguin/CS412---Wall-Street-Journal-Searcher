   Regarding Henry Grunwald's June 26 editorial-page article,
"A Backward Glance From the Animal-Rights Future": Mr.
Grunwald's is a fictional tale from a future in which the
"animal-rights" people have had their way. In this future
world the self-proclaimed former "masters of the earth"
(humans) have lost their almighty power to look upon the
planet as a banquet set out for them exclusively to use,
abuse, consume, pollute and kill, as they see fit.
   According to Mr. Grunwald, the ability of the human race
to destroy animals and the environment is the basis of human
intelligence. Funny, I always thought human intelligence was
something quite different. To me, the truly intelligent
realize the interconnectedness of all life, respect all life,
consider the possible consequences of their actions, and make
use of a gift given to most of us -- a conscience -- before
acting.

   To destroy the environment is wrong, and we are paying the
price in increasing violent crime, immorality and diseases
such as cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular
dystrophy, diabetes, AIDS, leukemia, lupus, etc., etc. Then
we think we can solve those problems by further destruction
of animals in experiments. True health is not drugs and
technology; true health is exactly what the term implies, and
animal experimentation has no place in it.
   Respect for animals and the environment is the only hope
for a bright future for the human race.

   Mr. Grunwald's article uses off-color remarks about
animal-rights activists. I'm surprised you would print
something that would so obviously offend those of us who
believe that causing pain and suffering to animals is wrong.
Animal rights is a very sensitive issue to those of us
civilized enough to realize that treating animals in an
inhumane manner is simply wrong.
   Finally, I'm surprised Mr. Grunwald actually went to the
time and expense to have his terrier diagnosed (as neurotic);
wouldn't it be easier to just kill it?

   Mr. Grunwald, through humor and satire, makes an excellent
point: Animal-rights activists, in their zealous approach to
protect their "constituency," are losing touch with reality.
   One example of how they have become blind to any sort of
acceptable reasoning is on the issue of scientific
experimentation using animals. Science, by using animals as
experimental subjects, has made much progress toward curing
diseases that kill millions of people every year. There would
be no other way to test such drugs and procedures. And most
of the animals used are mice or other animals that are not
endangered species.
   I would propose to the animal-rightists a market solution:
All those opposed to scientific experimentation on animals
should not purchase any drug or related outcome of this kind
of research. Soon, if animal-rightists were the majority
among us, these drugs or medical procedures would not sell
and investment in research using animals would cease.
   But if the majority were composed of people who believe a
human life is worth much more than the life of a lab animal,
then we would continue to use the results of medical research
using animals -- and, it is hoped, we would be able to cure
diseases that are still killing millions every year.
