   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., the troubled futures
concern, was forced into bankruptcy late Friday by commodity
funds it managed that say Stotler owes them more than $5
million.
   Loans from these funds to cash-strapped Stotler Group were
the subject of fraud charges lodged against the company's
fund management division, Stotler Funds Inc., by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week.

   The CFTC charges were the first indication that customer
funds might have been lost as a result of Stotler Group's
worsening financial crisis over the past several weeks.
Although no individuals were named in the CFTC charges, the
ensuing uproar led Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann to resign last
week from the chairmanship of Stotler Group, and from the
prestigious chairmanship of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   More disciplinary actions against Stotler Group or its
units, and possibly its officers, are expected over the next
few months as details become known surrounding the decline
and fall of what had recently been one of the country's
biggest futures brokerage firms. Futures regulators have said
they may also refer certain aspects of Stotler Group's
collapse to the U.S. attorney for possible criminal
prosecution.
   Mr. Mahlmann has asserted that he knew nothing of the
loans made by the funds and hasn't been involved in the
day-to-day management of Stotler Group for two years.
   As the extent of Stotler Group's financial woes became
apparent in recent weeks, futures industry officials said
privately that it was highly unlikely the company could avoid
being forced into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which shields it
from creditors while giving it a chance to reorganize its
finances.
   The funds petitioning for bankruptcy were Advanced
Portfolio Management Partners Ltd. and Thomson McKinnon
Financial Futures Partners Inc. II. APM Partners holds an
unpaid $1 million demand note from Stotler Group. The Thomson
McKinnon fund owns shares in another fund, Compass Futures
Fund, that effectively lent Stotler Group more than $4
million via the purchase of commercial paper. An individual
who apparently is an investor in the Compass fund, David
Freund, was also included in the bankruptcy petition.
   On July 25 Stotler Group defaulted on $750,000 in
commercial paper payments, including $260,000 due the Compass
fund. At that time the company said it might not be able to
repay $7.6 million in debt payments due within 30 days. The
company's Stotler &amp; Co. futures brokerage unit was forced out
of business earlier last month after failing to meet industry
minimum capital requirements.
   Thomas Egan, Stotler Group president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement released Friday that the company
had talked with representatives of the funds to try and avert
an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. "Our intention
and desire was to avert a filing in bankruptcy by developing
a workable plan to cooperate with and maximize the return to
creditors," he said.
   Now that the company has been pushed into bankruptcy, "it
appears unlikely that any return to shareholders of Stotler
Group will be possible," he said.
