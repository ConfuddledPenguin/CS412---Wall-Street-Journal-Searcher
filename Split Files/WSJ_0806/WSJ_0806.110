   Loral Corp., a New York-based defense contractor, said it
definitively agreed to buy the Ford Aerospace Corp. unit of
Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., for $715 million and the
assumption of some debt.
   Loral and Ford said jointly that the transaction is
subject to final regulatory approval and customary closing
conditions, and that they expect to complete the deal within
three months.

   Loral earlier won a bidding contest for Ford Aerospace. On
Friday, Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz and a Ford spokesman
said the terms of the transaction are basically unchanged
from the bid made late last month. At the time, a person
familiar with the bidding negotiations said the cash part of
Loral's bid was about $811 million. But Mr. Schwartz said
Loral and Ford hadn't disclosed any figures prior to Friday's
announcement.
   Loral said it doesn't plan now to shed any Ford Aerospace
operations or make any major changes.
