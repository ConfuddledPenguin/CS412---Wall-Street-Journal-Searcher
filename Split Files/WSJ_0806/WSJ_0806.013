   MONTEVIDEO -- John Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, said
foreign bankers next week will consider and may approve
Uruguay's request to buy back $1.4 billion of its foreign
debt at its market value.
   The proposal "has been accepted in general terms," Mr.
Reed said. "Now we're discussing the numbers."
