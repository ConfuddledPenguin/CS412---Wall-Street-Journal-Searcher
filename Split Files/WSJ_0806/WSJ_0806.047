   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said anti-dumping
duties ranging from 1.7% to 3.17% should be assessed on
imports of synthetic-fiber sweaters from South Korea.
   Before the duties can be applied, however, the U.S.
International Trade Commission must decide whether the
imports, which totaled $476.1 million last year, have injured
the domestic industry. Affirmative rulings by both agencies
are required in anti-dumping cases.

   The duties would offset the advantage of imports priced
below the cost of production or below the price charged in
South Korea's home market.
   The Commerce Department delayed until Aug. 20 its
determination on what anti-dumping duties should be imposed
on sweater imports from Taiwan. Earlier, the department found
that some Hong Kong sweater manufacturers also have violated
the U.S. Anti-Dumping Act.
   The ITC has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on sweater
imports from all three major Asian suppliers.
   The Commerce Department said the dumping margins on the
imports from South Korea averaged 3.17% on man-made fiber
sweaters -- including jackets, vests, cardigans and pullover
garments -- manufactured by Hanil Synthetic Fiber Industrial
Co. and smaller amounts for sweaters produced by other
companies. These included 1.2% for Chunji Industrial Co.,
1.11% for Shinwon Tongsan, 0.92% for Yurim Co., 0.73% for
Young Woo &amp; Co. and 1.3% for all other South Korean
producers.
