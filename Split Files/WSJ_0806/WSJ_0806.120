   The spread of self-imposed bans on the purchase of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait by industrialized nations threatens to
push petroleum prices still higher unless other OPEC nations
increase production.
   Over the weekend, the 12 nations of the European Community
and Japan voted to embargo imports of oil from the two
countries. The U.S. announced similar action last week.

   If all those countries in fact stand by their decisions,
experts said, the ensuing scramble to find replacement oil
elsewhere would test the world's production capacity and
could temporarily send prices soaring -- possibly as high as
$30 to $35 a barrel, or $5 to $10 a barrel above current
levels.
   Aware of that, some members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries that are well out of range of
Iraqi guns already are taking steps to raise output and fill
at least some of the needs of former Iraq customers. And some
oil ministers who have espoused moderate oil prices are
privately talking about possible emergency moves by OPEC
itself that might slow the price runup that began with Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait last week.
   "The market is hysterical," said a senior member of one
country's OPEC delegation. "A majority of the members don't
want to see prices get out of control."
   But it isn't known just how much these countries can or
will do. If the major oil-consuming nations fully boycott
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude -- or if pipelines and tankers
carrying oil out of those countries are blockaded --
production elsewhere would have to rise as much as 4.5
million barrels a day to fill the gap. That would take just
about all the spare production capacity available to world
oil producers.
   And it is uncertain whether it all would be available.
About two million barrels of it is in the hands of Saudi
Arabia, which during tense periods in the past has increased
production to stabilize oil markets. This time, the kingdom
may not open its oil spigots wider, because doing so might be
interpreted by Iraq as an act of war.
   "We are in a fix," conceded one OPEC official.
   Some people are skeptical that all the big oil-consuming
nations -- particularly France and Japan -- can or will stick
to their promises for long. "It's Don Quixote stuff unless we
get other countries to go along, especially the Japanese,"
said Edward Fried, senior fellow at Brookings Institution in
Washington.
   Also, a blockade of oil leaving Iraq and Kuwait so far
hasn't been imposed. Such an action presumably would involve
U.S. Navy ships stopping tankers leaving Iraqi and Kuwaiti
ports and a cut-off of pipelines that carry the bulk of Iraqi
oil exports across Turkey and Saudi Arabia to the
Mediterranean and Red Seas. It would be risky for Turkey and
Saudi Arabia, probably inviting Iraqi retaliation.
   Still, to the extent that efforts to impede Iraq's oil
sales work, oil supplies could tighten in coming months.
   "If the embargo were successful, it would leave the world
short of oil within three to six months," predicted Lawrence
Goldstein, the executive vice president of Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation. Adds Tom Burns, director of economics
for Chevron Corp.: "We're creating an oil shortage where one
didn't exist."
   Joseph Stanislaw, managing director/Europe for Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, also sees a "real price spike" if
the embargo holds, though he is convinced that others,
particularly Saudi Arabia, eventually would step in and pump
more oil to bring prices back down.
   And even if the embargo is ineffective, most oil analysts
expect prices, already up almost $3 a barrel since Wednesday,
to go higher on fear despite the fact that oil inventories
are at a 10-year high. Only a few weeks ago, West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, had dropped to around
$16 a barrel. In futures trading, this quality crude closed
at $24.49 a barrel Friday, up $1.38 for the day.
   "We will definitely see another runup in crude prices,"
said Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   There are signs that some added supplies may already be
headed to the market. Venezuela can increase production as
much as 600,000 barrels a day and it is understood to have
already started.
   A few other OPEC producers -- chiefly Nigeria, Indonesia,
Libya and the Persian Gulf's United Arab Emirates, though
under threat from Iraq -- are capable of producing more oil.
Most producers outside OPEC are running flat out.
   Eventually, prices are expected to come down again,
perhaps to about $22 a barrel. But they aren't expected to
fall back to the old depressed levels because of the scare
thrown into oil markets. Oil markets have both a "mental
ceiling" and a "mental floor" for petroleum prices, said
Antonio M. Szabo, president of Bonner &amp; Moore Management
Science."The mental ceiling just went up," he said.
   As a result, the carefully crafted oil-production pact
struck by OPEC only 10 days ago that was designed to tighten
supplies and gradually raise prices has been rendered
meaningless. Some experts suggest the existence of OPEC
itself may been threatened.
   Even if OPEC survives, experts say it will never be the
same with two of its most powerful members, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, practically paralyzed by Iraqi military might. Such
an outcome would end an era of a strategy carefully plotted
over the years by the two OPEC heavyweights. They guided OPEC
on a path that assured consumers a moderately priced yet
secure source of oil.
