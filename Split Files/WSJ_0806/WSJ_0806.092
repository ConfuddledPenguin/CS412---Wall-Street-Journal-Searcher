   It is easy to see on a map, in color, that the land
between the Tigris and the Euphrates has what most of the
Middle East lacks -- water. In addition, Iraq's position,
expanse, arable land, and oil might suggest to someone even
other than a compulsive empire-builder like Saddam Hussein
the possibility of making the country the leader of the Arab
nation, as it was in the days of the caliphs. Although the
world has never known an empire that did not require many
generations to create, men like Napoleon, Hitler, Nasser, and
Saddam are willing to race their mortality against the
overwhelming inertia of history and its clearest and most
apparent laws. The rashness born of their impatience always
leads them through a string of bright victories to the
darkest chamber of defeat. In the light of his victories,
Saddam inspires fear and doubt, but he is moving in the
shadow of his undoing.
   Those who urge the United States to reduce its military
capacity because they say the world is safe will now call for
restraint because the world is dangerous. Forgetting that
even under President Carter the United States pledged to
defend the Persian Gulf against even the Russians, even with
nuclear weapons, "pragmatists" will not understand Saddam's
99% discount. Their habitual alternation of nonchalance and
fear will lead them to the conviction that he holds all the
cards. If, uninfluenced by dreams of a world permanently
cleansed of war, one looks clearly at Saddam's hand, one can
see that he actually holds very few.

   His is a country of 17 million people arrayed against the
many hundreds of millions in the countries he antagonizes, of
a GDP of $40 billion as opposed to the nearly $15 trillion of
NATO and Japan. He is surrounded by enemies, unfriendly
allies, seas he cannot control, and desert that would eat his
columns as readily as it would soak up water. Although he is
cheered on by Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Yasser Arafat, and King
Hussein, this only means that his friends are either insane,
impertinent, or afraid, which guarantees him very little in a
pinch. The Iraqi population is three-quarters urban, and
therefore vulnerable to the kind of civil and industrial
disruption to which Vietnam, for example, was not.
   The list of development projects and foreign contractors
in Iraq is almost as long as that detailing the Iraqi debt.
Without foreign activity and foreign trade, which accounts
for a third of its gross domestic product, Iraq stops short,
and so do Saddam's megalomaniacal ambitions. Not only is he
dependent upon the industrialized world for his major
weaponry, his primary income, and the necessities of his
economy, but his oil facilities, dams, and precious few
routes of communication are eminently bombable, burstable,
and blockadable.
   Iraq is like an island in the desert. It can be virtually
shut down by dealing with a very short list of targets: the
multiple pipelines and associated pumping stations that
convey oil to the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Persian
Gulf; the half a dozen major roads leading out, and a like
number of international railroads and internal feeder lines,
all with reference to bridges and viaducts; hydroelectric and
flood control dams; aqueducts; and ports, which need not be
destroyed but only blocked, either close-in with mines, or at
more remote choke points and straits.
   Further to his disadvantage, Saddam's timing is no more
precise than Hitler's military astrology. The American and
allied response is now favored not only by the fundamental
measures of power but by an extraordinary coalition of
historical coincidences. In threatening the world's oil
supply, Saddam reduces the equation of national interests to
its prime factors and stimulates every industrialized nation
to militate against him. Just a few years ago, the Soviet
Union would have been the threat behind Saddam, as China was
with Vietnam, protecting it from unrestrained American
action. Now the Soviets are more like a threat with which
Saddam must contend, and from which, he recently has been
told, most of his arms and spare parts will no longer
continue to flow. The Soviets will probably be delighted to
demonstrate the new world order that they proclaim -- and
upon which their domestic tranquility curiously depends -- by
close cooperation with the western powers during this crisis.
   While oil prices are rising, Iran may see a temporary
advantage in acquiescence to the occupation of Kuwait, but as
soon as Iraq is properly overextended Iran will be tempted to
attack it, and no one knows this better than Saddam Hussein.
Although the radical Arabs and leftist fronts in the Arab
world will hope for a complete conquest of the Gulf, the real
powers -- Egypt, Syria, and the Gulf States themselves --
will accommodate the enemies of Iraq even while piously
invoking non-existent Arab solidarity.
   If it is all so easy, then why is it so difficult? If the
broad correlation of forces runs overwhelmingly against
Saddam, how can he move with impunity? He just acts
naturally. In this instance he intimidates the world by
holding Saudi Arabia hostage, using the threat of invasion to
discourage a proper reaction to the subjugation of Kuwait.
More specifically, he hopes that by threatening the Saudis he
will deter a blockade of Iraq and enjoy his recent conquests
free of charge.
   If Iraq's original intent were to strike Saudi Arabia, it
would have no reason to have paused in Kuwait and alerted the
whole world. Kuwait is neither the seat of military
opportunity nor a point of requisite consolidation. But, like
Nasser after he surpassed his own expectations in blockading
the Straits of Tiran, Saddam may be sufficiently emboldened
by success to follow his options as they are created. Still,
if he does strike south, either now or next time, the game is
not over.
   His vaunted army is fit mainly for attacking fat and
defenseless sheiks or fighting the most primitive war of
attrition. The army began the conflict with Iran knowing
little other than the worn Soviet doctrine of static defense,
and exited a world leader in mowing down waves of suicidal
Iranian teen-agers. The Iraqi air force is fairly impressive
on paper but nearly somnolent in the air. Iraqi conscripts
are sick of war, and their generals have never had to fight
at a distance even halfway that of the potential Saudi
objectives. Their lines of communication, in flat treeless
terrain, would become a shooting gallery for the United
States once it took control of the skies, something that is
entirely possible if the Saudis will finally summon the grit
necessary to defend themselves other than by jumping in bed
with their tormenters. Absent Saudi conversion, little can be
done, but, with everything to lose, the Saudis may now summon
enough backbone to allow someone else to fight their battles
for them. If they don't, they are finished by their own
invitation.
   Several American and European air wings, staging through
Egypt, could settle on the assiduously prepared Saudi bases
and, in conjunction with half a dozen aircraft carriers in
the Arabian Sea and the eastern Mediterranean, B-52s from
Diego Garcia, and cruise missiles from almost anywhere, make
an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia the wrong decision. With
Iran, Syria, and, in limited fashion, Israel ready to move on
Iraq if the best of its forces tarry in the desert, the
Iraqis must hold back an enormous reserve. The "million-man
army" of television lore would be reduced in Saudi Arabia to
an expeditionary force that could be cut off, pieced apart,
and destroyed by NATO air power and light forces. Nor are
Western rapid deployment forces the only timely response. No
strangers to fighting in the Arabian Peninsula, the Egyptians
could ferry well equipped armored divisions across the narrow
Straits of Tiran to a paved Saudi road directly opposite, or
transit small sections of Israel and Jordan even faster.
   A hundred ways exist to apply huge reserves of military
and economic power, vastly superior to that of the Iraqis, to
deter an Iraqi invasion or dislodge Iraqi invaders. It is
simply a matter of will, and in this the Saudis above all
should heed the lesson of Rukn al-Din, an Ismaili chieftain
who failed to stem the Mongol conquest, because he could not
summon enough faith in his impressive power to resist. At the
Battle of 'Ain Jalut the Mongols were finally stopped by the
Egyptian Mamluk Baybars, who had formed a temporary allience
with the Crusaders. It wasn't that Baybars was so strong, it
was that the Mongols had overextended themselves.
   Saddam Hussein wants us to believe that if we dare defend
our interests, if we blockade Iraq until Kuwait is free, he
will move on Saudi Arabia. But we can defend Saudi Arabia,
or, if necessary, retake it. By all means the United States
and its allies should enlist the cooperation of the Saudis,
make meticulous preparations for their defense, and call
Saddam's bluff.
