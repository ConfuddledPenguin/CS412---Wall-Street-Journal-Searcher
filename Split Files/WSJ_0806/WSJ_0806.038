   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Perini Investment Properties Inc.
said it suspended its dividend and announced a decline in
second-quarter cash flow to three cents a share from 23 cents
in the year-ago period.
   The real-estate investment trust blamed the decline on a
drop in distributions from joint ventures, which it called
"largely a timing item," increased interest payments in the
quarter and a decline in cash flow from certain operating
properties.

   The company said it expects these conditions to affect
operating cash flow for the remainder of the year. But it
said that certain planned transactions "could significantly
improve" results.
   In a statement, the company said it elected to suspend the
dividend in keeping with the board's policy of paying out 50%
to 60% of current cash flow. But the statement said the board
reaffirmed its belief that the net current per-share value of
the company's assets is "substantially in excess" of the
current share price.
