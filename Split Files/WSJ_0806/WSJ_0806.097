   Mesa Limited Partnership, Dallas, citing disappointing
prices for natural gas, said its net loss widened in the
second quarter to $50 million, or 49 cents a unit, from $13.4
million, or one cent a unit, a year earlier.
   T. Boone Pickens, the company's general partner, said Mesa
expects a 1990 average gas price of $1.60 per 1,000 cubic
feet this year. In the latest quarter, prices fell to $1.39
per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.56 a year earlier.

million in gains from similar transactions.
   For the first half, Mesa reported a net loss of $68.2
million, or 79 cents a unit, on revenue of $158.8 million,
against profit of $1.2 million, or 14 cents a unit, on
