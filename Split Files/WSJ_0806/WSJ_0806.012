   BOSTON -- In Massachusetts, where everybody talks about
the weather, restaurant owners want to do something about it
-- the talk that is.
   They want Boston TV weather forecasters to stop predicting
on Monday and Tuesday bad weather for the weekend ahead.

   "I understand their side. There is a demand for it," says
Thomas Larson, owner of the Pillar House Restaurant in Newton
and chairman of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association
Weather Task Force. "But if the {long-range} forecast doesn't
look so good, hey, keep it a secret because it's so harmful
to business."
   To that end, the association has solicited complaints and
forwarded packets of its members' letters to the weathermen.
   Mr. Larson says the problem is that long-range forecasts
aren't very accurate. He doesn't object to three-day
forecasts, which he concedes are usually right.
   Restaurateurs are bitter about predictions that keep
tourists away from Cape Cod or the Berkshires. "Before
Memorial Day weekend, weathermen forecast terrible weather on
the Cape," recalls Cindy Eid, public-affairs coordinator for
the Massachusetts Restaurant Association. "They told people
if they wanted a peek of sun to head north. But it turned out
to be one of the best weekends of the summer."
   Frank Cardullo, owner of the Wursthaus Restaurant, says
his Hyannis branch suffered $75,000 in lost revenue last
summer on good weekends after rain had been predicted.
   Other restaurant owners say winter-storm warnings are even
worse.
   M.S.M. Management Co., Danvers, says that two years ago
inaccurate predictions of a big storm for Feb. 24 cost its
restaurants $100,000 in lost revenue. That same weekend, the
Harvard Club of Boston says, "the irresponsibility of the
weather forecasters" led to the cancellation of a dinner
party for 250.
   Some weathermen are sympathetic. Dick Albert, of WCVB-TV
in Boston, says the letters have sensitized him to the
problem, but he adds that he has avoided five-day forecasts
for many years.
   But most stations say it's more important to give the
public what it wants. "Whenever we don't have time to do it,
the public complains," says Barry Burbank, of WBZ-TV. He says
he makes it clear that the long-range view is less reliable
than the short-range picture: "We don't call it a forecast.
We call it an outlook," he says.
