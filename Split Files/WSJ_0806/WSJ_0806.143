   Gasoline prices have shot up as much as 15 cents a gallon
in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and are likely to go
higher despite outcries from motorists, politicians and
consumer groups.
   Only hours after news of the hostilities broke, prices
were being raised all along America's gasoline supply chain,
from refineries to the corner service station. "I've never
seen it happen so quickly," said Bill Dodd, a harried staff
member at the Florida branch of the American Automobile
Association in Orlando. Pump prices in that state jumped two
to 15 cents on Friday and "indications are they are going up
higher," he said. "As we're speaking, the price is going up."

   In Michigan, one-third of all service stations had raised
pump prices five cents to 10 cents a gallon by Friday and
most others expected to have prices up by today, according to
a national AAA survey. Massachusetts motorists were already
paying six cents more Friday. In California, major refiners
such as Atlantic Richfield Co. and Chevron Corp. had boosted
prices they charge to dealers by four or five cents a gallon.
   Nationally, the AAA said, the average price of
self-service unleaded had zoomed up by four cents to $1.115 a
gallon by Friday morning. At some of the 1,400 stations
checked, the boost was as big as 15 cents. The AAA said the
price increases were just the beginning, too, because some
big wholesale price increases still remained to be passed on
to consumers. "We're calling for restraint," said a spokesman
for the national association.
   Others are screaming.
   "We can't win," said Edwin Rothschild, energy policy
director of the Washington consumer-advocate group Citizen
Action. "Falling crude led to higher gasoline prices earlier
this year. Now we have higher crude prices and gasoline
prices go up again."
   "I've been getting tons of phone calls from members who
believe the oil companies are profiteering and taking
advantage of a bad situation," said Mr. Dodd of the Florida
AAA.
   At least one politician, Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D.,
Conn.), demanded establishment of a government task force to
"monitor the oil industry" and look for "signs of panic or
profit taking that may be harming consumers." He echoed the
widespread consumer complaint that oil companies raise
gasoline prices quickly when crude prices go up but seem
forgetful when crude falls.
   The latest boosts are certainly pulling a lot of money
from the pockets of motorists, and quickly. A
five-cent-a-gallon increase translates into an extra $16.3
million a day nationally. If that increase lasts for a year,
it adds up to about $5.9 billion that consumers won't have
available to spend elsewhere.
   Public irritation over the speedy price increases could
cause unexpected results. Most troublesome is the possibility
that the fear and furor -- all by itself -- could fuel
further price increases and possibly even create lines at
service stations.
   Gasoline demand may jump sharply and stay unusually high
in coming weeks simply because motorists, trying to beat the
next price rise or worried about shortages, may insist on
filling up their tanks and keeping them full. Normally, they
might drive around on half a tank most of the time.
   "If you put another quarter of a tank {of gasoline} in
every car in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, it makes a
huge difference," said Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York. That sudden added demand was as
much a cause of service station lines during the Iranian
crisis in 1979 as was the actual cutoff of crude oil, he
maintained.
   In fact, with far fewer gas stations in the U.S. today, he
said the chance of gas lines are even greater now. "In the
old days, you had four or five stations in the neighborhood
and now you have two," Mr. Jacoboski said. Once started, "it
snowballs," he said. "The guy in the office says, `You should
have seen the line at the local Shell station,'" and everyone
rushes to fill up.
   Oil companies, smarting from public charges of price
gouging and profiteering once again, denied that was the
case. But when asked to explain the pricing process, some
declined. An Exxon Corp. spokesman said company officials
wouldn't comment. "The situation is moving so fast," he said,
adding: "They're observing the marketplace." Amoco Corp.
officials also declined to comment.
   "It's a public relations nightmare," said a marketing
executive for a major oil company, who sought anonymity. "The
oil industry has not had an outstanding reputation, and it's
the only business where you have to post your prices with
15-foot-high signs."
   Others, however, did try to explain the immediate rise in
gasoline prices. The reason, many said, is that gasoline --
like crude oil or gold or soybeans -- is a traded commodity
and acts like one, with prices moving in a free market,
sometimes exaggerated and hastened by commodity futures
trading. The production cost at the time the gasoline was
made doesn't control such trading.
   Right now, "there is fear and panic in the marketplace,"
said an Arco spokesman. "Because of that, you're seeing an
irrational response" through the entire distribution system
that includes the oil companies, middlemen known as jobbers
and the stations themselves.
   As the market price moved, sellers tried to stay in line.
Arco, the spokesman said, raised prices in a defensive
response to boosts by other oil companies. "If the difference
between our gasoline and our competitors' is five to 15
cents, we'd have a run on our supply" all the way from the
gasoline pumps to Arco's wholesale distribution network, he
said.
   That explanation is echoed by a spokesman for Coastal
Corp., a big refiner, wholesaler and retailer based in
Houston. "We didn't initiate any price increases. We follow
the market," he said, referring to the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Gasoline futures prices rose more than four cents a
gallon in trading on the Merc on Friday, settling at 72.18
cents. The price had ranged as high as 78.5 cents during the
day.
   The Coastal spokesman said the company raised prices to
protect its regular customers. "We had to go to the price
increases to allocate supply," he said. "If you become the
low-price supplier, nonregular customers start buying."
   Coastal raised wholesale prices to 6,000 regular customers
by seven to eight cents a gallon Thursday. It then bumped
prices up eight to nine cents more on Friday, but later that
same day it dropped back a nickel because it was out of line
with the market in the other direction, the spokesman said.
   The same forces that caused refiners and wholesalers to
raise prices applies at the corner station. Marty Bush, owner
of a Texaco station in Beaumont, Texas, and president of the
Lone Star Service Stations Association, says he believes
several nearby stations boosted their prices even though
their costs hadn't gone up. He disapproves and refused to do
so himself Friday. "People get upset with you," he said.
   Mike Grivon, owner of a Houston Shell station, said Friday
he hadn't raised prices either because he had received a
delivery just under the wire at old prices. "I got a load of
gas last night, {one hour} before midnight," when a boost
went into effect. "If I'd gotten it later I would have been
up three cents a gallon." With prices several cents lower
than nearby stations the next morning, Mr. Grivon said, cars
were stacked up four deep at his pumps.
   But Rita Johnson, manager of a Chevron station about a
mile away, didn't get that break. She raised prices a nickel
early Friday because the price she paid went up that much. "I
received a call late {Thursday} evening from California
stating that my cost for the gas I received this morning
would be five cents a gallon more," she said. She gets no
slack in paying. When 9,000 gallons is delivered, she said,
"I give the driver the check."
   So "the consumer bites the bullet," she conceded.
   The gasoline she received came from a Chevron terminal in
nearby Galena Park, said Bruce Frolich, Chevron vice
president of supply and distribution. It was probably made at
the company's Port Arthur refinery about 100 miles away, he
said, from crudes produced in Texas, West Africa, the North
Sea or Mexico. The trip from the refinery to Ms. Johnson's
pumps probably took at least 30 days.
   The decision to raise prices was made in company
headquarters, in San Francisco. "We just decided that the
market {was} a nickel above where we were," said James
Huccaby, manager of pricing and supply. "This thing really
took off."
