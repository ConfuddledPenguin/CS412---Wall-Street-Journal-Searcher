   TOKYO -- Volatile world oil prices ensure that interest
rates will increase in Japan, a country haunted by memories
of torrid inflation during the oil crises of the 1970s. Some
analysts fear that tighter credit will inhibit Japanese
buying at this week's big U.S. Treasury refunding auctions.
   To ward off the inflationary effects of higher oil prices,
economists say, the Bank of Japan is likely to boost its
discount rate, which it charges on loans to financial
institutions. Most economists expect the increase to come as
early as this week, in light of the jump in world oil prices
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.

   "This is the last nail in the coffin of the current
interest-rate structure," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an
economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. here. Added another
analyst at a U.S. securities firm: "This is probably just the
excuse {Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi} Mieno has been
looking for."
   If rates in Japan rise, economists worry that the
country's big institutional investors, who normally are major
buyers at U.S. Treasury auctions, may decide to keep their
money at home, where it will earn more in interest and won't
be exposed to foreign-exchange market gyrations.
   Even before the invasion, Japan's financial markets were
warily anticipating tighter credit. Last week, commercial
banks effectively raised their prime lending rates, and
government bond yields crept higher.
   Then came the Iraqi invasion. The ensuing volatility in
oil's price whipsawed Japan's already-jittery markets. On
Friday, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 729.42
points to 29515.76, its first time below the 30000 mark in
more than three months. The No. 119 10-year government bond
dropped 0.54 to 84.76 to yield 7.15%, up 0.1 percentage
point.
   Late Sunday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu overrode the
opposition of the powerful Ministry of International Trade
and Industry to join ranks with the U.S. and the European
Community in imposing an international trade embargo against
Iraq.
   By joining the trade embargo, Japan risks 700 billion yen
($4.67 billion) of commercial and other loans outstanding to
Baghdad, but the overall economic effects would hardly be
crippling. Unlike the two previous oil crises, the country
wouldn't face a shortage of supply by cutting off Iraq, even
if it also loses supplies from occupied Kuwait. In the first
six months of the year, Japan imported about 220,000 barrels
a day from each country, or a total of about 12% of its oil
imports. Although Japan imports 99% of its oil, 70% of it
from the Middle East, the country has a strategic reserve
that could supply the nation at full capacity for nearly five
months.
   In the 1973 oil crisis, a sudden embargo on oil by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries resulted in a
quadrupling of world oil prices and severe inflation in
Japan. At the time, Japan was importing five million barrels
a day, and the cost of crude was the equivalent of almost 5%
of gross national product. In 1979, when oil prices suddenly
doubled, oil dependency was only marginally less.
   Today, however, although Japan still consumes one in 10
barrels of the world's oil, its oil bill accounts for less
than 1% of GNP, about the same as in the U.S. and less than
other industrialized countries, including West Germany. Its
dependence on oil for energy has dropped to 58% in 1989 from
78% in 1973. Even a long-term increase in crude prices to $21
a barrel, about $5 more than prices a month ago, would raise
consumer prices in Japan only about 0.08 percentage point,
according to Nomura Research Institute, an arm of Nomura
Securities Co.
   Some analysts argue that a higher import bill could
benefit Japan by trimming its persistent trade surpluses and
cooling industrial expansion. UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew
International Ltd. predicted that a $5-a-barrel increase in
oil prices would shave Japan's trade surplus by 10% a year.
   The risk to Japan's economy, analysts say, really lies in
the credit policy of the Bank of Japan. Mr. Mieno is known
for his anxiety about repeating the mistakes that allowed
inflation to rage at 25% after the first oil crisis in 1973.
   It would be the fifth official tightening of credit since
May 1989, when the discount rate stood at a historic low of
2.5%. The rate now is 5.25%.
   In Japan, higher rates would tend to damp consumer
spending and capital investment by big companies. But
economists say the economy appears healthy enough to
withstand another rate rise.
   The greater threat of higher Japanese rates may lie
abroad. As rates on Japanese government bonds trend higher,
rates in the U.S., where the economy is showing signs of
slowing fast, are likely to weaken, making U.S. bonds look
less attractive to big Japanese investors, economists say.
   That could create problems for the U.S. Treasury, which
plans to try to raise $32.25 billion this week at auctions
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. If Japanese investors, who
normally take up about a third of the total, aren't
aggressive bidders, interest rates in the U.S. may creep up.
"What will determine the auction is exchange rates," said
Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research
Institute. He believes that if the dollar is strong against
the yen, investors will steer clear of dollar-denominated
investments such as U.S. Treasurys out of a long-term view
that the currency will weaken.
