   How to speed up product development is the primary concern
of nearly every senior executive of every major industrial
corporation. We can learn a lot from those who lead in their
ability to speed new products to the market without
sacrificing product quality or marketability. My own top-10
list would be:
   Honda, Compaq, Motorola, Sony, Canon, Boeing, Merck
pharmaceuticals, Microsoft, Intel microprocessors and Toyota.
There are others I could have chosen. 3M comes to mind. So
does Ford, lately. Nonetheless, I believe my picks are the
best.

   The following management themes are common to most, if not
all of these suppliers:
   -- They focus on one or only a few businesses. They are
not diversified conglomerates. The senior management of the
company is able to direct its attention to the business at
hand. Typically more than 80% of the sales at these companies
come from one or two highly related businesses. Merck is the
second most focused major pharmaceutical company in the world
with 84% of its sales coming from pharmaceutical products.
Canon's optical based products account for 88% of sales.
Boeing gets 89% of its sales from aircraft. Automobiles
account for 84% of Toyota's sales.
   Intel and Honda produce many different products, but they
both have an underlying technology that drives them. All of
Honda's sales come from engine-based products (e.g. autos,
motorcycles, lawn mowers). All of Intel's sales come from the
design, development, manufacture and sale of microcomputer
components and related products (at various levels of
integration).
   Compaq focuses almost solely on the personal computer
market, and more specifically, on the business PC market.
Michael Swavely, president of Compaq's North American
Division commented: "We don't spend a lot of time worrying
about the home market or the educational market or some of
the industrial markets. We focus our resources on developing
new products to meet the needs of the business PC user."
   -- They are global. Two points are worth making here.
First, their capability is so strong that they are able to
compete globally. Second, many actively pursue international
markets specifically where the competition is stiff to ensure
that they remain world class by being tested against the
best.
   In fact, world-class developers usually are among the top
ten competitors in each of the major global markets -- U.S.,
Japan and Europe. Boeing holds a bigger share than Airbus or
McDonnell Douglas in each of the three markets. Merck is
first in the U.S., sixth in Europe and ninth in Japan. Toyota
is first in Japan, fifth in the U.S. and would be higher than
its twelfth position in Europe were it not for protectionist
policies. The same holds true for Honda which is third in
Japan and fourth in the U.S. Compaq is the second supplier of
business PCs in the U.S. and Canada, and second in Europe
too.
   Motorola spares no effort to break into tough markets.
Motorola pressured the Japanese to open up its
telecommunication market and has become a significant player
in the cellular market. In 1988, Canon initiated a five-year
Global Corporation Plan intended to increase production
world-wide by relocating some of its manufacturing
capabilities, and extending R&amp;D outside of Japan. Merck is
the most aggressive of all large pharmaceutical companies in
obtaining approvals for and marketing its new drugs in the
top world markets. Between 1982 and 1988 Merck launched 10
new drugs in 47% of the top 12 markets world-wide against an
industry median of 33%.
   Typically world-class developers have 35% to 70% of their
sales outside their home market. Merck led all U.S. drug
companies in 1988 with 50% of its sales outside the U.S.
Honda had 63% of its sales outside Japan, while both Canon
and Sony had 69%. Motorola had 36% outside of the U.S. and
Intel had 43%. In 1989, international sales accounted for 45%
of Compaq's revenue, 46% of 3M's and 55% of Microsoft's.
Perhaps reflecting the increasing importance of global
markets, Ford's new chief executive, Red Poling, has seven
years of experience with Ford of Europe.
   -- Senior management is actively involved in defining and
improving the product development process. At Merck there are
numerous senior management committees that meet on a monthly
basis to manage the development process and the portfolio of
candidates in the pipeline. At Microsoft, Bill Gates keeps in
contact with its engineers by dispatching memos over the
company's electronic mail network, sometimes as many as 30 in
a day. Many CEOs were themselves involved in the product
development process. Roy Vagelos of Merck is a physician and
a biochemist. He became research chief in 1976. Honda has had
a tradition of engineering executives. All four presidents in
Honda's history have been engineers and had previously led
the R&amp;D organization.
   -- They have the ability to recruit and retain the top
people in their fields. One of Merck managers' more important
responsibilities is to recruit stars. Consequently, Merck
boasts that its people are higher quality than found at some
of the best academic institutions. In order to retain the
talent, Merck is known to skip several rungs on the ladder
when promoting its top people. Microsoft, too, is known for
hiring the best and brightest possible.
   -- They understand that speed to market reinforces product
quality, rather than threatening it. If Honda and GM are both
designing an auto for the 1992 market, and it takes Honda two
years to design the model while GM takes five, Honda has a
number of advantages. It can design in 1990 available
technology, whereas GM must design in 1987 technology. Honda
need only forecast customer need two years into the future,
whereas GM requires a five-year time horizon, and is much
more likely to miss. Finally, Honda's development teams gain
development experience 2.5 times more quickly than GM's.
   World-class product development requires senior management
leadership, involvement and commitment. It requires a
disciplined new-product development process recognized and
understood by all who "touch" it in the organization. It also
requires aggressive goals to ensure continuous improvement.
