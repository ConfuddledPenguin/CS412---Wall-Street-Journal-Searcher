   WASHINGTON -- The White House nominated Richard Roberts to
the Securities and Exchange Commission in a bid to add a
conservative Democrat to a panel already stacked with
champions of free-market theory.
   The selection of Mr. Roberts, a former top staffer for
Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), raised questions on Capitol
Hill about whether the Bush administration was thanking Sen.
Shelby for his vote to confirm Timothy Ryan as the nation's
top savings-and-loan regulator four months ago.

   During that confirmation process, Mr. Ryan's limited S&amp;L
background brought a barrage of tough questions from
Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee -- including some
from Sen. Shelby. Things looked so bleak that in an unusual
statement before the full Senate, committee Chairman Donald
Riegle (D., Mich.) said that Mr. Ryan's approval appeared
unlikely. But Sen. Shelby, acknowledging that he had
"vacillated" on the decision, surprised the panel by
providing the swing vote in an 11-10 victory for Mr. Ryan.
   Mr. Roberts, 39 years old, said in an interview that he
knew nothing about the White House's motives for his
nomination, and contended that "basically, I intend to be a
prudent regulator." Sen. Shelby couldn't be reached for
comment over the weekend.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Roberts will fill one of
the commission's two Democratic seats and would succeed
Joseph Grundfest, a free-market Democrat who left the
commission in January. Mr. Roberts wasn't a hand-picked
choice of Chairman Richard Breeden, agency officials said,
though Mr. Breeden apparently had veto power over the
selection, which he obviously opted not to exercise.
   Mr. Roberts said that he expects to bring legislative
expertise to the panel, which currently comprises securities
lawyer Edward Fleischman, former Time Inc. counsel Philip
Lochner Jr., former futures-industry attorney Mary Schapiro
and Mr. Breeden, a securities and banking lawyer. Mr. Roberts
is also a lawyer.
   The nominee's legislative background could help the
commission in situations where it wants Capitol Hill
assistance, Mr. Roberts said. For example, he said he would
like to see the commission work with Congress to cobble
together a definition of insider trading -- an area in which
a recent appeals court ruling may force the agency to rethink
which cases it brings. Prior efforts to create such a
definition have encountered heavy resistance on Capitol Hill.
   Mr. Roberts also said he plans to help the commission
press its recently stepped-up enforcement effort. "I think
the commission has a strong tradition in the enforcement
area," he said. "I'd be interested in joining them to push
these very important basic investor safeguards."
   In other areas, Mr. Roberts said he hopes to help the
commission "strengthen investor confidence in our securities
markets." He said he favors "circuit breakers," which set
artificial stopping points to allow the markets to take
breathers during sharp price moves. But he added that he
wouldn't back a ban of program trading because "I don't think
you can take people's computers away from them."
   He also said he generally agrees with Sen. Shelby's view
on corporate governance and takeover issues. In the past,
Sen. Shelby has supported confidential voting in proxy
fights, forcing shareholder votes on whether a company may
adopt a "poison pill" takeover defense and forcing
shareholder votes on "golden parachutes," in which managers
get large cash payouts in the event of a takeover.
   Mr. Roberts, a native of Birmingham, Ala., also worked for
Sen. Shelby in the House, where the congressman was a member
of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the SEC.
When Sen. Shelby was elected to the Senate, Mr. Roberts moved
with him as his administrative assistant. In April, Mr.
Roberts left the senator's staff to join the Washington
office of the Alabama law firm of Miller, Hamilton, Snider &amp;
Odom.
