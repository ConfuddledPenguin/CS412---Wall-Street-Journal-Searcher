   LOS ANGELES -- The South Coast Air Quality Management
District approved the proposed merger between Southern
California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.,
thereby removing a major obstacle to the combination of the
two utilities.
   Southern California Edison is a unit of SCEcorp. Rosemead,
Calif. The merger was approved by SCEcorp. and San Diego Gas
&amp; Electric shareholders in April 1989. The $2.56 billion
transaction is still awaiting approvals by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the California Public Utilities
Commission. In June, the Justice Department said it wouldn't
oppose the proposed merger.

   Environmentalists have opposed the merger, charging that
it would worsen air pollution in the Southern California
area. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is the
air pollution control regulation agency for Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. The district,
which has the worst air quality of any metropolitan region in
the U.S., has begun a plan to clean up the air to comply with
federal clean-air standards.
   The Air Quality Management District's approval of the
merger requires Southern California Edison to more than
offset pollution increases in the South Coast Air Basin. To
accomplish this, the utility would underwrite the costs for
other polluters to switch from internal combustion engines to
electrical motors to run their equipment.
   As part of the proposed merger, Southern California Edison
would shift generation of electricity from older San Diego
power plants to more efficient Edison plants in the South
Coast Air Basin. Environmentalists and others had charged
that this shift would interfere with plans to clean up the
South Coast Air Basin's polluted air.
