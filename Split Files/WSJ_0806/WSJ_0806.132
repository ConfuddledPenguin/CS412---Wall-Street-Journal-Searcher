   LONDON -- Barclays PLC posted sickly earnings Friday, a
day after Midland Bank PLC announced "unacceptable results"
and wholesale job cuts.
   While both banks were expected to show poor results, both
did worse than expected. The British economy -- sapped by
high inflation and sluggish growth -- is the main culprit.
Corporations here, particularly small and middle-sized ones,
are under financial stress. Both Midland and Barclays have
sharply increased their provisions for bad corporate debts.

   Barclays reported a half-year pretax profit of #602
million ($1.1 billion), up 2% from #590 million the year
before. But its return on average total assets slumped to
0.9% from 1.0% in 1989.
   Meanwhile, the bank said it plans to sell its mercantile
credit operation in the United Kingdom. Midland is also
selling a subsidiary, its finance house, Forward Trust Group
Ltd.
   Overall, Midland's picture is bleaker. Alan Broughton, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., remarked, "Midland's
figures were disastrous; Barclays' figures were
disappointing."
   Midland, which posted an anemic half-year pretax profit of
#36 million, plans to cut about 4,000 employees by the end of
1991, a reflection of the strains.
   Midland is selling Forward Trust to bolster its capital
base, whereas Barclays is disposing of its mercantile credit
operation for strategic reasons: It duplicates services
offered by Barclays' retail banking unit. In addition to #234
million of bad-loan provisions for the U.K. portfolio,
Midland is saddled with an overhang of Third World debt and
big trading losses from 1989.
   More recently, though, it is Britain's economic woes that
are hammering away at the banking industry's profits. "In
every case the banks reported worse results than the analysts
were looking for," said Rodney Schwartz, banking analyst with
Lehman Brothers International Inc. in London. He reasons that
the British economy is worse than the analysts had assumed.
   Barclays' U.K. banking and treasury operations showed a
first-half profit of #275 million, down from #519 million in
1989. The bank took a #290 million charge for bad and
doubtful debts, an increase of #244 million from last year.
Analysts expect the banking industry's problems to persist.
"We're still in an environment of high interest rates and
high inflation," said Morgan Stanley's Mr. Broughton. "The
number of insolvencies is increasing."
