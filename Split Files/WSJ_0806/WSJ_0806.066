   In an unusual arrangement similar to the appointment of a
bankruptcy-court trustee, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
turned over control of its asset liquidation to a
court-appointed outsider.
   The move puts George D. Gould, a former U.S. Treasury
undersecretary, in charge of selling off and reinvesting the
assets of Drexel and its subsidiaries. Mr. Gould, 62 years
old, is now vice chairman of Klingenstein, Fields &amp; Co., a
New York money-management firm, and will not relinquish that
post.

   Drexel filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in February and began liquidating its assets.
   The appointment of Mr. Gould stems from a dispute over
whether the creditors should be privy to Drexel's liquidation
plans. Although the company and the creditors had earlier
operated under an oversight procedure that gave creditors
notice of the transactions, Drexel backed out of that
arrangement in late May -- spurring the creditors to begin
legal action demanding a role in reviewing the liquidation
transactions.
   The new arrangement, negotiated under the supervision of
federal bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III, goes far beyond
the earlier review process. While previously Drexel decided
on the transactions -- after conferring with creditors -- now
Mr. Gould will decide. He will serve as the chairman and only
voting member of a court-appointed investment committee. The
other members of the committee will be one representative
each of Drexel, the parent's creditors' committee and the
creditors' committee of Drexel's brokerage unit.
   "This provides an unprecedented degree of intervention by
an outsider in a bankruptcy proceeding," said Wilbur Ross of
Rothschild Inc., financial adviser to the parent's
creditors'committee. "It's a more elaborate process than we
had before. It is more powerful than what we had."
   Mr. Ross said the arrangement will speed up efforts to
work out a reorganization plan for Drexel because it
eliminates the likelihood of court battles between the debtor
and creditors over the asset liquidation.
   A Drexel spokesman said, "We view this as a workable
solution in our effort to maximize the value of our assets."
   Mr. Gould, well known to players on both sides of the
case, said his appointment is "an attempt to come up with a
referee. . . . My employer, if you will, is the court. I must
be fair to both the creditors and Drexel."
   Under the new plan, Drexel management will recommend
securities transactions to Mr. Gould. He will make decisions
after consulting with the committee. Any member can appeal
Mr. Gould's decision to Judge Buschman. The arrangement also
requires Drexel to provide a regular update of its securities
transactions and the value of its assets to the creditors'
financial advisers. The review process will continue at least
until early November, when a Drexel reorganization plan is
expected to be proposed.
   Mr. Gould will be paid $37,500 a month. Mr. Ross said Mr.
Gould was selected from a list of more than 30 candidates. He
served as Treasury Department undersecretary for domestic
affairs under President Reagan, dealing mainly with finance
and banking issues.

   AN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS doesn't have to be perfect,
appeals court rules.
   The Federal Aviation Administration's analysis of the
environmental impacts of the new Denver airport, now under
construction, wasn't fatally flawed by the use of
inappropriate noise standards, the District of Columbia U.S.
Court of Appeals ruled.
   A group of residents who live north of the airport
contended that the FAA had inadequately addressed their
concerns that noise from airplanes using the airport would
harm waterfowl and other wildlife at the Barr Lake State
Park, northeast of the airport site. The judges agreed that
the FAA had used noise standards with no relevance to the
wildlife refuge. Nevertheless, they ruled, the FAA's
conclusion that the new airport wouldn't substantially
increase the noise levels could have been reached using other
data included in the environmental impact statement.
   Attorneys for the city and county of Denver said the
decision removes the last legal roadblock to the $2.3 billion
airport, expected to be a hub for Continental Airlines and
United Airlines.
   The decision could help smooth the way for Chicago, Dallas
and other cities to build new airports or expand existing
ones.

   NORIEGA'S ATTORNEYS WIN a round in their efforts to get
paid.
   U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff ruled in favor of the
lawyers late Thursday in a hearing to determine whether three
European banks should release information about accounts that
may contain funds belonging to the deposed Panamanian leader.
   Manuel Noriega's attorneys, led by Frank Rubino, have been
trying to unfreeze about $5 million in assets from European
bank accounts so that Mr. Noriega will be able to pay for his
defense. In June, the U.S. government agreed to help the
defense lawyers unfreeze the assets.
   Mr. Rubino had subpoenaed records from the three banks --
Deutsche-Sudamerkanische Bank of Hamburg, West Germany; Union
Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, and the Marseille, France,
branch of Paris-based Credit Lyonnais -- in late June and
early July. The banks, however, moved to quash the subpoenas,
saying bank secrecy laws in their countries prohibited them
from releasing the documents.
   After hearing arguments Thursday, Magistrate Turnoff gave
the banks 14 days to comply with the subpoenas.
   The banks could appeal the decision to U.S. District Judge
William M. Hoeveler, who is presiding over the Noriega trial.

   JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL WAS HOSPITALIZED for observation
after suffering a fall in a hotel lobby in Chicago. The
82-year-old Supreme Court justice was in stable condition at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he was admitted on Friday
afternoon. Court officials wouldn't disclose whether Justice
Marshall had suffered any injury, but said he didn't have a
heart attack. Justice Marshall arrived in Chicago on Thursday
for the American Bar Association annual convention, but fell
on Thursday evening. He decided to return to Washington on
Friday to see his own doctors, canceling a speech he planned
to give tonight.
