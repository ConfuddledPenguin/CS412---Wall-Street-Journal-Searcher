   A group led by a New York investor, Mark Boyar, said that
it raised its stake in G.R.I. Corp., a Chicago-based
mail-order marketing concern, to 13.75%, and that it plans to
seek board representation.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Boyar
group said it is analyzing possible steps that G.R.I. could
take to increase the value of its common stock. In connection
with its G.R.I. investment, the group said it may take
certain actions it considers appropriate, depending on
various factors, including G.R.I.'s response to its request
for board representation. G.R.I. officials weren't available
to comment.

from June 29 to last Tuesday for $5.07 to $6 a share. In

shares closed at $5.625, unchanged.
