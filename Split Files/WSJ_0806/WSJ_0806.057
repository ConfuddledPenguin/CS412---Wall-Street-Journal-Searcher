   Maybe Saddam Hussein has done the world a favor. The Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait is the first major act of aggression in
the post-Cold War era. We may well be getting a first look at
how nations define their interests in the new world order,
and what it may portend for piracy and terrorism.
   It is of course too early for anything but the most
tentative suggestions. The political air in the Middle East
is even more volatile than usual. Mr. Hussein may have more
surprises in store. There is little prospect that his booty
can be quickly recovered, even if promised troop withdrawals
materialize. Still, we are somehow impressed that world
reaction in the immediate aftermath of the invasion was
remarkably positive.

   So far at least, few nations are hiding behind the sort of
craven silence or diplomatic mush -- speak that used to
attend these events. The condemnation of Iraq has been wide,
and many nations appeared eager to participate in the
economic punishment of Iraq.
   The United States, Great Britain and most major nations
moved quickly to freeze Kuwaiti assets lest they be
transferred to Iraq. The U.S. and the European Community
banned the import of Iraqi oil, and Japan has now joined.
Italy and France suspended arms shipments to Iraq, and now
China has done the same. The French and British governments
have sent warships into the Gulf to join the U.S. fleet.
   The vote in the U.N. Security Council to condemn Iraq was
14-0, with only Yemen abstaining. Finland, Romania, Ethiopia,
Malaysia, Zaire and even Cuba voted to condemn. Condemnation
statements also were issued by the governments of Austria,
Czechoslovakia, Venezuela, Mexico, Algeria and Poland. The
Arab league was divided, but Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon and (at
least rhetorically) Iran joined the condemnation. Most
telling of all, the Soviet Union announced it would cut off
arms supplies to Iraq.
   We understand that words are cheap, and yield to none in
our cynicism about so-called world opinion. Yet it's striking
that Col. Gadhafi's Libya was alone in what once would have
been a widespread stance, warning that any foreign
intervention would be regarded as "an aggressive act." Has
something changed?
   We suspect it has, and that the West and the U.S. in
particular should recognize the opportunities it opens. The
reaction to the Iraqi aggression is different because the
Soviet factor in the geopolitical equation is radically
different than it's been the past 40 years. During the entire
Cold War period, one of the chief worries of governments was
that any regional dispute would almost surely involve the
competing interests of the U.S. and Soviet Union, and thus
had the potential of escalating to the nuclear level.
Similarly, the Soviet Union's more bellicose clients -- Iraq,
Syria, North Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba, Arab terrorists --
fully exploited this grim assumption. Don't push too hard,
was the message, or the Soviet bear will rise up on its hind
legs.
   Well, the Soviet bear is flat on its back, more in need of
Western economic support than it is of Saddam Hussein's
not-very-reliable cash payments for Soviet arms. The Soviets
are preoccupied with problems at home, not interested in
expanding their costly empire, and not in a mood to be
manipulated by one-time regional allies. We are hardly
suggesting that the Soviet military machine has evaporated
into the mists, but surely the world's leaders can recognize
that there has been some marginal, significant improvement in
the nuclear threshold. In regional conflicts, there is now
more freedom to maneuver.
   While the world reaction will not put Saddam Hussein back
in his lair, it opens opportunities for leadership to that
purpose. Perhaps this time the French government might allow
American F-111s to overfly its territory. With President Bush
raising the possibility of stopping Iraqi oil exports by
shutting down the oil pipeline through Turkey, this would be
a good time for NATO to reiterate that an attack on Turkey
would be an attack on a NATO nation and by treaty an attack
on all.
   The favorable world reaction presumably sets a climate for
consultation and concerted action. In recent years
consultation has become a recipe for inaction, while
unilateral U.S. reaction has been a cause of Western
disunity. Perhaps this has changed, but the United States has
to recognize that it still bears the main responsibility for
leadership. We don't see West Germany, the much-lauded new
leader, volunteering to handle the Bully of Baghdad.
   Our hopes here may be overly optimistic. Probably Saddam
Hussein will make off with Kuwait, teaching the lesson that
piracy works. Still, we must stare directly at the reality of
a world that has before it a future of increased political
and economic interdependency. The global market of the future
won't work well unless its participants can at least
recognize that they have common interests. Some instinctive
lurch toward this recognition seems to be taking place around
Saddam Hussein's threat to the world's oil supply.
   The Iraqi problem is far from over, but Western and
especially American diplomacy ought to test the depth of the
apparent consensus, seeing whether it will support still
stronger actions. It's an early test of whether the
international community will do what's necessary to ensure
that the emerging world order remains orderly.
