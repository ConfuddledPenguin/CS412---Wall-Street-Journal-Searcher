   C.G. Cheleden, a director, was elected interim chairman
and a board committee was appointed to find a new chief
executive. Mr. Kerstetter agreed to remain at the company to
assume the chief executive's responsibilities during the
transition period, the company said.
   Star States also said it has decided against constructing
a new headquarters building in Wilmington, resulting in a
write-off of $8.8 million. The company posted a
second-quarter loss of $26.6 million, or $5.61 a share,
compared with profit of $610,000, or 13 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Star States is the parent company of Wilmington Savings
Fund Society, FSB, Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association, and several other leasing and financial services
companies.
