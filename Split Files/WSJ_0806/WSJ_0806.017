   It started when he told the British of Washington's plan
for a campaign on the Hudson. Then he turned over details of
the American troop strengths and the movements of the French
fleet. Finally Benedict Arnold offered to betray West Point.
   In "Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor" (William Morrow,
667 pages, $27.95), the first new biography of Arnold in more
than three decades, Willard Sterne Randall portrays Arnold as
a man at ease neither as a rebel nor as an aristocrat. He
lunged from supervising whippings to courting the chic women
of New Haven's most established families. Later he would feel
an outsider both among the American troops he commanded (and
betrayed) and the British troops he sought to lead.

   Benedict Arnold was a trader long before he was a traitor,
though in the end one would lead to the other. An artful
smuggler who openly identified himself as a partisan of the
American resistance to Britain, he lined up with the
Connecticut radicals who fought new British taxes and joined
the elite shock troops and undercover operatives of the Sons
of Liberty.
   But the principal tension in the portrait Mr. Randall
sketches came from the tugs between Mammon and Mars. Though
he became one of Connecticut's richest men -- his fortune
included ships, wharves, horses, carriages and servants --
his movement in New Haven society was curtailed by rumors of
venereal disease and stories about duels over a prostitute.
He sought respectability in the rebellion, leading volunteers
only days after Lexington and Concord and winning their
loyalty by feeding them in taverns along the way.
   For all his bluster and bungled relationships, he was a
remarkable military strategist, time and again coming up with
innovative ideas to frustrate the British or, often, to
outfox them. But the human element often blunted the
brilliance of his ideas, and it wasn't for nothing that an
Abnaki chieftain called him Dark Eagle. With 200 pounds of
gunpowder, 200 pounds of lead, 20 barrels of pork and 4,000
biscuits he set out to haul artillery east from the forts
around Lake Champlain. But soon the mission turned into a
race with Ethan Allen for glory (and for the prize money for
a captured British warship).
   Arnold undertook the first American offensive of the
Revolution, the first American invasion of a foreign country
and commanded the first American naval force. There was real
valor; Arnold personally led a charge on foot against a
British outpost, capturing both a fort and a man-of-war in a
crisp, smooth operation.
   Soon, however, flashes of temper overshadowed flashes of
brilliance. At one point during the northern campaign, a
tavern keeper barged into an Arnold meeting. As he put it, "I
took the liberty of breaking his head." His behavior
repeatedly brought on challenges to his authority that seemed
to grow in magnitude because of the decentralized, and
oftentimes disorganized, colonial war effort.
   Perhaps Arnold's most famous (though ultimately
frustrating) military operation under the American flag was
his idea for a surprise attack on Quebec. It took his men
through the lake and forest country of Maine, "a pathless
wilderness where only a few men in canoes had ever been
before."
   There were setbacks: The bateaux he ordered were sloppily
made and badly caulked. The light-infantry regiment designed
for long-range amphibious raids grew fatigued by weary
portages. The food supplies turned into soggy barrels of
maggoty mush. The weather grew cold and stormy. The rations
became so meager that one man ate a candle. Some of the force
deserted. Much of the ammunition was ruined.
   The Quebec mission didn't end with his retreat; for the
rest of his life he would fight charges that he had looted
Montreal. Soon Arnold would be passed over for advancement,
shunned by high society, rebuffed on strategic questions,
crippled when his leg was fractured by a musket ball at
Saratoga and, in his own words, "received with the greatest
coolness at headquarters."
   In a brisk narrative that gives a panoramic view of the
military and political scene against which the early days of
the nation were played, Mr. Randall shows how eventually
Arnold's interests turned again from patriotism to profit. As
military governor of Philadelphia, eastern Pennsylvania and
southern New Jersey, he bought goods unavailable to other
merchants, stocked his own basement with food, and began to
consort with British sympathizers, falling in love with Peggy
Shippen, herself a Loyalist. Finally -- besieged by political
battles, infighting, a court-martial and enormous financial
pressure -- he decided to have his revenge. He changed sides
in the greatest struggle of his time.
   He did it for love and for money, and probably for ego,
too; it was more than simply that, as Mr. Randall puts it, "a
young and beautiful woman was capable of helping Benedict
Arnold plot the greatest conspiracy of the American
Revolution." But there was a certain poetic justice to it
all. Shortly after he switched sides, Benedict Arnold
presented his British betters with a bill for his services.
