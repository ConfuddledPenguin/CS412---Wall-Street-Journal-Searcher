   With a pack of U.S. ad agencies jockeying for position in
Eastern Europe, Ogilvy &amp; Mather is to name an executive to
spearhead the agency's ambitious expansion plan in the
region.
   Ogilvy is expected to announce today the appointment of
Wolfgang Slupetsky, currently head of its Austrian office, to
oversee the expansion. Mr. Slupetsky also will oversee
Ogilvy's fledgling offices in Budapest and Moscow. Ogilvy, a
unit of WPP Group of London, opened an agency in East Berlin
last month.

   Alexander Brody, Ogilvy's head of international operations
and a man not known for taking things slowly, says Ogilvy
initially had planned to enter the rest of Eastern Europe
over a 10-year period. But with the political upheaval
transforming the region, "that has narrowed itself down to
the next two or three years," he says. "There is a sense of
urgency in getting there. Eastern Europe doesn't need all the
leading 50 agencies from abroad."
   Mr. Brody says his immediate goal is to establish
footholds in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Poland.
Czechoslovakia makes the list, he says, because it has
industry and a middle class. Yugoslavia is intriguing
because, despite a poor economy, it traditionally has had
more freedom than the rest of the Eastern Bloc. And Poland,
while in terrible economic straits, is the largest and
potentially most important of the countries.
   Ogilvy faces stiff competition in the race to expand,
though. Several ad agencies are already setting up shop in
some of those countries. Archrival Young &amp; Rubicam, which
already has operations in Moscow and Budapest, expects to
announce this week a joint venture in Czechoslovakia. It
plans to look at East Germany next, a spokesman says.
   Omnicom's BBDO unit, which earlier this year entered into
a joint venture in the Soviet Union, is in the final stages
of a move into Yugoslavia, says Bruce Crawford, Omnicom's
chairman. The company's DDB Needham agency unit is nearing an
agreement to enter Hungary, he says. "We look at Hungary and
Czechoslovakia as near-term, 1990-1991" prospects, Mr.
Crawford says. "It's what everybody is doing. All the major
people are looking at these markets."
   The Hungarian-born Mr. Brody, who before joining Ogilvy
had spearheaded international expansion for rival Young &amp;
Rubicam, has a reputation in the industry for wanting to
plant flags everywhere -- to leave his mark by expanding
first, fastest, in the most places.
   "It isn't who's first; it's landing on your feet," says
Omnicom's Mr. Crawford, who advocates a more cautious
approach and who, for example, has no immediate plans to
pursue Poland or some other Eastern Bloc countries.
   But Mr. Brody insists that "we aren't going in for ego
value. If our clients need us, we're there. If they don't,
there isn't much sense in being there."
   Mr. Brody says he created the new Eastern European
position because entering those countries requires a far
different approach than before liberalization. When ad
agencies entered Eastern Europe before the liberalization,
Mr. Brody says, they had little choice in creating ventures.
They couldn't own or buy companies, so they had to settle for
an alliance with one of a handful of government-owned ad
agencies. "Your partners were prescribed by law," he says.
Now, scores of independent marketing companies are springing
up, started by entrepreneurs and free of government
intervention.
   "Now we have an embarrassment of -- I won't call it riches
because none of these people are very well versed in
marketing -- but at least we have a choice," Mr. Brody says.
In East Germany, for example, rather than joining with one of
the state-owned agencies, Ogilvy set up a new ad agency using
local talent. Among the principals: a former professor and an
economist who had been financial director of a furniture
company.
   As Ogilvy attempts its expansion, it must grapple with a
problem faced by all major ad agencies: whether to move in on
new turf before or after big clients need the agency to be
there. Most big agencies take the cautious route, fearful of
setting up unprofitable offices with no major clients. Ogilvy
tends to be slightly more pro-active. "We're going in
response to moves that we see our clients making," Mr. Brody
says, "but we don't wait for them to knock and the door and
say, `Hey, Ogilvy, it would be nice if you were here.'"
   But he adds that some Ogilvy clients have already beaten
the ad agency into Poland and Czechoslovakia, and others are
expanding in other Eastern European countries. He notes
Ogilvy's fledgling Budapest office already includes such
clients as Shell, American Express and Mattel.
