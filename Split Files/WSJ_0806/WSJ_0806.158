   DETROIT -- The Jeep Cherokee is king of the hill. At least
that's what Chrysler Corp. says in its TV commercials that
show Cherokee standing alone at the top.
   Cherokee sales soared 43% between 1987 and 1989, when
"sport-utility" vehicles were becoming suburban
yuppie-mobiles. As virtually the only such vehicle with four
doors, Cherokee was uniquely suited to family use -- and had
one of the market's hottest niches almost to itself.

   But that was then. Now Cherokee is being challenged by a
host of four-door upstarts. Its sales (along with those of
its more upscale sister model, Wagoneer Limited) plunged 31%
in the second quarter to 30,247 vehicles. And its share of
the sport-utility market nosedived to 14% in the quarter from
21% a year earlier.
   "The four-door sport-utility vehicle is the family sedan
of the '90s," says Christopher Cedergren, director of
competitive assessments at J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a market
research firm. "And the market is getting pretty crowded."
   Leading the competition is Ford Motor Co.'s new Explorer,
which hit the market with a bang in March. In April, General
Motors Corp. launched four-door versions of its Chevrolet
S-10 Blazer and the GMC S-15 Jimmy; it will introduce the
upscale Oldsmobile Bravada this fall. Also, Nissan Motor
Co.'s four-door Pathfinder and Toyota Motor Corp.'s 4Runner
got off to brisk starts.
   And more rivals are coming. Later this year, Isuzu Motors
Ltd. and Suzuki Motor Co., will introduce four-door compact
models with base prices under $15,000, well below most of the
competition.
   All this activity could push sales of sport-utility
vehicles in the U.S. above one million a year by the
mid-1990s, some analysts expect, up from 844,449 last year.
Many buyers will never test their vehicles' off-road
capabilities, but they will revel in the "outdoorsy" image
that anything resembling a Jeep confers on its driver.
   As for Chrysler, the wave of competing products "just
means they have to fight a little harder," says Mr. Cedergren
of Agoura Hills, Calif.-based J.D. Power.
   "There are new entries in the market, and consumers are
looking at more than just the Jeep," acknowledges Lawrence W.
Baker, general manager of Chrysler's Jeep-Eagle division. He
expects a 10% drop in Cherokee sales in 1990, the largest
decline in six years; Chrysler sold 156,118 Cherokees in
1989. Jeep is preparing a counterattack. This fall it will
introduce the upscale Cherokee Briarwood, to replace the
Wagoneer Limited, and a four-door Cherokee Sport, an
"entry-level" version that's now available with only two
doors. Also this fall, Cherokee's standard four-liter,
six-cylinder engine will be boosted to 190 horsepower from
177, allowing Chrysler to tout the vehicle as the most
powerful in its class.
   "We created this segment and we have done very well," says
Mr. Baker. "We aren't standing still on this."
   But Jeep has some heavy hauling ahead, partly of its own
making. When Jeep had the four-door market mostly to itself
(the aging Isuzu Trooper and Mitsubishi Montero were only
token competition), it raised prices aggressively. Cherokee's
starting base price at entry level surged 24% between 1988
and 1990, to $14,595. But that's a bare-bones vehicle; it's
difficult to buy a Cherokee for much less than $20,000, and
it can cost as much as $27,000 to get the equipment most
buyers want.
   Many buyers, being well-heeled sorts, don't mind much.
"Price is as unimportant an issue for people buying
sport-utility vehicles as it is for people who buy luxury
sedans," says John Schnapp, who studied the issue for Temple,
Barker &amp; Sloane Inc. in Lexington, Mass., where he heads
automotive consulting. "They don't seem to be as price
sensitive."
   Nonetheless, Cherokee's price increases spelled
opportunity for competitors. Ford's top-of-the-line Explorer,
the Eddie Bauer 4X4 version, carries a base price of $21,433,
$4,792 lower than the comparable Cherokee Limited's base
price of $26,225. What's more, the Explorer is the longest
vehicle in the four-door market.
   The result: "The Explorer has exceeded even our
expectations," says Richard D. Anderson, marketing plans
manager for Ford trucks. "It's the hottest vehicle in the
truck market." In its first three months on the market,
Explorer outsold the vehicle it replaced, the two-door Bronco
II, by nearly 78%. In the second quarter, combined sales of
the Explorer and the discontinued Bronco II were about 46,000
-- 52% more than Cherokee -- up from nearly 26,000 a year
earlier.
   GM's Blazer and Jimmy haven't matched Explorer's success.
They have drawn unfavorable reviews from automotive
publications, and GM recently slapped rebates -- first $750
and now $1,000 -- on the models in an effort to jump-start
sales. But sales of the Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota 4Runner
both more than doubled in the second quarter compared with a
year earlier, thanks to the addition of four-door versions.
Toyota and Nissan, in contrast to Ford and GM, kept their
four-door vehicles the same length as their two-door models.
The companies say they figured their two-door models were
already long enough.
   A quirk in U.S.-Japan trade regulations makes the
four-door market especially attractive to Toyota, Nissan and
other Japanese auto makers. Two-door sport-utility vehicles
are considered trucks, and thus carry a 25% tariff. Four-door
models, however, are classified as cars and thus pay a far
smaller tariff -- so they're actually priced less than the
two-door versions.
   Isuzu's entrance into the competitive fray will be with
its Rodeo, making its debut in August with a starting base
price of around $13,000, the company says. It won't even be
offered in a two-door. In 1992, Isuzu is expected to go
upscale with its existing four-door Trooper model to compete
with the super-luxury Range Rover from England, which has a
starting base price of $39,025. Jack Reilly, chairman of
American Isuzu Motors Inc., says the new Trooper will offer
the same things as the Range Rover but at a lower price of
"conceivably $25,000 to $30,000."
   In the fall, Suzuki will launch a four-door Sidekick, base
priced at $13,599. Standard features on the Sidekick,
currently sold as a two-door, will include power steering,
AM-FM stereo radio and cassette and rear anti-lock brakes.
   The Rodeo and Sidekick may greatly expand overall
sport-utility sales. The reason: While people who now buy
such vehicles are willing to pay a hefty price, says Mr.
Schnapp, those who shop but don't buy give price as the
biggest reason. "There is a price barrier that is keeping a
lot of people out of the market," he says.
