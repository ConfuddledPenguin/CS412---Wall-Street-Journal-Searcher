   NEW YORK -- Statistical casualties of the oil war:
producer prices will suffer first, but consumer prices will
suffer longer.
   The July producer price index narrowly escaped impact from
the roiling of energy prices that occurred when Iraq seized
Kuwait as August began. Economists note the July PPI report,
due out Friday, is expected to gain only 0.2% in what's
expected to be the last mild inflation reading for some time.
The July consumer price index, due out next week, is also
likely to be relatively tame.

   But starting in August, the PPI could jump as much as one
percentage point and the CPI could log a gain of 0.5% to
0.8%, said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International,
a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   "It's unclear what to expect because oil prices are
changing by the hour," Mr. Englund said on Friday. But he and
others noted that one thing seems certain: the heavier
weighting of energy in the PPI forces that index to respond
faster and stronger to change while the CPI takes a while
longer to reflect price moves. But once ingrained at the
consumer level, energy price increases tend to linger,
largely because they become embedded in labor contracts and
long-term pricing strategies. Energy accounts for about 9.2%
of the PPI and 7.6% of the CPI, according to the government.
   The CPI is an especially pervasive indicator. Among other
things, it indicates the effectiveness of government economic
policy; affects wages of three million union workers covered
by collective bargaining pacts, and influences the income of
60 million Americans who receive benefits as diverse as
Social Security payments and school lunches.
   Mr. Englund noted that when oil prices jumped around
year's end, "the January PPI showed it hard while we saw
gains filter out several months in the CPI."
   In June, the PPI rose a moderate 0.2% and the CPI rose a
sharper 0.5%. Oil wasn't the only thing heating up inflation
forecasts last week. The July employment report was anemic in
most respects except wages: average hourly earnings rose 0.6%
to $10.09. That sort of higher inflation coupled with an
economy near standstill underscored economists' concerns
about stagflation.
   "That reflects the severity of the cost-push problem"
right at the time the economy is shrinking, said Donald H.
Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, New York.
"That's very reminiscent of stagflation," he added, "even
without the oil crisis."
   Analysts were reluctant to predict just how severely oil
prices could affect the economy down the road because there
is now so much uncertainty in the Middle East. Based on
movements through last Friday, Mr. Straszheim expected oil
prices to add 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point to the PPI and 0.2
percentage point to the CPI in August and September. Such
increases brought his overall PPI forecast to a gain of 0.7%
in August and a gain of one percentage point in September.
Mr. Straszheim's overall CPI forecast increased to a gain of
0.6% in August and 0.8% in September.
   "Your headlights aren't very much good after that, since
you don't know what's going to happen" in the Mideast, he
said.
   Economists added that the weak July employment data
virtually assured lower readings on July industrial output
and capacity utilization.
   Other economic indicators could also feel the brunt of
higher energy prices hitting just as the economy flattens.
Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc.,
Chicago, noted that higher oil prices could pinch consumer
spending. He added that consumers could be forced to pay
substantially more for petroleum products just as the
important services sector of the economy begins to cool.
Normally, a slowdown in the service sector -- which accounts
for about half of the CPI -- could set the stage for cooler
prices in that sector. "But energy could offset that," Mr.
Kahan said.
   For the moment, Mr. Kahan isn't making radical changes to
his full-year inflation forecast. "The problem is more than
the price increases we've seen to date. The problem is
uncertainty on how high prices can go," Mr. Kahan said
Friday. "We have to see if Mr. Hussein gets away with it."
   The week's only other major indicator is June consumer
credit due out tomorrow. The consensus view calls for an
increase of $2.5 billion, down from May's $3.9 billion.
