   With regard to your July 13 page-one article "Shadow Life"
about movie producer Dino Conte:
   I have been working in the entertainment industry for 18
years, as an executive and, as of late, as a screen writer.
Mr. Conte has been an inspiration to me and to my work. It
was Mr. Conte who purchased my first screenplay and
personally assisted me with its rewrites. I thank Mr. Conte
for the unselfish nurturing he gave me; he has helped me
persevere.

   I fail to recognize the article's purpose to enlighten me
or your readers. The article read as though it were a
fictional and malicious press release.
