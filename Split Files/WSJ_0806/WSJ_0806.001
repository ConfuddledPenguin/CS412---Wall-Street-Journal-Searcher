   BERLIN -- West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, by backing a
proposal to move all-German elections closer by seven weeks
to Oct. 14, is trying to ensure his own electoral victory
despite the growing economic costs of unification.
   The East German Labor Ministry reported Friday that
unemployment levels nearly doubled since June despite $7
billion in subsidies to troubled companies in July alone.
Economic experts believe three million East Germans could be
unemployed by autumn, or more than a third of the work force.

   Farmer and labor-union protests are growing, hundreds of
companies are going bankrupt, foreign investment remains low
and the overall financial burden of unification -- vastly
underestimated by the two governments -- has become a
political danger to Mr. Kohl that grows with each additional
week before elections.
   East Germany's woes could result in widespread street
protests during the campaign and growing financial pressure
on Mr. Kohl to raise West German taxes. Mr. Kohl has promised
to avoid raising taxes, although he retreated from that vow
in a television interview yesterday. Partially in response to
this bleak economic outlook, East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere proposed the stepped-up election plan that
would require his parliament to approve unification shortly
before all-German elections on Oct. 14. Currently, the
elections are set for Dec. 2.
   The plan was agreed to early last week during secret
meetings between Mr. de Maiziere and Mr. Kohl in Austria,
where the chancellor was vacationing. Both leaders have been
working increasingly closely and will be campaigning for a
common Christian Democratic party.
   Mr. de Maiziere argued that a more rapid unification was
needed to give investors and East Germans "political clarity
and thus economic security." However, his opponents believe
he is merely acting quickly before voters feel the entire
burden of unification. "The sooner the vote, the better the
Christian Democrats' chances of victory," says Baerbel
Bohley, a member of the New Forum, the major force behind
demonstrations against East Germany's communist regime last
year. "They want a vote before individuals feel the social
effects of economic and monetary union on their own skin."
   Social Democratic candidate Oscar Lafontaine, whose
electoral chances sank further with the prospect of early
elections, charged Mr. Kohl with "transparent manipulation."
His party will fight the plan when parliament returns early
from vacation this week to discuss an election treaty with
East Germany. The Social Democrats won't question East
Germany's right to unify with West Germany in October.
   Even the Soviet Union, which recently cleared obstacles to
unification, reacted with unhappiness to the de Maiziere-Kohl
proposal. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskykh said
his government expected unification to come in an orderly
fashion only after completion of the "two-plus-four talks"
between the two Germanys and the four World War II victors
and after the 35-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe gives unification its blessing. Mr.
Kohl said Friday he hopes to bring two-plus-four talks to a
close in Moscow in September.
   The two sides have also agreed that Berlin would become
the "capital city," but the "seat of government" could only
be decided by the parliament elected during all-German
balloting.
   Mr. Kohl's government has exacerbated the governmental
crisis in East Berlin that gave rise to the call for earlier
elections by rejecting increased financial requests from the
East German government, funds Bonn will sooner or later have
to invest in the country anyway. West Germany already plans
to spend $16 billion to cover the East German budget deficit
this year, but East Berlin's government last week said it
would need a further $7 billion.
   Bonn government officials have argued against giving more
money to East Germany until their institutions have more
influence on how funds are used. They also say the low level
of foreign investment in East Germany is partially the result
of continued legal and other uncertainties that unification
will do much to erase.
