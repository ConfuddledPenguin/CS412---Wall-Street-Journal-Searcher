   Diasonics Inc. said it settled a dispute with a Toshiba
Corp. unit over the final sale price to Toshiba of Diasonic's
ultrasound business.
   Under the agreement, the Toshiba unit will pay Diasonics
an additional $13.5 million, Diasonics said in Milipitas,
Calif.

   Diasonics completed the sale of its MRI division to
Toshiba America Medical Systems Inc. last November for $167.5
million plus the assumption of certain debt. But in February
Diasonics asked Toshiba for an additional $23 million to
reflect certain equity changes in the division prior to the
sale's closing date. The Toshiba unit balked, instead
demanding a $19 million refund from Diasonics.
   The accord resolves the disputes outstanding with Toshiba,
a Diasonics official said. Diasonics' stock closed at
$3.3125, down 18.75 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
The company disclosed the accord after the close of trading
yesterday.

   DIASONICS Inc. sold its magnetic resonance imaging
business to a Toshiba Corp. unit. In the July 11 edition, the
business that Diasonics sold was misidentified.
