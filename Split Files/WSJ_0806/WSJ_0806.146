   BRUSSELS -- Belgium's seasonally unadjusted unemployment
rate rose to 10.1% in July from 8.8% in June, but fell from
10.2% in July 1989, the Ministry of Employment said.
   The number of people out of work in Belgium totaled
352,255 in July, the ministry said. Unemployment historically
tends to surge in July because of the number of people
leaving school and entering the job market. In 1989, the July
rate rose to 10.2% from 9.1% in June.
