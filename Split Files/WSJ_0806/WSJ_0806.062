   American Realty Trust Inc., which holds mortgages and real
estate, said it is omitting its quarterly, to comply with
restrictions in a loan agreement, and instead will determine
dividends on an annual basis. The debt covenant limits the
Dallas-based trust's payments to its annual income, which
American Realty said it can't determine on a quarterly basis.
American Realty paid a quarterly of 20 cents a share May 15.
In 1989, it earned $5.2 million, or 60 cents a share.
American Realty, which hasn't reported first-quarter results,
said earnings continue to be hurt by mortgage defaults and
investment losses.
