   WASHINGTON -- Efforts to find a solution to the financial
problems facing Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a
major student loan-guarantee agency, may take several more
weeks as the Bush administration looks for a wider range of
options.
   When HEAF's problems surfaced last month, administration
officials said they hoped to work out an orderly transfer of
HEAF's estimated $9 billion student-loan portfolio to another
guarantee agency within a week.

   But officials haven't embraced either of the major
proposals before them -- one from the Student Loan Marketing
Association, the other from United Student Aid Funds. Both
agencies have proposed taking over HEAF's best loans, while
asking the government to pay the full amount of loans on
which borrowers default.
   Under the federal loan program, students borrow from
banks, and one of the nation's 55 nonprofit guarantee
agencies, of which HEAF and USAF are the largest, insures the
loan. The Education Department then reinsures the loan.
   In most cases, the Education Department pays the guarantee
agency 100% of the balance on defaulted loans. But that rate
can drop as low as 80% if the guarantee agency's payments on
defaulted loans exceed 9% of the agency's insured loans.
HEAF's problem is that it guaranteed a large volume of loans
to students in proprietary schools. More than one-third of
the borrowers who attend proprietary schools, which train
beauticians, mechanics and other trades, default on their
loans. As a result, HEAF is receiving a government
reimbursement of 80% on defaulted loans on which it's paying
banks and other lenders 100%.
   At issue is how much the federal government is going to
reimburse guarantee agencies -- and perhaps the lenders as
well -- for the loans in default. At a hearing before the
education panel of the Senate Labor Committee Friday,
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos noted that the federal
government has no legal obligation to banks and other lenders
to make sure they are reimbursed 100% on defaulted loans. He
said, however, that he was "optimistic that we will have in
place a way to keep the guarantees sound" within the next few
weeks. He gave no details of the current negotiations.
   As an alternative to the proposals before the government,
some U.S. officials suggest that the Education Department
might take over the HEAF portfolio, as well as its modern
computer operations in St. Paul, Minn., in some sort of
undefined conservator capacity. It isn't clear, however,
whether this is a real possibility or just a negotiating ploy
to encourage USAF and Sallie Mae to consider making changes
in their proposals.
   So far, government and industry officials have assumed
that after an orderly transition, HEAF would cease to exist.
But at a news conference Friday, HEAF Chairman Richard Hawk,
who complained that he had been excluded from recent
negotiations, said he may make his own proposal for keeping
HEAF alive. He declined to give any details.
