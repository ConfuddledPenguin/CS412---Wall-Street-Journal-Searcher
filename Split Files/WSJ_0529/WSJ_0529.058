   LOS ANGELES -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it fired about
150 employees that it alleges were involved in a scam
stemming from a company program that allowed employees to
borrow as much as $4,000 interest-free to buy personal
computers.
   The workers were ushered out of the aerospace concern's
transport aircraft division here after a two-month internal
investigation disclosed they were misusing the loans,
McDonnell Douglas said.

   "People were submitting phony bills of sale," said a
company spokesman. Some employees got the invoices from
co-workers who then received a cash kickback from borrowers,
the company said. The loans were supposed to be used to
purchase computers compatible with the company's, so
employees could work at home or become more adept at using
the computers.
   The scheme was uncovered by corporate accountants in
April, the spokesman said, and the investigation is
continuing. Eventually, as many as 200 employees may be fired
for participating in the scheme, McDonnell Douglas said.
   The company doesn't know how much money it may have lost
as a result of the alleged fraud, said the spokesman, but it
will seek restitution. The company hasn't filed a complaint
with the District Attorney's office, he said.
   McDonnell Douglas has canceled the program, in which more
than 5,000 employees have taken out the interest-free loans
since the program began in 1984.
