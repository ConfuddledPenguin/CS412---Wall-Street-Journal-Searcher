   NEW YORK -- Bairnco Corp.'s board elected Luke Fichthorn
as chairman, as expected. Mr. Fichthorn, 48 years old,
succeeds Glenn Bailey, the Bairnco founder who announced in
January his intention to retire.
   Mr. Bailey, 65, was also president of the holding company.
But a Bairnco spokesman said Friday he didn't know, and
couldn't find out, whether Mr. Bailey still holds that
position, which is Bairnco's top executive post.

   Bairnco said in January that Richard Shantz, 54, will
succeed Mr. Bailey as president at the completion of the
company's proposed spinoff to shareholders of its Keene Corp.
unit. The spokesman said that completion is imminent, and
will occur before the end of the second quarter.
   Messrs. Bailey, Fichthorn and Shantz couldn't be reached
for a clarification of their positions.
   Mr. Fichthorn is a financial adviser, and has served on
Bairnco's board since the holding company was formed in 1982.
Mr. Shantz is retired chairman and president of Kaydon Corp.,
a bearings maker that in 1984 was Bairnco's first spinoff.
   Keene, which Mr. Bailey started in 1962, initially was
Bairnco's predecessor; it became a subsidiary when Bairnco
was established. Keene makes heat-shielding devices for
aerospace, defense and commercial markets, and manages a $130
million investment portfolio.
   At the annual meeting, held in Orlando, Fla., the site of
its new headquarters, shareholders elected a new director,
Charles Foley, 51, to fill Mr. Bailey's vacated seat on the
board. Mr. Foley is president of Estabrook Capital Management
Co., a New York investment advisory firm that is beneficial
owner of 6.7% of Bairnco's stock.
   But the company adjourned the meeting until June 7 to
permit further solicitation of proxies on three matters: the
reincorporation of Bairnco in Delaware; a new stock incentive
plan; and a shareholder proposal on shareholder ratification
of auditors.
   The Bairnco spokesman said many shareholders whose stock
is held in street name didn't receive their proxies in time
to vote at the meeting.
