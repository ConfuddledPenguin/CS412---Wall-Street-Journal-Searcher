   BRUSSELS -- Japanese auto makers, slowed by their cautious
business culture and unfamiliar with Eastern Europe, remain
well behind their Western competitors in the race to enter
the former East Bloc.
   Toyota Motor Corp. moved ahead of most other Japanese
companies merely by saying that it and C. Itoh &amp; Co. are
studying the possibility of setting up an auto assembly plant
in Czechoslovakia with a local car manufacturer. Toyota
officials here said plans are at an early stage and no cash
commitment has been made. They said the company's major
effort in Europe still is a new plant in Burnaston, England,
that eventually will produce 200,000 cars annually.

   "We just have begun investigating the situation in
Czechoslovakia," said Hidenori Tsutsui, managing director of
Toyota Motor Marketing Services Europe SA. "Concrete
decisions are a long way off."
   Other Japanese car companies, with the notable exception
of Suzuki Motor Co., take a similar cautious view. While
Volkswagen AG, Opel AG, Fiat S.p.A. and other Western
manufacturers have announced ambitious investment programs
for East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe, the Japanese
have restricted their plans to information-gathering trips.
   "This is the European's own backyard," argued Nissan
Europe's president, Yoshikazu Kawana. "We don't know what the
market is in Eastern Europe, what kind of political and
economic system will be in force, and we don't have any type
of expertise there."
   In the early 1980s, well before the recent democratic
revolution, several Japanese car companies investigated
making Eastern Europe a low-cost production center for
cracking the Western European market. But the European
Community warned that Japanese cars produced in the
then-Communist countries would be denied entry under
anti-dumping restrictions. Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda
Motor Co. responded by expanding or building factories in
England.
   "What we're doing in England is tremendously expensive,"
said Nissan's Mr. Kawana. "Along with continuing to digest
our new U.S. plants, my opinion is that we aren't ready to go
it alone in Eastern Europe."
   The only solid foothold for a Japanese car company is
Suzuki Motor Co.'s recently announced deal to build 15,000
small cars a year in Hungary starting in 1992, eventually
increasing output to 100,000. Analysts pointed out that
Suzuki had been negotiating for almost five years with the
Hungarians and that, unlike much larger Toyota, Nissan or
Honda, it has no other European production facility.
   "The Suzuki deal came well before the recent warming" made
the region look so interesting, explains John Lawson, an auto
analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London. "Otherwise,
the Japanese don't really know what to do with Eastern
Europe."
   A potential deal between Daihatsu Motor Co. and Poland's
national auto maker, FSO, collapsed. Daihatsu had proposed
that FSO assemble 500 midsized Daihatsu Charades a month,
with all the parts coming from Japan. The Poles preferred a
larger direct investment. Earlier, Fiat had beaten out
Daihatsu for a much larger contract to build 160,000
subcompacts.
   The lesson may be that the Japanese are ill-prepared to
deal in Eastern Europe. Because of what he calls "language
and cultural difficulties," Nissan's Mr. Kawana said his
company would probably enter the region only in alliance with
a European manufacturer. "It's the only way we can understand
this new mosaic," he said.
