   Mannesmann AG said its group profit in the first quarter
"was at the good level of the year earlier," as sales climbed
5%.
   But the diversified West German steel and engineering
company didn't provide specific first-quarter earnings
figures.

   Mannesmann recently said last year's group profit had
soared 73% to 505 million marks ($300 million) on sales of
22.3 billion marks ($13.3 billion), a 9% increase.
   The company said that the "favorable conditions" continued
in the first quarter for most divisions. It said that gains
in its machinery-making and plant-equipment divisions, along
with vehicle technology, more than compensated for declines
in other groups.
   Mannesmann is benefiting from the inflow of business from
European manufacturers who are retooling their plants in
advance of the border-free Europe after 1992. Also, business
is being boosted by companies that are trying to expand
capacity to take advantage of the opening of Eastern Europe.
