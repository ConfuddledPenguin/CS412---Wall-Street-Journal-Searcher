   TORONTO -- The Ontario Securities Commission banned Gordon
Capital Corp. from principal trading in shares on the Toronto
Stock Exchange for 10 days because the securities dealer
didn't meet disclosure requirements when it inadvertently
ended up with a 42% fully diluted stake in an Ontario
company.
   The ban is the first of its kind in Ontario. Gordon
Capital, an aggressive brokerage firm that accounts for 12%
to 15% of the exchange's annual trading volume, said it
intends to appeal the ruling because its breaches of the
province's securities laws were unintentional.

   Principal trading involves trading on behalf of a
securities dealer's own account as opposed to trading as an
agent for a client. The 10-day ban was scheduled to begin
June 18.
   The commission also banned David Bond, Gordon Capital's
senior floor trader, from principal trading for five days
starting June 18.
   Evidence at the March hearing in the case showed that in
1988, Mr. Bond, trading for Gordon Capital's account,
inadvertently technically made a takeover bid for ITL
Industries Ltd., a Windsor, Ontario-based maker of steel
moulds for plastics manufacturers.
   Gordon Capital often takes stock positions for its own
account and commits its own capital to help client orders.
Gordon typically provided Mr. Bond with two million Canadian
dollars (US$1.7 million) for his trading activities, which
when margined at 25%, provided C$8 million of capital. After
deducting interest and other expenses, Gordon Capital split
profits from Mr. Bond's trades equally with him.
   In October 1987, Mr. Bond acquired on behalf of Gordon
Capital 10% or more of ITL's convertible preference shares.
Under Ontario law, Gordon Capital should have disclosed its
ITL stake as soon as it hit 10%, but it didn't.
   Mr. Bond continued to acquire ITL stock, pushing Gordon
Capital's stake to more than 20%, at which point its holding
technically had become a takeover bid for ITL. Still, Gordon
Capital made no disclosure of Mr. Bond's purchases, and by
November 1988, it held 40.3% of ITL's preferred stock and
3.5% of its common shares, giving it a 42% fully diluted
stake in the company.
   The hearing heard that Mr. Bond, a registered trader for
16 years, didn't know that under 1987 amendments to the
Ontario Securities Act, a takeover bid is triggered when
someone holds 20% or more of any class of a concern's
securities.
