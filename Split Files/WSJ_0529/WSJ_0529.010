   VIOLENCE FLARED in Armenia, and Moscow took steps to curb
panic buying.
   Soviet troops sent to the republic to quell ethnic unrest
clashed with Armenian nationalists in and around Yerevan. At
least 21 people were killed. Leaders of the republic declared
today a day of mourning. In Moscow, non-Muscovites were
barred from shops in an attempt to curb panic buying sparked
by last week's announcement that the Kremlin was raising
prices as part of a transition to a market economy. Populist
Yeltsin, meanwhile, renewed his bid for the presidency of the
Russian republic, offering to form a coalition with his
conservative opponents.
