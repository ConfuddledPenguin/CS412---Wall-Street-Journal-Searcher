   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it plans to close
its Watertown, Mass., service center by late summer and
consolidate the work in other service centers in Kansas and
North Carolina.
   AT&amp;T said the service center has experienced a steady
decline in operations over the past six years, leading to a
smaller work force. About 235 people are employed at the
facility, compared with 750 when the Bell System was broken
up in 1984.

   A spokesman said the center specialized in repair of
older, analog transmission equipment that is being replaced
by digital equipment. The company said employees affected by
the closing will have the option to accept early retirement,
retraining, reassignment and transfer to other AT&amp;T
locations.
