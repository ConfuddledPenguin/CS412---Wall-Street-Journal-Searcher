   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico extended through January its
anti-inflationary wage, price and exchange-rate controls.
   In renewing the plan, which had been set to expire at the
end of July, the government reduced the daily devaluation of
the peso against the dollar to four-fifths of a peso. The
devaluation had been one peso a day.

   The government didn't announce new increases in wages and
private-sector prices. But it increased the price of gasoline
12%, and said other public-sector prices might increase.
   Inflation has fallen to 19.7% in 1989 from 157% in 1987
since the plan was put in place. Inflation for this year's
first four months was 10.8%, a pace above the government's
target for the year of 15.3%.
