   Petroleum output is declining in the three Persian Gulf
nations whose overproduction led to the world oil glut and
the recent sharp fall in prices.
   That is the new assessment by several leading monitors of
OPEC production. They will be reporting estimates that total
production in May by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is down as much as 500,000 barrels a day or more
from the level in April.

   Such a production trend, if it holds, could have a major
impact on world oil markets by providing support to weak
prices. It was the apparent lack of follow-up to OPEC's early
May pledge to trim high output that led to the price drop of
more than $2 a barrel.
   The new May estimates are only preliminary and could prove
to be misleading signals for oil markets. Still, they should
provide OPEC with some breathing room and shrink prospects of
a runaway output race.
   The estimates differ some on how much OPEC is producing.
But it is agreed the major reduction so far is by Saudi
Arabia -- which appears to be producing slightly under its
quota of 5.4 million barrels a day -- and that there are
signs of modest cuts in both Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates, the chronic overproducers.
   "It's not out of the question for Kuwait, which has cut
back spot sales to U.S. customers significantly, to be down
200,000 barrels a day for the month to around 1.7 million,"
said Cristina Haus, who monitors OPEC production for Energy
Security Analysis, a Washington-based company that tracks oil
supplies world-wide.
   As a result, she has lowered the output figure she expects
to report for OPEC for May from a prior estimate of 23.5
million barrels a day. Now, she said, OPEC's May production
appears to be 23 million to 23.5 million barrels a day, down
from 23.7 million in April and more than 24 million in March.
   Some other monitors of OPEC production see May output
settling in a higher range of 23.4 million to 23.5 million
barrels a day. But that still would mean a drop of 500,000
barrels a day because they have revised upward their old
April estimates to some 24 million.
   "If we see another decline of 500,000 barrels a day in
June, that will be the one million total they were looking
for," said a European-based monitor of OPEC production.
Although the exporters had stated after their early May
meeting that they planned to reduce OPEC output a total of
1.4 million barrels a day through July, several leading oil
ministers had suggested privately that they believed oil
markets would be satisfied with a drop of one million.
   But even though the new production indications for May
could be a firming factor for oil prices, they still don't
end a major worry for many members of OPEC. Neither Kuwait
nor the United Arab Emirates will have yet met in full
reduction promises of 400,000 barrels a day and 200,000
barrels a day, respectively. The concern is that Saudi Arabia
will retaliate by raising its output back to 5.7 million
barrels a day.
   "If you take the May figures at face value," said a senior
OPEC official, "only the Saudis are down significantly. The
issue is how long they will stay down."
   Only last week, the kingdom may have signaled that its
patience was wearing thin. In an official government
statement, Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister,
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the early May accord,
noting that it had given its "word of honor" to market no
more oil than its official quota. He called on other OPEC
members to practice a similar production discipline.
   Still, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey,
which has close contacts with the kingdom, reported yesterday
that "the Saudis aren't now planning to take any steps to
review their present {production} policy until around
mid-June."
