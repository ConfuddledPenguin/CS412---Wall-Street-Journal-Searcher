   Sales climbed 6.7% to 2.026 trillion yen from 1.899
trillion yen, boosted by an increase in domestic sales and a
surge in exported parts for overseas production; revenue from
the latter more than doubled to 161.6 billion yen from 69.8
billion yen. Interest and dividends income rose 28% to 20.55
billion yen.
   The company decided to extend a dividend of 5.5 yen a
common share, up 10% from five yen a year earlier.
   Mitsubishi predicted sales of 2.2 trillion yen in fiscal
1991, up 8.6%; net income is seen at 22 billion yen, up 8.7%,
and pretax profit at 46 billion yen, up 11%.
