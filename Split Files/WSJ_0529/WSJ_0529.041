   There has been quite a bit of talk recently about how
individuals need role models, mostly, it seems, in law
school. Country singer Reba McEntire had an interesting
insight into all this while addressing, not a college, but a
Tennessee grade-school's commencement. She told the kids to
be careful not to mislead their younger school colleagues,
noting that her own idols were actually kids a few years
older than herself. Her advice: "Kids in the first grade will
be looking up to you, so watch what you say or do."
