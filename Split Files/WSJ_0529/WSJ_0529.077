   CHICAGO -- GNP Commodities Inc. and its chairman, former
Chicago Mercantile Exchange chairman Brian P. Monieson, were
ordered banned from the futures industry and fined $500,000
each, in one of the toughest actions ever by federal
commodities officials.
   The closely watched case hinged on charges that GNP and
Mr. Monieson failed to control allegedly renegade commodities
salesmen. If applied aggressively across the industry, this
enforcement standard could easily trip up other firms and
their top officers.

   An administrative law judge at the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission, George H. Painter, revoked the
registrations of GNP and Mr. Monieson and barred both from
trading on U.S. futures exchanges. Mr. Painter found that Mr.
Monieson and his firm failed to stop promptly the alleged
bilking of customers by some GNP salesmen.
   GNP and Mr. Monieson plan to appeal, and the sanctions
will be put on hold until the full CFTC or, beyond that, the
federal courts decide the matter. If the decision is upheld,
GNP would be forced out of the commodities industry. The
overwhelming portion of the firm's revenue came from the
commodities.
   One of the brokers was a close friend of Mr. Monieson, and
the judge found believable testimony that Mr. Monieson was
warned about -- and failed to stop -- the allegedly illegal
trading. Calling the small investors who were cheated
"virtually defenseless," Mr. Painter wrote in his 135-page
opinion: "The shame of this case is that GNP and Monieson
were so callously indifferent to the wrongs done to their
most vulnerable customers."
   The case has also received attention because of the
powerful figures who came to Mr. Monieson's defense. U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who served as Merc
president under Mr. Monieson, and current Merc chief Leo
Melamed, both testified as character witnesses for their
friend. Also, Jerrold E. Salzman, the Merc's powerful outside
counsel, represented Mr. Monieson in the CFTC case.
   Mr. Melamed and Mr. Salzman have said they saw no conflict
of interest -- even though the Merc was pursuing nearly
identical failure-to-supervise charges against GNP, though
not against Mr. Monieson -- because their friend wasn't
charged personally by the Merc.
   Former U.S. Senator Thomas F. Eagleton quit the Merc board
over the incident last November, saying Messrs. Melamed and
Salzman had improperly intruded into a government enforcement
action to protect their friend. The episode showed the
potential for conflicts of interest in the industry's system
of self-regulation.
   Friday, the Merc said it fined GNP $100,000 as part of a
settlement with the firm over the case, and that GNP is in
the process of reimbursing about $300,000 to customers who
were hurt by the brokers' actions. GNP neither admitted nor
denied guilt as part of the settlement.
   The two brokers involved, Norman Furlett, the longtime
friend of Mr. Monieson, and Ira P. Greenspon, were also
banned from the futures industry and fined $75,000 each. The
two earlier agreed to leave the business. Their lawyer, James
Koch, said he hadn't seen the decision yet and declined
comment. The two men, who live in California, have denied any
wrongdoing.
   They were accused of so-called trade allocation --
initiating trades without the required customer account
number and then keeping the winners for themselves and
placing the losers in customer accounts. According to
internal Merc documents not made public, for instance, during
the first two months of 1986, accounts they had including one
named Horse Trading had $62,372.95 in profits. Four customer
accounts the Merc examined had for those months combined
losses of $20,988.12.
   Mr. Monieson was warned at least five times about the
alleged cheating by GNP employees, the CFTC alleged. Mr.
Monieson denied this, but Mr. Painter didn't believe him, he
wrote in his decision. "It appears that Monieson's misplaced
allegiance to Furlett and Greenspon overshadowed his greater
duty to the customers they were defrauding," he wrote. The
judge believed one GNP worker's testimony that the worker was
told the alleged cheating was allowed to go on "because Norm
Furlett is Brian Monieson's good buddy."
   Mr. Monieson has contended that he didn't know about the
alleged cheating and that, as Merc chairman and head of GNP,
he was too busy to know of such relatively small matters. The
trading involved represented less than 1% of the volume
handled by GNP, which has a lot of big institutional
investors as clients.
   "The decision and sanctions are not rational," Mr.
Monieson said. "No firm could survive under that standard."
   Mr. Monieson said GNP will stay open for business during
the appeal process. Since the case began, he has sold off
most of GNP's so-called retail sales operations.
