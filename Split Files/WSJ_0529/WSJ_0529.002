   Rep. Bob Smith thinks one way to win votes in New
Hampshire is to annex part of Maine.
   The New Hampshire Republican, running in a heated primary
for a U.S. Senate seat, is expected to disclose soon evidence
showing that the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard -- currently found
in Kittery, Maine -- belongs to the Granite State. It's the
latest blow in a border war simmering since 1976, when the
states landed in court over where to draw the line on the
broad Piscataqua River that flows between them.

   The congressman can probably count on the support of most
of the 4,000 shipyard workers who commute daily across the
river from New Hampshire: They'd rather not pay Maine income
taxes. Victor Bourre, a shipyard worker who says he uncovered
the new evidence after searching through old, yellowed
documents, has been staging such tea party-like protests as
dumping Maine potatoes and a giant tea bag into the disputed
river.
   A spokeswoman for the 190-year-old shipyard -- on an
island connected by a short bridge to Kittery -- says the
Navy is "staying out of this one."
   But New Hampshire Attorney General John Arnold says that
the governor has asked him to look into the issue and that
the state might support a lawsuit. "I'm sure there will be
amicable discussions with Maine, which will prove fruitless,
after which I expect we'll move to file before the Supreme
Court."
   Under law, most state border disputes go straight to the
high court. The last such spat -- over lobstering rights --
was decided, in Maine's favor, when the justices agreed in
1976 that the border was drawn by a 1740 King's Court decree.
   Maine officials say their neighbors are just sore because
Maine bases its income-tax rate on the joint income of
married New Hampshire workers, even if only one spouse works
in Maine.
   Maine Attorney General James Tierney says he's ready to
cut a deal. "But we want {New Hampshire's} Mount Washington
and the turnpike tollbooths on the table," he says. Mount
Washington isn't near the border, but, he says, "We can
easily see it from here."
   It's a case of a congressman who's willing to go the extra
mile to fight taxes, "even if it's in somebody else's state,"
says Joseph Brennan, a Democrat and former Maine governor.
"Nice try, New Hampshire, but it won't work," he says. "Pay
your taxes."
