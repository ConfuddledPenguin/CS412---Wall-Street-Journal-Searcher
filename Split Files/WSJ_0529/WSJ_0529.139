   Boston -- Boston Ballet's new "Swan Lake" attracted a lot
of attention, largely because it was promoted not simply as a
dance event but also as an example of glasnost. According to
the company, the production represents "the first full-scale
collaboration between artists from the United States and the
Soviet Union on all facets of ballet production in the
history of Western dance."
   Obviously impressed by these claims, John E. Frohnmayer,
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, has endorsed
the venture -- apparently sight unseen -- as a contribution
to international understanding. Perhaps Mr. Frohnmayer should
have waited before speaking: The production has turned out to
be less an example of cooperation between two cultures than
an act of artistic appropriation on the part of the Soviet
participants.

   On paper, it's true, the American contribution to this
"Swan Lake" looks substantial. Bruce Marks, director of
Boston Ballet, conceived and produced it; John Conklin
designed it; Craig Miller lit it; Anna-Marie Holmes -- in
actuality, a Canadian -- helped to stage it; Jonathan McPhee
conducted it. Apart from a handful of Soviet guest artists,
virtually every dancer taking part in it is a full-time
member of Boston Ballet.
   In the event, however, the American component seems
negligible. The reason is simple: In ballet, identity is
style, and the style of Boston's "Swan Lake" was established
by Konstantin Sergeyev, assisted by his wife, Natalia
Dudinskyaya, former stars of Leningrad's Kirov Ballet and
currently directors of the company's school, who were
summoned by Mr. Marks to establish both the choreographic
text and the manner of its presentation.
   What lies behind the invitation to this famous pair, one
suspects, is the conviction that only in Leningrad have the
traditions of classical ballet been properly preserved. For
an authentic "Swan Lake," the thinking goes, one must turn to
the Kirov, where the definitive version of the piece was
given its world premiere in 1895, two years after
Tchaikovsky's death, and where the work has been in the
repertoire ever since.
   The search for authenticity is by no means
inconsequential. In the past three decades, "Swan Lake" has
been saddled with a number of egregious, even preposterous
interpretations, many of them designed to give the characters
greater psychological complexity and all of them betraying a
lack of belief in the self-sufficiency of the work. For
example, in Rudolf Nureyev's Paris Opera version, seen in
this country last year, the Prince evinces more emotional
interest in his middle-aged tutor -- a role played by Mr.
Nureyev himself -- than in the Swan Queen.
   Authenticity, however, is not simply a matter of deferring
to the original scenario. If it were, the Boston version
would be significantly truer to the original than the Kirov
version, which also is the work of Mr. Sergeyev. In Boston --
at the insistence, it appears, of Mr. Marks -- the Swan Queen
and her Prince are united in death, just as Tchaikovsky
intended. In Leningrad, they live happily ever after, just as
socialist realism dictated in 1949 (when Mr. Sergeyev's
production was new) and apparently continues to do right now.
   The change is not enough to validate the Boston version:
Like the Leningrad version, it is thoroughly vitiated by
anti-musicality. The essential spirit of "Swan Lake," the
element that gives the ballet its perpetual currency, is,
when all is said and done, its extraordinary score. At once
scenic, dramatic and poetic, it expresses with uncanny
conviction a belief in love as an irresistible, universal
force.
   To Tchaikovsky, Mr. Sergeyev has hardly listened. For one
thing, he has replaced virtually all the mime with passages
of indeterminate, vaguely expressive movement, thus ignoring
the clear distinction between narrative and lyrical
expatiation so clearly made in the music. For Tchaikovsky,
plot gives focus to the large poetic meanings that are his
true subject. For Mr. Sergeyev, plot simply is an impediment
to mood and atmosphere, which he takes to be the ballet's
point.
   Like so many artists associated with the Kirov, Mr.
Sergeyev regards music as the servant of dance rather than
its source, an emotional ambience rather than its structural
quintessence. For him, therefore, the dancer, and not the
composer, determines the rhythm and tempo of a performance.
Since the artists of the Kirov are taught to perform in
whatever manner suits them best, the clear intentions of the
music are sacrificed to their individual requirements. Since
few of them can dance with speed and sparkle, the
characteristic style of the company is slow and languorous --
even when such qualities are utterly inappropriate to the
task in hand.
   The self-same qualities, along with the deadening rhythmic
inertness that follows inevitably from the Kirov approach,
were only too evident in Boston, where the excellent
conductor, Mr. McPhee, evidently was encouraged to follow the
dancers -- and especially the Soviet guests -- rather than to
lead them. The results were interesting as well as
depressing, since the style of this "Swan Lake" minimized the
virtues of the gifted Moscow ballerina, Nina Ananiashvili,
who needs to be challenged rather than coddled.
   Finer by far was the company's resident ballerina
Marie-Christine Mouis, who, lyrical and brilliant by turns,
seems to have asked for the tempi specified by the composer.
Ms. Mouis's Prince, the Kirov's Konstantin Zaglinsky,
benefited from dancing with a musical partner, whereas
Fernando Bujones, the Prince to Ms. Ananiashvili's Swan
Queen, did not shine.
   What the company needs is a "Swan Lake" that will express
a specifically American set of aesthetic ideals. Our dancers
are swift, open and unsentimental -- classical rather than
romantic. They are, in any case, as much the heirs of Petipa
as their Soviet counterparts -- more, indeed, by virtue of
the influence on them, conscious or unconscious, of
Balanchine, the true successor to the great 19th-century
Franco-Russian ballet master.
   In one respect, at least, Mr. Sergeyev's "Swan Lake" was
useful: It reaffirmed what the Kirov revealed on its American
visit last season, when, rather limply, it tackled
Balanchine's "Theme and Variations": We Americans have
infinitely less to learn from the Soviets than they do from
us.
