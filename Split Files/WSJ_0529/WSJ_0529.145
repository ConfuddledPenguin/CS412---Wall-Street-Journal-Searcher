   NEW YORK -- The yen is expected to keep outperforming
other currencies for the time being, thanks to the gradual
renewal of confidence in Japan.
   With investors warming up to Japanese stocks and bonds
again and uncertainties about German monetary union
depressing the mark, it will be hard for the yen to stay
down, traders say.

   There's a feeling that Japan is "a comparatively good
place to be," says Douglas Ostrom, an economist at the Japan
Economic Institute of America, a nonprofit organization in
Washington, D.C., that is funded by the Japanese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.
   Judging from the yen's rally Friday, the mood about Japan
is undoubtedly upbeat. Late Friday here, the dollar was
quoted at 149.40 yen and 1.6824 marks, compared with 151.05
yen and 1.6830 marks late Thursday. The dollar's intraday low
of 149.23 yen was its weakest level in almost three months.
   In cross-trading Friday, the mark plunged to 88.80 yen
from 89.75 late Thursday, while the Swiss franc dropped to
104.95 yen from 106.00.
   In the last month, the yen has risen about 6% against the
dollar and the mark and 3.5% against the Swiss franc.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency
opened for trading at 149.02 yen, down a bit from Monday's
Tokyo close of 149.45 yen.
   Traders are encouraged by the strengthening even though
the yen has retraced only a fraction of the losses it
registered between January 1989 and last month.
   The yen was pounded by sales during that lengthy period
because of the series of scandals that rocked Japan's
government and the Bank of Japan's failure to tighten its
monetary policy aggressively enough to stem inflation worries
and boost the yen.
   Now that those hard times appear to be over, the yen is
apparently settling into a "more comfortable level" somewhere
between 145 and 150 against the dollar, says Daniel Seto, an
economist at the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. In early
April, the dollar hit a 39-month high of 160.30 yen.
   Mr. Seto and others say the rising interest in
yen-denominated investments has been important to the yen's
turnaround, particularly demand for Japanese stocks.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues finished at 32,793.88
Friday, up from levels around 30000 at the end of March.
Between the end of 1989 and late April, the Nikkei plummeted
24%.
   As for Japanese government bonds, the yield on the
benchmark issue was 6.89% in late Tokyo trading Friday, down
from 7.31% in mid-March, the highest yield recorded for a
benchmark security in six years. Japanese interest rates are
finally starting to work in the yen's favor after a series of
tightening actions by the Bank of Japan, analysts say.
   Higher rates are generally beneficial for a currency
because they may increase demand for interest-bearing
investments denominated in the currency. Also, yields on
deposits of the currency become more attractive in the
Eurocurrency market when rates rise.
   Many market participants believe "interest rates in Japan
have gone as high as they're going to go" at this time, says
Mr. Ostrom of the Japan Economic Institute. "We're more
likely to see (the yen) strengthen than weaken" during the
next few months, he says.
   But some traders argue that the yen isn't out of the
woods. "I'm still bullish on the dollar," says Takaharu
Fukawa, chief trader at Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking Co., New
York.
   His bullishness, he says, is rooted in expectations that
the U.S. economy's growth will strengthen later this year.
But Mr. Fukawa concedes that the dollar could run into
considerable trouble in the near term if important support
around 145 yen collapses.
   Meanwhile, analysts say one of the yen's main drawbacks in
the past will probably remain -- substantial movement of
Japanese capital to foreign nations.
   Investors from Japan and other countries had loaded up on
mark-denominated investments because of euphoria about the
toppling of the Berlin Wall last year and the prospect of
German monetary union.
   Although uncertainties about West Germany's future have
caused the mark to be shunned in the past few months,
Japanese investment in that nation will probably continue,
contends Mr. Ostrom of the Japan Economic Institute.
   "Japan sees itself as a source of capital," he says.
"They're interested in Europe in that sense."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $368.20 an ounce, up $1.70.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $367.25 an ounce.
