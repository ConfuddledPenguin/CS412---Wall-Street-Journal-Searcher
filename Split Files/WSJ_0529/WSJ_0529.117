   Subaru of America Inc., Cherry Hill, N.J., said it is
recalling about 285,000 cars because of a rear-suspension
problem that has caused at least four minor accidents but no
injuries.
   The distributor of vehicles made by Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. of Japan said the models being recalled are its
four-wheel-drive 1980 through 1984 sedan hatchback and
hardtop cars, and 1985 and 1986 hatchbacks.

   Subaru said continuous exposure to road salt may corrode
the rear suspension of the cars, making them difficult to
steer. A Subaru spokesman said about half of the 285,000 cars
are in geographical areas where large amounts of road salt
are used to aid snow and ice removal in winter. The company
said it will rustproof or replace the rear suspensions free
of charge.
