   WASHINGTON -- Although they may be an endangered species,
political action committees contributed a record $63 million
to House and Senate candidates during the first 15 months of
the 1989-90 election cycle.
   The heavy giving -- up 13% from the comparable period in
1987-88, and 51% above the 1985-86 period -- came as Senate
Democrats and Republicans were both crafting separate
proposals to ban PAC contributions to federal candidates as
part of campaign finance overhaul legislation.

   According to a study by the Federal Election Commission,
House candidates received 18% more PAC money than in 1988,
with Senate candidates seeing a more modest 3% increase. PAC
contributions to House candidates totaled $43.6 million,
while Senate candidates received $20 million. House
Democratic incumbents, who traditionally receive most of PAC
funds, are much less enthusiastic about restricting PAC money
than their Senate counterparts.
   Twenty-three PACs disbursed more than $1 million. The
largest PAC, the Democratic Republican Independent Voter
Education Committee (DRIVE), affiliated with the Teamsters
Union, raised $6.7 million during the 15 months covered in
the FEC study and spent $4.6 million. The next largest PAC,
operated by the American Medical Association, raised $4.1
million and spent $2.2 million.
