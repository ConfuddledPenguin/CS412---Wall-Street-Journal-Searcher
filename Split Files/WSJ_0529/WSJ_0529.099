   The Frankfurt-based chemical company's earnings fell
despite a modest 3.1% gain in world-wide sales to 7.09
billion marks from 6.88 billion marks.
   Overall earnings were dragged down by the chemical sector,
where despite a 6% rise in sales to 2.35 billion marks,
earnings fell by an unspecified margin. Degussa explained
that profit margins were tightened by foreign exchange
factors.
   In its other sectors, Degussa registered both sales and
earnings gains. The pharmaceutical division "posted good
results," the company said, citing a slight, though
unspecified, profit gain.
   Degussa said it is still negotiating the takeover of
U.S.-based Engelhard Corp.'s world-wide gold and silver
operations. A letter of intent was signed in March.
