   NEW YORK -- Cahners Publishing Co. agreed to acquire Sail,
the leading sailing magazine in the U.S., from Meredith
Corp., continuing its push into consumer magazine publishing.
The price wasn't disclosed.
   Cahners, the U.S. subsidiary of London-based Reed
International PLC, said Sail will join its Marine Publishing
Group, which includes Power &amp; Motoryacht, MotorBoat, and
Motoryacht International.

   Sail was an odd fit for Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith,
which publishes service-oriented magazines such as Better
Homes and Gardens, Ladies' Home Journal, Country Home, and
Metropolitan Home. Sail had a paid circulation of 163,000 in
December 1989, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
   But the sailing magazine may mesh well with Cahners's
other publications. "We have had pure power (boat) books, and
now we are adding a pure sail book," Neal Vitale, a Cahners
vice president, said, adding that the company will look for
other acquisitions in the boating field.
   Sail competes in a growing field of power boat and sailing
magazines owned by Diamandis Communications Inc., New York
Times Co. Magazine Group, and Times Mirror Co. Recently,
Times Mirror Magazines acquired two marine magazines, The
Yacht and Tournament Digest, which covers the salt-water
fishing tournament circuit.
   Cahners's mainstay still is business magazines, with 65
titles. But with acquisitions such as American Baby and
Modern Bride, Cahners now has 11 consumer titles.
