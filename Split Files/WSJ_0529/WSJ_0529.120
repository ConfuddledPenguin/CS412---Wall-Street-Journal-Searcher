   As part of the agreement, Carl L. Bixby, the president and
board chairman of Interface Systems, Ann Arbor, Mich., has
joined the board of directors of Sintec Peripherals.
Interface Systems said it also received an option to purchase
in 1992 the remaining 75% of Sintec Peripherals, along with
all of its wholly owned subsidiary, Sintec Supplies Ltd.,
which sells printer supplies in Europe.
   Interface said it is making the acquisition to expand its
share of the growing European market. Sintec Peripherals has
handled European sales and distribution of Interface Systems'
IBM-compatible printers since 1987.
