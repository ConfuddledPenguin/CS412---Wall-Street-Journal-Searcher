   In Centennial Park in Nashville, Tenn., "The Athens of the
South," there's a full-sized, concrete replica of the
Parthenon, and up there on the pediment with all the other
deities sits a statue of Ganymede, the cupbearer of the gods.
The model for this Ganymede of 1922 was eight-year-old
Randall Jarrell, who so charmingly lectured the sculptors
about Greek myths that they asked to adopt him ("I would have
gone like that") and who eventually became one of the great
American men of letters of this century. Poet, critic,
novelist, editor, translator, teacher, children's book
writer, the creator of 27 books in a 25-year career, Jarrell
is the often ebullient subject of this new life and works by
William H. Pritchard (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 338 pages,
$25), himself a distinguished critic and biographer of Robert
Frost and other modern poets.
   Jarrell "always seemed more alive than other people, as if
constantly tuned up to the concert pitch that most people,
including poets, can maintain only for short and fortunate
stretches," wrote the poet Elizabeth Bishop, one of the fond
and sometimes exasperated circle of his friends that included
Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Hannah Arendt, Peter Taylor,
Adrienne Rich and a dozen other cultural gods and goddesses.
Enfant terrible and wit, Jarrell was bedazzling, merry,
intimidating, difficult, cruel, inspiring, incomparably
generous. And if we can't speak of an Age of Jarrell, as we
might speak of an Age of Lowell (meaning the dark, tormented,
rich midcentury decades), we can't forget that it was Randall
Jarrell who discovered the American genius of Whitman and
Frost and wrote inimitably of Lowell and Bishop and Marianne
Moore and William Carlos Williams. He was famous for his
wisecracks and terrifying one-liners, but (as Lowell said)
praise "was the glory of Randall's criticism."

   With all great men and women of letters, right or wrong
judgments matter less than how they get to them: We read
Jarrell for the writing, not the final verdicts, for his
articulation of a way of being in the world. His
unsystematic, unacademic, colloquial style epitomizes the
energy and delight of America discovering itself and European
culture right after World War II. Although today Jarrell's
reviews and articles may seem too journalistic and
philosophically naive to some, it's Mr. Pritchard's argument
that Jarrell is seriously misprized and misread as both a
critic and poet.
   His student years at Vanderbilt were spent with mentors
such as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren
(the conservative Southern Agrarians and Fugitives of the
30s, the New Critics of the 40s), but Jarrell (a "radical
liberal") ducked politics and ideological and scholastic
controversy. His criticism was undogmatically aesthetic and
unmoralistically moral. He was a literary writer in love with
adjectives and metaphors: His prose transcends its occasions
and takes on a gleeful creative life of its own that embodies
his belief that precise, enthusiastic reading and responding
could create a true American civilization. With what he
called "a sad heart at the supermarket," he was no populist
but a cultural democrat. The following lines from his 1950
essay "The Obscurity of the Poet" in his greatest book
"Poetry and the Age" (available from the Ecco Press) have a
new vitality in the era of Vaclav Havel:
   "Art matters not merely because it is the most magnificent
ornament and the most nearly unfailing occupation of our
lives, but because it is life itself. From Christ to Freud we
have believed that, if we know the truth, the truth will set
us free: art is indispensable because so much of this truth
can be learned through works of art and through works of art
alone . . . And all these things, by their very nature,
demand to be shared; if we are satisfied to know these things
ourselves, and to look with superiority or indifference at
those who do not have that knowledge, we have made a refusal
that corrupts us as surely as anything can. . . . One of the
oldest, deepest, and most nearly conclusive attractions of
democracy is manifested in our feeling that through it not
only material but also spiritual goods can be shared: that in
a democracy bread and justice, education and art, will be
accessible to everybody."
   Mr. Pritchard guides us through Jarrell's youth in
Nashville and Southern California; his years at Kenyon
College in Ohio where he lived with Lowell and Peter Taylor
and was "instructor in English and Director of Tennis"; his 3
1/2 years in the Army Air Corps training navigators and
working toward some of his strong war poems; his nearly 20
happy years teaching at a Southern women's college in
Greensboro, N.C.; his two marriages; his extraordinary
friendships; and his appetite for sports cars, cats, Chekhov,
John Kennedy, Donatello, Mahler, pro football (especially
Johnny Unitas), Balanchine and the Brothers Grimm.
   Jarrell suffered a nervous breakdown in his last years,
made a suicide attempt at 51, then recovered his health but
died in a still-controversial car accident (which Mr.
Pritchard believes was not a suicide) in October 1965.
   Mr. Pritchard's fine biography and its companion volume,
his "Randall Jarrell: Selected Poems" (Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux, 115 pages, $17.95) -- presenting 50 of Jarrell's 290
poems from 1941 through 1964, including several from his
great last collection, "The Lost World," published a few
months before he died -- afford us an opportunity to approach
this remarkable literary figure and his world anew.
