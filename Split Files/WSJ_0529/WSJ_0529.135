   Cesar Gaviria, the newly elected president of beleaguered
Colombia, will continue his country's war on drugs, but will
seek to exact a price from the U.S. in the form of more open
markets for Colombian exports and more cooperation in
fighting drug consumption.
   The 43-year-old Mr. Gaviria emerged as the clear winner in
Sunday's elections, polling almost twice as many votes as
conservative dissident Alvaro Gomez. Antonio Navarro, the
leader of the M-19 guerrilla-group-turned-political-party,
produced a surprise that could portend a political
realignment by outpolling conservative Rodrigo Lloreda and
finishing third with about 13% of the vote.

   But Mr. Gaviria's victory was weakened somewhat by a
turnout of only 45%. This indicated that a campaign of
intimidation through murders and bombings, waged by the
country's drug barons and guerrilla groups, was largely
successful -- raising questions about the strength of Mr.
Gaviria's mandate to pursue the drug war.
   The boyish Mr. Gaviria becomes Colombia's youngest
president, succeeding Virgilio Barco, who launched the war on
drugs last August after presidential contender Luis Carlos
Galan was gunned down while campaigning.
   Mr. Gaviria, who headed Mr. Galan's campaign after serving
as Mr. Barco's finance minister and interior minister, picked
up the mantle and emerged as the toughest of the four major
candidates on the drug issue. At the same time, he wants to
continue the peace process with guerrilla groups, whose
crimes he views differently from those of drug traffickers.
   In his acceptance speech at a Bogota hotel, Mr. Gaviria
vowed that his government would bring drug-related terrorism
"to its knees." But he mixed this confident prediction with a
warning that Colombians were tiring of the heavy burden of
the drug war and could only keep fighting it if they got more
international support.
   "Drug trafficking is a multilateral problem, and
industrialized countries aren't doing much to confront the
problem of drug consumption," he said. "If they don't do
this, it will become increasingly difficult for the Colombian
people to understand that their sacrifice isn't being
matched."
   In an interview shortly before his victory, Mr. Gaviria
made clear he wanted help to go beyond the traditional U.S.
response of military support; he urged strong efforts to
combat money laundering and weapons trafficking. In addition,
he asked for economic compensation in the form of more open
U.S. markets for Colombian products, citing the estimated $1
billion that Colombia spent last year in its war on drugs.
   "Economic aid and military equipment are important," Mr.
Gaviria said, "but the Colombian people hope that in some way
the great economic effort that the country is making will be
rewarded by making it easier for our products to enter the
international market."
   He cited flowers and coffee as Colombian exports that
ought to be allowed greater access. U.S. officials say they
expect trade to emerge as a contentious issue with the
Gaviria administration, although Mr. Gaviria says he's
committed to continuing the progressive opening of the
Colombian economy begun by Mr. Barco.
   Another issue likely to surface is the extradition of drug
suspects to the U.S. Mr. Barco has used extradition as his
main instrument in the fight against Colombia's drug barons,
but Mr. Gaviria says it should be "a complementary policy,
not a principal instrument." Mr. Gaviria proposes, instead,
to undertake a broad effort to strengthen Colombia's judicial
system to enable it to try drug traffickers.
   Colombians also voted overwhelmingly Sunday in favor of
naming a constituent assembly to revise the country's
104-year-old constitution.
