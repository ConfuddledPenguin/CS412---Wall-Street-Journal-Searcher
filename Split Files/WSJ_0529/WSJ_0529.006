   Saving Graces

<TEXT>
   In our throwaway society,
   Replete with disposable planners,
   Perhaps we should try to preserve a few things --
   Like ethics and morals and manners.
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   Barren Soil
                                                                                                       

   The growth stock I bought
   May someday bear fruit,
   But so far, for years,
   It has yet to take root.
   -- Mimi Kay.
