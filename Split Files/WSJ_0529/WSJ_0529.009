   Your April 9 page-one story on the unions' bid for UAL
claims that "United has stagnated." This ignores what has
been happening at our company over the past two years.
   Last year, UAL produced the second-best earnings in its
history, and it placed two aircraft orders worth $19 billion.
One order was the single-largest aircraft order in
commercial-aviation history.

   Early this year, United announced that, based on
Department of Transportation figures, it has surpassed both
Japan Airlines and Northwest as the No. 1 trans-Pacific
carrier.
   This hardly sounds like "stagnation." And there is more:
United is entering the trans-Atlantic market for the first
time, and beginning service to Mexico City from three U.S.
gateways.
   In short, the facts and record of our performance during
the past two years speak for themselves.
