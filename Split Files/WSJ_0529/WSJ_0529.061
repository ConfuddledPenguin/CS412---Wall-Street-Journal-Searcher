   OTTAWA -- A Canada-U.S. panel upheld U.S. restrictions on
Canadian lobster imports, dealing a blow to Canada's
depressed lobster industry.
   The panel, set up under the Canada-U.S. free-trade
agreement, said the U.S. restrictions aren't a trade barrier
because they don't apply to imports alone. Canada complained
that the law violated the free-trade agreement, but the U.S.
argued that the restrictions were necessary conservation
measures.

   The U.S. law, which took effect last December, prohibits
imports of live lobsters smaller than the U.S. minimum legal
size of 3 1/4 inches. The U.S. size minimum is to tighten to
3 5/16 inches by 1992. The regulations are designed to limit
the catch of younger lobsters, which still are unable to
reproduce.
   Canada has less stringent size restrictions on its lobster
catches because Canada has a larger lobster supply and
because the Canadian lobsters grow in warmer waters, where
they mature faster and are able to reproduce sooner. Canada
also uses other conservation measures, including a shorter
harvesting season.
   Canadian exports of live lobster to the U.S. totaled
US$100.8 million in 1989. The Canadian lobster industry
estimated that the U.S. restrictions could result in a $25
million drop this year in Canadian lobster exports. The
decline is expected to increase as the U.S. increases the
minimum size of lobsters.
   The Canadian industry already is suffering from depressed
prices. Lobster prices have fallen in recent years because of
a high Canadian dollar, declining demand and a 45% increase
in landed catches since 1982.
   "Lobster fishermen who have had to suffer through
abnormally low prices are now faced with a restricted
market," Russell MacLellan, a Member of Parliament from Nova
Scotia, told the Canadian House of Commons. He called on the
government to provide assistance to the Canadian lobster
fishermen who would be hurt by the ruling.
   New England lobster fishermen have complained that
Canadian lobsters were flooding the U.S. market and
depressing lobster prices.
   In a minority finding, the panel, which includes three
U.S. members and two Canadian, said the U.S. restrictions
were a trade restriction as well as a conservation measure.
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Canadian Trade
Minister John Crosbie have 90 days to consider the panel's
report and decide what action to take.
   The importance of the dispute was underscored last year
when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made a personal appeal to
President George Bush. Mr. Mulroney called the president's
decision to allow the restrictions a "deep disappointment."
   The lobster ruling was the second fisheries dispute
referred to a panel set up under the settlement mechanism of
the free-trade agreement. The trade pact, which went into
effect in January 1989, seeks to eliminate most trade
barriers between the two countries. Last year, another panel
ruled against Canada in a case involving West Coast salmon
and herring. As a result of the ruling, Canada made 20% of
its salmon and herring catch available to U.S. buyers
directly without first being landed and counted in British
Columbia ports.
