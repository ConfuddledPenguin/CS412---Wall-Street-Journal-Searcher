   NEW YORK -- R.H. Macy &amp; Co. this week will court the
factoring companies vital to its retailing business,
following quarterly results that eased some -- but not all --
of its creditors' worries.
   Factoring companies provide credit to apparel makers and
other retailing suppliers. Last week, one major factoring
company, Heller Financial Corp., said it was tightening
standards on shipments to Macy, causing Macy's bond prices to
plunge. Macy, which went private in a 1986 management
buy-out, carries more than $5 billion in debt and has
reported a series of quarterly losses.

   This week Macy's chairman, Edward Finkelstein, has
scheduled one-on-one meetings with about eight of Macy's
largest factors. Following the past six months'
bankruptcy-law filings by Federated Department Stores Corp.,
Allied Stores Corp. and Ames Department Stores Corp., the
factoring companies "want to be reassured about Macy," said
Barbara Wedelstaedt, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   "A number of factors were hurt big with the Ames
bankruptcy {filing}," said Howard Davidowitz, a retail
consultant. "Now they are really on the alert. Macy lost
money in the Christmas quarter and they are still losing
money. It's a tricky situation."
   "Macy will have to assure the factors that the company is
cutting expenditures and has bank commitments for the next
six months," Ms. Wedelstaedt added.
   Analysts and lenders took some comfort Friday from Macy's
preliminary earnings report for its third quarter ended April
28. Its net loss narrowed slightly to $63.1 million from
$64.1 million the year earlier. The February-April quarter
usually is retailers' weakest of the year.
   "Their results were slightly above what we expected," said
Michael Cha, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Co. Like
most people on Wall Street, Mr. Cha focused on Macy's cash
flow -- its net income plus interest expense, taxes and
depreciation. Cash flow rose 4% to $160.2 million, even
though sales were flat at $1.49 billion.
   In the bond markets Friday, Macy's bonds generally rose
one to two points on Macy's financial news. The retailer's
bonds still trade at depressed prices, though; Macy's 14 1/2%
subordinated debentures due 2001 were quoted at 60 cents on
the dollar. At that price, they have a yield to maturity of
more than 23% -- an unsually high level even in the
high-risk, high-yield junk bond market.
   In its financial report, Macy didn't disclose its
inventory levels, but analysts said they believed they had
been pared from $1.48 billion as of Jan. 27. Macy has said it
wants to keep inventories lower than last year. Inventories
peaked at more than $2 billion in October 1989 and played a
role in the company's poor Christmas 1989 results.
   "The retail environment has improved," Mr. Cha said. "It's
temporarily back to normal. But I'm not certain it will
continue. We will have to watch the next Christmas
particularly closely -- and watch Macy's inventory levels."
   Analysts generally expect Macy to report cash flow of $140
million to $180 million in the next two quarters. That will
be only slightly above the quarterly interest expense from
its more than $5 billion in debt. Estimates vary widely on
how Macy might perform in its crucial Christmas quarter. But
most analysts say that if the company is to improve its
financial health, it must come far closer to the $390 million
of cash flow during the calendar 1988 quarter than the mere
$210 million of cash flow it showed last Christmas season.
   Manufacturers doing business with Macy expressed support
for the retailer but acknowledged that they were nervous.
   "Five years ago nobody ever questioned the financial
health of Macy," said Stanley Stern, president of Finity
Sportswear Ltd., a women's apparel maker that has done
business with Macy for 20 years. "We're a small company and
we can't afford to take a hit the way a Liz Claiborne could."
   Mr. Stern attributed Macy's problems to general industry
nervousness, but he noted that the company has consistently
failed to achieved its projected earnings levels. In
documents related to its 1986 buy-out, Macy had predicted it
would report a modest profit for the year ending July 31.
Instead, analysts say, Macy probably will post a loss of
about $200 million.
   This isn't a robust retail period, Mr. Stern said,
although many leveraged buy-outs such as Macy were predicated
on the theory that consumer spending would increase.
   Steve Stoller, president of the Karin Stevens Apparel
Group, said that that credit company is approving June
deliveries to Macy. "Everything is okay so far," said Mr.
Stoller, who does about $2 million at wholesale with various
Macy divisions. "I don't think we're seeing a Federated
situation here," he added, referring to the bankruptcy
filings by Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units last January.
   Mr. Stoller noted that Macy has been paying its bills
promptly and that he expects the company to pay its bills due
June l0.
