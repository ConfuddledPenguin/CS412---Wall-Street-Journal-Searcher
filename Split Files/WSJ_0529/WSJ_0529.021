   Monoclonal Antibody
   For Sneezes and Itches

   THE TEXAS biotechnology company Tanox Biosystems Inc. and
Ciba-Geigy Ltd. are joining hands to try to take the sting
out of insect bites and other allergic reactions.
   Such miseries as asthma, hay fever and swelling from bites
occur when an irritating substance called an allergen enters
the body. There, it links up with the antibody Immunoglobulin
E (IgE), triggering the release of a cascade of substances
such as histamine, which cause the familiar symptoms of
sneezing, itching and red skin. Conventional treatments such
as antihistamines mainly block symptoms.
   Now, Tanox and the Swiss giant are developing a monoclonal
antibody that would target and bind to free-floating IgE in
the body, rendering it harmless and preventing allergy
symptoms from surfacing. Researchers claim such IgE could be
removed without harm because healthy people have very little
anyway. Allergy-prone people have more IgE, suggesting an
excess amount lies at the root of their miseries.
   But not any antibody to IgE would do the trick. The
antibody can only target free-floating IgE. If it homes in on
IgE already bound to certain cells, it could trigger the
allergic reactions it sought to eliminate.
   Some experts take a "show-me" attitude. Daniel Adelman,
director of clinical allergy and immunology at the University
of California at San Francisco, notes that previous attempts
to nip allergies in the bud have failed. He says that the IgE
bound to cells still will be present to provoke an allergic
reaction, but adds that the Tanox model "sounds as rational
as anything else."
   Nancy Chang, Tanox president, says Ciba-Geigy produced a
monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE and that "worked" in
mice. She hopes to schedule human trials in 18 to 24 months.
Her deep-pocketed partners at Ciba-Geigy have purchased a 7%
stake in Tanox, betting tens of millions of dollars the
theory proves true.

   Injecting New Genes
   Without Using a Virus
                                                                                                       

   SCIENTISTS are trying to ease a big concern about gene
therapy.
   Most current technology involves using a virus to inject
new genes into patients, causing an irreversible change in
their genetic code. Skeptics have worried that even the
weakened viruses that are used could turn virulent again. A
new technique involves no virus, just the direct injection
into muscle tissue of the new genes, allowing them to
function on a temporary basis.
   Wick Goodspeed, president of Vical Inc., San Diego, says
this approach might give doctors an intermediate vehicle for
the delivery of gene-therapy treatment. It would offer a slow
administration of drugs, lasting longer than conventional
drug doses, but limited to a few days or months, unlike
permanent gene therapy.
   Bolstering the immune system of patients with AIDS might
be the ideal first target for testing the system, says Mr.
Goodspeed. A second use might involve injecting genes to
induce the killing of cancer cells. Thirdly, Vical may focus
on muscular dystrophy, a target of choice for a number of
different therapeutic strategies.
   "Our approach has conceptual appeal," says Mr. Goodspeed.
"Only time will tell if it has the inside track," he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Pinching Blood Supply
   To AIDS-Linked Cancer
                                                                                                       

   PROMISING LEADS have been reported in the attempt to quell
Kaposi's Sarcoma, or KS, a malignant growth of blood vessels
that occurs in deadly form in AIDS patients.
   Scientists at Repligen Corp., Cambridge, Mass., said
they're working with human platelet factor 4, or PF4, a
"potent inhibitor of angiogenesis," the formation of vessels
that channel nutrients to tumors. Interrupting this supply
line, they reason, may choke a cancer's growth.
   In experiments with researchers from Harvard Medical
School, Repligen scientists demonstrated that PF4 can prevent
growth of skin cancer and colon tumors in mice. Although KS
will be the first focus of human clinical trials of PF4, the
mouse studies suggest the potential for more general
anti-tumor uses.
   "The capability to inhibit angiogenesis could have
therapeutic applications for a broad range of diseases,"
including KS, says Judah Folkman, director of Surgical
Research Laboratories at Boston's Children's Hospital. "The
results of Repligen's research to date are most encouraging."
   KS won't be an easy target. Researchers still are puzzled
about where KS's cells originate and how they grow. Still,
Repligen's research director, Walter Herlihy Jr., believes
the natural protein might be easier on patients than other
therapies, though it could retard wound healing. He adds that
Repligen has international rivals, including Farmitalia Carlo
Erba of Italy and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. of Japan.

   Alzheimer's Families
   May Call This Number
                                                                                                       

   FAMILIES with at least two living members with Alzheimer's
disease who are interested in helping hunt for genes that may
cause the illness should call the Indiana University Medical
Center at 800-526-2839.
   Researchers at the university's Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center National Cell Bank have a federal grant to
gather data on Alzheimer's families as part of a world-wide
effort to locate the genes involved in the disease. A Lab
Notes column in last week's Wall Street Journal discussed
research at Indiana and elsewhere that has found the
approximate location of two genes that appear to cause two
distinct forms of Alzheimer's. But more families are needed
to complete the search.
