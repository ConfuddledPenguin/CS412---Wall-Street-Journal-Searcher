   I guess it would have detracted from the otherwise wryly
humorous tone of Pamela Sebastian's interesting article "OK,
What Rhymes With Vogue and Eats Raw Chicken Necks?" (page
one, April 23), but there was little discussion of what
becomes of dogs no longer seen as trendy (or that become too
big or aggressive), or that come out of puppy mills with many
handicaps and wind up being given up to animal shelters as
excess baggage and, if not adopted soon, killed. There is
already a severe overpopulation of dogs and cats, with
thousands put to death by euthanasia daily, yet some people
encourage more breeding in order to seem chic. I guess it
wouldn't be trendy to adopt a pet from a shelter (and so save
its life) or, perish the thought, actually watch what happens
to the no-longer-trendy-or-convenient animals put in pounds
or shelters.

   I write on behalf of a benevolent despot named Squire (a
thoroughbred Dalmation) who has taken umbrage with Ms.
Sebastian's treatise on the "dogue de Bordeaux" and other
inferior, indolent breeds of dogs.
   Squire is bright, intelligent, loyal and as good a
watchdog as you can find. He doesn't like "raw chicken
necks." He doesn't just eat and sleep as does Mr. Dogue de
Bordeaux. He is a loving friend.
   When I awoke this day, he was in a foul mood. When I
questioned him, he told me about Ms. Sebastian's reference to
the "in pets," a la Akita pups or a fox-faced "shiba inu",
the "bichon frise" plus the AKC's so-called top 10 breeds.
   Squire, who is 10 years old, is sitting beside me as I
write this. His mood has changed. He licked my hand. I fed
him a biscuit, and now there is peace in this domicile.

   In mentioning the "gripping dog" of the Canary Islands,
your article on "power dogs" provided an unexpected
etymological treat. After all, the Canary Islands were named
for the canines roaming wild there. (The bird was named for
its island home, not vice versa.) Having read the article, I
pondered the fact that the Greek word for dog is the root of
"cynosure" and "cynicism."
