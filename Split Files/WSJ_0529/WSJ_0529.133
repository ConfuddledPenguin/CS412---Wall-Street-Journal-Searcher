   Fleischer Museum, Scottsdale, Arizona: The first museum
dedicated to the California school of American impressionism
-- which capitalized on the intense sunlight and stunning
natural landscapes of the American West -- just opened its
doors to the public. Located inside the corporate
headquarters of Franchise Financial Corp. of America, the
15,000-square-foot museum showcases some 200 works by
painters such as Franz A. Bischoff (1864-1929), Guy Rose
(1867-1925) and William Wendt (1865-1946). The Perimeter
Center, 17207 North Perimeter Drive.
                                                                                                       

   Wichita Art Museum, Kansas: "We Like Ike" -- This unusual
show of more than 600 objects examines the Eisenhower
presidency and 1950s America. Visitors enter the show through
a hand-painted 12-foot-by-28-foot mural of the White House
and can see everything from Eisenhower portraits and campaign
materials (including the button shown here) to 30 of Mamie
Eisenhower's outfits; and 16 paintings by the president
himself, an accomplished amateur artist (see accompanying
illustration -- WSJ May 28, 1990). One gallery highlights the
Eisenhower years: the interstate highway system, the coming
of the jet age, and the addition of Alaska and Hawaii as
states. 169 Stackman, through July 8.
