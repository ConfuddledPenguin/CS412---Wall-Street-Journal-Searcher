   WASHINGTON -- A $4 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill,
signed into law by President Bush during the holiday weekend,
is a harbinger of fights to come with Congress over military
appropriations and aid to Central America.
   The measure includes $720 million in economic assistance
for Panama and Nicaragua, but the president was forced to
accept more than $2 billion in Pentagon cuts to help pay for
the increased foreign aid and accompanying domestic spending.

   The military reductions come as the Pentagon faces a $1.45
billion shortfall of its own in hospital and personnel
accounts, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's frustration
spilled over last week when he threatened to make budget
adjustments himself if an agreement can't be reached with
congressional committees.
   Panama will receive $420 million, but Nicaragua's $300
million is more urgently needed and important politically.
After years of war, there was broad support in Congress for
strengthening the fledgling Chamorro regime, and the
emergence of the new government is also seen as an
opportunity to rethink U.S. policy toward neighboring El
Salvador.
   The administration sidestepped the Salvadoran issue last
week, but as the threat of a Marxist takeover has subsided,
House votes show a loss of support for continued military aid
to the regime. Southern and Western lawmakers appear less
"anti-communist" than "anti-foreign aid," and this shift
gives the upper hand to liberal critics demanding that a
substantial portion of future military aid be withheld to
force both sides to end human-rights abuses and move toward a
settlement.
   On both military spending and El Salvador, the
administration has been most vigorously challenged in the
House, and the maneuvering discloses an often hands-off style
of Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Les Aspin has been left largely alone to
carry on his fight with Mr. Cheney, and in the El Salvador
debate, Mr. Foley stayed removed and appeared to cede
critical tactical decisions to the Appropriations Committee
or Rules Committee Chairman Joe Moakley (D., Mass.).
   This style fits Mr. Foley's image of himself as an
institutional leader, but as the nation's highest Democrat,
his distance angers traditional liberal backers who have a
stake in both issues.
   Mr. Aspin, for example, has support in the House
Democratic caucus for taking more money from strategic
programs to resolve the Pentagon personnel problem. But the
Wisconsin Democrat risks being isolated by Mr. Cheney and
more conservative leaders of congressional military
committees. Mr. Foley stepped in last week as an intermediary
with Mr. Cheney, but the speaker -- a past mentor and
protector for Mr. Aspin -- has been a picture of studied
neutrality on the underlying dispute.
   Similarly, in the debate over Central America, Mr. Foley
appeared reluctant from the outset to support a strategy
whereby aid to Nicaragua and Panama would be held up until
some resolution of the Salvador military-aid question. In a
private meeting, the speaker offered words of encouragement
to Jesuits lobbying for conditions on military aid, but he
was outwardly more diffident and seemingly irritated by
nettlesome questions of how to proceed on the legislation.
