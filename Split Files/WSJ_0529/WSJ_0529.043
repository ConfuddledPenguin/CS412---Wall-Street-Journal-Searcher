   The Department of the Interior said it plans to raise the
franchise fees it charges private companies to operate in
certain national parks.
   Concessionaires operating in parks that post more than $1
million in sales would pay 22% of gross revenues to the
government; the average now is 2.5%.

   Monopolistic concession contracts have been criticized by
those who believe the agreements are too favorable to private
concerns. MCA Inc. pays 0.75% of gross revenues to provide
services in Yosemite National Park. In 1989, the
entertainment company had revenue from Yosemite of about $85
million, and paid the U.S. a $635,772 fee.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan ordered a review of
concessions policy nationwide last December. Under his plan
to raise fees, 5% of revenues would go to the U.S. Treasury's
general fund, and 17% would be returned to the park for
maintenance and upgrades.
   Mr. Lujan also said he wants to reduce concessionaires'
ownership interest in park facilities. For example, the
Interior Department said it would cost the government as much
as $300 million to buy out MCA's interest in Yosemite. Under
the plan, the department could order the concessionaire to
use the 17% of its fee toward reducing its ownership
interest, until eventually the government would own the
facilities. The agency also plans administratively to shorten
concession contracts' duration and to review franchise fees
more frequently.
