   Congratulations to the State of California and its
campaign "to attack the image of refreshment and status" that
the tobacco industry touts for smokers, especially young
women ("California Ads Attack Cigarettes," April 11).
   Media outlets for the current California campaign include
only newspapers, television, radio and billboards. But, as
you state, "since 60% of tobacco users start smoking before
they reach high school," why not reach these "users,"
specifically impressionable young women, via women's
magazines? Unfortunately, this is the very place young women
are most likely to be influenced by smoking ads.

   The unwillingness of most women's magazines to omit
cigarette ads is purely financial -- they depend on the
support of the tobacco companies to stay afloat. But it is
ironic that, in doing so, these magazines are killing off
their own readership.

   Your article reports a welcome development to the extent
that many First Amendment experts have stressed that the
correct response to the objectionable "commercial speech" is
more speech -- not advertising bans.
   However, the financing of such counteradvertising by
higher taxes on cigarettes may be constitutionally
questionable because it amounts to forcing companies to pay
for the speech of their opponents.
   Besides, such social-issue advertising suffers from a lack
of clear-cut goals, apart from expressing opposition to a
particular behavior. Will it reduce smoking by 10%, or 5%, or
1%? Without specific bench marks, California officials and
anti-smoking groups will keep asking for more money, which
may be wasted, considering all we know about similar
campaigns against drugs or for belt-buckling.
