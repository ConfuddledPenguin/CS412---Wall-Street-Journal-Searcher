   BOSTON -- In liberal Massachusetts, conservative Democrat
John Silber is an unlikely candidate for governor. But the
combative president of Boston University, a political novice
who was virtually unknown to many voters a few months ago,
has surged to the front in recent polls.
   Which may not matter.

   Despite his lead, Mr. Silber might not even get on the
ballot for the Democratic primary, much less for the general
election. Only Democrats who get at least 15% of the delegate
votes at the party convention on Saturday are allowed on the
primary ballot. And although he is a favorite with many
voters, Mr. Silber isn't a favorite with party insiders, and
could fall short of the needed percentage.
   The possibility that Mr. Silber will be denied a position
on the ballot has become the central issue in the campaign.
His supporters say it is a case of the insiders trying to
keep control of the party. Mr. Silber compared the party
rules to the "white supremacist tactics" once used in the
South to keep blacks out of politics.
   Some of his critics say the rules are fine and that
candidates with Mr. Silber's politics don't belong on the
Democratic party ballot. "Those who emerge from ivory towers
shouldn't be shocked by what they find on the ground below,"
says Louis Elisa, president of the Boston chapter of the
NAACP and a critic of Mr. Silber.
   Mr. Silber, who columnist George Will recently termed "the
nation's most interesting candidate in 1990," has a
predilection for the inflammatory phrase that provokes and
outrages. He has produced headlines this spring for calling
Massachusetts a "welfare magnet." He called Lowell, Mass.,
the "Cambodian capital of the U.S." and suggested unmarried
mothers who have a second child should have their welfare
payments reduced.
   But Mr. Silber's comments, which he complains are
distorted by media and opponents, are playing well among some
voters. A recent Boston Herald poll of voters likely to cast
ballots in the Sept. 18 primary found that he has edged into
the lead with 28%, ahead of Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy's 23% and
former state attorney general Frank Bellotti's 19%.
   But despite recent endorsements, Mr. Silber remains short
of the delegate votes needed. He asserts the
delegate-selection system "should be embarrassing to people
who call themselves liberal and call themselves
inclusionary."
   In fact, much of the leadership is embarrassed. A Boston
Globe survey found eight of the state's 10 Democratic U.S.
congressmen favor changing the 15% rule. Some uncommitted
delegates say they will vote for Mr. Silber to get him on the
ballot, even though they won't endorse him.
   Ms. Murphy predicts that Mr. Silber will end up getting
the 15% he needs. But Mr. Silber, who says he is getting
close to having enough delegates, is worried: "I've been told
by an old Boston politician that they can steal an elephant
on the floor of the convention."
   Mr. Silber's strong showing among voters is something of a
surprise. A Texan with a Yale doctorate in philosophy (he
wrote his thesis on Immanuel Kant) he has had a stormy
20-year tenure as president of Boston University, where his
$275,000 annual salary makes him one of the nation's best
paid college heads. While boosting the school's reputation,
he has locked horns with students, faculty and trustees over
such issues as the Marine Corps' right to recruit on campus,
gay rights and faculty unionization.
   A slight, bespectacled 63-year-old whose right arm was
deformed at birth, Mr. Silber is generally conservative on
foreign affairs. His public support for U.S. policy in
Central America and refusal to divest stock of companies with
South African investments is an anathema to most
Massachusetts Democrats. He voted for Ronald Reagan and
George Bush in the last three elections. He denounces
abortion as homicide and calls some new prisons
"air-conditioned Taj Mahals."
   Still, many Democrats here have been disillusioned by the
collapse of the Massachusetts Miracle and the directionless
bickering of party leaders since Michael Dukakis lost his
presidential bid to George Bush in 1988. With a big deficit
and tax increases inevitable, some see a chance for
Massachusetts's dormant Republican Party to win top state
offices unless a conservative like Mr. Silber is nominated.
   Although many of his stands play well with conservatives,
Mr. Silber maintains that he is a traditional Democrat.
Indeed, many of his positions are far from orthodox
Republicanism. He favors stricter gun controls and opposes
the death penalty, arguing that it isn't a good deterrent and
is unfair to minorities. An ardent supporter of preschool
education, he favors expansion of early childhood programs.
   He is even enough of a maverick to talk about raising
taxes. He is pushing for a 12 cent-per-gallon gasoline tax
increase to put construction workers back to work, and says
that a temporary sales and income tax increase is needed to
pay off the $1 billion deficit accumulated by the Dukakis
administration. Mr. Dukakis announced he wouldn't run for
re-election as governor a year ago.
   And Mr. Silber can spout an idea a minute. Asked about
homelessness on a televised debate, he proposed spending
$100,000 to rehabilitate old rooming-houses rather than
ordering them closed for housing code violations. He says the
state should acquire abandoned military bases as
"prison-schools" where criminals would be forced to earn high
school degrees. He supports drug treatment on demand and says
it could be partly paid for by turning treatment centers into
"rehabilitative institutions" where patients could make
products for the state.
   Mr. Silber says his strongest suits are knowledge about
education and background as a manager. "I'm the only
candidate who's ever run anything complicated," he claims.
   After taking over as president of deficit-ridden Boston
University in 1970, he promptly remade the budget and now
boasts the school has run surpluses every year since. The
28,000-student school has an annual budget of about $570
million. During his tenure, the endowment has grown tenfold;
the faculty has been enhanced by such stars as Nobel prize
winner Elie Wiesel, and BU's reputation has been burnished by
special events such as the appearance at last year's
graduation of both President Bush and France's President
Mitterrand.
   Lately he has been criticized for investing some $60
million-equivalent to one-third of BU's endowment -- in
Seragen Inc., a biotechnology start-up that doesn't expect to
be profitable until 1995. Mr. Silber argues that the annual
investment is only 3% of the school's budget and should be
seen as part of its medical research program. However,
criticism heightened recently when the Boston Herald
disclosed that 10 of the university's trustees also hold
investments in Seragen.
   But many observers say the biggest question is how Mr.
Silber's autocratic management style would play in the give
and take of Massachusetts politics. In a debate with Mr.
Silber, Ms. Murphy said: "My leadership style is to bring
people together. I won't divide them."
   Mr. Silber argues that his tenure at Boston University
proves he can work with disparate groups. Besides, he adds,
he should get along well with the state's legislators because
"they'll know the reason for my election is that there is a
highly unusual match between my views and the views of the
voters of Massachusetts."
