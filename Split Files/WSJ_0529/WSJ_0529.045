   WASHINGTON -- Consumers continued to reflect optimism last
month despite an increasingly cloudy economic picture.
   Slowed by a decline in subsidy payments to farmers,
personal income grew a moderate 0.3% in April, the Commerce
Department reported, the smallest increase since a 0.2% rise
in September 1989. But personal spending rose 0.6% last
month, after rising 0.5% in March.

   Excluding farm subsidies, personal income increased 0.5%
in both April and March.
   Adjusted for inflation, spending rose 0.3% in April,
following a revised decline of 0.1% in March.
   Many analysts predicted consumer spending will continue to
grow, particularly in the service sector, while the
durable-goods sector will be constrained by declining sales
of automobiles and household appliances.
   "There will continue to be growth in the consumption
sector, which is going to be crucial to holding this economy
together in 1990," said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist at
Society National Bank in Cleveland.
   Many economists agreed the department's report presents an
optimistic picture compared with the statistics released
during the first three weeks of the month, which suggested
the economy was quickly weakening. "It's the first report in
two weeks on any economic data that was not considerably
weaker than expected," said Joel Prakken, vice president of
Laurence H. Meyer &amp; Associates Ltd. in St. Louis.
   However, other analysts believe the economy isn't growing
stronger. The government's economic indicators suggest slow
economic growth, but the government keeps revising them
downward, suggesting the country is headed for a mild
recession, said David Bostian Jr., chief economist at Jesup &amp;
Lamont Inc. in New York.
   "The economy has had a false dawn of recovery and is in
the process of slowing down again," said John Mueller, chief
economist at Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., an economic
forecasting firm in Arlington, Va. "We think the weakness in
the economy is real and will continue for the rest of this
year."
   Consumers saved 5.5% of their after-tax income in April,
down from 5.8% in March. The savings rate in February was
5.5%.
   The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on
personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted
annual rates in trillions of dollars.
