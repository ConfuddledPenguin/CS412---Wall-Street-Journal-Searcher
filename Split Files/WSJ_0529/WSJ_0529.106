   Partnership for a Drug-Free America, the group that
created the fried egg anti-drug commercial, is changing its
strategy by reaching out to kids as young as six years old.
   The Partnership, created four years ago by a coalition of
ad agencies and advertisers, thus weighs in, in the debate
over what is the right age to talk to kids about drugs. When
the Partnership first began, it concentrated its efforts on
preteens and teens as well as adults. Some of its executives
were skittish about bringing up drugs to first and second
graders; some childhood experts had suggested that at that
age, the commercials might just make kids more curious. Ads
using scare tactics especially were a concern, since kids
tend to be attracted to scary movies and stories anyway.

   But Partnership executives recently commissioned two ad
agencies experienced in kids' ads, Griffin Bacal and
Campbell-Mithun-Esty in Chicago, to come up with commercials
geared to six- to eight-year-olds. As far as anti-drug
activists and others are concerned, it's about time. Many
think kids should be reached at even younger ages than six.
   "We've been discussing this issue with the Partnership for
some time. We felt it was important to reach kids at an early
age -- earlier than the eight or 10 years old that the spots
that now exist target," says Harvey Dzodin, a vice president
at Capital Cities/ABC's ABC network.
   Karen Issokson, an associate director of the Partnership,
says the coalition never created ads for younger kids because
it didn't have the resources to do so, and wanted to
concentrate first on the more immediately vulnerable preteen
and teenage set. But she concedes that younger kids are an
especially difficult target because they are so
impressionable.
   "We didn't want to stimulate curiosity; that was one
important issue," she says. "We had to make sure the
message's thrust was undeniably anti-drug. It's very easy to
miss the boat when talking with young kids."
   The Partnership's move follows last month's airing of a
Saturday morning anti-drug cartoon special, "Cartoon
All-Stars to the Rescue," that ran simultaneously on all
three networks. The cartoon, which included animated
creatures from the Smurfs to the Muppet Babies, attracted 30
million viewers, 63% of viewers watching television at the
time.
   But a similar public service effort being considered for
the Partnership may run into trouble. Griffin Bacal presented
several ideas to the Partnership last week, including one
commercial featuring a popular animated character. Paul
Kurnit, the agency's president, declined to identify the
character, but said Griffin Bacal had considered the most
popular animated characters, such as the Simpsons and Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   The major networks, though, generally won't run ads using
cartoon characters whose shows air elsewhere. The Simpsons is
a Fox program, while the Mutant Ninja Turtles will appear on
CBS next fall. CBS did recently allow a public service
message with "fleeting exposure" of the Simpsons, notes
Matthew Margo, a vice president. "But obviosuly, we aren't
going to encourage the use of competitive characters. We'd
have to see if there was a very strong public interest
consideration for using it."
   Griffin Bacal's Mr. Kurnit concedes that "that's
definitely an issue. The networks are pretty skittish" about
giving the competition's cartoon characters air time, even
for a good cause. But he says, "we'll talk to the networks,
and I would hope the cause will rise over the economic
issue."
   Mr. Kurnit says his agency tested several possible ads
with kids, and that the animated ad and a scare-tactic
commercial were best received. In the fright spot, which Mr.
Kurnit dubs "a sleepover date run amok," a little boy going
to spend the night at a friend's house is greeted by an
ambulance, there because the friend's big brother has just
died of a drug overdose.
   Mr. Kurnit defends his agency's commercial concepts,
saying kids are much more cognizant than grown-ups think. He
notes that Griffin Bacal, whose typical fare leans more
toward perky Hasbro toy commercials, created the ad concepts
after interviewing six to eight-year-olds -- and their
parents -- to find out how much the kids knew about drugs.
   "We found that the drug education programs in schools are
getting better and better, and younger and younger, and
parents don't really understand how much their kids know,"
Mr. Kurnit says. "The kids, even the six-year-olds, are
savvier than the parents thought they were. It's a very
topical issue for them."

   Rubins May Join McCann
                                                                                                       

   McCann-Erickson is negotiating with Jack Rubins, the
former top executive at London's Dorland Advertising, to
become chairman of its U.K. office, a new position, industry
executives said.
   A spokeswoman for McCann, an Interpublic Group agency,
declined to comment.
   Mr. Rubins was a key executive in merging Dorland, a unit
of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., with Dancer Fitzgerald Sample in
1986. He later left the agency, however, after a falling out
with Charles and Maurice Saatchi.
