   NEW YORK -- Parlux Fragrances Inc. said its board resolved
a dispute over business strategy with Ilia Lekach, a director
and major shareholder, by expanding its membership to nine
directors.
   The arrangement effectively hands control of the board to
Mr. Lekach and his associates.

   Parlux said it expects to report a significant loss for
the year ended March 31. The firm also said that several
companies have expressed interest in buying one of its
divisions.
   Parlux Chairman Fred Purches said three newly created
board positions were filled by business associates of Mr.
Lekach. Since another of Mr. Lekach's associates already sits
on the board, the arrangement gives control of the board to
Mr. Lekach's group, which holds a 32.6% stake in Parlux.
   Parlux said one of the new directors, Robert Kaufman, will
also join the company's corporate ranks, as executive vice
president/special assistant to the president. The other new
directors are Zalman Lekach, who is Mr. Lekach's brother, and
Jerome Falic.
   In return for the changes, Mr. Lekach agreed to drop his
request for a special shareholders' meeting to consider the
removal of three Parlux directors. Parlux said Mr. Lekach
also won't seek further changes in the composition of the
board, or in the officers of the corporation.
   "This was an argument between gentlemen," said Mr.
Purches, who said the disagreement centered on whether Parlux
should sell off some or all of its operations -- as Mr.
Lekach wished -- and on the timing of any possible sales.
"There is no real animosity," he added.
   Mr. Purches refused to quantify the likely loss, or
identify the division that has attracted interest from
possible buyers. Perlux, which Mr. Purches said has annual
revenue of "well over $20 million," announced Feb. 28 its
intention to consider the sale of the company, or of some of
its assets.
