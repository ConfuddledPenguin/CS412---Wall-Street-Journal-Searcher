   TOKYO -- Profits tumbled at Japan's commercial banks in
the year ended March 31 as soaring interest rates and
financial instability boosted borrowing costs.
   Four official rate increases in the year, and the
accompanying increases in market interest rates that
followed, narrowed the margin between lending rates to
customers and the rates at which banks borrow funds for their
operations. By the end of the year, the Bank of Japan's
discount rate was 5.25%, more than double its level of 2.5% a
year earlier. The discount rate is the central bank's base
rate on loans to commercial banks.

   Competition for deposits, meanwhile, intensified in the
year as a result of the liberalization of interest rates. To
keep retail customers, banks have been forced to increase
rates on time deposits and other market-based instruments.
   The drop in earnings had been expected in the wake of the
recent sharp fall in Japanese financial markets and approval
of higher loan-loss reserves by the Ministry of Finance.
Analysts were still cautious about the banks' future.
   "I don't really see any indication that the worst is
over," said Simon Smithson, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson
International.
   While most institutions posted gains in operating profit
of more than 25%, their net interest income plunged. Pretax
profit at most banks dropped at least 25%. Only two
commercial banks, Tokyo Bank Ltd. and Hokkaido Takushoko Bank
Ltd., posted growth in pretax profits.
   The drop in the yen's value in the fiscal year compounded
the bank problems by increasing the value in yen of loans and
other assets denominated in foreign currencies. The banks
must meet new standards for capital-to-asset ratios set by
the Bank for International Settlements by March 1993. Because
the Tokyo stock market remains weak, banks will have
difficulty raising new equity capital to offset the higher
value of their overseas assets.
   The banks are expected to emphasize growth in
high-yielding domestic operations in the current year to
increase their capital ratios. But to keep overall growth in
assets low, they will have to choose their new business
carefully.
   "What you're going to see is a substantially reduced rate
of growth in assets. There'll be an intensified concentration
on quality rather than quantity," said Brian Waterhouse, an
analyst at James Capel Pacific. "It'll mean slower growth,
but not negative growth."
   Sumitomo Bank Ltd., traditionally Japan's highest-earning
bank, said consolidated pretax profit fell 14% in the year
ended March 31 to 374.35 billion yen ($2.48 billion) from
436.14 billion yen a year earlier. Net income was 11% lower
at 184.26 billion yen compared to 207.760 billion yen.
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. had a 23.1% drop in pretax
profit to 301.823 billion yen from 392.711 billion yen a year
earlier. Net dropped 27% to 144.966 billion yen from 199.004
billion yen.
   Consolidated pretax profit at Sanwa Bank Ltd. slipped 3.5%
to 324.064 billion yen in the year from 335.749 billion yen.
Net was 162.365 billion yen, up a slight 0.1% from 162.194
billion yen.
   Fuji Bank Ltd. posted 313.007 billion yen in consolidated
pretax profit in fiscal 1989, 22% below 400.643 billion yen
the previous year. Net was 153.986 billion yen, down 16% from
182.152 billion yen.
   Mitsubishi Bank reported pretax profit of 270.982 billion
yen in the year, 24% below 355.799 billion yen a year
earlier. Net was off 11% at 149.853 billion yen compared to
167.350 billion yen despite a sharp drop in extraordinary
charges.
   Revenue growth at Mitsui Bank Ltd. was slow in the year
ended March 31 compared to other major banks, adding to the
problems of high interest rates and market skittishness over
its merger with Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. Consolidated pretax
profit at Mitsui fell 24% to 130.521 billion yen from 172.029
billion yen. Net was down 7.7% at 72.008 billion yen compared
to 77.980 billion yen.
