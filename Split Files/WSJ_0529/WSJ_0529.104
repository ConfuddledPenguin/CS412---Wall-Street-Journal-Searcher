   National Semiconductor Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., said it
entered a joint venture with NEC Corp. of Japan under which
National will sell certain NEC memory chips under the
National label.
   The pact shows how U.S. chip concerns are increasingly
taking on foreign partners to round out their product lines.
National's agreement covers NEC's static random access memory
chips, known as SRAMs, which are considered high-volume
standard parts. In recent years, National has been
specializing in making high-end parts for supercomputers and
other specialized products.

   National said the companies also agreed to explore future
cooperative efforts in SRAMs, including marketing,
manufacturing and technology. National said it would start
offering the NEC chips in July.
