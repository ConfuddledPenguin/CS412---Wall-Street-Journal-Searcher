   PARIS -- The average unemployment rate among the 11
leading industrialized countries eased to 5.9% in March from
6% in February, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
   The organization said jobless rates declined in nine of
the countries, with the most significant drops in Canada, the
Netherlands and Australia.

   The OECD average unemployment rate in this year's first
quarter was 6%, down from 5.8% a year earlier. But the
jobless rate has remained roughly unchanged since mid-1989.
European unemployment rates, however, have eased about 0.5%
on average, compared with a year earlier, with the greatest
declines in West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Britain.
   The organization said April unemployment rose slightly in
four of the six countries for which data are available.
