   ATLANTA -- In a major victory for Southern Co., the
Justice Department said it won't file criminal tax-fraud
charges against the electric utility holding company or its
Georgia Power Co. unit or any employees in an investigation
related to spare-parts accounting.
   Georgia Power said it may still face civil action from the
Internal Revenue Service over its method of accounting for
emergency spare parts, and, according to individuals familiar
with the matter, other aspects of a federal grand-jury
investigation of Southern Co. continue at a brisk pace.

   The decision not to prosecute follows a highly publicized,
20-month investigation into whether the utility's accounting
for emergency spare parts resulted in its underpaying federal
income taxes of more than $50 million in 1985 and 1986. The
accounting issue turns on the timing of tax deductions for
emergency spare parts: Georgia Power has taken tax deductions
when it purchased the parts, while the IRS's position is that
such parts generally should be expensed, or deducted from
taxes, only when they are put into use.
   Georgia Power's president, A.W. "Bill" Dahlberg, said the
company had consistently asserted that its method of
accounting was a valid one and that the matter should be
handled civilly, not criminally. Civil charges involve only
the issue of whether taxes are owed, while criminal charges
also include the issue of the taxpayer's intent to defraud.
   "Twenty months is a long period of time," Mr. Dahlberg
said at a news conference. "It has been arduous, it has been
difficult. . . . I guess I'm just pleased that they've
reached this outcome."
   The investigation has placed the company under a cloud,
damaged its public image, and hurt employee morale throughout
the system, which is the largest investor-owned utility in
the nation.
   Despite baiting by reporters, Mr. Dahlberg refused to
criticize the government. "I'm proud of the government coming
to a good conclusion on this," he said. However, many
employees have wondered privately why the U.S. attorney's
office in Atlanta seemed to handle the investigation with
such a penchant for publicity.
   For example, the grand-jury investigation became public in
August 1988 when the U.S. Attorney filed an affidavit for a
search warrant for Georgia Power's offices. Then-U.S.
attorney Robert L. Barr held a news conference regarding the
search.
   In an interview, Mr. Barr, who is now president of the
Southeast Legal Foundation and who says he has political
ambitions, said Friday that the purpose of the press
conference wasn't to promote publicity on the matter, but
rather to dispel rumors. He said he wanted to emphasize that
a search wasn't a charge of any wrongdoing "and to keep
everything in perspective."
   The IRS declined to comment.
   The spare-parts investigation began in 1988 after Gary
Gilman, a Georgia Power accountant, went to the IRS and told
agents the company had devised an "off-the-books" scheme to
disguise that it was accounting improperly for emergency
spare parts. He became a confidential informant for the IRS
and wore a hidden microphone to work, taping conversations
with key Southern Co. and Georgia Power employees about the
accounting method.
   The search-warrant affidavit, which lays out the
government's justification for a search, alleged that Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co., the utility's outside auditor, was also aware
of the accounting scheme. In a statement Friday, Robert F.
McCullough, managing partner of the Atlanta office of Arthur
Andersen, said the firm had maintained all along that the
allegations were "preposterous."
   Southern Co. spokesman Gale Klappa said Sunday that
Georgia Power simply used a personal computer to help it in
converting from one accounting method to another.
   Late last year, the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta
completed its grand-jury probe of spare-parts accounting at
Southern Co. and recommended to the Justice Department in
Washington that it be authorized to proceed with a criminal
tax-fraud case. Like all criminal tax cases, the matter was
reviewed by the main Justice Department's Criminal Tax
Division to determine whether the department should authorize
or decline a criminal prosecution.
   In January, Southern Co.'s outside attorneys, James C.
Fleming and two other Atlanta attorneys, met with officials
in the tax division for three days to present their
interpretation of events and to argue that no criminal
statutes had been broken.
   While company officials expressed delight at Friday's
announcement, their crowing was noticeably muted. The
beleaguered utility holding company isn't out of the woods
yet. As previously reported, a federal grand-jury
investigation is continuing to examine, among other things,
alleged improprieties involving Southern Co.'s pension fund
as well as alleged illegal political contributions.
