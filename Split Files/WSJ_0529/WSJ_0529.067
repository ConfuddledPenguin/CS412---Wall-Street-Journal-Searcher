   Apple Computer Inc. may well be Adobe Systems Inc.'s
largest customer, but last week the two companies had a hard
time computing together.
   On Friday, Adobe's stock plunged $15.25, or about 30%,
despite the company's raising of a disappointing earnings
projection made late Thurday. The revision followed an
unusual public debate between Apple and Adobe over the
strength of sales of Apple laser printers that use Adobe
software.

   On Thursday, Adobe surprised analysts by saying earnings
and revenue for the second quarter ending June 1 would be
sharply below analysts' expectations. And one of the main
reasons it cited was a 23% drop in revenue from Apple
compared with the first quarter.
   But Apple said the falloff wasn't that sharp, and Friday,
before markets opened, the two companies issued separate news
releases to that effect.
   Adobe said it had obtained revenue estimates from Apple
for the months of April and May and then used that
information for its quarterly estimate. Then, "Apple got back
to us and said the April number provided had been incorrect,"
Adobe said.
   An Apple spokeswoman tells a different story. "Adobe did
receive preliminary numbers for the months of March and
April. Adobe called to confirm the {quarterly} trend, but we
told them we did not agree with their analysis. They decided
to issue a press release anyway."
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Adobe stock
closed at $35.25 a share on volume of 8.5 million shares. The
drop, which was credited with prompting a wave of selling of
technology issues, came a day after Adobe's stock climbed
$1.50 to a high of $50.50 on anticipation that the company
would release positive news. Apple shares closed at $40, down
$2.
   In its revised forecast Friday, Adobe said it expects
earnings of 29 cents to 37 cents a share, on revenue of $33
million to $36 million. Although higher than the forecast
issued the day before, it was well below some analysts'
estimates of 51 cents a share and revenue of about $42
million. In the year-earlier quarter, Adobe earned $7.6
million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $28.1 million.
   Some analysts are still concerned that Apple's printer
sales are lagging, in part because of increased competition
from Hewlett-Packard Co. The Apple spokeswoman said the
company's printer sales are still "healthy."
   Certainly Apple's relations with Adobe aren't as close as
they once were. In July, Apple decided to divest its 16.4%
stake in Adobe, and last fall, Apple and Microsoft Corp. said
they would develop printer software that would compete
against Adobe's.
   Meanwhile, Adobe is only beginning to get some lift from
other potentially lucrative revenue sources, including
International Business Machines Corp., which in March said it
would start offering Adobe software with its OS/2
personal-computer operating system.
   Separately, Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that
tracks insider buying and selling, said that from Jan. 1
through April 30, Adobe insiders sold 501,153 shares,
compared with a total of 293,032 shares in all of 1989. In
April, a total of 90,000 shares was sold by Adobe Chief
Executive Officer John Warnock at between $37.75 and $38.25,
and a total of 40,000 was sold by Adobe President Charles
Geschke at between $39 and $40 each. Adobe officials couldn't
be reached to comment on the selling.
