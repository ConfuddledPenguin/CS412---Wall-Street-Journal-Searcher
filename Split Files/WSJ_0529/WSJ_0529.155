   Paul Tudor Jones II, one of the country's most successful
futures and options traders, pleaded guilty to a federal
charge of illegally filling protected wetlands on Maryland's
Eastern Shore.
   The guilty plea, unsealed Friday along with a seven-count
indictment against a project manager hired by Mr. Jones, is
the largest case ever prosecuted criminally by federal
officials for illegally filling wetlands.

   Mr. Jones, 35 years old, is the founder and president of
Tudor Investment Corp., one of the most closely watched
trading firms on Wall Street. He pleaded guilty to a
one-count misdemeanor that carries a maximum jail sentence of
six months and agreed to $2 million in fines and restitution.
The charges stem from plans by Tudor to build a corporate
retreat and wildlife habitat -- Tudor Farms -- in Dorchester
County, Md.
   The indictment and the guilty plea were unsealed by the
U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore, which spent a year
investigating the case. "The filing of today's charges
reflects the seriousness with which this office and federal
law enforcement in Maryland view environmental crime," said
Breckenridge L. Wilcox, U.S. attorney in Maryland. "The
protection of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay wetlands is of vital
importance in the effort to arrest the Bay's decline . . ."
   Mr. Jones, emphasizing that the plea agreement will have
no impact on his company's investment operations, said that
Tudor Farms had been conceived as a conservation project and
that the firm retained 15 experts, including a project
manager, William B. Ellen.
   "We believed in error that our experts had properly
addressed the complex issues related to habitat development
in wetlands . . .," Mr. Jones said in a statement. "The
severe drought in 1988 . . . made it difficult to recognize
non-tidal wetlands. With identification so difficult, certain
permits to move soil on these wetlands were not obtained."
   Neither Mr. Jones nor his attorney could be reached for
comment.
   According to a copy of the plea agreement, Mr. Jones hired
Mr. Ellen to develop a corporate retreat for duck hunting on
3,272 acres of prime shore land that Mr. Jones bought between
1987 and 1989. More than half the land was marsh, and Mr.
Ellen was contracted to clear wooded areas, dig ponds, build
roads and fill in tidal areas with gravel.
   Federal prosecutors allege that Mr. Ellen filled in 86
acres of wetlands without a permit, despite an order to cease
and desist from the Army Corps of Engineers in February 1988.
Copies of the order were mailed to Mr. Ellen and Mr. Jones,
according to Mr. Jones's plea agreement, yet the work
continued unabated. Mr. Jones visited the site an average of
twice a month, according to federal prosecutors, but it
remains unclear whether he was aware of any problem over
proper permitting.
   According to his plea agreement, Mr. Ellen refused to stop
work and the project was only halted after the Corps of
Engineers contacted the independent contractors involved. Mr.
Jones expressed "surprise and dismay" when told the extent of
the damage in March 1989 and immediately fired Mr. Ellen.
   Since then, according to the plea agreement, he has
"cooperated fully" with plans to restore the land. Mr. Jones
agreed to pay a $1 million fine, another $1 million in
restitution and restore the damage done on his land.
   Mr. Ellen, of Matthews, Va., could not be reached for
comment. He was charged with six counts of knowingly
violating the Clean Water Act by filling in wetlands, and one
count of violating the Rivers and Harbors Act by dumping fill
material in navigable water. He faces a maximum 31-year
prison term and more than $1.5 million in fines.
