   NEW YORK -- Scott Black clocks more than 100,000 miles a
year in his search for undervalued companies. These days it's
taking him to some unlikely places.
   An old-fashioned value investor, Mr. Black, president of
Delphi Management Inc., Boston, is prospecting among
California banks, military service and trucking companies --
not exactly the year's most chic stocks.

<TEXT>
   From Puget Sound to Long Island Sound, he's found such
obscure companies as Eldec, tied to the rising fortunes of
Boeing, and Astrosystems, a military contractor whose stock
is trading at nearly half its book value.
   In Lebanon, Pa., Mr. Scott visits Arnold Industries, one
of the oldest holdings in the 11-year-old, $865 million
Delphi fund. Arnold, which owns the New Penn Motor Express
fleet of trucks that operates along the eastern seaboard,
consistently shows annual returns on equity above 20%.
   East of Los Angeles, in West Covina, he found California
State Bank. Despite the state's faltering real estate market,
California State Bank is growing at 10% to 15% a year,
although its stock trades at less than seven times estimated
1990 earnings. Further north in Sacramento, First Commercial
Bancorp, coming off a 38% jump in earnings last year, expects
to brake to around 15% growth this year. Its stock trades at
about 7.5 times estimated earnings.
   In Denver, U S West NewVector Group is a fast-growing
cellular telephone company, owned 82% by regional telephone
company U S West. Mr. Black conservatively estimates that the
company's assets, minus debt, are valued at $45 a share. When
he bought the stock at $30 a share, it was a "great asset
play." Even now, at 37 1/8, he still sees long-term value in
a company with 40% to 45% growth in quarterly revenue.
   Mr. Black shuns the shifting fads of the market for value
investing. Behind languishing shares, he looks for companies
with robust growth, little debt and internally generated cash
flow, among other factors. He prizes straightforward
accounting practices and long-range planning. If he's
investing in a traditional manufacturing company, he buys its
stock only at or below its tangible net value. If he's
investing in a company for its assets, he calculates those
conservatively and then buys stock at a substantial discount.
When investing in companies for their earnings potential, he
prefers buying shares that trade at 10 times estimated
earnings or less.
   His investing method requires patience. In the past
decade, Delphi has earned a 594.7% return, or 21.4% annually,
outperforming the S&amp;P 500's return of 403.9%, or 17.4%
annually. Last year, however, the fund underperformed the
31.4% return of the S&amp;P 500 with a 23.5% gain. "It was a
tough year for value," Mr. Black notes.
   Mr. Black's investing criteria include: Returns on equity
on average of 15% or higher; ability to grow revenue and net
income at a rate faster than inflation over a three-to-five
year period; cash flow generated from internal operations
rather than from borrowing or stock offerings; "clean"
accounting (for instance, banks and insurance companies that
adequately reserve for bad loans and losses) and, for
technology companies, a high turnover of inventory.
   Applying his criteria, Mr. Black finds value in the
following over-the-counter stocks:
   Eldec: "A surrogate for Boeing." Mr. Black bought Eldec at
$8 a share after the 1987 market collapse. Now at 11 1/2,
just above the Lynnwood, Wash., company's $11-a-share book
value, it's not the steal it once was. But Mr. Black likes
the long-term outlook of the supplier of parts for Boeing's
aircraft as business switches to supplying commercial, rather
than military, aircraft. Eldec has a $133 million backlog of
orders, up from $126 million a year earlier; his estimated
earnings for fiscal 1991 ending in March are $1.10 a share,
up from 90 cents a share. With practically no debt on its
balance sheet, "they don't have to worry about whether the
local bank will keep {them} in business," says Mr. Black.
   Astrosystems: "A turnaround, but not a runaway freight
train." Earnings for the Lake Success, N.Y., maker of
self-contained power systems for the military peaked at 55
cents a share in 1984 during the height of defense spending;
the company had a deficit last year. Mr. Black expects
Astrosystems to return to profitability this year as it
supplies power systems for 32 torpedoes funded by the
government. With book value at $6 a share, $5 a share in cash
and $5.50 a share in net working capital, the $3 stock is a
classic value play.
   Arnold Industries: "Probably the best in terms of
sustainable return on equity year-over-year." From its hub in
Lebanon, Arnold's fleet of trucks guarantees 24-hour delivery
to its East Coast customers. Its annual return on equity
since 1984 has been higher than 20%. Mr. Black estimates the
company has $4 a share, or a total of $27 million, in cash,
compared with $2 million in debt. At 34 3/4, the stock is
trading at about 10 times his estimated 1991 earnings of
$3.40 a share. "That's relatively cheap," he says, "for a
company of this quality."
   U S West NewVector: "For someone who wants a long-term
cellular play." Although U S West NewVector hasn't yet
reported a profit, the cellular company's revenue is "growing
by leaps and bounds" as it signs on more and more
subscribers. Thanks to its association with U S West, the
company already has digital technology, Mr. Black notes. He
estimates the company's assets are valued at $45 a share.
"It's a good company, well-run with a deep-pockets parent,"
he says.
   California State Bank: With a market capitalization of $29
million, the bank confines its commercial lending to
businesses with $100 million to $200 million in sales. The
bank develops some housing, with many of its housing sales to
Japanese "who pay in cash," according to Mr. Black. The
bank's reserves for loan losses are four times its
nonperforming assets. In 1989, California State earned a
return on equity of more than 16% and a return on assets of
1.5%, well ahead of the average among West Coast banks.
   First Commercial Bancorp: A new management team turned
this Sacramento bank around, says Mr. Black. The bank now is
fully reserved for bad loans. In 1989 it earned a 20.1%
return on equity and 1.86% return on assets, which Mr. Black
calls "sensational." Its commercial lending customers have
annual sales of as much as $500 million, with many of them
servicing the state government. Sacramento is one of
California's fastest growing cities.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   A plunge in Adobe Systems shares stopped the
over-the-counter market in its tracks Friday, but smaller
shares still fared better than exchange-listed issues.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 4.60 to 453.69, a 1.0%
decline. That was slightly better than the 1.21% drop in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. Declining shares overtook
advancing stocks, 1,105 to 825, as volume slipped to 152.2
million shares from 174.3 million Thursday.
   Adobe plummeted 15 1/4 to 35 1/4 on 8.5 million shares
after the Mountain View, Calif., software maker said its
earnings for the second quarter ending Friday will be lower
than expected. That drove the Nasdaq 100 index of large
industrial and technology issues 2.13% lower and spurred
profit-taking in other technology stocks.
   Microsoft fell 2 1/2 to 74 1/4; Apple Computer slid 2 to
40; and Quantum tumbled 1 1/4 to 21 3/8. Profit-taking also
took a toll on cellular, cable and other technology issues
included in the Nasdaq utility index, which lost 2.15%.
   Epsilon Data Management surged 6 3/4 to 18. Late Thursday,
American Express agreed to buy the Burlington, Mass.,
software and services company in a stock swap valued at about
$64 million.
