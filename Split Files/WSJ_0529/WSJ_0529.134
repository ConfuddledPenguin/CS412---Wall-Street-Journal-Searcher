   WASHINGTON -- Burt Rutan, a soft-spoken aircraft engineer
with a talent for making radical ideas fly, came to
Washington in April offering a solution to a
multibillion-dollar question that's been nagging Pentagon
planners for a dozen years.
   The question: How should the U.S. military handle close
air support for its troops? Mr. Rutan's solution: a $2
million combat plane made out of a plastic-like composite of
graphite and fiberglass designed to be more maneuverable,
simpler to build and maintain and far, far cheaper than any
U.S. combat aircraft currently on the drawing boards.

   It is a solution the Pentagon doesn't want to hear. The
Air Force told him it hasn't any need for such a plane. The
Army was even less hospitable. Officials, he says, told him
they regarded his plane as a threat to the Army's $39 billion
light-helicopter program.
   "Rutan's airplane is not under our consideration," says
Lt. Col. Don Black, an Air Force spokesman, who says the
A-16, an F-16 fighter modified with more electronic equipment
and safety devices, is the service's top candidate for close
air support. The defense secretary, he adds, will make a
selection from a number of candidates -- which don't include
the Rutan plane -- later this year.
   The 46-year-old Mr. Rutan has faced challenges before. He
is the designer of Voyager, the first plane that flew nonstop
around the world, and creator of the sailwing device that
brought the America's Cup back to the U.S. But the inner
workings of the Pentagon have him baffled. "I never knew much
about the politics of this. I just heard about it from the
periphery," he explains.
   Some Pentagon veterans see a parallel between Mr. Rutan's
experience and that of Christopher Spencer, inventor of the
first reliable repeating military rifle. After the Army
rejected his idea in 1860, Mr. Spencer went to the White
House and got President Lincoln to try a few shots. Then the
Army wanted it.
   "This will only get inside (the Pentagon) if there is a
super champion around someplace," says Robert Costello, the
Defense Department's former acquisition chief. He tried to
spend $1 million in Pentagon money to help Mr. Rutan build
his prototype two years ago. Mr. Costello resigned, however,
before the deal was completed and Mr. Rutan finished the
prototype himself.
   In theory, at least, he has the right idea at the right
time. He says his close-air-support plane sells for between
$2 million and $4 million, depending on electronic options.
Estimates of the cost of future competitive weapons systems
-- the Army's light helicopter and the Air Force's modified
F-16 fighter -- begin at around $13 million each and go well
beyond $20 million, depending on how the costs are
calculated, and they are being calculated very carefully now,
especially on Capitol Hill.
   Moreover, the Army's current helicopter program, the AH-64
Apache, is in big trouble. A recent General Accounting Office
report says that the $12 billion program has produced a
gunship that is so complicated that less than half of its 500
Apaches are combat-capable at any given time.
   Close air support is basically the art of shooting down
enemy helicopters and destroying tanks and troop
concentrations, often within a few yards of U.S. forces. It
requires maneuverability, good vision and, above all,
precision.
   It was the Army's own experiments at Fort Lewis, Wash., in
the early 1980s that the potency of Mr. Rutan's planes
against helicopter gunships was discovered. Called the High
Technology Test Bed, the project was designed to see whether
there was inexpensive commercial technology that could help
the Army. There was.
   A veteran helicopter-gunship pilot from the Vietnam War,
Maj. Jim Kreutz, put together two light, single-seater,
recreational airplanes from kits sold by Mr. Rutan. Maj.
Kreutz flew the tiny, composite planes, called the "Long-EZ,"
against helicopter gunships in over 80 missions, recording
the results with gun cameras.
   "It wasn't a 100% win situation, but I would say we
probably won 90% of the time," recalls Mr. Kreutz, who has
since resigned from the Army. The little, hard-to-see plane
almost always had the helicopter in its sights first and
could easily outfly it, he says, by staying above the
gunship, which is unable to shoot upward without destroying
its rotor.
   Mr. Rutan was retained by the Army to develop the plans
for a bigger plane that could carry a big gun. Then,
suddenly, everything seemed to go downhill. The Fort Lewis
project was closed down and Maj. Kreutz was told his career
was in danger. He resigned in 1985, and is currently an
aviation consultant in Graham, Wash.
   Mr. Rutan and Mr. Kreutz were operating dangerously close
to the invisible political seam between the Air Force and the
Army, an area of much turf fighting over the years. Since
Vietnam, the Air Force has agreed not to interfere with the
Army's plans for helicopter gunships as long as the Army
doesn't use airplanes with guns.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Rutan, a former Air Force test engineer,
built a fancier version of what the Army had specified, using
his own funds during slack time at his factory at Mojave,
Calif. (Mr. Rutan's company, Scaled Composites Inc., is now a
subsidiary of Wyman Gordon Co., Worcester, Mass.)
   He borrowed a turbofan engine long used on business jets
and installed a machine gun that is widely used in the
military services. He designed the plane with simple
mechanics and electronics that can be fixed in the field.
   The result, which he calls the Ares, made its maiden
flight in February, but the services haven't accepted his
offer to let them test it in simulated combat situations for
$3,500 an hour. "They (the services) are going to fight like
hell against this for a long time," predicts Rep. Denny Smith
(R., Ore.), a former Navy pilot who flew close-air-support
missions in Vietnam.
   Rep. Smith, whose exposure of faulty Pentagon testing
practices doomed the Army's projected $5 billion Divad
anti-aircraft-gun program, believes the Rutan plane might win
competitive tests because the use of fast-moving jets for
close air support often gives pilots very difficult,
split-second choices.
   "If the Air Force doesn't want to fly it," says the
congressman, "the Army should be given a chance to own some
and use them."
