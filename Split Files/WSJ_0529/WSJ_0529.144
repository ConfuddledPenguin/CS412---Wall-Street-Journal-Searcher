   NEW YORK -- One clue to whether interest rates will fall
further in the weeks ahead will be revealed on Friday, when
the Labor Department releases the potentially market-moving
employment report.
   In the mercurial bond market, the employment report has
become a potent economic indicator with the power to
instantly turn bond-market sentiment upside down.

   This week, the employment report for May will be even more
crucial in helping to shape investors' perceptions about the
economy's strength. Analysts will be looking carefully at the
report to see if the extremely weak employment numbers in
March and April were aberrations, or confirmation that the
economy is sluggish.
   "A weak employment report is the only thing that can get
the bond-market rally up and going again," said Sung Won
Sohn, a senior vice president at Norwest Corp.
   Immediately after the April employment report was released
on May 4, bond-market sentiment suddenly shifted from bearish
to bullish because the jobs data suggested that the economy
was much weaker than previous economic reports had indicated.
   In response to the report, prices of the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond jumped 1 1/2 points, or $15 for a bond
with a $1,000 face amount. Since then, yields on long-term
and intermediate-term bonds have fallen one-third of a
percentage point to about 8.7%, paving the way for lower
mortgage and other consumer lending rates.
   Another weak report for May would reinforce perceptions
that business activity is winding down and that eventually,
although not right away, the Federal Reserve may push
interest rates lower in an effort to stimulate economic
growth.
   But many economists believe a moderate or strong report
could create confusion and uncertainty, prompting bond yields
to remain at current levels or even rise somewhat. Susan M.
Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., said strong
employment growth could keep "the 30-year Treasury yield
trapped in its recent trading range above 8.50%."
   Mr. Sohn is more wary. He said a strong employment report
-- one that shows job gains in excess of 150,000 -- would
cause bond-market investors to focus on negative technical
factors and lead to widespread bearish sentiment.
   High on the list of negative technicals is the huge amount
of new bills, notes and bonds the Treasury must sell to
finance the thrift-industry bailout. Last week, Treasury
officials admitted that the cost of the bailout is soaring
and that the government may have to spend $300 billion over
the next 10 years to clean up the industry.
   The Treasury will have to borrow massive amounts of money
to finance the bailout, and that could put upward pressure on
interest rates.
   In addition, Japanese investors, who tend to buy large
amounts of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, have sharply
reduced their purchases in recent months.
   "The Japanese are not all that wild about participating in
the U.S. market; they have become reluctant buyers," said Mr.
Sohn. He said that Japanese institutions are searching for
investment opportunities in their own stock and bond markets,
which were severely depressed earlier this year.
   Those markets are now recovering, in part because the
value of the yen is rising and long-term interest rates in
Japan appear to be heading lower. Last week, for example,
Japan's major long-term credit banks lowered their prime
lending rate to 7.6% from 7.9%. The yield on Japan's
benchmark 10-year government bond, which peaked at 7.3% in
mid-March, was quoted at 6.9% on Friday.
   "Clearly, things have turned around for the Japanese,"
said Brian Fabbri, economist at Midland Montagu Securities
Inc. "This is taking some of the steam out of our market," he
said. The only way to revive the U.S. bond market rally, he
said, "is another piece of weak employment data."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were unchanged to lower in quiet pre-holiday
trading. Most investment banks and commercial banks closed
their bond trading operations at 2 p.m. EDT on Friday and
were closed yesterday in observance of Memorial Day.
   On Friday, a report indicating that consumer spending
advanced at a steady 0.6% clip during April pushed prices of
longterm Treasury bonds lower.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/8 point, a
loss of $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The price
of the benchmark bond ended at 100 25/32 to yield 8.66%, down
from Thursday's price of 101 13/32 to yield 8.81%.
   Short-term rates jumped. The discount rate on three-month
Treasury bills ended at 7.75%, for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.99%. That was down from a rate of 7.68%, for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.92%. The rate on six-month bills fell
to 7.75% to yield 8.16%, compared with 7.71% to yield 8.11%
on Thursday.
   In the junk-bond market, most prices ended unchanged. The
major exceptions were the bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co., which
gyrated wildly.
   The bonds, which fell a total of six points on Wednesday
and Thursday, staged a partial rebound on Friday due to
Macy's release of better-than-expected third-quarter
financial results.
   The New York-based retailer said its cash flow -- or
earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation -- increased
in the third quarter to $160.2 million from $154 million in
the year-ago period, based on preliminary results.
   The company's loss, after interest, taxes and
depreciation, in the period ended April 28, totaled $63.1
million, a slight improvement over last year's $64.1 million
loss. Sales in the third quarter were $1.486 billion, almost
unchanged from $1.482 billion a year ago.
   "These are very positive results for Macy's," said Andrew
Leinoff, a high-yield analyst who covers the retail industry
at McCarthy Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc. "What it means is that the
margins are a little better than last year, and the company
has recovered, as it stated, from its dismal performance at
Christmas."
   Macy's 14.5% subordinated debentures maturing in 2001
finished at a bid price of 60, up two points from late
Thursday. Macy's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures due in
1998 also finished up two points at 69, while its zero-coupon
bonds gained two points to end at 26.
   Despite these gains, Macy bonds have yet to recover fully
from the rout that took place earlier in the week. News that
Heller Financial Corp., a major factoring agent, shifted from
a "revolving credit" policy toward Macy suppliers to an
"order-by-order" policy triggered the declines.
   In the tax-exempt market, municipal bonds ended 1/8 to 1/4
point lower. Despite the declines, traders said the market
managed to digest more than $1.6 billion in new debt that was
issued last week.
