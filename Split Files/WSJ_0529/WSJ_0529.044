   WELLINGTON -- OTC Ltd. of Australia said it has formed a
consortium with Southwestern Bell Corp. of the U.S. to bid
for Telecom Corp.
   The government is selling New Zealand's state-owned
telephone company as part of a program to repay debt.

   But the Commerce Commission, New Zealand's antitrust
regulator, said that it has declined to give initial
clearance to OTC to make a bid. A fuller investigation of
OTC's application will be made immediately, the regulator
said.
   OTC, owned by the Australian government, has a monopoly on
Australia's international telecommunications.
   Peter Shaw, general manager of OTC's international
division, said OTC and Southwestern Bell have had talks with
a number of New Zealand companies about expanding the
consortium.
   "Nothing has been resolved there yet," said Mr. Shaw, who
wouldn't identify the local companies. OTC already has
business connections with Telecom through work on
communications links between Australia and New Zealand, he
said.
   Mr. Shaw declined to give details of the consortium's
financial arrangements, but said Southwestern Bell is the
major partner in the venture.
