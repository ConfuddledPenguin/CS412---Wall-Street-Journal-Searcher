   Separately, the company reported a $2.1 million loss for
the third quarter on revenue of $8.4 million, and said it may
not return to profitability as it had predicted. The company
cited revisions to a contract at its Belgian subsidiary,
Mecar S.A., and a spokesman said the margins on the $9
million contract with an unnamed country haven't been as
large as the company anticipated.
   The company said Allied Research, which designs and
develops high-technology products and weapons systems, "was
facing a variety of financial issues," but expected to
resolve them through more cost cutting and refinancing.
