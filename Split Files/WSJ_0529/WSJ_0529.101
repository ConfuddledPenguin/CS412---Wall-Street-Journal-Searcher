   WASHINGTON -- An advisory committee of the Food and Drug
Administration recommended that the agency approve a Merck &amp;
Co. drug to treat acute duodenal ulcers.
   The drug, Losec, is currently marketed to treat other
disorders, including severe heartburn. The advisory committee
recommended extending its use to people suffering duodenal
ulcers that fail to respond to such other drugs as Tagamet,
manufactured by Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories,
Philadelphia; and Zantac, made by Glaxo Inc., Research
Triangle Park., N.C.

   The advisory committee urged that Losec be approved only
for short-term use. Merck spokesman Gary Bruell said that the
company requested approval only for short-term use because
the drug was a powerful inhibitor of acid secretion. He added
that ulcer treatment is "typically short term."
   The advisory committee previously had expressed concern
about a possible cancer risk associated with Losec, according
to Dr. Stephen Fredd, director of the FDA's division of
gastro-intestinal and coagulation drug products. But Dr.
Fredd said that the committee was reassured by new human data
supplied by the company, and now agreed with the company that
the drug is safe for short-term use.
   A written statement released by Merck noted that two
studies of rats receiving Losec over their two-year lifespan
showed a dose-related increase in gastric carcinoid tumors.
The company, which is based in Rahway, N.J., said it found no
evidence of cancer risk for human patients, but that more
human data was needed "to rule out the possibility of an
increased risk of tumors from long-term therapy with Losec."
