   Is Dealt a Blow

   The judge overseeing LTV Corp.'s bankruptcy-law
proceedings dealt the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. another
blow last week, concluding that the pension insurer isn't
entitled to special treatment in the case and that its $2.23
billion claim against LTV's estate is way too high.
   While the decision was hailed as a positive one for LTV's
other creditors, the federal pension insurance and regulatory
agency warned that the ruling could reduce its potential
recoveries from LTV by as much as $1 billion. Such a
reduction would exacerbate the financial troubles at the
agency, which currently has about $3.2 billion in assets and
$4.2 billion in liabilities, the PBGC said.

   The ruling by federal bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
must be affirmed by a federal district judge to be adopted.
The PBGC said it plans to challenge the decision in federal
court.
   Disputes between the Dallas-based steel, aerospace and
defense concern and the Washington-based PBGC have become the
centerpiece of LTV's almost four-year-long tangle with
bankruptcy-law proceedings. The company sought protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code in 1986, in part because it couldn't continue to fund
its steel unit's pension plans. The PBGC terminated three of
those plans in 1987, assuming those plans' liabilities to
keep its losses from growing.
   But the agency ordered LTV to reinstate those plans and
pick up the tab after LTV implemented new retirement
benefits. LTV sued, and both a district court and a federal
appeals court ruled that the agency couldn't force LTV to
resume the old plans without proving that the company could
afford them. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in the
case in February, but hasn't issued a decision.
   Judge Lifland's ruling last week affects four pension
plans, including one that isn't involved in the Supreme Court
case. If his decision is affirmed, last week's ruling would
require that the PBGC be treated as a general unsecured
creditor in LTV's reorganization, rather than as a taxing
entity as the PBGC had argued it was. Under bankruptcy laws,
taxing agencies like the Internal Revenue Service are given a
higher priority in the reorganization and are paid ahead of
other creditors.
   In addition, Judge Lifland argued that bankruptcy laws,
not pension laws, should govern the discount rate that the
agency uses to calculate how much it needs to recover from
LTV to pay out future pension benefits. The PBGC, citing
pension laws, used a 7.5% discount rate in calculating its
$2.23 billion in claims. But most pension and investment
funds reap returns much greater than 7.5% on their
investments. Using a discount rate of, say, 10.5% would
reduce the agency's claim by $500 million or more.
   In assessing the agency's claims, Judge Lifland also found
some to be redundant. The PBGC said that based on the judge's
ruling, it could expect to recover perhaps $230 million from
the LTV's reorganization, instead of the $500 million to $1.5
billion it had hoped for.
   However, the ruling is "absolutely very good" for LTV
creditors who have to divide up just over $4 billion to
satisfy claims that now exceed $7 billion, said Gary Hindes,
chairman of the Delaware Bay Co., a brokerage concern
specializing in distressed companies. However, a
reorganization plan isn't expected until the pension disputes
are resolved.
