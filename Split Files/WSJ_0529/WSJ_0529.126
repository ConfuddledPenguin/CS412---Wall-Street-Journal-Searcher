   FRANKFURT -- West Germany shipped 69% more goods to East
Germany in April than a year earlier, according to the West
German Federal Statistics Office.
   Goods with a record total value of 1.17 billion Deutsche
marks ($695 million) were sent to East Germany in April, up
479 million marks from April 1989. The previous record for
one month was December 1989, the month after the wall
separating the two German countries was opened, when a total
of 1.01 billion marks was sent to East Germany. In March, 848
million marks of goods were sent.

   But data indicated that East Germany's economy continues
to languish ahead of the monetary and economic union with
West Germany, as East German shipments to West Germany
dropped 2% to 564 million marks.
