   Lee Berton's April 17 article on bad names for auditors
has caused quite a stir among the 35,000 members of the
Institute of Internal Auditors. We appreciate the fact that
Mr. Berton was intrigued enough by one of our publications to
write an article on it.
   In fairness to your readers and my profession, I feel I
must tell the rest of the story.

   It is true that two pages of the 137-page report "Roles
and Relationships in Internal Auditing" by Donna Wood and
James A. Wilson discuss negative names for auditors in the
context of the interpersonal dynamics of internal auditing.
Just prior to those pages, however, is a section on positive
names for auditors, such as good guys, helpers, team players,
guardians and so forth. The negative ones are a lot easier to
poke fun at, but the positive ones are far more accurate.
   As with any profession, there are many jokes about
auditors. Sometimes, less-than-kind names are used, but
seldom other than in jest. Fortunately, today, internal
auditors are respected members of the organizational team.
   We appreciate your interest in our profession. We look
forward to seeing more on internal auditors -- the good guys.
