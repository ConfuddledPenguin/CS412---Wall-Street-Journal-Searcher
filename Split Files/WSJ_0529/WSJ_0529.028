   Let's say your state's budget, now $54 billion, had risen
by about half in real per-capita terms under the current
governor.
   Let's say, further, that your state had gone on the
greatest lock-up binge since Prohibition, more than tripling
its prison population in the past decade.

   And say that it was spending a third more per
public-school child, in real terms, than it was in 1975.
   And that its welfare program, already among the nation's
most generous, was locked into "cost-of-living allowances" of
11% a year.
   And that its spending on natural resources grew at thrice
the inflation rate in the 1980s, while the debt service on
bonds has shot up 62% in just two years.
   Would you feel guilty about shortchanging government and
admit it was time to double the gasoline tax and loosen what
limits exist on spending? If you were part of the business
establishment in California, you apparently would. Titans of
industry generally back Proposition 111, the great hope of
the state's (and the nation's) public sector on next
Tuesday's ballot.
   Somehow an impression exists that parsimony has prevailed
for too long. Notwithstanding what instead were the ample
'80s, Californians with a hand or a heart in government's act
believe they've ridden in the back of the prosperity bus
since the tax revolt hit in 1978. And Gov. George Deukmejian,
the steward of the state's greatest growth years, is
finishing eight years of attempted prudence, during which he
blue-penciled nearly $6 billion in additional legislated
spending, by fronting for his longtime foes.
   The reason? Prop. 111 has two faces. One is the side Mr.
Deukmejian drew up to deal with what are arguably real fiscal
emergencies. The other is the sop he threw to the mainline
spenders. Voters get double or nothing. To get putative
relief from traffic congestion -- the basic pitch for 111 --
they surrender a basic tenet of what Paul Gann got the
electorate to mandate in 1979: that government may grow in
step with inflation or population, but is not entitled to
keep pace with the income of the people if that rises faster.
As society grows richer, the state must get by on the (hefty)
trust fund that had amassed up to the tax revolt.
   Although the leash has proved a loose one -- a third of
the budget isn't covered by Gann -- it rubs some necks rawer
each year. The pain can be real when some programs are
favored while remaining parts of the budget are choked
tighter than even Mr. Gann intended.
   Mr. Deukmejian is tied to -- and proud of -- a policy of
imprisoning multitudes of felons. The presence of loads of
young, crime-prone residents may have as much to do with this
as policy, but the tab's the same either way: $20,000 a year
for each of the 92,000 inmates. (The governor is pushing a
plan to make them work more of it off.) California thus pays
dearly for the criminalization of substances -- more than $1
billion a year in court and confinement costs to the state
for drugs-only cases. Add to that the local jails. No
official is rethinking this policy.
   The schools have been a particular thorn in this
governor's side. It didn't attract nearly as much notice as
Prop. 111, but the education lobby got a revision of the Gann
spending limit passed two years ago. That measure put a floor
(40% of state spending) under the funding of kindergarten
through junior college, and built in various boosters. The
voters bought it.
   The Deukmejian administration still stews over that ploy,
some of whose excesses would be curbed under Prop. 111. But
in order to get teacher-union backing for the latest measure,
new money-bones were tossed. All the while, the schools have
gotten more to chew on than poor-mouthing would suggest.
Teacher compensation in the state nearly leads the nation and
an unusually fat layer of administrators oversee
special-grant programs, so it isn't surprising that per-pupil
expenditures are higher than ever in California.
Desegregation expenses, meantime, are $500 million a year --
"anything a judge will sign for," an analyst for the
Legislature says.
   A state lottery is pumping a billion dollars a year into
the classrooms, but it can't be used to build them, and
that's where the pinch is now. Enrollment is expected to
swell by about 200,000 next fall. Lots of the new kids don't
speak English and are otherwise no bundles of joy for the
schools. That's why more money doesn't go as far these days,
it's said.
   The Democrats holding the Legislature are battling Mr.
Deukmejian over the welfare COLAs, first written into law as
part of Gov. Ronald Reagan's relief "reform" act in 1971.
They automatically increase benefit checks, entitle new
recipients and expand programs, regardless of available
revenues and not subject to executive counteraction. The
governor points out that they were included to win opposition
agreement to corresponding changes by Mr. Reagan that were
then struck down by the courts. Welfare costs are the focal
point of a $3.6 billion budget-deficit fight in Sacramento, a
backdrop to Prop. 111.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Deukmejian actually has managed to scrimp
on public health, mental health and care for the disabled,
but the Medicaid pool is nearly dry. Federal policy makers
and judges are requiring hundreds of millions of dollars in
services for refugees and illegal aliens. Immigration is an
economic boon to California, but extension of social benefits
to all comers is a blank check that Gann-tied revenues may
not be able to cover.
   Finally, there is transportation, the supposed aim of
Prop. 111. Real state outlays in this area actually are
higher than in the early '80s. State Finance Director Jesse
Huff says this is because road money banked during Jerry
Brown's reign has been spent. The gas tax, earmarked for this
use, brings in half the effective revenue that it did in
1967, Mr. Huff says.
   A projected $18.5 billion is to be raised over a decade
from the higher gas and related taxes under Prop. 111, the
proceeds going to pavement, traffic engineering and mass
transit. That package itself raises important questions for
closer examination. But the relevance for this discussion is
that those funds won't be counted under the Gann limit. Add
the other changes in Gann and, according to economist Arthur
Laffer, more than $53 billion in incremental spending can
result over 10 years if politicians raise sufficient taxes.
Recall that's now the size of the entire budget.
   Mr. Laffer is a lonely opponent of Prop. 111. Some of his
warnings of dire economic effects seem overdrawn in light of
how California, geographically blessed, has prospered with a
high income tax and other burdens. But it must be remembered
that he was right about the results of Prop. 13, the
property-tax cut that initiated the state's boom. The
establishment that wants Prop. 111 and fought Prop. 13 was
wrong then. Why follow its lead today?
