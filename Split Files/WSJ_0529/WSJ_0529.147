   "Is It Fair," asks Jolie Solomon in her April 20 article,
"to Tailor Perks Just for Women?"
   The answer "Yes]" should be obvious, but the phrasing of
the question tends to muddy the issue by suggesting that men
and women are just two more special-interest groups with
conflicting goals. Men who think this way could become much
wiser by literally pondering their navels.

   Male executives might approach the issue differently if it
were put like this: "Should corporate benefits be structured
in such a fashion that your wife, sister or daughter has
career opportunities that approximate your brother's, your
son's or your own?"
