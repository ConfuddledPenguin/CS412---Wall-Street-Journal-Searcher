   SEATTLE -- Burlington Resources Inc. said its Meridian Oil
Inc. subsidiary agreed to buy the producing properties of
Unicon Producing Co. for $399 million.
   The acquisition covers about 500 billion cubic feet of
proved natural gas or equivalent reserves, nearly all of
which are in the San Juan Basin of northwest New Mexico,
where Meridian has a significant interest. Burlington, an
energy company, said the transaction is its largest energy
acquisition since 1985 and would boost Meridian's total
reserves about 11%. The transaction is subject to several
conditions, including Federal Trade Commission approval.
Burlington said it plans to complete the deal next month.
