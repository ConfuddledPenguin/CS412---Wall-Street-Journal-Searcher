   HONG KONG -- Hard bargaining is about to begin on a new
international framework for governing trade in garments and
textiles.
   For the past four years, negotiators in the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have been
discussing ways to bring trade in garments and textiles under
GATT. The final series of negotiations will begin in Geneva
in July, with a December deadline set for a wholesale
revision of GATT.

   Representatives of the 22-member International Textiles
and Clothing Bureau met in Hong Kong last week to draft the
organization's negotiating stance for the July meeting of
GATT. Formed in 1985, the bureau comprises developing
nations, such as Indonesia and Mexico, and newly
industrialized countries, such as South Korea and Hong Kong.
Its members account for between 50% and 60% of the world's
annual exports of garments and textiles.
   Many contentious trade issues remain for the 96-member
GATT, whose protocols have governed most of world trade since
1948. Among the issues are disputes over agricultural
subsidies, protection of intellectual property and market
access for such services as banking and insurance.
   But trade in garments and textiles may prove to be the
thorniest item on the agenda in the final six months of
bargaining. It also is an issue that sharply divides the
developed countries, particularly the U.S., and the
developing nations. Rather than a so-called North-South
issue, however, many see textiles as a touchstone for the
free-trade system that GATT was formed to uphold.
   "It is important for the Uruguay Round that textile
negotiations succeed," Hassan Kartadjoemena, chairman of last
week's conference of the International Textiles and Clothing
Bureau, told a news conference.
   "For many countries, it is inconceivable to have a
successful round if there is no success in the handling of
textiles," said Mr. Kartadjoemena, who holds the rank of
ambassador as Indonesia's special representative to the
multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva.
   Since 1974, international trade in garments and textiles
has been governed by the Multi-Fiber Arrangement. The MFA,
which expires in July 1991, exists separately from GATT
because GATT doesn't allow quantitative restrictions on
trade.
   The MFA allows nations to restrict imports of garments and
textiles through bilateral agreements between the importing
and exporting countries. The agreements aim to set import
quotas that provide reasonable protection for manufacturers
in the importing nations while still allowing for growth in
trade.
   For the most part, industrialized nations argue that the
MFA quota system is needed to protect their manufacturers
from inexpensive imports produced by low-wage, developing
nations. The developing countries argue that the quotas
restrict their ability to sell abroad, thus crimping economic
growth.
   Most GATT members favor phasing out the MFA and its quota
system, eventually governing trade in garments and textiles
under the same rules as trade in other goods. However, there
is wide disagreement on the phase-out process among those
nations that have stated positions -- and both the U.S. and
Canada have proposed new "global quota" systems for the
interim period.
   The U.S., the largest market for many of the textile
bureau's members, has proposed integrating the MFA into GATT
after a 10-year transition period to begin in January 1992.
But during the transition, there would be a new global quota
system and tariff rate. The global quotas would have both
specific country allocations covering current bilateral
agreements and a "global basket" that would expand to provide
growth. Each year, the specific country quotas would shrink
while the basket would expand.
   Critics of the global-quotas proposals argue that a
progressive phase-out of the existing MFA would be less
disruptive than the institution of any new system. They also
say the global quotas threaten to be tighter than existing
ones.
