   A federal appeals court ruled that Fleet Factors Corp., a
commercial financing company, may be liable for the cleanup
of hazardous waste at a site owned by a company to which it
lent money.
   The decision, reached late last week in Atlanta, could
have far-reaching significance for financial institutions
that lend money to companies that own or operate property
contaminated with hazardous substances.

   The case had been closely watched because it is the first
time an appeals court has ruled on the scope of an exemption
in the federal Superfund law that shields lenders from
liability when they have a security interest in a company but
don't participate in its management. Under Superfund, those
who own or operate contaminated sites are responsible for
cleaning them up.
   The majority of courts have ruled that lenders who
foreclose on contaminated property are no longer covered by
that exemption. But Fleet, a New York-based subsidiary of
Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. of Providence, R.I.,
didn't foreclose on a facility owned by defunct Swainsboro
Print Works in Swainsboro, Ga. Fleet had loaned money to
Swainsboro secured by that company's accounts receivable and
inventory.
   The government sued Fleet in 1987 to recover the cost of
cleaning up hazardous waste at the site. In 1982, after
Swainsboro Print filed for bankruptcy-court protection, Fleet
arranged to auction off the company's inventory and equipment
to recoup its security interest. According to the government,
during the winding down process asbestos was released and
drums containing hazardous waste spilled on the property.
Fleet has said it is not liable for the cleanup because it
did not own or operate the site and that Fleet's actions were
covered by the exemption.
   In its decision, the appeals panel said that lenders who
are able to affect hazardous waste disposal decisions at a
site are liable under Superfund. The panel found that the
lower court had erred when it ruled that lenders must be
involved in the day-to-day operations of a facility to incur
liability.
   The panel said that lenders must insist that debtors
comply with environmental standards as a requirement for
continued and future financial support.
   "Banks will now have to assert a greater degree of
diligence over their borrowers and their borrowers'
activities with hazardous waste than had previously been
thought necessary," said Richard G. Leland of the New York
law firm of Rosenman &amp; Colin, who argued the lower court case
on behalf of Fleet.
   But Richard B. Stewart, assistant attorney general for
environment and natural resources, said that while the
court's ruling was broad, "we're dealing with a case where
there was very active involvement by the creditor in the
day-to-day management."
   Richard Miley of Nixon, Yow, Waller &amp; Capers, a lawyer for
Fleet, said the company hadn't decided whether it will
appeal.

   PHILIP MORRIS SUES INSURER over Panama factory destroyed
in wake of U.S. invasion.
   In its suit, Philip Morris International, a unit of Philip
Morris Cos., New York, claimed that Cigna Property &amp; Casualty
Insurance Co. breached an insurance agreement by refusing to
pay for theft and destruction at the cigarette factory. The
suit seeks damages of at least $2 million. According to the
suit, the damages and looting occurred Dec. 22, two days
after the U.S. invaded Panama to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Cigna, a unit of Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp.,
countersued, arguing that its coverage excludes damages that
occur during "hostile or warlike action . . . by military,
naval or air forces." The company said it doesn't have to pay
because damages to the cigarette factory, in an industrial
park in Panama City, happened during hostilities. Both suits
were filed in federal court in Manhattan.
   A Cigna spokesman said the company doesn't comment on
suits.
   A Philip Morris spokeswoman said the company maintains
that the damage occurred during "looting by civilians,
following the military invasion."
   The spokeswoman said the $2 million in damages included
destruction of the factory as well as the theft of tobacco
and liquor at the facility.

   SATELLITE-TECHNOLOGY MAKERS WIN jury verdict dismissing
negligence suit.
   Officials in the aerospace industry had been closely
watching the California case, believed to be the first trial
of property damage claims arising from an incident in outer
space. Many were concerned that a damage verdict might
encourage a wave of suits second-guessing the design of
satellite products that are on the cutting-edge of
technology, says Victoria Cloninger, an attorney in the Los
Angeles office of Lord, Bissell &amp; Brook, counsel for Hitco, a
defendant.
   "This isn't the average toaster that you buy off the
shelf," Ms. Cloninger says. "Everybody was sitting on pins
and needles."
   The case involves the failure of a telecommunications
satellite built for the Indonesian government and launched
from the U.S. space shuttle in 1984. Shortly after the
launch, the satellite malfunctioned, falling short of its
proper orbit. In January 1986, a products liability suit was
brought by three insurance companies to recover $5.6 million
which they paid to Perumtel, the Indonesian government's
telecommunications agency.
   Accused of negligent product design were McDonnell Douglas
Corp., St. Louis, which made the launch vehicle; Morton
Thiokol Inc., now Thiokol Corp., Ogden, Utah, which built the
rocket motor; and Hitco, which fabricated the so-called exit
cone that is used to maximize the rocket's thrust. Hitco is a
subsidiary of B-P Chemicals Advanced Materials, Gardenia,
Calif.
   After a five-month trial, a state court jury in Fullerton,
Calif., held on May 15 that none of the defendants had been
negligent. The jury did uphold a breach of warranty claim
against Morton Thiokol, but, following the trial judge's
instructions, awarded damages of only $52,000, including
interest.
   The plaintiffs were Lexington Insurance Co., Boston;
Talbot, Bird &amp; Co., New York, and Northbrook Excess Insurance
Co., Chicago.
   Phillip Bostwick, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., law
firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge, counsel for the
plaintiffs, said an appeal is being considered.

   RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI IS SWITCHING New York law firms.
   The former Manhattan U.S. attorney is moving from White &amp;
Case to Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinsky, a smaller law firm
that has attracted many former Manhattan prosecutors.
   Mr. Giuliani, 45 years old, said the move was "an exciting
opportunity to join some of my old friends." He joined White
&amp; Case in February 1989 and failed in his bid to be mayor of
New York last November. He called Anderson Kill a firm with a
"dynamic atmosphere" and more opportunities to practice
litigation.
   Mr. Giuliani is known for his prosecution of New York's
mob "families" and white-collar criminals.
   Dennison Young Jr., Mr. Giuliani's deputy U.S. attorney
who went with him to White &amp; Case, also will move to Anderson
Kill.
   At White &amp; Case, Mr. Giuliani was making more than
$600,000 a year and Mr. Young, more than $300,000 a year,
said individuals knowledgeable about the situation. At
Anderson Kill, the two will be making less, said the
individuals. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Young declined to comment
on their compensation. White &amp; Case's managing partner could
not be reached for comment.
   In recent months, there has been much speculation that Mr.
Giuliani, rumored to be restless, would leave 365-lawyer
White &amp; Case, which specializes in banking, insurance and
international law. Mr. Giuliani wouldn't comment on his
political aspirations.
   Said Mr. Giuliani, "I remain interested in public issues.
We'll see what opportunities are out there later."

   NORIEGA'S ATTORNEYS resume their battle to get paid.
   Attorneys for the deposed Panamanian leader are scheduled
to appear in federal court in Miami today to ask Judge
William M. Hoeveler to clear the way for their fees to be
paid by the U.S. government.
   In late April, Mr. Noriega's defense team, led by Frank
Rubino, asked the court to be allowed to withdraw from the
drug-racketeering case. They complained that the U.S. had
stopped the flow of their fees by freezing Mr. Noriega's
assets.
   Last week, federal prosecutors said the government would
agree to pay the bills under a provision of the Criminal
Justice Act. The act sets a limit of $75 an hour for legal
fees. But the U.S. attorney's office and Mr. Noriega's
attorneys had hoped that a provision in the act concerning
"complex" cases would allow the court to award full
commercial fees of about $350 an hour. Mr. Noriega agreed to
sign an affidavit saying he would reimburse the government if
and when his assets are unfrozen.
   Last Thursday, however, Judge Hoeveler indicated that the
Criminal Justice Act doesn't allow him to break the
$75-an-hour barrier, and the agreement to pay the defense
team collapsed.
   Today, according to David Lewis, one of Mr. Noriega's
attorneys, the defense team will file a motion asking the
court to declare the act unconstitutional as it applies to
Mr. Noriega's case because of its size and complexity.
Failing that, Judge Hoeveler will hold hearings to determine
which of Mr. Noriega's assets could be unfrozen to pay his
attorneys.
   Mr. Noriega's attorneys have alleged that he was paid at
least $11 million by the U.S. and between $6 million and $7
million by foreign governments in his position as head of the
Panamanian Defense Force. Those funds, the defense maintains,
shouldn't have to be forfeited.
   The cost of Mr. Noriega's defense, they add, will total at
least $5 million.

   DREXEL MAY HAVE TO PAY LEGAL FEES of securities-fraud
defendant, judge says.
   Federal Judge Charles Haight said that Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. may be forced to pay more than $600,000 in legal
fees to Morvillo, Abramowitz &amp; Grand, which represented Ross
Frankel, a former Drexel employee convicted of securities
fraud, conspiracy, and other charges last month.
   Morvillo Abramowitz has been trying to collect fees from
Mr. Frankel. The law firm had tried to withhold case files
Mr. Frankel needs to appeal his conviction. Judge Haight
ordered the law firm to release the files to Bernstein &amp;
Milner earlier this month.
   A spokesman for Drexel said that after Mr. Frankel's
conviction the company stopped paying his legal bills because
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, the brokerage's parent, had
filed for bankruptcy court protection. "The company is under
no obligation to fund anybody's fees who's been convicted of
a crime," the spokesman said.
   Mr. Frankel, who directed arbitrage research at Drexel,
was implicated in the 1986 "Yuppie Five" case, in which five
young Wall Street professionals were charged with insider
trading.
   In an opinion late last week, Judge Haight said that
because Drexel paid Mr. Frankel's bills until the time of the
Chapter 11 filing, it may still be liable for the expenses.
Judge Haight has also asked the parties to submit briefs on
the fee issue.
   Mr. Frankel had signed an agreement with his former
lawyers that he would pay his legal fees but his new lawyer,
Michael Milner, of the New York law firm of Bernstein &amp;
Milner, argues the agreement applies only to pretrial
representation. According to Mr. Milner, Drexel had said in
writing it would pay Mr. Frankel's fees.
   Paul Grand of Morvillo Abramowitz, who represented Mr.
Frankel in the trial, wouldn't comment on the fee dispute.
   According to the judge's opinion, the only fees paid by
Drexel for Mr. Frankel's defense went to Mr. Grand's former
law firm, Grand &amp; Ostrow, which merged with Obermaier &amp;
Morvillo last year. Obermaier &amp; Morvillo represented Mr.
Frankel's co-defendant, Victor Teichner and his securities
firm, Victor Teichner &amp; Co.
