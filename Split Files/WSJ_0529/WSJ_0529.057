   Something is very wrong with the governors' races in New
York and Massachusetts. In New York, the last-minute choice
of Republican bosses is an economist who isn't even
registered in the party. In Massachusetts, the leading
candidate for the Democratic nomination may not even be
allowed on the primary ballot.
   New York's Governor Mario Cuomo is following the path of
Michael Dukakis as he raises every tax in sight in a futile
attempt to close a yawning deficit. You'd think Republicans
would seize the opportunity to force a real debate on the
state's future. Wrong. A total of 16 people have declined to
run.

   Last week party bosses refused to accept New York
University Dean Herbert London, a Republican who is already
the choice of the Conservative Party, as their own nominee.
Instead, in a flurry of late-night meetings they anointed
economist Pierre Rinfret as their man. Mr. Rinfret will
likely be ratified at the GOP state convention that opens
today.
   Like Mr. Rinfret, Mr. London has little campaign
experience. But he is aggressively challenging the
spendthrift Cuomo record. Mr. London wants the New York
Republican Party to finally cut free of its Rockefeller roots
and embrace privatization, tax cuts and a real effort at
crime control.
   But GOP leaders have as their main focus protecting their
only patronage rice bowl -- control of the State Senate.
Instead of Mr. London, they prefer the more subdued and
liberal Mr. Rinfret, whom many GOP leaders admitted they had
never met. Since he is a registered independent, the GOP
executive committee will have to grant him a special waiver
to run. Unless Mr. London wins votes from 20% of the bosses'
hand-picked delegates at the state convention, Mr. Rinfret
will be unopposed on the GOP primary ballot.
   In Massachusetts, Democratic bosses are also trying to use
an archaic exclusionary rule to keep a viable candidate off
the ballot.
   John Silber, the neoconservative president of Boston
University, is now the leading candidate for the Democratic
nomination for governor. A Boston Herald poll gives him 28%,
Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy 23% and Attorney General Frank Belotti
19%. However, no candidate can appear on the September
primary ballot unless he or she first wins 15% or more of the
votes cast at a state convention next month. Many party
delegates are teachers' union members who despise the fiery
Mr. Silber. He gets only 8% support in a delegate poll, while
Mr. Belotti is first with 33%. Mr. Silber could still win
enough sympathy votes to push him over 15%, but delegates
strongly oppose lifting the rule. The Boston Herald claims
"they would rather deny 700,000 primary voters a real
choice."
   The days when party bosses could pick a candidate behind
the scenes and force party members to accept the choice have
ended in most states. New York and Massachusetts still retain
anti-democratic methods for selecting candidates. In theory,
state conventions are held to exclude fringe candidates. In
practice, they are often an anti-democratic device to allow
an entrenched party faction to retain power.
   As the entire world seems to embrace open political
processes, it's time to clear away some of the obstacles to
effective democracy in this country. Exclusionary rules such
as those in New York and Massachusetts only perpetuate the
control of party bosses, block new ideas and faces from
entering the public debate and increase the level of voter
cynicism and nonparticipation in elections.
