   NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Iran will direct $5 billion in currency
credits to its oil industry this year, an amount
unprecedented in the country's history, Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Friday, according to Tehran Radio
monitored here.
   The credits comprise about 6% of the country's $80 billion
budget for the current Iranian year, which began March 21.

   The massive investments underline Iran's commitment to
rebuild and update its oil industry, which was badly battered
in the eight-year war with Iraq.
   Oil and gas-related industries, which earn more than 90%
of Iran's foreign exchange, were deprived of funds for
maintenance and development as funds were channeled to the
war effort.
   But Tehran began rebuilding immediately after the United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted the conflict on Aug. 20,
1988.
   Inaugurating a methanol plant in the southern Iranian
province of Shiraz Friday, Mr. Aqazadeh said Iran's current
sustainable production capacity is 3.3 million barrels a day.
Mr. Aqazadeh said it will be boosted to 3.7 million barrels a
day in four months time and four million barrels a day next
year.
