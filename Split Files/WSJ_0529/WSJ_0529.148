   U.S. retailers and apparel makers, looking for new markets
to conquer, are eager to cash in on the consumer boom in
Japan. But they're quickly discovering how hard it is to set
up shop there.
   Dozens of American apparel makers and retailers -- from
one-man shops to giants such as Hartmarx Corp. -- have moved
into Japan. Apparel maker Polo/Ralph Lauren Corp. and toy
retailer Toys "R" Us Inc. have opened stores there or made
plans to do so in the near future. Hartmarx, the big menswear
company, already earns half of its licensing royalties from
Japan, while Tiffany &amp; Co.'s sales in Japan, by far the
retailer's biggest foreign market, totaled more than $60
million in the latest fiscal year.

   With demand in many other countries sluggish, and many
U.S. department store chains unsettled, the Japanese market
seems more appealing than ever. The Japanese spend an
estimated 15% to 20% more on clothes per person than
Americans do, and European and American brands such as
Chanel, Giorgio Armani and Donna Karan have become the rage
there -- a result of the strong yen and wide travel by the
Japanese in the late 1980s.
   The foreign-label cachet isn't limited to apparel. A
growing number of affluent Japanese housewives are chopping
vegetables with food processors bought at Williams-Sonoma
Inc. boutiques, which have been open in the Tokyu department
store chain for the past two years. And more suburban
homeowners are sleeping on beds from Drexel Heritage
Furnishings Co., which has a fast-growing presence in Japan
through a joint venture with the Daimaru Inc. store chain.
   But American retailers venturing into Japan often have to
learn some hard lessons about conducting business in another
culture. Middlemen there exert much control over retailing.
Real-estate costs are astronomical. Local customs and laws
sometimes thwart the best-laid business plans. Though
partnerships can greatly ease an American company's entry
into Japan, they can later become a brake on growth.
   "The moment you go in there pompous, assuming the cachet
of American brands is enough, you will be in store for some
unhappy surprises," says David Rosenzweig, president of the
fashion group of Bidermann Industries Corp., which markets
Bill Robinson-label menswear in Japan. "We are used to
approaching business like a Polaroid {camera}, while they
treat it as a 35 millimeter."
   The easiest way to gain entry to the Japanese market is
through an alliance, usually a licensing agreement, with a
Japanese partner. One early entrant to Japan was Polo/Ralph
Lauren, which teamed up with Seibu Department Stores Ltd.,
part of Saison Group, in 1976. Polo/Ralph Lauren says the
14-store partnership has been very successful, and a separate
Ralph Lauren company was formed two years ago in Japan for
the purpose of opening free-standing boutiques selling
household linens as well as clothes. "We want to market to
the mass market at department stores while targeting the
high-income customers at the boutiques," says Tomoyuki
Asaoka, an executive at Seibu, which is also financing the
new company.
   Peter Strom, president of Polo/Ralph Lauren, says the
company decided to enter Japan through a licensing alliance
because "you don't have to put up your own money, and the
{licensee} knows the etiquette of the business better than
you do."
   But licensing arrangements have drawbacks. One problem is
that a company loses a lot of control over how its
merchandise is displayed and sold. As a result, disparate
items often get jumbled together. Near the main-floor
entrance at the fancy Mitsukoshi store in Tokyo's Ginza
district, for example, high fashion is displayed next to
ordinary goods, with $1,500 Christian Lacroix ensembles sold
adjacent to towering shelves of $200 Coach handbags.
   Bidermann officials say they were shocked by a Bill
Robinson display at Seibu, which initially provided an
exaggerated setting for the designer's sophisticated,
glamorous look. "They decorated the department like a movie
set with Hollywood posters and movie cameras," says Maria
DeLuca, a Bidermann senior vice president of marketing. "It
was all wrong." She said Bidermann should have better
explained what kind of tone it wanted to set.
   For successful brands, licensing agreements can quickly
become a hindrance to expansion. Japan's traditional retail
chains, such as Seibu and Mitsukoshi, are big players on the
licensing front because they have locked up Japan's prime
real-estate locations, often situated above main subway
arteries. But because most Japanese department-store chains
have fewer than 30 stores, American companies can be severely
limited in their growth. "Western apparel companies that own
and license brands successfully in Japan probably regret that
they didn't invest in their own subsidiaries five or 10 years
ago," says Robert Frazier, a managing director in New York
with Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting company.
   Trying to gain a foothold without a licensing deal,
however, can pose formidable problems of its own. Toys "R"
Us, which had its eye on Japan for years, was stymied by
Japanese law. Under longstanding provisions, small shops
could force retailers to scale back plans to open big stores
in their neighborhoods, and to delay the plans for several
years. The restrictions threatened to delay Toys "R" Us's
plans for a 46,000-square-foot store in northern Japan.
   But Japanese regulators are moving to ease the
restrictions, under pressure from the U.S. In what many other
U.S. retailers see as a test case of the change, Toys "R" Us
now plans to open four to six stores in Japan beginning next
year. It's too early to tell how much easier it will be for
large stores to open, but analysts say local merchants will
continue to exert strong pressure, even without legal
leverage. Indeed, Toys "R" Us faces opposition from a newly
formed organization of owners of local toy boutiques.
   Whether going solo or in an alliance, U.S. retailers face
other obstacles in Japan. A complication not present in the
U.S. is the middleman, an extra player between the wholesaler
and retailer who stocks merchandise from various
manufacturers and delivers it quickly when stores call for
it. This practice persists partly because stores don't have
warehouse or storage space to keep goods in stock. But it
means added costs for manufacturers, who pay for shipping and
other expenses.
   In this system, goods are considered to be sold on
consignment, and manufacturers are required to take back
merchandise that doesn't sell, a practice unheard of in the
U.S. outside the publishing industry. "In America, you can't
imagine a store returning something that it has bought
already," says Masafumi Ohki, managing director of Levi
Strauss &amp; Co.'s Japanese subsidiary. Mr. Ohki says he had a
hard time talking his American parent company into paying the
extra costs of working with a broker.
   Japanese stores' rigid quality control can be a stumbling
block for even the most prestigious imported brands. Japanese
consumers scrutinize buttonholes and inner seams as closely
as they do labels. "They have been brought up to be much more
observant than Americans when it comes to stitching and eye
for detail," says Clifford Grodd, president of Paul Stuart, a
U.S. apparel retailer that has three stores in Japan.
   According to Renown Inc., Japan's biggest apparel maker,
up to 30% of imported designer apparel doesn't meet Japanese
standards. Japanese apparel marketers often restitch seams
before distributing items to Japanese stores, where they're
inspected again by store employees.
   Like other big chains, Seibu stores maintain
quality-control departments where workers inspect all
garments for workmanship, colorfastness and other properties
before they are placed on the sales floor. Seibu says these
checks add as much as 15% to the cost of a garment.
   Another retailing practice also frustrates some apparel
makers. Japanese department stores tend to carry many more
brands than their U.S. counterparts, but in much smaller
quantities, says Nobu Asano, a New York broker for U.S.
clothing companies that export to Japan. This practice
prevents any one clothing line from getting a big order from
any one chain, he says, and means it can take years for a
brand to develop a following.
   Any company trying to do business in Japan has to cope
with the high cost of real estate. Monthly rent for retail
space in the Ginza district can exceed 18,000 yen ($120) a
square foot, five or six times the level on New York's
Madison Avenue. Moreover, landlords often request deposits of
up to four years of rent. "That tends to be the biggest
hurdle," says William Best, vice president of consulting
company A.T. Kearney International Inc.
   The high cost of real estate has caused Sharper Image
Corp., which sells high-tech and upscale gadgets, to slow its
expansion in Japan. The company has opened six free-standing
stores in Japan since 1988 and had planned to open more than
10 such stores in its first three years there. But now, to
control its real-estate costs, Sharper Image plans to begin
opening stores within department stores. With free-standing
stores, "we need extremely high sales just to break even,"
says Masaru Tanaka, who manages the Sharper Image's venture
in Tokyo.
   Cost isn't always the only hurdle in real estate, as
Talbots Inc., a subsidiary of Japan's Aeon Group, found
recently. Before it opened its first store in Tokyo in
February, the prospective landlord wanted to acquaint himself
with the U.S. store, even though its parent company is
well-known in Japan.
   So, says Arnold Zechter, president of Talbots, "I had to
have tea with the owner of the building to see if he liked
me."
