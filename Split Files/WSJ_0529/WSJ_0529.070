   WARNING FOR EUROPE'S AIRLINES

   Sir Leon Brittan, European Community commissioner for
competition, warned airlines not to try dodging competition
in a single European market through anti-competitive mergers
and alliances.
   The EC's goal for airlines under its 1992 single-market
plan "is to eliminate altogether the restrictive agreements
and abuses of joint dominance which persist," Sir Leon said,
adding that the EC would "replace these with the conditions
needed for genuine competition."
   But, he said, some airlines have already taken steps to
dodge competition by buying or linking up with would-be
competitors. He then cited Air France's purchase of French
airline Air Inter, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' buy-out of
Transavia. "We are also concerned about the trend toward
Europeanwide networks and the possibility of so-called
nonaggression pacts between airlines," Sir Leon said, noting
link-ups among Air France, Lufthansa and Iberia and among
Sabena, KLM, and British Airways.
   If these arrangements are found to violate EC rules, the
EC Commission can order that they be dismantled or altered to
conform to the bloc's competition laws.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE GRAFT CASE
                                                                                                       

   The Philippine government filed a graft case against a
business ally of the late President Ferdinand Marcos for
allegedly helping Mr. Marcos grab control of the country's
largest newspaper chain, an official said. A government
commission that investigates cases of ill-gotten wealth among
Marcos allies filed charges in the anti-graft court against
Eduardo Cojuangco, an estranged cousin of President Corazon
Aquino. Mateo Caparas, head of the presidential commission on
good government, alleged Mr. Cojuangco served as a proxy for
Mr. Marcos in running the Manila Bulletin chain.
                                                                                                       

   A BULGARIAN CLUB MED
                                                                                                       

   Club Mediterranee S.A. reached an accord with the
government of Bulgaria under which the French company will
transform a Black Sea resort formerly reserved for Communist
Party officials into one of Club Med's trademark "villages."
A Club Med official said a contract will be signed with
Bulgarian Tourism Minister Stoyan Zhulev in the next few
days. The 600-bed resort, situated 10 miles from the town of
Varna on the Black Sea, is scheduled to open in 1991.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS RAIL PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   The Swiss government gave its approval for plans for a
10.1-billion-franc ($7.09 billion) rail project through the
Alps. The executive Federal Council suggested that
Switzerland should tap the capital markets for three-quarters
of the cost. The rest would come from a fund made up of fees
on oil products. The project is subject to approval by
Parliament.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIA WIDENS SMOKING BAN
                                                                                                       

   Australia said it would ban smoking aboard international
flights traveling within its borders. Acting Prime Minister
Paul Keating told a conference of the Australian Medical
Association that from Sept. 1 smoking wouldn't be permitted
on international carriers flying between Australian cities.
Smoking has been banned on Australian domestic flights since
December 1987, but international carriers have so far been
exempt.
                                                                                                       

   NEW VENTURE IN VIETNAM
                                                                                                       

   Vietnam and South Korea have agreed to establish a
joint-venture company in Ho Chi Minh City to produce
cigarettes, the Korea Tobacco &amp; Ginseng Corp. announced.
Corporation officials said that agreement was reached last
week when Hong Do Kyun, head of the Korean corporation,
visited Vietnam's state-run tobacco plant. Mr. Hong agreed to
transfer technology, equipment, raw material and technicians,
they said.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN: LARGEST CREDITOR NATION
                                                                                                       

   Japan had record net overseas assets of $293.2 billion
last year, making it the world's largest creditor nation for
the fifth straight year, the Finance Ministry said.
   The figure was up 0.5% from 1988, according to an annual
report presented by Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to the
cabinet. The 0.5% increase, which followed a 21.1% jump in
1988, was the lowest rise since 1982, when Japan began
posting a yearly increase in its external assets, ministry
officials said.
   The officials attributed the slower growth to such factors
as a drop in Japan's current-account surplus in 1989 and an
increase in appraised profits in Japanese stocks held by
overseas investors.
   Japan's governmental and private assets abroad at the end
of 1989 totaled $1.771 trillion, up 20.5% from a year
earlier, while liabilities rose 25.5% to $1.475 trillion, the
report said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Thieves stole 66,000 gallons of kerosene valued at $36,000
from a storage tank at the closely guarded U.S. Embassy in
Tokyo. . . . A Brazilian court ruled that the tiny Green
Party, which campaigned to save the Amazon rain forest, must
disband because it hadn't met legal obligations such as being
represented in nine states. "From now on, Brazil enters the
restricted club of countries like Albania and China, which
don't have ecological parties," said a party leader.
