   Worthen Banking Corp., Little Rock, Ark., said a federal
appeals court refused a last-ditch effort by Arkansas banking
regulators to halt the bank-holding company's planned
purchase of an insolvent thrift from the Resolution Trust
Corp.
   The ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis upheld an earlier decision by a three-member panel of
the court that the RTC has the power to override state
banking laws to sell insolvent thrifts and their branches to
banks.

   The Arkansas banking commissioner had requested the full
court to stay the decision, which reversed an opinion by a
district court judge. Worthen said it is working with the RTC
to coordinate a closing of its purchase of certain assets and
liabilities of Independence Federal Bank FSB of Batesville,
Ark.
   Arkansas banking officials couldn't be reached for
comment.
