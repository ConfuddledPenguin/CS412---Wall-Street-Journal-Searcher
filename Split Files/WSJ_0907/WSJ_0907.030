   "Financial Loss: Big Banks Are Plagued by a Gradual
Erosion of Key Profit Centers" (page one, Aug. 1) considers a
sad story about the dismal profit prospects in the banking
industry. It omits one critical fact that we all take for
granted, and one issue that can serve to alter future
performance.
   The fact is that we simply have too many banks with
enormous redundancies. With more than 13,000 banks performing
functions that could be accomplished by fewer than 100 across
the country, expense rationalization is a necessity for
having this industry earn reasonable rates of return. The
regulatory process simply must permit combinations that serve
both the customer and the bank shareholder.
