   LEIPZIG, East Germany -- From the outside, it looks like
business as usual at the huge Soviet pavilion at the Leipzig
Trade Fair. A towering bust of Lenin glares from its pedestal
at the main entrance; above, a gold spire topped with a red
star reaches into the gray September sky.
   Inside, however, it's clear that something is terribly
wrong.

   The Soviet pavilion this year seems strangely empty --
even by East bloc standards. At last year's autumn fair, 300
companies were represented here; only 35 made it this time
around. The displays include color televisions from Lvov,
refrigerators from Minsk, and washing machines from a
converted missile factory in Votkinsk. But only a trickle of
onlookers wander through the building, and most of the
pavilion is closed off and dark.
   Part of the reason for the declining Soviet profile is
practical: The Soviets can no longer afford to come to
Leipzig in full force, since hotels and other costs are now
calculated in German marks. The problem reaches deeper,
however.
   Until last year's democratic upheaval in Eastern Europe,
Moscow used Leipzig's East-West trade fair as a place to
parade the best and brightest of Soviet industry, a practice
that once included erecting an elaborate display of a
Sputnik. Never mind that little of what was on show was
actually for sale; this was Cold War politics of the highest
order.
   Now, with the two Germanys hurtling toward full
unification in less than a month, the rules of the game
suddenly have shifted. While politicians from both sides of
the German border talk extensively about the need to maintain
East Germany's historic trade links with the Soviets, the
evidence in Leipzig seems to suggest that the connection
already is wearing thin.
   "We're certainly not happy with the situation at this
fair," complains Wolfram Kapzow, a Soviet trade
representative who has attended 20 Leipzig fairs since 1965.
   Mr. Kapzow's office, tucked in one corner of the Soviet
pavilion, is one of the few places that still seems fully
occupied. A steady stream of stern-faced German businessmen
shuffle through the Soviet official's outer office as he
works on renegotiating more than 200 bilateral trade
contracts with the East Germans. The contracts are set to
expire at the end of this year; after that, all calculations
will be in German marks. Later this week, officials from the
Soviet Union will meet here with representatives from both
Germanys to discuss the problem.
   As for the fair itself, the Soviets seem reconciled to
drastic change. They even have encouraged some of the decline
in Soviet participation by restricting displays to companies
that have products ready to be sold abroad.
   Out on the display floor the Soviets are trying to make
the best of the situation. Sergey Mashinnikov, a spokesman
for Votkinsky Zavod, a factory that once produced SS-20
missiles, is showing off his latest line of consumer products
-- a baby buggy made from bright pink fake leather and a
plastic washing machine that a company pamphlet describes as
a "true enchantress."
   "As you can see, we're doing our best to produce new
products to meet our new situation," says Mr. Mashinnikov.
"But making the transition isn't easy."
   Down the aisle from Mr. Mashinnikov's baby buggies, a tank
factory from Ishewsk displays a candy-apple red Ish-Planeta-5
motorcycle. Like the missile factory, the tank-cum-motorcycle
maker already was making consumer goods, but only as a side
line.
   The problems facing the Soviets could mean this is the
last time such offerings can all be viewed under one roof.
Soviet officials say they intend to keep the pavilion -- a
1950s-era concoction that looks like a giant wedding cake --
but they're not quite sure what they'll do with it.
   "It's our property, but we may decide to turn it into a
hall where we can rent space to others," says Mr. Kapzow, the
trade representative. Beginning next spring, the Soviets plan
to spread their concerns out into the buildings devoted to
particular industries, as most other countries long have
done. The pavilion then could be renovated or even demolished
and rebuilt from scratch.
   "Until now, this was all political, of course," says Mr.
Kapzow. "We had our building with a red star up above and a
bust of Lenin out front, but now we've got to learn to
operate on a commercial basis."
