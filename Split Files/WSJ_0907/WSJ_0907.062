   MONTERREY -- The reorientation to market policies in the
Mexican economy appears to be a successful reform for Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In the political arena,
however, no such major reorientation or reform has yet taken
place, unless . . . internal changes initiated by Mexico's
ruling party at a conference held this week start a new
political era -- one more in tune with Mexico's liberalized
economy.
   The XIV National Assembly of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) was concluded on Monday. Five
important changes were made to internal party processes. If
taken seriously, they could improve the party's chances for
creating -- and then surviving -- a political opening.

   Perhaps foremost in importance is a move to substitute the
traditional handpicked candidate-selection process for a more
democratic one; the election of candidates through direct
voting for local party heads, local congressmen, mayors and
even "some" governors. Because being appointed a PRI
candidate was the sure way of holding office, the internal
selection of PRI candidates has been more important than the
electoral process itself; election-day votes could be won or
fabricated, but the candidacy only could be chosen by
appointment.
   In the past two decades, the selection of PRI candidates
gradually was centralized to Mexico City until it became the
favorite way to repay high-echelon capital city bureaucrats
for their services. It also was the only way to an elected
political position in a particular province. Anyone serving
in the capital city who had the remotest personal or family
ties to a provincial city or state automatically became that
city's political candidate, even if he was unknown to the
voters in the area.
   This created rancor among local voters and homegrown
politicians (those in the opposition as well as local members
of the PRI), who were left in the observer's role. They
simply awaited the news from Mexico City as to whom would be
elected candidate for the PRI and therefore become the next
mayor, governor or senator.
   As just one example, PRI loyalist Pedro Zorrilla became
governor of Nuevo Leon in 1973 after being away from the
state for 23 years. He never participated in a single
election and quickly faded from the state scene once his
appointed governorship was over.
   This centralist method of choosing candidates has led
citizens to the conclusion that they are not well
represented. Voter disenchantment has led to apathy, which,
in turn, has resulted in high voter abstentionism. On
occasion, that abstentionism has reached levels of 85%, as in
last month's elections in provincial cities such as San Luis
Potosi.
   Another important change at the PRI assembly has to do
with allowing individual affiliation to the party without
having to affiliate through "sectors." The dinosaurs -- as
the old party and union bosses affectionately are known --
had organized the PRI in the form of the "worker," "peasant"
and "popular" sectors; if you wanted to be in politics, you
had to affiliate yourself officially with one of these
sectors. That meant joining the PRI union affiliated with
that sector and effectively bestowing power on the leaders of
that sector. Only in May of this year, the PRI came out with
the results of its first census of affiliates. Statistics in
hand, Secretary General Luis Donaldo Colossio proclaimed the
PRI as the world's largest political party.
   But with a claimed membership of 13 million, 35% of the
qualified Mexican voters, one wonders why even competent
candidates such as President Salinas in 1988 had difficulties
at the ballot box. Ever since the President's close election,
much soul-searching and brainstorming has taken place. One of
the conclusions at the assembly is that forced affiliation is
not a very effective way to get favorable ballots, hence the
move to voluntary affiliation.
   Another interesting change was to eliminate the position
of "delegado", a centrally imposed state chief. Every couple
of years a new delegate was sent from Mexico City to each of
the 31 states. This delegado was the de facto local chief and
the conduit for instructions to and from Mexico City. In the
great majority of cases the delegados did not know the people
and the issues in each community; many of them spent a few
nights a week in local hotels, returned home to the capital
and viewed their jobs as a steppingstone to other jobs. The
idea now is to allow each state to elect its own officials
and design its own political action plan in order to allow
the PRI to be more territorially oriented, more responsive to
local needs.
   Yet another interesting element was the disappearance of
IEPES, the party's political and intellectual arm for central
planning. The declaration of principles also was amended to
include careful wording about the fostering of private-sector
participation for a competitive economy. A
better-late-than-never amendment, now that the government has
been headed in that direction for the past two years.
   When the assembly was announced, different schools of
thought became evident once again: the "corriente critica",
risk-takers who thought that there should be a planned
abandonment of the PRI (the more radical of whom called for a
complete break with the past); the reformists, who called for
a gradual restructuring and internal democratization; and the
old dinosaurs, who viewed the young political class of Mexico
as incapable of successfully abandoning or restructuring the
party and wanted simply to preserve old methods with, of
course, the accompanying privileges.
   With the impetus from economic success behind the current
regime's liberalization process, the tide now seems to be
going in the direction of controlled reform -- far enough to
create expectation, close enough to preserve control.
   Of course, as is usual in these events, the assembly was
full of rhetoric and hard-to-read statements in more than 500
speeches. Thus it is difficult to predict whether these
changes will come about quickly. Mexico has a history of
implementing change in asymmetrical ways. It is parsimonious
and slow in changing when that involves lessening the power
of the central bureaucracy. And it is quick to act when the
need is to grow in the direction of control.
   Whatever pace political change takes in Mexico, there will
be a couple of interesting benchmarks along the way:
elections this fall in the states of Sonora and Nuevo Leon,
home states for PRI head Colossio and President Salinas,
respectively. If Mexico's road to democracy does indeed start
with the PRI itself, these would be the ideal times and
places to start.
