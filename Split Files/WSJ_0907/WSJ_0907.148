   The nation's big retailers reported modest sales gains for
August, but disappointing sales on home furnishings and early
fall merchandise foreshadow a difficult fall and winter
season, analysts agreed.
   The August gains at stores open for at least a year ranged
from 1.6% to 14% and were somewhat lower than analysts'
expectations. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s retail index of 21
retailers showed average gains of about 5.1%; Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons' weighted index of 13 major retail stores showed August
sales gains averaged about 4.8%.

   "Times are tough, and this is a bad omen for the second
half of the year," said Robert Buchanan of Alex. Brown.
   "Generally the numbers came in pretty weak, a little worse
than what we were looking for," said Margo McGlade, a retail
analyst at PaineWebber Inc. She estimated that sales gains at
the major retailers were flat on a seasonally adjusted basis.
   "I believe that if we aren't in a recession already we are
close to it," said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. He added: "The number of retailers
reporting on or ahead of plan is diminishing, and judging by
history and experience, we think that this is going to affect
everybody."
   Last month, Mr. Edelman and other retail analysts lowered
their earnings estimates for retailers. "And I know that we
will move lower before we are finished," he said.
   The lackluster August results sent a shock wave across the
market as retail industry stocks tumbled yesterday. Limited
Inc. closed at $15.625, off $1.125, on volume of almost two
million shares. J.C. Penney fell $1 to $45.875. Gap declined
$1.875 to $53.125 and Dayton Hudson dropped $1 to $57.25.
Wal-Mart fell 87.5 cents to $27.50 and Nordstrom slipped 75
cents to $21.75.
   Analysts were surprised by the August results at
Columbus-based Limited, where sales at stores open at least a
year rose only 1%. Analysts estimated that same-store sales
of three of Limited's principal divisions fell, including the
giant Limited Stores division, where analysts estimated
same-store sales fell 3% in August.
   Analysts also were disappointed by August sales at J.C.
Penney where same-store sales fell 2.4%. Penney's attributed
the decline to "exceptionally strong performance of the prior
year's period," and told analysts that furniture sales fell
more than 20% in August compared with a year earlier.
   Alex. Brown's Mr. Buchanan said: "Penney's is trying to
move up in quality and price points in a difficult economic
environment. It is hard to take away market share when their
{department store} competitors are becoming very
promotional."
   Analysts believe that retailers are starting to brace
themselves for a tough fall season. On Wednesday, retail
analysts visiting a new Paramus, N.J., Nordstrom store said
co-chairman Bruce Nordstrom told them he expects modest sales
for the remainder of the year and is making plans to cut
expenses and inventory levels at the Seattle-based
department-store chain.
   A Nordstrom spokesman confirmed that the store plans "some
across-the-board operating expense cutbacks" in the range of
3% to 12% for the rest of the year. "We anticipate at least
part of that will be personnel layoffs and inventory
cutbacks," the spokesman said.
   At Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's
largest retailer, same-store sales grew 4.1% in August, while
at Troy, Mich.-based K mart, the nation's second-largest
retailer, same-store sales gained 1.6%.
   A few retailers reported stronger August results.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., reported same-store
gains of 13%; San Francisco-based Gap Inc. said same-store
gains climbed 14%; and sales at Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis
grew 8% from a year earlier.
   But despite some bright spots, analysts believe the retail
sales climate is deteriorating across the country. Thomas
Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities noted that retail sales
are now softening in the Pacific Northwest, Southern
California and Texas, regions where sales had been stronger
than in the economically depressed Northeast.
   Adds PaineWebber's Ms. McGlade: "The picture may be even
dimmer than the major retailers' sales results suggest. The
public companies that report sales tend to be larger,
high-quality companies that are taking market share, so the
small mom-and-pops and the independent chains could be
suffering more than the big stores."
