   KFAR HABOD, Israel -- Elsewhere in Israel, stores are
selling out of baking soda. Supposedly, a towel soaked in a
solution of bicarbonate of soda and water makes a protective
mask against chemical weapons.
   But in this town, on the sandy Mediterranean plains
skirting Tel Aviv, preparations for a different, more joyful
event are under way. The ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish
movement known as the Lubavitchers, several thousand of whom
live here but follow the teachings of an 88-year-old rabbi in
Brooklyn, N.Y., believe that what seems to most like bad news
from the Persian Gulf is actually good news from on high.

   As Mendel Fogelman, 32, a plump, pink-cheeked Lubavitcher
visiting Kfar Habod from his home in Worcester, Mass., says,
with his dark eyes twinkling, "We're giving you a scoop. It's
going to be in all the papers, maybe even before you get this
into print. What is going on in Iraq is definitely a sign --
of the imminent arrival of the Messiah."
   Although Mr. Fogelman and the other Lubavitchers here are
brimming over with jokes -- thrusting a plate of cakes in
front of a guest, for instance, and cracking "go ahead, it's
OK, they're kosher" -- on the subject of the Messiah, they
are deadly serious. They have printed bumper stickers
reading, "We want {the} Messiah Now]" They have even built a
house, where the Messiah might want to live.
   The level of excitement and anticipation within the
movement, which is one of Judaism's most dynamic and
fastest-growing sources of ultra-orthodoxy, is almost
palpable. "We've been waiting a long time," says one such
Lubavitcher, Moshe Schlass, 51, a former macrobiotic
food-store owner from Greenwich Village whose five children
now crawl on and off of his lap during dinner at his home in
the ancient Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. "The conflict in the
Gulf is definitely part of the preparation for redemption.
What's going on now is like labor pains. It looks pretty
messy. But in the end what will come out is a new, living
light. The Messiah," he says, his voice growing hushed with
awe, "may be just an eye blink away."
   The Lubavitchers, who claim nearly 1,000 chapters and
millions of followers world-wide, have always awaited the
Messiah. They believe His coming is imminent because that's
what their much-beloved, absolute leader, Rabbi Menachem
Mendel Schneerson, believes. The Brooklyn rabbi, in turn,
cites the Bible as the source of this prophecy.
   Rabbi Schneerson is the seventh in a chain of Lubavitcher
rabbis stretching back to the beginnings of the pietistic
movement that reinvigorated Judaism in the early 18th
century. Unlike other orthodox Hasidic sects, which tend to
keep to themselves, Lubavitchers are actively engaged in the
modern world, reaching out eagerly to persuade less-orthodox
Jews to become more observant and running numerous charities
-- like the one in Kfar Habod, which provides health care to
200 Jewish children from Chernobyl who may have been exposed
to radiation.
   Remarkably, though, their leader has never been to Israel.
In fact, since taking over the leadership 40 years ago, Rabbi
Schneerson has scarcely set foot outside Brooklyn. Yet the
elfin-looking octogenarian with the large dark hat and
lustrous white beard -- who speaks 10 languages and holds an
engineering degree from the Sorbonne -- has tremendous sway
over tens of thousands of Israelis. A word from the rebbe, or
"My Great One," as he is affectionately called, was enough to
tip the electoral balance in two Israeli elections. Last
April, the rebbe snatched victory from the Labor Party after
telling his followers in the government to switch parties.
   Of topical significance to Rabbi Schneerson is a nearly
2,000-year-old passage from Isaiah 60:1, which was written
about in the 13th Century commentary on the Torah, "Yalkut
Shimoni." It makes some eerily familiar-sounding predictions.
For instance, it says that the Messiah will come after a
terrible war, in which the King of Persia, after turning on
the King of Arabia and consulting with the King of Jordan,
"will destroy the whole world." (The Lubavitchers believe
that the ancient name for Persia may correspond not just to
Iran but also to Iraq.) Although it predicts that
"Consternation and confusion will strike all of the nations
of the world," including "the Jewish people," God tells the
Jews to "Have no fear: the time of redemption has arrived."
   Thus, when asked two weeks ago in a letter from one of his
Israeli followers whether it was necessary to take
precautions against a potential Gulf war, such as stocking
extra food, Rabbi Schneerson said absolutely not. A number of
Israeli officials are inclined to agree: The army, which is
in charge of civil defense, has resolutely resisted
entreaties from the public to pass out its store of civilian
gas masks. But such secular assurances don't carry nearly the
weight of the rebbe's, whose word is infallible, at least in
Lubavitcher circles.
   "We've been following him very closely for 40 years, and
he hasn't been wrong yet," says one Lubavitcher scholar, Uri
Kaploun. Lubavitchers say Rabbi Schneerson correctly
predicted both the advent and outcome of the 1967 and 1973
wars. "All kinds of Biblical prophecies come true," says Mr.
Kaploun about the rebbe's current prediction. "And this is
going to happen, too." (The rebbe himself couldn't be reached
for comment; he doesn't talk to the press.)
   So while the rest of Israel frets about war with Saddam
Hussein, the Lubavitchers are ready to welcome a new kind of
peace. "When the Messiah comes," explains Lubavitcher
administrator Yossi Raichik, "sheep will live together with
the wolves, and people will be more spiritual -- there will
be no materialistic rat race, no jealousy, no lust."
   Not just a little lust?
   "Well," admits Mr. Raichik with a smile, "I'm a bit
worried about that too."
   Such qualms not withstanding, the preparations for the
Messiah are pretty impressive. Most eye-catching is an
imposing three-story, red brick edifice, which sticks out
from the barren desert here like an anomalous stage set. This
building is an exact replica of the Lubavtich world
headquarters in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn,
complete with the building's street number "770" Eastern
Parkway over the front door and metal anti-vandalism bars
over the windows, despite the rather low probability of theft
out here in no-man's land.
   Mr. Raichik says the strange building is evidence that
when it comes to believing in the Messiah, "We put our money
where our mouth is." As he explains it, "When the Messiah
comes, the rebbe will come to Israel, as will all the Jewish
people." And "where should the rebbe live, in the King David
Hotel?" asks Mr. Raichik. On the contrary: The rebbe should
live exactly as he does now, working 17 hours each day in a
building he is accustomed to. "So we prepared a building for
him to live in when he comes," says Mr. Raichik. "If you
believe it, you do it."
   Currently, the replica of 770 Eastern Parkway houses a
Talmudic school and the beginnings of an international
library. But on the first floor, behind locked doors, is a
copy of the rebbe's study, which Mr. Raichik has never been
in. "On the third floor we have an apartment," says Mr.
Raichik. "It's not furnished. It was left empty."
   But that's not all. Although Mr. Raichik is reluctant to
discuss the matter at much length, he and the other
Lubavitchers believe that it is possible that the rebbe will
not just come to Israel to live as an ordinary resident.
Actually, he may be the Messiah.
   "I believe that the rebbe is a potential candidate for the
Messiah," says Mr. Raichik carefully. "Every generation has a
candidate. And in this generation, he's definitely the best
one," adds Mr. Fogelman. "There is a chance that the rebbe is
the Messiah," agrees Mr. Schlass, who notes that among other
things, the rebbe has the right hereditary qualifications.
(That and his marriage to the daughter of the sixth
Lubavitcher rabbi qualified him for the leadership.) "The
Messiah has to trace back to David, and the rebbe is traced
to Judah, who is traced to David, on both his mother's and
his father's sides," Mr. Schlass says.
   Such speculation is said to make the Rebbe very
uncomfortable, although his detractors note, he has never
denied his Messianic potential. It certainly makes the more
media-savvy of his followers uncomfortable. A day after
explaining how the house at Kfar Habod had been built for the
rebbe after redemption, Mr. Raichik called repeatedly to
"clarify" the matter. The building, he suggested, in fact has
many purposes. The rebbe himself has directed his followers
to fill the empty third floor. And even given the
significance of the situation in the Gulf, and the likelihood
that redemption is near, nothing is certain enough to get
locked into print.
   "Don't write that the Messiah will live there," says Mr.
Raichik upon consideration. "If I read it myself, I'd say
come on, give me a break."
