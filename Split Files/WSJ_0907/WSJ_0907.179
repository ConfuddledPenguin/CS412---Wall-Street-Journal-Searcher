   The Middle East erupts. Business failures increase. Big
corporations batten down the hatches for recession.
   But small business will fare better than many expect, says
William C. Dunkelberg. "Small businesses have nothing to
worry about. They've seen it all before," he says.

   The 47-year-old Mr. Dunkelberg, one of the country's best
known small-business economists, still sees little to make
him abandon his usual optimistic outlook for small business.
His views enjoy a wide following. Currently dean of Temple
University's School of Business and Management, Mr.
Dunkelberg is also chief economist of the National Federation
of Independent Business, the country's largest small-business
group. He produces the federation's influential quarterly
economic report for small business.
   In a recent interview, Mr. Dunkelberg discussed prospects
for small companies in today's economic climate:
                                                                                                       

   Q. Given the growth in business failures lately, is small
business facing an economic recession?
   A. No. Economic activity among small businesses looks too
strong to produce a recession this year.
   The economy has just gone through an unprecedented
expansion and this growth created an unrealistic exuberance.
When reality set in, many firms found that the markets
weren't big enough to support all of the new entrants and
that the high growth rates, in fact, wouldn't go on forever.
   High rates of growth invariably produce high failure rates
when the economy begins to adjust itself. But that doesn't
mean that small business isn't healthy.
                                                                                                       

   Q. But isn't overall business activity slowing down?
   A. Yes. But the slowdown is relative to peak levels of
activity achieved during eight years of economic expansion.
Most small businesses would probably be happy to freeze
today's performance if they could be guaranteed it for the
next five years. They'd rather do that than take their
chances with an uncertain economy.
   Things look bad only because we've had a decade of
extraordinary growth under the Reagan Administration. What we
are experiencing is a period of slower growth, not a downturn
of cataclysmic proportions.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Still, given the Iraq crisis and its impact on oil
prices, the cost of the savings and loan bailout and
continued economic weakness, small businesses can't be
breathing easy.
   A. Historically, war has always provided a stimulus for
economic growth. War means heavy government spending, more
jobs, higher incomes . . . and small business benefits
greatly in this scenario.
   The major threat the S&amp;L crisis poses to small business is
that interest rates will continue to stay high. Fortunately,
many small businesses have no debt or don't rely heavily on
frequent borrowing.
   {Only 11% of business owners queried in the latest NFIB
survey said financing was harder to arrange than earlier in
the year. Only 12% -- up from 9% in the previous quarter --
said they expected borrowing to be more difficult in the
coming months.}
   What is most worrisome for small businesses is the
continuing weakness in the economy. That translates into
fewer customers through the door, lower cash flow and a
reduction in employment. But a war and the increased spending
that accompanies it should more than counteract the
weaknesses in the economy.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Do small businesses share your vision?
   A. Small-business optimism is the lowest it's been since
1982. We're back at pre-expansion levels. But the bottom
hasn't dropped out of the outlook as it did in 1979.
   In sharp contrast to 1979, small businesses still have
plans to hire. They have no excessive inventory. Most
important, they have been managing their firms in the
expectation of a repeat of the recession they faced between
1980 and 1982.
   {In the NFIB's latest quarterly economic survey, 22% of
those queried said they expected business to worsen, compared
with 14% in the previous quarter.}
                                                                                                       

   Q. How will small business fare over the next five years?
   A. The prospects for small firms are excellent. First, the
outlook for the economy is good. Within that framework, the
successful firm of the future has to be flexible, more
niche-oriented, able to change quickly to changes in demand
and in technology. All these -- characteristics of small
businesses -- favor the smaller size firm.
                                                                                                       

   Q. You feel that small businesses will do better than the
economy as a whole?
   A. I don't think so. One reason is that legislators may
force smaller firms to carry a larger share of the costs of
the social programs in the '90s. Such programs as parental
leave, disability, environment and health care will become
costlier and small businesses will be asked to increase their
contribution. The difficulty of attracting qualified labor --
and the costs of training -- will also raise costs for small
firms. Nonetheless, small businesses will contribute a
greater portion of the new job growth in the next decade.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Will some small businesses benefit more than others?
   A. That's really a guessing game, isn't it? Still, there
are some fundamental factors that help identify those more
likely to succeed.
   Service businesses, which are dominated by small firms,
will continue to demonstrate strong growth, especially in
areas of information processing and services. Manufacturing
also will become attractive because of its high-tech
component and its need for adaptability.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Who's likely to be hurt the most?
   A. Specialized retailers in urban areas. The deterioration
of urban markets means a shrinking customer base and fewer
customers. Small construction firms also face serious
problems for the next five years. We've tremendously
overbuilt and the demographics are turning negative for
further expansion: We have a seven-year supply of office
space, three-year supply of multi-family housing units and an
overabundance of traditional family homes for a decade.
   A rise in oil prices obviously will affect such
fuel-intensive businesses as transportation. But if business
demand stays strong, they can pass it on to the customer.
