   Wednesday's decision by a federal judge to hand Franklin
Savings Association of Kansas back to its former officials is
surely one strong sign that the Savings and Loan crisis, bad
enough to begin with, has been poorly handled. And this in
turn tells a lot about the sorry state of the current
economy.
   Back in April, we ran a long editorial on the S&amp;L bailout
titled "Financial Vietnam." One of its subsections was called
"Franklin and Other Blunders." We described how the
Resolution Trust Corp. seized Franklin though it "was a
solvent institution, not likely to go belly-up soon."

   We described the Franklin operation, which wasn't a
traditional thrift but an institution that accepted brokered
deposits to finance a portfolio of mortgaged-backed bonds,
and then hedged against interest-rate movements to provide a
guaranteed return. We said this was a way to "distill out the
financial essence" of deposit insurance, and understood why
regulators were disturbed. But by seizing the institution, on
a disagreement about when to recognize paper losses
offsetting paper gains, regulators "have chosen the course of
maximum disruption, maximum cost to the taxpayer, and maximum
risk to the financial system."
   Which is pretty much what the judge ruled. Judge Dale
Saffels understood the hedging technique but said the
regulators "lacked adequate training and understanding to
evaluate" Franklin. There was no reason for regulators to
force Franklin into technical violation of federal capital
requirements. Judge Saffels was unusually qualified to handle
this case; he is past chairman of the board of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka. Judge Saffels, who explained his
decision to reporters, ordered that the keys to Franklin be
returned to its owners as of 10 a.m. yesterday.
   For nearly seven months, the Office of Thrift Supervision
kept Franklin in limbo. Now, Franklin Chairman Ernest
Fleischer will try to bring back key employees and
depositors. Thrift regulators will appeal the ruling, and
yesterday got a temporary stay order, but there is added
risk.
   Franklin could cite a recent decision by the U.S. Claims
Court that the owners of thrifts wrongly seized by regulators
can bring Fifth Amendment Takings Clause cases; Franklin's
holders of $2.9 billion in zero-coupon bonds forced by
regulators to redeem early also have a claim to compensation.
On top of the costs of the S&amp;L bailout, the Treasury may have
to pay out billions to thrift owners because of overzealous
regulators.
   This case is a reminder that fraud was only a part,
probably a small part, of the S&amp;L disaster. The bigger
problem was the predictable consequence of deposit insurance.
   As it happens, Mr. Fleischer wrote us in April agreeing
with our larger point that there is no justification for a
separate Savings and Loan industry. "In my testimony before
the Senate Banking Committee last year I asserted the very
same thing," Mr. Fleischer wrote. "Furthermore, I suggested
that if the Congress does want to subsidize housing in
America, it should do so through direct transfers to the
needy, not through the thrift industry." This was scarcely
your typical thrift executive urging Congress to boost
deposit insurance to $100,000 an account, the biggest blunder
of the S&amp;L crisis.
   Congress made the original blunder, and also leaned on
regulators to go easy on thrifts. Once freed of this burden,
however, regulators overreacted, throwing potentially viable
thrifts out with fraud-ridden ones. This has served to run up
the costs to the taxpayer, both directly and by needlessly
helping to slow the general economy into its recent torpor.
