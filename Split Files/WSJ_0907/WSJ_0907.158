   NEW YORK -- With war in the air and corporate earnings
looking shaky, stock market investors have a new game:
defensive growth.
   Growth-stock managers saw their portfolios soar in the
first half of this year. But now, many are shedding old
consumer growth favorites such as Walt Disney Co. and
shifting into a group they have dubbed "defensive growth" or
"recession-resistant growth."

   Defensive growth companies are resistant to war and
recession, they say, while still delivering robust earnings
growth.
   Now, with the economy looking even sicker than it did a
month ago, defensive growth companies that are expanding
earnings at 15% to 20% a year are even more attractive, the
growth-stock stalwarts insist.
   "We think recent events have underscored the importance of
owning growth stocks," says Graham Tanaka, president of
Tanaka Capital Management Inc.
   Eldon Mayer, chairman of growth-stock manager Lynch &amp;
Mayer Inc., says he recently cut his holdings of
consumer-related stocks such as MCI Communications Corp.,
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Disney, and bought defensive
issues such as Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
Merck &amp; Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Gillette Co.
   Mr. Tanaka says, "We would like to buy recession-resistant
growth stocks." And he says he has found an attractive story
in National Health Laboratories Inc. "They are the
lowest-cost provider of clinical lab testing, they are
growing earnings at 20% to 25% rate without acquisitions," he
says. "They have a high return on equity."
   He still likes his holdings of Humana Inc., American
Cyanamid Co. and Pfizer Inc. "The health-care sector has held
up beautifully," he says.
   All share a defensive-growth theme: No matter how high oil
prices go or how deeply the economy slumps, people still get
sick.
   For the first half of this year, growth-stock managers
were superstars of investing. As investors saw the economy
grinding toward even slower growth, they rushed into
companies that would generate earnings because of their
strong products, strong franchises and talented management.
Growth-stock managers already owned many of these stocks and
watched them soar.
   Growth-stock managers were confident that a select group
of consumer issues could still generate hefty earnings
increases, even as a slowing economy muddled along; few
predicted a severe recession.
   Now, amid war clouds in the Mideast, consumer confidence
is sliding. Rising oil prices have added to inflation
pressures. And, most important, earnings estimates for
hundreds of stocks are being drastically slashed.
   Benjamin Zacks, executive vice president at Zacks
Investment Research, says 72% of the analysts' revisions in
their 1991 earnings estimates for about 4,000 companies
tracked by his company have been downgradings. No sector of
the stock market, except energy, has been spared. In a recent
survey, Mr. Zacks found that the percentage of downgradings
for 1990 and 1991 earnings was even higher, 78%, for cyclical
stocks whose fortunes rise and fall with the economy.
   "What we want to avoid to the greatest possible extent is
negative earnings surprises," Mr. Mayer, the money manager,
says of his recent defensive-growth purchases.
   What is questionable is whether there really are
bulletproof growth stocks, immune to economic and political
shocks. While many growth managers are still ahead of market
benchmarks for the year, the Mideast conflict has made the
growth bet more risky.
   Many growth stocks were sold in the market's slide last
month. But many investors hung on to their shares, hoping for
a resolution of the Mideast crisis quickly and without much
economic damage. Consequently, growth stocks could be poised
for big losses if investors start to bail out of the market.
   "If the stock market starts to go down a lot -- for
whatever reason -- people aren't going to sell Boston
Edison," says Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "They are going to sell the large,
liquid, big-name growth stocks." Elizabeth Bramwell, chief
investment officer of the Gabelli Growth Fund, agrees that
the risks are greater now for managers who are still betting
on growth issues. With peace blooming across the globe
earlier this summer, growth-stock managers were ecstatic
about the earnings opportunities for companies with
international franchises, such as McDonald's Corp. and
PepsiCo Inc. Now, long-term earnings expectations for
multinational corporations have undergone a sharp
reassessment.
   "In the first half, peace was breaking out around the
world -- you could take a longer-term view," Ms. Bramwell
says. "We were looking to the year 2000. Then we shrank back
to what's going to happen in the next 24 hours."
   With these threats in mind, she, too, has moved her
portfolio toward defensive growth. She has bought Medical
Care International Inc., which she expects to show a 25% to
30% improvement in earnings in 1991. She also likes
Colgate-Palmolive Co., Tambrands Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble.
The big agricultural firm Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. is her
largest holding.
   "It's really too bad," Ms. Bramwell says. "The year
started off so positively."
