   International Business Machines Corp. announced a joint
venture with Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. to produce an
underlying layer of software that they hope will speed
development of personal-computer software applications.
   The software industry would welcome any progress: Slow
development of software is often cited as holding back sales
of both software and hardware in the computer industry.

   At the same time, there is a bewildering array of software
and hardware "environments" competing for the affections of
companies that develop software applications. Thus, some
companies may see the IBM-Metaphor venture as simply
confusing issues further by adding yet another software
environment. In any case, the venture's software won't be
available for a couple of years.
   "I think the venture is interesting. I think it's worth
watching. I think Metaphor has very good software
interfaces," said Michele Preston, a securities analyst at
Cowen &amp; Co. "But it's going to take some time, and as we all
know the number of changes that can take place in the
(software) world in two years is enormous."
   The two companies will take advantage of some advances in
a fairly new type of programming, called object-oriented
programming. Among other things, object-oriented work lets
programmers re-use sections of code that others have already
written and makes it easier for programmers to update
existing software. Steven P. Jobs's Next Inc. workstations,
for example, run software developed in an object-oriented
environment, and software developers have described that
environment as the most innovative and welcome feature of the
machines.
   The software will be designed for use with either the OS/2
or Unix operating system -- a layer of software that controls
the basic operations of a computer. The software won't mean
that someone using an OS/2-based application on a PC could
use it on a workstation using a Unix application. But it
should make it easier for a programmer to translate software
from one operating system to the other.
   David Liddle, chairman of closely held Metaphor, Mountain
View, Calif., said that as many as 200 programmers will be
involved in the effort. He said IBM will sell the software on
its own machines, while Metaphor will have the right to sell
the software to other hardware makers.
