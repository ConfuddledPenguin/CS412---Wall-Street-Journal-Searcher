   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in July
dropped 10% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
87% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 566,000 metric tons of
market pulp in July, compared with 629,000 metric tons a year
earlier. A metric ton equals about 2,204.62 pounds.

   The July operating rate was up from 80% in June but down
from 99% a year earlier.
   For this year through July, Canadian mills produced
3,818,000 metric tons of market pulp, down 9.2% from
4,207,000 metric tons a year earlier. For the first seven
months, the industry operated at 86% of capacity, down from
97% a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
   Total market shipments in July dropped 14% to 441,000
metric tons from 513,000 tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets were down.
   Market shipments for the first seven months also fell 14%
to 3,479,000 metric tons from 4,062,000 tons a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of July totaled
698,000 metric tons, a 44-day supply, which was up from
573,000 metric tons, a 35-day supply, at the end of June, and
from 384,000 tons, or a 20-day supply, at the end of July
1989.
