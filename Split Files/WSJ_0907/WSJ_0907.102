   Pic 'N' Save Corp. posted a fiscal second-quarter loss of
$9.3 million, or 27 cents a share, after $19 million in
one-time pretax charges related to its recent proxy contest
and restructuring.
   In the quarter ended July 2, 1989, the Dominguez, Calif.,
company earned $6.4 million, or 18 cents a share. This year's
second quarter ended July 29.

   Sales rose 11%, to $112.7 million from $101.8 million.
   Operating earnings, excluding the onetime charges, fell to
$6.6 million from $12.1 million. Pic 'N' Save blamed the drop
on shrinkage in its gross profit rate, higher store expenses
as a percentage of sales and higher interest expenses.
   Pic 'N' Save, a retail chain that specializes in close-out
merchandise, recently cut short a threatened proxy fight with
Girard Partners Limited Partnership and investor David
Batchelder by agreeing to put Mr. Batchelder and two
associates on the board, among other things.
