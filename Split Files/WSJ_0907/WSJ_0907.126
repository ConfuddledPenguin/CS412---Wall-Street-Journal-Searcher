   CHICAGO -- Just as many Americans think Japanese cars are
better-built and Swiss clocks better-timed, U.S. fliers think
foreign carriers are the way to fly.
   No U.S. airline broke the top 10 rank in an airline survey
released yesterday by the researchers of Zagat's Restaurant
Survey. Primarily European and Asian carriers were on top,
but one Latin American surprise -- Brazil's Varig airlines --
also cracked the top 10.

   "The internationals killed the domestics," said Nick
Tortorello, chairman of Research and Forecasts Inc., which
analyzed the data for Zagat's. "There are some things that
the domestic airlines could learn from the internationals."
   Singapore Airlines, Swissair and Japan Air Lines held the
top three slots in the survey. Singapore's farewell gifts,
Swissair's chocolates and JAL's sushi win those airlines
points.
   The airline survey, conducted between January and June,
was based on responses from 4,463 fliers participating in a
broader travel poll of hotels and car rental agencies. The
results of those polls will be released later this year. The
fliers scored 27 carriers on comfort, service, timeliness,
food and cost. Zagat researchers compiled a rating based on
everything but cost.
   The best ranking fliers could give a U.S. carrier was the
number 11 position. That was captured by AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines unit. U.S. airlines couldn't break the top 10 list
either for the separate categories of comfort, service and
food. In the overall ratings, Eastern Airlines only beat the
Soviet Union's Aeroflot, which was rated the worst.
   "Does our domestic service hurt us? Sure, it does," says
George Mueller, vice president of customer service at
American. "It would be foolhardy for me to say that our
service between Dallas and Chicago is the same as our service
to Frankfurt."
   Many Americans say service in the airline industry
particularly withered during the merger fever and
blood-letting competition that followed the deregulation of
the industry in 1978.
   "There certainly is a perception that there are a lot of
things wrong with U.S. airlines," says Tim Zagat, editor of
the survey carrying his name. U.S. fliers "look at the
industry as being in considerable disarray," he says.
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines is in the middle of a $4.38
billion employee-led buy-out. NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines
is highly leveraged after a $3.65 billion takeover took it
private last year. Eastern Airlines has been operating under
bankruptcy-law protection since spring 1989.
   "After deregulation, the U.S. carriers focused on price as
their primary marketing tool and service started to
deteriorate," says Michael Derchin, an airlines analyst at
County NatWest Securities Corp. "Meanwhile, the international
airlines, which weren't deregulated, continued to focus on
service. That was the tradeoff that U.S. carriers had to
make."
   In the old days, passengers reminisce that if they needed
help putting their carry-on luggage in the overhead
compartments, flight attendants would help them. No longer,
they complain. Fliers mostly have to elicit the help of other
passengers while attendants watch.
   That's in stark contrast, they note, to service on foreign
carriers. Take Singapore Airlines where flight attendants
call passengers by name.
   U.S. public opinion about foreign airlines seems to
parallel attitudes about foreign-made cars. Only one U.S. car
manufacturer made a top 10 list of quality cars in a 1990
survey of car owners by J.D. Power &amp; Associates, an auto
market research company.
   Likewise, only three U.S. airlines broke a list of top 10
international airlines in a reader poll conducted by Business
Traveler International last year. Only one U.S. carrier in
the past 16 years has won a passenger service award presented
by Air Transport World, an industry publication.
   One reason U.S. airlines aren't as impressive: Many
foreign airlines are all or partly government-owned and they
receive subsidies that don't force them to watch the bottom
line like hawks. As a result, they can afford special
touches, airline experts say.
   Midway Airlines, based on Chicago's South Side, serves
meals shrink-wrapped. State-owned Thai Airways International,
in contrast, serves orchids with its meals.
   "Cost isn't as much a consideration for them as it is for
somebody like Bob Crandall," chairman of AMR, says Dana
Henderson, who conducted the Air Transport World survey. Mr.
Crandall once boasted about how he had cut costs by paring
olives from in-flight meals.
   Industry experts say that labor costs, the industry's
number one expense, are also much lower at some Asian
carriers, where work rules are typically looser and wages
cheaper.
   Industry travel experts admit that Americans might have an
inflated opinion of foreign carriers because they mostly fly
them on higher-grade international flights, where the
carriers can pamper fliers for hours. They rarely fly foreign
airlines on their domestic routes, where carriers such as Air
France are as hamstrung by air traffic delays as U.S.
carriers are stateside.
