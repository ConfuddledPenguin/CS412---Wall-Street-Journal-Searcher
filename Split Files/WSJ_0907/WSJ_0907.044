   With a handful of novels, T. Coraghessan Boyle has
established himself as one of the most inventive writers
around. Pared-down tales of ordinary life are not for him:
Mr. Boyle's novels careen through history and time, hop from
continent to continent and make frequent pit stops for sex,
substance abuse and the supernatural.
   Big subjects suit this more-is-better approach, and Mr.
Boyle is at his best when he takes a page from history and
lets his imagination run wild scribbling over it. The real
17th-century explorer Mungo Park was the inspiration for his
1981 novel "Water Music." A roller-coaster ride of a book,
"Water Music" entwined Mungo's search for the source of the
Niger with the fortunes of Ned Rise, a London rogue.

   North America's colonial past was the point of departure
for his 1987 "World's End," arguably his best novel to date.
Walter Van Brunt, a native of a sleepy Hudson Valley town
called Peterskill, finds himself literally haunted by the
ghosts of his family history. Weaving between Walter's
present in the 1960s and his Dutch immigrant ancestors'
17th-century past, this richly imagined tale of treachery and
blood ties worked a kind of magic realism on suburban New
York -- something this former Larchmont resident would have
thought impossible.
   High expectations may be partly responsible for my
disappointment with "East Is East" (Viking, 364 pages,
$19.95), Mr. Boyle's latest novel. This tale of a half-breed
Japanese sailor who goes AWOL in a Georgia swamp lacks much
of the manic energy that propels the best of Mr. Boyle's
fiction.
   The orphaned son of an American hippie father and a rock
'n' roll-crazed Japanese mother, Hiro Tanaka is tormented as
"a half-breed, a `happa', a high-nose and butterstinker." He
soothes his loneliness with food and the works of self-styled
samurai/writer Yukio Mishima. Hiro dreams of losing himself
in the multiracial crowds of America, and signs on as third
cook on a States-bound ship. After a flare-up with his
shipmates lands him in the brig, he jumps ship with $8 and a
copy of his precious Mishima taped to his chest.
   Hiro washes up on swampy Tupelo Island, home to assorted
rednecks, genteel old-timers and Thanatopsis House, an
artists' colony run by the aged Septima Lights.
   Mr. Boyle lampoons this plushly appointed retreat with
gusto. At Thanatopsis, a servitor wakes colonists with a
different Romance-language greeting each morning, colonists
breakfast at "silent" or "convivial" tables, and the writing
bungalows are fittingly named for literary suicides. The
colonists include a lecherous middle-aged writer, a musician
who composes works for piano and alarm clock, and Ruth
Dershowitz, a talentless writer-wannabe whose main
qualification for residency is her romance with Septima's
son, Saxby.
   When Ruth discovers Hiro stealing her daily lunch pail
from the porch of her writing bungalow, she latches onto him
as "a living story, a fiction come to life." Ruth gives her
new-found pet food and shelter, hides him from a pair of
bumbling immigration officers and briefly beds him.
   In an unwitting return for these favors, Hiro is
incorporated into her soppy work-in-progress about a
Japanese-American housewife. When he finally grows restless
for escape, Ruth tries to placate him with cans of fried fish
and bamboo shoots.
   The idea of a writer imprisoning her subject in a
velvet-padded cage is a provocative one, but it is only
sketchily developed here. Hiro is soon on the run again,
dashing from Ruth's bungalow to a fresh series of
misadventures that land him first in an antebellum jail cell,
and finally in the alligator-infested heart of the Okefenokee
Swamp.
   These Keystone Kop-style escapades are full of sound and
motion, but with a sour edge. Just about everywhere he goes,
Hiro meets the same reception: "He saw the hate in their cold
rinsed-out "hakujin" eyes . . . he was an insect, a snake,
something to be stepped on and ground into the dirt,
eliminated." Almost universally despised, hunted down like an
escaped murderer, used and ultimately betrayed by the woman
who sheltered him, Hiro is a punching bag of a character.
"The City of Brotherly Love was an illusion," he muses toward
the end. "In defeat, there was only one path to honor, and
that was death."
   Mr. Boyle may be reaching for black humor with Hiro's
doomed search for the picture-perfect America of his dreams.
If so, he misses the mark. Unrelieved by any governing sense
of irony, Hiro's plight is just plain sad.
   If "East Is East" isn't great Boyle, it's still very
entertaining, thanks to the quirky and engaging characters
that pop up at its margins. A Ramboesque Vietnam vet tries to
lure Hiro from the swamps with disco music and traps baited
with designer T-shirts and jeans; and in one of the funniest
scenes, a dazed old woman invites him into her home because
she thinks he is Seiji Ozawa.
   But the lunatic energy that has made this writer so much
fun to read is mostly missing. "East Is East" is a curiously
small book, as circumscribed as the island on which it is
set. Mr. Boyle should stick to the mainland -- when he's at
his best, his imagination eats up miles faster than a 747.
