   In response to James B. Rule's demand for privacy from
"junk mail" (editorial page, Aug. 15) he can contact the
Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service to
have his name removed from mailing lists. Considering the
costs of postage, mailing lists and printing, most marketers
will gladly refrain from sending materials to those who will
not buy things by mail.
   As for Mr. Rule's demands of 20 cents for each time his
name is sold, I suggest that he also ask for payment each
time he is assaulted by television or radio advertising, or
that he receive a rebate from the publisher of his newspaper
or favorite magazine. Just as we can choose to ignore print
or media advertising, so, too, can we simply throw away
direct mail advertising. No one is forcing Mr. Rule to open
his mail.
