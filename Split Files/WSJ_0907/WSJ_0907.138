   Many computer makers are increasingly exasperated with
chip maker Motorola Inc.
   Motorola wowed the industry in early 1989 with a new
microprocessor called the 68040, only to hold up mass
production of the chip repeatedly because of design flaws.
Motorola now pledges to start shipping the part in quantity
in October, computer makers say, as much as nine months later
than it first promised.

   Even if the chip maker meets its latest deadline, the
snafu already has forced the computer makers that rely on
Motorola to delay significantly the introduction of their
next generation of machines. In the industry's fast-paced
game of leapfrog, with computer makers regularly outdoing
each other, such delays can spell big losses in market share.
   The delay's biggest casualty is Hewlett-Packard Palo Alto,
Calif., a loyal Motorola customer that planned to use the
68040 as the "brain" in more than half of its workstations by
year end. HP has watched its market share slide -- blaming,
in part, the elusive Motorola chip. "If we had the 040 today,
we would probably be stronger in the workstation business,"
says Douglas Johnson, product-marketing manager for HP's
Motorola-based computers.
   The tardy chip also may delay the shipment of a new
machine by Next Inc., the Redwood City, Calif., workstation
start-up founded by Steven P. Jobs. And smaller computer
makers say they have delayed machines by as much as a year
because of the belated chip.
   To understand the overdue chip's impact, imagine General
Motors Corp. facing a nine-month delay in getting engines for
its new-model autos while rivals sell their new cars as fast
as they can. Motorola's computer-company customers lack the
"engines," the 68040 chips, that they need to control the
machines they were ready to build as early as January. While
they wait, they must watch competitors grab markets using
rival chips, including Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line 80486
microprocessor and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Sparc chip.
   Motorola stands to lose market share, too, though it
garners only a small fraction of its revenue from
microprocessor sales. As Motorola is fine-tuning its 68040,
Intel is expected to sell 230,000 of its 80486 chip this year
and 880,000 in 1991, according to market researcher In-Stat
Inc. Motorola, Schaumburg, Ill., already is a distant second
to Intel, Santa Clara, Calif., in chip sales, partly because
it didn't win wide acceptance for earlier chips in its 68000
family.
   Moreover, Motorola's foray into a popular new technology,
called reduced instruction-set computing (RISC), is running a
distant third behind RISC chips designed by Sun, Mountain
View, Calif., and Mips Computer Systems Inc., Sunnyvale,
Calif.
   "The 040 fiasco certainly hurts Motorola's credibility,"
says analyst Robert Herwick at Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "Most of
the market has already thrown the 68000 {series} into the
ground. This is the last dirt on the coffin."
   Motorola's stock hasn't been doing well, either. It took a
terrible beating yesterday, after analyst James Barlage of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. reduced his recommendation
on the stock to "avoid" because of lower electronics-industry
growth expectations. The shares closed at $61.50, down
$7.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. With
almost 2.3 million shares changing hands, it was the most
active stock on the Big Board.
   Not everyone is so concerned. Apple Computer Inc.,
Cupertino, Calif., a longtime user of Motorola chips, says
there haven't been any adverse effects so far on its plans to
develop a 68040-based Macintosh. HP says it won't abandon the
68000 family. And most traditional Motorola users praise the
68040 as an excellent design that stalwart "Motorola bigots,"
in industry parlance, will wait for.
   But enemy camps are gaining converts among new customers.
"I don't think there's any question that new buyers are going
to look elsewhere first," says analyst Alice Leeper at
Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm.
   That's what Unisys Corp. found. The company planned to
sell a 68040-based machine this summer, says John Chen, vice
president of the Unix systems division of Unisys, Blue Bell,
Pa. But some customers can't wait any longer, he says, so
Unisys steers them to its Intel-based products.
   "The scary part," Mr. Chen adds, "the real competitor, is
RISC." Sun-based and Mips-based machines are quickly gaining
share in the workstation market. Every month that the new
Motorola chip is delayed means it is less likely to become a
major player. "There's a lot of competition out there, and
Motorola isn't in that competition," says Gary Thomas, vice
president of UniFLEX Computing Ltd., a Chapel Hill, N.C.,
software house that has specialized in Motorola chips but now
plans to write programs for Sun's Sparc chips, too.
   The main culprit in Motorola's lateness is its chip's
complexity. Chip makers are cramming more functions on their
wares to meet computer makers' demands for a faster, cheaper
and smaller set of chips. A single 68040 contains 1.2 million
transistors and combines functions that require as many as 50
chips in most computers, says Jack Browne, director of
marketing for Motorola microprocessors, who calls the delay
"pretty serious but not disastrous."
   Motorola was already late when it unveiled a prototype of
the chip in January that it planned to ship in volume by the
middle of this year. But the early samples it sent out had
scores of bugs. For instance, computer makers say they found
the chips wouldn't work without cooling devices. There were
instructions that didn't work. Some software caused strange
results or froze the chip up completely.
   By late spring, it was clear Motorola wasn't going to meet
its schedule. This summer, Motorola was still sending out
samples with a long "errata sheet," a list of the known flaws
in the chip, says Joseph Ramunni, president of Dallas-based
Mizar Inc., which makes computer boards. "If, in fact, there
are chips that do work, we sure aren't getting them," he
says.
   Bugs are commonplace in early chip versions. Intel's
best-selling 80386 chips were shipped in high volumes with
many bugs, which were later corrected, and Intel's 80486 ran
into well publicized bugs last year. But Motorola's bugs are
showing up when the competition already has viable,
"debugged" options on the market.
   As Motorola's delivery schedule dragged out this summer,
HP hedged its bets by unveiling its new Series 400 computer
line, which uses the older 68030 chip but can be upgraded to
use a 68040. Still, the delay is "having a pretty sizable
impact" on HP, says analyst John Jones of Montgomery
Securities, who adds that the late chip is the biggest factor
in HP's flat revenue in workstations for the last three
quarters. That particularly hurts because HP has been under
increasing pressure in the workstation market. The combined
market share of HP and its Apollo unit fell to 25% last year
from about 49% in 1985, according to International Data Corp.
   But while analysts say HP has the muscle to recover,
start-ups aren't so confident about their future. "We've
literally got all our business depending on getting good
chips from Motorola," says Gene Manno, president of Arix
Corp., a San Jose, Calif., computer company that planned to
ship a 68040-based machine in June. Now Arix can't sell its
computer until at least early 1991, Mr. Manno says, and its
revenues have fallen 10% to 15% below expectations. "I've
really got to have this part," he says. "Our whole future
depends on it."
   Mr. Browne says Motorola is now "on track" and doesn't
foresee more delays. Customers are crossing their fingers.
"Now it's like the question of when's Iraq going to leave
Kuwait," says Ron Stack, sales manager for General Micro
Systems Inc., Montclair, Calif., which planned to sell a
68040 product last January. "Is it ever going to come out or
what?"
