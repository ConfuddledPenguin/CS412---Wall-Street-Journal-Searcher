   The meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev Sunday in Helsinki is intended to send a
strong message to Iraq that the new-found Washington-Moscow
unity isn't about to crack.
   The meeting "is a fairly dramatic way of signaling that
things are getting tougher and tougher for Saddam Hussein,"
says a senior Bush administration official involved in
preparing for the talks. "It should remove from his mind any
thoughts that he can split the U.S. and the Soviets on this
one."

   But officials in Washington are well aware that Mr.
Gorbachev will first need some explanations of American
intentions in the Persian Gulf. They say Mr. Bush may advise
Mr. Gorbachev that a small U.S. presence could remain
indefinitely as part of a planned new security arrangement in
the region. The State Department is already contemplating a
Soviet role in any such arrangement, U.S. officials say.
   For his part, Mr. Gorbachev is likely to explain why
Soviet military specialists still are stationed in Iraq. In
public, the Kremlin has insisted that the 160 specialists
weren't involved in Iraqi preparations for the Kuwait
invasion and will be withdrawn when their contracts expire.
In private, however, Mr. Gorbachev seems embarrassed by the
controversy they are causing and reportedly raised the issue
at a recent meeting of his Presidential Council. Now that
most Soviet civilians have been evacuated from both Iraq and
Kuwait, the advisers may be pulled out rapidly, Soviet
officials say.
   Behind such seemingly minor details, some Soviet analysts
detect a bigger discrepancy in the longer-term aims of
Washington and Moscow. Both sides agree on the immediate goal
of getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. But beyond that, "I
don't expect the positions {at Helsinki} will be identical,"
says Andrei Kortunov, an analyst at Moscow's U.S.A. and
Canada Institute. "Objectively, the interests of the Soviet
Union and the U.S. are a bit different."
   Mr. Kortunov and others in Moscow contend that while the
U.S. wants to dislodge Saddam Hussein in favor of a more
pro-Western leader, the Kremlin is worried about the effects
of military upheaval in the region. It doesn't want to send
the wrong signals to other Soviet allies in the Middle East,
such as Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization, for
fear they may become more radical. And officials point out
that Moscow and Baghdad are still bound by a 1972 treaty of
friendship and cooperation, with Iraq owing the Soviets more
than $6 billion.
   "The preferable option {for Moscow} is a compromise
involving Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait that allows Saddam
Hussein to save some face publicly, not a total collapse of
the regime," Mr. Kortunov says. But if it became a question
of siding with Iraq or siding with the U.S., Mr. Gorbachev
wouldn't hesitate to choose the latter. "Ultimately, too much
is at stake," Mr. Kortunov says. "Gorbachev would yield."
   Iraq is seeking to exploit any differences that exist
between Moscow and Washington. After meeting Mr. Gorbachev in
the Kremlin, Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, yesterday
described the talks as "constructive, cordial and frank,"
though he admitted there were differences. Unlike the U.S.,
Moscow is prepared to give Iraq a hearing, Mr. Aziz said.
"Our Soviet friends are attentive. I appreciate their
listening to us."
   The U.S. may end up paying a price for continued close
Soviet cooperation over the Persian Gulf crisis.
   After more than a year of aborted efforts, Moscow is now
on the verge of reforms in its creaky economy that would
abandon central planning for a market system. Soviet
economists say such a plan can only succeed if the West
provides aid during a difficult transition period. But so
far, only West Germany has provided cash. Most other Western
nations, including the U.S., have been lukewarm at best.
   Washington is hinting that it may now be willing to do
more. "I think it's fair to say that the Soviet cooperation
in the Gulf has impressed us to the point that we are even
more interested in being supportive economically if we can
be," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this
week. Although the U.S. still worries that the Soviet economy
isn't yet in a position to absorb much aid, Mr. Fitzwater
said Moscow's stance in the Gulf crisis, "clearly moves us in
the direction of being more helpful."
   Mr. Gorbachev has some other cards to play apart from the
Gulf. Two arms-control agreements, one on strategic nuclear
forces and one on conventional weapons, are supposed to be
signed later this year. But the negotiations in Geneva and
Vienna have been going slowly in recent weeks, bogged down by
technical details. Some Western analysts in Moscow say that a
pledge of U.S. aid would increase the Kremlin's good will and
help speed up the conclusion of the talks.
   The Helsinki summit should also provide both presidents
with the opportunity to sketch out their ideas for future
arrangements to safeguard world peace.
   U.S. officials say much of Mr. Bush's focus will be on a
new theme emerging in Washington that Saddam Hussein has
unwittingly forced the superpowers and others to start
constructing the post-Cold War world order. Mr. Bush is
convinced that collective action, involving both the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R., can squelch strongmen like Saddam Hussein, not
only in the Mideast but elsewhere, the officials say.
   Such thinking is likely to strike a chord in Mr.
Gorbachev, who has long argued for collective steps to
strengthen international security. But here too, there are
differences. Mr. Gorbachev favors making as much use as
possible of the United Nations. The U.N. played an important
role in the Gulf crisis, approving sanctions against Iraq and
the use of force to implement them. But Secretary of State
James Baker said this week the U.S. would prefer to avoid a
U.N. military command in the Gulf, an idea the Soviets have
advanced.
   Instead, Mr. Baker floated the idea of setting up a
permanent Mideast regional "security structure" to keep the
peace. This would house the small residual American force
that the White House envisions staying on when the Gulf
crisis abates, and possibly a Soviet component. U.S.
officials say Mr. Bush may seek Mr. Gorbachev's reaction to
the idea in Helsinki.
   For their part, the Soviets have again raised the idea of
holding an international Mideast conference to sort out
regional issues such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon
and the fate of the Palestinians, as well as the Kuwait
crisis.
   The Soviets deny that they are seeking to link the Gulf to
other Mideast regional problems, as Iraq proposes.
Nonetheless, Israel continues to reject the idea of an
international conference, and Washington is cool to the idea.
