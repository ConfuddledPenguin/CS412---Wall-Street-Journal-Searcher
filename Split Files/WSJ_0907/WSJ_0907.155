   A.L. Laboratories Inc. of Fort Lee, N.J., a generic drug
maker, said it secured a two-year, $220 million
acquisition-financing commitment from a group of 11 European
banks led by Union Bank of Norway.
   Funds drawn will be unsecured, and A.L. Labs, which is
about 50%-held by Apothekernes Laboratorium AS of Oslo, can
repay them over as long as 10 years at interest rates based
on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the interest
rate that the most credit-worthy international banks dealing
in Eurodollars charge each other for large loans.

   A.L. Labs's president and chief executive officer, I. Roy
Cohen, said the credit gives the company "substantial
flexibility" in its effort to reach $1 billion of revenue by
2000. A.L. Labs had first-half net income of $6.1 million, or
54 cents a share, on revenue of $134.2 million. "At any given
time, we are looking at several" possible acquisitions "in
pharmaceuticals and animal health," he said, but for now,
"There is no specific acquisition {coming} to fruition."
