   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Canada's Belzberg family
sold at a loss its 5.16% stake in Britain's Asda Group PLC on
the London Stock Exchange.
   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed, and officials with
Belzberg flagship First City Financial Corp., the
Vancouver-based holding and investment concern through which
the family acquired the Asda stake, weren't available for
comment.

   But the paper loss -- excluding carrying and related
charges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates -- is
believed to be around US$45 million, based on an analyst's
estimate previously confirmed by First City.
   The loss marks the latest in a string of investments that
turned sour for First City, including its 11.7% stake in
Armstrong World Industries Inc., which the company sold May
31 at a net estimated loss of $13.6 million.
   Last week, First City reported a first-half loss of 27.7
million Canadian dollars (US$24 million), or 53 Canadian
cents a share, on revenue of C$436 million, compared with
prior-year net before extraordinary items of C$58.9 million,
or C$1.07 a share, on revenue of C$456 million. A special
gain made net last year C$182.6 million, or C$3.32 a share.
   First City said that the stake in Asda, a big retailer,
wasn't an "appropriate long-term investment" and it would
like to emphasize its financial services, manufacturing and
real estate operating companies.
   First City sold the bulk of its holdings to a group of
institutions, according to brokers in London. At last report,
First City held about 65 million Asda shares.
   In London Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Asda's shares
closed at 109 pence (US$2.07) each, down 3.5 pence. First
City acquired its Asda shares at an average price of about
#1.50, according to a report by Toronto's First Marathon
Securities Ltd. that was later confirmed by a First City
executive.
   Tony McNeary, an analyst with London's County NatWest
Securities, predicted that with the Belzbergs gone, Asda's
share price "will remain there (at 109 pence) for a while and
probably won't motor back up."
