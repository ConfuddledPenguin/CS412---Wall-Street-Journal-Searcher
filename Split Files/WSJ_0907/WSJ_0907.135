   JIDDAH -- Saudi Arabia's King Fahd pledged to pay
"billions of dollars" to help cover the bill for the
world-wide effort to defend Saudi Arabia and force Iraq out
of Kuwait.
   According to U.S. and Saudi officials, the oil kingdom
told an American delegation led by Secretary of State James
Baker that it will devote much of the enormous oil-price
windfall it has received since Iraq invaded Kuwait to
offsetting the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis to the U.S.
and other nations.

   "There was a meeting of the minds," a Saudi official said.
"The {U.S.} administration will not be disappointed in what
Saudi Arabia is willing to do." A U.S. official described the
Saudi offer as "a very, very substantial commitment."
   Neither country's officials would put a figure on the
agreement, but U.S. officials have generally confirmed
reports that the Bush administration had been hoping the
Saudis would supply about $4 billion over the next year to
poor countries hurt by the embargo and about $500 million
monthly toward meeting the added U.S. defense costs resulting
from the Gulf crisis. The Pentagon expects the Gulf operation
to cost it an extra $6 billion through 1990.
   The U.S. officials also said several smaller Gulf states
have agreed to contribute funds as well. Administration
officials said they are hoping Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates together will cover most of the
Pentagon's extra costs for the Gulf operation through 1990.
   Mr. Baker will visit with leaders of Kuwait and the UAE
today as part of a 10-day trip to countries in the Persian
Gulf region and northern Europe. Besides seeking financial
commitments to pay for the anti-Iraq effort, he is working to
build further diplomatic momentum for the drive. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady is leading a similar mission to a
separate list of countries.
   As part of its drive, the U.S. is asking European
Community nations to contribute as much as $2.5 billion. EC
foreign ministers, meeting in Rome tomorrow, are expected
tentatively to approve aid to poorer nations in the region,
but it's less certain they will contribute cash to defray the
costs of the U.S. military deployment.
   The Saudi contributions to the anti-Iraq effort will go
into two separate funds. One will provide aid to poor Moslem
countries -- especially Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- which are
suffering from the world-wide embargo of Iraq. The second
will be used to provide monthly payments to the U.S., in cash
or in kind, to help underwrite the U.S. troop deployment
here.
   American officials said King Fahd made explicit an earlier
promise to cover all of the costs incurred by the U.S. for
stationing the massive force on Saudi territory. Among the
items to be covered would be fuel, transport and water. In
addition, the Saudis may cover other costs, and may make
transfers to the U.S. Treasury, according to U.S. officials.
They aren't expected to cover the initial costs of organizing
the deployment, though.
   The Saudis could use a variety of mechanisms other than
direct payments to reimburse the U.S. For example, U.S.
officials said the Saudis might pay other U.S. financial
commitments to offset the military spending. But the
officials wouldn't elaborate and insisted such details remain
to be decided.
   Administration economic officials traveling with Mr. Baker
carried detailed estimates of Saudi oil revenue, which one
official characterized as "a very big number." Assuming
average prices have risen about $10 a barrel since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, Saudi Arabia would be taking in $50 million
or more in added daily revenue on its pre-existing
production, not counting the extra two million barrels a day
it has promised to pump. That tops the cost of the U.S.
military operation here.
   U.S. officials said the financial agreement took up only a
small portion of Mr. Baker's meeting with King Fahd and two
companion sessions with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince
Saud al-Faisal Al Saud.
   The Americans said that Saudi leaders are interested in
exploring the nascent U.S. idea for a regional security
system in the Persian Gulf. And they said the Saudis reported
a decided swing in Arab public opinion against Iraq. The
officials said that no new anti-Iraq measures were planned
during the meeting, and that Saudi Arabia sought no new
commitments from the U.S.
