   The nation's airlines may be running out of computer power
on the days when travelers need it most -- right in the thick
of fare wars.
   Last week, the industry's reservation systems nearly
crashed under the burden of a deluge of travelers trying to
book discount fares. After initially insisting the incident
was just a fluke, industry officials now concede that such
outages -- which can cripple the travel plans of millions --
may well recur on peak demand days, when airlines set
deadlines for their best discounts.

   Though most travelers know little about them, the computer
systems are virtually the lifeblood of the airline industry.
The computers, among the most complex and largest in the
world, are tapped into more than 100 million times a day by
travelers and travel agents seeking flight and fare
information and processing tickets. If they aren't working
properly for even brief periods, the entire travel industry
can be thrown into pandemonium.
   "The systems are really what give people access to the
airline transportation system," says Theodore Harris, a
travel consultant in McLean, Va. "Take that access away, and
you've got chaos."
   The outage on Aug. 29, for example, deprived thousands of
travelers of a special fare discount that expired that day.
It tied up airline phone lines for hours and forced many of
the nation's 35,000 travel agencies to work through the night
writing tickets.
   To a large degree, the mounting strain is a result of the
travel boom of the 1980s. Airline boardings have more than
doubled since airline deregulation, and the number of travel
agencies has tripled in 10 years. They provide far more
services that strain the reservation systems, such as 24-hour
fare check and pre-boarding passes. And because fare
discounts are so widespread, many new travelers price-shop
continually -- which further taxes the reservation systems.
   But airlines are also responsible for the strain because
they set up the mind-boggling fare system that prompts
travelers and agencies to price shop. The industry changes
domestic fares more than 200,000 times each day, so a $99 New
York to Miami fare may be available one minute but gone the
next.
   Critics say the airlines may have planned inadequately for
the growth in travel demand, in part because they enjoy a
near-monopoly status over the reservation system. Currently,
four systems dominated by six U.S. carriers process virtually
all U.S. airline reservations.
   "They can live with having an occasional outage when they
know they have little competition," says Michael E. Levine,
dean of Yale's School of Organization and Management and a
former top official for the Civil Aeronautics Board. "But
they might think twice if they had thought they'd lose
customers."
   The functioning of the reservation systems has
implications beyond travel, since the airlines have long led
the way in solving the most complex problems of commercial
computing. Technology originally used by airlines has rippled
into many other industries that handle complex transactions
at dizzying speeds, including banking, retailing and
insurance. As these industries accelerate their automation,
they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the kind of
business disruption the airlines faced last week.
   That disruption was fueled by a rush of travelers trying
to buy some leisure fare discounts that expired on Aug. 29,
as well as to avoid a 5% fuel surcharge that went into effect
the next day. Airlines initially said their systems didn't
come close to crashing, but they now concede that some
computers shut down or were brought down because of the
overload.
   At the nation's largest reservation system, American
Airlines' Sabre, the computers came so close to crashing that
a quarter of the system -- or about 12,000 terminals at
travel agents, airports and reservations centers across the
country -- had to be shut down for up to half an hour to
store up more power. "What we had was like a brown-out
situation," says Max Hopper, American's senior vice president
of information systems. Another major system, System One,
said its main computer -- which handles 40% of its
transactions -- shut down and had to be restarted because of
the crunch.
   Airlines stress that they can easily handle the
reservation load on normal days and that the circumstances on
Aug. 29 -- two fare deadlines -- were somewhat unusual. But
"with the way the industry is growing, it can definitely
happen again," says Bill Mowery, a senior consultant for
System One, a unit of Continental Airline Holdings Inc.
   In fact, the industry has already suffered other, smaller
overloads in the past year and a half. Sabre went on the
blink for 12 hours last year because of a software failure.
That crippled the operations of 14,000 agents that subscribe
to Sabre and forced the airline to operate with little
information about booking and seating.
   Airlines say they could avoid future bottlenecks by
beefing up their artillery of computers. But most carriers
are reluctant to make big investments to prevent rare
outages; just one mainframe computer for a reservation system
can cost more than $10 million. "We have the capability to
prepare for any crunch," says Mr. Mowery, "but it may not be
something we want to pay for."
   Some critics also think the systems would run more
smoothly if they were in the hands of independent outsiders.
A bill before Congress would require airlines to sell off
their reservation systems.
   Yale's Mr. Levine has also suggested that the industry
could make its system more flexible by giving travel agents
access to all four major reservation computers. Currently,
airlines essentially force most agents to use one system at a
time, and charge the agents per transaction. These and other
fees can be quite lucrative; Sabre had a 27% operating profit
margin in 1988, the last year for which figures are
available, while the airline's profit margin was only 9%.
   "We're talking about a cash cow here, and the airlines
don't want to give that up," says Hal Hensley, a Dallas-based
management and data processing consultant.
