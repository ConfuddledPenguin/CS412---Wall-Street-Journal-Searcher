   SEOUL, South Korea -- Senior officials from the Group of
Seven industrialized countries will meet in Paris Monday and
Tuesday to discuss the dollar's recent decline and to review
developments in the world economy, a U.S. Treasury official
said.
   The meeting comes at a time when the economic slowdown in
the U.S. has pushed the value of the dollar down sharply
against foreign currencies. The dollar-yen exchange rate, for
instance, is at its lowest level this year. The officials
will have to decide whether any action is needed to stem the
dollar's decline.

   Such a gathering of the G-7 deputies is usually held prior
to the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, which this year are scheduled to take place in
Washington in late September.
   The G-7 officials also will attend so-called "working
party three" meetings of the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 24 rich
nations, the Treasury official said. The OECD working group
meets regularly to discuss the international economy.
   During the two sets of Paris meetings, officials are
expected to review the impact of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait on oil prices and other recent economic developments.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is here leading a U.S.
delegation on a whistlestop to raise contributions in support
of the American-led military effort in the Persian Gulf and
for Mideast countries -- particularly Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey -- whose economies have been badly harmed by the
Persian Gulf crisis. Western officials say the United Nations
trade embargo against Iraq will be more effective if those
three countries get $3.5 billion of economic assistance.
   The G-7 countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
