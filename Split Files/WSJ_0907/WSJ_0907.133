   Damn the recession fears, full speed ahead.
   That seems to be the attitude of several entrants in this
column's stock-picking contest. Generally, they aren't opting
for the usual haven stocks such as food and tobacco. Instead
the entrants are looking for low-priced growth stocks --
shares that they think will show rising earnings but that
aren't too expensive.

   "I like this kind of environment," says Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "A lot of the
stocks I like that had gotten too pricey now have been kind
of bruised and battered" in the market's decline since
mid-July. For the six months through Aug. 31, the
contestants' only big winner was American Film Technologies
Inc., best known as a colorizer of black-and-white films. The
stock gained 29.8% after Jonathan Steinberg recommended it in
March.
   That gain helped four market professionals eke out a 2.5%
advance for the six months, beating the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which declined 2.3%. The pros also bested a randomly
selected Dartboard Portfolio, chosen by a toss of darts at
the Journal's stock pages. The Dartboard stocks fell more
than 14%. Since the contest adopted its current rules
featuring a six-month measurement period, the pros have
defeated the darts three times in a row.
   Mr. Steinberg, publisher and editor in chief of Individual
Investor magazine in New York, doesn't recommend American
Film Technologies any longer for most investors, although he
thinks it still has some speculative appeal as a takeover
candidate. For the coming six months, he suggests Dell
Computer Corp.
   Based in Austin, Texas, Dell makes personal computers that
are clones of International Business Machine Corp.'s desktop
machines. Dell sells the computers by mail and telephone
solicitation, and has a telephone service staff that Mr.
Steinberg regards highly.
   Mr. Steinberg believes Dell is staging "almost an
unspotted turnaround." Earnings gained almost threefold in
1990's first six months on a 37% sales rise. Wall Street
generally expects Dell to earn about 99 cents a share in the
year ending in January 1991. But Mr. Steinberg thinks $1.15
to $1.20 is realistic.
   A week ago, Dell came out with "a slew of new product
launches and add-ons," Mr. Steinberg says. "They are really
upgrading their product line." At yesterday's closing price
of $11.625, the stock is selling for 10 times Mr. Steinberg's
earnings estimate. He thinks Dell could hit $17 within six
months.
   Mr. Johnson finished second for the past six months, with
a 4.6% gain in Hanson PLC, a big British company active in
such businesses as mining, batteries, cement, tobacco and
chemicals. "It's my kind of stock," he says. Investors who
are willing to tolerate "a snail's pace will get good
returns."
   Mr. Johnson's new pick is Boeing Co., the Seattle airplane
maker, which he says has "successfully made the transition
from mostly defense to mostly commercial aviation." The
company's order backlog is "in excess of $90 billion," or
roughly three times annual sales, he says, and its profit
margins are improving.
   Mr. Johnson thinks he's being "conservative" in estimating
that Boeing's earnings will grow 18% to 20% a year for the
next three years; he predicts profits of about $4 a share
this year and $5 a share next year. With the stock at $47.25,
it is selling for less than 10 times his prediction of 1991
earnings.
   Two new investment professionals join the
stick-your-neck-out brigade this month. Kathleen Millard
manages some $400 million in the Equity Income Fund for
private banking clients of Chase Manhattan Bank. David Katz
is chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. in
New York.
   Ms. Millard likes Baxter International Inc., a hospital
supply company in Deerfield, Ill. Compared with rivals
Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott Laboratories, Baxter's earnings
have lagged in the past few years. "The company basically got
too fat" after it acquired American Hospital Supply, Ms.
Millard says.
   But in March Baxter announced a restructuring program that
will close a fifth of the company's 100 plants world-wide,
cut 10% of its work force, and shed some marginal businesses.
Right now, Baxter earns a return of about 10% to 12% on
stockholders' equity, Ms. Millard says. She believes it can
improve that performance by about one percentage point a year
until Baxter achieves the 15% to 17% returns its major rivals
earn.
   Meanwhile, Baxter sells for less than 14 times estimated
1990 earnings, while Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott have been
selling at a multiple of more than 17. Ms. Millard would pay
as much as $26 a share for Baxter, which closed at $23.50
yesterday. Her target is $32 to $36 within a year.
   Mr. Katz favors Handleman Co., a distributor and
wholesaler of home entertainment products such as videotapes,
audio tapes and compact disks. It specializes in serving
large retailers such as K mart.
   "The stock is very emotional. Either people love it or
they hate it," says Mr. Katz. Right now they're closer to
hating it. By several measures (such as the stock's price
relative to earnings, and the price relative to book value),
"you are catching it at its historic lows" for the past eight
years, Mr. Katz says. "You are able to buy a dominant player
in a growth industry at an excellent price. The market
absolutely holds in disdain any company with uncertainty."
   One reason for the bargain: earnings in fiscal 1990 (ended
in April) declined to $1.13 a share, from $1.28 a share the
year before. Returns of some videotapes (including "Batman"
movies) were higher than expected, and the company was left
holding some uncollected debts when Ames Department Stores
got into financial trouble.
   But Mr. Katz expects Handleman to bounce back and earn
$1.30 to $1.35 a share this fiscal year. The stock closed
yesterday at $11.25. Says Mr. Katz: "We are buyers up to
about $13."
   For the next six months, the pros' selections will compete
against a Dartboard Portfolio consisting of AmBase Corp.,
Chili's Inc., Coachmen Industries Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd.
