   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said it will restructure
its European operations to better position itself for the
single European Community market planned for 1992.
   The British chemical and pharmaceuticals company said the
restructuring will involve creating a new Brussels-based
organization, ICI Europe, to oversee ICI businesses
throughout the 12-nation community and a few other European
countries. Six regional groupings of ICI's European
operations will replace the current 15 national ones.

   Tom Hutchison, the company's executive director
responsible for Europe, said the move is aimed at cutting
costs and providing better customer service. The company
didn't give any figures on how much it hopes to save and how
many jobs might be eliminated. It said it hopes job losses
will be minimal, considering the further growth it expects in
Europe.
   Mr. Hutchison said ICI's many acquisitions in Europe
during the 1980s left the company with new units that aren't
well integrated into the corporate structure. "We need to
realign and simplify our organization," he said.
   The new structure, to be in place by 1992, would eliminate
current anomalies such as having three ICI companies selling
the same products on the same market, sometimes even to the
same customer, Mr. Hutchison said.
   The move is unlikely to have a major effect on the
company's profitability, according to Richard Henderson, an
analyst at Nomura Securities in London. Mr. Hendersen called
the reorganization "a step in a very sensible direction" that
will transcend national boundaries where necessary or logical
and that should "shake up" the company's large bureaucracy.
