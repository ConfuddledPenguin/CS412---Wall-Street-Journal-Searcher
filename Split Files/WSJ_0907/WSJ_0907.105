   WASHINGTON -- President Bush cleared the way for the
approval of "most favored nation" treatment for imports from
Czechoslovakia, and asked Congress to approve a bilateral
trade agreement with the country.
   The White House announced that the president has decided
to approve a waiver of the so-called Jackson-Vanik
restrictions in the 1974 trade act to permit extension of
U.S. tariff concessions to Czechoslovakian imports.

   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz said the Bush
administration hopes Congress will approve the waiver and the
trade accord before adjourning later this year.
   Both the trade agreement and waiver must be approved by
Congress before the U.S. can reduce its import duties on
products from Czechoslovakia. The approval would make that
country eligible for the same type of most favored nation
treatment given to imports from many other nations.
