   Tokyo stocks posted conservative losses in thin activity
Thursday. The Nikkei Index dropped under arbitrage selling
and short-term profit-taking, but then partially recovered on
Japanese brokerage house-driven buying, traders said.
   In London, shares closed sharply lower and at the day's
worst levels in a market still worried about the Middle East
and swayed by a weak opening on Wall Street.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues fell 266.43
points to 23811.91.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index skidded another 314.03
points to close the morning session at 23497.88, its lowest
level this year.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
380 million shares, off slightly from 397.5 million shares
Wednesday.
   Decliners widely outpaced advancers 702 to 252, while 133
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 14.05 points, or 0.76%, to 1846.03.
   The second section index fell 54.21 points, or 1.48%, to
3613.35. Volume in the section was estimated at 5.4 million
shares, compared with 5.9 million shares Wednesday.
   Stocks opened on a firmer note, based on a technical
rebound from the Nikkei's past three days of losses, traders
said.
   But reports about a U.S. citizen being shot and injured in
Kuwait City by an Iraqi soldier while trying to avoid capture
ignited selling on the futures indexes.
   Although cash stocks were slower to slide, prices began to
follow futures lower. As the bond market began to stabilize
late in the morning, however, traders began to write off the
report as not signaling imminent war and eased selling
pressure.
   Throughout the day, traces of incentive-backed buying and
further speculative interest mainly by individuals and
dealers gave support to the market, traders said. But
profit-taking checked gains.
   Particularly during the afternoon session, steady
arbitrage selling by major foreign and domestic brokerage
houses brought the Nikkei down about 450 points on the day.
   But toward the end of the session, at least one of the Big
Four Japanese securities firms was enthusiastically buying
both cash and futures, sources said, in an attempt to support
the market and entice investors into believing that prices
were near bottoms.
   The Nikkei index has now fallen 2166.46 points, or 8.34%,
since last Friday, traders noted.
   But on the other hand, the market is still overvalued when
considering price-earnings ratios, while the volatile,
shortterm nature of the market hasn't changed, noted traders
including Kevin Haag at Nomura Securities.
   "The thing we don't need right now are rumors upsetting a
very nervous market already upset for domestic reasons,"
added Brian Tobin, deputy general manager of Japanese equity
sales at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan).
   Warburg is looking at a realistic bottom for the Nikkei
somewhere from 20000 points to 23000 points, Mr. Tobin said.
He added that "any sort of retreat below 23000 points will be
a managed and organized retreat."
   "The low volume attests to the fact that shares are not
being dumped. The strategic institutional investor is sitting
back, waiting for things to fall in line," Mr. Tobin said.
   In the meantime, the Nikkei apparently has found
short-term, psychological support at 23500 points, as
intraday lows over the past three weeks haven't yet fallen
below 23547 points, posted Aug. 24, traders said. Thursday's
intraday low was at 23620 points.
   Higher Thursday were incentive-backed or speculative
shares such as Sumitomo Metal Mining, up 200 yen to 1570 yen
(up $1.41 to $11.09). The company said Wednesday that it had
discovered a gold mine in Japan.
   Also sharing the spotlight were Mitsui Mining, up 25 yen
to 960 yen, and Dowa Mining, up 99 yen to 769 yen.
   Nippon Light Metal was fueled by brokerage house buying
interest, traders said. It closed at 1310 yen, up 80 yen.
   Kurabo rose 130 yen to 1,850 yen.
   High-technology, blue-chip shares were lower. Sony fell
140 yen to 6950 yen, Pioneer dropped 140 yen to 4760 yen, TDK
dropped 230 yen to 5460 yen, and Kyocera tumbled 310 yen to
7090 yen.
   In London, although there was scattered buying, the
support was far from enough to satisfy the needs of market
makers who cut prices in hopes of drawing interest. Late in
the day, losses in New York added to the bearish mood.
   "If Wall Street closes lower it will trigger the Japanese
market and we'll be on a merry-go-round," one trader said.
   An announcement by the Bank of England that it wouldn't
alter U.K. interest rates for seven days created uncertainty
in the money markets, one trader said. With doubts cast on
the possibility of an imminent interest-rate cut, fears of
recession have been revived and stocks lost yet another
reason to recover, he said.
   "Downgradings of any recession-sensitive stocks are
prompting a large amount of selling," another trader said.
"Stockbrokers are selling very hard indeed," he added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index dropped
31.3 points to 2120.9, which was the day's low. The Financial
Times 30 Share Index closed down 32.3 points at 1639.9.
Volume was inflated to 515.5 million shares by a 64 million
share placing in Asda PLC. The stock fell 3 1/2 pence to 109
pence (7 cents to $2.08).
   Among a host of companies reporting earnings, Reckitt &amp;
Colman posted a 15% rise in pretax profit on strong
continental European and Latin American earnings, prompting a
20 pence rise to #11.59.
   Oil company results were in line with market expectations.
Burmah Oil net gained 3.7%, reflecting increased profit in
lubricants and fuels. Nevertheless, the share price dropped 9
pence to 506 pence as the company's big downstream exposure
continued to worry investors.
   At Enterprise Oil, an oil producer, pretax profit soared
59% because of a successful drilling program and higher
interest income. The stock gained 2 pence to 680 pence.
   Meanwhile, other European markets closed marginally lower.
South African gold stocks ended slightly higher.
   And stocks closed lower in Singapore, Taipei, Seoul and
Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and Manila, and higher in
Sydney.
