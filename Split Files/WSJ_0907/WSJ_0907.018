   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said its SFP Pipeline
Holdings Inc. unit is offering $219 million of variable-rate
exchangeable debentures, due 2010, at a price of 92% of face
amount.
   Santa Fe, a transportation and natural resources concern,
said the unit will use about half of the net proceeds to pay
a dividend to Santa Fe and will lend the remainder to Santa
Fe.

   In July, the Santa Fe unit filed a registration statement
covering the offering. Santa Fe said it will use the funds to
pay off part of its 16% redeemable senior subordinated
debentures.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is the managing underwriter of the
offering, the company said.
   Santa Fe said its newly formed unit will own all the
capital stock of Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines Inc., which is
the general partner in Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners
L.P. The partnership is one of the biggest independent U.S.
pipeline carriers of refined petroleum products.
