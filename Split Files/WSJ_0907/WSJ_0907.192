   NEWARK, N.J. -- Chase Laboratories Inc. said it began
selling the first generic version of Pfizer Inc.'s
big-selling heart medicine, Procardia.
   The action is expected to slice away some sales from one
of Pfizer's most profitable products. But analysts said
damage to Pfizer's Procardia business will be muted by
marketing techniques undertaken by the big New York-based
drug company. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, Pfizer shares fell $1.75 to $69.375.

   Chase, owned by closely held Andlinger &amp; Co. of Tarrytown,
N.Y., said it began selling yesterday a version of the drug
that is 30% to 40% less expensive than the brand sold by
Pfizer. Chase won the right to sell the generic version of
the drug, also known as nifedipine, following a protracted
legal battle with Pfizer over the validity of a nifedipine
patent that expired in 1989.
   Under terms of the legal settlement filed in federal court
in Newark, Chase will be the only company allowed to sell a
generic version of Procardia until Jan. 8, 1991. At that time
another patent covering Procardia will expire and other
generic drug companies will begin selling versions of the
drug.
   Procardia had sales of about $420 million in 1989. But
last year Pfizer began marketing Procardia XL, which the
company markets as safer, more effective and less expensive
than Procardia. Mark Mayer, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, said Procardia XL sales may rise to $300 million
this year as doctors switch from Procardia.
   Chase officials said they expect to generate sales of $20
million to $25 million in 1990 selling their brand of
Procardia, but analysts said competition from other generic
products and from Procardia XL may sharply reduce Chase's
nifedipine revenue in 1991.
