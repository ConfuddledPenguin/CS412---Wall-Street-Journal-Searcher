   A company declaring a stock split usually hopes to boost
its shares by making them seem more affordable. But a recent
split hasn't done a thing for Compaq Computer.
   The personal computer maker, long a Wall Street favorite,
split 2-for-1 in early July. The shares were above a
split-adjusted 61 1/2. But as the weeks rolled by and both
Dean Witter and Oppenheimer &amp; Co. lowered their opinions to
"hold" from "buy," the stock has plummeted 34%, to 45 1/2.

   Technology stocks are always prone to zigzags, of course,
and the Mideast crisis is reason enough for a drop. But that
alone doesn't explain what's been happening to Compaq. Last
Friday, for instance, the Houston Chronicle reported that
some of Compaq's notebook-sized laptop computers were
developing hairline cracks after brief use.
   It was a blow for quality-conscious Compaq, which says
this is the first widespread defect it has ever had in a
product it shipped to market. Word of the potentially
damaging report even reached Benjamin C. Rosen, Compaq's
chairman, on the golf course.
   "The cracked cases are an old story," insists Daniel C.
Benton, a Goldman Sachs analyst. A similar report surfaced
six months ago. Yet a Compaq spokeswoman doesn't blithely
shrug off the story. "We originally believed it was just one
lot," she says, "but now we're not so sure."
   Houston-based Compaq took another hit Wednesday, as
semiconductor analysts lowered estimates for chip companies
and cited a slowdown in demand for chips from personal
computer makers.
   Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been projecting
profit of $5 a share for this year, up from a split-adjusted
$3.88 a share in 1989. They have continued to recommend the
shares. Edmund Spelman of Oppenheimer thinks their
projections may be "too aggressive," however, and consensus
per-share estimates by analysts are $4.66 for 1990 and $5.53
for 1991, according to Thomson Financial Networks.
   Analysts continue to praise the company's management and
high-performance product line. A question mark is Systempro,
an important and costly new class of computer for business
users announced last fall. "A lot of earnings projections are
pegged to Systempro sales," says analyst Eric C. Zimits at
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes.
   Compaq has said it expected to sell only a few thousand
units in the first year, and is right on target so far. Yet
some analysts conditioned by Compaq's past triumphs expected
much more, perhaps as many as 25,000 sold by year end. "The
Systempro makes Wall Street nervous," says Rick Martin of
Prudential-Bache.
   Compaq also now faces serious price competition from Dell
Computer, an Austin, Texas, mail-order computer firm with a
modest following in data-processing circles.
   Last week, Dell announced two Systempro lookalikes,
including a high-end 425TE that runs about $12,000 compared
with Compaq's Systempro at $17,000 or higher. Speculation
persists that International Business Machines soon will
announce a powerful personal computer much like Systempro and
priced competitively.
   Once Systempro stirred concern on the Street, ghosts began
looming around every corner. Analysts even fretted about
Compaq's 21% share of Conner Peripherals after word spread
that disk-drive maker Quantum Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.,
would soon offer a drive that could erode Conner's market
share.
   Some analysts also brood about a laptop that IBM is said
to be introducing to challenge Compaq's best-selling Compaq
LTE. Although Oppenheimer's Mr. Spelman says "IBM's bark is
usually worse than its bite" in the personal computer market,
he believes IBM has finally "gotten its act together" and
could pose a threat.
   Compaq is expected to score points with a new laptop of
its own in the next few weeks. Enthusiasm for that
introduction has been tempered by concern over an onslaught
of Japanese competition. "The {profit} margins on laptops are
going to be coming down," predicts Eugene G. Glazer of Dean
Witter Reynolds.
   Foreign markets have been a bragging point for Compaq in
recent years. Yet one analyst believes that a seasonal
third-quarter slowdown in European sales will hit Compaq
harder this year than in the past; it got 45% of 1989 sales
from Europe, compared with 39% a year earlier.
   Analysts' misgivings come in the midst of a slowing U.S.
computer market, which does little to soothe Wall Street's
itchy trigger fingers. "The PC business is headed into a
period of restructuring that will last a number of years,"
says Mark D. Stahlman, analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons.
