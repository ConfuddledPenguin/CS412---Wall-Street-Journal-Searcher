   Thames Television PLC of Britain, a broadcasting concern,
reported that pretax profit for the six months ended June 30
fell 34% to #10.3 million ($19.6 million) from #15.7 million
a year earlier, damped largely by sluggish advertising
revenue.
   The year-earlier half ended Sept. 30, 1989; the company
has changed to a calendar-year accounting period. Net profit
attributable to shareholders, or profit after taxes and
extraordinary items, totaled #6.59 million, a decline of
#71.1 million. Per-share earnings fell 34% to 14.5 pence from
22.1 pence.

   Sales rose 10% to #183 million from #166 million.
   The dividend is unchanged at 5.15 pence a share.
   Thames in June warned of poor interim earnings, saying
that depressed advertising revenue, new tax arrangements, and
costs relating to its $89 million acquisition of Reeves
Communications Corp. of the U.S. would weigh heavily on the
results.
   Thames said BET PLC and Thorn EMI PLC, which each own 28%
of the company, are still in the process of disposing of
their stakes. It didn't disclose further details.
