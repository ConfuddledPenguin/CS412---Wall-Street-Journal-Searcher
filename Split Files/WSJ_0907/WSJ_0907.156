   Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. said it is forming a company
to provide mergers and acquisitions advice to U.S. and
Japanese corporations.
   The new company, named Bridgeford Group Inc., will be
headed by John A. Herrmann Jr., a senior managing director in
the mergers and acquisitions department of Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.

   Bridgeford will be capitalized at $50 million. Hideo
Ishihara, deputy president of Industrial Bank of Japan, said:
"capital isn't important. IBJ itself is squarely behind
this."
   Over the past 10 years, Mr. Herrmann -- who has spent 25
of the last 29 years at Shearson Lehman or one of its
predecessor firms -- was responsible for the management of
both Shearson Lehman's international merger and acquisitions
business and its corporate sales and divestiture group.
   Besides serving Japanese companies seeking to invest in
the U.S., Mr. Herrmann said that Bridgeford would also advise
American companies seeking to penetrate the Japanese market
and would send its expertise to Industrial Bank of Japan's
merger efforts in Europe.
