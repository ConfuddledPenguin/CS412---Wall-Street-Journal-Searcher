   Ratners Group PLC waived a provision of its agreement to
acquire Kay Jewelers Inc., removing a technical hurdle to the
stock-swap deal.
   Ratners said it will no longer condition the acquisition
on the company's receiving a majority of both classes of
Kay's $150 million in junk bonds. Ratners has acquired more
than 90% of one class of bonds but only a small fraction of
the other class.

   Ratners said it expects to complete its acquisition of Kay
shortly after Kay's stockholders approve the deal in October.
   Kay, a retail jewelry chain based in Alexandria, Va., has
about 12.4 million shares outstanding. Under the agreement,
each Kay share will be swapped for a convertible preferred
share of Ratners. Ratners values the new stock at $17 a
share, although some analysts put the stock's value at $14 to
$15 a share.
