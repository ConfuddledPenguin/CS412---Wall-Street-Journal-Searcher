FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission, in an
aggressive antitrust action, charged the College Football
Association and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. with illegally
restraining competition in a five-year exclusive broadcast
contract.
   In its administrative complaint, which was expected, the
commission alleged that the contract would hinder competition
in the marketing of football telecasts and deprive viewers of
a broader selection of games to watch.

   At a news conference yesterday, FTC antitrust chief Kevin
Arquit said, "As a consequence of the contracts entered into
between ABC and the CFA, rights fees for college football
telecasts are higher, fewer games are telecast, overall
college football viewership is lower and even the selection
of games for telecast is not responsive to consumer
preference."
   The commission's complaint is the first of its sort
brought against a collegiate or professional sports
association, Mr. Arquit said. In a 1984 antitrust decision
stemming from a private lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court broke
up the National Collegiate Athletic Association's monopoly on
negotiating broadcast rights on behalf of all college teams.
   The CFA has denied any wrongdoing and said it would fight
the charges. But people familiar with the case said that
private negotiations are likely and could produce a
settlement prior to the Nov. 13 hearing scheduled before an
FTC administrative law judge.
   The FTC complaint threatens the nearly total dominance ABC
Sports would have beginning next year on national primetime
college football telecasts. In February, the CFA and Capital
Cities/ABC signed a contract, which the FTC valued at $300
million, committing 63 of the association's 66 member schools
to broadcast their Saturday afternoon games on the network
from 1991 through 1995. The FTC could seek to have the
contract voided and prohibit any other agreements that it
believes restrain broadcast competition.
   The FTC action is a product of the agency's campaign to
revive its relatively dormant antitrust bureau. During the
Reagan administration, a combination of anti-regulatory
ideology and a reduced staff crippled the commission's
antitrust efforts.
   About eight months ago, however, the FTC established a
nine-lawyer unit to scrutinize transactions that don't
involve mergers, Mr. Arquit said. The case announced
yesterday is the first from the new team to reach the
administrative complaint stage, he added.
   The CFA, which consists of most of the major collegiate
athletic conferences and 20 major independent universities,
has an exclusive broadcasting arrangement with CBS Inc. for
this year's season. Asked about the legality of that
contract, which the FTC hasn't formally challenged, Mr.
Arquit said he couldn't comment on any "possible pending
investigation."
   Capital Cities/ABC already has exclusive broadcast
contracts with the members of two major collegiate
conferences, the Big Ten and Pacific 10. Mr. Arquit also
declined to comment on the legality of those agreements.
   Lewis Engman, the CFA's lawyer, said that the association
"is not a cartel" and pointed out that "today there are
hundreds of college football games televised every season."
   An administrative complaint doesn't mean that the target
companies have acted illegally. The commission has the
authority to issue a complaint when it has "reason to
believe" that antitrust laws have been violated and that
further proceedings are "in the public interest," Mr. Arquit
said.
   The CFA and Capital Cities/ABC may appeal any ruling by
the administrative law judge to the FTC's five commissioners,
who may then reconsider the case.
