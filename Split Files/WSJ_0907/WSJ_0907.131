   BAGHDAD -- Iraq's military machine already is creaking,
because of supply problems, low morale and purges of
high-ranking officers. Nevertheless, nothing short of all-out
war is likely to dislodge Iraq's army from its position in
Kuwait, according to military analysts in Baghdad.
   However, East and West bloc analysts say time is on the
side of Iraq's enemies. Baghdad's problems are expected to
worsen significantly over the next six to nine months. "There
is no quick fix that will push Iraq out of Kuwait," says one
Western military attache.

   On paper, Iraq's military is so formidable as to make any
attack almost unthinkable. Its one million troops, 4,000
tanks, 500 combat aircraft and 1,200 missiles make up the
third- or fourth-largest military force in the world,
analysts here say. Most equipment is of comparable quality to
that of a European country, such as France.
   But Iraq's ability to maintain its forces in the absence
of foreign equipment and expertise is questionable. Iraq can
produce ammunition and some basic components, but it relies
on imported spare parts for almost all its sophisticated
weaponry. Many of its combat aircraft still are serviced by
Soviets in Iraq, and sometimes are flown back to the U.S.S.R.
for major maintenance. The Soviets say they still have 160
"specialists" under contract in Iraq to service Soviet
equipment and train Iraqis to use it.
   Analysts believe that if Iraq continues in its current
defensive posture, 30% of its materiel could be out of
operation in nine months. Any fighting or major redeployment
would cause much more rapid deterioration; at best, Iraq
could sustain a defensive war for no more than two months,
and an offensive for one or two weeks, analysts say.
   Iraq's other problems are harder to quantify. Getting
water to troops in Kuwait already is a major problem, and
food supplies are uneven as well. Dysentery is rampant in
Kuwait and southern Iraq, and there have reportedly been
cases of cholera in Kuwait.
   Morale and discipline also appear to be poor. As evidence,
analysts point to the looting of Kuwait, and two incidents
over the past year when rioting troops -- possibly members of
a Shiite Muslim cell within the Army -- led to shootings and
deaths in Baghdad. Desertion, a serious problem during the
Iran-Iraq war, also has resumed though there are no reliable
figures on the numbers who have fled into Iran, Saudi Arabia
or the southern marshes of Iraq, where many have become
highwaymen.
   Only the 140,000 "Republican guards" -- half deployed in
Baghdad and half in the Kuwaiti theater -- are regarded as a
completely reliable fighting force.
   There also are strong signs of dissension within the upper
ranks of the military. The commander of the air force and the
commander of army aviation have vanished from public view in
recent weeks, presumably because they opposed the invasion of
Kuwait. A half-dozen other high-level officers are believed
to have been jailed. "Normally," says one Western analyst,
"you don't change horses in the middle of a race."
   Continued resistance in Kuwait may be further eroding
Iraqi morale. By some estimates, 20 to 25 soldiers a day are
being treated for wounds caused by sniping and Molotov
cocktails -- usually aimed at officers. Analysts say they
have reliable reports of women driving through the streets of
Kuwait and hurling grenades out the windows. Five hundred or
more Iraqis may have been killed or wounded since the
invasion Aug. 2, they say.
   As yet, another potential problem for the Iraqi military
hasn't emerged: the Kurds. Soon after the cease-fire in its
war with Iran, Iraq turned its guns and chemical weapons on
the Kurds, who have been fighting a guerrilla war in the
north for decades. The Iraqi action decimated the Kurdish
resistance. But the north remains tense and heavily armed;
with help from foreign-supported Kurds crossing in from
Turkey, Syria or Iran, analysts say, the north could become a
low-level second front. Iraqi anxiety in Kurdistan is evident
in the fact that it retains some 200,000 troops in the north.
   If fighting does break out, analysts in Baghdad believe
heavy ground action is probably unavoidable. While the West
will eventually have massive air superiority, "you don't win
wars by bombing alone," says one analyst. Also, Iraq's
military complex is too dispersed to be destroyed in a first
strike, so there is the risk of retaliatory attacks against
Saudi Arabia and Israel.
   But most analysts in Baghdad believe Iraq's much-feared
missile program is overrated. They say there is no hard
evidence that Iraq can equip its missiles with chemical
warheads. And Iraq's 75 or so missile launchers would quickly
be detected once they started firing, making them vulnerable
to attack after only a few rounds.
   Iraq may have one other hidden weapon, though. Analysts
believe more than 2,000 Palestinian commandos have entered
Iraq for training since the beginning of the year.
Infiltrated into the large Palestinian work force in the Gulf
states, they could become a "fifth column," analysts say,
torching oil fields or sabotaging equipment. A wave of terror
against Western targets across the Middle East also "is a
good probability," he says.
