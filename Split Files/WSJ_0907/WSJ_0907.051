<LP>
   U.S. policy in the Gulf is at a critical point. President
Bush has forged an unprecedented consensus to preserve Saudi
Arabia's territorial integrity, regional stability, and the
international legal order. To secure these ends however, he
and Congress must face crucial strategic, tactical and policy
issues, including:
   -- What is the most effective and least costly way to get
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- What if the United Nations embargo does not work well
enough or soon enough?
   -- Should we accept an outcome that leaves Saddam Hussein
in place, with his weapons of mass destruction?
   -- How do we pay for the Gulf operation?
   America's success, and its international stature, will
turn on how well these and other issues are handled. Yet,
with the stakes so high and with such difficult issues to
resolve, the nation and the world -- including Saddam Hussein
-- are about to witness what has since 1973 become a needless
and destructive American ritual. Instead of focusing
exclusively on how to succeed in this historic venture,
Congress and the president are likely, because of the War
Powers Resolution, to waste valuable time on a wholly
artificial set of questions having no utility whatsoever in a
process that poses real risks to the nation's interests.
   A brief review of the likely questions should convince us
that it would be absurd to engage in a debate of Congress vs.
the president instead of the world vs. Iraq. One can only
hope that Congress is ready for the first time since the
resolution was adopted to agree to a compromise in which
neither side loses face.
                                                                                                       

   -- Did the president have legal authority to send some
100,000 armed Americans -- with planes, ships, tanks, etc. --
to the Gulf without first obtaining Congress's approval?
   Presidents have ordered the armed forces into combat many
times during the past 200 years to protect American citizens,
interests, and friendly states that request our assistance.
Section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution, however, purports
to limit the president's authority to commit forces "only
pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory
authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack
upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or
its armed forces." None of these bases for action was present
when President Bush acted, so some legislators and
commentators are certain to question the president's conduct.
                                                                                                       

   -- Did the president adequately consult with Congress?
   Section 3 of the resolution requires the president to
consult with Congress in every possible instance before
introducing U.S. armed forces into hostilities or "imminent"
hostilities. President Bush concluded that the situation was
not one in which hostilities existed or were imminent. In
fact, as he noted, sending troops reduced the possibility of
hostilities. He decided nonetheless to consult, because he
properly believes in consulting even when the resolution does
not require it. On the day troops were sent, with Congress
out of session, the president notified congressional leaders
of his plans, including House Speaker Thomas Foley, Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell and Minority Leader Robert
Dole. Additional briefings have continued, including a
marathon session for about 150 legislators.
   Despite the overwhelming support expressed by legislators
for the president's action, some have already claimed the
consultation afforded was inadequate because many more
legislators should have been contacted, and because all
should have been asked what they thought, not merely informed
of the president's decision.
                                                                                                       

   -- Was the president's report to Congress adequate?
   Section 4 of the resolution requires the president to
submit a written report to Congress within 48 hours of
introducing American forces into hostilities or imminent
hostilities; or (with some exceptions) into a foreign
territory "while equipped for combat." The president promptly
submitted a report to Congress "consistent with" the
resolution, but some will complain that the report should
have been based on the introduction of U.S. armed forces into
a situation of imminent hostilities. They will make this
claim, despite the demonstrated correctness of the
president's prediction, simply because they want to treat the
resolution's deadlines for legislative approval as having
commenced at the time the report was filed.
                                                                                                       

   -- Will the president's authority to use the armed forces
in Saudi Arabia terminate automatically, unless Congress
specifically authorizes their continued deployment?
   Congress will undoubtedly approve the president's action
by paying for it through increased appropriations, and
through resolutions of support. Indeed, the Senate on Aug. 2
adopted (97-0) a resolution commending the president for his
initial steps and urging him "to act immediately, using
unilateral and multilateral means to seek the full and
unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti
territory," and the House passed a resolution condemning the
Iraqi invasion and calling for an economic embargo against
Iraq.
   The War Powers Resolution provides, however, that the
president must withdraw all U.S. forces from any situation of
actual or imminent hostilities within 60 days (extendable to
90) unless Congress specifically authorizes continued
deployment. This provision places pressure on Congress to
authorize a deployment with an explicit reference to the
resolution, and for a specific period of time, even though
Congress will already have approved the operation in other,
legally sufficient ways, and despite the fact (as Sen.
Mitchell explained to reporters) that no one could
responsibly place a time limit on the operation at this
point.
   It should be alarming that the U.S. government should turn
to such War Powers questions at so critical a time. Yet, in
the debates that are likely to occur soon, some legislators
will claim that, unless the resolution's terms are
"enforced," Congress will lose its proper authority over
war-making. Nonsense. Congress can no more lose its enormous
power over war than it can deprive the president of his
proper authority.
   President Bush has consulted with and reported to Congress
on his actions -- not because of the resolution, but because
he believes it is proper and essential to do so under our
constitutional system. While he rejects the purported limits
on his authority contained in the War Powers Resolution, he
fully accepts the fact that he cannot act in the Gulf without
Congress's approval and support.
   If Congress were to disapprove his actions, he could not
possibly continue them, just as President Nixon could not
continue the war in Vietnam and President Ford was forced to
discontinue his efforts to prevent a communist takeover of
Angola. Congress, in short, has the power to stop the
president without the War Powers Resolution. What the
resolution purports to do is enable Congress to stop the
president and force an end to the deployment simply by
failing to act.
   What can be done? Legislative reform seems hopeless at
this point. A constructive proposal advanced two years ago by
Sens. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and John
Warner (R., Va.) got nowhere, because any change in the
resolution is regarded by some in Congress as a capitulation
to the executive. The resolution has, however, over the years
been amended in practice in several respects.
   The president is now widely assumed, for example, to have
power to commit U.S. armed forces abroad in situations not
explicitly approved in the resolution, and the resolution's
legislative veto provisions are assumed to be invalid. On the
other hand, presidents have uniformly consulted Congress and
filed reports in all situations potentially involving the use
of force, even when not required to by the resolution's
terms.
   Perhaps our leaders could craft another de facto reform by
addressing the really tough issues raised by the Gulf
operation and approving the operation without imposing
artificial deadlines or referring explicitly to the
resolution. The president could then approve Congress's
action, and affirm its role in military affairs, without
denying the resolution's validity. Any such development
should be welcome to all who want to focus on the real issues
and avoid this pointless diversion.
