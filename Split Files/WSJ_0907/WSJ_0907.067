   MONTREAL -- The Mohawk Indians who spent the summer
blockading one of the four major bridges to the island city
of Montreal, as well as Canada's only transcontinental
passenger train, with AK-47s and hand grenades have holed up
in an alcoholism treatment center on their reservation,
surrounded by Canadian troops. The 100,000 commuters who had
driven an extra two hours a day to get to work and back are
now travelling normally; Indians are no longer being burnt in
effigy by outraged suburbanites in front of the Mohawk
barricades.
   The incident that sparked the unrest -- the attempt of the
town of Oka, just west of Montreal, to build a municipal golf
course near land that Indians claimed as a sacred burial
ground -- is now almost irrelevant. What remains relevant is
the cause that incited Canada's Indians to take up arms in
the first place: resentment at the misery of their daily
lives, a misery they share with their fellow tribesmen across
the American border.

   If a television camera dared to enter the Montreal
reservation, it would record pathetic scenes of public
drunkenness and family violence set against a background of
unpaved streets, junk strewn vacant lots, abandoned store
fronts and ramshackle houses. Indians die younger than other
Canadians; while alive, they have more disease, less
education and poorer nutrition. Similar statistics could be
reeled off for U.S. Indians.
   The problem isn't money. This year, the average Canadian
Indian family will receive cash and in-kind benefits, above
and beyond those available to other Canadians, worth more
than $60,000. Undisputed Indian land holdings on official
reservations average 60 acres per family. In a claims
settlement proposal offered in April 1990 -- and rejected by
the Indian leadership in July -- each native was to receive
4,000 acres of land and $40,000]
   Because treaty Indians may cross the U.S.-Canada border
freely, many Mohawks have found lucrative careers in
smuggling. One Montreal Indian told a reporter for the
Montreal Gazette that he earns $40,000 a trip smuggling
cigarettes. Mohawk reservations have opened up casinos and
bingo halls. The Mohawk Warriors -- as the gang that controls
this trade calls itself -- will earn an estimated $50 million
this year from these activities.
   Settlements in the U.S. have been even more generous. The
U.S. Congress paid the the tiny California mission tribe at
San Luis Rey $32 million in a water rights dispute. The 5,117
member Salt River tribe of Arizona has received $60 million
to surrender its water rights.
   If all 54 million acres of reservation land in the lower
48 states were divided among all U.S. Indians, each would
have title to 36 acres. In 1971 Alaska Indians were awarded
44 million acres -- an area equal to Massachusetts, Vermont,
New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island, Maine and Connecticut
with Puerto Rico thrown in -- and $1 billion. U.S. Indians
lay claim to an additional 455,000 acres.
   But Indian economic advantages don't buy much. The
Canadian government annually provides 6,000 free new and
renovated houses (and free building lots) for natives, yet
25% of Indian households do not have sewers or septic tanks.
Despite free post-secondary education for Indians, only
18,000 young natives out of a total Indian population of
467,000 will be attending college or university this fall, a
participation rate much lower than it is for Canadians who
must pay for their tuition. Similarly, despite a $1 billion a
year socialized medicine program run just for them, U.S.
Indians are less than half as likely to live past 65 as are
other Americans.
   Natives don't stay in school; 8.5% of U.S. Indians
(compared to 3.6% of all Americans) have five years of
schooling or less; only 7.7% have a college degree or an
advanced degree (compared to the U.S. average of 16.5%). U.S.
Indians don't seek work as aggressively (their labor force
participation rate is 21% below average) nor stay at work as
tenaciously (their unemployment level is twice the average)
as do their neighbors. U.S. Indian families are 63% more
likely to be headed by a single parent; their measured money
income is only 70% of the U.S. average; and they are almost
two and one-half times more likely than non-Indians to live
below the poverty level.
   How can things go so wrong with so much money, land and
other economic resources being thrown at the problem? It's
the paternalistic reservation system, a system common to
Canada and the U.S. alike. Reservations operate on
collectivist principles. Individual Montreal Indians can't
elect their own leaders: Hereditary "clan mothers," an elite
minority with powers denied to other Indians, do it. And clan
mothers may choose those leaders only from another elite
minority, those persons whose ancestry allows them to be
chiefs. Clan mothers also call the shots for New York
Mohawks. Militant warriors rule the Montreal reservation by
force of arms, not due process.
   Nor may individual Indians own property. On reservations,
land ownership and control remains in the hands of
politicians and bureaucrats. Indian land in Canada is owned
by the federal government; the Indians have the use of it,
but may not sell. Similarly, U.S. Indian land is held in
trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Indians do not own
their land in their own names, they may not use it in the way
they think best and they may not sell and get money with
which to start businesses.
   As soon as Indians leave the reservation, their problems
dissipate. The poverty and unemployment rates of
off-the-reservation Indians in the U.S. are half of what they
are for reservation Indians. Off-reservation American Indians
are 52% more likely than their reservation brethren to earn
more than $20,000; the percentage with high school degrees is
33% higher and the percentage with telephones is 80% greater.
   The solution for Indians' problems, in other words, is the
same as it is for Eastern Europe's: End reservation
collectivism, privatize the land (perhaps distributing it by
lottery), distribute all remaining cash settlement money to
individuals, cash out to individual Indians the present value
of all special welfare programs, institute democratic
elections with the same rules for representative government
by which the rest of us live and grant Indians full and equal
citizenship, with the same rights and responsibilities as all
other Canadians or Americans. Indian bosses and bureaucrats,
"clan mothers" and armed thugs may not like it, but this
would emancipate Indians from an economic and political
system that doesn't work, and admit them to one that does.
