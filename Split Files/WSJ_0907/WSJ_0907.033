   I was distressed to read your July 9 article "Genetic
Testing May Mark Some People as Undesirable to Employers,
Insurers."
   Job discrimination against people with polycystic kidney
disease is so unnecessary. It is wrong to deny a person a job
because of a genetic test for a disease that may never cause
symptoms. The individual is denied the important role of
participating in the work force and the work force is denied
the advantage of a multitalented large group of employees.

   The article mentions that this discrimination may result
before the course of the disease is determined, inasmuch as
debilitating symptoms might not even occur until a person
reaches late middle age. This is an important fact because
only 50% of people with polycystic kidney disease reach the
stage of renal failure. The advanced technologies of dialysis
and transplantation may even give those with kidney failure
the benefit of participating in the work force until
retirement.
   Since 1982, the Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation has
promoted research into the cause, cure and treatment of
polycystic kidney disease. Currently, more than a dozen major
medical centers in this country and abroad are involved in
research projects related to this disease. It is my sincere
hope that this common genetic illness will be conquered
within the decade of the '90s.
