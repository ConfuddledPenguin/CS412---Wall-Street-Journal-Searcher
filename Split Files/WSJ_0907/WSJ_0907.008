   Standard Brands Paint Co. reported a net loss for the
fiscal second quarter ended July 29, and announced the
closing of 19 Texas and California stores in order to improve
its financial position.
   The paint and home-supplies retailer posted a quarterly
net loss of $3.7 million, or 75 cents a share, versus net
income of $1.9 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales fell 8.7% to $79.9 million from $87.5 million in the
prior-year quarter.

   The results include a one-time restructuring charge of
$4.7 million, in addition to a $1 million allowance for
losses from discontinued operations. The company, based in
Torrance, Calif., closed 16 stores in Dallas, Houston, and
San Antonio, Texas, and one distribution facility, as well as
three California stores in Merced, Chico and Redding.
   For the six months, Standard Brands reported a net loss of
$4.9 million, or $1 a share, versus net income of $3.5
million or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 6.4%
to $152.6 million from $163 million a year ago.
   Stuart D. Buchalter, chief executive officer, said the
closed Texas properties have an estimated value of $20
million, and proceeds from their sale will be used to pare
down Standard Brand's long term debt of $150 million. The
company still plans to open eight stores in California,
Nevada and Arizona over the next year. It also plans to open
three branches of its Art Stores in California.
