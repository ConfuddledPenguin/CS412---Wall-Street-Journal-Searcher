   MAN AG of West Germany, an engineering concern and vehicle
maker, said in a preliminary report that its group profit for
the year ended June 30 rose 25% to 320 million marks ($205.2
million) from 254 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales increased 11% to 18.95 billion marks from 17.05
billion marks. Of the total, sales in West Germany rose 13%

   The board on Oct. 19 will decide on the annual cash
dividend, which was eight marks a share for the previous
year.
   MAN said new orders in fiscal 1990 were strong, rising
8.7% to 20.74 billion marks, sparked by new orders abroad,
which rose 12% to 12.6 billion marks. Domestic orders
increased 4%.
   MAN also said it plans to acquire "in the coming years"
the 20% of Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge AG that it doesn't already
own, but wasn't specific about timing. MAN last year acquired
80% of the unit from the Austrian industrial concern
Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG, which owns the remaining 20%.
