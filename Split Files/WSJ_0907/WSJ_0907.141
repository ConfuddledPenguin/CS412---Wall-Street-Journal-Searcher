   Financially-troubled Tucson Electric Power Co. said it
plans to ask the Arizona Corporation Commission later this
month for an 18-month surcharge of 2% in addition to a 10% to
12% increase in base electricity rates.
   The Tucson-based utility said it also will ask the
regulatory commission for permission to phase into its rate
base recovery of certain costs related to Unit 2 of the
Springerville Generating Station, which began operations in
June.

   The commission previously has indicated that the plant
shouldn't be included in the utility's rate base because the
plant's power capacity isn't needed, a Tucson Electric
spokesman said, adding: "We think it is needed and we are
using some power from it."
   Tucson Electric said its most recent rate increase,
11.85%, went into effect last October. The utility had
requested about a 20% increase. The previous increase was in
October 1983. Tucson Electric serves about 750,000 people in
the Tucson area.
