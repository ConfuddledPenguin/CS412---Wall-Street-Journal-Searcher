   WASHINGTON -- As soon as President Bush returned from his
vacation in Maine this week, he assembled his cabinet and
gave a brief report on the confrontation with Iraq. Then he
turned to the major business of the day: demanding that his
cabinet members switch their attention from the Persian Gulf
to the economic problems here at home.
   Moans and groans -- literally -- went up around the
cabinet room.

   Budget director Richard Darman described how the Gulf
crisis was rapidly adding billions to the nation's yawning
budget deficit. Economic adviser Michael Boskin described the
billions in growth that the crisis was shaving from the
already-anemic economy. "There weren't a lot of pleasant
surprises," says an official who attended the meeting.
   Today, the crunch will hit President Bush even harder. For
the past month, he has had something of a free ride. Congress
was on vacation. Domestic policy was on hold. Public support
surged on a wave of patriotism. But this morning,
unemployment figures will offer the first glimpse of the
economy's condition in the wake of the Mideast blowup. And
budget negotiators returning to the bargaining table will
find themselves more divided than ever as the Iraq crisis
complicates their task of cutting the deficit.
   Mr. Bush's aggressive Persian Gulf policy and the economic
mess are about to collide head-on. How he handles these
problems in the next several weeks will help determine
whether the U.S. has the resources and the will to support
its global superpower role.
   Difficult as the Iraq situation is, the problems at home
may be even more daunting. "The foreign policy area is easier
to solve, in my view, than the domestic," says Donald Regan,
the former Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff.
"The domestic economic problems are a terrible bag of worms."
   Consider:
   -- A new internal White House analysis suggests that the
Middle East crisis could push the nation's budget deficit
over the $250 billion mark next year. And that estimate may
be conservative; Rudolph Penner, an economist at the Urban
Institute who once headed the Congressional Budget Office,
thinks a tough recession could send it closer to $400
billion. Mr. Bush will personally meet with the congressional
negotiators in this morning's round of budget talks. But even
his own advisers are split over whether to be confrontational
or accommodating with Democrats in the quest for a
deficit-cutting agreement, say administration sources.
   -- America's foreign-aid budget, which already appeared
deficient for the changing world of the '90s, looks
thoroughly inadequate in light of new demands from the
Mideast showdown. The U.S. now faces multibillion-dollar
requests from its allies in the region, as well as continuing
pressure to help Eastern Europe, Latin America, and possibly
even a struggling Soviet Union.
   -- Rising oil prices continue pushing the U.S. economy
toward recession at a time when unprecedented corporate debt
and a weak financial system may make recession far more
perilous than usual. And faced with the ballooning budget
deficit, the president is virtually powerless to use federal
spending or tax policy to stimulate the economy.
   The president -- and the nation -- have much at stake.
With the Soviets facing even worse economic problems, the
U.S. has shown in the last few weeks it is the only nation
still capable of acting as a superpower in the current
crisis. But now, as Mr. Bush prepares to meet Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev this weekend, he also must show that
America can get its domestic house in order.
   "We tend to think of these things as a domestic quarrel in
a family," says Bobby Inman, a former deputy director of
Central Intelligence. "But in fact, the whole world is
watching."
   Unless Mr. Bush can score surprising success in breaking
the economic-policy deadlock, the result could be a new world
order in which the U.S. assumes the traditional superpower
role in political and military leadership, but must rely on
financial help from its friends around the world.
   Already the costs of the Mideast crisis are forcing
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State
James Baker to trek hat-in-hand across Europe and Asia
seeking help in paying for the military operation and in
aiding key allies such as Egypt and Turkey -- "an
international United Way campaign," Indiana Sen. Richard
Lugar calls it.
   Bush aides say they hope the crisis will pull together the
White House and Congress in a new resolve to quit bickering
and address budget and economic problems. But for that to
happen, the president would have to convince Congress and the
public that sacrifices are necessary, in the form of big
domestic spending cuts or tax increases.
   Will the nation emerge from the Gulf crisis with anything
more than a bigger budget deficit? "It depends on whether we
can get the administration to finally deliver bad news to the
American public, as well as good," maintains Rep. David Obey,
a Wisconsin Democrat who heads the appropriations
subcommittee that handles foreign aid.
   Like the vacationing Congress, the American public has,
for a while, given the president plenty of running room to
deal with Saddam Hussein. "This has been a short-term
political plus," says Stuart Eizenstat, who was President
Carter's domestic policy adviser. "It has boosted the
president's popularity and taken people's minds off Neil Bush
and the savings and loans and a declining economy."
   But eventually, he and others agree, the problems closer
to home will overtake the fervent support of U.S. policy in
the Mideast. "The American people have a very short attention
span," Mr. Eizenstat says. "If there's a standoff, attention
will begin to shift" to the domestic quandary.
   And the domestic problems will have been made all the
worse by the Gulf confrontation. Here is a look at these
problems, and how they may play out over the coming weeks:
                                                                                                       

   Budget Deficit
                                                                                                       

   When President Bush came into office last year, he vowed
to address the deficit. "We will not have the luxury of
taking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems,"
he said in a televised speech. But now, owing in part to the
Gulf crisis, he appears headed for deficits dwarfing even the
leviathan ones of the Reagan years.
   The direct costs of the military operation are only a
small part of the problem. Those costs, the Pentagon says,
are running about $30 million a day, and congressional budget
officials estimate the cost in the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1 at $6 billion to $8 billion.
   More troublesome are the effects on the deficit of
oil-induced economic slowing. "The prospect of going into a
recession with a $200 billion deficit is phantasmagoric,"
says Mr. Eizenstat. "We would come out of the recession with
a deficit so huge that it would stymie the ability of
lawmakers to do anything about it."
   Though White House and congressional budget negotiators
resume talks today, the Iraq crisis will make reaching a
consensus far more difficult. Mr. Darman argues that a $50
billion deficit cut next year (the official target) is more
important than ever before. Others, however, say such a big
package could cause further damage to the economy. Some
members of Congress expect a more modest package of only $20
billion to $35 billion in spending cuts and tax increases.
And House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia has launched a
campaign for tax cuts, to stimulate the sagging economy.
   Some analysts have talked of a special tax increase to pay
for the Gulf deployment, but such a tax would be a recipe for
shattering the Republicans' coalition on national security.
Some prominent GOP conservatives have been arguing that the
U.S. should stay out of the fight over Kuwait. Those same
conservatives are the party's most virulent opponents of new
taxes; they would be especially agitated over a special
Persian Gulf tax.
   The president will have to wage a mighty battle to wring
out a meaningful budget agreement. But, notes Mr. Eizenstat,
"the time and energy the administration can devote to
economic and budgetary issues right now has got to be
limited."
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Aid
                                                                                                       

   Without some radical change, Mr. Bush simply won't be able
to find enough money to help all the countries that seemingly
deserve American help now.
   His first move to aid Mideast allies came this week, when
the president asked Congress to forgive some $7 billion in
military debts owed by Egypt. That move has built up
expectations of help for others that probably will have to be
dashed.
   Turkey, which has played a critical role by shutting an
Iraqi oil pipeline, has $1.25 billion in military debts to
the U.S. that it too may want forgiven. Israel, which the
U.S. considers its most reliable Mideast ally, quickly
signaled that it wants its $4.5 billion in military and
civilian debts forgiven as well. Israel plans to seek
hundreds of millions of dollars of additional military
assistance as well, to confront the Iraqi military threat.
   And the administration already was having trouble scraping
up money to help emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and
Latin America. Six weeks ago, many in Congress thought the
defense budget could be robbed for cash to spread around to
them, cementing in place a more stable post-Cold War world.
But now slashing defense seems politically reckless.
   So the foreign-aid pie won't grow much. The House has
finished work on a $15.6 billion foreign-aid bill for next
year, a billion dollars more than this year but not nearly as
much as the U.S. could use. All told, the foreign-aid program
now is a shadow of what it was in the post-World War II
period, when the U.S. devoted 2% to 3% of its gross national
product to foreign aid. Today, it devotes less than 0.3%.
                                                                                                       

   The Economy
                                                                                                       

   Administration officials continue to predict that the
economy will narrowly escape recession, but many private
analysts are far less optimistic. In any event, the nation is
clearly facing a very sluggish period.
   For Mr. Bush, two things compound the problem. With the
deficit out of control, he has few spending or tax tools to
cushion the blow or add economic stimulus. And second, the
sorry state of the nation's financial system makes any
slowdown particularly precarious.
   For the savings and loan fiasco, rising oil prices may
turn out to be a blessing; increased oil drilling in Texas
could eventually raise the value of some of the foreclosed
property the U.S. holds.
   But in the banking community, many institutions are on the
brink of trouble. William Seidman, head of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, says the FDIC now has nearly
1,000 on its problem-bank list, quadruple the number of a
decade ago. A nationwide recession could push many of those
banks over the edge, quickly outweighing any benefits reaped
by S&amp;Ls in the Southwest.
   "In the postwar era, we've never gone into a recession
with anywhere near the same number of problem banks," says
Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution. "It means a lot
more bank failures." And bank failures, in turn, could
undermine confidence in the economy and make the recession
even deeper.
