   EL PASO, Texas -- El Paso Electric Co. said it adopted,
subject to regulatory approval, a share-purchase rights plan
under which it would declare a dividend distribution of one
share-purchase right for each common share outstanding.
   The utility said the proposed plan can't be put into
effect without prior approval from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the New Mexico Public Service
Commission, and wasn't adopted in response to any known
takeover threats.

   The rights would entitle shareholders to buy one newly
issued common share at an exercise price of $25 and are
exercisable only if a 15% or more stake in the company is
acquired or a tender offer is made.
