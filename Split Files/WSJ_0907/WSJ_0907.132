   Largely on Northeast's Loss Provisions

   WASHINGTON -- Second-quarter earnings of U.S. banks fell
24% from last year's record to $5.3 billion, largely because
Northeastern banks set aside $1.9 billion more than a year
earlier for possible loan losses, federal regulators said.
   Real estate loan problems, especially in New England,
remain the biggest drag on the earnings of the nation's
12,500 banks, said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Non-current real estate loans rose by $3.2 billion to $27.7
billion at the end of June from the end of March -- a 52%
annual growth rate. Of that increase, $3.05 billion was at
Northeastern banks. Non-current loans are loans more than 90
days past due.

   The real estate problems are also spreading to the
mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions, with delinquent-loan
growth in Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia and
North Carolina among the biggest in the country.
   But the signs of weakness that were seen the past few
quarters in the Midwest and West have faded somewhat, as such
states as California, Oregon, Utah, Kansas and Iowa
registered decreases in overdue loans. And the FDIC said it
saw signs of recovery in the Southwest, as banks there
recorded their first back-to-back profitable quarters since
1985.
   "At this point, the West is clearly looking strong," said
FDIC Chairman William Seidman. However, he said, "The
Northeast is getting worse everywhere other than
Massachusetts. Massachusetts was leading the {downward}
charge, and things appear to have leveled off there, but the
rest of New England, unfortunately, is doing its best to
catch up."
   Mr. Seidman said the outlook for bank earnings for the
rest of the year is unclear because of the potential economic
effects of the turmoil in the Middle East and mounting signs
of a recession. He said the best that could be expected would
be results similar to the second quarter, with earnings
remaining below record levels.
   The FDIC chief said the results didn't prompt him to
revise his estimate that the agency could have a loss as
large as $2 billion this year from covering insured deposits
in failed banks. However, the number of institutions on the
FDIC's list of "problem banks" stood at 1,014 at the end of
June, the lowest level since 1985.
   As in recent quarters, banks continued to pour billions
more into real estate loans despite that sector's woes. Real
estate loans in the second quarter grew by $82 billion, or
11.6%, to $803 billion from last year's second quarter. That
was the largest increase in any lending category. Real estate
loans remain the biggest single type of bank lending,
accounting for almost 30% of total bank assets.
   However, the mix of real estate lending has changed, with
banks eschewing the commercial real estate and construction
loans that have given them the biggest headaches and focusing
instead on home lending. Almost three-quarters of the $25.5
billion increase in real estate loans since the first quarter
came in residential mortgage and home equity loans. By
contrast, construction and development loans in the second
quarter fell by $823 million from first quarter.
   The key factor restraining earnings in the quarter, the
FDIC said, was banks' provisions of $6.4 billion for loan
losses, compared with $4.4 billion in the second quarter of
1989. Most of the increase came in the Northeast, where banks
set aside $1.9 billion more than a year earlier. Bank
earnings of $7 billion in the second quarter of 1989 set a
record for the second quarter.
