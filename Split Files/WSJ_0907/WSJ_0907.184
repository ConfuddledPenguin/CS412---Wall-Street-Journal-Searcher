   NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp. said it has been asked by the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision to provide a $30 million
capital infusion into its Carteret Savings Bank unit by Dec.
31. The amount is the company's remaining obligation under
the terms of its acquisition of Carteret in 1988.
   The company, which contributed $20 million in December
1989, said it anticipated the request and foresaw no problems
with fulfilling it.
