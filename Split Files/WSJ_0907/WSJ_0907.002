   WASHINGTON -- The White House said it will try to restrict
sharply the Soviet Union's commercial space launch business,
but the Commerce Department offered to help the Soviets
increase their oil production.
   The separate and seemingly contradictory moves reflect the
administration's ambivalence about aiding economic
development in the Soviet Union in the wake of the Cold War.

   The administration, which only two weeks ago for the first
time approved a plan in which Soviet rockets would be used to
launch Western satellites, issued a statement spelling out
its commercial space policy. The policy would allow Moscow to
sell rockets, but prevent it from managing actual launches.
   In coming negotiations with Moscow, the U.S. will insist
that the Soviets drop plans to launch Western commercial
satellites from Soviet launch pads; instead, Washington will
require that Soviet rockets be launched by westerners from a
single site outside the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets also would have to agree to requirements aimed
at preventing them from obtaining the technology used in the
satellites it launches. Details weren't spelled out in the
declassified version of the space policy that was made
available to the public, though.
   Further, a White House official said the administration
would set a "goal" of requiring the Soviets to sell their
launch services at market prices.
   The U.S. believes it has a strong hand in negotiating
tough conditions on Soviet launches because Washington must
give its approval for the launch of satellites using
U.S.-made parts. Nearly all communications satellites use
such parts. "We have an historic opportunity to cut a deal
{because} the Soviets are so eager to enter the market," said
a White House official.
   Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security
Policy, a conservative Washington think-tank, said the policy
would hurt U.S. rocket companies, which already face tough
competition from Arianespace, the French rocket firm. "I
wouldn't do anything to facilitate the Soviets' getting into
the market," Mr. Gaffney said. "It's a real cannard to
suggest that there's any way to insure {Soviet} services are
fairly priced."
   The administration plan would limit Soviet launches to a
proposed space port in Cape York, Australia, which would be
operated by USBI Co., a subsidiary of United Technologies
Corp. A spokeswoman for USBI, noting that the White House two
weeks ago endorsed its plan to use Soviet rockets to launch
satellites from the site, said the company expects the State
Department to issue an export license allowing it to run the
space port within a few weeks. USBI said the first launches
using Soviet rockets would take place in 1995 or 1996.
   An administration official said that the Soviets objected
during preliminary talks to the proposed U.S. restrictions.
The U.S. plans talks concerning the Soviet Union and other
space issues with the European Space Agency starting Sept.
24. Currently, several U.S. companies and Arianespace control
nearly all the world's commercial launch business.
   At the same time the White House was talking tough about
launch business, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the
U.S. is offering the Soviets technology that can help them
reverse the decline in their oil production. He said the
know-how can be provided by a number of energy-related
companies whose chief executive officers he is taking to the
Soviet Union tomorrow.
   "We're doing this for the benefit of both countries," Mr.
Mosbacher told reporters here.
   For instance, the commerce secretary said U.S. experience
in "fracturing" -- injecting certain chemicals into an oil
reservoir to increase its porosity and flow -- could be
applied to Soviet fields with potentially quick results.
   The American Petroleum Institute reports that Soviet oil
production has declined from 11.7 million barrels a day in
1987 to about 11.2 million barrels a day this year as a
result of inadequate investment and oil-field exhaustion.
   Among the energy firms represented in the U.S. business
delegation are Chevron Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Texaco
Inc., and Dresser Industries Inc.
