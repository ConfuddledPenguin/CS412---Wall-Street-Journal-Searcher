   ROME -- Italian companies' debt exposure to Iraq could
total as much as 14 trillion lire ($11.89 billion), among the
highest in the world, the Foreign Trade Ministry said.
   About half of that figure represents the debt exposure of
SACE, Italy's export-credit guarantee agency, state-owned
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Cantieri Navali Italiani
S.p.A., known as Fincantieri. The latter is part of Istituto
per la Ricostruzione Industriale, or IRI, Italy's sprawling
state holding company.

   "We are surely among the countries most exposed to the
Saddam regime, but that fact does not restrict the (Italian)
government in any way. In times like these, political
interests prevail over economic ones," Italian Foreign Trade
Minister Renato Ruggiero told participants at an Aspen
Institute conference last week in Venice.
   SACE stands to lose $1.87 billion, while BNL is owed as
much as $2.8 billion, and Fincantieri $1.32 billion.
   SACE's exposure is in potential insurance claims. A
spokesman said that almost all the claims materialize, if at
all, in two to six years.
   BNL's credits largely are the result of loans in the form
of letters of credit issued from its Atlanta, Ga., branch
that weren't authorized by the head office.
   Fincantieri's credits stem from a 1980 order to provide
Iraq with a fleet of 11 warships -- one logistical-support
ship, four frigates and six corvettes, a company spokesman
said. Fincantieri, which is based in Trieste, subcontracted
much of the work to other companies.
   Fincantieri shared 61% of the value of the 1980 contract
with Selenia-Industrie Elettroniche Associate S.p.A. and
Elettronica San Giorgio Elsag S.p.A., both of which also are
members of the IRI group. Fincantieri subcontracted 28% to
Oto Melara S.p.A. and Breda Meccanica Bresciana S.p.A., both
units of state holding company Ente Partecipa zioni &amp;
Finanziamento Industria Manifatturiera, known as Efim.
   Fiat Aviazione S.p.A. and several other private concerns
were awarded the rest of the contract.
   In 1986, Iraq paid $1.32 billion -- about half the
contractual amount -- for three ships.
   After the end of the Iran-Iraq war, Rome and Baghdad
reached an agreement in 1989 on delivery of all the ships.
But partly for bureaucratic reasons, one still sits in the
port of Alexandria, Egypt, while the other 10 are in the
Italian port of La Spezia.
   So far, the Fincantieri spokesman said, the cost of
maintenance of the ships and lost interest on the balance
have reached L150 billion.
