   ARLINGTON, Va. -- USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc., said
its August traffic rose 7.7% to 3.46 billion revenue
passenger miles from 3.21 billion a year earlier.

   The July load factor, or percentage of available seats
filled, eased to 66.6% from 66.9%.
   For the year-to-date, the airline said it flew 24 billion
revenue passenger miles, up 5% from 22.8 billion in the
year-earlier period. The load factor fell to 60.7% from
61.9%.
   USAir said statistics for 1989 periods prior to its August
1989 merger with Piedmont Airlines have been restated to
reflect the combined airline operations of both carriers on a
pro forma basis.
