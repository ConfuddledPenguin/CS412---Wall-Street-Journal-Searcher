   Fedders Corp. said it will report a loss for the second
half of 1990 because cooler-than-normal summer weather
reduced demand for air conditioners and left the company with
excess inventory.
   The Peapack, N.J., air conditioner manufacturer declined
to estimate the expected loss. Officials said, however, that
the company will be profitable for the full year. A
spokeswoman said the company will return to profitability in
the first quarter of 1991.

   Nevertheless, investors appear wary: In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Fedders shares fell
$1.75 to $7.375.
   For the second half of 1989, Fedders reported profit of
$7.4 million, or 39 cents a share; an extraordinary gain of
$1.5 million made net income $8.9 million, or 47 cents a
share. For 1990's first half, the company reported net of
$15.5 million, or 83 cents a share, on revenue of $215.9
million.
