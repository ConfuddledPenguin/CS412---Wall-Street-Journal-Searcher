   PONTIAC, Mich. -- General Motors Corp.'s struggling
Oldsmobile division is extending the new-car warranty wars to
the used-car arena in an effort to woo customers back into
dealer showrooms.
   Oldsmobile said that beginning late this year or early
next year, customers who buy selected 1984-1991 model used
cars from Olds dealers automatically will get free repairs
for 30 days, a limited one-year warranty on engine,
transmission and other major systems, and one year of free
towing or roadside service.

   Customers won't be charged for the warranty plans, Olds
officials said. Currently, used-car buyers who want such
warranty coverage must pay extra for it. Under the Olds
program, dealers will pay a fee to GM for the coverage; Olds
officials said they expect that fee will be recovered in the
prices dealers charge for the cars.
   The move is one of the broadest efforts by a major
manufacturer to extend newcar warranty protection features to
secondhand vehicles, and is a first for a GM division. The
offer highlights the growing importance of used-car sales
industrywide as new car sales continue to skid.
   A growing number of car dealers are weathering the hard
times by snapping up cars that have seen less than a year of
use in rental car fleets, and marketing them as "nearly new"
cars priced thousands of dollars less than similar "all-new"
models. (Many of the big rental-car companies also sell these
slightly used cars and offer extended warranty coverage.)
These cars increasingly are a customer's first experience
with a particular brand.
   GM alone expects to take back and resell through dealers
some 500,000 "nearly new" GM cars this year, a company
official said. That's equivalent to about 14% of GM's annual
U.S. car sales volume.
   Factory-sponsored warranties for used cars are rare in the
auto industry, but not unheard of. The U.S. sales arm of
Mercedes-Benz is offering a warranty on certain used Mercedes
cars that covers the engine, transmission and other major
systems. Mileage is unlimited, there is no deductible charge
for covered repairs, and Mercedes throws in free towing and
roadside service. The German luxury car maker first offered a
used car warranty two years ago to help dealers weather a
sales slump caused by the sharp, exchange-rate-driven
escalation of Mercedes prices.
   Olds also has good reason to take extraordinary steps to
help its dealers sell more cars, new or used. The division
expects its 3,100 dealers will sell about 500,000 new cars
for the 1990 model year that ends Sept. 30. That's barely
half the number of new Oldsmobiles sold in 1986. The dramatic
sales and market share plunge has left some 30% of Oldsmobile
dealers unprofitable this year, division officials said.
   Offering a factory warranty for secondhand cars may not
help sell new Oldsmobiles. But it "helps dealers, which helps
us sell more {new} Oldsmobiles long-term," Oldsmobile
Division General Manager J. Michael Losh said during a 1991
model briefing at GM's Orion assembly plant.
   The Oldsmobile plan is even broader than the Mercedes
offer. Under the Olds program, called Value-Rated Edge, a
customer who buys a 1984-1991 model used car -- whether made
by GM or not -- from an Oldsmobile dealer may return the car
for free repairs within 30 days, or 1,000 miles. After that,
Olds will pay for repairs to the engine, transmission and
other major parts for 12 months or 12,000 miles. A $100
deductible will be charged for each repair visit. Olds will
kick in 12 months of free towing or roadside repair service.
   Customers who buy slightly used 1990 or 1991 Oldsmobiles
will get the remainder of GM's standard 36-month, 50,000 mile
warranty coverage. But they won't have to pay the usual $100
per visit deductible under a program Olds is calling
Value-Rated Plus.
   There are several conditions to the Olds offer. Dealers
will select which used cars come with the warranty extension.
The car can't have more than 50,000 miles on it. And cars
used for commercial purposes such as taxis aren't covered.
   Oldsmobile portrayed the used-car warranty offer as an
extension of its year-old new-car warranty plan, called the
Oldsmobile Edge. That program allows buyers to return a new
Oldsmobile within 30 days or 1,500 miles and get full credit
toward the purchase of another Oldsmobile. The program was
unique in the industry at the time. However, last month,
Volkswagen AG's U.S. sales arm one-upped Oldsmobile by
offering unhappy buyers of its Passat model their money back
within 30 days or 3,000 miles.
