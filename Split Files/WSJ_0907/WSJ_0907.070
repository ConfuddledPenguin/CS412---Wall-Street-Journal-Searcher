   PERMANENT PRESENCE? The U.S. quietly lays plans to stay in
Saudi Arabia.
   Despite Saudi statements discounting a lasting U.S. role,
senior Army commanders are developing plans to permanently
station several thousand troops, along with equipment for an
even larger force that could be airlifted in. Details haven't
been approved by the White House and Saudi leaders, but many
Pentagon officials are confident the Saudis would pick up
much of the cost.

   Bush's foreign fund-raising efforts are already broader
than advertised. While the public emphasis is on scraping up
aid to Egypt and Turkey, Baker and Brady are seeking up to
$25 billion, especially in "in kind" contributions such as
jet fuel and supplies, so U.S. troops don't look like
mercenaries getting paychecks from abroad.
   Egypt considers sending thousands of more troops to
address concerns the multinational force is too American.
                                                                                                       

   BUDGET BRINKSMANSHIP grows as negotiators prepare for
weekend talks.
   As congressional leaders and White House aides gather for
talks at Andrews Air Force Base, Democrats remain divided on
whether a budget stalemate and soft economy would hurt or
help their candidates this fall. Bush could use his Tuesday
night speech to Congress to criticize them if no progress is
made.
   Meanwhile, agencies outdo each other in sketching doomsday
scenarios for Oct. 1 if no deal is reached. The FBI says it
would lay off 2,700 agents and 3,500 other employees. HHS
says 1.6 million children would go unvaccinated. The SEC
warns employees they'd be furloughed two days a week.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ EMERGES as a political issue in several Senate and
House races.
   Republicans Senate challengers rush to make hay: Michigan
nominee Scheutte blasts Sen. Levin for opposing
rehabilitation of the battleship Wisconsin, now on guard in
the Gulf; Iowa's Tauke and Montana's Kolstad blast opponents
Harkin and Baucus as soft on defense before the crisis. But
the crisis may help Foreign Relations Committee Democrats
Pell and Simon.
   The issue also flares up in several House races. Virginia
Democratic candidate Moran cites a vote by GOP Rep. Parris
for subsidized food exports to Iraq only days before the
invasion; he threatens to punch Parris for saying that "the
only three people I know who support Saddam Hussein's
position are Moammar Gadhafi, Yasir Arafat and Jim Moran."
   In Maryland, where Democratic Rep. Dyson supports U.S.
action in the Gulf, his primary challenger hits him for his
C.O. status during Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   LEAD BALLOON: While a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll shows that three-quarters of American voters saw Saddam
Hussein's televised meetings with Western hostages, the
meetings hardly had the desired effect: By an overwhelming
86% to 6%, voters say the meetings harmed rather than helped
his image.
                                                                                                       

   EAST EUROPE'S FUTURE darkens because of cuts in Soviet oil
deliveries, price shocks from economic changes and drought.
While attention is on the Gulf crisis, a State Department
official worries these problems could "derail the reform
efforts or even pull the plug on governments."
                                                                                                       

   BROWN BLUNDERS in allowing the firing of lawyer Stanley
Brand as Democratic Party parliamentarian, party operatives
say. Brand was ostensibly sacked for representing Robert
Thompson, lobbyist for James Fail, whose acquisition of a
Texas thrift is under congressional investigation. But
Brown's own law firm represents Fail -- a fact the chairman's
critics are sure to use against him.
                                                                                                       

   NEXT IN LINE to be federal drug czar, if William Bennett
steps down within a year as rumored, may be Reggie Walton,
Bennett's deputy and a former judge known for tough criminal
sentencing. Walton would have obvious political appeal to the
White House: He is a black law-enforcement enthusiast who has
forged strong ties with state and local officials.
                                                                                                       

   THE SEC nears new enforcement power, but may be
ill-prepared to use it.
   The Senate and House are close to a compromise on
legislation giving the agency new disciplinary power for a
host of misdeeds. But many worry that the SEC has a woefully
thin staff of administrative judges, virtually guaranteeing
long waits for any commission action.
   Some defense lawyers complain that the process will become
stacked against defendants and that the SEC will stop
bringing cases in federal court, preferring to act
internally. "This is the most dramatic change in the federal
securities laws in at least 15 years," says lawyer and former
SEC official Harvey Pitt. "You've completely changed the
burden of proof."
   SEC Chairman Breeden argues that the agency's new
authority will allow it to find a middle ground "between a
slap on the wrist and the atomic bomb."
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Iran's Khomeini, though dead, remains the
Middle East leader most disliked by Americans, the
Journal/NBC poll shows; 37% dislike him the most. Gadhafi
finishes second at 28% and Saddam Hussein third with 15%. . .
. Nebraska Gov. Orr -- coincidentally facing a stiff
re-election race this November -- is featured in a two-page
spread in the new Lands' End catalog extolling the mail-order
company's briefcases. . . . Preparing for White House budget
talks, Sen. Sasser says, "I haven't had this much fun since I
was studying for the bar exam."
