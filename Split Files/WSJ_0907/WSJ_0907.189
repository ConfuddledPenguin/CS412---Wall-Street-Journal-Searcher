   NEW YORK -- Corporations that issued junk bonds have
defaulted on $9.4 billion principal amount of the securities
so far this year, up from $8.8 billion for all of last year.
   Those figures are among the findings in a Salomon Brothers
Inc. junk bond default study that was released yesterday.

   The study includes all non-convertible securities issued
in the past 13 years.
   Salomon said that this year's defaults bring the
cumulative principal amount of high-yield defaults and
troubled exchange offers since Jan. 1, 1977 to $27.8 billion.
   The investment firm estimated that through the end of June
1990, defaults have resulted in a $16.4 billion cumulative
loss in principal and interest payments to bondholders.
   The retail industry had the largest number of troubled
issues and accounted for 18.2% of all junk bond defaults
between January 1977 and Aug. 15, 1990. In addition, 35% of
all junk bonds issued by retailers have defaulted during the
13-year period studied.
   The oil and gas industry had the second-largest percentage
of defaults and represented 10.6% of total defaults since
1977, with most of the defaults occuring between 1984 and
1986.
   The study considers a bond in default if the issuer failed
to make a scheduled interest payment before the expiration of
a "grace period" or if the issuer filed for bankruptcy court
protection under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   The average weighted annual default rate as of Aug. 15 was
3.79% of the total value of outstanding junk bonds, which are
high-yield speculative grade corporate bonds that have low
credit ratings or no credit rating at all.
