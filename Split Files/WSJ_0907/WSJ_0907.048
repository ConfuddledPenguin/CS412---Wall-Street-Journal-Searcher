   NEW YORK -- Millicom Inc. said a joint venture, in which
one of its subsidiaries is a shareholder, was awarded a
license to provide cellular-telephone service in Bolivia.
   The license, awarded in a bidding process, is the first
that the Bolivian government has granted, Millicom said. The
system initially will serve the country's major metropolitan
areas. Officials declined to value the transaction.
