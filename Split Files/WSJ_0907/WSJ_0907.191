   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. introduced a
cleaner-burning high-octane gasoline that will replace its
current premium unleaded gasoline in Southern California.
   On a hot, smoggy day at a local gasoline station, Arco
Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook ceremoniously unveiled what the
company calls "EC-Premium," which the station was selling for
$1.359 a gallon.

   EC-Premium follows the introduction a year ago of EC-1, a
form of emission-control regular gasoline intended for
pre-1975 cars and pre-1980 trucks. As for unleaded regular,
which represents 60% of Arco's gasoline sales, Mr. Cook said
that it would take four to five years to bring out a
reformulated version, would cost the company about $2 billion
and "depends what the government mandates." Tough new
California regulations and federal legislation are pending.
   Mr. Cook said the new gasoline was costing the company
four cents a gallon more to produce, but he said wholesale
prices would not be increased "in the immediate future"
except to reflect increases in crude prices. He said Arco
hoped to make up the difference by increasing market share.
He said the cost of developing EC-Premium and bringing it to
market was "a few million" because it didn't require major
changes in the refining process.
   EC-Premium reduces benzene emissions by about 55%,
compared with its old unleaded premium, the company said, and
is also lower in aromatics, olefins and evaporative pressure.
Like EC-1, the new gasoline will be sold at stations from
Santa Barbara to the Mexican border, and east to the Arizona
state line. Sales of leaded regular gasoline have increased
3% since EC-1 was introduced, even though the customer base
of cars and trucks without catalytic converters has been
shrinking through attrition.
