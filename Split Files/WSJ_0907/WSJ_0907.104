   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Financially troubled Mack Trucks
Inc. said it approved an $81 million buy-out by Renault
Vehicules Industriels S.A.
   Mack said the agreement, which calls for the Paris-based
Renault to pay $6.25 a share, was reached earlier in the
week.

   Renault started the week with 44.5% of Mack's 29 million
shares. On Wednesday, the French firm purchased 4.5% more.
   The French firm hopes to buy the rest of the stock by
Sept. 20, said a Renault spokesman.
   Renault has been trying to buy out Allentown-based Mack
for several months, saying it was making the offer "because
of the continuing deterioration of the financial condition of
Mack" and the need to restructure the company's debt.
   Mack had a record loss of $185.4 million last year and a
loss of $97.2 million in the six months ending June 30. Net
sales for the first half of 1990 were $793.9 million, a 22%
decrease from $1 billion a year earlier.
   The company's five-year financial plan in July projected a
net loss of about $130 million for this year. At the time,
Mack officials said they did not expect the company to show a
profit before 1992.
   In the past year, Mack has tried to reduce business costs
and conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks.
   Mack's financial adviser, BT Securities Corp., called the
$6.25-a-share offer fair.
   A Mack spokesman said the merger would have no immediate
effect on the firm's employees. "This just reflects a
corporate change," he said.
   The Renault spokesman said it was too early to predict any
changes. "This is still in the preliminary stages," he said.
   Mack is one of North America's largest producers of
heavy-duty diesel trucks. Mack also markets a line of
medium-duty diesel trucks throughout North America and parts
of Central America, Australia and New Zealand.
