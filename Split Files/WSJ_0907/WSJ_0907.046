   NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled because of soaring oil
prices and the growing expectation among investors that
analysts are about to unleash a torrent of reduced
corporate-earnings estimates.
   The October futures contract for crude oil advanced $1.66
a barrel to close at $31.43. There were news reports of
violence against Americans in Kuwait, which could spark a
military confrontation. Oil's climb helped drive the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down 31.93 points in light trading
to 2596.29.

   Bonds rose slightly, with traders reluctant to change
positions ahead of today's report on how the nation's work
force fared last month. The consensus expectation is that the
unemployment rate will be unchanged from July's 5.5%.
   The dollar continued to slump against most other major
currencies. The yen continued to rise on speculation that
Japanese interest rates are likely to increase while those in
the U.S. decline.
   Although rising oil prices didn't help, it was reports of
analysts readying earnings-estimate cuts that sent shivers
through the stock market. For example, Smith Barney
downgraded its estimate for Motorola, and the stock plunged 7
5/8 to 61 1/2.
   A couple of technical indicators also may have triggered
some selling. The rise Wednesday in the Dow industrials to
2628.22 pushed the average close to a range in which
technicians expect resistance from buyers. That reading was
confirmed Wednesday for some analysts by a 10-day average of
a ratio of volume in advancing stocks to volume in declining
ones.
   "That said the market was no longer oversold, so that
changed the mind-set of the bargain hunters," said Ted
Eggert, manager of equity research at Yamaichi International.
"With the background of earnings-estimate cuts, this {market}
is not a fun place to be."
   Christopher Pedersen, trading director at Twenty-First
Securities, said the softness in the dollar also is
depressing stock prices. "Normally the dollar would rally in
a situation like this," he said, referring to the threat of
war in the Mideast. "The fact that that's not happening has
been a big surprise for a lot of people."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 125.6 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues led
advancers, 960 to 511.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000
of face amount, in light trading. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond eased to 8.95%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5550 marks and 140.70 yen, compared with
1.5585 marks and 141.70 yen Wednesday.
