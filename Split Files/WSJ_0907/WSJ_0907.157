   An affiliate of Imperial Oil Ltd., Toronto, said it plans
to build a 22 million Canadian dollar (US$19.1 million)
pipeline to transport natural gas liquids from the Caroline
field, 62%-owned by Shell Canada Ltd., a Calgary,
Alberta-based unit of the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell
Group.
   The Federated Pipe Lines Ltd. affiliate is jointly owned
by units of Imperial, which is 70%-owned by New York-based
Exxon Corp., and Calgary-based Interhome Energy Inc., which
is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family. Federated said
it received approval from Alberta energy regulators to build
the 32,000-barrel-a-day pipeline. Construction is to begin in
late 1991.

   The 95-mile pipeline will transport gas liquids from the
Caroline field, about 75 miles northwest of Calgary, to
Federated's pipeline system, and on to storage and processing
facilities near Edmonton, or enhanced oil recovery projects
northwest of the city. Shell Canada last week received
regulatory approval to begin developing its Caroline field at
a cost of about C$825 million. Output is expected by early
1993.
