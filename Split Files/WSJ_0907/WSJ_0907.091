   NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market sank further as
oil prices surged back above $30 a barrel.
   Traders say OTC share prices started out weak following
reports that an American hostage in Kuwait had been shot by
Iraqi forces and continued lower amid oil's implacable rise.

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October futures
contract for a barrel of light sweet crude oil gained $1.66
to close at $31.43.
   "Oil is dictating which way this market goes," says Lance
Zipper, manager of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index ended with a 3.66 point loss,
down 0.96% to 378.78. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index slipped more than 1%.
   The rise in oil prices has revived some of the OTC
market's energy stocks.
   U.S. Energy rose 1 1/8 to 10 3/8 and Hamilton Oil added 1
7/8 to 42 3/8.
   But rising stocks were hard to find yesterday. OTC
advancers trailed decliners, 719 to 1,060. Volume rose to
98.7 million shares from Wednesday's 89 million shares.
   Jim Bellini, director of equity trading at Dain Bosworth,
says that the selling pressure remains light, as most
investors are sitting tight with their current stock
positions.
   But some of the big securities firms are now unabashedly
calling this a bear market, and are cautioning clients that
stock prices may slide beyond their lows hit at the end of
August.
   Robert Salomon Jr., managing director at Salomon Brothers
Inc., says that stock prices are still too high given the
outlook for corporate profits.
   "We anticipate a decline of 7% in S&amp;P 500 earnings in
1991," Mr. Salomon says, with the worst of that decline
coming early in 1991 following the onset of a recession in
the fourth quarter of this year.
   While he believes profits should snap back later in 1991,
"the earnings rebound is too far away and too tenuous to
support stock prices today," he says.
   Mr. Salomon says he is looking for the S&amp;P 500 Index to
fall to around the 260 level, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average could drop as low as 2,100.
   The S&amp;P 500 Index fell 3.93 yesterday to 320.46, while the
the industrial average fell 31.93 to 2,596.29.
   While Salomon Brothers doesn't have a specific outlook for
the over-the-counter market, the firm is advising its clients
to stay in the more liquid stocks.
   JLG Industries managed to attract buyers following a
strong earnings statement. The stock rose 1 3/4 to 14 after
JLG reported fiscal fourth quarter profit of 77 cents a
share, up from 58 cents a share last year.
   Mack Trucks added 3/8 to 6 1/8 after France's Renault
raised its tender offer price for Mack Trucks' shares to
$6.25 each from its earlier offer of $6 a share.
