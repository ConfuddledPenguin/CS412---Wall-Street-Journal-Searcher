   Teen-Age Boys Are the Lost Market in Magazine Land

   Say you're a typical 14-year-old boy. You like sports,
video games, cars and junk food. But occasionally you wonder:
Did that girl really want me to kiss her or was she totally
grossed out? Am I the groovemeister I think I am or just a
garden-variety geek?
   When girls are confronted by such adolescent travails,
they turn to Seventeen, Sassy, YM or Teen, four magazines
dedicated to the teen-age girl. But teen-age boys have only
one magazine to call their own -- Boy's Life -- and that is
known for its coverage of hobbies like stamp-collecting
rather than the emotional peaks and valleys of the teen
years.

   At a time when publishers are deluging the market with
magazines for men, and when niches from bow-hunters to
back-pain sufferers have their own journals, teen-age boys
remain the forgotten people. They may read Sports Illustrated
for sports, Playboy for thrills, Rolling Stone for music or
comics for fun, but their own lives remain unexamined in the
pages of magazines. Advertisers and publishers say that's
because teen-age boys read less than girls, buy less and
wouldn't be caught dead contemplating such touchy-feely
things as how they look or feel.
   Recent research suggests that is changing. From a very
early age, boys care about how they look, new data suggest.
Beginning in their mid-teens, many boys start aching to be
popular. And by the age of 16, boys spend more on clothes
than any other item. Yet although a few more publishers are
beginning to dip their toes into the teen-age-boy pond, most
still believe it's quicksand.
   "If they're not Boy Scouts or sports fans or into hot-rod
cars, there's no core," says Robert Schmidt, chairman of the
Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver ad agency. "There's no one
subject that you can build a magazine around. You can reach
these guys elsewhere -- on radio, late night television and
Saturday afternoon sports events."
   Yet Jane Pratt, editor in chief of Sassy magazine,
believes boys are more interested in themselves than most
people think. "Teen-age boys are hipper than they used to
be," says Ms. Pratt. "And they spend more on beauty products,
which they call grooming. With so many broken homes and
families with both parents working, kids have to be adults a
lot faster."
   A year from now, Lang Communications' Sassy plans to
publish a boys' edition of the magazine that will go to Sassy
subscribers, with the idea that they will pass it along to a
brother or boyfriend, and that may be sold on newsstands.
Field &amp; Stream magazine, a unit of Times Mirror, plans to
introduce Field &amp; Stream Jr. as a special section in its
November issue, aimed at kids interested in traditional-boy
endeavors like hunting and fishing. But it won't cover how
boys look and feel, despite research indicating that boys
care about such things.
   Indeed, in a poll commissioned by Sports Illustrated for
Kids, a new publication aimed at 8-to-14-year-old boys and
girls, as many boys as girls admitted using hair mousse.
Also, many boys under 12 years old are regular users of
mouthwash and deodorant, and more than half use hairspray.
"These kids don't smell," says Susan Alexander, marketing
director of S.I. for Kids. "This is about adopting grown-up
roles much younger." In the poll, most young boys said they
thought kids have to dress well to be cool, and half the boys
thought having a cool haircut contributed to overall
coolness.
   Boys 13 to 15 years old spend most of their money on food,
but at 16, clothes take over as No. 1, according to Lester
Rand of the Rand Youth Poll. Girls 16 to 19 years old still
spend more money overall each week than boys ($63.50 vs.
$54.60), but, Mr. Rand says, "the boys are closing in."
   Yet the consensus among advertisers and publishers is that
a magazine for teenage boys would be an uphill battle. The
biggest advertising categories in men's magazines -- tobacco,
alcoholic beverages and automobiles -- would be unsuitable or
severely limited in a magazine for boys. Other male
categories -- music, electronics and video games, for example
-- aren't big enough to support a boys' magazine the way
fashion, cosmetics and fragrance are for girls.
   "I guarantee you there's an editorial mix that would
appeal to boys," says Bobbie Halfin, Sassy's publisher, who
before joining Sassy considered starting a magazine for teen
boys. "But where are you going to get the ad pages? The
advertising side for boys just isn't as rich as it is for
girls."
   In the case of Boy's Life, ads come from some mass
marketers, such as Coca-Cola and General Mills, and from
special-interest advertisers like Coleman camping products
and Wilson sporting goods. Chuck Carroll, Boy's Life's
advertising director, says Levi jeans recently began
advertising in the magazine. "The buying power of the market
is growing," says Mr. Carroll. "Parents feel guilty about
leaving John and Susie alone, so they're more liberal about
giving them an extra few bucks to spend." The magazine, which
is owned by the Boy Scouts of America, has a circulation of
1.3 million.
   Field &amp; Stream decided to introduce its magazine for boys
because "research shows a real need for a magazine that
addresses kids on their own level," says Jack Grant, Field &amp;
Stream Jr.'s publisher. As for including advice about the
opposite sex in his magazine, Mr. Grant doubts that boys
would want it. "It's a macho thing with boys," he says.
"They'd probably want to read it, but they wouldn't want the
next kid to know they were."
   Sassy's edition for boys will be prepared by an all-male
staff, and, says Ms. Halfin, no females -- including herself
-- will be allowed to tamper with the product. "We don't want
what girls think guys think," says Ms. Halfin. "We want what
guys think."
   Yet knowing what a teen thinks at any given time is like
knowing where a fly will next alight. "These kids will fool
you every time," says Ann Moore, publisher of S.I. for Kids.
"If you miss this market by an inch, you've lost it." Yet
kids also have ferocious preferences, intense brand loyalty
and little hesitation about rejecting their parents' choices.
"You might as well grind up a $50 bill," says Ms. Moore, "as
buy your kid a pair of shoes without their input."

   Kraft Magazine
                                                                                                       

   Kraft General Foods said Family Circle magazine will
produce a special magazine for it that will be the biggest
single-sponsor issue ever produced by a women's service
magazine.
   The magazine, a special "holiday guide," will feature 20
pages of "advertorial" material, including recipes that can
be made with Kraft products like Cheez Whiz and Stove Top
stuffing.
   As part of the promotion, Kraft, a unit of Philip Morris,
said it will give away $500 million in coupons, its largest
coupon program ever. The coupons will be distributed in
newspapers beginning in November. Consumers redeeming three
of the coupons will get a free copy of the magazine.

   DIET COKE: A new Diet Coke TV ad features special effects
that make it look as though a number of NFL players "melt"
into a football field on a hot day. Boomer Esiason, the
Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback, spots a cooler full of
chilled Diet Cokes and rescues the players by tossing them
each a soft drink. Lintas:New York created the ad, which will
begin airing Sunday.
                                                                                                       

   RADIO CITY: Radio City Music Hall Productions, New York,
awarded its ad account to Serino Coyne, New York. The account
was handled by Grey Entertainment &amp; Media, a unit of Grey
Advertising.
                                                                                                       

   TRAVEL ACCOUNT: SuperClubs Resorts, Kingston, Jamaica,
named Avrett, Free &amp; Ginsberg, New York, to handle its ad
account. Billings weren't disclosed.
