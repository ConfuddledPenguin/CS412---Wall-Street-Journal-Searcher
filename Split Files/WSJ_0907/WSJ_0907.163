   NEW YORK -- A federal judge extended a freeze on the
payment of claims by the Manville asbestos personal-injury
trust while it continues to negotiate its refinancing.
   Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court in Brooklyn had
ordered the trust to come up with new financing by yesterday.
But in his latest order, the judge said that negotiators had
requested additional time to work out details of the
proposal. The judge extended the freeze until Oct. 6, but the
new financing is expected to be announced before then.

   The trust was set up as part of Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy court reorganization plan in 1988 to pay the
thousands of asbestos personal-injury claims against the
company. Asbestos, once widely used in construction and
shipyards, causes cancer and respiratory ailments years after
exposure.
   Under the reorganization plan, Manville can't be sued by
asbestos victims; instead, all asbestos personal-injury
claims must be filed against the trust, which is funded by
the company.
   Although the trust has assets of $2.6 billion, it has run
out of cash to pay claims and has said it won't begin paying
claims filed after 1989 for at least 25 years. Judge
Weinstein has ordered the trust to restructure its financing
and payment plans to overcome that delay.
   The company and the trust declined to comment on their
refinancing negotiations. Currently, new funding from the
company isn't scheduled to begin until next fall. The freeze
on claim payments allows exceptions for hardship cases.
