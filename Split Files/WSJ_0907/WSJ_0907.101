   NEW YORK -- The world's industrial economies continue to
show signs of slow growth.
   The Conference Board said its International Economic
Scoreboard shows the composite indexes of leading indicators
for 11 of the world's major industrial economies growing at
an annual rate of 2%, the same figure reported three months
ago. Since this figure predates the crisis in the Middle
East, the report suggests even slower growth ahead.

   "The recent curtailment of oil supplies and rise in the
cost of oil will likely add a depressing influence to the
slow growth prospects already shown by the leading indexes
for most countries," the report said.
   The report looks at leading indicators because these
measures are generally thought to signal future economic
trends.
   Europe is showing the greatest signs of strength,
especially West Germany, where the leading index is growing
at an annual rate of 4%. France is not far behind, with the
leading index rising at 3%. Italy's rate is 1%. The U.K.
index has fallen 1%.
   Japan continues to lead the Pacific region, with its index
growing at 3%, followed by New Zealand at 1%. Indexes in
Korea and Taiwan both dropped by 1%, while Australia's fell
3%.
   In North America, Canada's leading index is now falling at
a rate of 3%, while in the U.S. the leading index is growing
at 1%.
   The indexes are compiled monthly by the Center for
International Business Cycle Research at the Columbia
University Business School. The Conference Board is an
independent business research group.
