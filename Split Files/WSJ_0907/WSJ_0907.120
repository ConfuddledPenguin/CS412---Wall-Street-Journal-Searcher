   NEW YORK -- Telemedia Inc., a Montreal-based media
company, has closed New England Monthly magazine, citing a
sluggish advertising market and an ailing regional economy.
   The folding of the critically praised magazine is a
setback to the ambitious U.S. expansion plans of Telemedia,
one of Canada's largest media companies. In the U.S.,
Telemedia also publishes Harrowsmith Country Life and a new
epicurean magazine, Eating Well, launched in July. In Canada,
Telemedia owns 15 consumer magazines, 27 radio stations and
20 weekly newspapers.

   The staff of the regional prize-winning monthly was told
the magazine would be closed yesterday. Its September issue,
now on newsstands, will be its last.
   Telemedia said the magazine was facing "mounting losses,"
and that advertising revenue for the magazine had fallen by
$1 million so far in 1990.
   "After a $5 million effort to make a profit, the most
prudent thing to do is to shut the magazine down rather than
continue to build up debt," John Van de Kamer, president and
chairman of Telemedia, said in a statement.
   Telemedia had attempted to sell the Haydenville,
Mass.-based publication, but couldn't find a buyer. The
magazine, started in 1984, had been nominated every year for
a National Magazine Award, and twice was winner in the
General Excellence category.
