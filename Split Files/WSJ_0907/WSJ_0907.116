   NEW YORK -- Price Waterhouse said it received government
approval to conduct its own accounting and auditing, tax and
management consulting practice in the Soviet Union.
   The professional-services concern said it is the first
such organization to be authorized to develop a wholly owned,
multidisciplinary practice in the Soviet Union without
entering into a joint venture.

   Price Waterhouse has had an office in Moscow since
September 1989. It is recruiting staff directly from Soviet
universities. It has been staffing its office in Moscow with
a Russian-speaking expatriate staff.
   In June, the Soviet government granted permission to
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., and Ernst &amp; Young to perform audits on
joint ventures of Soviet and Western companies. But those two
firms established their practices in the Soviet Union through
joint ventures with local entities.
