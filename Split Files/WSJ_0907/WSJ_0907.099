   A year after Paramount Communications Inc.'s failed bid
for Time Inc., the big question still looms: What is Martin
S. Davis going to do for an encore?
   Paramount has spent the last year in talks with a number
of possible acquisition or merger candidates. And Mr. Davis,
chairman and chief executive officer of Paramount, says
discussions with a number of prospects continue. "Maybe
someone's going to buy us," he suggests. But so far, no deal
has materialized, in part because prices of media and
entertainment properties remain unrealistically high, Mr.
Davis says.

   After spending the last several years whittling Paramount
from a lumbering conglomerate to a streamlined entertainment
and publishing company, "we are designed to merge or acquire,
we're not designed to stay as is," says the 63-year-old Mr.
Davis. Among the businesses he has looked at are recorded
music, cable television, theme parks, newspaper publishing
and programming. But finding the right match, he adds,
"requires patience and a long-term investment view."
   Mr. Davis, who spent nearly $40 million on a $200-a-share
bid for Time, can take some consolation from the fact that
Time's defensive merger with Warner Communications Inc.
saddled the combined company with heavy debt that Paramount
doesn't have to worry about. And Time Warner stock, at nearly
$125 a share at the time of the merger, has plunged as low as
$72.50 a share recently, closing yesterday at $79.875, down
$1.125.
   But Mr. Davis has his own stock price to worry about. Once
a Wall Street favorite, Paramount has been trading near its
52-week low recently, and some once-bullish analysts have
turned sour, concerned by mounting costs in its movie
business and industrywide problems in publishing. Yesterday,
Paramount stock closed at $34.875, down 62.5 cents, on news
that the company expected earnings for fiscal 1990 to be "on
target," but "at the lower range" of earlier estimates of
$2.10 to $2.60 a share.
   For the fiscal third quarter, net income and earnings from
continuing operations rose to $106.2 million, or 88 cents a
share, a 10.2% increase from net income in the third quarter
last year of $96.3 million, or 80 cents a share, and a nearly
sixfold increase over earnings from continuing operations of
$18.5 million, or 15 cents a share.
   In the fiscal 1989 period, net income included $77.8
million, or 65 cents a share, from discontinued operations,
primarily the $3.35 billion sale of The Associates financial
services unit last year to Ford Motor Co. Third quarter
revenue rose to $1.04 billion from $950.6 million.
   Results from continuing operations in the third quarter
included net interest income of $10.6 million, primarily from
the investment of proceeds from the sale of Associates. Net
income in the comparable fiscal 1989 period included $32.1
million of net interest expense and the $48.3 million charge
for the Time bid.
   A number of analysts still regard Paramount as one of the
strongest long-term players in the entertainment and media
business, where the stocks of virtually all the big players
have taken a beating recently. But many analysts expected
Paramount to move more aggressively to expand with cash from
the Associates sale.
   That war chest is down to about $1.6 billion now; the rest
has gone to pay taxes, reduce debt, repurchase stock,
contribute to a $200 million Madison Square Garden
renovation, and make small acquisitions. For example,
Paramount paid about $119 million for 83% of television
station concern TVX Broadcast Group and about $75 million for
Computer Curriculum Corp.
   But some analysts remain leery. "It concerns me that a lot
of the cash raised with sale of Associates went out the door
without pulling off the big acquisition that would really
strengthen the company," says Alan Kassan, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "They made some small and medium
strategic acquisitions but they haven't added any major new
profit centers. The third leg of the stool is not there yet."
   It isn't for lack of trying. Paramount looked at Six Flags
Amusement Co. before Time Warner acquired a stake in it, and
negotiated with Geffen Records Co. prior to its acquisition
by MCA Inc. In both cases, Paramount backed away.
   Similarly, record industry executives say Paramount was in
discussions with Bertelsmann AG regarding the purchase of a
50% interest in its recorded music group, which includes RCA
Records. Bertelsmann was said to be seeking close to $900
million for the interest. Bertelsmann executives have
declined to comment.
   Mr. Davis declines to discuss specific companies. But he
acknowledges, "we have looked at specific opportunities to
invest in the theme park and recorded music businesses, but
we ultimately concluded that the opportunities presented
could not achieve an acceptable return on our investment
given the acquisition prices and growth potential of the
companies." He says he remains interested in both businesses
and will continue to explore opportunities.
   Paramount has also had discussions with cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc., and has reportedly been looking at
Gannett Co. since the Gannett Foundation announced plans
recently to sell its 10% stake. Wall Street analysts
speculate that Paramount might one day merge Viacom Inc. or
MCA. Another candidate: Capital Cities/ABC Inc., should
federal rules restricting ownership of both a studio and a TV
network be lifted.
   Mr. Davis bristles at analyst's criticisms that he hasn't
moved quickly enough, snapping, "we're not going to march to
the interests of short-term traders." Moreover, he says,
"having cash is nothing to be ashamed of," and the company's
balance sheet "is the strongest of any media and
entertainment company around."
   Some analysts agree. In a recent purchase recommendation,
research firm MacDonald Grippo Reily Inc. said "there may be
no sizzle in this story at the moment, but (Paramount) has
very solid asset values, has management which historically
has been adept at refining the mix of businesses, and will
generate cash at an accelerating rate." While publishing
operating profit rose 11% to $103.9 million in the third
quarter, Paramount's entertainment unit reported a 4% decline
in operating profit, to $55.1 million. Television operations
are strong, and Paramount Pictures has the summer's biggest
hit, "Ghost." But three other releases this summer were
disappointments. Paramount said yesterday that "Days of
Thunder" and "The Two Jakes" didn't contribute to earnings.
"Another 48 Hours" did make money, though not anywhere near
as much as expected.
   "Paramount has been caught up more than some other studios
in the cost spiral," says Mr. Kassan of Morgan Stanley. Mr.
Davis acknowledges costs are a problem. "We can't place the
blame on agents and talent," he says. "Obviously they are
going to ask for as much as they can get. Unfortunately, this
is an industrywide problem based on frenzied competition,
which has bid up costs beyond realistic levels. Everyone is
guilty of it."
   But Mr. Davis vows that the inflation will halt. "We at
Paramount aren't going to continue on that route and we are
taking the steps we believe are necessary for containment,
while still producing commercially successful, quality motion
pictures," he says. Paramount Chairman Frank Mancuso has
recently made some management changes at the studio, and more
are expected.
   Despite the slings and arrows of analysts, some big
investors, at least, remain bullish. Investor Mario Gabelli,
a longtime investor, recently lifted his stake to 5.08%,
saying he likes the long-term prospects. And Mr. Davis says
enhancing values remains his priority -- even if it means
selling the company and stepping aside himself. "My interest
is solely in creating the best value for the shareholders, no
matter where it takes me," he says. "I've never deviated from
that position."
