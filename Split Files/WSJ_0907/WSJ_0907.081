   France's Societe Generale said it plans to acquire 40% of
Spanish brokerage Interdealers, the latest step in the
consolidation and internationalization of Spain's financial
market.
   Societe Generale said it plans to buy the Interdealers
stake in two stages for an undisclosed sum from its current
shareholders -- six former stockbrokers, including the former
chairman of the Madrid stock exchange, Javier Ramos.

   Immediately afterwards, both sides will subscribe to a
capital increase, raising the brokerage's capital and
reserves from one billion pesetas ($10.2 million) to 1.5
billion pesetas.
   Interdealers, set up in 1985, has 70 employees and a 1%-2%
share of the Spanish securities market. Like other Spanish
brokerages, it has suffered since the start of this year from
a market downturn.
   Earlier this year, it reported pretax profits for the
first half of 1990 of 17 million pesetas, compared with
pretax earnings of 290 million pesetas for all of 1989.
   In a joint statement, the two partners said the linkup
will strengthen Interdealers' activities in Spain and give it
access to Societe Generale's international financial network.
   Societe Generale is a leading player in international
futures and options markets, areas in which Spain is
expanding.
