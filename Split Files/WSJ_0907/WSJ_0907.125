   Barton Industries Inc. said it signed a contract with
Southern Co. giving Barton the right to build a fiber-optic
transmission cable along selected routes on the Southern
electric system.
   Barton, based in Shawnee, Okla., said the engineering and
installation will be performed by Atlanta-based Southern
electric system and that Barton, a maker of oil field
equipment, will reimburse Southern for the costs. Barton
wouldn't disclose the anticipated costs.

   Barton said some of the fibers will be used by Southern's
utilities network for internal communications, while the
remainder will be used by Barton primarily to transmit
information received from Barton's energy automation systems
to its customers' corporate offices.
