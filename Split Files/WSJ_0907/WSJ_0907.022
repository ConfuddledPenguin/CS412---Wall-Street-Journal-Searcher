   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The state-owned airline, Viacao Aerea
Sao Paulo, was sold for $43.7 million to a private consortium
of VASP employees and a wealthy businessman.
   The sale took place in an auction at the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange. The VOE/Canhedo consortium, which was the only
group bidding, purchased 60% of the company's shares. The
privatization of VASP had been in the works for more than two
years.

   The Sao Paulo state government retained 40% of the shares
but is expected to reduce this stake to 30% within three
months. Airline employees will be able to purchase 10% of the
shares owned by the government.
   VOE was recently formed by VASP employees to participate
in the bidding. It owns 20% of the consortium. The
consortium's majority partner, Wagner Canhedo, owns several
transportation, mining, agricultural and tourism companies.
The consortium will have to renegotiate VASP debt of $750
million.
   Mr. Canhedo said he hopes to increase VASP's national and
international flights.
   VASP has a fleet of 21 Boeing Co. 737-200 and eight Boeing
737-300 planes, and three aircraft made by Airbus Industrie,
a European consortium. The airline has routes to most major
Brazilian cities and to Aruba. It also operates charter
flights to Cuba and Argentina.
