   The recent slayings of five college students in
Gainesville, Fla., have focused new attention on a legal
effort to compel schools to disclose campus crime statistics.
   The U.S. Senate this month will consider a bill that would
require all post-secondary institutions that receive federal
aid to publish annual security reports that include the
number of violent crimes committed against students. The
report would be distributed to students and university
employees. Prospective applicants could receive the
information upon request.

   "People are looking at the Florida tragedy and realizing
this is a serious problem," says a Senate aide familiar with
the bill. "We tend to look at higher institutions as idyllic
places, but they can be dangerous environments. Too many
people go off to college not thinking about it."
   The drive to improve campus security is being spearheaded
by Constance B. and Howard K. Clery Jr., a Bryn Mawr, Pa.,
couple. In April 1986, their 19-year-old daughter Jeanne Ann
was murdered in her Lehigh University dormitory by another
student.
   Ms. Clery's killer had no difficulty entering her dorm
that morning. Three doors, with automatic locks, had been
propped open by students having a party. And Ms. Clery left
her room unlocked because her roommate forgot the key.
   In 1987, Josoph M. Henry was convicted of killing Ms.
Clery. But the Clerys say they were shocked to learn at the
trial about the level of crime at Lehigh and lapses in
security on the Bethlehem, Pa., campus.
   The Clerys filed a $25 million negligence suit against
Lehigh, which was settled for an undisclosed amount. They
used the money to set up Security On Campus Inc., a nonprofit
clearinghouse for information about campus crime. The
organization published a booklet listing questions parents
and prospective students should ask colleges about security.
The group also maintains a data base of appellate cases
involving lawsuits against universities.
   The Clerys have also lobbied state lawmakers to force
colleges to disclose information about campus crimes. Ten
states, including Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Delaware and
Louisiana, have enacted laws requiring universities and
colleges to publish three-year campus crime statistics.
Similar bills are pending in 30 other states.
   According to the Campus Violence Research Center at Towson
State University in Towson, Md., 639 sexual assaults, 2,598
physical assaults and six homicides occurred on 368 college
campuses in 1988, the latest year for which data are
available. The center says that 80% of all campus crime is
committed by students.
   But the group and other experts say the figures don't give
a complete picture of campus crime. Many schools report data
through local police agencies, but the campus statistics
aren't itemized in the final reports. And the experts contend
that universities frequently discourage students from
reporting crimes out of concern for bad publicity.
   While lawmakers say there has been no formal opposition to
the federal bill, concerns have been raised by educational
institutions that making crime information publicly available
may encourage suits. In recent years, courts in California,
New York, Florida and Massachusetts have held colleges and
universities liable for failing to protect students from
foreseeable criminal activity.
   Some lawyers feel that forcing universities to publish
crime statistics will make it easier to establish liability.
"In the past, when suing universities it has been difficult
to establish how many rapes and murders occurred on campus.
It will be far easier now to litigate the issue of
foreseeability," says Jeffrey A. Newman of the Boston firm
Newman, Durso &amp; Itzkowitz, which is handling 10 pending suits
against universities involving campus crime issues.
   In addition, there is some wariness about the possible
misuse of crime statistics. "We support the spirit of the
bill," says John Smeaton, assistant vice president for
student affairs at Lehigh. "But statistics alone do not tell
the whole story and are subject to misunderstanding."
   Some proponents of the federal bill have questioned
whether requiring colleges to report crime statistics will
help solve the problem. "The bill goes a long way to start
making people aware of crime on campuses. But it doesn't
speak in any way to the root causes of the crimes," says Jan
Mitchell Sherrill, director of the Campus Violence Prevention
Center. Mr. Sherrill said he would like to see colleges
implement crime prevention programs.
   Indeed, the recent Gainesville tragedy demonstrates the
limitations of the Florida law requiring statistics to be
reported. The state Legislature enacted a campus security
information bill in 1989. But under the law, the slayings
won't be included in crime statistic reports for the
University of Florida and Santa Fe Community College, where
the victims were students, because the killings occurred in
off-campus apartments. (The proposed federal law requires
educational institutions to report crimes committed against
students regardless of whether they occur on campus.)
   Nonetheless, the Clerys and others believe that publishing
the statistics will force universities to beef up campus
security. "It won't reduce the number of criminally inclined
individuals," says Frank Carrington, a Virginia Beach, Va.,
lawyer specializing in representing crime victims, including
the Clerys' organization. "But if students know they should
take care of themselves, if they are forewarned to walk in
pairs, then crime will decline."
   Lehigh's Mr. Smeaton says that since Ms. Clery's murder,
the school has increased its campus police force from 12 to
15 officers. Residence halls are locked 24 hours a day and
emergency telephones have been installed around campus, Mr.
Smeaton says.
   And as part of the settlement with the Clerys, alarms go
off in the campus police station if doors at Ms. Clery's
former dorm are left open for longer than 20 seconds. Mr.
Smeaton says the school plans to install similar systems in
all the dorms.
