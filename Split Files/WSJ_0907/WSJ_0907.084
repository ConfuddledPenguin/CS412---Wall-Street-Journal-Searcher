   National Intergroup Inc. said the Delaware Court of
Chancery approved its settlement of litigation related to the
company's tender offer for the outstanding cumulative
convertible preference units of Permian Partners L.P.
   The tender offer is conditioned upon the issuance of a
final court order approving terms of the previously announced
settlement.

   National Intergroup said it will mail unitholders a
supplement to the offer with the revised terms of the
contingent value rights, which are being offered pursuant to
terms of the settlement. After the supplement is mailed,
Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup plans to further extend
the tender offer by a minimum of 10 days.
   The drug wholesaler has offered to pay $3.85 for each
preference unit of Permian Partners, a limited partnership
involved in oil and gas gathering and marketing.
