   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged two penny-stock brokerage firms -- one in Las Vegas
and one in Colorado -- and 18 individuals with running
schemes that allegedly netted illegal gains of more than $20
million.
   The case is one of the biggest ever against a penny-stock
firm and roughly equals the size of the case against Blinder,
Robinson &amp; Co., the Denver penny-stock brokerage giant that
the SEC has been battling for years.

   So far, all of the defendants appear to be fighting the
SEC charges, which also include allegations of insider
trading. The agency's civil suit, filed in federal district
court in Denver, seeks repayment of all profits plus $3
million of civil penalties for the insider-trading charges.
   The agency said the firms, Power Securities Corp., Las
Vegas, and Allied Capital Group Inc., Englewood, Colo., along
with executives and promoters of the firms, misled investors
into buying penny stocks through fraudulent sales pitches and
used "high pressured, coercive sales practices." The firms,
which the SEC said had a "secret working relationship,"
netted $9.4 million through excessive markups in six
securities, according to the commission.
   The SEC also said the firms manipulated the market for the
securities of Star Publications Inc. and Art Cards Inc., two
other companies with penny stocks. Power and Allied
"secretly" limited the supply of securities, artificially
controlling the supply, demand and price of Star Publications
stock, the agency said. In the case of Art Cards, the
brokerage houses disseminated false information to
prospective investors, the SEC said. These two "schemes"
resulted in illegal profits of more than $10 million, the SEC
said.
   Some of the claims made by the brokerage firms were
blatantly false, the SEC said. For example, Power gave
brokers scripts to read to clients that touted pop artist
Peter Max and Yoko Ono, wife of the late Beatle John Lennon,
as spokesmen for Art Cards. Power salesmen claimed that the
two had appeared on Music Television, the Larry King "Live"
Show on Cable News Network and elsewhere to promote Art
Cards, the SEC said. But neither Mr. Max nor Ms. Ono worked
for the company, the agency said.
   The SEC also said that Power scripts stated that Star had
55 million shares outstanding and only 20 million trading;
but the company actually had 170 million to 500 million
shares outstanding at the time the statements were made, the
commission contended. In addition, Power brokers stated that
Star's razor product was biodegradable when in fact the razor
was made of plastic that wouldn't decompose and wasn't
biodegradable, the SEC said.
   The agency also charged the two brokerage houses with
insider trading in Star securities before the company was
acquired by closely held Inner Vision Inc. The SEC is seeking
repayment of $1 million in allegedly illegal profits, plus $3
million in insider-trading fines.
   In addition to the firms, the SEC charged Power's chief
executive officer, Richard T. Marchese; Power's former
president Orville L. Sandberg; Allied President Peter
Mercaldi; Allied's former president, Barry H. Freedman; and
several other executives of the two firms.
   A person at Allied Capital said that Mr. Mercaldi and
other officials qualified to comment were out of town. Power
Securities and the other officials named in the suit couldn't
be reached for comment.
