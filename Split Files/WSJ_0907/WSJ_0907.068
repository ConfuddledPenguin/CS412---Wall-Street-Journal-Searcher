   THE TOKYO CONNECTION

   South American drug rings for the first time have been
caught using a Tokyo connection to launder their cash,
Japanese and U.S. officials said.
   Police have concluded that a Colombian drug syndicate
transferred about $1.8 million through a Japanese bank branch
in Hong Kong and a Swiss bank branch in Tokyo. Japanese
newspapers quoted police as saying the money, which ended up
in a Colombian account at a U.S. bank, was intended for use
by a drug syndicate controlled by a reputed member of the
Medellin drug cartel.
   Authorities disclosed the transaction on the arrival in
Tokyo of U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who is in
Asia to discuss law-enforcement issues with other attorneys
general in the region.
   Mr. Thornburgh said the case "made the point very
graphically" that "any modern, efficient banking institution
is fair game for the process of laundering these billions of
dollars of drug proceeds."
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINE SALE IS SUSPENDED
                                                                                                       

   An Argentine judge ordered the suspension of the sale of
the state-owned airline Aerolineas Argentinas to a consortium
led by Spain's Iberia because the proposed buyers made the
down payment by letter of credit instead of cash.
Administrative Law Judge Oscar Garzon Funes gave the Public
Works Ministry eight days to explain why it accepted the
letter of credit; he said he would then decide whether to
annul the sale. The consortium agreed last July to buy 85% of
Aerolineas for $260 million and the retirement of $2 billion
of Argentina's foreign debt.
                                                                                                       

   A POSTPONEMENT IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China has pushed back the opening of its first futures
market to Oct. 12, representing the latest of a long series
of delays. William Grossman, managing director of the Chicago
Board of Trade's Asia-Pacific office, said in Tokyo that
Beijing decided to postpone the September opening of the
wheat-futures market in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan
Province, because of conflicts arising from the Asian Games,
which begin in China later this month. China, is using the
CBOT as a technical adviser.
                                                                                                       

   GERMAN-SOVIET TRADE
                                                                                                       

   West Germany will reportedly guarantee delivery agreements
of East German companies to the Soviet Union. The Berliner
Morgenpost, a West German newspaper, said that an agreement
being worked on would require both sides to dismantle or
remove "trade barriers of every type" in a step-by-step
fashion. The report said Bonn would even guarantee support
for East German companies that are in precarious financial
condition if they supply important goods to the Soviet Union.
                                                                                                       

   TAIWAN'S GOLD IMPORTS
                                                                                                       

   Concern over the Persian Gulf situation and worries over
rising inflation sent Taiwan's imports of gold and coins
soaring in August, bullion dealers said. Finance Ministry
statistics showed that gold imports totaled 13.24 tons valued
at $163.6 million in August, tripling the 4.27 tons valued at
$51.4 million imported in July. Switzerland was Taiwan's
biggest gold-bar supplier, shipping 8.13 tons of gold to
Taiwan in August.
                                                                                                       

   A DOG REGISTER FOR THE EC?
                                                                                                       

   The European Parliament's environment committee wants a
register set up for the European Community's millions of
dogs. Registering pets could help identify strays and control
the spread of rabies when border checks are abolished,
parliament member Anita Pollack argued. Before entering the
EC, foreign dogs would have to undergo blood tests to certify
they are rabies-free. The register wouldn't replace the
six-month quarantine in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
                                                                                                       

   CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM
                                                                                                       

   Roman Catholic leaders condemned anti-Semitism and racism
as they closed a Catholic-Jewish conference in Prague that
looked at growing anti-Semitic incidents in Eastern Europe.
   A statement issued during the four-day meeting said
delegates from 16 nations gave special attention to "recent
manifestations of anti-Semitism" in former Eastern bloc
nations since the fall of tightly run communist societies.
   The statement came at the end of the first formal meeting
in five years of the Pontifical Commission on Religious
Relations with the Jews and the International Jewish
Committee on Interreligious Consultations. The conference's
plan to fight anti-Semitism includes deleting racially or
religiously divisive material from textbooks and
establishment of courses for priests to counter anti-Jewish
sentiment.
   The plan also called for swift translation and
dissemination of recent Vatican statements on Catholic-Jewish
relations.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Libya has reported its first case of AIDS as the number of
cases world-wide rose by nearly 10,000 in August, according
to the World Health Organization. WHO said in its latest
monthly report there was a total of 283,010 officially
notified AIDS cases in 157 countries in August, up from
273,425 in July. . . . French farmers hijacked a truck
carrying British sheep yesterday near Nyons in southeastern
France and released the animals onto the streets. The
farmers, convinced that imports of low-cost meat are driving
down French prices, have hijacked at least 19 trucks carrying
imported livestock and meat since June.
