   ROSEMEAD, Calif. -- SCEcorp. said it won summary judgments
in an antitrust lawsuit filed against the company in 1983 by
the city of Vernon. U.S. District Court Judge Mariana
Pfaelzer dismissed the complaint, which alleged that the
utility had failed to give the city greater access to its
transmission lines and prevented the city from buying bulk
power supplies from other sources. The suit also accused the
company of failing to offer the city special rates.
