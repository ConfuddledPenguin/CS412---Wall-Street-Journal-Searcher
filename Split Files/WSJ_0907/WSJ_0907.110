   WASHINGTON -- A dissident group led by David C. Walentas
said it has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
investigate information it says casts doubt on the legitimacy
of a proposal for a business combination between Builders
Transport Inc. and Comcar Industries Inc.
   In a letter to the SEC, Mr. Walentas said a trucking
industry executive told him that he learned from a Comcar
executive that the February letter of intent between the two
companies was signed by Comcar as a favor to Charles C. Gay
Sr., chairman of Builders Transport at the time.

   Mr. Walentas said in an interview that Builders Transport,
a truckload carrier based in Camden, S.C., was "trying to
repel" his group's December proposal to acquire the company
at $13 a share, or $54.6 million, which he said the company
"rejected out of hand without speaking to us."
   Following the announcement of the Comcar proposal,
Builders Transport's common stock rose from $9.75 a share to
$13.25 a share. Builders Transport said in June that Comcar
wasn't willing to proceed with the transaction.
   Robert Garner, general counsel of Builders Transport,
denied Mr. Walentas's allegations. "We never would have
entered into an agreement with Comcar if we had any reason to
doubt the legitimacy . . . of (Comcar's) offer," Mr. Garner
said.
   Mr. Garner said Builders Transport is continuing
discussions with another suitor, Trism Inc., which it said is
pursuing financing for an offer.
