   Apple Computer Inc.'s USA division said it slashed prices
as much as 20% effective yesterday on its popular Macintosh
IIci personal computer.
   The price reduction is tied to the Cupertino, Calif.,
company's Oct. 15 introduction of three new lower-priced
personal computer models, said analyst Bruce M. Lupatkin of
Hambrecht and Quist in San Francisco.

   "It's basically product positioning," Lupatkin said.
   Apple officials denied this was the case, saying they were
simply following up on a successful marketing program two
months ago under which dealers were given flexibility in
offering discounts on the product.
   "Since then we've seen sales of the IIci take off," said
Bob Puette, president of Apple USA.
   The prices were slashed $1,500 on Apple's four system
configurations for the Macintosh IIci. The highest-priced
model with a 4MB RAM/SuperDrive floppy, for instance, was cut
to $5,969 from $7,469. The Macintosh IIci was introduced in
September 1989 and is considered in the middle of the
company's Macintosh line.
   Apple Computer shares closed at $35.75, down 25 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
