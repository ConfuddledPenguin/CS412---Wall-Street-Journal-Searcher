   WASHINGTON -- The war of words between the U.S. and Iraq
escalated, as the administration condemned the shooting of an
American civilian by Iraqi soldiers and President Bush
accepted an offer to appear on Iraqi television.
   Meanwhile, more Americans left Iraq and Iraqi-controlled
Kuwait. A small group of Americans left on a
Canadian-chartered airplane for Turkey, and an
Iraqi-chartered flight for U.S. citizens is scheduled to
depart today, according to the State Department.

   A State Department official said Iraqi authorities have
given the U.S. "reason to believe this will not be the only
flight allowed." He said the flights probably would be
limited to women and children.
   Mark Dillen, a State Department spokesman said, "We plan
to continue this procedure as long as we have U.S. citizens
who want to leave Iraq and Kuwait." He said more than 150
U.S. citizens have departed Iraq by chartered flights.
   At the same time, U.S. efforts to get European allies to
pay the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis made some headway,
but not as much as U.S. officials would like. Foreign
ministers of the 12 European Community nations, meeting
tomorrow in Rome, are expected to approve tentatively aid to
Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, the nations hit hardest by the
embargo on trade with Iraq. But it's far less certain that
the Europeans will contribute cash to defray the costs of the
U.S. deployment of troops and planes to Saudi Arabia.
   For the first time in the confrontation with Iraq, the
administration is having to formulate a response to Iraqi
violence against an American. The State Department confirmed
initial reports that the man, who wasn't identified, was shot
in the forearm as he climbed from the window of his apartment
in Kuwait City in an effort to evade Iraqi soldiers.
   Mr. Dillen, called the shooting "outrageous behavior." He
reiterated that the administration will "hold the Iraqi
government responsible for the health and welfare of all
American citizens held against their will in Kuwait and
Iraq." He declined to "speculate about any future response"
from the U.S. to the incident.
   The State Department summoned Iraq's ambassador to the
U.S. to protest the shooting. The U.S. also demanded the
return of the body of a U.S. citizen who died of a heart
attack last month. The man had been held by Iraq as a
"shield" at one of its military facilities. U.S. officials
also urged Iraq to permit the man who was wounded to depart.
   The U.S. learned of the shooting, Mr. Dillen said, from a
U.S. friend of the wounded man. He said Iraqi officials told
the U.S. that "the injury is not serious" and that the man
would be released from the hospital within 24 hours.
   The Iraqi officials said the man will remain in custody
after being transferred to Baghdad. Mr. Dillen said that the
U.S. expects American diplomats will be able to see the man
at that time.
   The U.S. is concerned about reports that Iraqi soldiers
are using live ammunition in their efforts to round up
foreigners, tactics that could spark more violence. Mr.
Dillen called the reports "extremely disturbing, and yet
another indication of the lengths to which the Iraqis are
willing to go to carry out their inhumane policy of using
innocent foreigners as shields while denying them the right
to leave."
   In the battle of the airwaves, the U.S. moved to try to
gain advantage over Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Iraqi
officials, apparently in response to assertions they aren't
letting the Iraqi people know about the international
response to the invasion of Kuwait, offered to send an Iraqi
television crew to Washington to interview Mr. Bush and to
run the interview on national television.
   The White House has been peeved at the extensive air time
U.S. televison networks have given to Saddam Hussein and
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. President Bush rejected
the interview offer but said he would send a taped message to
Iraq.
   "Although we have not heard from Iraq directly, we accept
their offer of a broadcast to the Iraqi people," said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. "The president
will tape a message to the Iraqi people in the next few days,
which will be provided to the Iraqi information minister."
   Mr. Fitzwater, who said the message will run 10 to 15
minutes, declared: "We assume the offer means they will
broadcast the message in its entirety." To bar any tampering
with it, the White House plans to make it available here.
It's unclear whether Iraq will run the tape.
   In the propaganda war, Saddam Hussein has portrayed
himself as a reasonable leader under seige by the U.S. The
U.S. administration has portrayed the situation as a
confrontation between Iraqi aggressors and the international
community.
   The U.S. is stitching together an international campaign,
but it's not clear if it will be broad enough to satisfy U.S.
lawmakers who want other nations to bear more of the load.
European nations are trying to decide on the final amount of
aid each will offer to nations hurt by the embargo against
Iraqi trade. The U.S. has suggested that EC nations
contribute a total of as much as $2.5 billion in immediate,
short-term support to be divided among Jordan, Turkey and
Egypt. The U.S. estimates those nations will need a total of
$10.5 billion in aid this year and next.
   European officials aren't sure they should make cash
contributions to the U.S. military effort, as U.S. officials
want. The Europeans point to the growing fleet of European
naval vessels in the Persian Gulf to help enforce the embargo
against Iraq, as well as some French ground troops in the
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as a substantial
contribution.
