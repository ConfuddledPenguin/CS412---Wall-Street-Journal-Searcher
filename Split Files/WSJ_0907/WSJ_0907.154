   Telefonica de Espana S.A. said it is close to an agreement
to acquire a stake in American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
main European unit, as part of an effort to increase the
Spanish telephone company's access to new technology.
   A Telefonica spokesman said the company is seeking to swap
its 20% holding in AT&amp;T Microelectronica Espana S.A. for a
share in the Dutch-based AT&amp;T Network Systems International
B.V.

   State-controlled Telefonica hopes to acquire about 6% of
AT&amp;T Network Systems and to win a seat on both the Dutch
company's board and its management committee, the spokesman
said. Negotiators are assessing the value of the share swap,
a task hindered by exchange rate fluctuations in recent
months, he said.
