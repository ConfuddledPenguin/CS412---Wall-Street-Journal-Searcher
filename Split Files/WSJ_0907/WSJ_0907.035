   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., its margins squeezed by weak
tire prices and rising raw-material costs, said it expects to
post a third-quarter net loss of about $65 million after $51
million in charges.
   The expected third-quarter loss would be the largest
quarterly deficit in Goodyear's history, a company spokesman
said.

   In the 1989 third quarter, the Akron, Ohio, tire maker
reported net income of $70.5 million, or $1.22 a share, on
sales of $2.68 billion.
   Goodyear, which also forecast that fourth-quarter earnings
will be flat, signaled that its situation might worsen. The
company said a general economic downturn is likely later this
year, continuing into 1991, with the Mideast crisis possibly
resulting in increased raw-material costs and other adverse
market conditions. Tire makers rely heavily on
petroleum-related products: A single tire requires as much as
eight gallons of crude oil or equivalents.
   Goodyear's predicament reflects a general decline
throughout the world tire business. For instance, Continental
AG of West Germany recently forecast that most tire makers
will have a "considerable drop" in 1990 earnings. Continental
noted that tire prices have dropped so precipitously in the
last 12 months that "the market situation has turned into a
regular price war."
   Continental, the No. 4 tire maker world-wide and parent of
General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in Akron, said it wasn't certain
how long it will take for the current earnings slump to
bottom out.
   While Japanese tire makers don't appear to be suffering as
much as their counterparts in other nations, Bridgestone
Corp. of Japan is saddled with debt from its purchase of
Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. of Akron. Bridgestone also has
been raising a fuss over the amount of capital investment
that has been required to bring its Firestone plants into
shape.
   But unlike Goodyear, Continental and Bridgestone expect to
finish the year in the black. Analysts said Goodyear's
performance was far worse than expected. "It's a staggering
kind of loss, even excluding unusual items," said Donald F.
DeScenza, an independent analyst based in Springdale, Conn.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Goodyear stock fell 87.5 cents a share to close at $22.25 a
share.
   The bulk of the charges that Goodyear took in the third
quarter are related to the planned layoffs by mid-1992 of
1,180 employees involved in European tire marketing and
distribution. Earlier this year, the company laid off 1,100
tire sales and marketing employees in the U.S.
   Goodyear said the restructuring also includes phasing out,
at its Valleyfield, Quebec, plant, tire production for
mediumsized and heavy trucks. The company said there would be
further layoffs of employees overseas, but it wasn't more
specific. Earlier this year the company laid off 530
employees at Valleyfield and 270 employees at the company's
Union City, Tenn., tire plant.
   The company also said some of the charges were for
environmental cleanup costs associated with operations that
were discontinued in 1986.
   Hoping to ease the strain on its profit margins, Goodyear
plans a 2% to 6% increase in prices for replacement tires,
effective Oct. 1. That comes on the heels of a similar
increase last month. Other tire makers also have announced
price rises, but so far it's unclear whether the increases
will come into effect.
   "If the prices don't firm, you're looking at a loss for
the fourth quarter" at Goodyear, said Harry W. Millis, an
analyst at McDonald &amp; Co., Cleveland. He had earlier expected
Goodyear to earn about 25 cents a share in the third quarter,
excluding unusual items.
   Goodyear is the only one of the major U.S. tire companies
that wasn't acquired during massive industry consolidation in
recent years. In 1986 it thwarted a takeover attempt by Sir
James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. Even now, with
its depressed stock price, it doesn't appear to be a likely
takeover candidate because it operates a money-losing crude
oil pipeline that it can't sell. Goodyear stock currently is
trading at less than half of its 1990 peak of $46 a share in
January.
