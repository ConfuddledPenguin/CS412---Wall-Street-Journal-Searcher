   A Japanese real estate tycoon's purchase of Pebble Beach
Co. and its resort golf courses doesn't necessarily signal a
new wave of "trophy" real estate purchases by foreign
investors, observers say.
   Minoru Isutani, a Japanese investor and golf course
developer, bought the Pebble Beach, Calif., company from
Miller-Klutznick-Davis &amp; Gray Co., a Denver real estate
partnership anchored by investor Marvin Davis. Terms of the
sale weren't disclosed, but persons familiar with the deal
put the price at more than $800 million and possibly as high
as $1 billion.

   Though it was known in recent weeks that Pebble Beach
assets were for sale, most real estate observers thought that
only a 49% minority interest was available instead of the
entire site.
   Real estate experts say the sale is a notable exception to
recent foreign investing trends in the midst of an unsettled
real estate market and negative publicity prompted by an $828
million Japanese investment in Rockefeller Group Inc. last
year. The Pebble Beach purchase is among the largest foreign
purchases of recreational properties in the U.S.
   "This {deal} is the all-time home run for a real estate
developer," says Kenneth R. Leventhal, chairman of the Los
Angeles accounting firm that bears his name. Even so, he
says, he expects the current trend of Asian investors turning
away from high-profile purchases and toward development
properties to continue. The purchase does illustrate a
growing interest in Western golf properties, Mr. Leventhal
adds.
   Other real estate experts agree. "When you're in a country
where land is at a terrible premium, you have a better
appreciation of it than Americans do," says Sanford R.
Goodkin, executive director of Peat Marwick's Goodkin Real
Estate Consulting in San Diego.
   Technically, Pebble Beach's new owner is Ben Hogan
Properties, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cosmo World USA, in
turn a unit of Mr. Isutani's Cosmo World Corp., based in
Tokyo.
   Thomas A. Oliver, president of the Pebble Beach Co., said
several bidders had been interested in the property, and
negotiations for Cosmo World had gone on for several months.
Mr. Oliver declined to discuss financial details of the
transaction. Calls to Cosmo World's office in Los Angeles
weren't returned, but officials said in a statement that no
changes in management at the property were expected.
   Mr. Isutani, who owns several golf courses in Japan, is
developing golf courses and resorts in Los Angeles; Las
Vegas, Nev.; Hawaii; Tucson, Ariz.; San Francisco; and
Europe. The Tokyo investor has been the subject of recent
Japanese press reports looking at his relationship with
Hisashi Shinto, the former head of NTT Corp. who faces
charges of political bribery.
   The 5,300 acre Pebble Beach site includes the famous
Pebble Beach Golf Links; the Lodge at Pebble Beach; the Inn
and Links at Spanish Bay; Spyglass Hill and Del Monte golf
courses; the 17-mile Drive, a scenic coastal route; and
undeveloped real estate on the Monterey Peninsula, about 110
miles south of San Francisco.
   Included in the sale is the Lone Cypress, a majestic tree
that juts out of a rocky point on the coastal property. The
tree recently caused a widely publicized flap between
professional photographers and the Pebble Beach Co., which
tried to bar unauthorized photos of the tree on the grounds
that it was a trademark item.
