   DALLAS -- The battle for Greyhound Lines has heated up as
management readies videotapes, "white papers" and other
evidence in an attempt to prove that a striking union seeking
a buy-out has conducted a reign of terror.
   It's all part of management's dogged attempt to win the
hearts and minds of creditors, who ultimately will decide the
fate of Greyhound, currently in the preliminary stages of a
bankruptcy-court filing.

   And with the threat looming of a buy-out bid organized by
the striking Amalgamated Transit Union, there is a sense of
urgency to the company's campaign.
   Few took the ATU's buy-out proposal seriously until the
union hooked up with Blackstone Group, a New York investment
banking firm, on a possible buyout bid. Blackstone, with its
$800 million buy-out and investment fund, would add muscle to
the ATU's efforts to wrest control of the company from
Chairman Fred Currey, who led a 1987 leveraged buy-out of the
bus line, a unit of GLI Holding Inc.
   With that in mind, Greyhound is anxious to blunt union
efforts to woo creditors; the company wants to maintain the
exclusive right to present a reorganization plan to them.
Greyhound's exclusivity rights expire Oct. 2, but the company
isn't expected to file its reorganization plan until early
November. Thus, Greyhound will need creditor support to seek
an extension. If creditors refuse, the union -- Blackstone
group could have an opening to file a competing plan.
   "They want to keep control of the case," Leigh Walzer, an
analyst with R.D. Smith &amp; Co., said of Greyhound. "They are
very concerned."
   Those worries have spawned a concerted effort to portray
the union as a volatile and unreliable business partner. ATU
President James La Sala may have unwittingly helped that
strategy along with a recent letter to union members stating
that "we intend to continue this fight for as long as it may
take until it is won or the company is destroyed."
   "They have orchestrated and condoned and led violence to
try to enforce economic demands that their employer couldn't
meet," Greyhound's Mr. Currey said in an interview. "I think
the proposition that investors -- Blackstone or otherwise --
would seek to have partnership with them isn't very
probable."
   Union officials, who have condemned the violence and
denied responsibility for it, say they remain confident and
note that Blackstone Group executives will meet with the
presidents of ATU locals on Sunday to discuss details of a
possible joint buy-out bid. But even if a proposal is made,
ATU leaders will face the task of undoing the dark image an
aggressive Greyhound has been painting of them.
   A videotape scheduled for showing to creditors, potential
lenders and the news media details violence during the strike
that began March 2 and includes evidence gathered for a suit
Greyhound filed last April against the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU's bargaining unit.
   Filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, the suit seeks $30 million in damages and
accuses the council and various union officials of trying to
extort wages and benefits from Greyhound through violence and
other disruptive acts.
   Employing footage shot by television news crews and
Greyhound security personnel, the videotape contains
sometimes grisly scenes of shootings and assaults, including
one clip of an elderly woman passenger being knocked to the
ground and bloodied by a man identified as a striker.
   Also included are portions of a subpoenaed audio recording
of an early 1990 union meeting in Dallas attended by Edward
Strait, president of the Amalgamated Council. On it, a voice
identified as Mr. Strait's is heard to comment that three
buses that caught fire on a Greyhound lot in Camden, N.J.,
last January, two months before the strike, "got so hot, they
burned up, sitting right in the middle of the lot."
   In an interview, Mr. Strait recalled making such comments
but said he didn't intend to incite violence or indicate that
he knew the source of those fires. "We're not the gangsters
and thugs that Fred Currey says we are," Mr. Strait said.
   Greyhound property and personnel have been the targets of
widespread assaults, shootings and vandalism throughout the
strike. ATU members charged in connection with those
incidents include Fred Ingram, an Amalgamated Council vice
president, who faces assault and battery charges in a
Fayetteville, N.C., county district court trial next month in
connection with an incident there last March.
