   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
in an extraordinary attempt to reverse its rejection last
month as the site for a new national magnet research center,
charged that National Science Foundation officials unfairly
undercut its bid for the center.
   MIT officials formally requested the National Science
Board, the NSF's governing body, to reconsider its decision
to award as much as $60 million in federal funding to
establish the magnet center at Florida State University. In
making the request, the MIT officials attacked
recommendations to the board in favor of Florida State from
former NSF director Erich Bloch, who recently stepped down
from his post, and from NSF assistant director David Sanchez.

   If the NSF officials "had presented a fair and adequate
comparison of the two proposals (from MIT and Florida State),
we would not contest the National Science Board decision,"
MIT President Paul E. Gray wrote in a letter to the board.
"Regrettably, this was not the case."
   Before the NSF board's vote last month, NSF-appointed
"peer review" committees of outside scientists had
recommended MIT as the site for the center. MIT now operates
a national laboratory considered the world leader in research
on strong magnets, which are used for studies on
superconductors, magnetically-levitated trains,
medical-imaging devices and other technologies.
   The NSF reviewers had said they favored MIT largely
because its new magnet center would be fully operational at
least two years sooner than the five or more years it would
take to build the center at Florida State.
   However, the NSF reviewers also had praised Florida
State's proposal, noting that officials there seemed more
enthusiastic about the new center than did administrators at
MIT. In recommending Florida State, Mr. Bloch added that at
proposed federal funding levels for the center, "MIT would
perhaps not be able to, or even committed to, create a
first-rate laboratory." In contrast, he noted, the Florida
State proposal included a commitment of $58 million of funds
from the state of Florida to help build the center.
   In their statements yesterday, MIT officials charged that
NSF staff members had underestimated both their enthusiasm
for the new center and the amount of non-federal funding they
would commit to build it. Among other things, they asserted
that Mr. Bloch "was totally and unfairly silent" in his
recommendation about the number of faculty and staff MIT
would commit to the new center.
   Messrs. Bloch and Sanchez couldn't be reached for comment.
A spokesman for the NSF said its board will "look at and
digest" MIT's request for reconsideration of the magnet
center decision but hasn't yet made a decision regarding it.
   Patrick Riordan, a spokesman for the Florida Board of
Regents, which oversees the state's university system, said,
"We're surprised and disappointed" by MIT's request. "Any
aspersions that might be cast on the caliber of our science
just won't wash."
