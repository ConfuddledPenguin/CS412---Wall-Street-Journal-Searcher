   WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican congressional
leaders vowed to present separate $50 billion
deficit-reduction packages as their opening bids in renewed
budget talks today.
   The quickened pace of discussions yesterday was the first
sign in months that the negotiators were serious about
devising a significant budget plan. Another indication will
come today, when President Bush opens the latest round of
talks at Andrews Air Force Base near here.

   In separate press conferences yesterday, the negotiators
of both parties said they would act in good faith to reach
agreement. Both also reiterated their support for the
previously agreed to goal of cutting the deficit by $50
billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and $500 billion
over five years, even though the economy has weakened further
and the Persian Gulf crisis has spurred energy prices since
they last met a month ago.
   Despite the promises of $50 billion packages, however,
both sides indicated that any final plan probably would fall
short of that. "It's a negotiating position and we're not
going to die for any part of it," Rep. Bill Frenzel (R.,
Minn.) said of the GOP plan. "We'll see where we go from
there."
   Both sides labored throughout the day to complete their
plans, amid continuing divisions within party ranks. Though
lawmakers and aides gave few details, both the Democratic and
Republican plans appeared likely to be split about evenly
between spending cuts and tax increases.
   Late yesterday, congressional Republicans endorsed as
their opening shot a $53 billion fiscal 1991 plan that was
little changed from a proposal prepared by White House Budget
Director Richard Darman in July. Roughly half of the proposed
savings would come from higher revenues and user fees, about
$15 billion from cuts in entitlement programs, notably
Medicare, and a net of about $4 billion from other domestic
programs.
   Both sides appear to support some kind of increases on
"sin" taxes. Democrats were talking about raising excise
taxes on liquor and tobacco, while Republicans will propose
higher taxes on beer and wine only. By omitting tobacco, the
GOP reflected a recent campaign pledge by President Bush in
North Carolina.
   In addition, Democrats were moving toward proposing a
broad tax on energy consumption and adopting their long-held
position to lift the top tax rate on the richest Americans to
33% from 28%.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) indicated
Republicans were considering tax incentives for oil
production, a move that would lose revenue. At least some
Democrats also were suggesting a fee on imported oil as a way
of helping domestic production.
   The Republican plan also will apparently propose to expand
tax breaks for individual retirement accounts and limit the
deduction for state and local income tax payments. It also
will propose cutting the capital-gains tax rate, which would
boost revenue in the first year. The Democrats don't intend
to support the capital gains tax, at least initially.
   For defense spending, Republicans will propose about $5
billion in cuts, while Democrats, at least initially,
supported cuts of more than twice that size. Still in
question was the accounting for the costs of stationing U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia, which Mr. Darman has estimated at $3
billion over the next six months.
   Given the Mideast crisis, Republicans feel confident that
defense cuts won't be so great as Democrats would like. But
in turn, Democrats would demand fewer domestic cuts than
Republicans. Since both sides have tentatively agreed to
balance spending cuts and tax increases, any erosion in
spending cuts would reduce proposed new revenues. The result
could be a deficit-trimming package as small as $25 billion.
   Serious questions remain whether any package will emerge
from the weekend meetings, and yesterday's news conferences
seemed designed in part for each side to try to establish its
own good faith should talks collapse.
   "We can't guarantee for you that something's going to
happen," said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,
Mo.), who chairs the bipartisan negotiations. But, he added,
the across-the-board spending cuts that threaten after Oct. 1
if Congress and the Bush administration don't reach agreement
"would be a very bad and poor outcome."
   One negotiator, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R.,
Ga.), said the greater pressure for a solution was on
Democrats, who control Congress. "How would you like the
president to announce that he's able to work with Mubarak,
he's able to work with Gorbachev, he's able to work with all
22 of our allies in the Persian Gulf, but the Congress and
Saddam Hussein are the two groups he doesn't seem to be able
to work with?" Mr. Gingrich asked.
   The difficulties ahead for negotiators were underscored
when Mr. Gingrich used a luncheon speech to restate his
intention to push a package of tax cuts. Though he put the
revenue loss at $18 billion over five years, other estimates
put a cost at $85 billion over that period.
   Mr. Gingrich reiterated his criticism of congressional
Democrats, particularly Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, and his opposition to tax increases. Mr. Mitchell
dismissed the remarks. Alluding to the president's
acknowledgement that revenue increases will be necessary, the
Senate leader said "President Bush has one view and Rep.
Gingrich appears to have another."
   Campaigning in Topeka, Kan., for Republican candidates
yesterday, President Bush avoided the Democrat-bashing that
marked campaign appearances earlier this summer. "The time
for partisanship, in my view, is past, and the time for
avoiding the tough decisions is gone," Mr. Bush said.
Referring to congressional leaders of both parties, he added,
"They're not going to do it {reduce the deficit} exactly the
way I want, and I understand that."
