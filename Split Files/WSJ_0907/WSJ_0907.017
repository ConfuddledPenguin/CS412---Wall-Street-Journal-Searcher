   A bunch of hours I have shot
   From the allotment I have got
   In pulling handles, quite in vain,
   Or pushing them, with zero gain,
   Until I see what I abhor:
   The sign that says "Use Other Door."

   It's time to be concerned about the increase in air
traffic. Considering all the holding patterns and stack-ups
over airports, one wonders if there aren't more people over a
city than in it.
