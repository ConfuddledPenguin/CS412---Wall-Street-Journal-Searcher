   NEW YORK -- Bond prices barely budged as investors again
shrugged off rising oil prices and braced for today's
potentially market-moving employment report.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/8 point
higher, a gain of just $1.25 for bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, fell to 8.95% from 8.96% on
Wednesday. Short-term securities ended unchanged to slightly
lower.

   But trading was very light. "Everyone is waiting for the
employment report," said Philip Braverman, senior vice
president and chief economist at DKB Securities Corp.
   "There was barely any movement in price and barely any
activity on the trading floors," said Kevin Logan, chief
economist at Swiss Bank Corp. of America.
   The employment report has become one of the market's most
potent economic indicators, with the ability to dramatically
sway bond market sentiment and cause wild gyrations in bond
prices. Because of this potential, trading often slows ahead
of the report's release.
   Among other things, investors hope to find clues about the
future direction of interest rates and Federal Reserve
monetary policy. There is widespread speculation that if the
report shows clear signs of economic weakness -- rising
unemployment or slow jobs growth -- the Federal Reserve may
reduce short-term interest rates in an effort to stave off an
economic recession.
   But if the jobs report is ambiguous, the future direction
of interest rates remains uncertain.
   A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists
expects nonfarm payrolls rose 83,000 in August, excluding the
layoff of census workers, in marked contrast to the growth in
payrolls early this year and in 1989.
   With the possibility of the Fed easing dominating market
talk, other events had little impact. The market largely
brushed aside a rise in oil prices. October oil futures ended
the day at $31.43 a barrel, up $1.66 at the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments also failed to
inspire trading interest. In a written response to questions
from the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that if
credit conditions tightened further, the central bank "might
find it appropriate to adjust policy."
   Meanwhile, the World Bank plans to sell its third global
bond issue in the next few weeks, with an offering that will
total between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
   As with the prior issues, the new securities are designed
to trade globally 24 hours a day and will be underwritten and
distributed simultaneously in Europe, the U.S. and Japan.
   A group of 15 investment dealers will bring the issue to
market, with West Germany's Deutsche Bank Capital Markets
Group and the U.S.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. serving as joint
lead managers.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
97 27/32, up from 97 22/32 on Wednesday while the yield eased
to 8.95% from 8.96%. The latest two-year notes ended at 100
4/32, down slightly from 100 5/32 on Wednesday while the
yield rose to 8.04% from 8.02%.
   Short-term rates were little changed. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.39% for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.61% while the rate on six-month bills
ended at 7.33% to yield 7.70%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Resolution Trust Corp.'s liquidation of nearly $30
million in junk bonds did little to rattle the high-yield
market.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged
to about 1/4 point lower.
   A spokesman for the RTC, the government agency set up to
bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, confirmed that the
agency was in the market selling about $30 million in
high-yield high-risk securities.
   Although the spokesman declined to specify which bonds the
RTC liquidated, market participants said they were
high-quality, liquid issues. "They were all names the market
wanted to buy, and were absorbed easily by the market," said
one high-yield trader.
   Among the names on the RTC's bid list were junk bonds of
Duracell Holdings Corp., Coltec Industries and Playtex Family
Products, market sources said.
   Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, junk bonds of
Burlington Holdings Inc. continued to weaken on concerns that
the textile maker will be financially squeezed if a recession
materializes.
   Burlington's 14.25% subordinated debentures, due in 1999,
were quoted at 67, down two points, while the company's
13.875% subordinated debentures, due in 1996, were quoted at
72, down two points.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 1/8 point higher in
very quiet trading.
   The market for new issues was moderately busy, with more
than $402 million of new debt priced.
   The most talked about issue yesterday was an $84 million
offering by the New York City Industrial Development Agency
on behalf of American Airlines Inc. via a group led by Bear
Stearns &amp; Co. The 29-year and 30-year bonds were priced to
yield 8.06% and 8.07%, respectively. American Airlines is a
unit of AMR Corp.
   Analysts said yields for the bonds were relatively high
for an issue that is largely tax-exempt, a reflection of the
market's trepidations about the long-term prospects of the
airline industry. Still, the attractive yields lured large
numbers of both institutional and individual investors and
allowed underwriters to reprice the bonds and lower the
yields from initial levels of 8.12% and 8.13%.
   Although the bonds are subject to alternative minimum tax,
a manager at Bear Stearns said the bonds are
triple-tax-exempt for residents of New York state. For
investors whose income from the bonds would be fully tax
exempt, the yields on the American Airline bonds would
translate into a taxable equivalent yield of over 11%.
   "The good news is that the yield is very attractive," said
Bruce Whiteford, manager of fixed-income trading at Chase
Manhattan U.S. Private Banking. "But given the long maturity,
uncertainty of where interest rates are going and concerns
about the airline industry, these could be very volatile
bonds," he said.
   Mr. Whiteford estimates that if interest rates rise
one-half percentage point, the price of these bonds would
fall about five points, or about $50 for each $1,000 face
amount.
   The proceeds from the bond sale will be used to refurbish
and rebuild certain areas at New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy
airports.
   Among benchmark issues yesterday, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% bond due 2018 were unchanged at 98 1/2 to
yield 7.31%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities showed slight gains in late trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for September delivery was quoted at 98 23/32, up 4/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue and Federal
National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for September
delivery both were up 3/32, at 98 8/32 and 98 26/32,
respectively.
   The primary market experienced a slight upswing in real
estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic, issuance.
   Citibank N.A., a Citicorp unit, announced a $350 million
Fannie Mae 90-121 issue, backed by Fannie Mae's 9 1/2%
securities. Nomura Securities announced a $300 million Fannie
Mae 90-122 issue, also backed by Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% issue.
   First Boston Corp. announced First Boston Mortgage
Securities Corp. 1990-1, a $137 million Remic collateralized
by whole loans.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese bond market, already reeling from a renewed
rise in oil prices and higher short-term interest rates,
deteriorated further yesterday on news that a U.S. citizen
was shot in the Middle East.
   The yield on the benchmark No. 119 10year bond rose to
nearly 8.3%, but eased late in the day to end at 8.24%. The
price of the benchmark issue closed at 82.50, down 0.37
points. (When calculated using the semi-annual compound
method to compare yields across markets, the yield on the No.
119 bond ended at 7.56%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   The State Department said an American citizen was shot and
wounded in Kuwait City by Iraqi police while trying to evade
capture at his apartment. News of the shooting weakened the
Japanese stock market and lifted the dollar.
   Major European bond markets ended higher in light trading.
