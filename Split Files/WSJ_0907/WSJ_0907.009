   ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. said it
will build a hydrogen plant in Geismar, La., and expand its
30-mile hydrogen pipeline there to serve the Geismar
chemicals complex operated by BASF Corp.
   Air Products said the new plant, which is expected to be
operating by the fall of 1991, would initially produce more
than 15 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen daily. A
company spokesman declined to say how much the plant will
cost to build.
