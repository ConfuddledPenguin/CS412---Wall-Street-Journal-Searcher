   GAF Corp. said it received a commitment letter from four
banks for $800 million of long-term senior financing to
refinance debt incurred in its 1989 management buy-out.
   The refinancing, by Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of New
York, Bank of Nova Scotia and Banque Paribas, is expected to
close next month and will enable GAF to redeem $50 million
outstanding of senior subordinated increasing-rate notes due
March 15, 1994, the company said. The notes carry an interest
rate of 16.5%. Terms of the new bank financing are under
negotiation, a GAF spokeswoman said.

   The Wayne, N.J., maker of specialty chemicals and building
materials retired $235 million of the increasing-rate notes
this year as well as $200 million of senior debt after the
sale of its surfactant business to a limited partnership
headed by a unit of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France.
   The agreement with the banks permits the company, after
the closing of the refinancing, to begin an exchange offer
for all or a portion of the company's subordinated merger
debentures, which public holders of GAF received in the 1989
buy-out and whose aggregate principal amount, together with
accrued interest, was $239 million as of June 30, GAF said.
