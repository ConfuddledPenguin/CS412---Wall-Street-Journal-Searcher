   DIBOLL, Texas -- Temple-Inland Inc. reported net income
rose 24% in the second quarter because of a decrease in tax
rates, despite lower operating earnings in most of its
businesses.
   Earnings rose to $65.7 million, or $1.18 a share, from
$52.9 million or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $587 million from $489 million.

   In the first six months, net rose 19% to $127.9 million,
or $2.30 a share, from $107.4 million, or $1.94 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.2 billion from $963 million.
   The company's container and containerboard group, its
largest segment, said operating earnings declined about 26%
in the quarter. Temple-Inland said that though box shipments
"remained strong," average selling prices of corrugated
cardboard declined and manufacturing costs increased.
Bleached paperboard earnings also declined.
   The company's financial services group, however, reported
operating earnings of $15.1 million compared with $1.1
million a year earlier. The company said Guaranty Federal
Savings Bank contributed $7 million to operating earnings.
The tax savings that boosted earnings for the quarter came as
a result of tax benefits associated with the purchase of
Guaranty.
