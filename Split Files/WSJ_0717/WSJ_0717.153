   Prices.
   That's the way that John O'Riley, a retired assistant
managing editor of this newspaper, once started a column. The
piece moved on from there, of course, but Mr. O'Riley wanted
to be sure he had focussed the readers' minds.

   He had reason to be careful. Prices can be a very dull
subject when they're not moving much. Economics graduate
students love to play around with theories and equations
dealing with the economy. Although much of economics would be
meaningless without accurate measurement of prices, there is
relatively little research about how prices are actually
measured.
   Theodore W. Schultz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, once
summed up the problem this way, "There is much to be said in
favor of the recent impressive advances in quantitative
techniques but to benefit from them there must be a real
commitment to measurement. For want of commitment, we abide
the lack of adequate data which greatly limits the usefulness
of these new techniques. . . . Very few university economists
are engaged in `making data' that will stand up under strong
empirical analysis." For that quotation, I am indebted to
Robert J. Gordon, a university economist of whom Prof.
Schultz surely must approve. Prof. Gordon, who teaches at
Northwestern, labored for nearly two decades to produce a
book with the unsexy title, "The Measurement of Durable Goods
Prices" (National Bureau of Economic Research). Prof.
Gordon's wife, he tells us, came to refer to the project as
his NVER book.
   To revert to O'Riley-style, Who cares? If Prof. Gordon is
right, a great many people ought to care. His figures
indicate that the rise in durable goods prices in the 1947-83
period was much slower than the official figures indicate. A
couple of results: Capital equipment investment, in
inflation-adjusted terms, has risen more rapidly than we
thought -- and so has durable goods productivity.
   The problem with the official measures is that they have
failed to account for much of the improvement in the quality
of consumer and business durable goods. Businesses are
turning out goods that are lighter, faster, more
energy-efficient and more reliable than their predecessors,
and they haven't received anything like full credit for it.
   One example: computers. In the early 1950s electronic
computers began appearing on commercial markets, and the
world has never quite been the same. For more than two
decades, government statisticians figured computer prices
remained about unchanged. After all, this year's machine cost
the same as last year's. That was true enough, but for a long
time the official measures didn't acknowledge that this
year's machine could do far more than last year's.
   In a benchmark revision in 1985, the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Economic Analysis introduced a deflator for the
computer component of producers' durable equipment dating
back to 1969. When quality was taken into account, it was
apparent that the true prices of computer services had fallen
sharply. The national income and product accounts still
assume that computer prices remained fixed before 1969. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Prof. Gordon says in his book,
still includes no price index for computers in its producer
price index.
   Computers, of course, are something of a special case. But
Prof. Gordon's research indicates a broad, if often less
spectacular, improvement in quality -- much of which has not
been picked up by official price measurements.
   Measuring prices, important as it is, isn't easy.
Government agencies struggle against obstacles that academic
researchers do not face. The Bureau of Labor Statistics,
which has primary responsibility for the consumer and
producer price indexes, cannot revise earlier numbers because
the figures are used to escalate legal price and wage
contracts. So it must push on into the future, looking for
better procedures, even if it knows that numbers for past
periods are wrong.
   The Bureau of Economic Analysis has no such curb on
historical research; in fact, it makes major benchmark
revisions every five years. But BEA has other
responsibilities, and Prof. Gordon figures historical
research ranks low on its list.
   To complicate matters, Congress from time to time hands
the agencies chores that must be done, whether or not there
is still any interest in the results. Each month, for
example, BLS must report the number of "discouraged workers,"
a statistic that Congress once wanted because some members
were surprised that the official unemployment rate was so
low. Few people monitor the number now, but BLS must still
collect the data.
   Whatever the problems, Prof. Gordon is convinced that the
agencies could do a better job. He hopes that his 723-page
book will be a starting point for more research. His new
indexes cover a wide range of durable goods and provide more
quality adjustments than the official numbers. But they do
not touch on nondurable goods or on the biggest puzzle of
all, services.
   The Gordon study indicates that durable goods producers
have been more productive in the postwar years than we
thought. Mr. Gordon's research, however, does little to
explain why overall productivity has slowed in the post-1973
period.
   Prof. Gordon offers a long list of quality improvements he
did not manage to deal with in his book. For example, the
reduced noise and vibration of jet planes has cut the need
for attendants to deal with air sickness. The jet planes can
fly above thunder storms and their safety record has been
superior to that of piston planes.
   Prices, as Mr. O'Riley would admit, are hard to figure,
and perfection is unattainable. But their significance
suggests that we should do a better job than we do now.
