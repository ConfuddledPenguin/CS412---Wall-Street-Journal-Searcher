   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- A state court jury here ordered
General Electric Capital Corp. to pay $70.8 million in
damages to a small aircraft retrofitter that claims it was
nearly put out of business when the General Electric Co. unit
pulled the plug on financing for a joint venture between the
companies.
   The jury awarded the Van Nuys-based retrofitter, American
Aviation Industries Inc., $65 million in compensatory damages
and $5.8 million in punitive damages against GE Capital, plus
ownership of engine housings from the venture valued at about
$1.5 million. On counterclaims, the jury awarded GE Capital
and its parent $9.8 million for loans owed it by American
Aviation plus engines and an aircraft valued at an additional
$6 million.

   "GE Capital regards the awards to AAI of compensatory and
punitive damages as unwarranted and is confident that they
will be set aside in further proceedings," GE Capital said.
   American Aviation was set up in late 1983 by Aviation
Consultants Inc., an aircraft leasing concern, with the
intention of retrofitting aging aircraft with new,
longer-range engines. In 1984, American Aviation entered into
a joint venture agreement with GE to retrofit Lockheed Corp.
JetStar corporate aircraft with GE turbofan engines that
would allow the aircraft to make transoceanic flights.
   The updated aircraft, called FanStars, would have cost
one-third to one-half as much as comparable planes, American
Aviation said, and the company estimated that the project
could bring in profit of as much as $105 million. All that
was needed was an investment of about $23 million to get the
aircraft refitted and certified by the Federal Aviation
Administration. GE Capital provided financing.
   But in early 1987, GE Capital began to tighten the purse
strings, claiming that its studies showed that only 20 of the
retrofitted aircraft could be sold instead of the 75 or so
originally projected. GE Capital required American Aviation's
owners to put up 100% of their stock as collateral for a $2.5
million loan, then refused to fund the loan without
concessions from management, American Aviation said.
   The small company's efforts to arrange alternative
financing through Advest Corp. and a separate investor group
fell through when GE Capital argued against it with potential
investors, American Aviation has claimed. In the end, the
FanStar was never certified, and no retrofitted planes were
sold.
   The jury in the case found against GE Capital for breach
of contract and "intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage."
