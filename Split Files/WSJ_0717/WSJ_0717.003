   WASHINGTON -- A group of investors holding 11.6% of the
stock of Justin Industries Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, said it
hired PaineWebber Inc. as a financial adviser in its effort
to acquire the brick, building materials and boot company.
   The group, led by Perry H. Sutherland and Barry S.
Rosenstein, also laid out its plans for Justin in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The group said
it would sell or close the company's unprofitable businesses,
which it lists as Featherlite Building Products, Tradewinds
Technologies and Northland Publishing. Mr. Sutherland said
the sales would leave Justin in its core businesses of boot,
brick and some industrial equipment manufacturing.

   In addition, the group said it would sell excess real
estate assets and other investments and cut costs by reducing
overhead and possibly by consolidating facilities.
   The group also filed a counterclaim in federal court in
Texas, alleging that Justin officials and its board violated
proxy regulations by failing to disclose adequately the
compensation of John Justin, company chairman. The
counterclaim also alleges that the company's proxy materials
didn't disclose severance packages guaranteed its officers.
   The countersuit seeks invalidation of the election of
directors at the most recent annual meeting, invalidation of
the severance agreements, the holding of a new meeting and
dissemination of more information. Mr. Justin declined to
comment on the suit or the plan filed with the SEC.
   The countersuit was filed in answer to a suit filed by
Justin against the group in June. In that suit, Justin
alleged that the group didn't disclose in its initial filing
with the SEC in November that it intended to try to acquire
Justin. In March, Justin rejected an $18.50 a share, or
$140.5 million offer from the group.
