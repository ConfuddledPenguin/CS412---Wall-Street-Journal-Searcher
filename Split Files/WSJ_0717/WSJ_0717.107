   A judge in Cleveland, Ohio, threw out the bribery case
against Rite Aid Corp. and its president, Martin L. Grass,
saying evidence and testimony produced during two weeks of
trial were insufficient.
   After oral arguments yesterday morning and three hours of
deliberations, Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge
Lillian Greene ruled that evidence against Mr. Grass was
circumstantial and that the defense had supplied "a
reasonable theory of innocence."

   In her ruling, Judge Greene in effect told prosecutors
that their case was too weak to send to a jury. She said
there was "no direct evidence to prove purpose" in the
prosecution's case.
   The verdict surprised prosecutors, who finished presenting
their case against Mr. Grass last week and were preparing for
his defense yesterday. Because the ruling amounts to an
acquittal, it can't be appealed.
   The ruling is likely to lift a cloud that has been hanging
over Rite Aid for more than a year. This week, a number of
Wall Street analysts said the company's stock has been
depressed by the trial. In composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid shares closed at $37.50, up
$1.125.
   Alex Grass, chairman and chief executive officer of Rite
Aid, the largest drugstore chain in the country, expressed
satisfaction that his company and his son, Martin, have been
acquitted by the judge.
   Martin Grass, president and chief operating officer, was
arrested and charged with bribery in April 1989 after local
investigators videotaped him paying about $33,000 to Melvin
T. Wilczynski, a member of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy,
allegedly to obtain his resignation. The board licenses and
regulates the operations of drugstores in the state. Rite Aid
owns more than 250 stores in Ohio.
   Prosecutors maintained that the payment to Mr. Wilczynski,
as well as an offer of $34,000 in health insurance benefits
and the use of a Rite Aid car, were part of a scheme to pack
the pharmacy board in favor of Rite Aid.
   Investigators with the Cuyahoga County sheriff's office
videotaped Martin Grass while he met with Mr. Wilczynski in a
Cleveland airport hotel room. Martin Grass handed Mr.
Wilcyznski the check and six variously worded and undated
letters of resignation addressed to Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste.
   According to the videotape, the two discussed the terms of
the resignation, and Mr. Wilczynski signed one of the
letters. Mr. Grass was heard saying that the resignation
would be delayed to avoid the appearance of impropriety.
   Rite Aid consistently denied any "wrongful intent" and
attacked Mr. Wilczynski's honesty during the trial. Mr.
Grass's attorney, George J. Moscarino, of the Cleveland firm
of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, maintained that the payment
was a legitimate buy-out of an existing contract that Mr.
Wilczynski had with Lane Drug Co., a company that Rite Aid
acquired in early 1989.
   Prosecutors suffered what legal experts viewed as a
serious setback during the trial. Judge Greene ruled
inadmissible the transcripts of several telephone
conversations between Messrs. Grass and Wilczynski that set
the stage for their videotaped meeting in Cleveland.
   According to the transcripts, Mr. Grass told Mr.
Wilczynski that Rite Aid had received a commitment from Gov.
Celeste's office to appoint a board member who would better
represent Rite Aid's interests.
   Gov. Celeste has denied making any such commitment.
   Defense lawyers cross-examining Mr. Wilczynski homed in on
his practice of billing both the pharmacy board and Lane Drug
for travel expenses. Mr. Wilczynski also did not report the
reimbursements by the state as income to the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Judge Greene limited her opinion to the state's burden of
proof, ruling that the state's own witnesses supplied a
"reasonable theory of innocence," meaning that the meeting in
the hotel room was for plausibly legitimate business reasons.
   "We had a civil negotiation going on, and that's what the
judge found," said Mr. Moscarino, Martin Grass's lawyer.
   Martin Grass, noting that he has a civil suit pending
against Mr. Wilczynski as a result of the charges, said he
was "set up" by investigators and Mr. Wilczynski but is
"pleased that we have been completely exonerated."
