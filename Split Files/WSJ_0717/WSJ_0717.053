   PARIS -- Bernard Tapie, announcing details of his plan to
buy 80% of Adidas AG, said he is paying 1.6 billion francs
($289 million). But he also disclosed he will have to pump in
as much as one billion francs more to bolster the capital of
the ailing West German sporting-goods concern.
   Analysts had valued all of Adidas at around three billion
francs. Mr. Tapie has insisted that he received a special
price.

   Mr. Tapie also disclosed that he is raising all the 1.6
billion francs through a package of one-year and two-year
loans from eight French, West German and Japanese banks. He
initially said only half the money would come from loans, and
the other half from other sources, such as asset sales by his
holding company, Bernard Tapie Finance S.A. Mr. Tapie's
statement said no such sales have been arranged.
   The statement outlining the price and financing plans
quieted worries that the flamboyant financier would have
trouble paying for Adidas, which will cost him nearly twice
Bernard Tapie Finance's 889 million-franc market
capitalization. But it also indicated that the loans'
repayment will depend on Adidas generating funds by rapidly
returning to profit. It also will depend on raising 600
million francs for Bernard Tapie Finance, half through a
stock issue and half through a bond issue.
   Last year, Adidas reportedly posted a 120 million mark
($72 million) loss on 4.6 billion marks in sales. This year,
Mr. Tapie said, he expects an Adidas net income of 70 million
francs to 100 million francs. Banking people say he expects
even more Adidas profit in 1991.
   Mr. Tapie didn't say how he will raise the one billion
francs in new Adidas capital. Banking people said he may well
sell some of his Adidas stake to new shareholders, which
could include some of the banks backing the purchase.
   Mr. Tapie's statement said the Adidas capital boost is
needed because the company's bad 1989 results had pushed debt
too high compared to capital. It didn't provide figures.
   Mr. Tapie's statement said he doesn't intend to sell any
major Adidas assets, lay off any workers or close any major
industrial sites, aside from changes already decided by
current management. But he told a radio interviewer that he
will need to restructure Adidas to make it more competitive,
and banking people said he may have to sell some
subsidiaries.
   Philippe Migeot, deputy managing director of Mr. Tapie's
lead bank, Credit Lyonnais subsidiary Societe de Banque
Occidentale, said one billion francs of the loan is repayable
in two years, while 600 million francs is repayable in one
year.
   The one-year loan is to be repaid through a 300 million
franc share issue and a 300 million franc bond issue for
Bernard Tapie Finance. Mr. Tapie told his bankers he intends
to buy most of the new shares himself to keep his current
controlling 57% stake in Bernard Tapie Finance. It couldn't
be learned how he would raise the money to do that.
   The one billion franc two-year loan is to be repaid
through Adidas earnings, Bernard Tapie Finance earnings, and,
if necessary, asset sales, Mr. Migeot said. Last year,
however, Bernard Tapie Finance's consolidated net income fell
54% to just 27.7 million francs.
   French stock market regulators, criticial of Mr. Tapie's
earlier failure to explain how he would finance the
acquisition, had ordered trading in Bernard Tapie Finance
suspended last week. After the release of Mr. Tapie's
statement, they said the shares could resume trading, as of
today.
