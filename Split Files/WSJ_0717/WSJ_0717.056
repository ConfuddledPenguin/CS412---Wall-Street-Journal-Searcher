   International Business Machines Corp. reported a solid
5.2% increase in second-quarter earnings, the first time
since the mid-1980s that the company has put together
respectable quarters back to back.
   "While first-half results are encouraging, much remains to
be done this year," IBM Chairman John Akers said in a
statement that was slightly more measured than the one that
accompanied the first-quarter earnings report.

   IBM did exceed securities analysts' expectations for the
second consecutive quarter, reporting net income of $1.41
billion, or $2.45 a share, while analysts had generally
estimated $2.25 to $2.35 a share. A year earlier, IBM earned
$1.34 billion, or $2.31 a share. (Per-share earnings grew
faster than the total figure because IBM has been buying back
shares, cutting the average number outstanding to 573.3
million from 581.4 million a year earlier.) Revenue climbed a
surprisingly strong 8.4%, to $16.5 billion from $15.21
billion.
   The biggest surprise in the quarter was the strength of
software revenue, which grew 26% to $2.35 billion. Although
software revenue had increased a heady 30% to 35% for years,
growth had recently slowed into the single digits as IBM had
begun providing hefty discounts on software as a way of
increasing hardware sales. IBM indicated that the strong
showing was an aberration but suggested that percentage
increases in the mid-teens were possible in the second half.
   IBM said results continued to be good in personal
computers, where IBM has been gaining market share for the
past year and a half. Demand also remained strong for a line
of high-end disk drives that IBM began shipping late last
year. IBM also singled out for praise the AS/400, a line of
minicomputers that had been going gangbusters since its
introduction two years ago but that had finally seemed to be
losing momentum in the first quarter.
   Revenue rose again in the U.S., even though the whole
computer industry has been having trouble here for years --
although the increase was apparently in the low single
digits, as opposed to the double-digit growth of the first
quarter and the 1989 second quarter.
   IBM also said it is seeing some early benefits from a
job-reduction and plant-consolidation program that occasioned
a $2.4 billion write-off in the 1989 fourth quarter. Benefits
from the program are expected to really start to show up in
the second half.
   At the same time, IBM acknowledged that 20 cents a share
of the latest quarter's earnings came from the drop in the
dollar -- because IBM does nearly 60% of its business
overseas, and a drop increases the value of that business
when it is translated into dollars.
   In addition, operating profit margins were disappointing.
Profit before taxes, interest expense and other income was
just 15.7% of revenue, while many securities analysts had
been predicting the margin would be at least half a
percentage point higher. The difference apparently came
because a heavier-than-expected percentage of revenue came
from products such as personal computers, where profit
margins are lower than on the big systems.
   The decline in mainframe revenue wasn't a big surprise,
given that a manufacturing problem in the 1989 first quarter
packed far more deliveries into last year's second quarter
than are normal. Still, IBM indicated that second-quarter
mainframe revenue was flat compared with this year's first
quarter -- even though the second quarter typically accounts
for 25% of mainframe revenue and the first 15%.
   In the first half, IBM earned $2.45 billion, or $4.26 a
share, up 6.8% from $2.29 billion, or $3.92 a share. Revenue
climbed 9.8% to $30.68 billion from $27.94 billion.
