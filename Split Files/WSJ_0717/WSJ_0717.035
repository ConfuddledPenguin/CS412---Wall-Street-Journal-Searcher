   Far-reaching legislation that extends the power of the
federal government and burdens American business with new
costs cleared Congress Friday. But don't expect a
presidential veto. On the contrary, the bill, which bans
discrimination against the disabled, passed with President
Bush's strong encouragement. Now Mr. Bush is eager to sign it
into law.
   There's an echo of an earlier administration in this
episode, as there is in the president's reversal on raising
taxes -- Richard Nixon's. The Bush presidency is regularly
likened to Ronald Reagan's or Gerald Ford's, but it is the
Nixon model (pre-Watergate, of course) that Mr. Bush is
following. The result: a moderate-to-conservative president,
but liberal government.

   Confronted with a hostile Congress dominated by liberal
Democrats, the Nixon-Bush strategy calls for selective
endorsement of liberal themes. Mr. Nixon did this on civil
rights, arms control, detente with the Soviet Union, the
environment and taxes. Mr. Bush has done it on all these,
plus disabled rights, minimum wage and child care. There's an
understandable political motive behind the strategy. Mr. Bush
wants to neutralize liberal issues that might be used against
him in 1992. And he's succeeding at this quite well.
   There's a downside. The conservative agenda that is
supposed to be Mr. Bush's blueprint for government has fallen
by the wayside. This wasn't Mr. Bush's intention, but it was
inevitable, given his strategy. Congress, controlled by
liberals, has tossed aside conservative issues and seized on
liberal ones that Mr. Bush supports (and thus are easier to
pass). So the Americans with Disabilities Act, the disabled
rights bill, was approved by Congress overwhelmingly and
extension of the Clean Air Act is nearing passage. But a cut
in the tax rate on capital gains and a constitutional
amendment outlawing flag desecration were defeated. Democrats
can argue, correctly, that they've been bipartisan and met
Mr. Bush halfway. They gobbled up the liberal half.
   That doesn't mean that they've actually warmed up to Mr.
Bush or are willing to give him any credit. They didn't like
Mr. Nixon either, no matter what he did. "In many ways Nixon
turned out to be a liberal president, but one who infuriated
liberals in the process," writes political analyst Michael
Barone in "Our Country," a political history of the past 60
years. "It is hard to think of things the federal government
could do which it wasn't already doing under Nixon," Mr.
Barone says. Still, liberals "were not inclined to charge
with overliberalism."
   One source of their animosity was the way Mr. Nixon
campaigned. As a candidate, he pressed conservative hot
buttons -- crime, the flag, national defense. Mr. Bush did
the same in 1988, stigmatizing Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis as a liberal weenie. Once elected,
these campaign themes did not become mandates driving the
Bush administration -- defense is an exception to this rule.
But liberals nevertheless remain angry over the 1988
campaign.
   One legacy of the campaign, the "no new taxes" vow, was
kept alive by Mr. Bush for 17 months. Liberals regarded it as
demagogic, and they had a point. The tax pledge was merely an
appealing theme for the administration, not a policy. Mr.
Bush's 1991 budget, for example, included nearly $14 billion
in new tax revenues. Mr. Bush has refused to use his national
pulpit to press Congress for enactment of a capital-gains
cut. (Mr. Nixon campaigned as pro-business, then doubled the
capital-gains rate in 1969.) When the House Ways and Means
Committee passed a cut in 1989, this was a spontaneous action
of Republicans and conservative Democrats. Mr. Bush had given
them no encouragement.
   Because only liberal issues succeed under the Nixon-Bush
strategy, Mr. Bush has been forced underground to press
conservative issues. Now his chief vehicle for protecting a
reasonable level of Pentagon spending, seeking domestic
spending cuts or entitlement reform, and gaining budget
process changes is private talks with Democratic
congressional leaders. Just to get these talks going, Mr.
Bush had to pay a price. He was required to drop his "no new
taxes" pledge. Even so, he got no promise from Democrats of
concessions on conservative issues.
   By relying on private negotiations, Mr. Bush avoids the
need to be publicly confrontional. Mr. Reagan, in contrast,
relished confrontation, and so his strategy was different. He
stuck to the conservative agenda (lower taxes, less domestic
spending, more military spending, an assertive,
anti-communist foreign policy) and left liberal issues alone.
He produced conservative government for six years.
   In his last two years, Mr. Reagan faltered. He dabbled in
the Nixon strategy with disastrous results. In 1988, Mr.
Reagan proposed a catastrophic health insurance program.
Congress responded by expanding the size and cost of the
program, but Mr. Reagan signed the bill anyway. Soon, elderly
citizens were staging noisy protests against the costly new
premiums required by the program.
   That should have been a lesson to Mr. Bush, particularly
after a coalition of conservatives and moderates in Congress
rose up in 1989 and eliminated the program. It wasn't. At Mr.
Bush's behest, White House chief of staff John Sununu now is
desperately seeking a compromise with liberals on the 1990
Civil Rights Act. Mr. Bush insists he doesn't want a bill
that will lead to quotas. But he doesn't want to veto the
bill and alienate the black leaders he's been courting
either. His solution is to split the difference by weakening,
but retaining, a provision likely to promote quotas.
   Like so many of Mr. Bush's policies, his stand on civil
rights bears an eerie resemblance to Mr. Nixon's. Mr. Nixon
didn't like quotas either, but in 1969, his administration
approved the so-called Philadelphia Plan for building trades
unions. It set a quota for black membership, but called it a
goal. "It was under Nixon that first the executive branch and
then the Congress explicitly endorsed what amounted to a
racial quota," Mr. Barone points out.
   The same is true with clean air legislation. In 1969, Mr.
Nixon proposed the creation of the Environmental Protection
Agency. Now Mr. Bush has worked out a compromise with
congressional Democrats for widening the power of the agency
through revisions of the Clean Air Act. EPA also will be
raised to Cabinet status. The bill gives EPA authority to
issue permits to as many as 150,000 American businesses, from
small dry cleaning shops to large industries, depending on
how well they contain any of 191 air pollutants. Without an
EPA permit, the businesses will have to shut down.
   Mr. Reagan managed to thwart new anti-pollution measures
simply by refusing to play along. He won re-election anyway.
Mr. Reagan sent no major environmental legislation to
Congress in his eight years, and none passed. Mr. Bush could
have gotten by with this approach. (It might have worked on
disabled and civil rights, too.) Revisions of the Clean Air
Act are not needed. The air, after all, is getting cleaner,
not dirtier.
   One irony of the Bush strategy is that the leading
conservative in the White House, Mr. Sununu, may have
negotiated the three most liberal pieces of legislation to
pass Congress in a decade -- the clean air, disabled rights,
and civil rights bills. The first two are certain to become
law this year, and the civil rights bill has a better than
50-50 chance.
   In the face of a record like that, it is safe to say that
the Nixon-Bush approach is not serving Republicans or
conservatives well. It may backfire on Mr. Bush in 1992 as
well. Bush is well positioned to claim the political center,
but the right is a potential trouble spot. Conservatives are
increasingly upset with the consequences of Mr. Bush's
presidency. He may face a challenge for the GOP nomination in
1992 (as Mr. Nixon did in 1972). No doubt Mr. Bush will win
(as Mr. Nixon did), but the fight won't aid his re-election.
   Mr. Bush's strong suit now is foreign policy. "He's gotten
a once-in-a-lifetime halo effect from events abroad," says
GOP consultant Jeffrey Bell. Mr. Bush is following Nixon's
detente model and has developed strong ties to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. But what if Mr. Gorbachev falls, and
events take a turn for the worse in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe? "A different trend abroad could bring a
surprisingly sudden reversal of his overall rating," argues
Mr. Bell.
   Mr. Nixon was saved in 1972 by having an extraordinarily
weak Democratic opponent, George McGovern. Mr. Bush may not
have that luxury. If Gov. Cuomo of New York announces early
next year for the Democratic nomination, he'll probably scare
off other candidates. Then, in 1992, he'd lead a united
Democratic party against divided Republicans. Would the folks
Mr. Bush has wooed with, say, the disabled rights bill, stick
with him against Mario Cuomo? Don't bet on it.
