   "For us to lose the Ukraine would be the same as losing
our head."
   -- V.I. Lenin, 1918

   LVOV, U.S.S.R. -- It is a sunny afternoon, and perfect
weather for tweaking the Communist Party's nose. Actually,
any weather is perfect for that in the Ukraine these days.
   In Lvov, the heart of the Ukraine's unruly west, the
tweaking gets particularly cheeky. On this day, for example,
factory workers dressed as Cossacks appear at a monument to a
Ukrainian freedom fighter beheaded in the 16th century. They
wheel up a homemade cannon and stuff shreds of Pravda, the
Communist Party newspaper, down its barrel. A bit of
gunpowder, a match and then a dog-scattering "kaBOOOOM]" In
the smoke, standing at stiff attention, 10 workers are
dressed in uniforms of a 1919 Ukrainian independence army --
a traitorous army, in Moscow's view.
   "We could have never gotten away with this a year ago --
we'd be in jail," a worker says proudly.
   Indeed, Ukrainians are giddily getting away with acts of
defiance that Moscow only last year promised never to allow
in the Soviet Union's largest republic aside from the Russian
republic. It is an industrial and farming region of 52
million people crucial to Soviet existence.
   Yesterday, the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev, voting 355 to
4, declared its sovereignty. The parliament asserted that
Ukrainian laws now take precedence over Soviet laws, and
announced that the republic planned to raise its own army and
issue its own money. The parliament stopped short of total
separation from the Soviet Union.
   The Ukraine move follows similar declarations in the
Russian Federation, Moldavia and Uzbekistan, and declarations
of outright independence by the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia. The Kiev vote, in a Parliament previously
dominated by pro-Moscow conservatives, demonstrates the
rapidly growing power of Ukrainian independence forces that
only began openly organizing last fall.
   Nowhere in the Ukraine are those forces as vociferous as
here in Lvov, a Communist hard-liner's nightmare of runaway
"perestroika" and crumbling party authority and prestige.
This lovely old city of cobblestone streets and centuries-old
houses and churches, Communists say, is a nest of anti-Soviet
and anti-party extremists. And they are correct.
   Liberal reformers say Lvov is their nightmare, too, with
party apparatchiks stubbornly resisting change in defiance of
both local sentiment and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
who last week charged that local party obstructionists were
playing into the hands of breakaway forces.
   He couldn't have been more right in Lvov's case. Here, a
democratic bloc won big majorities March 4 in city and
"oblast," or regional, councils, the top governing bodies
below the Parliament. But after 51 years of running
everything here, the Communists aren't about to let simple
voter sentiment push them around. They're sitting tight, more
or less in control of the police, militia, KGB, media,
factories, collective farms and transport. The democrats are
chipping away, often with more pluck than muscle.
   Lvov is a garden of grass-roots "glasnost." At a local
Hyde Park on the promenade in front of the Opera House,
newlyweds stop by to receive pre-honeymoon blessings from
elders in the Ukrainian independence movement. At the
movement's new office across from the Lenin Monument,
volunteers sort donated relief supplies destined for
Lithuania. At the new dissidents' kiosk, next to the
baked-goods kiosk, customers line up to buy movement flags,
buttons and dissident journals from across the Soviet Union.
   At last year's May Day parade, the ruling Communists
ordered police to shoo away pro-democracy marchers, with
their blue and yellow flags. This year, the new ruling
democrats wouldn't allow Communists into the parade. When
they complained of discrimination, the Communists were told
they had forgotten to apply for a parade permit.
   The democrats wanted live television coverage of the new
oblast council's first session, beginning April 9. The
Communists, still in control of the local TV station, said
no, pleading poverty. Within a week, the council got more
than 2.5 million rubles in donations from citizens demanding
live coverage. The station now covers the sessions
gavel-to-gavel.
   When a Red Army colonel-general arrived from Moscow last
month to announce the installation of a satellite tracking
station at a nearby base, the council said: Not so fast.
Where's your environmental-impact statement?
   The newly elected democrats lofted their blue and yellow
flags atop City Hall and the Oblast Building, symbolically
claiming the buildings and the government. Fine, said the
Communists, but we still control the office space inside.
   Vyacheslav Chernovil, a former dissident journalist
released from a labor camp only three years ago, now governs
Lvov Oblast, a Massachusetts-size region of 2.7 million
people, as chairman of the council. His deputy is Ivan Hel, a
religious leader imprisoned for 18 years, "not counting the
15 days I got last year for organizing a demonstration," he
says. "Now here I am. God does work in mysterious ways."
   Messrs. Chernovil and Hel and others met clandestinely
here on May 7, 1989, to form the Lvov chapter of the Popular
Movement in Support of Perestroika, or "Rukh," the Ukrainian
word for "Movement." While officially apolitical, it quickly
became an umbrella group for both pro-democracy and
pro-Ukrainian independence forces.
   They never could have won, Mr. Chernovil says, without the
Communist-controlled militia and police, who violently broke
up their demonstrations last year, thereby swelling the ranks
of Rukh. The democrats and nationalists won 170 of the 196
seats in the council. Communist Party members won 26 seats,
but 11 of them defected to the democrats on live TV,
diminishing Communist loyalists to an 8% minority.
   "They are three army officers, five factory directors,
three collective-farm chairman and four others," Dmitri Kos,
a democratic councilman, says of the Communists. "Their
voices aren't audible."
   In fact, in front of the TV cameras, they sat stone-faced
as the council doubled the size of private farm plots,
created Lvov time -- an hour earlier than Moscow time -- and
decreed that government officials, including judges, give up
membership in political parties while in office.
   The council is feeling its way. It spent a recent day
debating an "oppressed people" bill, which would restore
privileges to former political prisoners and others wronged
by the party over the decades.
   The oblast prosecutor, a party man, is summoned before the
TV cameras to explain how this is to be done. It won't be
easy, he says. The injured parties must be officially
rehabilitated under laws handed down from Kiev, Ukraine's
capital, and Moscow. That means the tens of thousands of
cases in his files have to be handled one by one, and he has
money for only 12 staffers to do the work. And the law on who
was a freedom fighter and who was a subversive is very fuzzy.
It will take years and years.
   "Legal gobbledygook," shouts a councilman. In the
meantime, he says, oppressed people should have the same
privileges as veterans, including the right to shop in
specially stocked veterans' stores.
   "Wait a minute," another councilman says. "You want the
repressors and the repressed in the same shops? That would be
pretty uncomfortable. I say give the repressed their own
shops."
   Chairman Chernovil interrupts. There's no money for
special shops, he says.
   At the moment, the formerly repressed would settle for a
little more office space in the Oblast Building, where the
new council's leaders and staff are wedged into offices on
the second floor swarming with giddy citizens never before
allowed on the premises. Now, uniformed guards shoo away
unexpected visitors from the Communist stronghold on the
third and fourth floors.
   "We don't have to give them anything," says Communist
Party First Secretary Vyacheslav Vasilyevitch Secretaryuk,
after welcoming the "comrades of the Western press" into his
spacious office for an interview. Secretary Secretaryuk is a
52-year-old party veteran who got the top job in April, after
his predecessor's humiliating election loss.
   "We have a perfectly legal five-year lease on this office
space," he explains, not mentioning that the party signed the
lease with itself. He does explain, however, that the party
is brimming with good will and generosity, in sharp contrast
to the riffraff below.
   "We want to cooperate," he says. "We offered them 17
offices on the fourth floor. They refused. They say they want
the third floor. They say they'll demonstrate if we don't
give in. I say fine, but please don't do it during working
hours. Productivity is low enough. They say if they don't get
their way, they'll strike. But they're the government now]
Who do they think they're striking against?"
   Secretary Secretaryuk notes that he stands shoulder to
shoulder with George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and other
Western leaders in believing that a fragmented Soviet Union
would be dangerously destabilizing for Europe and the world.
He is trying to do his little bit for stability, he says.
   "We're in crisis, so we must all work together for peace,"
he says. "But how can we work with these Rukh people when
they tell us that we are their political enemies?" At the
moment, the local Communist Party is battling enemies within.
Commanders at one of the city's five police districts have
quietly told the council they will obey council instead of
party orders.
   Defectors have abounded at the TV station ever since Oct.
1, when ace reporter Boris Kozlovsky came back with great
videotape of pro-democracy demonstrators being beaten by
police and his party bosses refused to put it on the air.
   "I couldn't stand it anymore," he says. "I became an
activist." He and other workers at the station began sneaking
clips of pro-democracy doings onto the air. "It was easy," he
says. "The bosses are lazy, they hardly ever watch. Once
people saw these things, pressure built to show more." Mr.
Kozlovsky still reports the news. He also makes it. He won a
seat on the council, where one of his first acts was to
resign from the party -- on live TV.
   "A lot of people aren't turning in their party cards who
want to," he says. "They think there might be a military coup
or something. And if that happens, of course, people who quit
the party will probably be the first to be shot. But I've
already lived 50 years. That's a lot."
   The Communist Party still publishes all the
non-underground newspapers sold in Lvov. But out at the
newsrooms and joint printing plant on the southern edge of
town, the party is losing its grip.
   On one floor, Lvov Pravda's editors and reporters are
trying to wrest financial control from the party, which they
say makes big profits but pays tiny salaries. Two floors up,
the paper of the Communist Youth League is in open revolt. It
used to be named Leninist Youth. Two months ago, its staff
changed the name to Young Galician, a reference to this
region's historical name, Galicia. The paper's popularity
soared when it began covering speeches and rallies of
pro-democracy candidates this spring, against party orders.
   "The first secretary in Kiev called us anti-Communist and
threatened to shut us down," a reporter says. "But this paper
has too much influence and too many readers for them to stop
us. It's just pressure tactics."
   Does this mean that the Communist Party can't even close
down one of its own newspapers, he is asked.
   "Look, the party doesn't even control the party," he says.
"The party isn't behind the wheel anymore." As he talks,
Stepan Kurpil, a party secretary, looks on sheepishly.
   "People finally realized the world revolves around the sun
and not Moscow," says Andrei Pidlisny, a cartoonist. "The
Central Committee may own the building and the presses," he
says, "but the pressmen are on our side."
   The pressmen also side with the council democrats, who
asked the party to give one of its newspapers to the council.
"We said, `You take Pravda, we'll take Free Ukraine,'" says
Vasily Basiv, a new councilman and former Transcarpathian
correspondent for a party paper. Free Ukraine is another
party paper.
   When the party refused, the pressmen raised the
blue-and-yellow Rukh flag over the printing plant and
threatened to shutdown all the party's papers. The party
offered a deal: The council could start a new paper.
Subscribers to Free Ukraine would re-subscribe either to it
or to the council paper.
   "After a couple of days it dawned on them that this was,
in effect, a referendum on the party vs. the council, and
they were losing badly," says Mr. Basiv. "So they canceled
the deal."
   Instead, the council announced that it would publish its
own eight-page tabloid, "For a Free Ukraine," on the party's
presses. Its subscription goal of 100,000 was met in three
days. As its editor, Mr. Basiv is busy organizing a staff for
what he says is Ukraine's first real independent newspaper.
He is seeking a non-interference pledge from the council and
preparing for Communist intimidation.
   "If the party threatens us, I can pick up the phone to
Rukh and within two hours there will be 200,000 people out
there on the street," Mr. Basiv says. "They could try
blackmailing us by withholding newsprint. We have two outs.
Lvov has a cardboard factory that could make newsprint out of
recycled paper. Or we could try to get newsprint from Western
sources." That would take hard currency, which Mr. Basiv says
he is eager to earn by selling ads in the West.
   "We'll print anything," he says with a laugh. "Our
hard-currency bank account is empty, so our standards are
very flexible."
   It was a lot easier being a dissident than it is running a
government, says Vasil Shpitser, 43-year-old chairman of the
new Lvov City Council. His City Hall desk is stacked high
with petitions and complaint letters from many of the city's
860,000 citizens who believe they finally have a city
government that will produce -- water, say. It's been years
since municipal taps ran more than a few hours a day.
   All day long, aggrieved citizens traipse into his office
with their problems. "A lot of people come in here and just
cry," he says. "They have been chronically abused. For years
and years nobody would listen to them."
   The five most common problems, he says, are "apartments,
apartments, apartments, apartments and apartments." Many
families have waited for new housing for more than a decade
while those with party connections jumped the queue. Others
paid bribes and, he says, "We're going to the prosecutor with
several cases."
   Down one more level of government, Mikhail Boichishin,
41-year-old chairman of one of Lvov's five district councils,
is almost nostalgic for his dissident days -- which didn't
end until the March 4 elections. Back then, he says, he
smuggled truckloads of the movement's underground newspapers
in from Lithuania, where they were printed. He sold movement
buttons and flags. Police knocked him down at demonstrations.
   Now he marches up front in parades, an honored guest. Now
he gives visitors a tour of his district, wheeling his tired
blue Moskvich sedan the wrong way down a one-way street,
asking, "Can the president of the United States do this?"
   He seems to like the power, but feels powerless. He is now
in charge of giving out new apartments in his district. The
waiting list has more than 7,000 names on it, but he will get
only 120 or so apartments each year to hand out. So every day
he has to say no to constituents who file into his office
pleading for them.
   "He's into real life now and he can't do anything," his
wife, Lyubomira, says over lunch in the apartment they waited
15 years for.
   "We're naked kings," he says with a scowl.
