   LONDON -- Industrial production fell 0.5% in May from
April levels and was up 3.1% from May 1989, according to
provisional data released yesterday by the U.K. Central
Statistical Office.
   Output in the energy sector, which can vary greatly with
swings in the oil market, fell 2.5% in May from April and was
up 6.8% from a year earlier. The latest figures compare with
April's 1.6% month-on-month rise and 1.2% year-on-year fall.

   Output in all industries rose 1.6% in the three months
ended in May from the preceding three months and was up 1.7%
from a year earlier.
   Output for manufacturing alone in the latest three months
was up 1.7% from the previous three months and was also up
1.7% from a year earlier.
   The statistical office said the rise in manufacturing
output was the first increase since January 1989. Meanwhile,
it noted energy production had fallen largely because of the
spate of warm weather earlier this year.
