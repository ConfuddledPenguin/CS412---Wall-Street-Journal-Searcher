   NEW YORK -- The dollar was narrowly mixed in active
trading as dealers sought to lock in gains on minor price
changes and scrambled to establish positions ahead of today's
U.S. trade report.
   Traders said the dollar fluctuations reflected neither
underlying economics nor news developments. "There was no
good reason to do anything to the dollar," said David Wilson,
a New York vice president for Girozentrale Vienna.

   The day's one consistent mover was the Swiss franc, which
declined against all major currencies on weekend rumors that
the Swiss National Bank is poised to ease monetary policy. A
spokesman said yesterday the central bank has no such
intention.
   The Swiss base interest rate was set at 10.75% yesterday,
a quarter of a percentage point below its level Friday.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6547 marks, up from 1.6510 marks late Friday in New York.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar was unchanged at
148.15 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.8040, above $1.8005
late Friday.
   The dollar climbed to 1.4180 Swiss francs from 1.4025
francs late Friday. The mark was last quoted at 0.8570 Swiss
franc, up from 0.8495 franc Friday. Sterling rose to 2.5581
Swiss francs from 2.5252 francs Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading
at 147.93 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 148.43 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6590 marks, up
from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6577 marks.
   The U.S. trade report could make for hectic North American
currency dealings this morning, said David Ogg, chief New
York dealer for Credit Suisse.
   The nation's trade deficit is estimated to have widened in
May to $7.7 billion from $6.94 billion in April.
   Initially, the dollar will be bought if the U.S.'s deficit
is smaller than expected and sold if that figure is larger
than anticipated. But the overall figure can be overshadowed
by movements in regional trade accounts or by volume changes
in either exports or imports.
   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust, said, "The dollar is undervalued against the European
currencies with which we have a trade surplus but overvalued
against Asian currencies with which we have a trade deficit."
   In April, the U.S. had a $1.36 billion surplus with
Western Europe. Its deficit with Japan was $3.95 billion.
   If today's figures disclose a continuance of that trend,
Mr. Kellner said, the U.S. currency will probably be sold
against Asian currencies, with the yen as an immediate proxy.
If the U.S.'s trade deficit with Asia was smaller in May than
April, the dollar should climb today.
   The greenback has less room to move against European
currencies, Mr. Kellner said, because investors currently are
focusing more on the small interest-rate differentials
between the U.S. and Europe than on trade.
   Mr. Kellner said he will also be looking for a continued
slowdown in export growth to confirm the weakness of the U.S.
economy. Some European foreign exchange dealers said they
will look at import growth for a signal of inflationary
pressures.
   June U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization
figures, also due today, will further gauge U.S. economic
expansion.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $363.30 an ounce, down $1.10. Estimated
volume was a light 2.3 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$361.75 an ounce.
