   TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank, embroiled in
a two-year investigation of its student loans, agreed to pay
the U.S. $17.9 million as part of a civil settlement.
   The settlement, disclosed by a U.S. attorney in Florida,
covers "false claims" filed with the Department of Education
by the thrift under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. That
program makes low-interest loans available to students for
college expenses.

   In 1988, Florida Federal, St. Petersburg, Fla., came under
scrutiny for allegedly filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent
insurance claims on $35 million in government-backed student
loans. The investigation helped spark a management shake-up
that resulted in the resignation of the thrift's chairman.
   Earlier this year, Florida Federal was fined $2,150,000
after its conviction on charges, including conspiracy and
filing false claims, related to the student-loan case. Two
former officers were also convicted of falsifying statements,
and a third has been indicted on several charges and awaits
trial.
   Florida Federal has also agreed to correct the records of
students whose credit standing was hurt by the fraud
committed by Florida Federal, the U.S. attorney's office
said.
   In St. Petersburg, Florida Federal officials couldn't be
reached.
