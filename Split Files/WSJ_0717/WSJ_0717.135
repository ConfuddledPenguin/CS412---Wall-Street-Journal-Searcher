   Alcoa of Australia Ltd., an alumina and aluminum company,
reported that first-half operating profit after taxes rose
5.2% to 395.9 million Australian dollars (US$308.5 million)
from A$376.2 million a year earlier.

   Revenue rose 7.6% to A$1.5 billion from A$1.4 billion.
   The company said profit improved mainly because of higher
alumina shipments, favorable gold mining operations, a weaker
Australian currency and higher interest income from
short-term investments. These improvements were partly offset
by lower aluminum prices and higher raw materials costs.
   Alcoa is one of Australia's largest exporters; it said it
accounts for more than 5% of the country's merchandise
exports.
   The outlook for the rest of this year looks sound, despite
some slowing in the U.S. economy, the company said. But Alcoa
warned that if the Australian dollar remains at its current
level, second-half earnings will be lower.
