   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
auditors for the first time conducted surprise visits to 30
radio and television stations, checking for compliance with
political-advertising rules.
   The agency expects to issue a report this summer after it
obtains information from the stations on their advertising
rates. After a similar spot audit of telephone operator
services in April, the FCC last month proposed more stringent
rules for that industry. Both audits were launched because
the agency suspected lax compliance with its rules.

   The FCC targeted four television and two radio stations in
each of five metropolitan areas: Cincinnati, Dallas-Fort
Worth, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. The
cities were chosen because they are spread across the country
and because stations in some of the markets serve two or
three states.
   Auditors checked each station's political file for the
1990 elections as well as advertising-rate data to ensure
compliance with political-programming rules. The rules
require stations to provide equal opportunity for all
candidates, so that if one candidate runs an ad, opponents
can buy the same amount of air time at the same time of day.
Other rules require stations to sell political advertising at
their lowest rates and to maintain a file of political
programming that is available to the public.
   The 30 stations have 20 days to answer FCC questions about
rates, supplying data on commercial and political
advertising.
