   Rising loan problems, especially on commercial real
estate, and a slowdown in corporate borrowing crippled
second-quarter earnings of several major banks.
   Chase Manhattan Corp. posted a 62% drop in earnings, while
at First Chicago Corp. and Bank of New York Co. earnings
tumbled 35% and 39%, respectively. Earnings at Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp. gained only 5.8% because
of loan problems, and New Jersey's Midlantic Corp. reported a
loss because of a large provision for possible future losses
on loans.

   NCNB Corp. also had a larger-than-expected addition to its
reserves for loan problems. However, earnings at the
Charlotte, N.C., bank were up 50% from a year earlier because
the latest quarter's results reflect its 100% ownership of
its Texas bank.
   Only New York-based J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., which plays a minor
role in real estate finance, reported shrinkage in problem
loans. However, slack corporate finance activity kept its
results about flat.
   If there was a silver lining in the results, it was that
there were no surprises. As James J. McDermott Jr., research
director of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said, "The market
anticipated generally weak results, and that's what was
served up."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
Manhattan fell 50 cents to $20.75. First Chicago closed at
$27.625, down $1. Security Pacific was off 12.5 cents to
$36.25. Bank of New York closed at $28.625, down 75 cents.
   J.P. Morgan shares made a strong showing, rising $2.125 to
$37.875, and NCNB rose $1.75 to $36.50. In national
over-the-counter trading, Midlantic closed up 62.5 cents at
$14.75.
                                                                                                       

   Chase Manhattan Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Problem real estate loans continued to mushroom at the
U.S.'s second largest banking company. Past-due real estate
loans as well as foreclosed properties rose 52% to $1.75
billion from $1.15 billion as of March 31.
   And Chase's comments offered no guarantee that an end to
the real estate woes is in sight. "If economic conditions in
domestic real estate markets continue to be adverse, it is
likely that the provision for possible credit losses will
continue at relatively high levels," it said.
   As a result, Chase's provision for loan-loss reserves for
the quarter was $225 million, identical to what was set aside
in the year's first quarter and $75 million more than the
provision for the year-earlier quarter. If the provision had
been the same as a year earlier, Chase's results would have
been on a par with those of last year's second quarter.
   Charge-offs of bad loans more than doubled to $763
million. That increase included $374 million in charge-offs
for Brazilian loans and $172 million for Argentine loans.
   The good news in Chase's results was that net interest
income rose 6% to $835 million on a taxable equivalent basis,
reflecting both higher margins and volume on consumer
lending. The rise was especially encouraging because the
year-earlier quarter included $36 million in Brazilian
interest payments and the latest quarter had none. The latest
net interest figure also was after a $22 million charge for
investment hedges that were sold.
   Other operating income rose slightly to $499 million on
the strength of higher consumer, investment banking and
fiduciary fees. Both foreign-exchange trading profit and
gains from the sales of securities were lower in the quarter.
                                                                                                       

   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Strong trading results on a variety of products,
especially swaps contracts and Third World debt, offset weak
net interest income and lagging fees from corporate finance.
   Trading results of $234 million were up 55% from a year
earlier, while fees from corporate finance, such as mergers
and acquisition advisory work, fell 27% to $61 million. Net
interest income fell 9% to $286 million, largely reflecting
the absence of Brazilian interest payments.
   Commenting on the quarter, Chairman Dennis Weatherstone
said: "Trading activities across the board have produced
excellent results, as they did in the first quarter. Fees
from corporate finance activities declined in a difficult
environment but still made a good contribution. Fees were
strong from investment management, private banking and
operational services -- business activities to which we look
for steady growth."
   Going counter to an industrywide trend, Morgan's loan
quality -- already the strongest in the industry -- continued
to improve. Non-accruing loans dropped 49% to $876 million.
In the quarter, Morgan charged off $120 million of Brazilian
loans and $77 million of Argentine loans. At the end of the
quarter, Morgan's medium-term and long-term loans to
countries involved in refinancing their bank debt totaled
$1.5 billion, less than half of what it was a year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   Security Pacific Corp.
                                                                                                       

   The Los Angeles company was hit by a fairly sharp increase
in credit problems linked to continuing problems in the
Arizona commercial real estate market and other areas. The
company cited rising non-interest income and limited expense
growth as favorable trends, but overall profitability, as
measured by return on assets, declined slightly to 0.89%. At
June 30, Security Pacific had $94.5 billion in total assets,
compared with $84.3 billion a year earlier.
   The company said loan charge-offs, excluding developing
country debt, rose to $159.6 million from $108.8 million a
year earlier and that the company's provision for future loan
losses rose to $160.7 million from $111.6 million.
   As of June 30, nonperforming loans and leases totaled
$1.87 billion, a 7% increase from March 31 and 14% higher
than a year earlier.
   Net interest income grew just 4%. The company said its net
interest margin declined to 3.90% from 4.07% because of the
sale of certain credit card loans, higher nonperforming loans
and narrower spreads between loan yields and the cost of
retail deposits.
                                                                                                       

   NCNB Corp.
                                                                                                       

   NCNB's earnings jump came despite a larger-than-expected
loss provision for problem loans. Per-share earnings,
however, rose only 30%, because this year's second quarter
had more shares outstanding after two stock offerings.
   The latest results included 100% of the operations of NCNB
Texas, formed from the remnants of failed First RepublicBank
Corp. in Dallas, compared with only a 49% ownership a year
earlier. NCNB wouldn't give details of the Texas bank's
bottomline contribution, but a spokesman said, "We had a very
strong quarter in Texas. The earning power in Texas is
everything we anticipated it would be."
   NCNB's earnings gain reflected tight expense controls and
a lower tax rate. Partly because of the addition of the
remaining stake in NCNB Texas, the bank holding company was
able to cut its tax rate to 10% from 26% a year earlier. That
translated into a tax bill of $15.7 million, down from $42.7
million.
   At the same time, blaming a slowing economy and weak real
estate markets, particularly in the Southeast, NCNB said it
significantly increased its allowance for loan losses in the
second quarter to $525.4 million, or about 1.46% of total
loans, from $394 million, or 1.20% of total loans, a year
earlier. Nonperforming assets were $695.2 million as of June
30, compared with $599.1 million as of March 31. At the end
of the 1989 second quarter, nonperforming assets stood at
$335.1 million.

   First Chicago Corp.
                                                                                                       

   First Chicago's results reflected the slowdown in the
commercial banking business. Real estate lending problems
also continued to depress profit.
   Loans for leveraged buy-outs, corporate refinancings and
other usually lucrative lending opportunities have become
scarce in recent months, while some older loans have become
troubled. The quarterly comparison would have been worse but
for a $13.5 million pretax gain from the sale of a credit
card merchant processing business.
   Consumer and middle-market banking operations performed
better than the company's corporate banking business.
Operating profit at the consumer and middle-market banking
businesses was $61 million, up 39% from a year earlier. The
corporate banking unit's profit nosedived 74%, however, to
$20 million.
   In the second quarter, First Chicago's provision for loan
losses was $85 million, down from an especially high
provision of $160 million in the first quarter, when some
real estate problems popped up. The company charged off $280
million of loans during the quarter, most of it in loans to
less developed countries for which reserves were already
taken, compared with $374 million in the first quarter.
   Total nonperforming loans were $871 million June 30, down
from $1.05 billion March 31. Combined nonperforming real
estate loans and real estate owned through foreclosure and
other means remained high, however, at $624 million compared
with $592 million March 31.
                                                                                                       

   Bank of New York
                                                                                                       

   A $94 million addition to reserves for possible loan
losses resulted in the earnings drop. Of that amount, $71
million was charged for bad domestic loans, and the remaining
$23 million was used to boost the reserve level to $940
million, or 2.62% of loans.
   Nonperforming assets climbed 12% to $1.33 billion,
including an increase of $160 million in real estate loans
and $117 million of highly leveraged corporate loans. As of
June 30, non-performing assets stood at 3.7% of loans, up
slightly from 3.4% March 31.
   Net interest income, before the loan-loss provision, rose
7% to $346 million, while non-interest income gained to $243
million from $237 million.
                                                                                                       

   Midlantic Corp.
                                                                                                       

   A $186 million addition to its reserve for possible losses
on real estate and other commercial loans resulted in the
loss for the quarter at the Edison, N.J., company. The
provision was partly offset by a $68 million gain from the
sale of Midlantic's credit card accounts and receivables to
Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Past-due loans and foreclosures in the quarter climbed 29%
to $923 million from $715 million March 31. Net charge-offs
rose 60% to $77 million.
   As of June 30, Midlantic's reserve for losses stood at
$550 million, or 76% of its past-due loans.
   Despite its loan troubles, Chairman Robert Van Buren said
Midlantic's capital levels exceed regulatory minimums by
comfortable margins. At June 30, the company's ratio of
equity to assets was 6.4%, down from 6.9% a year earlier.
   For the quarter, net interest income dropped to $223
million, compared with $226 million a year earlier, and the
net interest margin shrank to 4.06% from 4.61% in the first
quarter. The tighter margin reflected the higher deposit
rates being paid by the company's banks to bolster liquidity
as well as the higher levels of nonperforming assets.
