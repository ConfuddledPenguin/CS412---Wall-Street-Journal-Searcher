   Sometimes it takes a little fertilizer to make the grass
roots grow.
   Fighting a bill by Sen. John Danforth to break up cable-TV
monopolies, American Cablevision Co. wanted the senator and
other lawmakers to know that it isn't just the cable industry
that is opposed to the proposed regulation. And the Kansas
City company figured it didn't have to look far to find
private citizens who would want to send that message to
Washington. Grassroots support could be cultivated right
there in the office.

   In a memo circulated to its employees, the company urged
them to write letters of protest to Sen. Danforth and other
lawmakers -- as private citizens. "Use plain stationery and
your home address," the memo said. "We don't want this to
look like an organized effort." Letter writers were told they
could identify themselves as employees of the company, "but
Congress has already heard all our good arguments from the
industry's point of view."
   The memo offered a little incentive for people to raise a
ruckus. Their reward, as promised in the memo from the public
relations department: "an attractive gray Comedy Channel
T-shirt (Offer limited to the first 100 employees who
write)."
   For those who could persuade others to write, there was
more: "Copies of a letter from your aunt in Marshall or your
neighbor or anyone else are worth a mug."
   Why a T-shirt prize? "We had T-shirts coming out our
ears," says Carol Rothwell, the company's public relations
director. "We are always giving away T-shirts -- that's part
of our internal culture."
   In case correspondents couldn't think of anything to say,
the memo offered suggestions. Write "that you don't see any
need for government intervention in a private entertainment
business." Or: "I wonder why Congress is spending so much
time on cable when I have more serious concerns such as
-------." The company even provided stamps.
   Ms. Rothwell defends the campaign as a time-honored
American tradition. "Every industry does grass-roots
politics," she says. "It's been around as long as we've had a
Congress."
   American Cablevision declines to estimate the number of
letters generated by the campaign, but Steve Hilton, a press
spokesman for Sen. Danforth, says they haven't exactly been
pouring in. He puts the total at about 20. "I don't think the
postal service has been overly taxed," says Mr. Hilton.
