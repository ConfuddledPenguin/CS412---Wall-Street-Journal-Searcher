   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union dropped its objections to a
united Germany being a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The decision, announced by President Mikhail Gorbachev
after two days of talks with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, removes the last major hurdle to German unity. Mr.
Gorbachev told a news conference that it was the right of a
sovereign Germany to choose which military alliance it
belonged to.

   "Whether we like it or not the time will come when a
united Germany will be in NATO if that is its choice," Mr.
Gorbachev said. "Then, if that is the choice, to some degree
and in some form it can work together with the Soviet Union."
   President Bush, in a statement released by the White
House, hailed Gorbachev's remark, saying: "This comment
demonstrates statesmanship, and strengthens efforts to build
enduring relationships based on cooperation."
   In return for Mr. Gorbachev's concession, Mr. Kohl pledged
that a united Germany will reduce the size of its army about
40% to 370,000 men and negotiate a treaty with the Soviets on
troop withdrawals. The Soviets would be given three to four
years to withdraw their 380,000 troops from East German
territory, during which time no non-German NATO troops would
be based in East Germany. A united Germany also would
renounce chemical weapons and join the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
   The two sides agreed to work on a second treaty on
economic, political and broader elements of the bilateral
relationship, to replace separate existing Soviet treaties
with East and West Germany.
   The two leaders also discussed how West German economic
aid could help save the Soviet economy. A reunited Germany
will be the Soviet Union's biggest trading partner by a wide
margin.
   In their televised news conference, Mr. Gorbachev said the
agreement was a compromise. "Politics is the art of the
possible," he said. "In absolute terms, the West German side
didn't get what it was counting on. In absolute terms, we in
our turn did not get what we had been counting on. But we
were realists."
   After months of resisting the idea of a united Germany in
NATO, the Soviet Union finally bowed to the inevitable.
Western nations all insist that a united Germany be anchored
in the Western alliance -- a position Mr. Kohl strongly
supports.
   Mr. Gorbachev's change of heart was helped by several
factors. He has just weathered a crucial Soviet Communist
Party Congress, in which he stifled harsh criticism of his
foreign policy and emerged with broad endorsement for
continuing his policies. He also removed some of the toughest
hard-liners who opposed German unity from the leadership,
putting the party on a more moderate course.
   Mr. Kohl sweetened the pill by agreeing to set a ceiling
on future German troop strength, before final figures are
determined at conventional arms reduction talks now taking
place in Vienna.
   Soviet television showed scenes of the meetings at the
southern Russian spa town of Mineralnye Vody. It was the
first time Mr. Gorbachev had invited a Western leader to
talks outside of Moscow and he appeared very relaxed. In an
open-necked shirt and sweater, Mr. Gorbachev was shown
walking through the woods, laughing and joking with Mr. Kohl.
   TV pictures helped promote the image of a newly friendly
partnership. Most striking were the numerous Soviet veterans
of World War II waving tiny West German flags and welcoming
Mr. Kohl.
   This depiction is an abrupt turnaround for state-run
television. For decades, war movies have been popular fare in
the Soviet Union and the German threat has been a staple of
Soviet propaganda. At least 20 million Soviets died in World
War II.
   Now, Mr. Gorbachev must shift public attention from that
bitter history to the generations of cooperation that have
also been part of the two countries' relations. A central
factor in the new relationship will be a united Germany's
ability to help Mr. Gorbachev's attempts to turn the Soviet
Union into a market-based economy.
   A senior West German official said before the meeting that
Mr. Kohl would assure Mr. Gorbachev that Bonn plans to be his
economic partner, active in providing credits and technical
know-how. West Germany has already given $3 billion in
credits to the Soviet Union.
   The official said a new aid package would include
assistance in establishing a transport system and management
training, two areas that Soviet economists and foreign
businessmen say are essential before any economic reform can
get off the ground. West Germany also would buy more oil and
natural gas from the Soviets, the proceeds from which Moscow
could use to finance the expanded relationship.
   Economists in the Soviet Union have long been split into
two camps -- those who see the U.S. as their best potential
partner and those who believe the rosiest future lies in
close ties with a united Germany. Since Mr. Kohl visited
Moscow in 1988, West Germany has increasingly been viewed as
a good model.
   East Germany is already the Soviet Union's biggest trading
partner in the East Bloc, as West Germany is in the West.
Each one accounts for about 10% of the Soviet Union's total
trade.
