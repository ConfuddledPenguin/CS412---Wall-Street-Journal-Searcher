   Magazine publishers, known for their boundless optimism,
insisted the slump that hit most titles in the first quarter
was an aberration. Sure, things were tough, they said, but
slow first quarters are part of the business.
   Well, the first-half numbers from Publishers Information
Bureau, which tracks both large and small consumer magazines,
will be released today. Publishers will have to think up a
new excuse this time.

   Advertising pages dropped 4% in June and 3.3% for the
first six months, compared with the year earlier periods, the
PIB figures show. And the numbers show something more
disturbing: The falloff in important ad categories such as
automotive and cigarette and tobacco has accelerated from the
first quarter.
   Automotive, the largest category at $415 million, went
from being down 7.4% in the first quarter to being down 12.5%
in the first half; cigarette's deficit grew from 25% to 27%
in the same period.
   As a scoreboard for the industry, the numbers paint a
bleak picture, with almost no indication of a rebound.
National advertisers have already made their media placements
through September, says Nancy W. Smith, director of media
services at Young &amp; Rubicam. "I wish I weren't seeing this,"
she says. "I don't see anything in the cards that will change
things."
   The slump stems from a general economic slowdown, but has
been exacerbated by the straits of major magazine advertisers
such as retailers and car companies. In a double hit, ad
dollars are also being snapped up by competitive media. "Most
ad budgets are flat this year," says Michael Drexler,
executive vice president at Bozell. "But if they are up, the
increases are going to TV rate increases or to cable TV,
which continues to absorb a greater part of the ad revenue
pie."
   Magazines have weathered down cycles before. But now the
concern is no longer focused on when the good times will
return, but rather just how many magazines will be left
standing when they do.
   In this slump, the magazines most likely to fold will be
those that have artificially inflated their circulations with
discounts and giveaways. "If you are giving away circulation,
you will be a victim of a very bad economic climate," says
Mr. Drexler. "And if you are second or third in your
category, it's going to get tougher." Among the magazines
that use discounts the most are women's service books along
with second-tier women's fashion and sports magazines.
   But the industry's mass-circulation heavyweights are
reeling, too, although many had expected a rebound by now. A
number of publishers that had predicted moderate gains in
1990 are now saying they will consider it a victory if their
ad pages are flat this year.
   Some of the hardest-hit books include the major weeklies.
Time Warner's People was down 10% and Time was down 8% for
the first half. Other weeklies that saw big declines were
McGraw-Hill's Business Week, down 8.5%; News Corp.'s TV
Guide, down 10%; and Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek, down 9%.
   There were some notable success stories in the face of an
otherwise miserable first half. Conde Nast's HG (formerly
House and Garden) is up 20%, after recovering from a
near-disastrous name change, and Vanity Fair is up 3%, not
bad for a general interest magazine. Conde Nast is a unit of
Advance Publications. Forbes magazine logged an 8.2% increase
in the business magazine field, one of the most competitive
in the industry.
   Some advertiser groups showed signs of life, too.
Advertising revenue for travel, hotels and resorts increased
4% for the first half, toiletries and cosmetics ad revenue
grew 6%, and the food products category increased 11%.
   But those bright spots were few and far between, and not
many publishing executives disagree that a magazine shakeout
is in full effect. The list of dead magazines is growing, and
spans those with city or regional circulation and those with
national readership.
   The most recent casualties are Weider Health &amp; Fitness
Corp.'s Moxie, a national magazine for older women, and
Pennington Publishing Inc.'s Cook's, an upscale epicurean
magazine. Their demise follows that of several regional
titles, such as Metrocorp's Manhattan, inc., CMP
Publications' Long Island Monthly, Stern Publications' 7
Days, and Time Warner's Southpoint.
   "The recession in advertising and media hit first on local
media, then spread to national," says John Suhler, president
of Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, a media brokerage firm in
New York. "Advertisers have reacted for two years" and will
for two years to come, he says.
   The question now is which "franchise" magazines --
established, revenue-churning titles -- will feel the heat.
Because of parent Hachette S.A.'s debt problems, for example,
Diamandis Communications Inc. has been forced to put its
Woman's Day on the block.
   Industry optimists point to statistics compiled by Samir
Husni, a University of Mississippi professor, showing that
new magazines are sprouting everywhere: 584 new ones in 1989
compared with 231 in 1985. But most of those are
small-circulation, narrow-interest magazines -- the type that
often are the least likely to weather tough times -- such as
The Turkey Hunter, Victorian Decorating, and Nude &amp; Natural
(for nudists, naturally).
   In any case, Mr. Husni's numbers don't show how the ad
downswing is curtailing start-up activity by major
publishers. Business Week is going ahead with its launch of
Assets magazine, but Goldhirsh Group's Inc. magazine has
already folded its spinoff, The Inc. Life, after only one
issue in May. The Inc. Life was a quarterly lifestyle
magazine for the business executive.
   Some publishers are holding out hope that new car
introductions will pump auto dollars into major magazines.
This fall, General Motors Corp. is expected to launch a media
blitz to sell cars coming off the assembly line of its new
Saturn subsidiary.
   "Saturn is going to spend a fair amount in Newsweek," says
Peter Eldredge, publisher of Newsweek. "We've been told to
feel good about Saturn. But in this sort of climate, we
aren't taking anything for granted."

   CUTBACK: Reader's Digest Association Inc. said it will
pare about 25 of its 100 ad-sales positions and create
several others. The Pleasantville, N.Y., publisher also said
it is seeking a new director of ad sales. The cuts are mostly
in support staff, the company said. Reader's Digest also
named Richard D. Wright associate publisher for sales
development, a new position. He was national sales manager.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Geer, DuBois Inc. promoted three executives,
Joseph Bruce, Michael Garcia and Joy Sliwa, to executive vice
president.
