   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, unable to cajole
Democrats in Congress into a deficit-reduction accord, tried
to scare them.
   If no agreement is reached at the budget summit talks,
across-the-board spending cuts of about $100 billion will be
triggered this fall, Budget Director Richard Darman said.

   Cuts of this "totally unprecedented size" would cripple
federal government's operations, Mr. Darman said. Although
the law exempts two-thirds of all spending, the other
one-third would be hit hard. Up to one million military
personnel could be let go. A million children could go
without vaccination. More than 100 air-traffic control towers
could be shut or their hours curtailed. The House Budget
Committee estimates that nearly 40% of all government
personnel outside the Pentagon could be laid off.
   The administration increased its estimate of the fiscal
1991 deficit an additional $10 billion from the figure it
gave budget negotiators last month. It now projects the
deficit at $168.8 billion -- not counting
greater-than-expected spending on the savings-and-loan
bailout. The target set by the Gramm-Rudman law is $64
billion.
   In January, the administration said the deficit would hit
$100.5 billion if Congress didn't act. By the time the
president convened the budget talks in May, the estimate had
been increased to between $138 billion and $148 billion. And
last month, Mr. Darman said the estimate had crept up to $159
billion. The increases reflect not only a slower economy and
higher interest rates, but substantially lower tax receipts
and greater spending than would have been anticipated given
the economy's current condition.
   When the administration's best guess of spending on the
thrift bailout is included, the deficit is now forecast to
hit $231.4 billion. The new White House numbers are within a
few billion dollars of the Congressional Budget Office's
estimates.
   Both Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
insisted the administration won't agree to waive the spending
cuts unless the budget summit talks produce a broader
deficit-reduction compromise. House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) said he, too, would oppose such a
move. "That would be the biggest cop-out of all."
   But Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D.,
Tenn.) said it is "almost impossible for me to believe" that
the cuts would be left in place for an entire year.
   Mr. Darman sought to use new deficit projections for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 to push Congress toward
agreement. "The pressure is put on. It is inescapable," he
said. To heighten the pressure, Mr. Darman also released
details on the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, even
though the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law doesn't require
that report until Aug. 25.
   President Bush issued a statement saying the prospect of
such drastic cuts made it "all the more important that the
budget summit reach agreement promptly and Congress act
responsibly to bring the deficit down."
   The new administration report comes at a moment when the
budget talks appear to be stalled. The full negotiating teams
haven't met since Wednesday, although they may meet again
today. Administration officials met privately over the
weekend with key members of Congress and their staffs to talk
about, among other things, what taxes to increase.
   Staffers from the Treasury, House Ways and Means Committee
and Senate Finance Committee winnowed down a long array of
tax increases and tax breaks to what one House staff member
characterized as "a more manageable list." The aide said the
list, which was being prepared by the Treasury, would be used
by negotiators in deciding on a tax package. Another staffer
characterized the weekend discussions as "spade work." Among
the items on the list, described as "all-inclusive" by one
participant, are changes in income-tax rates and excise
taxes, and closing loopholes.
   Rep. Panetta said Democratic negotiators may be briefed on
those discussions as early as today. An underlying split
among Democrats was obvious as they responded to the new
administration estimates. Rep. Panetta spoke hopefully about
coming to an agreement in the next few weeks. Sen. Sasser
said that would be "exceedingly difficult." He complained
that "progress has been at a snail's pace" and blamed
President Bush for not talking more in public about the
severity of the deficit.
   Echoing Mr. Darman, Rep. Panetta said he hoped the new
figures would make Congress and the public appreciate the
magnitude of the deficit problem. "The bill for the '80s is
now coming due," he said. "These new numbers should hit the
White House, the Congress and the summit like a fire alarm in
the night."
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) told
reporters: "I'm glad the administration has acknowledged the
inaccuracy of their earlier estimates."
   Separately, Republican staffers say one matter likely to
be raised, either at a regular weekly meeting of Republican
leaders with the president or at a planned caucus of
Republican budget negotiators later in the day, is the uneasy
feeling among some Republicans that Mr. Darman may be
negotiating behind their backs with key Democrats.
   Mr. Brady dismissed demands from some Republicans that the
summit eschew all tax increases. "This is not a political
wrestling match," he said. "This is important to the American
people."
   Administration officials used the release of the figures
to underscore again their concern that the Federal Reserve
might not push interest rates down sufficiently to offset a
deficit-reduction accord. Mr. Brady stressed the importance
of "coordinated fiscal and monetary action." Michael Boskin,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the Fed
should move "not only substantially, but quickly." The move
would have to be "a substantial multiple" of the
quarter-point reduction in short-term interest rates that the
Fed implemented last week.
   In a footnote to the new forecasts, the administration
said that what it termed "a normal recession" would add $33.7
billion to the federal deficit in fiscal 1991.
   It also disclosed that the deficit for the current year
now is projected at $161.3 billion if spending on the thrift
bailout is excluded and $218.5 billion if it's included. The
Gramm-Rudman law's deficit target for fiscal 1990 was $100
billion, but the law's deadline for imposing across-the-board
cuts for this year has already passed.
