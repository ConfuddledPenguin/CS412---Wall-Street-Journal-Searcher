   ALTHOUGH LIGHT and electricity travel at about the same
basic speed, voice and data messages can be transmitted much
faster through light than through electricity in copper
wires. The reason is the much greater bandwidth of light,
which permits far greater capacity. In last Tuesday's
edition, the comparison of speeds was oversimplified.

   CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS being issued on the American Stock
Exchange in connection with Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of
a majority stake in Rorer Group Inc. are scheduled for August
distribution. Their maximum value at July 31, 1994, if Rorer
extends them one year, would be $54.12 each. Yesterday's
edition incorrectly stated the distribution date and maximum
value.
