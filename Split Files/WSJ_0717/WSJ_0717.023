   The suburban yard slave is ruled by four interlocking
principalities: sprinkler system, lawn, wife, lawn mower. The
oppressive cycle is quite well known: Sprinkler waters lawn,
lawn grows and distresses wife, wife sends slave out to run
lawn mower over lawn, peace returns to household.
   This process is repeated once a week, usually on
Saturdays, though some slaves also mow Wednesday evenings,
keeping the yard trim while the wife sits inside, packing
herself with carbohydrates. It was to protect this way of
life that Patton whipped the Wehrmacht and Truman nuked
Japan.

   Some are happily enslaved, but for those who desire their
freedom, two new books may be of help. Paul Dempsey's "How to
Repair Tecumseh Engines" (TAB Books, Blue Ridge Summit, Pa.;
295 pages; $24.95 hardcover, $14.95 paperback) can help you
neutralize your lawn mower, while Richard L. Austin's "Lawn
Sprinklers: A Do-It-Yourself Guide" (TAB; 147 pages; $19.95
hardcover, $12.95 paperback) is an excellent book on how to
launch an attack on your watering system. Both include
indexes and detailed illustrations.
   The authors, to be sure, have not set out to free the lawn
lackey. To the contrary, their purpose is to keep his
manacles in good working order. No matter. If you know how to
fix a lawn mower, you also know how to sabotage it. Let us
begin with the Tecumseh engine.
   Mr. Dempsey, it must be said, is a fan of the Tecumseh,
reveling in the minutiae of these popular one-cycle,
air-cooled engines whose displacement runs from two to nearly
30 inches. He does admit to some slighting of outboard
powerheads due to space limitations, but this cannot be held
against him.
   Yet at one point, however, he goes a little far, opining
that "These engines are also used on many Toro lawn mowers,
which are generally considered to be the finest mowers built
in the United States." As the owner of a Lawn Boy, I take
some offense at this assertion; perhaps the author should
consider dropping this insensitive boasting from subsequent
printings.
   But all hostility fades as the book unlocks the secrets of
these doomsday machines, from their ignition systems to their
carburetors to the especially complex "DC system with diode
in harness." By merely reversing the repair directions, the
slave can render the most ferocious of these machines
impotent. One carefully planned slip of the screwdriver and
life is regained.
   Depending on the IQ of the wife, a slave sometimes can get
away with only a slight adjustment. Mr. Dempsey's
troubleshooting chart, for instance, points out that engines
will not start if the gas tank is empty. This is an old
trick, but certainly worth a try. A closed fuel shutoff
valve, the author points out, also can cause trouble. Try
closing it and see if she catches on. Then there's the
mechanical version of cardiac arrest -- poor compression --
which requires that the owner "overhaul engine." In this
case, you might as well call the lawn service and dust off
those golf clubs. That dang lawn mower is as good as dead.
   An attack on the sprinkler system, on the other hand, will
make tinkering with the lawn mower unnecessary, at least if
you live in a place where rain is scarce. Here in Denver, for
instance, a few weeks without water and your yard looks like
a big piece of burnt toast.
   There are plenty of ways to sabotage a sprinkler system,
all of which can be done on the sly. Control and circuit
valves are easy targets, but watch out for that back flow
unit. Mess that up and you've got debris and lawn chemicals
in your water system, and that stuff tastes just awful.
   Again, depending on the IQ of the wife, the slave has
several options in his quest to monkey wrench the lawn, all
of them detailed in Mr. Austin's masterwork. Perhaps the
easiest is to do a little surgery on the brains of the system
-- the timer box, an electrically powered device that
controls when the sprinklers turn on and off. One strategy:
Don't set the timers at all. If that's too obvious, set the
sprinkling time for about five minutes, which is not enough
to keep the patient alive. On the other hand, if the wife is
really dumb, just unplug the sucker]
   Forgetting to pay the water bill also will do the trick.
   So what do you do for fun once your lawn dries up? Plenty.
Here in the semi-arid regions, those of us with dogs can
spend some of that time ridding the property of the canine
version of buffalo chips, which dry golf-ball hard in the
burning Western sun.
   The procedure is simple: Enter the yard before the
neighbors awake, take 9-iron, chip offending matter into
neighbors' yard. If caught, explain that your dead yard no
longer needs the fertilizer. Chances are, your neighbors will
appreciate your consideration.
