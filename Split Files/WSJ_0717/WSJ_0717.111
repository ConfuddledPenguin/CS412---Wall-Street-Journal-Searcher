   ISS International Service System Inc.'s directors accepted
a $12-a-share bid from ISS International Service System AS,
Copenhagen.
   ISS AS seeks to acquire the remaining 1.3 million shares,
or 36%, it doesn't already own of the New York-based
building-maintenance services company. An ISS International
Service System official said that the company hopes to have a
special stockholder meeting in September to act on the merger
agreement.

   In June a special committee of the ISS board rejected the
original offer made by ISS AS to acquire the shares at $10
each.
   In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, ISS International shares closed at $11.625, up 25
cents.
