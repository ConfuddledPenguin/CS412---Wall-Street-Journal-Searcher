   In a statement, the companies said Samsung will act as
exclusive Korean marketer for Sequoia, a maker of
fault-tolerant computers based on the Unix software operating
system. The companies also said they will jointly develop a
low-end computer based on Sequoia's patented multiprocessor
computer design. It should be ready in the 1991 first
quarter, the statement said.
