   CHICAGO -- Dean Foods Co. expects to report per-share
earnings for its fourth quarter, ended May 31, of about 75
cents to 80 cents a share, its chairman and chief executive
officer, Howard M. Dean, said.
   While that represents a decline of about 5% to 10% from a
year earlier, the executive said in an interview that he was
pleased with the results, "because it's been a tough year for
us."

   Despite the lower per-share earnings, he said, operating
earnings rose 19% to 27% for the quarter.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the food and dairy concern
earned $22.2 million, or 84 cents a share, helped by a $5.4
million, or 21 cent-a-share, gain from the sale of its
Baskin-Robbins ice cream business.
   Sales for the latest quarter were up from $437.6 million a
year earlier, Mr. Dean said, but he wouldn't be specific.
   Mr. Dean said the company's specialty food products
operation is having a good year, but he credited most of the
quarter's upturn in operating earnings to "improved dairy
earnings and acquisitions."
   He said the three acquisitions the company made over the
past year, of Cates Pickle Co., Bellingham Frozen Foods and
Mayfield Dairy Farms, all helped boost operating earnings in
the fourth quarter.
   For fiscal 1990, Mr. Dean expects the company to earn
between $2.25 and $2.30 a share, with sales "just short of $2
billion." This compares with earnings in fiscal 1989 of $60.4
million, or $2.28 a share, on sales of $1.68 billion.
   Mr. Dean said the company's directors will be considering
increasing the quarterly dividend on its common at their
meeting next week. Dean Foods currently pays 16.5 cents a
share quarterly.
