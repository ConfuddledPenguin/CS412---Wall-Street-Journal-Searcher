   CINCINNATI -- Jacor Communications Inc. said it reached a
new agreement with its banks on refinancing debts, which will
allow it to defer indefinitely certain payments on
subordinated debt, warrants or capital stock.
   The action includes deferring a July 16 dividend payment
on the company's 7% cumulative preferred stock.

   Jacor said its banks have extended until Aug. 20 the
interest payment dates on substantially all advances. The
banks also extended to the same date their requirement that
Jacor raise $15 million in equity.
   Jacor, which owns radio stations and a cable television
system, said it has hired Salomon Brothers Inc. to help
refinance its debts.
