   Lafarge Coppee S.A. said it will take full control of VEB
Karsdorf of East Germany, in a move that will make the French
cement and building materials concern Europe's leading cement
producer.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed, but Lafarge Coppee
Chairman Bertrand Collomb said it was less than the
investment of between one billion and two billion francs
($180.7 million and $361.3 million) that will be required to
modernize the East German cement company's installations and
bring them up to Western productivity standards in the coming
years.

   Lafarge Coppee signed a preliminary agreement for the
Karsdorf takeover in June. Karsdorf's assets are still being
audited, and completing all financial details could take
until year end, Mr. Collomb said, noting that Lafarge Coppee
has already injected 50 million marks ($30.3 million) into
Karsdorf in the form of working capital. The acquisition will
be carried out through Lafarge Coppee's West German unit,
Wossinger Zement G.m.b.H.
