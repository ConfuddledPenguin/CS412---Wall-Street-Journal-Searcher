   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc. said it
received a contract it valued at about $25 million from Ford
Aerospace Corp. to produce more than 200 laser subsystems for
McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s F/A-18 attack fighter jet.
   The subsystems are part of the jets' target systems, made
by Ford Aerospace, a unit of Ford Motor Co. The Litton
contract includes options for more than 300 additional
subsystems. Litton, a technology concern, said the subsystems
would be made at the company's Laser Systems division in
Apopka, Fla.
