   TORONTO -- Bond International Gold Inc., a unit of LAC
Minerals Ltd., a gold mining concern, said it has a
commitment from a syndicate of banks led by N.M. Rothschild &amp;
Sons Ltd. for a 420,000-ounce gold loan, to be repaid in
quarterly payments beginning next January and maturing in
July 1995.
   Bond said the loan is subject to completion of
documentation, which is expected later this month, and is
guaranteed by LAC. It said that the new facility replaces
gold loans totaling about 470,000 ounces, and that the
difference of 50,000 ounces will be repaid from cash
reserves.
