   The board of New Century Communications Inc., New
York-based parent of trade-magazine publisher Edgell
Communications Inc., approved in principle a plan to
restructure its $290 million of debt and $57 million of
preferred stock.
   New Century was formed through a December 1987 leveraged
buy-out of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s
business-publishing, trade-show production and
school-supplies distribution businesses. The buy-out was
executed by General Electric Co.'s investment-bank
subsidiary, Kidder, Peabody & Co.; members of Edgell's senior
management; and others.

   "Our objective is to be able to dedicate more operating
income to the company," a spokeswoman for New Century said.
The restructuring would cut and defer payments of interest
and principal.
   Advertising remains soft, but New Century's two other
divisions are performing well, the spokeswoman said. The
restructuring is subject to negotiations with lenders and
investors.
   New Century said its senior lenders -- which include GE's
financial-services arm, General Electric Capital Corp., and
seven banks -- have blocked it from making a $7 million
semiannual interest payment, due yesterday on its 14% senior
subordinated debentures, for as long as 120 days.
