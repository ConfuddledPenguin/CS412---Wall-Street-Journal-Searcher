   Domestic production by the top two Japanese auto makers
was also higher, but exports were notably lower, reflecting
the trend toward overseas production.
   Exports from January to June by top market-share holder
Toyota were 851,886 units, down 6.6% from a year earlier.
Nissan's exports plummeted 17% to 461,124 units.
   In June alone, domestic sales by Toyota rose 5.2% to
224,875 units, the 15th consecutive month of gains and a new
high for the month. Nissan's domestic sales in June rose 5.3%
to 125,670 units.
   Exports in June by Toyota were up 11%, the first
year-on-year gain in three months, but Nissan's exports
slumped 9.1% in the month.
