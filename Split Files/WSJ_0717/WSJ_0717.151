   I enjoyed Michael Gartner's letter to Dr. Louis Sullivan
(Viewpoint, June 7). However, a small correction is in order.
Mr. Gartner states, ". . . the constant campaign against
smoking waged first by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. . .
."
   Of course, the "constant campaign against smoking" was
waged first by my father, Dr. Luther L. Terry. His
courageous, ground-breaking report in 1964 when he was
surgeon general represented the first salvo against the
largest preventable cause of death and disability in our
nation. Dr. Koop himself has on numerous occasions cited
Dad's work as providing the scientific and moral foundation
for the 26 years of efforts that have followed.

   To quote from Joseph A. Califano's eulogy at my father's
funeral:
   "Luther Terry saved as many lives as any Salk or Pasteur
or Madame Curie. He is as much a medical giant. But he is
more. No powerful economic forces rose up to defend polio, or
smallpox or unsafe milk. When Luther Terry told us of the
dangers of smoking, political and financial powers of magnum
force rose to attack him. His discovery was one they had
tried to hide, one they didn't want to talk about. But Luther
spoke out. Softly, but firmly he stood his ground. He
persevered, and in the end he revolutionized our thinking
about the causes of modern-day diseases. Many of us have
walked and will walk in his footsteps, but none of us can
fill his shoes. . . ."
   The Terry family is gratified with the work of those who
followed Dad, particularly Dr. Koop, whose dedication and
unquestioned integrity in the latest assault on smoking are
familiar echoes. But I ask you to remember the man who
started it all, a brave, self-effacing hero, Luther Terry.
