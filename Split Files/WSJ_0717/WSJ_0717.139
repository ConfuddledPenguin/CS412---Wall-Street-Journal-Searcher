   WASHINGTON -- A Pittsburgh laboratory performed faulty
tests on at least 11 generic-drug products prior to their
approval, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
   An FDA review of tests performed by Biodecision
Laboratories on 13 generic-drug products made by other
companies found that 11 were of questionable validity. Among
the problems cited were insufficient documentation and
inadequate training of laboratory personnel. The test results
had been submitted to the FDA as part of the drug-approval
process.

   Robert Lesher, Biodecision president, said the lab had
already reviewed 12 of the 13 tests cited by the FDA and
found that "in every case, the original conclusion remains
intact." The FDA plans to examine the drugs before
determining whether they should remain on the market, a
spokesman said.
   Although Mr. Lesher wouldn't disclose the companies or
drugs involved for reasons of confidentiality, he said that
since the company's founding in 1971, "we've done work for
every major generic drug company." The FDA evaluation
reviewed tests performed by the lab since that time.
