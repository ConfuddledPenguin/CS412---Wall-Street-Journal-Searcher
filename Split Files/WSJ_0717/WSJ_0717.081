   Du Pont Co. and HEM Research Inc. agreed to settle
litigation stemming from the collapse of their joint venture
with an experimental AIDS drug.
   Under the agreement, Du Pont will pay HEM $2.8 million,
give up the 5% stake in HEM that it acquired in 1987 and
relinquish certain marketing and royalty rights to the drug,
called Ampligen.

   The agreement, announced yesterday by HEM, brings to an
end the lawsuits that ensued after the close of a big
clinical trial meant to determine whether Ampligen slowed the
progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
patients infected with the AIDS virus.
   Du Pont, the Wilmington, Del., chemicals giant, had
quickly allied itself with HEM after HEM researchers reported
in the British medical journal Lancet encouraging but
inconclusive results from a small trial of Ampligen. Du Pont
has since said in court papers that it invested more than $30
million in HEM and its work with Ampligen, including the
large trial, which involved more than 300 patients.
   But after Ampligen failed to show efficacy in the large
trial, Du Pont alleged that it had been provided misleading
information by HEM, a closely held company based in
Philadelphia. Du Pont said the damages sought in its suit,
filed in a Delaware state court, far exceeded HEM's net worth
of $8.5 million at the end of 1988.
   HEM, for its part, has contended that the plastic bags Du
Pont used to package Ampligen, which is given intravenously,
impaired the drug's potency. During the initial trial
reported in the Lancet, the drug was packaged in glass
bottles.
   HEM countersued Du Pont, seeking $7.4 million it said it
was owed by Du Pont, plus other damages under
breach-of-contract claims. Those claims, as well as Du
Pont's, were dropped under the pact.
   E. Paul Charlap, HEM's chairman and chief executive
officer, called the settlement a "favorable outcome" for HEM.
A Du Pont spokesman replied that "both sides had claims and
counterclaims, and we came to this agreement."
   Even as the settlement was reached, though, another point
of contention between HEM and Du Pont arose. Although Du Pont
is to give its unused vials of Ampligen to HEM under the
accord, Du Pont destroyed raw material used to make the drug,
an anti-viral agent fashioned from double-stranded
ribonucleic acid.
   HEM officials estimated that the raw material could have
been used to make enough Ampligen to treat some 3,000
patients for a year. "Obviously, this is going to cause this
little company a lot of trouble" in expanding future trials,
said William M. Mitchell, a consultant to HEM and a pathology
professor at Vanderbilt University, adding that HEM had
thought it might gain possession of the material.
   The Du Pont spokesman said, "We had asked" HEM about the
raw material during settlement talks, "and they had no
interest. We had no use for it, so we destroyed it."
   About 30 people infected with the AIDS virus continue to
be treated with Ampligen from glass bottles under HEM's
auspices. In addition, HEM said, it recently expanded its
U.S. clinical trials in the use of Ampligen against a
virus-caused blindness related to AIDS and is seeking
clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to broaden
its trials in AIDS-related disorders.
