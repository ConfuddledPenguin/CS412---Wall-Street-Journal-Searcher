   John R. Nelson, Philip Morris's vice president for
corporate affairs, presented the cigarette industry's
standard reply to assertions by critics that the industry
targets children for tobacco-product sales (Letters, June
12). It is heartening to see that Mr. Nelson agrees with
public-health authorities on several substantial matters. We
believe, however, that Philip Morris should back up its
policy with action.
   The areas of agreement are these: Children should not
smoke, and it is a good thing tobacco-product sales to people
below age 18 are generally against the law.

   Mr. Nelson goes even further when he says, "We at Philip
Morris do not want minors to smoke."
   Since Philip Morris does not want minors to smoke, its
sales to minors are unwanted, and its profits on sales to
minors are also unwanted. At a minimum, then, Philip Morris's
resolve to prevent children from using its tobacco products
should be measured by how it uses its unwanted profits from
sales to kids.
   How much is this? Mr. Nelson indicates that "A small
number of {the company's} cigarettes are unfortunately
obtained by minors."
   Given the enormous size of his company's cigarette sales,
Mr. Nelson can be forgiven the characterization of its sales
to underage people as "small." These only amounted to 1.5% of
cigarettes sold in the U.S. last year. Still, that's a
substantial number of smokes.
   We estimate that last year, 750 packs of Marlboros were
consumed by kids younger than 18 every minute, and Philip
Morris made a profit of $130 million for the year from these
largely illicit sales to the underage. While these numbers
are small compared with overall corporate performance, they
are substantially larger than the company's efforts to
prevent smoking by children.
   We invite Philip Morris to back up its policy: As a
minimum, the company should give its profits on mostly
illegal sales to the underage to state health departments
across the country to support programs for the prevention of
nicotine addiction among the young. Anything less has to be
regarded as window dressing.
