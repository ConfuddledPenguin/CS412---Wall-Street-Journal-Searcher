   Along with daily doses of reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic,
children in many public schools around the country are
getting powerful lessons on a more controversial subject:
brand loyalty.
   As never before, some of the nation's best-known
marketers, including Coca-Cola Co., International Business
Machines Corp. and Reebok International Ltd., are devising
ways to slip advertising messages into the nation's schools.
The pace has escalated as officials in financially strapped
school districts look to the business community for support.
Many consumer-products companies are happy to oblige -- with
a few strings attached.

   The best-known classroom pitchman remains Christopher
Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications L.P. His launch
in March of a closed-circuit television network that includes
two minutes of ads on a daily news program for students
touched off a barrage of criticism. Yet the controversy has
hardly dissuaded other companies from launching their own
educational marketing programs.
   This fall, Donnelley Marketing, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp., will enlist an army of home economics, health and gym
teachers to hand out product samples and coupons to 2.4
million junior high and high school students. Scholastic
Inc., among the nation's largest publisher of books and
magazines for children, will crank out single-sponsor
magazines and other teaching tools for some 40 companies,
including such heavyweights as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. and Mars Inc.'s M&amp;M/Mars division.
   Cover Concepts Marketing Services Inc. will send one
million high school students textbook covers that promote
such brands as Nike Inc. shoes and Mars's Milky Way candy
bars. School Properties USA Inc. will help 15 state school
associations sign up corporate sponsors, including Reebok,
for high school sports events.
   Marketers are so interested in the classroom because the
kids' market is so big: Teen-agers alone buy an estimated $78
billion in goods each year -- and they cajole their parents
into spending up to twice that amount. Moreover, while TV
viewers at home often zap to another channel at commercial
breaks, kids in the classroom are a captive audience to whom
ads may seem a welcome break from studies. And because school
marketing is relatively untried, there's little clutter to
cut through.
   "The kids we're reaching are consumers in training," says
Joseph Fenton, director of cooperative marketing at
Donnelley. "You want to reach consumers at their most
formative point."
   Others are far less enthusiastic about the trend. Today,
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, is
releasing a study that decries the "nonstop advertising
barrage on America's children." The report documents five
major categories, including classroom ads, in which the
number of commercial messages is growing at "an alarming
rate."
   Some of the nation's school administrators are doing heavy
soul-searching. On the one hand, harried teachers have been
receptive to packaged teaching aids, such as the AT&amp;T
Adventure Club, a program developed for the
telecommunications giant by Scholastic. The program, which
includes student newsletters, classroom posters and teaching
guides, is designed to foster understanding of communications
and build AT&amp;T brand awareness among first-graders. "Teachers
are crying for the information," says Kathleen Redmond, youth
market manager for AT&amp;T.
   But many educators complain that companies are more
interested in expanding markets than minds. School officials
say marketers and their hired guns can't be trusted to
develop unbiased educational materials. Moreover, since
children under 16 years old are required to attend school --
and those in public schools are educated at taxpayer expense
-- classroom ads raise ethical questions.
   "Parents are entrusting their kids to the schools," says
Bill Honig, California's state superintendent of public
instruction. "We have no right to sell access to that captive
market."
   Gary Marx, associate executive director of the American
Association of School Administrators, says opening school
doors to marketers now will result in an intolerable
situation down the road. "Will we eventually be selling
one-minute spots in fifth-grade geography?" Mr. Marx asks.
"The classroom should be a marketplace of ideas, not
products."
   Marketers and publishers say they're providing a
legitimate service for schools. "Our mission is education,"
says Michele Magazine, a senior vice president at Scholastic.
"We are very careful that it's not just a disguised sales
pitch."
   Still, fearful that objections from parents and educators
will result in a backlash, many marketers already are
scrambling to blunt the criticisms. Many hold that Whittle's
Channel One irks educators because it's intrusive: Teachers
must agree to have their students watch the program most days
in order for schools to qualify for free TV equipment. The
real problem isn't the ads, they say, but the fact that
teachers are forced to relinquish control over the
curriculum.
   To make teachers feel empowered, Donnelley Marketing,
which distributes coupons and product samples, is soliciting
their cooperation in advance. The direct-marketing company
recently hooked up with Modern Talking Pictures Services Inc.
to query 100,000 home economics, health and gym teachers
nationwide. Modern Talking Pictures, best known for
distributing educational films to schools, has found about
10,000 teachers who have agreed to hand out an array of
product samples to their students this fall. Teachers were
even asked what products they wouldn't want in their
classroom, lest the samples offend anyone. (Among those on
various teachers' forbidden lists were contraceptives and
guns.)
   Along with the samples, some teachers will receive lesson
plans to help them lecture on such subjects as the role of
deodorants. And to appease teachers, the educational
materials won't invoke any brand names. "We truly have an
educational overlay, and we're there at the request of the
teacher," says Donnelley's Mr. Fenton. By next spring, Mr.
Fenton says, he hopes to reach 2.5 million students with
lessons as well as loot.
   Scholastic is counting on the credibility it has
established with educators over the past 70 years -- it
publishes 31 classroom magazines read by about 23 million
kids -- to help marketers ease into schools. Since it started
its own educational marketing unit about 18 months ago, the
New York-based company has signed up a roster of powerful
marketers interested in helping schools and burnishing their
image with consumers.
   Coca-Cola's Minute Maid unit, for example, was interested
in fighting illiteracy -- and enhancing the wholesome image
of its juice products. So in May, Scholastic helped
coordinate a program designed to encourage some 3.7 million
elementary school kids to read a book a week over their
summer vacation. Kids who sent away for a chart to keep track
of their progress also received coupons for Minute Maid
products. For each coupon redeemed, Minute Maid will donate
10 cents to a nonprofit organization that promotes reading.
   Despite the proliferation of marketing programs in
schools, corporate enthusiasm may not be long-lived. In part,
that's because so many companies are beating down the school
door that freedom from clutter may quickly evaporate.
Moreover, educators are poised to enforce tougher standards.
In recent months, the issue of commercialism in schools has
become a top concern for the National Parent-Teacher
Association, says Arnold Fege, a spokesman for the group.
   "Parents are getting fed up with marketers," Mr. Fege
says. "We can't just sell off our curricula to the highest
bidder."
