   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Triangle Corp. directors adopted a
so-called poison-pill measure designed to make hostile
takeover bids prohibitively expensive.
   The tool manufacturer's board said that Triangle will
distribute rights to buy preferred stock to common-share
holders of record July 26. Under certain circumstances, the
rights would entitle the holders to buy Triangle's common
shares at half price.

   Triangle's board adopted the poison pill in light of the
purchase of "an ownership position" in the company by Helmut
Rothenberger, chief executive officer of the Frankfurt
hand-tool manufacturer Rothenberger Werkzeuge AG.
   "Mr. Rothenberger has not filed a Schedule 13-D with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Triangle does not
know how much stock he (or any group of which he is a member)
intends to acquire," the company said.
   Triangle also said it doesn't know what Mr. Rothenberger's
"intentions may be generally," adding that he says he is
willing "to acquire more shares at reasonable prices."
