   MILAN -- Italy's gross domestic product in the first
quarter rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9% from the 1989 fourth
quarter and was up 3.1% from a year earlier, Istat, the
national statistics agency, said.
   The first-quarter growth rates compare with a quarterly
increase of 0.5% and a year-to-year increase of 2.8% in the
1989 fourth quarter.
