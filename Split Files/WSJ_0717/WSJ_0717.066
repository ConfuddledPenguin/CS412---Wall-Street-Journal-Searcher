   NORTHBROOK, Ill. -- Billie B. Turner apologizes that "it's
kind of hard to make fertilizer sound like a sexy product"
and then proceeds to entertain you.
   It's been 36 years since the Texas A&amp;M graduate joined
International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp. but there's a lot of
Aggie left in him. And as the head of IMC Fertilizer Group
Inc. since it was spun off from the parent in 1988, he needs
all the homely humor he can muster. Not only have the
company's sales been slow lately, but his industry is being
pressed on the pollution and nutrition fronts.

   "We've got the cheapest, most palatable, healthiest food
in the world in this country . . . and there are a lot of
people that want to fix that," he warms up. Although the Alar
chemical scare with apples was in somebody else's orchard --
IMC is the largest private miner of phosphate and potash, the
second and third most common soil additives, but doesn't
produce pesticides or other plant sprays -- he spits out
Meryl Streep's name as if the crusading actress were a wad of
bad chaw.
   A risk standard of "zero tolerance" is no way to live, he
says. "I don't know what zero is. I'm an old fuddy, but when
I went to college, we thought it was fantastic to be able to
test for parts per million. This was a big goddam deal] Now
they're talking about parts per quadrillion. That's one drop
of water on a damn golf course. It's about one small finger
of a Chinaman in China. I can't comprehend such things. If a
hundred-mile-an-hour wind hits Chicago and kills a hundred
people, they're saying a 10-mile-an-hour breeze comes
through, 10 people will die."
   Fertilizers haven't gotten quite the adverse attention
that pesticides have, but the issues are similar and Mr.
Turner is raising IMC's profile to fight back. He
acknowledges that abusive or sloppy use of fertilizers does
occur, leading to potential harm through runoff and
groundwater contamination, but says "economics dictates" that
the malpractice is limited to marginal cases, 1% or 2%. Most
growers "are not going to be putting expensive stuff on a
farm if you don't have to have it. There are a few dummies
out there, but most of them went broke."
   Usually the incentive for proper soil management is
personal, he argues. "Family farmers . . . are going to be
handing down to future generations. They're not going to foul
the drinking water on that farm. That's going to be the first
water to be fouled if they're going to foul it."
   But aren't those folks a dying breed? "Nearly all the
farmers in the United States are family farmers," Mr. Turner
says. "A high percentage of `corporate farmers' are there by
legal status to protect {the estate} when the patriarch dies.
And a lot of people are listed by the government as farmers
who are not farmers. I don't think we've called on a major
corporation in the United States in years to try to sell them
fertilizer."
   Asked what accounts for the current unease over his
products if it's so groundless, Mr. Turner points to the
organic-farming lobby. "They were trying to get legislative
definitions and restrictions that would protect the almost
incredible increase in price that they need for their
product," he says, putting that markup at 25% to 40%. Others
have joined the drive for their own political ends.
   "Organics want to take us back to Jeffersonian days.
Sounds kind of lovely, the clip-clop of horses and all. But
our problem in this country is not getting people back to the
farm, it's trying like hell to keep the ones who are there. .
. . We don't have a quarrel with the organic farmer. But it's
not for everyone. The winegrower in Napa looks at things
differently from the cotton farmer in {west} Texas. If you're
at Broken Elbow, N.D., the winters are going to freeze out a
lot of your insects. In the South, they're going to live
pretty much all year long. So this guy says `I encouraged a
few ladybugs' -- I'm all for that. But I do have concern over
anybody that gets carried away and says we're going to get
the farm bill changed and you're going to farm our way or
you're not going to farm."
   In addition to phosphate and potash, IMC also produces
nitrogen-based compounds, by far the most prevalent
fertilizer source. Mr. Turner chides those who "say natural
nitrate is great, and then they call ours synthetic. It's
made of very natural products, but synthetic is bad." He says
the environment can't tell the difference.
   Overuse of any substance can hurt. Holland, he notes,
spreads an "incredible" amount of animal waste over farmlands
and nitrate levels are high. Indeed, fertilizer (and
pesticide) usage abroad is much higher than in North America.
Economics columnist Warren Brookes recently reported that
France adds more than four times as much to each acre of soil
as the U.S., West Germany more than six times and Japan more
than nine times.
   "They are producing all out," Mr Turner says. "A number of
those countries have worshipped at maximum production. This
company is looking at maximum economic production."
   Although some U.S. producers complain they're at a
disadvantage in international competition because of
environmental regulation here, Mr. Turner doesn't want to try
to put all nations on the same footing, as has been tried
with chlorofluorocarbons and soon possibly with carbon gases.
   "You can make that argument but I think the prevailing
argument has to be that the Indians know best what's good for
the Indians," he says. "I suspect I know just exactly what we
would do: We'd stick a stake in the ground and say, by God if
you don't do it our way, we'll cut the trade off, you won't
have access to the World Bank."
   IMC has an interest here, because less-developed nations
such as Brazil, China and India are its growth markets. But
Mr. Turner sounds philosophical. "By and large, it seems to
me that decisions made further down are better than those
made higher up. Take reclamation. More people will put up
with {soil and water conservation requirements} if decisions
are at the state level."
   Farming is an example of government "industrial policy" in
action, and with all the direct and indirect subsidies it can
be hard sorting out competing claims. You start by
recognizing trade-offs in use of natural resources. Unless
their agenda includes reducing society's output,
environmentalists can see this in terms of minimizing the
uneconomic import of water into naturally dry areas. One way
to maintain economically justifiable agriculture production
with less water is by use of more fertilizer.
   Mr. Turner claims simply to want rationality. What is the
prospect? "It'll probably get worse before it gets better.
But I've got a lot of faith in this country and its system.
We tend to be pretty lethargic until we finally get around to
reacting to anything, be it segregration, quality of
education, road infrastructure. And then we kind of wake up
and we overreact. But time goes along and we find a
reasonable approach. And I think that'll happen here."
