   Moscow -- These are the things to say to make a Russian
happy: "Your country stinks." "Your leaders are criminals."
"I can't wait to get out of here."
   Russians have developed a passion for criticism. A visitor
here is constantly asked his impressions of the city. If he
tries to be polite, and balance the good with the bad, the
Russian listener pulls a sour face and looks away. But if the
question is met with a great gust of aspersion, then a broad
smile of satisfaction sweeps across the Moscovite's face,
before he concludes, "You've only seen the best of it."

   In this general atmosphere of eager self-loathing, the
cultural event of the moment is a scathing documentary on
Soviet life called "One Shouldn't Live This Way," by
Stanislav Govorukhin. It surveys Soviet criminal activity --
from rapes and mutilations committed by homicidal maniacs; to
the Baku massacre, organized at the highest reaches of the
Soviet government. The film's message is that crime and
corruption are the bricks and mortar of Soviet society. The
Soviet people love it.
   A film such as this still gets censored unless it has
powerful friends. "One Shouldn't Live This Way" has been
championed by the reformist mayors of Moscow and Leningrad.
Though it can be seen nowhere else in the Soviet Union, they
have ordered it shown in their cities. A friend had to stand
in line for three hours to get tickets for a weekday,
midafternoon screening.
   The first few minutes are searing. Mr. Govorukhin's
cameras show fresh murder scenes, with bodies carved open,
with relatives in frenzies of grief. Police photos display
nude women who have been raped and mutilated. One convict is
brought back to the scene of his crime to re-enact how he
lured a young girl into the woods, and then knifed her to
death. He is meticulous and almost cheerful. "It was quite
normal," he says, showing the various positions of his victim
as he stabbed her.
   It's not clear how much of this Mr. Govorukhin intends to
blame on communism, perhaps nothing more than the way the
criminals are completely apathetic about their fate.
   Mr. Govorukhin is on firmer ground comparing Soviet police
forces with Western police forces. He visits the South Bronx
and Times Square, a wry joke since these are the places where
Soviet propaganda units have always done their American
filming. "There is crime in the United States," he assures a
chuckling audience. But the director is amazed at how well
equipped the New York cops are. He goes into detail over the
design of the American holster, which allows the officer to
draw his gun in one motion. The Soviet holster requires
several cumbersome maneuvers.
   Mr. Govorukhin marvels at how New York cops show up when
they are called to minor health emergencies. He shows how 10
or 15 police cars race to the scene of even a minor crime,
when a Times Square pimp tries to force a prostitute into his
car. The audience is more interested in the pimp's car, a
stretch limousine, than in his crime.
   Mr. Govorukhin films a police funeral in Queens, with
thousands of cops in attendance. He determines that the
officer's family gets $500,000 as compensation. He then shows
a grim Soviet police funeral; the dead officer's family gets
nothing.
   He interviews some American cops, and while the audience
giggles, they complain how bad things are. One cop remarks,
"What we really need are some Soviet cops to restore some
order here." The film cuts to a pathetic-looking Soviet
officer, with an ill-fitting uniform and poor equipment,
standing dazed in the middle of the street like a
brain-damaged sheep. The audience erupts into gales of
laughter.
   The final comparison is between the living conditions of a
high-ranking Soviet detective and a German patrolman from
Hamburg. The detective and his three children have one room
in a small apartment, which they share with other families.
They sleep side by side on the floor. The audience members
begin talking to each other as the film shows the German
patrolman leaving work in his Ford Taurus. By the time he is
sitting in his modern middle-class apartment, the dialogue is
drowned out by audience members commenting on the various
appliances and amenities.
   One of Mr. Govorukhin's points is that communism has
turned honest citizens into criminals, and he shows the
underhanded maneuvers that are required to get anything
accomplished in the Soviet Union. One of the current
expressions, not included in the movie, is: "If you are not
stealing from work, you are robbing your family."
   A line outside one liquor store in the movie stretches to
infinity. At another, order breaks down, and young men become
like savage beasts, looting and scrambling off with their
cache. The old are frequently trampled in these humiliating
rushes, Mr. Govorukhin reports.
   Two old ladies live somewhat remote from these events, in
the middle of the countryside. They subsist on home-grown
potatoes, and remember the pre-Gorbachev days when it was
possible to get sugar. Mr. Govorukhin cuts from them to what
may be the most luxurious store in the Soviet Union, the
duty-free shop at the Moscow airport. Prices are listed in
rubles, but Mr. Govorukhin still cannot buy anything. The
prices are in gold rubles, a currency Soviets cannot possess.
   Next he shows a well-dressed Russian woman trying to book
a room in some of the better but still awful Moscow hotels.
Not only is she as a Russian forbidden from staying in these
hotels, the clerks do not acknowledge her existence. She
politely asks for their attention, but they ignore her with
that form of sadistic callousness familiar to anyone who has
tried to shop in a Soviet store.
   The crimes get bigger. The cameras fly over a gulag. Mr.
Govorukhin travels to Baku, to see ethnic fighting. But the
massacres take place away from the ethnic strife and the
victims are mostly dissidents. "This is the greatest crime of
all," he says.
   The film ends with scenes of the fall of the Berlin Wall,
with giddy East Germans delirious to be liberated from
socialism. As the lights come up in the theater, my Russian
host is shaking, and tears of rage and frustration run down
her face. It takes her a few minutes to compose herself. But
she invites us to her apartment.
   Like many Soviet apartment buildings, the hallways are
crumbling and smell of urine. But inside the apartment, she,
her husband and her mother-in-law have built a lovely home.
Beautiful Russian religious icons, some from the 17th
century, hang on the walls. Dinner is a generous helping of
fruits, pastries and a homemade custard. There is no way to
get material for a main course. Afterward she modestly shows
us some of her astonishing drawings and sings Russian songs
in an unexpectedly pure and brilliant voice. She is only 20,
her husband somewhat older, but they are astoundingly
well-read and can quote long patches of poetry, like many
intelligent young Russians. They give us flowers to take
home, and the afternoon leaves us with the impression, so
common in the Soviet Union, that the country has the best
people on earth and the worst.
