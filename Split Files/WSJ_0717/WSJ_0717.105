   Living With a Car
   Before Committing to It

   MORE AUTO shoppers are taking extended test drives by
renting, perhaps for a weekend, the models they are
considering buying.
   The idea has obvious advantages. Test drives at dealers
rarely last longer than 15 minutes or cover more than a few
miles. Moreover, weekend renters can evaluate a car without
having a salesperson around trying to hustle them into a
quick purchase.
   Howard Hirsch, 34-year-old owner of a garment manufacturer
from Woodland Hills, Calif., recently paid $750 to rent a
Mercedes 300SL for a weekend before deciding to go ahead with
a purchase of that model, for $78,000. "For 1% of the price,
you get to take the top off to see how it works," he says.
   Mr. Hirsch wishes he'd rented a Porsche 911 Carrera before
he bought one for $39,000 in 1985. Only after the purchase
did he decide that the driver's seat was uncomfortable, he
says.
   Rental companies don't have numbers on how much test
driving is going on. But they say they've noticed more people
asking for specific models these days, which they take as a
sign of test driving.
   Auto makers are getting in on the trend. Recently, General
Motors' Cadillac division gave free weekend rentals to
shoppers who test drove its models at dealerships. "It's
another way of getting people into our cars," a Cadillac
spokesman says.
                                                                                                       

   Insurance for Lessees
   To Cover All the Bases
                                                                                                       

   PEOPLE WHO LEASE autos now can buy insurance to cover what
their regular car insurance doesn't.
   "Gap insurance" is designed to protect consumers if a
leased car is stolen or destroyed. It also protects the
lenders who finance leases, a growing number of which require
lessees to buy the additional coverage.
   Lenders say the new insurance is important because there's
usually a gap of several thousand dollars between the unpaid
balance of a lease, which the customer must make good on, and
a car's fair market value, which the insurance company pays.
Lessees generally make a smaller down payment, if any, than
do buyers, so the gap between the unpaid balance and the
value of a leased car is wider for longer.
   "This is a protection whose time has come," says John
Vagnozzi, an executive in the auto finance unit of Chase
Manhattan. About a year ago, Chase Manhattan became one of
the first banks to require people who enter auto lease
agreements with them to buy gap insurance. Now the finance
units of Nissan Motor, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz all require
it. Before this year, only four major insurance companies
sold gap insurance; now more than 20 offer it.
   Consumers should watch out for abuses. Most gap insurance
policies cost $125 to $400, but some dealers have offered it
for more than $700. Mercedes-Benz decided to simply include
the insurance as a standard part of its leases instead of
allowing dealers to sell it separately, partly to avoid
questions over cost.
                                                                                                       

   Salespeople Angle
   To Get Some Respect
                                                                                                       

   PROFESSIONAL certification for car salespeople may sound
like an oxymoron, but the National Automobile Dealers
Association plans just such a program to elevate the image of
the trade.
   If not for scandal-plagued television evangelists, "we'd
be on the bottom" in terms of public image, says Raymond
Green, the association's president. "I want it so that a
consumer looks forward to talking to a salesman." But the
goal is also to help dealers. Turnover in the 200,000 auto
sales jobs in the U.S. runs about 40% a year.
   This isn't the first attempt the industry has made to
improve the image of salespeople, but it may be the most
comprehensive. Besides sales techniques, salespeople will get
training in contract law, psychology, social studies and --
yes -- business ethics.
   Toyota Motor and Ford Motor are developing their own
certification programs. Ford will ask salespeople to
recertify every year, while the dealers association
anticipates recertification every three to five years.
                                                                                                       

   Crash-Test Data Have
   Scant Impact on Sales
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS IGNORE the federal government's automobile
crash-test results, a study finds.
   Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth concluded that, over
10 years, published reports of government crash tests have
virtually no effect on the sales of the models tested. In the
tests, the government crashes cars into walls at 35 miles an
hour and measures the damage to the dummies inside. Because
lighter cars hit the wall with less momentum, they tend to do
better than larger cars in the results. The trouble is,
bigger cars do better in real life, partly because they're
safer when colliding with smaller cars, insurance-company
studies show.
   The government gave the Ford Escort high marks for crash
survivability in 1987, though the Escort fares poorly in
insurance-company data. Similarly, the government's test in
1986 panned the Ford Taurus and its Mercury Sable twin,
though insurance data rate these cars among the safest. Sales
trends for these models didn't change.
   The federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
says its tests are only designed to compare cars in the same
size class, not to compare big ones with little ones.
   "We have never maintained that these tests would have a
large impact on market sales," says Jeffrey Miller, the
agency's deputy director. But they do provide an incentive
for manufacturers to improve, he says.
