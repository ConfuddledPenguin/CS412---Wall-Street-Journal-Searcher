   French researchers reported promising results from a
10-year study in which they treated breast cancer without
surgery.
   In an effort to preserve the breast, the researchers used
intense chemotherapy and radiation as the primary treatment
of 250 women in the various stages of breast cancer. The
anti-cancer drugs and radiation caused the breast tumor to
disappear initially in all the patients, though 79 patients
subsequently suffered relapses of their cancer.

   The French report highlights a new development in cancer
research, the attempt to replace surgery with chemotherapy
and radiation in several kinds of cancer, said Vincent De
Vita, former head of the National Cancer Institute and now
physician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
in New York.
   In the July issue of Cancer, a journal published by the
American Cancer Society, the French physicians said their
latest analysis shows that all the women whose cancers were
caught in the earliest stage, when the tumors were still
small, are expected to be alive without any trace of cancer
five years after treatment.
   For women diagnosed and treated in the more advanced
stages of breast cancer, the expected five-year, disease-free
survival rates range from 82% in women with moderate-sized
breast tumors or cancers that had begun to spread to nearby
lymph nodes to 52% for women with large tumors and spread of
the cancer to distant lymph nodes.
   U.S. cancer specialists cautioned that the French
researchers didn't have a "control" group of patients who had
received the standard treatment of surgery followed by
chemotherapy. Therefore, they noted, it's impossible to tell
whether the nonsurgical treatment is any better than standard
breast cancer therapy.
   The new report, by cancer specialist Claude Jacquillat and
his colleagues at Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, shows that
it's possible to treat successfully at least some breast
cancers without surgery, the U.S. scientists said.
   "It shows conclusively that it is a doable kind of thing"
to treat breast cancer without surgery, said Bernard Fisher,
the University of Pittsburgh cancer specialist who has headed
several federally funded studies of breast cancer therapies.
The main unanswered question is whether the nonsurgical
treatment is as effective in the long term as the standard
surgery followed by chemotherapy, he said.
   An attempt to determine the new treatment's efficacy with
a "controlled" study is now under way at several
collaborating cancer centers in the U.S., Dr. Fisher said.
Half of the women volunteering for the study will receive
chemotherapy and radiation. They'll undergo surgery only if
the tumor isn't eradicated. The other half will receive the
standard surgery first followed by chemotherapy. So far,
about 600 women had been treated in the large-scale
experiment, about half the number that researchers hope to
enlist for the study.
   Dr. De Vita added that "we're trying to do the same thing
here {at Memorial Sloan-Kettering} with head-and-neck
cancer." By replacing surgery with chemotherapy and
radiation, doctors hope to preserve such patient's vocal
cords, he explained. "At this point, the results look about
as good as radical surgery" in head-and-neck cancer patients,
he said.
   "The whole field is new and very exciting, although like
most new fields, it has its troublesome aspects," Dr. De Vita
added. An ethical problem surrounds both the breast and neck
cancer studies in that researchers are asking patients to try
a new, unproven treatment when a treatment of proven
effectiveness is available. This is different from most
cancer research in which new, unproven treatments are used
only in patients who are beyond the help of any therapy.
   The French experiment extends recent efforts to get away
from a century-long practice in which the total removal of
the breast and much of the muscle underneath was deemed the
only treatment capable of curing breast cancer. In the past
decade, after years of controversy, less radical and
disfiguring surgery has been found to be as effective as the
radical mastectomy in curing the disease. Today, many women
whose breast tumors are only an inch in diameter or smaller
are treated solely by removal of the tumor -- a lumpectomy --
followed by radiation therapy, a procedure that preserves the
breast.
   The French attempt to do away with surgery altogether is
an outgrowth of research by Gabriel Hortobagyi, an oncologist
at the University of Texas' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston, noted the Medical Tribune, a newspaper for
physicians that first reported the French results. In the
1970s, Dr. Hortobagyi began using intense chemotherapy in
patients with very advanced breast cancer and found that in
about 15% of the patients, the tumors disappeared completely.
Dr. Hortobagyi said that in the last three to four years, he
has been using chemotherapy to reduce tumor size in patients
with earlier stages of breast cancer, making them eligible
for breast-preserving lumpectomy.
   In their report, Dr. Jacquillat and his colleagues said
chemotherapy alone caused breast tumors to shrink by more
than half in three-quarters of the women. In 74 of the 250
patients, the tumors disappeared completely after
chemotherapy alone. In all the remaining patients, the breast
tumors were eradicated by radiation following chemotherapy.
   The cosmetic results were "excellent" in 164 of the
patients, with treated and untreated breasts appearing
identical, the researchers reported. In 55 patients, the
cosmetic results were "good;" the treated breast appeared
normal, but slightly smaller, and there was evidence of
fibrous tissue developing from the radiation treatments. The
remaining 31 patients had "fair" results in which the treated
breast showed obvious differences from the untreated breast.
   The key question surrounding the study, as in most breast
cancer research, is whether the chemotherapy and radiation
wiped out not only the main tumor but any cancer cells that
had broken loose and had spread to other parts of the body,
the so-called metastases.
   As of the middle of last year, 72 patients had had
relapses of their cancers, 11 of whom underwent mastectomies
and six of whom had lumpectomies, the French researchers
said. The recurring cancers in the remaining 55 patients
weren't treatable with surgery. Forty-six of the women have
died because their cancers had spread to other parts of the
body, and six have died of causes other than breast cancer.
