   Oil prices continued a week-old run-up as more bullish
news came out of OPEC.
   In U.S. futures trading, the price of crude oil for August
delivery rose 31 cents to $18.67 a barrel. September crude
settled 50 cents higher at $19.85 a barrel.

   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, which had
set a new trading record of more than 50,000 contracts only
last Friday, gasoil (heating oil) contracts surged while
North Sea Brent crude for August was up 41 cents a barrel to
$17.84.
   But U.S. fuel futures set the pace as expectations mounted
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
come to grips with its overproduction problem. On the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the price of unleaded gasoline for
August delivery surged 2.49 cents to settle at 64.44 cents a
gallon. The September contract was up the limit of two cents
a gallon.
   Among yesterday's OPEC developments: The Iranian oil
minister arrived in Tripoli, where he visited the Libyan oil
minister in his whirlwind campaign to gain support for an
increase of $2 a barrel to $20 in the OPEC reference price;
the national oil company of Abu Dhabi, chief emirate of the
United Arab Emirates, told its crude buyers that it intends
to reduce production some 400,000 barrels a day in August;
and Kuwait reported a halt in spot sales, adding that it may
have to buy crude from others for its refineries.
   The Emirates and Kuwait, two chronic violators of OPEC
quotas, had pledged to reduce their production to 1.5 million
barrels a day each under terms of last week's proposal by
Persian Gulf oil exporters. The proposal, to be put before
all 13 oil ministers at the OPEC meetings beginning in Geneva
next week, is intended to lift petroleum prices by curbing
runaway production. It has improved prospects that all the
oil ministers will swiftly agree to freeze the OPEC output
ceiling near 22.1 million barrels a day.
   As previously reported, leading Persian Gulf producers,
including Kuwait, the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, are willing
to hold their output down now in a trade-off for larger OPEC
shares later. And Kuwait confirmed yesterday that at last
week's meeting of the five oil ministers in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, it was promised a higher production quota for the
fourth quarter.
   Rashid Salem Al-Ameeri, the new Kuwaiti oil minister, was
quoted by that country's news agency as saying, "The Jeddah
agreement affirmed the commitment to quotas and included
support for Kuwait to increase its oil production quota. This
would take effect during the fourth quarter of the current
year, after oil prices are brought back under control and the
current glut on world oil markets has been absorbed."
   So long as the OPEC news continues bullish, analysts said
other factors aren't having much effect on oil markets. The
American Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report on U.S.
oil inventories, which is due out today after futures trading
ends, is likely to influence the markets. But analysts
generally expect the institute to report another decline in
U.S. crude oil inventories.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of several hog futures
contracts rose their maximum daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound
amid a sudden tightening in the supply of hogs ready for
slaughter. Livestock analysts weren't aware of any specific
reason for the sudden shortage of mature hogs. But the hog
market is so volatile this year that a blip in supplies can
cause a wide price swing. In trading yesterday the price of
the hog contract for July delivery settled at 62.77 cents a
pound, up 1.5 cents. In the spring, hog prices soared to
record highs because farmers had been reducing the size of
their herds. In June, hog prices slipped as consumers began
resisting the high price of pork in the supermarket. So far
this month, hog prices have been swinging back and forth on
mixed signals. Supermarket demand is still weak. Yet
meatpackers sometimes have to bid up prices in order to keep
their plants supplied with enough hogs to keep operating. Hog
prices may get another boost Friday. Some analysts expect the
Agriculture Department to report that roughly twice the
normal rate of pork bellies was pulled out of frozen storage
in June, a reflection of the tight supply of hogs ready for
slaughter. Pork bellies are sliced into bacon. Also on
Friday, the government is expected to report that the fewest
young cattle in 15 years were placed onto feedlots in the
second quarter. Among other things, the small number reflects
the fact that an unusually wet spring improved the condition
of pastures. Through the winter, many ranchers were forced to
move their cattle to feedlots because dry weather had damaged
their grazing lands. Feedlots rapidly fatten cattle for
slaughter. Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said he expects the Agriculture
Department's 13-state survey to find that 5.1 million cattle
were placed on feedlots in the second quarter, down 2% from a
year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices at first extended Friday's
declines, but they recovered in late trading to recoup most
of the day's losses. The September contract ended at $1.22 a
pound for a decline of 0.95 cent. Prices on Friday fell
following gains of almost 20 cents a pound over two weeks on
production problems and concerns over supplies. As the
selling continued yesterday, the September price dropped as
low as $1.2060. According to one analyst, "Traders were
looking for a reason to sell and they found one,"
specifically news that workers at the Minero mine in Peru had
called off the strike scheduled to start yesterday. "The
potential strike in itself wasn't really very significant,
but since traders wanted an excuse, the impact of its
cancellation was magnified," he said. Late in the day, Reuter
reported an earthquake had struck in Chile. It wasn't known
if it had any effect on copper production, but it triggered
buying in futures that helped prices recover, analysts said.
Chile is the world's biggest copper producer. An earthquake
also struck in the Philippines; the amount of damage wasn't
immediately known. The Philippines is a medium-sized producer
of about 190,000 tons annually.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. August delivery
gold was off $1.20 an ounce to $364.50. September silver
declined 6.2 cents an ounce to $4.9030. October platinum fell
$5 an ounce to $481.80. A stronger dollar contributed to the
setback in gold, which didn't follow through on strong
advances Thursday and Friday. Gold rose Thursday because
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the central
bank was ready to ease monetary policy, and then on Friday
the bank cut a key rate by about 1/4 percentage point to
about 8%. However, Sharon Zimian, vice president of Citibank,
New York, observed that there was sufficient demand for gold
contracts to stem the decline. "Gold behaved quite well," she
said, despite the fact that "the surge in the stock market to
a record level surely must have drawn funds from the precious
metals." Another element that might have minimized the drop
was that traders were awaiting the issuance today of reports
on the trade deficit, industrial production and capacity
utilization, she said. The setback in platinum was mostly
profit-taking following Friday's sharp gains, said Nina
Lipton, research manager for Platinum Guild International, an
industry group.
