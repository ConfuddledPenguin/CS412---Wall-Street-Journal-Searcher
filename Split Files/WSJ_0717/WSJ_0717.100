   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s computer
unit is down to one president.
   Gordon J. Bridge, the former International Business
Machines Corp. executive who shared the presidency of AT&amp;T
Computer Systems with Richard A. McGinn, has been reassigned
to head a new unit within AT&amp;T's Data Systems Group.

   The new unit is tentatively named Global Messaging,
according to a spokesman for AT&amp;T Computer Systems. He
declined any further comment on the change, but said Mr.
Bridge's new unit will combine AT&amp;T's electronic messaging
business with those of Western Union Corp.
   Earlier this month AT&amp;T agreed to purchase the ailing
Western Union's Business Services unit, which includes telex
and electronic mail businesses, for $180 million in cash.
While the pact awaits Federal Communications Commission
approval, the two companies expect to complete the
transaction by Sept. 30.
