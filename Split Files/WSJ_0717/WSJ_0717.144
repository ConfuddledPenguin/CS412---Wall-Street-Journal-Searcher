   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association's big junk-bond sale
apparently moved a step closer to getting off the ground. The
troubled thrift's portfolio attracted bids at least within 5%
to 10% of its $2.9 billion book value despite tougher terms,
people close to the transaction said.
   Yesterday was the deadline that Columbia and federal
regulators had set for bidding for the bonds. And a person
close to the process indicated that at least one bidder had
offered in the range of $2.7 billion. Such a bid, if
ultimately accepted, could be a significant milestone for the
beleaguered thrift and government regulators.

   Columbia is insolvent, as previously reported, because of
$1 billion in losses and market declines in the value of its
junkbond portfolio the past several months. Most analysts say
any sale of the bonds is still unlikely to save Columbia from
being taken over by federal regulators and further
dismantled. Moreover, the complex nature of the sale and the
fact that it is likely to receive further intense political
and regulatory scrutiny make a completed deal still far from
certain.
   A few months ago, however, many analysts considered
chances of a sale of the bonds to be remote at best and said
the government itself would end up having to liquidate the
portfolio at a huge discount. Thus, the sale at a price even
within striking distance of book value could significantly
reduce any ultimate taxpayer losses from Columbia's collapse.
   Analysts agree that Columbia has benefited from a modest
reversal in recent weeks of the free fall that the junk-bond
market found itself in last autumn and winter. And many
analysts said Columbia's offer to finance 85% to 90% of the
transaction on a nonrecourse basis was a major further
inducement. Nonrecourse financing means that in event of
default, a buyer's risk is limited to the down payment and
Columbia essentially would be stuck again with the bonds.
   Such financing is also a controversial bet by the
government that the bonds won't drop sharply in value and
motivate the buyer to dump them back on the government, which
would then bear more losses.
   Likely bidders have included Loews Corp., Bankers Trust
New York Corp. and the Los Angeles financial-services firm
Broad Inc., according to published reports. Those firms have
declined to comment.
   Officials of Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
also declined to comment yesterday.
   The bond sale is required under a provision of last year's
thrift bailout law. The law and its subsequent interpretation
also require Columbia to carry the bonds on its books at
market value, although some people familiar with the bidding
said there was some disagreement over whether the latest $2.9
billion value is too high.
   In the end, Columbia apparently toughened terms for the
sale in response to government concerns, which apparently put
a lid on the bidding, some people close to the process said.
For instance, one person said the government hopes to see any
note issued as part of the sale be rated as investment-grade.
To that end, for instance, the person said the thrift was
proposing to rather significantly restrict the ability of a
buyer to freely sell the bonds that would secure the note.
   "Regulators want to go to Congress and say they got a note
back rated investment-grade -- that they are not taking back
a junk note for junk bonds," one person close to the bidding
said.
   Besides the junk bonds, Columbia has an estimated $100
million to $200 million in warrants covering equity interests
in many of the companies for which it holds junk bonds. Some
people close to the bidding indicated that the thrift may
have been marketing those securities as part of the junkbond
sale, which could further boost the final price.
   Yesterday, the Office of Thrift Supervision confirmed
reports that it had hired Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. to help the
agency evaluate the bids. Kidder once was criticized by
credit agencies and the New York Stock Exchange about its own
junk-bond holdings, which it recently sold to its parent,
General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn. An OTS spokesman said
the firm was chosen for its "substantial expertise." First
Boston Corp. has been Columbia's adviser.
   Columbia built its junk-bond portfolio into the largest in
the thrift industry in part because of close ties between its
former chief executive officer Thomas Spiegel and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond proponent Michael Milken.
   This month, the OTS filed an administrative complaint
against Mr. Spiegel, alleging that he diverted $19 million in
Columbia's funds to personal use; Mr. Spiegel has adamantly
denied the charge.
