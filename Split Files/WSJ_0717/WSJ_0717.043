   TOKYO -- Daiwa Securities Co., one of the top four
brokerage houses in Japan, is planning to set up a securities
company in Budapest in a joint venture with Hungary within a
month, a Daiwa official said.
   The new company will be capitalized at about $10 million,
of which Daiwa will take up more than 50%. The rest will come
from the National Bank of Hungary and the Hungarian Foreign
Trade Bank.

   Hungary, which is undergoing privatization of
government-owned companies and which reopened the Budapest
Stock Exchange on June 21, needs know-how on every aspect of
the securities business, the Daiwa official said.
   Responsibilities of the new company will include
underwriting of stocks issued by privatized Hungarian
companies, research and gathering information.
