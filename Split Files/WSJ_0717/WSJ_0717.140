   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. tightened its grip on Canada's
hottest gold prospect by agreeing to raise its stake in one
of the companies that owns the deposit. The move appears to
give Corona greater leverage in proposed talks with rival
Placer Dome Inc. over ownership of the property.
   Under the agreement, Corona said it will acquire 5.6
million shares in Prime Resources Group Inc., increasing its
voting control in the Vancouver, British Columbia-based
exploration outfit to 44% from about 34%. The shares are to
be acquired from several major shareholders, including Prime
Resources Chairman Murray Pezim, a director and honorary
chairman of Corona.

   Acquiring the shares "strengthens {Corona} without a
doubt. They are almost at effective control" of Prime
Resources, said Stephen Semeniuk, an analyst at L.O.M.
Western Securities Ltd. in Vancouver.
   Corona also owns 45% of Stikine Resources Ltd., Prime
Resources' partner in the Eskay Creek gold property, in
northwestern British Columbia. The property has estimated
reserves of about 4.8 million ounces, valued at U.S.$1.74
billion at current market prices.
   Stikine also is 45%-owned by Vancouver-based Placer Dome,
which bid for all of Stikine's shares in an attempt to head
off Corona's moves to secure control of Eskay Creek.
   Corona has said it will pursue talks with Placer about
merging Stikine and Prime Resources into an operating company
to develop Eskay Creek. A Placer spokesman has said the
company would "look favorably" on talks with Corona. A Corona
spokesman said no discussions have taken place.
