   JAPAN REPAYS A LOAN

   Japan repaid its last World Bank loan yesterday.
   Outstanding was the last installment on a 25-year, $75
million loan to the Japan Highway Public Corp. to finance a
segment of highway that runs between Tokyo and Nagoya in
central Japan, a World Bank spokeswoman said. The loan was
taken out at 6% annual interest in 1965.
   Between 1953 and 1966, Japan borrowed $862.9 million from
the World Bank to finance 31 projects, becoming the second
largest debtor to the bank after India. "The World Bank
provided money during Japan's roughest times," said Seiichiro
Yonekura, professor of business history at Hitotsubashi
University. "Without its help, Japan's postwar recovery would
have been inconceivable."
   Japan is now the second-largest contributor after the U.S.
to the international loan institution, bearing 6.69% of its
total shares. The bank also borrows up to one-third of its
funds in the Tokyo money market.
                                                                                                       

   SHUTDOWN IN ARGENTINA
                                                                                                       

   Twenty branch offices of Argentina's national mortgage
bank were closed yesterday, private news agencies reported.
The remaining eight branches eventually will be closed and
all 2,200 employees laid off, bank director Raul Chacon
reportedly said. The closings came without warning to the
bank's staff or clients. The government of President Carlos
Menem maintains the mortgage bank loses huge sums, is
overstaffed and poorly run. According to news reports, the
entity owes $1 billion to Argentina's central bank.
                                                                                                       

   SAS PILOTS' STRIKE
                                                                                                       

   Scandinavian Airlines System canceled two thirds of its
domestic flights in Sweden and one third of Scandinavian and
European flights yesterday because of a one-day strike by
Swedish pilots. The airline, whose Danish and Norwegian
pilots were working normally, said it would transfer
passengers to other airlines or arrange for them to travel by
bus. SAS said it was prepared to pay a 7% wage increase
recommended by mediators last week but only if the pilots
accepted a more flexible work schedule. The pilots say they
have already made concessions on working hours and have
threatened further strikes July 20, 23 and 27 if no agreement
is reached before then.
                                                                                                       

   ITALY VS. TAX EVADERS
                                                                                                       

   Frustrated by legions of Italian tax evaders, revenue
agents have begun boarding luxury boats to see if the owners'
income declarations are as high as their life styles.
Treasury officers checked out 217 yachts anchored in the Bay
of Naples over the weekend, RAI state television reported.
The report didn't say how many tax evaders were discovered by
the visits. But among the yacht owners was a man who had
described himself in tax forms as a street vendor with little
earnings, RAI said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW TOSHIBA NETWORK
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Toshiba Corp. announced that it has begun to build
an integrated communications network to link its overseas
subsidiaries and liaison offices in 220 locations in 36
countries. The network, scheduled to begin full operations in
December 1991, will include intracompany telephone, facsimile
transmission, electronic-mail and data-communications
systems. Toshiba plans to spend some five billion yen ($33.8
million) on the project and said it expects to cut
communications expenses by 35% a year.
                                                                                                       

   SPECIAL LUFTHANSA FLIGHTS
                                                                                                       

   Lufthansa, West Germany's national air carrier, will
operate two special flights to East Berlin in August, the
first time in 45 years the airline will fly to the city in
which it was founded. A spokesman said the airline received
clearance from the Allied powers to fly children from
Chernobyl, in the Soviet Union, to East Berlin for a
vacation. Lufthansa is seeking permission to operate regular
flights to Berlin by the end of the year.
                                                                                                       

   SWITCH FROM SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD
                                                                                                       

   Britain's largest jewelry retailer said it would stop
selling jewelry made with South African gold. The decision
followed pickets of its stores by anti-apartheid groups.
   A spokesman for the company, Ratners PLC, said the move
was part of a continuing switch to North American gold
supplies. He denied the move was in reponse to anti-apartheid
pressure.
   Ratners said South African gold is found in 2% to 3% of
its gold jewelry.
   One anti-apartheid group, End Loans to South Africa, said
it and other groups had applied pressure on Ratners in
response to African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela's
call to intensify sanctions and boycott South African goods
to end apartheid. The End Loans group said it has suspended
its action against Ratners and is asking other groups to do
the same.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Thieves used a three-ton truck yesterday to smash the
window of Asprey's, one of London's most renowned jewelers,
and escaped with a diamond necklace reportedly valued at
almost $900,000. The thieves reversed the truck toward the
New Bond Street shop, smashing its window with a girder
protruding from the back of the vehicle. . . . China needs 10
million tons of additional water each day to meet the needs
of 300 major cities that are facing water shortages, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
