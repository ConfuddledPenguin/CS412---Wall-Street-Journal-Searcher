   I've never competed in tournaments,
   In regattas, matches or meets.
   I've never attempted a field goal
   Or sprinted in trial heats.
   I've never skated a figure
   Or checked how a golf ball lies,
   But you would never believe it
   If you heard me criticize.

   Wanted: New Mottoes
                                                                                                       

   Those parents who quote an old adage
   Find today's kids quick to rebut it,
   For in dealing with the current generation,
   The old saws rarely cut it.
