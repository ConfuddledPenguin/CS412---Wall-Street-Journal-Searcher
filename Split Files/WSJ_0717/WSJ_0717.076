   Bamberger Polymers Inc., New Hyde Park, N.Y., said 11
members of its sales force in the Northeast and West Coast
divisions quit, which will have an adverse effect on
third-quarter sales and earnings.
   In the third quarter a year earlier, the plastics company
earned $159,000, or five cents a share, on sales of $41
million.

   Company officials said they would take "all legal action
available" if they determine that the sales employees "have
acted in concert to interfere" with its business
relationships.
   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange,
Bamberger shares closed at $2.25 a share, down 25 cents a
share.
   Officials couldn't be reached to elaborate on the
announcement.
