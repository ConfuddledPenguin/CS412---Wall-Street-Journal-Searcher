   Management Company Entertainment Group Inc. said it is
negotiating a 30-day standstill agreement with G.E. Capital,
a unit of General Electric Co., in connection with $72.5
million in loans that matured Saturday.
   MCEG, a talent management and movie production company
based in Los Angeles, said it is continuing to negotiate
refinancing arrangements with GE and other creditors. The
company said it is no longer pursuing a previously reported
agreement to restructure the loans into two series of notes
maturing in 1992 and 1995.
