   TOKYO -- Clients of Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc. are
used to being sold stocks, bonds and financial services. But
the latest product the firm is pushing comes straight from
above: American Express cards.
   Employees of the stockbroking and investment-banking
subsidiary of American Express Co. are soliciting members for
the parent company's credit-card operation in Japan. Instead
of the commissions that brokers are accustomed to earning,
successful card sellers earn prizes like cameras, golf clubs
and bicycles.

   Not surprisingly, officials at Shearson and American
Express don't see any conflict between selling stocks and
promoting credit cards. "A lot of these guys are taking this
seriously," says Marc A. Bouchard, chief operating officer at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia. Still, he adds, "we're not doing
it professionally. And, actually, most people who are being
asked are suppliers rather than clients. It's less
embarrassing."
   American Express says it routinely asks company employees
to promote its cards in Japan. "Shearson Lehman people are
part of the American Express family," says Yoji Takesaki, a
spokesman for American Express in Japan. "And all American
Express people are responsible for finding as many new
clients as possible." American Express employs 1,239 people
in Japan, including 320 at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
