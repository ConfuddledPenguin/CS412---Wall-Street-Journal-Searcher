   Kudos to George Melloan for his insightful essay on why
"Russia Hasn't Yet Tamed the Golden Hordes" (Global View,
June 18). I wondered, though, why he did not mention the
existence of the Birlik ("Unity") Popular Front Movement in
Uzbekistan, which now has a membership of well over half a
million.
   The rise of Birlik and other nationalist and pan-Islamic
movements in Western or Soviet-occupied Central Asia makes it
increasingly likely that what is happening now in Lithuania,
Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine may soon be happening in
the five Soviet Moslem republics. What is little noticed is
the effect this is having upon China's Moslem population in
Eastern or Chinese-occupied Turkestan.

   The recent warming of relations between China and the
Soviet Union have in no small part been due to their shared
worry over emerging Islamic nationalism on both sides of
their common border. Chinese intelligence claims to have
identified no less than seven separatist organizations in
Xinjiang province, including the Committee for the Salvation
of East Turkestan and the Alliance for a Free Turkestan,
Mongolia, Manchuria and Tibet. The Soviets and Chinese share
a nightmare of these organizations linking up with those on
the Soviet side -- and indeed, this is just what is starting
to happen now. Birlik, for example, is increasing its efforts
to reach East Turkestan Moslems.
   The various peoples of East and West Turkestan share a
common ethnic and linguistic Turkic heritage as well as a
common cultural and religious Islamic base. There may well
soon emerge a movement to unite both regions into one
independent nation of Turkestan, with Xinjiang seceding from
China and the five Soviet Moslem republics seceding from the
U.S.S.R. The new country would be as large as Australia and
have a population of some 70 million. Once this is seen as a
quite possible future by the Central Asians, and by Moslems
around the world, neither Moscow nor Beijing may be able to
do much to prevent it.

   I would like to correct a historical error in Mr.
Melloan's otherwise-informative article. He writes: "Central
Asians helped the Bolsheviks overthrow Czar Nicholas II." The
Bolshevik coup did not occur until nearly seven months after
the czar's abdication on March 14, 1917. Significantly, the
two central figures in the Bolshevik takeover, Lenin and
Trotsky, were in exile at the time of the formation of the
broadly based Provisional government headed by Alexander
Kerensky, a non-Marxist Socialist.
   It was the German kaiser who provided the train in which
Lenin and his fellow conspirators passed through Europe to
the Finland Station. By helping Lenin return to Russia, the
German military high command, in Winston Churchill's words,
"deployed the most grisly of all weapons" against its Russian
enemy. The Germans supported Lenin hoping that he would
overthrow the Provisional government and make a separate
peace favorable to the former, as indeed happened. Lenin
wrote of the First Revolution: "In a few days, Russia was
transformed into a democratic, bourgeois Republic, more free
-- under wartime conditions -- than any other country in the
world." Meanwhile, Trotsky, together with hundreds of
like-minded revolutionaries, secured his return to Russia
from exile in North America.
   The Bolshevik coup was indeed a multiethnic enterprise.
Lenin, the first "Soviet Leader," was a Russian traitor. (To
his associates who complained of his cruelty to his fellow
countrymen, Lenin remarked: "I spit on Russia. . . . This is
merely one phase through which we must pass on the way to a
world revolution.") Trotsky, an apostate Jew, was a violent
anti-Zionist. Stalin, the new commissar of national
minorities, was a Georgian and a dropout from an Eastern
Orthodox seminary. The fanatic Pole, Felix Djerzhinski,
directed the newly formed security organization, the Cheka,
which unleashed the Red Terror with equal fury against
monarchists, liberals and democratic socialists.
   Although the Bolsheviks did not overthrow Czar Nicholas
II, they subsequently (under Lenin's orders) did murder him,
along with the czarina, their children and their servants.
