   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said it
plans to move its headquarters from a building it leases here
to a company-owned building in Seal Beach, Calif.
   A spokesman said Rockwell is making the move because "we
believe the working environment in Seal Beach is more
suitable for a major corporate headquarters."

   The electronics and aerospace concern said it expects to
complete the move in January 1992. The move will affect 235
of Rockwell's 34,000 employees in Southern California.
Rockwell said its North American Aircraft unit, with 3,800
employees, will remain in El Segundo.
   Rockwell Chairman Donald R. Beall lives in Corona del Mar,
which is much closer to Seal Beach than to El Segundo.
"Needless to say, that isn't the reason for the move," the
spokesman said.
   He said that Rockwell plans to upgrade its building in
Seal Beach but that he couldn't provide an estimated cost of
these changes. He also said the company hasn't quantified any
possible cost savings from moving to the company-owned
building from the leased building.
