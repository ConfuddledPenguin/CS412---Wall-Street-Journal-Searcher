   Lam Research Corp., Fremont, Calif., said it will incur a
$14 million to $18 million after-tax charge for its fourth
quarter, ended June 30, to cover phasing out production of
its Gemini line of silicon-wafer fabrication systems.
   The semiconductor-industry equipment supplier said the
decision will result in a net loss for the fourth quarter and
the year. Lam said the Gemini line, which accounted for about
17% of revenue, had been unprofitable.
