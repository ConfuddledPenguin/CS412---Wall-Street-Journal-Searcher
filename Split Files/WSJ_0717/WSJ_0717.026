   FEARS STILL ABOUND of a disability law legal nightmare.
   As President Bush gets ready to sign the sweeping bill
banning discrimination against the handicapped, many
employers worry about lawsuits. Banking companies KeyCorp and
Society Corp., Ball Corp. and Oklahoma Publishing Co. warn of
possible jury trials and the threat of damages, fearing they
may eclipse conciliation.

   The law will be defined by the courts, but small firms can
ill afford big legal fees, complains the National Federation
of Independent Business. Airborne Freight is concerned it
won't be allowed to weed out job seekers who aren't up to
couriers' heavy lifting and driving tasks. But KeyCorp and
Texas Instruments figure it makes sense to accommodate
disabled workers.
   "We haven't found {persons with disabilities} to be more
litigious" than anyone else, a National Semiconductor
spokeswoman reports.
                                                                                                       

   EARLY RETIREMENTS may often be dollar-foolish, but they
persist.
   Heavy pension and retiree health-care tabs make it 34%
costlier to retire workers 55 or older than to lay off ones
from 40 to 54, the National Foundation for Occupational and
Environmental Health Research finds, in a survey of data from
100 large firms. Early-out bonuses offered by one large firm
studied by the National Bureau of Economic Research are too
big to be offset by lowered future wage costs, the group
concludes.
   But efforts to curb early retirements confront employers'
zeal to trim the ages of their work forces and many workers'
eagerness to retire before 65, the Employee Benefit Research
Institute says. Still, a tight labor supply and cuts in
retiree health benefits may help keep workers on the job
longer, EBRI says.
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIVES' HIGH PAY increasingly rankles the rank and
file.
   Boosts in top officials' salaries and bonuses breed unrest
among employees. "Salary-starved troops are looking on with
anger and cynicism as Mr. CEO's horse falls . . ., squashed
by the weight of his rider's bulging pockets," says Industry
Week. The magazine's poll has 62% of managers saying top
executive pay is too high.
   A study of 216 firms by consultant Sibson &amp; Co. shows
total compensation for top execs gaining an average 9.5% last
year, down from 10% rises in 1987 and 1988. "While the
compensation of corporate executives soared, worker pay
lagged behind inflation," says the AFL-CIO, in a paper titled
"Excessive Executive Pay."
   Lance Arrington, head of consultant Philip Crosby
Associates, says chief-executive pay is tied more to "the
CEO's relationship to the board" than the firm's profits.
                                                                                                       

   ALL OR MOST EMPLOYERS discriminate in hiring or
promotions, said 51% of 803 Americans polled by the National
Law Journal and Lexis reference service. Fully 62% would be
more willing to sue than five years ago. But of those who
said they had experienced job bias, only 2% saw a lawyer.
                                                                                                       

   WORKPLACE SMOKING CURBS get increased attention by states
and the local governments where smoke-restriction advocates
have more clout than tobacco interests. New Hampshire will
begin separating smokers in 1993. A commission urges
stiffening Maine's already-stringent law. Oregon groups will
try for a state curb, after two failures, and work for local
bans. Los Angeles and Montgomery County, Md., enact tough
anti-smoking laws.
                                                                                                       

   WAGE GAINS WIDENED through June 30, the Bureau of National
Affairs, a labor-reporting service, said. In 557 first-half
collective-bargaining settlements, covering 665,000 workers,
the median first-year wage boost was 3.9%, up from 3.5% a
year ago. Only 14% of pacts had lump-sum payments, down from
23%.
                                                                                                       

   HAIRCUTS GET CLIPPED as cost-trimming Upjohn Co. plans to
drop its in-house barbershops. The pharmaceutical maker plans
to close the subsidized shops at its Kalamazoo, Mich.,
headquarters and main plant by Dec 31. Upjohn has offered the
haircuts, now $8, since 1951.
                                                                                                       

   REGULATORY REVIVAL by federal labor-issue officials roils
some employers.
   Stepped-up job-safety, child-labor, pension and
immigration-rules enforcement sets companies such as Magma
Copper and PDQ Personnel Services complaining about paper
work and other burdens. The Labor Policy Association, a group
of large-company personnel chiefs, protests that large OSHA
fines for "egregious" violations were developed under a new
policy that ignored rulemaking requirements.
   Hormel says OSHA inspections are "more focused," but new
ergonomic guidelines "may impose problems." LaVal's Gardens,
a California pizza-parlor firm, says it paid $5,000 in
"ridiculous" child-labor fines. But Acmat Corp., Foxboro Co.
and Perini Corp. give OSHA high marks, and Perini finds new
pension rulings helpful, too.
   The OSHA crackdown is "long overdue" and will tell
employers "the stakes may be high" for violating safety
rules, says an AFL-CIO official.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Claude Messier, head of the asbestos miners
union in Asbestos, Quebec, quips, "If we die and are sent to
hell, at least we won't burn." . . . " Roger Smith {chairman}
of General Motors made only $2.5 million last year -- or
about the same as any ordinary baseball player who hits
.253," says Indianapolis News columnist Wendell Trogdon.
