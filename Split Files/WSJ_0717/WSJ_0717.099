   Maybe the way to pick an airline stock is to figure out
which carrier is in the best position to profit from
another's troubles.
   Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines fly on
financially weary wings. Eastern is operating under
protection of federal bankruptcy law.

   If one or more of those companies liquidated or sold out,
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines probably would be the
chief beneficiaries, several money managers and analysts say.
They would enjoy reduced competition on crucial routes. And
they might be able to pick up desirable airport gates and
routes on the cheap.
   Continental Airlines is generally considered too strapped
to do much buying. United Airlines has the financial strength
at the moment, but is preoccupied with an on-again, off-again
employee-led buy-out attempt. And if the buy-out succeeds,
United probably will have taken on too much debt to gobble up
planes or routes.
   Opinion is divided on whether Northwest Airlines, recently
taken private in a leveraged buy-out under the leadership of
Alfred A. Checchi, can afford to buy a rival major airline,
or its assets.
   Delta and American, by contrast, have decent balance
sheets and can afford to buy planes or routes if they wish.
Some money managers also like their stocks because they're
reasonably priced. Delta sells for only nine times the past
12 months' per-share earnings. American sells for 12 times
earnings. Both multiples are below that of the average stock,
reflecting the sluggish economy, fare wars and the industry's
cyclical nature.
   "When some of the weaker sisters are left aside, the other
airlines will grow stronger," says Thomas Longman, airline
analyst at Bear Stearns. It's "likely that fares will move
upward when you don't have carriers that need to discount
just to stay in business."
   Most money managers and analysts say that Delta would be
the chief beneficiary if Eastern stopped flying, while
American would be the likeliest to pick up any turf vacated
by Pan Am or TWA. Eastern is Delta's biggest rival at the
Atlanta hub airport, and also competes with Delta in Florida,
offering aggressively low fares. When Eastern's employees
struck in March 1989, Delta saw a quick 20% jump in revenue.
   Another money manager warns against counting on a replay:
Other competitors could fill Eastern's shoes. He thinks the
benefits from a major carrier's demise would be spread fairly
evenly across the entire industry. But the majority view is
that Delta would benefit most if Eastern falls. "Clearly,
Delta would be the beneficiary if Eastern goes away," says
Ned Davis, president of Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla.
   Pan Am currently has about 14% of the traffic across the
Atlantic. TWA has about 12%. Those routes could make a
tempting target for American or United, both of which now
have transatlantic toeholds. American is "making a concerted
effort to build up their east-west travel between North
America and Europe," says David Elias, a money manager in
Buffalo, N.Y. "If Pan Am did go under, they would probably
pick up a lot of that business, and at very reasonable
prices."
   Pan Am, says Steve Lewins, who follows airline stocks for
Chancellor Capital Management, "is attempting to make it to
Europe 1992" -- the scheduled date for the fall of most trade
barriers in Europe -- by selling off assets. "They keep
chopping up the furniture and throwing it into the fire,"
says Jeffrey S. Halis, a money manager with Gollust, Tierney
&amp; Oliver in New York. "I don't think they have much left to
sell."
   Pan Am has expressed willingness to be sold. But money
managers say potential acquirers are biding their time,
waiting for a truly low price. "The people at American are
very clever tacticians," says Michael Stolper, a San Diego
investment consultant.
   American doesn't need Pan Am's "management, employees {or}
computer systems," says Mr. Lewins. "What it wants are the
routes, the gates, and the slots. I don't think {American CEO
Robert} Crandall wants the baggage. He's playing the waiting
game."
   Mr. Lewins thinks TWA's routes would be a prize capture
for Northwest Airlines, which flies to Scandinavia and
northern Europe. TWA concentrates on southern Europe,
especially the Mediterranean. The routes "fit together like a
clamshell," he says. "The two are perfect together."
Northwest, however, "is still having digestion problems" from
the leveraged buy-out, says Mr. Davis.
   Kevin Murphy, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says it's
dangerous to predict the imminent demise of any airline.
"Airlines never die of a heart attack. They die a slow
death," he says, citing Pan Am's 20-year decline. Still, he
sees opportunities for strong carriers, saying Delta and
American could become the industry's "flying fortresses."
Michael W. Gunn, American's senior vice president for
marketing, says it's "premature to speculate" about any
possible acquisitions.
   Even for any acquirer, there are clouds on the horizon. An
acquisitive carrier's stock might take a short-term hit
because of costs associated with a takeover, such as the
tricky task of sorting out employee seniority. And some
investors don't like airlines dead or alive. "We avoid
airlines like the plague," says Roger Engemann, a money
manager in Pasadena, Calif. "They're cyclical, highly
leveraged, and intensely competitive. It's the worst business
in the world."
