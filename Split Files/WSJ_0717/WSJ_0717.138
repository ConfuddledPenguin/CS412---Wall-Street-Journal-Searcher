   Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank
N.V. said they reached a definitive agreement to merge and
predicted flat combined earnings this year.
   The two banks, which in March said they were discussing a
merger, plan to create a new institution, ABN Amro Holding
N.V. Based on current share prices, the new banking company
would have a stock market value of about 9.3 billion guilders
($5 billion). With assets of 402 billion guilders, it would
be among the top 20 banks world-wide.

   ABN shareholders have the right to swap their shares for
those of the new holding company on a 1-for-1 basis; Amro
holders are being offered two shares in the new company for
each Amro share held. The offer expires Aug. 17, and the two
banks said the merger could be completed by the end of
August.
   The merger plan still requires approval from shareholders
of both companies and various regulatory agencies.
