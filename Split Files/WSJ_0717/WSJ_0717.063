   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co., in an effort to jump-start
"disappointing" car sales, is telling dealers it will boost
spending for marketing its highest-volume cars -- including
slapping first-time incentives on the new 1991 Ford Escort
and Mercury Tracer subcompacts.
   Separately, Ford said yesterday it will invest $80 million
to construct and equip a state-of-the-art plant in Hungary to
manufacture automotive ignition coils and fuel pumps. This is
Ford's first move into Eastern Europe.

   The No. 2 auto maker's new effort to boost U.S. car sales
is outlined in a July 9 letter to dealers signed by Ford
division general manager Thomas J. Wagner. Excerpts of the
letter were published yesterday in the trade journal
Automotive News.
   In his letter, Mr. Wagner said the Ford division's
first-half sales performance is "disappointing to us all."
The division wanted 16% of the car market, but managed to get
only a 15% share during the first half, he wrote.
   The Ford division is the larger of Ford's two
car-marketing operations; the other is the Lincoln-Mercury
division.
   Worse yet, from Ford's point of view, sales of Ford-badged
cars trailed those of archrival Chevrolet by about 45,000
units as of the end of June.
   A key problem, Mr. Wagner conceded, is the weak start for
the 1991 Escort, which Ford designed with the help of Mazda
Motor Co. and launched with considerable fanfare this spring.
   Production problems on the new model and high supplies of
the old, less expensive version of the subcompact have
depressed sales of the 1991 model, Mr. Wagner acknowledged.
So now, Ford is scrapping its effort to sell the new Escort
without discounts. Through Aug. 8, it is offering $500 cash
rebates on all 1991 Escorts to first-time Ford buyers who
finance through the auto maker's financing subsidiary.
   In addition, Ford is offering dealers between $200 to $500
for every new Escort they sell, and is increasing by 50%, or
$11 million, its contribution to a fund that pays for certain
dealer advertising. That money is to be used during July and
August to increase advertising exposure for the Escort and
other Ford cars.
   A Ford spokesman declined to elaborate on the letter.
   But some Ford dealers say they're not sure if the new
package of incentives and additional marketing money will be
enough to boost sales of the new Escort and Tracer.
   "To clear inventories, they really need to do something,"
said James Hoffer, general manager of Jordan Ford, a
high-volume dealership in Mishawaka, Ind. He expressed doubt
that the program outlined in Mr. Wagner's letter will produce
a sharp jump in sales.
   But Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor,
Mich., said the goal of recapturing lost market share is
"realistic." However, he said, "we lost a lot of traction in
the Escort part of the market."
   A big problem, dealers said, was delays in rolling out the
Escort GT model, which comes with a more powerful standard
engine, and the station wagon version of the car. Mr. Wagner
said the production snags holding up delivery of those models
should be resolved by August.
   Meanwhile, Ford said it plans to build a 170,000
square-foot manufacturing facility in Hungary to produce as
many as 3.2 million ignition coils and fuel pumps for export
to Ford assembly factories in Germany, England, Spain,
Belgium and Portugal. Operations are scheduled to begin in
1992. Ford said it has Hungarian government approval to build
the plant on its own.
   Ford is moving more cautiously than some of its rivals,
notably General Motors Corp., to push into newly opened
Eastern European markets. GM announced in January it plans to
form a $150 million joint venture with Raba, the state-owned
Hungarian company, to build both cars and engines. The No. 1
auto maker also has announced joint ventures in East Germany
and Russia.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Ford shares closed at $43.625, down 62.5 cents.
