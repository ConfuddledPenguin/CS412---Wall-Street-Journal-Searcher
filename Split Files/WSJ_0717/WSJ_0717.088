   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co.'s second-quarter
earnings increased 12%, continuing its four-year string of
double-digit increases as productivity improved in all its
main businesses.
   GE said most of the gains came in its so-called
longer-cycle businesses, such as aircraft engines,
power-generation systems and medical equipment, where sales
cycles are long and where GE's manufacturing operations are
working off a huge backlog of orders.

   Some of the shorter-cycle businesses, such as appliances
and materials, did less well -- although the appliance
business still had "much higher" operating profit despite
roughly flat revenue.
   As a result, GE said its operating profit margin rose to
12.9% of sales, eclipsing GE's record of 12.1% set in the
year-earlier quarter. GE said the improved margin and strong
order backlogs in the longer-cycle businesses mean that the
double-digit earnings growth should continue through the end
of the year.
   The stock, after rising Friday in anticipation of the
earnings report, was flat yesterday at $74.875 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   "The quarter was in line with expectations," Mark Altman,
a securities analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc., said in
explaining why the stock didn't rise. "But that's not to say
the expectations weren't very high."
   Net income in the quarter totaled $1.09 billion, or $1.22
a share, up from $972 million, or $1.08 a share, a year
earlier; revenue rose 7% to $14.35 billion from $13.53
billion.
   In the first half, earnings increased 12% to $2.04
billion, or $2.28 a share, from $1.82 billion, or $2.02 a
share. Revenue climbed 6% to $26.95 billion from $25.43
billion.
   Commenting by product line, GE said operating profit and
revenue were both up strongly on aircraft engines and
power-generation systems. GE said it received about $2
billion of orders for power-generation systems in the first
half, with demand for gas turbines especially high.
   Among the other long-cycle businesses, technical products
and services had a "good" increase in operating profit on
"slightly higher" revenue as orders for medical systems
increased 15%. Aerospace operations -- such as radar and
satellites -- had flat revenue, and operating profit
declined.
   Industrial operations -- an agglomeration of businesses
such as lighting, electric motors and locomotives -- had flat
revenue, but operating profit was "well ahead" of a year
earlier.
   Among the short-cycle operations, revenue was flat for
appliances and materials. Although profit on appliances rose,
it was flat for the materials operations. GE said its NBC
broadcasting unit had "somewhat" lower earnings and revenue.
   GE financial services reported a 16% increase in earnings,
as GE Capital again did well.
