   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- MGM/UA Communications Co. said it
received a $53 million payment from Pathe Communications
Corp. as part of Pathe's revised $1.3 billion acquisition of
the once-mighty studio.
   Last month, Pathe and MGM/UA revised and extended the
$20-a-share proposed transaction, with Pathe agreeing to pay
MGM/UA shareholders an extra $1.50 a share. In the agreement,
$4 of the $21.50 is to be paid out by July 20 to holders of
record July 10.

   Under the original tender offer, Pathe already had
deposited $200 million into an escrow account as a down
payment on the acquisition. The $53 million represents the
remainder needed to make the interim $4 payment to
shareholders, who will keep the money even if the deal
collapses. If it goes through, holders would get the
remaining $17.50 in October.
   The prior agreement between the two companies had been
backstopped by a proposed $650 million loan by Time Warner
Inc. to Pathe. That agreement fell apart, Pathe and Time
Warner have sued each other, and Pathe is looking for new
sources of financing.
   MGM/UA also said that according to a ruling by the New
York Stock Exchange, MGM/UA shares had been trading on the
basis of one share of stock plus a "due bill" of $4 since
July 3. It is expected that the stock will begin trading
"ex-payment" one business day following the payment date, the
company said.
   The latest payment brings to $253 million the amount Pathe
has advanced toward the transaction since last March. Pathe
has also given MGM/UA a $75 million security interest in
three upcoming Pathe films. According to the revised
agreement, Pathe must deposit $50 million payments on Aug. 21
and Sept. 20.
