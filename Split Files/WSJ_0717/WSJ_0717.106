   HOLLYWOOD -- Live Entertainment Inc. set Oct. 4 as the
date for its video release of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
The Movie." It will be supported by a $20 million marketing
campaign as well as a cross-promotion with PepsiCo Inc.'s
Pizza Hut restaurants.
   The motion picture has grossed more than $130 million at
the box office so far, and a series of animated TV versions
released earlier in video by Live have sold more than 13
million units.

   Purchasers of the "Ninja Turtles" cassette will receive
coupons redeemable for more than $20 in free food and Pepsi
from Pizza Hut's 6,500 restaurants. Pizza Hut will co-sponsor
the television, print and radio advertising campaign.
   Despite the $24.99 suggested price, Live will provide
cooperative advertising to retailers who price the tapes as
low as $18.88. But some mass merchants are likely to price
the videocassettes -- which sell for about $16 wholesale --
even lower.
   Separately, Live, whose voting stock is 48%-owned by
Carolco Pictures Inc., also said it will change the name of
its home video unit from International Video Entertainment
Inc., or IVE, to Live Home Video Inc.
