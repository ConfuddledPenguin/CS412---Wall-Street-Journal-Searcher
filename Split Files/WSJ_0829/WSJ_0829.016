   To Americans who have enjoyed the protection of federal
deposit insurance since the 1930s, it may seem strange that,
until quite recently, such explicit guarantees were rare in
Europe. As recently as 1987, only six of the 12 European
Community countries specifically promised to reimburse
depositors of insolvent commercial banks. Today three EC
members (Ireland, Greece and Portugal) still lack this cover,
but an enabling act is before the Irish parliament, and the
others will follow, under pressure from the European
Commission.
   Germany's is the oldest of the EC's existing schemes. It
was set up in 1966, then strengthened and extended after the
Herstatt failure of 1974. But the principle of bank
protection is, of course, far older. In Germany, more than
500 local Sparkassen (savings banks) have historically been
backed by city or county authorities, which have legal
obligations to ensure that their associated banks remain
viable.

   In Britain, where there have been no large-scale bank
failures in more than a century, the Bank of England relied
until 1982 on careful supervision of a not very competitive
oligopoly, combined with willingness to act in extremis as
lender of last resort.
   In France it was official policy for many years, up till
the middle 1960s, to restrain competition between banks, with
a view to avoiding erosion of their profits and consequent
enfeeblement. National deposit insurance was introduced in
1980.
   Traditionally, guarantees by European governments, central
banks or banking associations have been implicit and
unspecific. It was widely felt that explicit guarantees were
unnecessary, and possibly harmful since they could encourage
imprudence -- an argument championed by Franklin Roosevelt
and, some would say, vindicated by the recent history of U.S.
thrifts.
   The arrival in Europe of explicit though limited
guarantees thus marks a retreat from traditional practice.
However, formal guarantees can have a very helpful influence
on depositors' behavior. They discourage panic withdrawals,
which could be based on baseless rumor, or on pessimism
unjustified unless self-fulfilling.
   Europe's guarantee schemes provide limited cover for each
depositor, generally excluding interbank and other wholesale
deposits. But the German commercial bank scheme is
exceptional in that each depositor is covered for up to 30%
of a bank's equity capital, as shown in its latest published
accounts. Maximum cover per depositor thus exceeds 1.5% of
the bank's total loan book, which is restricted to 18 times
equity. Few customers would hold deposits bigger than this in
any one bank; in practice, therefore, cover is virtually
unlimited.
   Elsewhere, guarantees are more or less tightly restricted.
In most countries, a large customer thus stands to lose
heavily from a bank's failure, unless the government or
central bank sees fit to supplement the guaranteed indemnity.
When Herstatt failed, the German banking association set up
an emergency fund to reimburse small depositors, but bigger
creditors lost up to 55% of their money. It remains prudent
for corporate customers to observe the caveat emptor rule: To
help them, specialist rating agencies are consequently
becoming more widespread in Europe.
   In the U.S., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was
set up in 1934. Comparable bodies in other OECD countries
date from the 1960s or later. America's early conversion to
the practice of deposit insurance reflects its banks' extreme
trauma in the early 1930s, but also the fact that insurance
schemes are inherently best suited to a fragmented banking
system.
   Paradoxically, large banks are the biggest contributors to
guarantee schemes by which they themselves could not hope to
be rescued if it came to the crunch. While U.S. banks
contribute around $2 billion a year to the FDIC, some leading
money center banks have domestic deposits of $25 billion or
more. Annual contributions by German commercial banks to the
Deposit Security Fund are estimated at less than $65 million;
each of the "big three" has deposits of more than $50
billion. The French scheme, designed to cover claims of up to
about $77,000, clearly aims only to rescue customers of the
smallest banks.
   In fact, deposit-protection schemes are not set up to cope
with the insolvency of a major bank, for which other remedies
would be needed. In several European countries this is
recognized by capping scheme contributions, so that the
biggest banks do not pay in full proportion to their size.
   One beneficial effect of deposit protection is achieved
even when a country's banking system stays trouble-free.
Guarantees are of abiding value to small banks that might
otherwise be considered less secure than the big names. This
appearance may be deceptive. A tiny bank may well have better
control over its affairs than a sprawling giant. Nevertheless
the fact remains that it has limited asset diversity, and the
perception remains that it could conceivably be allowed to
evaporate, while the giant could not.
   In Spain the Deposit Guarantee Fund, established in 1977,
not only insures deposits but also has powers to acquire
troubled banks for liquidation or resale. Many foreign
banking groups have gained a foothold in Spain by buying
rescued banks from the fund. In Germany the private
commercial banking sector embraces more than 200 independent
banks and, according to one senior official, "the Deposit
Security Fund is designed to up hold the diversity of the
private banking system."
   Why is Europe, increasingly a continent of few but large
banks, adopting habits that seem more apt for the U.S.?
Clearly one reason is the desire of consumers for fuller
protection and indemnity across the board. Another is that
for various reasons, including consumer pressure, European
banks now live in a much more competitive environment than
they did a quarter-century ago. These tougher conditions
erode the margins of safety in banking operations. Today the
banker's temptation is to enhance profits through riskier
activities. Many argue that guarantees strengthen this
temptation by insulating customers from the risks. Could
Europe's new safeguards facilitate debacles like those of the
U.S. thrifts?
   It seems unlikely. From 1934 until the recent disasters,
FSLIC insured thrift deposits with few untoward effects. It
was only after 1980 that passengers slipped between the
unmoored boat of deposit rates and the dock of fixed-rate
mortgages; while 1980s supervisory procedures could not
handle far-reaching changes in the thrifts' business methods.
   Across Europe, banking like other business sectors has
tended to coalesce into fewer bigger companies. Within the
Community, cross-border integration seems likely to carry
this trend further. But a directive on its way from Brussels
will soon require all 12 countries to maintain deposit
protection schemes. These will offer reassurance and enhance
confidence in an age of volatility. They should also
encourage the independent survival of small local banks, even
as their bigger brethren continue to merge.
