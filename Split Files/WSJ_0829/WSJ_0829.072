   James Bovard's `Apologists for the Farm Lobby" (editorial
page, July 24) left this farmer guessing again. Who is this
James Bovard? What is the Cato Institute? Why does he get to
express his views about U.S. agriculture all the time?
   Mr. Bovard enjoys telling how much the American consumer
is paying in higher food costs. Yet the efficiencies of the
U.S. farm sector have allowed people to leave the farm and
pursue other professions -- such as being an "analyst."
