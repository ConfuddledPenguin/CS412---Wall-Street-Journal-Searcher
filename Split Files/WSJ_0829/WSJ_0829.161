   Saddam Hussein is an evil man who has no qualms about
hurting innocent people. But many Americans believe that if
he were to succeed in extending his control to a large part
of the Arab world, he could severely damage the oil-dependent
U.S. economy. No less an authority than Henry Kissinger has
claimed that an unchecked Saddam would be able to "cause a
world-wide economic crisis."
   But is it true that Saddam Hussein can impose large costs
on our economy? Economic analysis of the oil market answers
with a resounding, No. The annual cost to the U.S. economy of
doing nothing in the Gulf would be less than half of 1% of
the gross national product. The vaunted oil weapon is a dud.

   One thing Saddam cannot do is cause oil shortages and
gasoline lines. Only the U.S. government can do that. As long
as the government avoids imposing price controls, any cutback
in supplies that Saddam causes will translate into higher
prices, not shortages. That is the lesson learned from the
1970s. Countries like the U.S. that impose price controls
caused Soviet-style queues. Countries like Switzerland that
avoided price controls made it through the 1970s with no
lines.

   That's no surprise. If governments let oil prices rise,
people eliminate marginal uses while continuing to use oil
where it is most valuable. They take fewer trips to the
stores and fewer driving vacations, but don't stop driving to
work. Utilities switch from oil to natural gas. People
insulate their houses and close off unused room. In a
thousand different ways, oil users make subtle adjustments
that -- voila -- cause the amount they consume to equal
exactly the amount supplied. The market works.
   Of course, Saddam does not have to create gasoline lines
to hurt the U.S. Increases in the price of oil, even without
shortages, hurt the U.S. economy. But they hurt less than
most people think.
   Take the worst case that has any plausibility whatsoever.
Assume that Iraq holds onto Kuwait and grabs Saudi Arabia
plus the United Arab Emirates. Iraq would then control
virtually all Middle Eastern oil production, except for
Iran's.
   The Middle Eastern oil fields had been producing about
12.3 million barrels per day before the price run-up in late
July. They will go on producing something: Saddam may be
evil, but he is not stupid. He does not want to seize the oil
fields only to leave them idle. He wants them so that he can
sell their oil.
   If Saddam sold the same 12.3 million barrells per day as
were being sold before the invasion of Kuwait, the effect of
his actions on the world price of oil would be zero. Oil
would sell for the pre-crisis price of about $20 per barrel.
   ---
   Obviously, Saddam doesn't intend to sell the same level of
output. By controlling the outputs of four major OPEC cartel
members Saddam would gain monopoly power over Persian Gulf
oil. He would no doubt use this power to cut the combined
production to drive up the world price of oil. The
revenue-maximizing level of output from the Persian Gulf
fields is no less than 8.3 million barrels a day -- a 4
million barrells per day production cut.
   That is less awesome than it sounds. Remember that Saddam
is operating in a market in which world output is about 60
million barrels per day. The loss of 4 million barrels is
thus a 6.7% cut in world output. Granted that in the
short-run the demand for oil is fairly inelastic. Small cuts
in production can therefore cause large increases in world
prices. Adopting the grimmest end of the economists' range of
estimates of elasticity, a 6.7% cut in world production would
cause a 35% rise in price, to about $27 per barrel from the
pre-crisis price of $20.
   Before the crisis, the U.S. was importing about 8 million
barrels of oil a day. If the U.S. were to import the same
amount rather than increasing domestic production or reducing
consumption, it would pay $56 million per day extra for its
imports. This amounts to $20.5 billion per year.
   Now $20.5 billion is not small change. But put the figure
into perspective. It is less than 1/2 of 1% of America's $5
trillion GNP. A loss of 1/2 of 1% of GNP is surely not what
Henry Kissinger had in mind when he referred to an "economic
crisis."
   At the gasoline pump, the cost would show up as an added
17 per gallon on top of the old price of about $1.09 -- a
total of about $1.26, less than motorists are paying now.
Total cost per American per year of the price hike would be
less than $80.

   Consider, by contrast, the costs of war. Sending troops to
the Gulf has not been cheap. The U.S. spent an estimated $2
billion extra in the first two weeks of the operation.
Staying there a year, or fighting, would probably cost much
more than $20.5 billion in added spending. Nor is this
spending the only cost of intervening, as the plight of the
hostages makes clear.
   Remember also that the U.S. embargo of Kuwait and Iraq
ensures that less oil will be produced. As a result, oil
prices will stay high, which is presumably one of the
outcomes the administration wanted to prevent.
   The $20.5 billion tax that Saddam can levy on the American
economy is only a short-run cost. The longer he restricts oil
production, the less annual damage he can inflict. At the
higher price of oil, other oil producers will produce more,
as is already happening. Moreover, according to energy
economists Arlon Tussing and Sam Van Vactor, at $25 per
barrel, many subsititutes for oil become economically
feasible. The bottom line: Whatever other justifications
there may be for war with Saddam, cheap oil isn't one of
them.
