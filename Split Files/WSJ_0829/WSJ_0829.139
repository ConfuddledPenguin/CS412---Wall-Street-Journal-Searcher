   An investment group that includes Steinhardt Partners
Limited Partnership, which hinted in the past that it may
consider seeking control of USAir Group Inc., said it raised
its stake in the Washington, D.C., airline company to 9.46%.
   The disclosure was made in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, which shows that the group, including the
Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt, now holds 4,232,600
USAir shares, including 474,000 bought from June 26 to last
Friday for $14.07 to $25.83 a share. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, USAir shares closed at
$15.875, down 37.5 cents.

   The Steinhardt partnership has held a stake in USAir for
more than two years, gradually increasing its holding. Its
SEC filing said nothing about its intentions in acquiring the
additional USAir stock, but Mr. Steinhardt was said to have
believed that the stock was attractive because its price was
low. He was unavailable to comment. A USAir spokesman
declined to comment.
