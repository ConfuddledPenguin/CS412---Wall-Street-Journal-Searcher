   Justin Industries Inc. of Dallas, which has launched a
tender offer for Tony Lama Co., said it intends to refinance
substantially all of Tony Lama's debt with a new $35 million
term-loan facility if the merger is completed.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Justin said it is currently discussing the loan facility with
banks. The company said the refinancing will depend on market
conditions generally and upon whether credit is available on
satisfactory terms.

   Justin is offering $9 a share, or about $18 million, for
Tony Lama, plus the assumption of about $34 million in debt.
Both companies are makers of boots, although Justin also
makes building materials and industrial equipment.
   As reported, a group holding about 12% of Justin sharply
criticized the proposed Tony Lama acquisition and asked
Justin to give its shareholders the chance to vote on it.
Justin officials haven't complied.
