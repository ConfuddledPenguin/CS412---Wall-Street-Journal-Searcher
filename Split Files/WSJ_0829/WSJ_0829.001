   The Mideast crisis is driving up costs and sharply
reducing revenue for tanker owners, setting back the
industry's three-year recovery.
   Shipping executives say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the
embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil has caused ship-fuel costs
to double, curtailed cargoes, led to overcapacity and shaved
tanker rates between 15% and 20%. Deprived of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti cargo, 30 of the world's largest tankers are now
lined up outside the Persian Gulf, compared with five to 10
normally, according to E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd., London.

   Tanker owners expect to realize some relief as other
oil-producing nations, notably Saudi Arabia, boost oil
outflow. But they say it would take several months to work
off the current surplus of big tankers idled outside the
Persian Gulf. Shipowners are less than enthusiastic about the
prospect of increased oil shipments from Venezuela and Mexico
to the U.S., which involve substantially less transportation
than is needed to move oil from the Persian Gulf.
   And tanker executives worry that higher energy prices will
lead to slower economic activity and long-term reduced demand
for ocean transportation. "The world will be long on tankers
for some time to come," said Paul Slater, chairman of First
International Group of Cos., a ship finance and leasing
company in Naples, Fla.
   All this is particularly disappointing to tanker
executives, because it threatens to undermine the industry's
recovery from the prolonged shipping depression that lasted
through the mid-1980s. Tanker-charter rates have increased
solidly in recent years, leading shipowners to place orders
for new tankers. But the Mideast crisis "puts the tanker
industry on a nervous alert again just as it had reached a
period of stability," said Mr. Slater.
   The most significant effect is on the largest tankers, the
so-called very large crude carriers and ultralarge crude
carriers designed to take vast amounts of Mideast oil long
distances -- to Europe, Japan and the U.S. Short-term spot
charter rates for the big ships have dropped to about $12,000
a day from between $15,000 and $18,000 a day earlier in the
summer, according to James Winchester, an analyst at Mabon,
Nugent &amp; Co.
   Meanwhile, bunker fuel prices have climbed to about $140 a
metric ton in Rotterdam from about $90 a few weeks ago.
Insurance costs for tankers operating in the Persian Gulf
have climbed as much as tenfold, reflecting war-risk
premiums.
   "You still cover your operating costs, but not by much,"
said Louis Anderson, president of Papachristidis U.S.A.,
agent for Hellespont Group, which controls 24 tankers. Mr.
Anderson said one big Hellespont tanker will later this week
join the vessels lined up outside the Persian Gulf awaiting
cargo.
   Mr. Anderson said the company is slowing the travel speed
of some tankers to save fuel and, in effect, reduce capacity.
Ship brokers said other tanker companies are putting some
ships in yards for repairs and maintenance. But shipowners
said they are unlikely to mothball their surplus tankers as
long as there is hope that demand for the vessels may
increase.
   The embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil that has idled
supertankers may prove a boon for medium-sized tankers of
80,000 to 90,000 deadweight tons. Such vessels would be in
greater demand if the flow of oil to the U.S. from Venezuela
and Mexico increases, said one tanker-company executive.
   Harry Wheeler, a director of E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers, said
that historically the tanker market has benefited from world
conflicts. For example, the 1967 closing of the Suez Canal
following the Arab-Israeli war lengthened tanker voyages from
the Mideast to Europe and the U.S., creating a greater demand
for the ships. "For tanker owners, some disasters are
beneficial and others are detrimental," Mr. Wheeler said.
"This one is detrimental because it decreases the supply of
oil and potentially shortens the length of tanker voyages."
