   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev may indeed need to
accelerate privatization in the Soviet Union. However, Paul
Klebnikov's portrayal of czarist Prime Minister Piotr
Stolypin as Russia's savior is mistaken (editorial page, July
24). Was democracy in Czar Nicholas II's Russia, as Mr.
Klebnikov postulates, a genuine goal of Stolypin, through the
means of property ownership? I do not think so.
   Stolypin believed that hereditary autocracy should yield
to limited monarchy in order to save that institution. He
grasped the political significance of factions, seeking to
enlist the support and allegiance of the Russian peasants
through land reform, i.e., release from communal land and a
program of state loans. Those incentives were designed to
create a pro-government peasantry as a counterweight to the
urban proletariat. He also encouraged emigration to Siberia
to avert perceived population pressures.

   His land reforms were promulgated temporarily without the
approval of the Russian Duma. But World War I brought land
reform to a standstill and the partition of large estates
among the peasants did not take place.
   Mr. Gorbachev may salvage his power and that of his
cohorts through consumer goods and economic amelioration.
However, he is more likely to accomplish the task by
instituting authentic democratic reform and direct
participation in the political process by the Soviet masses.

   ---
   Mr. Klebnikov has ably called to our attention the
economic reforms of Stolypin that, through massive
privatization, transformed late czarist Russia into an
economic superpower. In recent years, U.S. authorities have
actively promoted privatization overseas in order to
encourage both the Third World and Eastern Europe to reenter
the international economy. So could the U.S. benefit from the
philosophy it exports.
   I would be very pleased to privatize a host of the
"essential services" and "priorities" for which my pockets
now are emptied. Included would be (a) free needles for
addicts; (b) condom programs; (c) abortion; (d) bailouts (e)
military offensive, rather than defensive, preparedness, and
(f) subsidies and entitlements for the good Lord only knows
what.
   As to the foreign-aid "hawks," instead of fleecing us for
countries most Americans can't locate on the map, I suggest
they lobby Washington to permit nations with which we have
full diplomatic relations to issue bonds in our markets free
of the current registration requirements. As a former
diplomat and longtime international financial officer, I'm
confident of the market's efficacy here.
