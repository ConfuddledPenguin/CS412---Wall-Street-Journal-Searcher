   From an editorial titled "What Price Iraq?" in the Aug. 17
Forward, an English-language Jewish weekly:

   As the Gulf crisis rolls into its third week an increasing
number of Jews are growing quietly concerned at the way the
Bush administration is handling the international politics of
the situation. . . . This feeling stems from the
assiduousness with which Messrs. Bush and Baker are avoiding
any overt reference to the long-standing American-Israeli
friendship. Israel's government has long warned of the threat
from Iraq, sharing intelligence and giving advance warning.
On the eve of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Defense Minister
Arens raised the alarm in Washington, albeit in private.
Since then Israel has gamely kept in the background, not
wanting to embarrass a friend and patron. This has seemed all
too pleasing to the Bush administration -- to a degree that
makes it seem a bit cringing. It may be heartening to see
some of the Arab countries step up to their responsibilities.
But what is the worth of this alliance to America if the
price of it is a snub to the one genuinely staunch friend
it's had in the region?
