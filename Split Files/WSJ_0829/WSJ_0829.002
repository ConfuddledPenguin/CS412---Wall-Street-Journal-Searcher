   They were known as the "Watergate babies." The 75
Democrats elected to the House in their party's 1974
landslide represented the arrival of a generation of
idealistic post-New Deal liberals in Congress. They led a
mini-revolution in the House by ousting three powerful
Southern committee chairmen and giving the Democratic Caucus
the power to enforce party discipline. To a remarkable
extent, today's Congress is run by the 50 or so members of
the Class of '74 who haven't been defeated or gone on to
other offices.
   Last week, one of those who lost his seat, Edward Pattison
of New York, became, at age 58, the first Watergate baby to
die of natural causes. Mr. Pattison remained a civil
libertarian and social liberal until his death. But unlike
his colleagues who stayed in office, Mr. Pattison became
increasingly suspicious of governmental intervention in the
economy and appalled at the "bloated beast" he felt Congress
had become.

   I first spoke with him in February, when he was already
ill with cancer. I knew he was one of several former
Democratic members backing term limits on Congress. I
expected a pro forma chat when I called him at his home near
Troy, N.Y. Instead, I had the first of several long talks
with a man who had thought deeply about why government no
longer was capable of doing the things he had wanted it to do
while he was in Congress.
   "There are simply a lot of things the government will
never do well," he told me. "The problem neo-liberals have
today is while they want to oppose special-interests, they
are committed to voting more money for some of the most
rigid, unresponsive bureaucracies ever created."
   Ned Pattison was the first Democrat to represent his
upstate New York district since the Civil War. Unlike many of
his Class of '74 colleagues who trimmed their liberal sails,
Mr. Pattison voted a strict liberal line in Congress. That
record, coupled with an admission that he had smoked
marijuana, cost him his seat in 1978. Mr. Pattison didn't
follow the usual course by staying in Washington and lobbying
his former colleagues. He served as a fellow at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government and then returned home to
practice law.
   Over time he abandoned liberalism and became interested in
Jeffersonian ideas. He found the work of the libertarian Cato
Institute "fascinating." He remained skeptical of
conservatives because he said they had their own ideological
blind spots, namely blank-check spending on dubious military
programs: "They couldn't see the Pentagon was like any other
bureaucracy, the post office with guns."
   A former county official, Mr. Pattison felt the federal
government had grown beyond "human scale" and could
accomplish few of its purported goals. To him, federalism was
an idea to be rescued from dusty history books. He admired
Charles Murray's 1988 book, "In Pursuit of Happiness," which
argues that "little platoons" of communities and voluntary
associations can best handle most social problems.
   Mr. Pattison frequently returned to Washington as chairman
of the Congressional Institute on the Future and to visit the
now-graying Watergate babies. He found friends who were
finally wielding the levers of power, but enjoying it less
and less. "I'd never thought I'd see the House gym so well
used," he said. "A lot of members realize they're engaged in
playacting, merely managing a bureaucratic empire they came
to Washington to change."
   He came to regret the role he played in building up
Congress's power to micromanage the federal government. He
was especially critical of how he and his fellow Watergate
babies perfected the skills of incumbency protection and
constituency service. "There is no justification for
constituency service the way it's done today," he said.
"Members don't act as ombudsmen waiting for people to come to
them; they're out soliciting business. It's a bureaucracy
within a bureaucracy. Over half of the staff works on
constituent service to re-elect their boss."
   Congressional reform was a favorite topic of his. His
1990s version started with limiting members of Congress to 12
years of service. "You wouldn't believe how many members
privately tell me it's a good idea," he said during a
luncheon meeting earlier this year. Other reforms would
include limiting members to one district office, cutting
current staff levels in half and sharply limiting the amount
of franked mail propaganda a member could send out. "I'd
finish up by doing something about the dirty secret of
American politics: gerrymandering," he said with a smile.
   Inspired to enter politics by John F. Kennedy, Mr.
Pattison ended up having little use for his party's leaders.
"I couldn't believe Dick Gephardt and his Japan-bashing," he
said, shaking his head. "Even the White House isn't worth
doing things like that." As for 1988 nominee Michael Dukakis:
"Michael always confused governmental process with progress."
   As we left the country restaurant where we had lunched, I
asked him why he had been so candid. "It's said that a
statesman is a politician who is no longer in office," he
said. "Well, the definition of someone who tells it like it
is could be someone who is soon checking out of life."
