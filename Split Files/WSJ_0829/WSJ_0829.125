   There is "Trouble in Super Marioland," as Alex Kozinski
says (Leisure and Arts, July 27), but its cause is not a
"lack of effective competition." The trouble is intense
competition from new technology and new creativity.
Nintendo's system is based on a seven-year-old eight-bit
technology. What's new are 16-bit game systems and a flood of
new games for both NEC's Turbo Grafx-16 and Sega. The new
technology provides faster, more colorful, more complex
games. NEC even has a special CD-ROM reader that connects to
its game machine and provides real voices, real music and
therefore has the ability to go beyond the usual shoot and
race games. It's as if there were only action films and we
suddenly discovered drama, mysteries, musicals and comedies.
   Last year at this time there were no 16-bit games. But
this year there are. In Japan for example, in just over two
years 16-bit sales have taken more than half of the market
and Nintendo faces a tough near-term future. According to two
surveys, more than 30% of current Nintendo-owning boys in the
U.S. plan to get a new system this year.

   I don't think it's time yet for Mario's wake, but with the
increased competition from such 16-bit systems as NEC's Turbo
Grafx-16, Mario and Luigi might be looking over their
shoulders as we enter a higher level in the video "game."

   With all due respect to Judge Kozinski, I believe he has
missed the point in his critique of Nintendo.
   He is correct that "the video-games aisle at the Toys `R'
Us often is deserted." But this was July, when parents
encourage their children to play outdoors. Nintendo is
overwhelmingly indoor entertainment. A check of the Nintendo
aisle on Oct. 1 will reveal a very different situation.
   If there is a "lack of effective competition" in the U.S.
video-game market, as Mr. Kozinski claims, this problem
should not be laid at the doorstep of Nintendo. There are
competitive game systems offered by Sega, Atari and NEC.
Nintendo outsells them all together by about 9 to 1.
   Absolute Entertainment, together with sister company
Imagineering Inc., is the largest U.S.-owned developer of
Nintendo video games. Since entering the Nintendo development
business in 1988, we have not had any project stopped,
questioned or rejected by Nintendo because it has not
conformed to some mysterious standards established by the
mythical "Nintendo censor." Overwhelmingly, Nintendo's
analysis of our work is in the form of technical review and
program-bug hunting.
