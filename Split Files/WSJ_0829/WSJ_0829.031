   NEW YORK -- The superstars of Wall Street's junk-bond
departments are steadily falling by the wayside.
   Yesterday, Raymond Minella and Jeffrey Berenson -- the two
senior executives who led Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s push into
high-risk, high-yield junk bonds in the 1980s -- resigned two
months after being relieved of their management duties.

   Their departures follow recent shakeups at several other
Wall Street securities firms amid the collapse of the $200
billion public junk-bond market. The junk-department heads at
First Boston Corp. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. have
been reassigned. Two senior managing directors in Bear
Stearns Cos.' junk-sales department quit this past week, and
PaineWebber Group Inc. is expected shortly to integrate its
junk department into the rest of the firm's bond sales and
trading division.
   In their heyday, Messrs. Minella and Berenson made
millions of dollars for Merrill, and for themselves, as
Merrill tried to dethrone junk-bond king Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. But their stars faded with the collapse of the
junk-bond market, which toppled Drexel into bankruptcy-law
proceedings and forced Merrill to rethink its commitment to
junk.
   The two "were part of something big and exciting, but the
world's changed over the last year," said Barry S. Friedberg,
Merrill's head of investment banking, in an interview.
   The changes in the market "necessitated quite a different
role for them in the firm, and we understand why they would
use this opportunity to attempt to do something else," Mr.
Friedberg said.
   Mr. Minella, 41 years old, and Mr. Berenson, 40, would
have left immediately after their duties were cut in June,
say people familiar with their plans. But the two men stayed
to finish their last major project for Merrill: the vast $6.9
billion refinancing package for RJR Nabisco Inc., which is
needed to retire many troublesome junk bonds that were issued
as part of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s record $26 billion
buy-out of the company in February 1989.
   In an interview, Mr. Minella said: "It would have been bad
for everyone to leave RJR in the lurch." He added that the
two wanted to leave on a high note, "like Ted Williams's last
at bat." (Mr. Williams hit a home run in his last at bat for
the Boston Red Sox.)
   For his part, KKR partner Henry Kravis said Messrs.
Minella and Berenson "did as professional a job as I have
ever seen on Wall Street." He called their work "diligent"
and "thorough."
   Messrs. Minella and Berenson -- who discussed their future
this past week while fishing near Mr. Minella's Jackson Hole,
Wyo., home -- both termed their long-term plans "uncertain."
But people with knowledge of their plans said they are
considering, among other things, starting a firm to invest in
restructuring over-leveraged companies.
   On Monday, the two men told their bosses they planned to
leave. Their resignations are effective Friday, Merrill said.
Both men were careful not to burn their bridges with Merrill;
the two men were once the firm's highest-paid executives,
earning a reported $5 million each in 1988. Said Mr. Berenson
in an interview: "I view it as a long and fruitful
association, but it's time to move on."
   After helping bankroll Wall Street in the late 1980s, junk
bonds have slowed to a virtual standstill. Just eight new
issues have been brought to market this year. Wall Street has
made just $16.2 million in junk-bond underwriting fees this
year, compared with $592.5 million through August of last
year, Securities Data Co. says.
   The merchant banking machinery that had been run by
Messrs. Minella and Berenson was absorbed into a new finance
and restructuring department run by Thomas Davis, 37, and
Nate Thorne, 36. Messrs. Davis and Thorne will take over as
co-chairmen of Merrill's merchant banking commitment
committee, posts that had been held by Messrs. Minella and
Berenson.
   Merrill has pared its junk-bond inventory to below $350
million; takeover-related "bridge" loans to corporate clients
have been slashed to about $185 million from $530 million in
June; that takes into account the expected payment soon of a
$230 million loan to Caterair International, formerly
Marriott Corp.'s airline catering division.
   Merrill says it doesn't rule out "additional commitments"
in bridge loans, but only those that are relatively small and
to existing clients.
