   THE CALL OF RESERVES to the Middle East poses puzzling
problems for the IRS.
   Officials are mobilizing to answer thorny issues raised by
the call-up, and may decide to distribute formal guidance.
Many of the questions involve benefit plans, which the IRS
oversees. For example, if a firm stops paying an employee's
salary while he's on reserve duty, can it stop contributing
to his defined benefit retirement plan? And can firms that
wish to continue contributing count the reservist's military
salary in figuring contribution limits?

   Also, does being sent to Saudi Arabia constitute a
hardship -- especially if the employee's private sector
salary is suspended -- in order to qualify for a distribution
from a 401K retirement plan? Most of these benefits
provisions weren't around the last time reserves were called
up, IRS officials note.
   A 1984 law exempts from federal income tax families of
government employees wounded or killed in a "terroristic or
military action" from the year before they were injured until
death.
                                                                                                       

   BACK HOME, OIL PRICE rises make tax debate more slippery
than ever.
   With the cost of oil soaring, some Southwestern lawmakers,
like Sen. Boren of Oklahoma, want to push oil-drilling tax
incentives. Finance Committee chairman Bentsen of Texas, a
longtime supporter of incentives, could be an important ally.
So will President Bush, a Texan and former oil man, who had
already included a drilling-incentives package in his fiscal
1991 budget.
   Up in the Northwest, however, Sen. Packwood of Oregon
wants to punish Big Oil. He's planning to propose reinstating
a "windfall-profits tax" on oil companies, taxing firms up to
70% on "excessive profits" from sales of domestic and foreign
oil. With the worry over oil prices, an energy tax on
consumers, looked at closely by budget negotiators before the
crisis, now seems unlikely. Some think the securities
transfer tax proposal could be another casualty, if the stock
market continues its recent decline.
                                                                                                       

   AS IF REAL ESTATE weren't a plagued industry already . . .
   Developers are irate at IRS plans to revoke a procedure
allowing them to include the projected costs of finishing
roads and other improvements in determining their profit on
subdivision sales. Developers are often contractually
obligated to make such improvements, and the change means
their taxable profit will be higher. "It would result in
taxpayers paying tax on more than their economic gain,"
insists Ken Kies, who represents the American Resort and
Residential Development Association.
   Battered by high interest rates, softening markets and a
credit squeeze, industry executives say the tax change
couldn't have come at a worse time. Sens. Pryor and Symms
sympathize and plan to introduce legislation restoring the
revenue procedure, which has been in effect for 15 years.
   Meanwhile, Arthur Andersen's Ivan Faggen says developers
are in limbo because IRS hasn't issued guidance on how they
should now allocate the costs.
                                                                                                       

   IMPROVED PROCESSING of individual tax returns cut IRS
interest payments on refunds almost in half this year. The
interest tab on refunds for returns not processed in 45 days
came to $4.7 million in 1990. In 1989 it was $8.2 million.
                                                                                                       

   AN ALCOHOLIC who didn't file tax returns for 27 years
isn't liable for fraud penalties, the Tax Court rules. Judge
Raum says he found no convincing evidence that Thomas
Chandler's failure to file from 1957 through 1983 was due to
fraud rather than health problems.
                                                                                                       

   BOND INVESTORS are relieved by IRS decision to exempt
Swiss and German bonds from a rule requiring that debt be
registered in the name of the owner. Registration allows
authorities to know who's getting the interest income. But
the Swiss and German markets don't issue registered debt.
Those capital markets would have been closed to American
investors had the agency not granted the exemption.
                                                                                                       

   AN INSURANCE INDUSTRY proposal takes on a life of its own.
   Seeking repeal of a law that taxes mutual insurance
companies based on the profits of their stock-based rivals,
the mutuals suggested requiring all insurance firms to
amortize agent commissions and other acquisition costs. That
would provide a fairer taxable basis, they say. But members
of Congress see new revenue potential in the so-called
deferred acquisition costs (DACs) idea, and may put it in a
1991 budget package without the repeal measure.
   That miffs the mutuals. "We'd very much like to see it
connected to repeal," says John Jonas, a lobbyist for the
mutuals. Rep. Moody, who introduced the bill, isn't happy
either, but an aide says, "I'd be surprised not to see DACs
by themselves in a tax bill." Moody's proposal calls for
amortizing 50% of the cost of commissions over seven years,
and lawmakers see potential for more revenue if that formula
were changed.
   Stock insurance firms hate the proposal in any form, says
William Harman, a lobbyist for those firms.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: A New Jersey bumper sticker reads "Florio and
Taxes: Perfect Together." . . . A weekend outing put on by
Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering is taxable to the lawyers
attending, so the firm will pay associates so they can pay
taxes on it. But since the firm's payment is income too, it
will toss in enough extra money to cover taxes on that amount
as well.
