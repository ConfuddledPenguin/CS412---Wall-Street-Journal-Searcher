   Tree Chemicals May
   Help Root Out Oil

   CERTAIN CHEMICALS in trees may slash the cost of
recovering untapped oil from the ground.
   Texaco researchers say tree chemicals known as lignins can
be converted into "surfactants" to flush oil from hard-to-get
pockets in oil reservoirs. Surfactants used in chemical
flooding are similar to household detergents that attach
themselves to oil.
   Petroleum-based surfactants currently used are economical
only when oil costs $35 or more a barrel, says Douglas Naae,
one of the researchers. But lignin-derived surfactants are
40% cheaper and would be economical with oil as low as $25,
he says. (West Texas intermediate crude traded yesterday at
$27.90.)
   Lignins, a plentiful byproduct of the paper industry, are
usually burned to generate energy for that industry. The
Texaco researchers say they've developed two types of
chemicals from lignins for use in oil recovery. One combines
lignins with a nitrogen-containing chemical produced from
animal tallow; the other is made by having lignins react with
hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
   The researchers say more than 300 billion barrels of crude
oil in the U.S., or more than 100 years of domestic supply,
could be extracted if economical methods were developed for
their recovery. About half of this could be recovered using
lignins, they say.
                                                                                                       

   Rain Stops the Radon --
   But Only Temporarily
                                                                                                       

   RAIN CAN sharply increase the level of indoor radon,
according to a study.
   A group of researchers from George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va., found that moisture can be the biggest
determinant of the radon level in a house. The moisture traps
radon in the soil, so the radioactive gas accumulates below
the house. When the moisture evaporates, the soil releases
the gas in heavy concentrations. The higher the saturation of
moisture in the ground, the heavier the subsequent emission
of radon.
   Douglas Mose, one of the researchers, says the findings
cast doubt on the validity of federal and state guidelines
for taking radon measurements. He says the guidelines advise
homeowners and potential home buyers who want to check radon
levels in the summer to close the windows of the house
beforehand. The assumption is that radon levels are higher in
winter than in summer, when windows are often open.
   But the readings may also be skewed by the level of
precipitation, Mr. Mose says. To be meaningful, he says, the
measurements should be taken in times of relatively normal
weather.
   Mr. Mose and George Mushrush, both at the university's
Center of Basic and Applied Science, took radon measurements
in 1,500 homes in northern Virginia and southern Maryland in
the summers of 1987 and 1988. In 1987, when rainfall was low,
radon levels in the basements of the homes averaged three
picoCuries per liter of air; the next summer, when rainfall
had been heavier, the average was four picoCuries.
   Mr. Mose says a similar pattern was found in winter. Under
federal health standards, a level below four picoCuries is
considered safe. Radon gas, the result of soil radiation,
irritates the lungs as it decays and has been associated with
lung cancer.
                                                                                                       

   Electronic Circuits
   Made Quick 'n' Easy
                                                                                                       

   PRODUCTION of microelectronic circuits is simplified by a
new polymer.
   A group of researchers at the University of California,
Berkeley, says it has developed a plastic film on which tiny
circuits can be printed directly. Now, circuits are etched on
silicon wafers, a process involving six to 10 steps.
   "The polymer does away with this laborious process," says
Bruce Novak, one of the researchers. When a laser beam hits
the polymer, the lines it draws become permanently conducting
circuit "wires," leaving unexposed areas as insulators.
   Mr. Novak says the polymer was developed by modifying the
chemical structure of an existing polymer. He says it was the
first time a polymer has been made electrically conductive by
light. Previously, that had been done only chemically, he
says. "Polymers have been thought of as only insulating and
encapsulating materials, but a new class of polymers is
emerging," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Getting Fish to Spawn
   In Captive Waters
                                                                                                       

   RESEARCHERS have developed hormonelike compounds that
stimulate fish to spawn in captivity.
   Though fish farming is growing rapidly, several
commercially important species have been left out because
they don't spawn in captivity or do so unpredictably. Without
proper water depth, temperature, salinity and other factors
from the wild, the pituitary gland doesn't release
gonadotropin, the main hormone controlling the development of
eggs.
   Yonathan Zohar of Israel's National Center for Mariculture
and Robert Langer of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology recently synthesized "analogs" of a compound that
triggers the release of gonadotropin. The analogs resist
kidney and liver degradation, they say, in contrast to
injected gonadotropin.
   When the analogs were first used, however, they were only
partly effective. So, the researchers developed time-release
systems: The analogs are either molded into tiny spheres to
be injected into the fish, or packaged in small biodegradable
polymer rods or disks that are inserted under the fish's
skin.
   The method has induced spawning in Atlantic and Pacific
salmon, rainbow trout, sea bream, sea bass and gray mullet.
The researchers say the technique could also be used to
induce out-of-season spawning.
