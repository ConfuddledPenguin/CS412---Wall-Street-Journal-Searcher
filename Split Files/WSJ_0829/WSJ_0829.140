   LOS ANGELES -- Michael S. Moers, former chairman and
co-owner of the now-defunct Brookside Savings &amp; Loan
Association, pleaded guilty in federal court here to four
felony counts related to criminal conduct at Brookside and
another defunct thrift.
   Brookside Savings and the other thrift, Westwood Savings &amp;
Loan Association, both in Los Angeles, were taken over by
federal regulators in 1989 and 1986, respectively. They are
among the many failed thrifts being investigated by the
Department of Justice and the Office of Thrift Supervision.

   Mr. Moers, 39 years old, was recently charged by the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles with selling his interests
in two properties to the thrifts and concealing his ownership
from regulators. The attorney's office said Mr. Moers also
secretly received consulting fees from Westwood Savings.
   The four charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison and a $265,000 fine. Mr. Moers will be sentenced Dec.
10, said Steven Zipperstein, an assistant U.S. attorney who
handled the case.
