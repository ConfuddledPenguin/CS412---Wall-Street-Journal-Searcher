   National Intergroup Inc. said it extended until Sept. 4
its tender offer for the cumulative convertible preference
units representing limited partnership interests of Permian
Partners L.P., an oil partnership controlled by National
Intergroup.
   The offer, at $3.85 plus one non-transferable contingent
value right per preference unit, was to expire at midnight
Aug. 27.

   National Intergroup, based in Pittsburgh, said that as of
Aug. 27, holders had tendered 5,535,680 preference units.
However, the number tendered fell far short of the 7,875,001
units, a majority of the publicly held units, the company had
specified as the minimum required to make the offer
effective.
   National Intergroup is primarily drug wholesaler, but it
has interests in metals, general merchandising and oil
production. The board recently agreed to consider sale of the
drug unit, FoxMeyer Corp., or the entire company.
