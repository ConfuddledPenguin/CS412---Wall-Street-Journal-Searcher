   LONDON -- A former chairman of Guinness PLC was sentenced
to five years in prison for what the judge called "dishonesty
on a massive scale" in the biggest British financial scandal
of the 1980s.
   By British standards, the sentences given to Ernest
Saunders, 55 years old, and two of his co-defendants were
unusually stiff and signaled tougher policing of London's
financial community, legal specialists said. The trial judge,
Justice Sir Denis Henry, said the sentence sends "a clear
message that those who seek commercial advantage by acting
dishonestly can expect little leniency from the court."

   The sentencing of Mr. Saunders and the two others closed a
chapter in the longest-running British financial scandal of
the 1980s. The case, with its three-year investigation and
113-day trial, helped prompt new laws to regulate practices
in British boardrooms and brokerage houses.
   Mr. Saunders' crime, according to the verdict Monday,
occurred during the British spirits company's #2.53 billion
($4.92 billion) takeover in 1986 of Scottish rival Distillers
Co. To win the takeover battle, Mr. Saunders allegedly
conspired to inflate his company's stock price. Prosecutors
said he authorized payments to three co-defendants, one of
whom bought #25 million worth of Guinness stock. Supporting
the stock's price was important to Guinness's takeover
victory because the value of its offer for Distillers was
tied to the price of Guinness's shares.
   During yesterday's sentencing, one of the defendants,
Anthony Parnes, a 45-year-old stockbroker, collapsed. But he
later returned to the dock to hear himself sentenced to 2 1/2
years in prison and ordered to pay #440,000 in court costs.
   Prosecutors said Mr. Parnes had received #3.4 million in
"success" fees from Guinness for his help in the
stock-support scheme. He has already repaid about #2 million
to Guinness.
   A third defendant, Gerald Ronson, 50, chairman of Heron
International PLC, was sentenced to one year in prison, fined
#5 million and ordered to pay #440,000 in court costs.
   Companies controlled by Mr. Ronson, the jury found,
received #5.8 million for help in supporting Guinness stock.
But after the scandal broke Mr. Ronson repaid most of the
money.
   A fourth defendant, financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, is
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 25. Sir Jack, the jury found,
illegally received a #3 million fee for his help in the
takeover battle. A second trial is expected to begin this
autumn of Mr. Saunders and three other defendants on other
charges arising from the Guinness affair.
   In London's financial district, one brokerage house
chairman, who declined to be named, called the penalties
"very severe" and said they represent "a dramatic change of
{police} tactics in the City." Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of
the Stock Exchange, called the case "a salutary and highly
visible warning of the innate risks in activity of this
kind." But he added that he doesn't think the Guinness
defendants' conduct "is or ever was widespread" in the City.
   Justice Henry, on the other hand, called the crimes an
outgrowth of the competitive, aggressive atmosphere of the
British mergers and acquisitions game during the 1980s bull
market. He called Mr. Saunders "at the center of the
dishonest conduct that occurred" at Guinness. While Mr.
Saunders didn't invent the illegal stock-support scheme, the
judge said, it couldn't have occurred without his "knowledge
and approval."
   "When men are hell-bent for victory, greed is in the
saddle, and ordinary probity and the law are thrust aside,"
the judge said.
   Mr. Saunders, who says he is impoverished and on legal
aid, stood silently as the judge passed sentence. Mr.
Saunders' defense had been that the payments he authorized to
his co-defendants were normal business expenses during a
takeover. His son says he will appeal.
