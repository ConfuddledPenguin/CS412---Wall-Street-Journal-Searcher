   NILES, Ohio -- RMI Titanium Co. said directors authorized
the purchase of as much as $10 million of its common stock.
The titanium products concern has 15.1 million shares
outstanding.
   At its current price, the buy-back would represent a total
of about 1.2 million shares, or 8% of the common outstanding.
RMI shares closed at $8.25, down 12.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock has
traded as high as $13 since the company went public last
April 20.

   While product orders have declined recently, "This
wouldn't appear to justify our stock price decline," L.
Frederick Gieg Jr., president and chief executive officer,
said. Because of a large backlog of orders for commercial
aircraft, he said, "We feel RMI's titanium mill product
shipments in 1991 will approach the levels of 1990."
