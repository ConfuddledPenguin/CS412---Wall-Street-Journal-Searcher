   The company said its wholesale activities declined, but it
posted a 17% increase in retail-store sales for the quarter.
   Abe Oberlin, chairman and president of the women's apparel
retailer and manufacturer, attributed the results to an
expanded product line and to cost-cutting efforts to simplify
manufacturing operations, slash inventories and dispose of
excess plant and equipment.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Aileen shares rose 12.5 cents to $2.75.
