   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is poised
once again to use Japanese help to bolster its product line.
   The telecommunications giant, which doesn't make portable
computers or hand-held cellular phone gear, is talking to
Japan's Marubeni Corp. about joint product development.

   An AT&amp;T spokesman said the two companies are holding talks
"focused on innovative solutions," including development of a
laptop computer that can communicate via wireless
transmission such as cellular radio.
   The AT&amp;T spokesman said Marubeni, acting as a broker,
could also bring in other Japanese parties, including a major
manufacturer to provide electronic parts and production
support. In Tokyo, a Marubeni spokesman said Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. may fill that role. But he said that
such matters as the exact form of the joint effort and the
production site have yet to be decided.
   Steve J. Lair, a vice president and analyst at Dataquest
Inc., noted that the laptop field is crowded with U.S. and
Asian manufacturers, including Taiwanese suppliers that are
readying laptop computers with built-in radio communications
devices and facsimile machines.
   "I don't see anything particularly unique about AT&amp;T's
participation in the laptop market other than its strength in
communications," he said.
   AT&amp;T's attraction to the market isn't surprising. Mr. Lair
estimated that the laptop market in the U.S. is currently a
$4.5 billion business, growing more than 10% annually.
Moreover, the market for notebook-sized computers of less
than six pounds will grow more than 100% a year between now
and 1994, he said.
   The discussions between AT&amp;T Computer Systems and
Marubeni, Japan's fourth-largest trading company, come on the
heels of numerous joint ventures between AT&amp;T and Japanese
companies such as NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. in
micro-electronic components and Ricoh Co. in business
telephone systems.
   A joint R&amp;D effort would alleviate some cost pressures at
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, which handles development for AT&amp;T
Computer Systems and so far has managed to avoid the deep
cutbacks experienced by other AT&amp;T units.
