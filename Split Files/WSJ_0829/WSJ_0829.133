   Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net
income rose 50%, largely on strong footwear sales.
   The New York-based apparel maker said net in the quarter
ended July 29 grew to $5.7 million, or 37 cents a share, from
$3.8 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period. Sales increased 15% to $191.1 million from $166.4
million.

   Lawrence S. Phillips, chairman, attributed the improvement
to gains in footwear and shirt sales, but he said the sweater
business remained "quite soft."
   He projected "significant" profit improvement in the
fourth quarter, saying he expects advertising expenses as
well as pressures on cash flow and inventory to be less
severe than they were during last year's holiday season.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Phillips-Van Heusen shares rose $1.25 to $18.
