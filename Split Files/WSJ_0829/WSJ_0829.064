   TOKYO -- Maintaining a steady trend upward, sales at
Japan's department stores and other major retail stores in
July rose 9% from a year earlier to 2.059 trillion yen
($14.29 billion), the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said.
   Though the pace of growth slowed from rises of 11.9% in
June and 10.4% in May, ministry officials said the latest
statistics indicate Japan's personal consumption remains
strong and continues to support economic growth.
