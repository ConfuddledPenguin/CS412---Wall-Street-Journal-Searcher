   BRUSSELS -- Acec-Union-Miniere, a Belgian nonferrous
metals and mining unit of Societe Generale de Belgique, said
it and a Mexican partner bought the Cananea copper mine from
the Mexican government for $475 million.
   A spokesman said the purchase is Acec's first venture in
South America. Acec holds slightly more than 21% of the mine,
which was bought through a joint venture, Mexicana de Cananea
S.A., formed with a mining affiliate of Grupo Mexico. Acec
has spent $85 million on the mine; Grupo Mexico, which holds
the remaining 79%, has spent $390 million.

   The venture also is investing $30 million in expanding
Cananea output, now 150,000 tons of copper a year, which the
spokesman said the company hopes to increase to 250,000 tons.
