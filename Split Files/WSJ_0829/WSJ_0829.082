   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit inched up
across the board, reflecting recent increases in interest
rates.
   The average yield on a small-denomination six-month CD,
for instance, rose to 7.40%, from 7.37%, in the week ended
yesterday, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an
information service. On a small-denomination one-year CD, the
average yield rose to 7.55% from 7.52%, Banxquote said.

   But the outlook is uncertain, said Norberto Mehl,
Banxquote chairman. "It's hard to predict until the Persian
Gulf crisis is settled," he said. Interest rates had been
declining steadily for several months before Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait and the resulting jump in oil prices.
   All the increases in CD yields in the latest week were
just a fraction of a percentage point. The biggest increases
were on long-term large-denomination and broker-sold CDs. The
average yield on five-year CDs sold by major brokerage firms
rose to 8.62% from 8.53%, according to Banxquote. Five-year
"jumbo" CDs sold directly by major banks, generally in
denominations of $90,000 and more, posted an average yield of
8.27%, up from 8.19%.
   The only decline in yields was on small money market
deposit accounts. The average at the 18 major banks surveyed
by Banxquote fell to 6.44% from 6.46%. The average yield on
"jumbo" money market deposits remained at 6.89%.
