   Doug Bandow was right to criticize the concepts of
ecoterrorism currently espoused by Earth First] (editorial
page, June 20) and other irresponsible people. Such
ecoterrorism or "monkeywrenching" must be denounced by true
environmentalists, including those of us who use and produce
forest products.
   I object strenuously, however, to Mr. Bandow's description
of "government-subsidized timbering, which is both
environmentally destructive and wasteful."

<TEXT>
   I earn my living producing forest products. Much of the
timber resource is purchased from state or federal forests.
When properly managed, such renewable resources are grown and
harvested as a cyclical crop that benefits wildlife,
recreation, hunters, the atmosphere and the watershed. Using
public timber resources in this way doesn't strike me as
wasteful and, if properly managed for multiple-use
objectives, it is not subsidized.
   Readers of The Wall Street Journal, which is itself a
forest product, deserve to understand the newsprint upon
which it is printed comes from trees -- an environmentally
friendly, wholly renewable resource.
