   Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines spends a lot of money at the
fuel dock. But even though petroleum prices have soared to
their highest levels in five years, all is calm at the
company's Miami headquarters.
   That's because of a risk-management tool called a
commodity swap. Months before Iraq overran Kuwait, Royal
Caribbean used the tool to hedge against price increases for
much of its fuel needs this year and beyond. This year, the
swap entitles the company to pay $18.41 a barrel for oil.
That will save Royal Caribbean about $10 a barrel over the
current price every time it fills one of its 750,000-gallon
shipboard fuel tanks.

   Despite the obvious benefits of hedging in times like
these, companies that hedge their oil needs are a minority.
Scores of corporations and other big fuel users have had to
admit they were caught off guard by the oil run-up. Now they
are paying fuel bills that are as much as 35% higher than a
month ago.
   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, for instance, estimates its
fuel bill this year will be more than $300 million higher
than last year. The Postal Service expects an extra $45
million in costs through the end of this year. The Los
Angeles mass transit system fears it hasn't allocated enough
money to fuel its buses. Meanwhile, truckers and railroads
are imposing fuel surcharges, and utilities are seeking rate
increases.
   Much of this turmoil could have been avoided. Corporations
dependent on a commodity such as oil can lock in prices and
protect themselves from price swings. The strategies range
from using futures and options contracts traded at major
exchanges to forward contracts and so-called swap
transactions. All of these hedging strategies amount to
pretty much the same thing -- hog and soybean farmers have
done it for years.
   The purpose of hedging isn't to minimize cost but to
minimize risk. Hedgers often end up paying more for a
commodity when prices are low, but they are not as badly
stung when prices jump. Hedging allows them to predict and
manage their future costs better. This makes business
planning more reliable, which is especially important for
companies that carry a lot of debt because it helps ensure
that they will be able to meet interest obligations.
   A buyer of crude oil who wants to guard against rising
prices, for instance, would buy futures at current prices if
he thought them satisfactory. The futures contracts represent
an obligation to buy a specified quantity of a commodity such
as crude oil or heating oil, at an agreed-upon price by a
certain date. If prices later rise, the added oil expense
will be offset by a profit in the futures market. If prices
fall, the loss incurred on the futures will be offset by the
benefit of lower oil prices.
   Hedging is also done in what is called the swaps market.
In a swap agreement, an oil user or producer agrees to lock
in the price it will pay or receive at a predictable level.
This is typically done through a bank or a hedging manager.
   By using commodity swaps, Royal Caribbean estimates it
will save $2 million on fuel costs for the rest of 1990. The
cruise line, which first began trying to manage its oil costs
last year, says it now has swap hedges in place to lock 40%
of its fuel costs through 1991. It will pay $18.41 a barrel
for fuel through 1990 and $19.65 a barrel in 1991. The 1991
hedge, which covers the equivalent of about 500,000 barrels
of crude oil, would save the company an estimated $4.1
million at today's fuel prices.
   CSX Corp., a national freight company, also hedges
routinely to protect the 850 million gallons of fuel it needs
annually to run its trains and barges. The company has been
hedging for three years, using everything from swap
arrangements to options and futures contract trades, says a
company spokesman. When Iraq attacked Kuwait, some of the
fuel CSX will need through 1990 was hedged with a strategy
known as options participation, using call options on crude
oil contracts that entitle the holder to buy the oil for a
specified price over a specified period.
   CSX bought its contracts when the price of fuel was
relatively low. Now, because of the oil-price run-up, they're
worth much more than CSX paid for them. For example, a call
contract that gives its owner the right to buy crude at $20 a
barrel and sold for about a $1 a barrel two months ago would
be worth over $9 a barrel.
   Since the invasion, CSX has been selling off some of its
call contracts for a profit, which it then uses to reduce the
pain of paying more for fuel. It still holds some options and
futures contracts, though it won't specify what kind or how
many.
   The costs of hedging vary widely depending upon the
technique. Commodity swaps, often arranged by banks, don't
require the payment of any premium at all; the bank typically
pairs a fuel producer and a fuel user who both want to swap,
and collects a differential between what the producer
receives and the user pays for oil.
   To trade options or futures contracts, companies must set
aside capital and pay commissions. But these instruments
allow the buyer to leverage its control of a commodity. For
instance, for an up-front margin investment of about $6,000,
a company on July 20 could have bought three September
heating-oil futures contracts (42,000 gallons each) on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, then valued at $71,631. On Aug.
20, the buyer could have sold those contracts at a profit of
$32,899.
   Most companies manage their hedging with tiny staffs. At
Cenex Inc., an oil refining division of Land O' Lakes Inc.,
David Zanussi runs a two-man department that manages all of
the company's hedging positions in options and futures, as
well as commodity swaps and forward contracts, an agreement
to purchase or sell fuel at a given price over a period of
time.
   The uncertainty since the Mideast crisis began Aug. 2 has
raised the costs of some hedging techniques. On Aug. 1, an
option on an October crude-oil contract with an exercise
price near what was then the price of oil ($22) cost 92 cents
a barrel. By Aug. 10, an option on the October crude contract
near its then current price ($26) cost $1.83 -- nearly double
the pre-invasion level. Margin requirements on oil futures
contracts have also risen sharply since the invasion.
   Even when the costs of hedging were lower, many companies
were reluctant to even try it. Despite their huge dependence
on jet fuel, for instance, few U.S. airlines have made
serious efforts to hedge. (Many of their European rivals use
hedging techniques routinely.) USAir Group Inc. and NWA
Inc.'s Northwest Airlines both say they have experimented
with hedging; other carriers, such as American Air, say they
don't hedge at all.
   U.S. airlines have been reluctant to hedge partly because
they still view commodities markets as something just short
of gambling houses. "I don't want to tell my board we have a
big payout to make {on hedging positions} because I guessed
wrong on the direction of oil prices," says the comptroller
of one U.S. airline.
   Airlines also apparently feel there is safety in numbers:
If no carrier hedges, the whole industry is affected in the
same way, whether oil prices decline or fall. That way, the
industry is also more likely to move in lock-step in
attempting to pass cost increases on to consumers in the form
of higher fares.
   But carriers with large debt loads are under increased
pressure to manage their finances with as much predictability
as possible. Last year, Northwest Airlines saved more than $7
million in fuel costs because it hedged 4.2 million gallons
of its fuel purchases for each month. Because Northwest buys
more than five million gallons a day, that was a drop in the
bucket. But the airline still found the experiment
encouraging.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has sparked a lot of interest in
hedging, most immediately among oil producers. Volume on the
New York Merc, where a number of petroleum-related contracts
are traded, has jumped in the past three weeks. Average daily
volume for petroleum futures at the New York Merc rose to
203,336 contracts during the week ended Aug. 10, up 42% from
the average level from January through July. Trading in
options contracts has also surged.
   "A lot of companies have to get burned badly at least once
to understand why they need to hedge," says Chris Swanson, a
trader for Phibro Energy Inc., a division of Salomon Inc.
that devises hedging programs for industrial oil buyers and
sellers.
   One new convert is Burlington Motor Carriers Inc., which
considered hedging its fuel purchases a few months ago but
didn't take action. When Saddam Hussein's troops stormed
Kuwait, Richard M. Rogan, Burlington's president, called
Ralph Arnold, a senior vice president, and said, "Ralph, I
really wish we'd put on that hedge." The two agreed that they
had no choice but to ask customers to pay a fuel surcharge --
and they vowed to get more serious about hedging.
   Many companies that sell petroleum also are now rushing
into the market. "A lot of producers are eager to lock in the
higher prices," says David Hammer, vice president of Phibro.
"It's mostly been independent oil companies that produce
anywhere from 1,000 barrels a day to 100,000 barrels a day,"
he says. One Texas oil and gas producer with annual sales of
more than $1 billion hedged 20% of its oil production until
the end of 1990 within two hours after the market opened on
the morning after the invasion. Said a spokeswoman: "We saw
the oil market in a panic and we thought it an overreaction."
   Some companies that hedge say that, as fuel buyers, the
wake of the price run-up may not be the best time to lock in
prices. But others say that if prices seem to be at a
plateau, they would consider hedging against further rises.
   Executives at MGM Grand Air, a luxury airline service,
were kicking themselves because they only recently decided
not to hedge fuel purchases. "If we had done it a month ago,
we'd be in great shape now," says Charles Demoney, chief
executive.
