   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
effectively told state-chartered savings and loan
associations that they can't withdraw from the Federal Home
Loan Bank System for at least 18 months, insuring that the
thrifts will continue contributing to the cost of the S&amp;L
bailout.
   Some government officials feared that the FDIC would allow
the thrifts to pull out and that such a decision could lead
to an exodus from the home loan banks and hurt the system's
ability to help pay for the bailout.

   The FDIC action came on a request from a small Wisconsin
thrift, Wauwatosa Savings &amp; Loan Association, which asked the
FDIC if it could maintain its federal deposit insurance if it
pulled out of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.
   The FDIC, in a closed board meeting yesterday, decided to
tell Wauwatosa Savings that if the thrift left the system,
the FDIC could "make no assurances" that the thrift could
maintain its insurance, agency officials said.
   However, the FDIC's board voted to postpone a final
decision for 18 months to consider the issue in conjunction
with other regulators, including the Office of Thrift
Supervision. FDIC officials said the OTS intends to propose a
regulation that state-chartered thrifts must belong to the
Federal Home Loan Bank System.
   Last year's S&amp;L bailout law made it clear that federally
chartered thrifts must maintain their membership but left the
status of state-chartered thrifts unclear. The home loan
banks are required to contribute as much as $300 million a
year to the bailout, and some thrifts have complained that
those and other costs have made membership unattractive.
   Members must own stock in the home loan banks and receive
dividends on that stock. In addition, all banks and thrifts
must pay premiums for deposit insurance coverage.
   But Treasury Department officials warned the FDIC that if
the agency let the thrifts go, it could become difficult for
the home loan banks to meet their required contribution to
the bailout. Some important members of Congress, such as
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas),
also were concerned that a flight of thrifts from the system
would cripple the affordable-housing programs the home loan
banks must pay for under the bailout law.
   Officials of Wauwatosa Savings couldn't be reached for
comment last night.
