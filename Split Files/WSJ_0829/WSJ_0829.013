   THIBODAUX, La. -- Sometimes Sen. Bennett Johnston can't
contain himself anymore. Sometimes he just can't keep from
talking about his chief Republican opponent, David Duke.
   "The forces of lightness and darkness are so juxtaposed,"
the three-term conservative Democrat blurts out at the end of
his sleepy stump speech here. "I may not be much," he says,
"but the other side is pretty bad."

   Mr. Duke is certainly no ordinary adversary. A former
grand wizard of the Knights of Ku Klux Klan and founder of
the National Association for the Advancement of White People,
the telegenic young state legislator probably commands a
quarter of the vote in the state -- and maybe more.
   Sen. Johnston is clearly torn about how to deal with Mr.
Duke. He wants to avoid lending credibility and recognition
to him by attacking him by name. On the other hand,
disclosing facts about Mr. Duke's extremist activities could
well be the only effective way to defuse what some here see
as the most potent populist movement in the state since Huey
Long.
   "It's risky either way," says Paul Lewis, a
political-science professor at Tulane University.
   No one thinks the 40-year-old Mr. Duke will defeat Sen.
Johnston, at 58 one of the Senate's most powerful members, in
the Oct. 6 open primary. The issue is whether Mr. Duke can
finish second while he and state Sen. Ben Bagert, the other,
lesser-known Republican candidate, hold Sen. Johnston to less
than 50% of the vote. That would set up a Johnston-Duke race
in November -- and raise the challenger's political profile
to national scope.
   "This race," Sen. Johnston concludes, "is about the
legitimization of David Duke."
   In most public appearances and in his television
commercials, Sen. Johnston all but ignores Mr. Duke. Like
many incumbents, Sen. Johnston and his backers assert that
his seniority wins many benefits -- jobs in particular -- for
the folks back home.
   Sometimes, though, Mr. Johnston deviates from this
kid-glove strategy to disparage his rival, at least
indirectly. In his basic stump speech, for example, he talks
obliquely about his "crusade" for "unity" and "opportunity,"
and warns that businesses will shun the state if it votes
wrong in this race.
   In interviews, Sen. Johnston can be more blunt. Mr. Duke
has "a very dangerous message for the United States," he
says. "His campaign is Johnny one-note, it's all about race."
Nazism, Mr. Johnston adds, "is the lens through which you can
interpret his whole life."
   In a state famous for colorful politicians and spicy food,
Sen. Johnston is as bland as oatmeal. To enliven his
appearances, he campaigns for a while alongside the Cajun
firecracker of Louisiana politics these days, John Breaux,
the junior senator. At Avery Island, Sen. Johnston is
presented with a gallon of Tabasco sauce. "It's a six-month
supply," he exclaims. "A six-week supply," Sen. Breaux
quickly corrects him.
   The sandy-haired, handsome Mr. Duke could hardly be less
like Sen. Johnston. As soft-spoken and well-spoken in person
and on television as he is electrifying in front of a crowd,
Mr. Duke has attracted an energetic and loyal following.
   "We just love him; we're almost like groupies," says Betty
Whitehead, a retired Shreveport schoolteacher at a Duke rally
in Mansfield. Adds Frank Wamble, another Shreveport
supporter: "He says what we're all scared to death to say."
   Mr. Duke's message is geared to appeal to the economically
frustrated, a category of people who are numerous in this
long-depressed state. He rages against government and what he
characterizes as its elitist insiders like Sen. Johnston. He
doesn't specifically talk about blacks or Jews, but glorifies
"Christian values" and takes special aim at
"affirmative-action programs" and "the welfare state" --
terms his enemies charge he uses as racist code words.
   Mr. Duke disclaims as youthful indiscretion much of his
past, including the time he wore a Nazi uniform at a college
demonstration. But evidence of his leanings linger. In a
taped interview with a student last November, he said he
believed that "nationality comes from genes," that whites
have higher IQs and that the U.S. shouldn't have entered
World War II.
   Just last year, Beth Rickey, a member of the state GOP
central committee, publicized her purchase of several
neo-Nazi books and videotapes from the book business Mr. Duke
runs out of his home. Of the 91 titles listed in a 1988
advertisement for the company in the NAAWP's newsletter, 25
appear to be about Jews, Hitler or Germany.
   Some of Mr. Duke's own pseudonymous writings also haunt
his campaign. There was "African Atto," a tome that purports
to be a street-fighting manual for black militants that Mr.
Duke wrote under the name Mohammed X in the early 1970s.
Using another alias, Mr. Duke also wrote "Finders-Keepers:
Finding and Keeping the Man You Want," a how-to manual
offering women tips on everything from how to dress
attractively to how to perform oral sex. "It was a little
racy," Mr. Duke concedes, quickly adding, "I'd better not use
that word."
   His own Republican Party has "excommunicated" him,
according to Wendy DeMocker, spokeswoman for the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee. "We will not speak to him,"
she says. "We will not take his phone calls. He is the
ultimate snake-oil salesman. He is attempting to fool people
with his disguised message."
   Still, Sen. Johnston is taking him seriously -- a tack
that is considered wise across the state. In St. Charles
Parish, 79-year-old Blanche Kugler hands the senator what she
calls a lucky bean to keep in his pocket. "He's going to need
it," she says. "Duke is getting up."
