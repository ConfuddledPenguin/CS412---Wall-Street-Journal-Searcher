   WASHINGTON -- The recent collapse of Stotler Group Inc.
has prompted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
consider new rules governing transfers of accounts within
futures firms, CFTC officials said.
   The Stotler case has raised questions over the regulation
of managed futures funds, which are like mutual funds
invested in the futures markets. An audit of Stotler Funds
Inc. three months ago by regulators revealed a questionable
$5.5 million transfer to Stotler Group, the firm's holding
company, of customer money that was supposed to be invested
in the futures market.

   But no action was taken against Stotler Funds until after
the cash-hungry parent defaulted on payments to one of the
funds and other lenders July 26. At that point, Stotler Funds
halted customer redemptions from the fund. The CFTC has since
charged that Stotler Funds violated antifraud laws by lending
the $5.5 million.
   Stotler Group was forced to seek bankruptcy-law protection
from its creditors this week after the commodity funds in
which the $5.5 million was invested forced the holding
company into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
   CFTC officials didn't elaborate on what kind of rules they
are considering.
   At a CFTC board meeting yesterday, officials also said
they planned to consider new rules governing the transfer of
customer accounts by futures firms that are on the verge of
failing.
   The agency wants to focus on rules for notifying affected
customers, documentation in connection with bulk transfers,
the effect of a futures firm's closing on guarantee
arrangements and requirements for notifying the CFTC.
   "Moving accounts from a firm as large as Stotler is a
Herculean task," Andrea Corcoran, head of the CFTC'S trading
and markets division, said during the meeting.
   The CFTC isn't alone in its quest to obtain more
information from the parent companies of brokerage firms. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing for passage of
a bill that would expand its authority to monitor the
financial situation of holding companies of securities firms.
   CFTC board members voted to approve the staff's plan to
proceed with the rule reviews, which are expected to result
in recommendations for new rules early next year. "This comes
at a very good time, while it {the Stotler collapse} is fresh
in our minds, to go back and search for the weakest link,"
Commissioner Kalo Hineman said.
   Separately, the CFTC approved a rule proposed by the
National Futures Association that will raise the minimum
capital requirement for futures firms to $250,000 from
$50,000.
   A CFTC official said the change probably won't affect
large futures firms but may affect some small "boutique"
firms that enter the futures business without a large amount
of capital.
