   The Japanese company said the acquisition would strengthen
Clarion's car stereo technology by introducing McIntosh
Laboratory's long-established, advanced technology. The
action also enables Clarion to enter the car audio business
by taking advantage of the McIntosh brand name.
   Clarion Shoji Co. (U.S.A.) will maintain McIntosh
Laboratory's current management staff and 246 employees after
the takeover.
   McIntosh Laboratory is a top U.S. audio equipment maker
established in 1946, well-known for its power amplifier,
preamplifier and speaker systems. Its product line includes
tuners, compact disc players, receivers and remote control
units.
   McIntosh had sales of $16.8 million in 1989, with pretax
profit of $2.6 million.
