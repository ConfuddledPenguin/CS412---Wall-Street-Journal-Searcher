   JENKINTOWN, Pa. -- Flagship Financial Corp. said its board
authorized the purchase of as many as 345,000, or about 10%,
of the thrift's shares outstanding, in transactions to begin
"in the near future" and continue for the next 12 months.
   Flagship said its current stock price doesn't adequately
reflect its long-term prospects, especially since the company
adopted a plan to reorganize its business.
