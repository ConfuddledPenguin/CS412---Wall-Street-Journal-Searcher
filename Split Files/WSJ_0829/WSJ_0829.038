   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America and Akzo, a
Netherlands-based chemical company, signed a memorandum of
understanding to cooperate in production and marketing of
fiber-metal laminates for the aerospace industry.
   Both companies have developed materials using alternating
layers of sheet metal and high-strength fiber-reinforced
resins. However, Alcoa uses aramid fibers, such as Du Pont
Co.'s Kevlar, while Akzo uses glass fibers, Alcoa said.

<TEXT>
   Alcoa, a major aluminum producer, would contribute its
expertise in use of aluminum alloys to the joint venture and
would have a majority interest in the joint venture, if a
final agreement is reached. Akzo would contribute its
knowledge of advanced fibers.
