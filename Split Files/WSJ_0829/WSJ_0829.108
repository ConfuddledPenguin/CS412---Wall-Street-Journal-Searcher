   Farah Inc., El Paso, Texas, said it sold its real estate
in the United Kingdom for about $13 million.
   The property has been the site of Farah's U.K. operation.
But, eager to reduce costs and take advantage of the
property's appreciated value, the clothing concern made plans
to move its operation elsewhere and put the property up for
sale.

   Farah said proceeds from the sale were used to retire $4.8
million of mortgage debt as well as to repay short-term bank
debt. Farah said it realized a pretax gain on the sale of
about $9 million.
   In the six months ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of
$2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.
