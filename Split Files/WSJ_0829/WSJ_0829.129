   Apache Corp. said it agreed to buy some oil properties
from a Consolidated Natural Gas Co. unit for $23.5 million in
cash.
   Denver-based Apache said the purchase includes 41 wells in
seven fields, from which Consolidated produces an average of
1,500 barrels of oil a day. The purchase also includes about
100,000 undeveloped acres. The properties are located in
Nevada, Wyoming, North Dakota and Montana.

   Apache, an oil exploration, development and production
concern, said the purchase "increases our exposure to the oil
market, complements our active drilling program and adds to
our confidence about growing our reserves again in 1990."
   The Consolidated unit, CNG Producing Co., said the sale
was in line with its plan to focus exploration activities in
the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast and the mid-continent
area. Pittsburgh-based Consolidated is a producer,
transporter and distributor of natural gas.
