   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit, measured
on a balance-of-payments basis, narrowed to $22.58 billion in
the second quarter, the smallest gap since the fourth quarter
of 1983, the Commerce Department reported.
   A $3.2 billion decline in petroleum imports, reflecting
falling oil prices, was the main reason for the narrowing
from a first-quarter deficit of $26.28 billion, the
department said. Imports other than oil grew $300 million.

   A 0.5% increase in exports, to $96.74 billion, also helped
shrink the gap. Imports declined 2.6% to $119.32 billion.
   Oil prices have since risen in the wake of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, and analysts expect the trade deficit to
widen in the third quarter as a result.
   The quarterly balance-of-payments measure of the
merchandise trade gap usually shows the same trends as the
more closely watched monthly report, which has also been
narrowing. The quarterly figure excludes military trade and
reflects certain adjustments for timing, insurance coverage
and valuation.
   All the numbers were adjusted for regular seasonal
fluctuations.
