   WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress gave President Bush
broad support for his handling so far of the military
confrontation with Iraq, but they came away from a White
House meeting unsure of how Mr. Bush plans to manage the
crisis in the future.
   Most lawmakers who spoke to reporters after the meeting
said they were uncertain how Mr. Bush plans to force Iraq to
end its occupation of Kuwait, how long the effort will take,
what goal Mr. Bush has beyond forcing an Iraqi withdrawal,
and how much of the cost of the operation will be borne by
America's allies.

   As Iraq sent mixed signals about its intentions toward
Western hostages while tightening its grip on Kuwait, Mr.
Bush opened a meeting with about 150 members of Congress by
saying, "We can only succeed if all of us, executive and
legislative, Republican and Democrat, work together."
According to the lawmakers, the president heard no firm
dissent from his policy during the session, which was closed
to the public after his initial remarks.
   Instead, members of Congress scrambled to offer support
for the administration's approach to the crisis, which has
strong backing in public opinion polls. Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), declared, "The one clear
message that comes from today's meeting was that the U.S.
Congress, and I believe the American people, are united in
support of the president's actions."
   But Sen. Mitchell, reflecting uncertainties about the
future, added that continued congressional support isn't
guaranteed. Asked if Congress has issued Mr. Bush "a blank
check," he said, "Of course not. Approval of past actions
isn't blanket approval of all future actions."
   One factor that could shape congressional attitudes in the
future could be the cost of the operation. The Pentagon
yesterday doubled, to $2.5 billion, its estimate of the tab
for the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia through the end
of September. It explained the increase by citing increased
fuel costs and expenses related to the reserve call-up.
   A number of members of Congress attending the meeting
asked questions about the cost, including its impact on the
economy and whether it will be shared by America's allies.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), a
Democratic leader who has been a frequent critic of the
president, said, "I think there was a tremendous amount of
support for the way he {Mr. Bush} has been operating."
   Rep. Gephardt said the president told the lawmakers that
Japan and European nations soon will announce significant
financial and military aid for the stop-Iraq effort, but the
Democratic lawmaker said he doubted the aid would be enough
to constitute a fair share. He also said the Gulf deployment
means that the White House and Congress will probably be able
to achieve only about $42 billion in deficit reduction for
fiscal 1991, instead of the $50 billion they had been aiming
to save.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) said after the meeting that
he favors a "special tax" or tax surcharge specifically
earmarked to cover the costs of the Gulf campaign, putting
the effort on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.
   There wasn't any indication Mr. Bush would endorse either
the budget projection or the tax idea, lawmakers said, though
Rep. Gephardt said the president indicated he'd keep trying
to win more foreign financial support. But Mr. Bush also
warned that U.S. troops shouldn't be turned into
"mercenaries" and argued that the U.S. has its own strategic
interests in the Gulf.
   While Mr. Bush was rounding up congressional support, Iraq
continued to send conflicting signals on the fate of
foreigners it holds.
   The State Department said nine more Americans were seized
by Iraqi troops in Iraq and occupied Kuwait, bringing the
total in captivity to 70. And the department said it had been
informed by the Iraqi government that one of the Americans
being held, an unidentified man, had died of a heart attack.
   But Iraq's Saddam Hussein held another television
appearance with Western hostages, and his government said
afterward that all the foreign women and children being
detained could leave Iraq. Also, Iraqi officials said they
would expel some American diplomats in retaliation for Mr.
Bush's expulsion of Iraqi diplomats in Washington, even
though Iraq is barring other U.S. diplomats from leaving.
   On the diplomatic and military front, Iraq showed no signs
of softening its position. It declared that occupied Kuwait
was now an Iraqi province, and Saddam Hussein challenged Mr.
Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to a
televised debate on the issue, a gambit that was labeled
"sick" by State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Meanwhile, a Defense Department spokesman said Iraq now
has massed 265,000 troops in Kuwait and nearby areas. That
compares to a U.S. estimate last week of 200,000 troops. Of
the Iraqi troops, 150,000 are deployed in Kuwait, a Pentagon
spokesman said, while the rest are positioned in an undefined
"contiguous area."
   "It's still largely a defensive thing," the Pentagon
spokesman said of the Iraqi deployment. "But obviously they
have the capability to switch to an aggressive, offensive
force very quickly."
   President Bush said the naval embargo of Iraq was holding
tight with even the Jordanian port of Aqaba now largely idle.
The U.S. Navy said it boarded a ship bound for Jordan to
check for cargo destined for Iraq. The Navy subsequently let
the ship proceed.
   Defense sources in Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, disclosed that
multinational forces are considering seeking a United Nations
resolution to impose an air blockade to halt sanctions --
busting flights to Baghdad, according to a wire-service pool
report. Such a move, which would involve all of Iraq's
neighbors, is viewed as a means of further pinching Baghdad's
economy.
   During his meeting with lawmakers, Mr. Bush explained that
he sent U.S. forces to the Gulf because "what's at stake is a
swallowing of a nation, standing by our friends, and control
of world oil reserves by a repressive regime," according to
Rep. Frank McCloskey (D., Ind.).
   After the meeting, Sen. John Chaffee (R., R.I.) said, "I
didn't hear a voice raised that was critical." Sen. James
Exon (D., Okla.), agreed, saying: "I heard no criticism."
   But the lawmakers interspersed their expressions of
support with questions that they said often failed to attract
specific answers from Mr. Bush and a bevy of administration
officials who joined him at the meeting.
   These questions focused on such matters as whether the
trade embargo alone will suffice to free Kuwait, whether
there can be a diplomatic solution, and whether military
force would be used. In addition, there were questions about
whether the U.S. should try to oust Saddam Hussein and
destroy his military assets before leaving the Gulf.
