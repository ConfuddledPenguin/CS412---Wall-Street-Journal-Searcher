   BUSH BRIEFED Congress, and Iraq said captive women and
children could leave.
   While lawmakers offered their support at the White House
meeting, they said they were concerned about the effects of
the Gulf mobilization on the U.S. economy and uncertain how
the president intends to proceed. The Pentagon doubled its
cost estimate for the buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi
officials said they want to buy $9 billion of U.S. arms.
Baghdad, despite its statement concerning the hostages,
declared Kuwait to be an Iraqi province. Saddam Hussein said
he was willing to talk to Bush and Britain's Thatcher via
television, but the U.S. wasn't receptive.

   Five Security Council members urged warring factions in
Cambodia to accept a peace plan that includes a major role
for the U.N. during a transition leading to free elections. A

billion to $5 billion over two years and involve up to 10,000
peacekeeping troops and 10,000 civilian personnel.
   Sen. Richard Lugar said he was told by Vietnamese
officials that they have removed all their troops from
Cambodia and will support elections there. The Indiana
Republican visited Hanoi this month and met with Vietnam's
foreign minister.
