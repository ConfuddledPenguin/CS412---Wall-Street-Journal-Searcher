   ARMONK N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp.
announced nationwide availability of its new PS/1 home
computer, which it said had performed "on plan" in three test
markets.
   IBM also said it rushed into distribution a companion
printer for the computer. The new PS/1 printer, which lists
for $449 and is a variation on the firm's ProPrinter
dot-matrix technology, had originally been planned for
availability in the Christmas season. But IBM found that 80%
of its home-computer customers bought a printer at the same
time, and decided the market was too big to pass up.

   In its initial three markets -- Chicago, Dallas-Fort
Worth, and Minneapolis-St. Paul -- IBM said it sold
"thousands" of PS/1s in 60 days. About three-quarters of PS/1
customers were first-time home-computer buyers, IBM said, and
80% bought the top-of-the-line model, higher than expected.
About half bought the PS/1 through IBM's new distribution
channel, department stores such as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
   Anthony Santelli, who headed the IBM team that developed
the PS/1, said he expected 1990 unit sales of the computer to
be "in the hundreds of thousands." Though he was leery of
projecting 1991 unit sales, he said a figure of one million
"isn't unreasonable."
   IBM said the PS/1, which lists for $999 to $1,999 in the
U.S., will be available in Europe and Canada starting Sept.
4.
