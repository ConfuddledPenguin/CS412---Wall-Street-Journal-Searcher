   Coast Savings Financial Inc. said in Los Angeles that it
is trying to sell 27 Southern California retail banking
offices owned by its thrift unit.
   In offering the branches for sale, Coast is seeking to
bolster its capital. "We're currently in compliance" with
federal capital rules, but "we want to be ahead of the game"
when capital requirements are increased under new thrift
rules, said Ray Martin, Coast's chief executive officer.

   In recent months, a weakening real estate market in
California and some bad assets outside of the state have
taken their toll on Coast. In its second quarter, the thrift
company reported a net loss of $28.7 million, or $1.89 a
share.
