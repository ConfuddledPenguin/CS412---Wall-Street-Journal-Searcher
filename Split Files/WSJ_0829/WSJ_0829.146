   In-Store Advertising Inc.'s stock plunged yesterday after
the company announced that second-half revenue would be
substantially lower than analysts had expected.
   In-Store dropped $7.50 a share to $7.25 in heavy national
over-the-counter trading yesterday. The company, which
delivers ad messages to shoppers through a network of
in-store electronic signs, went public on July 19, issuing
two million shares at $19 apiece. Yesterday, 1.36 million
shares were traded, nearly five times the normal volume.

   After the market closed, the company expressed surprise at
investors' reaction to the announcement and maintained that
the outlook for growth was still fundamentally strong.
   Analysts, who had been expecting the company to post $29
million in revenue for the year, were surprised by a news
release that painted a bleaker picture for the second half.
The company, citing a lackluster advertising market, said it
expects a slowdown in advertisers' commitments in 1990's
second half.
   Yesterday, In-Store reported that its first-half net loss
narrowed to $356,511, or six cents a share, from nearly $2.3
million, or 35 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
First-half revenue leaped to $10.4 million from $1.6 million.
   The company's second-quarter net loss narrowed to
$449,099, or seven cents a share, from $1.3 million, or 20
cents a share. Revenue jumped to $5.3 million from $994,051.
