   FLINT, Mich. -- In a gesture of trust toward 500 unionized
workers at a gritty factory that stamps out truck body panels
here, General Motors Corp. three years ago told them that
they didn't have to punch a time clock when they left work.
   GM managers allowed workers to leave once they finished
banging out the day's quota of parts. The move sparked a
startling jump in productivity: Employees, many on the job
for more than 20 years, suddenly found ways to do a full
day's work before lunch.

   But management, dismayed at paying a full day's wage for a
half day's work, unilaterally increased the quotas to the
point that workers have to put in eight hours even at the
higher production levels they had achieved when they had the
incentive to finish early. The workers feel they have been
tricked into a speedup, and the United Auto Workers union is
threatening a local strike over the issue. A program
promising mutual benefit ended in mutual mistrust, an emotion
all too often present in auto-industry labor relations.
   The mistrust that sabotaged the Flint plant's modest
effort at cooperation illustrates the biggest obstacle UAW
leaders and Big Three executives must overcome as they head
into the final phase of their negotiations for a new national
contract. The UAW yesterday named GM as the target company
for negotiating a pattern-setting agreement to replace the
three-year pact expiring Sept. 14. The UAW said it chose GM
over Ford Motor Co. partly because Ford would have been able
to grant a job-security guarantee that GM would be
hard-pressed to match. More than anything else, the union
wants the contract to be uniform across the industry. Ford
hasn't closed any plants in the past three years, while GM
has closed four.
   Union leaders say the key to the negotiations is for the
companies to treat workers as partners, and guarantee their
jobs. Company officials want more freedom to move workers
from job to job, and a more cooperative, flexible
relationship with the union. Both must overcome suspicion of
the other to achieve their goals.
   "The problem can be summed up in one word: credibility,"
says Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of
California at San Diego. "The union doesn't believe that GM
will provide job security, and GM doesn't believe the union
will provide the flexibility it needs."
   But the UAW and the Big Three -- GM, Ford and Chrysler
Corp. -- need each other now in a way they haven't since
1982. Then, the unifying threats facing the auto industry
were a severe recession and imports of Japanese compact cars.
Now, another recession is near, and Japanese auto makers are
forging into almost every segment of the U.S. car market.
   Japanese companies now account for almost 30% of all U.S.
car sales, up from 25% in 1987, when the previous contract
was negotiated. The Big Three's share of the U.S. car market
fell to 65% from 70% in that period. Japanese firms have
opened five assembly plants in the U.S. since 1987, and now
operate more car plants here than Ford. Productivity is
higher in those plants. GM requires 30.3 man-hours to build a
car, six more than required by Japanese plants in the U.S.,
according to industry consultant James Harbour.
   The UAW, for its part, also has been thwarted by the
Japanese companies, whose plants in the U.S. represent a
major potential source of growth for the union. Last year, it
suffered a humiliating defeat when workers at a Nissan Motor
Corp. plant in Smyrna, Tenn., rejected UAW representation by
a margin of more than 2-1. The Big Three now employs 440,000
UAW members, down from 510,000 in 1987; nonunion workers at
Japanese plants in the U.S. nearly doubled to 13,000 in the
period.
   Just a few years ago, Big Three executives and UAW leaders
alike were clamoring for the Japanese to build more plants in
the U.S., so all the companies would compete on a "level
playing field."
   To an outsider, all this would seem to call for a radical
re-invention of industry-labor relations. But don't bet on
it. Most industry officials expect the national talks to
produce nothing more than evolutionary change. The union will
get a more comfortable safety net for displaced workers, and
the companies will get a little more flexibility. The
Japanese will keep their huge advantages in costs and
efficiency.
   To be sure, the UAW and the Big Three have come a long way
from their constant confrontations of the 1970s. In 1987, in
fact, the UAW continued to negotiate with Ford after the
contract had expired, and a new pact was reached without a
strike. The unprecedented step was possible largely because
Ford really has delivered job security in recent years, in
exchange for more moderate wage demands by workers.
Nonetheless, far too often the Big Three and the UAW still
cross swords instead of joining hands.
   Examples abound. When Chrysler and the union opened
bargaining in July, UAW officials cursorily dismissed a
proposal that would have paid employees some of the money
they save by improving attendance or quality. The UAW, in
addition to its automatic preference for uniform contracts
throughout the industry, mistrusts Chrysler. The union
granted the company big givebacks when Chrysler was in
trouble in the early '80s, and the UAW feels the company
never returned the favor after the concessions helped it back
to health.
   At GM, the union recently drew a line in the sand at a
Flint plant that makes gasoline tanks. GM, despite a pledge
not to close plants, had announced plans to close a portion
of the factory that makes radiator brackets and lay off about
600 workers. The UAW earlier this month sanctioned a six-day
strike that had a ripple effect, forcing the auto maker to
temporarily close part or all of six assembly plants and 10
parts factories. Before that, the union had been satisfied to
seek arbitration over what it considered infractions of the
company's no-closings pledge.
   The union struck to press the job-security worries of
members like Harold Allen, 36 years old, who is currently
laid off from the Flint plant the union struck. In the 17
years since Mr. Allen first went to work for GM, he has spent
about as much time on layoff as he has on the job.
   Mr. Allen has been helped, however, by the big, expensive
safety net the union negotiated with the company during the
1980s. GM is paying him full wages and benefits to take
college classes. But the future is uncertain for him, his
wife and his four children. "I'd like to get out of this
program and back to work," he says.
   GM settled the Flint strike by delaying plans to close the
radiator-bracket operation and promising to bring enough
business back into the facility to keep the workers busy for
the next five years. By that time, presumably, many older
workers will have retired with full pension benefits, making
room for Mr. Allen and others to be recalled to work. GM had
never before offered such terms. But the pattern of strike
followed by compromise is how the industry has long operated.
   The pattern endures because each side has good reason to
be wary of the other. Three years ago, GM included a
plant-closing moratorium in its contract with the UAW. But by
calling closedowns "indefinite idlings" instead of
"closings," GM has closed four car plants and has laid plans
to close three truck plants by 1992. In all, GM has
eliminated one in 10 of its UAW jobs since 1987.
   This year, GM compounded the UAW's outrage by paying top
executives bonuses for 1989 averaging $44,800 a person, and
at the same time telling workers that slim profits would
limit their UAW-negotiated profit-sharing to just $50 apiece.
In the spring, GM nearly doubled the pensions of top
executives. News of the plan hit just as top UAW officials
were trying to convince restive troops that it would be too
costly to demand cost-of-living-adjustments to worker
pensions. Union leaders fumed, but the new executive pension
plan went through. Recently retired Chairman Roger B. Smith
will draw an annual pension of $1.1 million.
   The UAW's relations with Chrysler aren't much better. The
union is smarting over the No. 3 auto maker's decision to
close an aging plant in Detroit earlier this year, and its
plans to close another factory in St. Louis next month.
   Ford's labor relations are in better shape, largely
because Ford made big cuts in its work force during the early
1980s and, with the help of several well-executed products,
has been able to run its plants close to capacity for the
past few years. It has thus avoided permanent layoffs in
recent years. Ford has also kept its work force lean by using
overtime instead of increased hiring to meet heavy demand.
   While the union has legitimate grievances, the companies
have valid gripes of their own. Absenteeism at many Big Three
plants runs as high as 15% a day, and can force factories to
close for several days during Michigan's deer-hunting season.
Generous health-care benefits negotiated in the days when the
Big Three were a virtual oligopoly now add $600 or more to
the cost of each Big Three vehicle.
   The companies and the union have established elaborate
so-called jointness programs designed to improve
productivity, quality and relations between company and
union, but those have become a costly bureaucracy. At GM
alone, more than 17,000 people work in various "jointness"
activities. In all, the companies spent more than $200
million last year on the programs, which include paying
laid-off workers to find more efficient ways to assemble
autos. Despite all this, union-company relations are still
governed by a 500-page contract that has a list of amendments
longer than the document itself.
   What's most striking, perhaps, is that commitment to
cooperation varies widely from plant to plant, and its
chances of success are hurt by longstanding labor-management
acrimony. At GM's big luxury-car assembly plant in Lake
Orion, Mich., for example, more than 120 people work in joint
labor-management programs. But Lake Orion has one of the
worst labor relations records in the company.
   Worker opposition forced the plant management to scrap an
effort to get employees to operate in teams to improve
efficiency and quality. Earlier this year, several Lake Orion
workers touched off an unsanctioned strike in a dispute over
the safety of a machine that mates car bodies to their
engines. The walkout lasted just a few hours, but sparked a
bitter dispute between the union and GM after the auto maker
fired four workers involved in the incident. They were
reinstated by an arbitrator last week.
   Just across the street from the Lake Orion assembly plant,
however, GM has a small plant that makes car seats. Here,
with relatively little fanfare, managers and the 216 UAW
members have worked together to cut by more than 80% the
number of flaws in the seats they make for the Oldsmobiles
and Cadillacs assembled across the street. GM got help from
Harold Masters, a 47-year-old forklift driver, who suggested
and helped win acceptance for a plan to improve the plant's
system for ordering seat cushions.
   While Mr. Masters's suggestion may be an example of the
kind of union cooperation GM needs, his job is of the sort
that illustrates the kind of productivity problems the
company doesn't need. For hauling crates of cushions and
boxes of covers from the receiving docks to the line that
assembles the seats, Mr. Masters earned $59,000 last year,
albeit by working a lot of overtime and by skipping
vacations. He expects to earn just as much this year.
   Even Mr. Masters doesn't believe his job is worth that
much. "It's stupid. I think it's really ridiculous," he says
from the seat of his dingy yellow forklift. But as long as
the UAW can get that kind of money from GM, Mr. Masters says,
"I'll take it."
   The Big Three's rivals have only a few jobs like Mr.
Masters's. At those companies, the work would more likely be
performed by a worker at an independent subcontractor earning
perhaps $10 an hour less than a UAW member. That's because
the Japanese companies in the U.S., while paying virtually
identical wages for assembly workers, use independent parts
companies much more than the Big Three. Union resistance to
such "outsourcing" is the reason.
   For example, a worker at Johnson Controls Inc., the
biggest independent U.S. maker of car seats, earns half of
what Mr. Masters does for the same job. Not surprisingly,
Johnson Controls is snapping up most of the seat-making
business at the U.S. assembly plants of Nissan, Honda Motor
Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. And Johnson Controls' lower-cost
seats are helping those Japanese companies build lower-cost
cars than the Big Three.
   Thus, the Big Three and the UAW face hard choices. "They
ultimately have to build higher-quality products at lower
costs," says Douglas K. Laughlin, an analyst with Bear
Stearns &amp; Co. "If they don't, it's a slow, painful death."
   Union members say they'll fight any assault on their
standard of living. But many are like Ernie Emery, president
of the union local that represents the Lake Orion assembly
plant. His advice to his son speaks volumes about what he
really believes about the future of the U.S. auto industry.
When his son showed interest in mathematics as a high-school
student, Mr. Emery told him to become an accountant, not an
auto engineer. And the young man followed his father's
advice.
   "I'm very happy," says Mr. Emery, "that he found
employment outside the auto industry."
