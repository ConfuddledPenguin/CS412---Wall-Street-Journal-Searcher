   VIENNA -- Oil ministers meeting here delayed, probably
until today, announcement of plans by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to help offset world oil losses
from the Middle East crisis.
   Despite opposition by Iran, a majority of OPEC's ministers
agreed early yesterday to endorse production increases by any
of the 13 member nations with unused capacity. That action
would temporarily suspend output quotas established by the
group in July, and sanction combined additional output of
about three million barrels of oil a day by Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates.

   "It's an agreement to allow those who can do so to
increase production on a temporary basis," Diego Tamariz,
Ecuador's oil minister, said in an interview, adding: "Once
the crisis is over, we will go back to the July agreement."
   Though sought by the three countries, OPEC's approval of
their plans to raise output doesn't change the prevailing
outlook for oil supplies. That's because the nations involved
previously indicated they would go ahead without OPEC
sanction if necessary. So world oil markets have been
operating for weeks on the assumption the added oil
eventually would be coming.
   The ministers held off announcing their decision so that
absent representatives from Libya and Iraq could be notified
that the informal talks that began Sunday had been turned
into an official meeting of the organization's ministerial
monitoring committee.
   The output increases authorized by the meeting here won't
fully replace the four million barrels a day of oil removed
from world oil markets by the current embargo by consuming
nations against crude from Iraq and Iraq-occupied Kuwait. As
a result, OPEC also plans to call on the International Energy
Agency to help replace some of the lost oil.
   The Paris-based group is an organization of 21 major
oil-consuming nations formed in the wake of the oil shocks of
the 1970s to share supplies during shortages.
   OPEC plans to ask the IEA to have its members' governments
draw on oil they hold in storage and to share immediately the
"present huge inventories" of petroleum owned by oil
companies. OPEC's specific goal is that some of that oil be
shared with developing countries that don't have such stocks.
   Iran has tried to persuade OPEC to postpone any production
increases until the end of September while consuming nations
use up their oil stockpiles. Yesterday, Iranian oil minister
Gholamreza Aghazadeh recommended that the ministerial
committee meeting here be delayed for a week, "after which I
will propose OPEC should meet with the IEA."
   He maintained such a joint meeting would help oil-market
stability immediately and in the event a Middle East war
breaks out. "If we do this, we will have used the best time
-- a chance we should not ignore -- to bring about
cooperation between consumers and producers," he said.
   Neither the IEA nor the other oil ministers seemed
enthusiastic about Mr. Aghazadeh's suggestion. A Paris
official of the IEA was quoted by the Dow Jones International
Petroleum Report as saying that a meeting with OPEC "is not
in the cards."
   Meanwhile, several other delegates, including those from
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, were becoming irritated over the
duration of the meeting. "We are preparing our departure {by
noon today}," said one delegate, "and if the agreement isn't
signed by then, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela will leave."
