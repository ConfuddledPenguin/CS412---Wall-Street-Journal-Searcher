   Public authorities in the West particularly have been on a
building binge the past few years trying to attract big
business and professional meetings. New convention centers
have been erected in Portland, San Jose, San Diego, Seattle,
Palm Springs, Santa Clara and Oakland. Major expansions are
under way in San Francisco, Anaheim, Las Vegas, Los Angeles,
Long Beach and Sacramento. And no wonder: Spending at such
events is estimated to have more than tripled during the
1980s. All of which causes us to wonder whether the local
government officials involved have squared their grand
ambitions with their repeated incantations to lower the
federal budget deficit. If somebody decided to try to do that
by curbing the deductions for doing "business" at those
expensive gatherings, some public-sector party pooh-bahs
might find themselves turning as white as a concrete
elephant.
