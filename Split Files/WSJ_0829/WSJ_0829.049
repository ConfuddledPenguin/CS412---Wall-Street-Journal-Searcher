   HOUSTON -- Continental Airlines Holdings Corp. said it
will build an aircraft maintenance center on 150 acres at
Intercontinental Airport here at a cost of about $190
million, with completion scheduled for about 1993.
   The carrier said the city agreed to finance the project
with airport revenue bonds and that debt service on the bonds
will be paid by a long-term lease with Continental.

   Continental said about 4,000 workers will be required to
manage the facility, including new employees and Continental
workers who choose to transfer from the company's Denver
maintenance facility, which is to close soon.
