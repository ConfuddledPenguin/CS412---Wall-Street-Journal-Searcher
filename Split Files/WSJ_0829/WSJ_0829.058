   NEW YORK -- Financially troubled Kay Jewelers Inc. agreed
last month to be bought by Ratners Group PLC for securities
that Ratners values at $17 a share. Earlier this month, Kay
Jewelers' chairman sold 17% of his family's stake for
substantially less, $13.13 a share, filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   The share price of the Alexandria, Va., jewelry-store
chain has dropped even further since the sale, closing
yesterday at $11.375 a share, down 25 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange trading.

   Money managers and analysts say the share price has been
falling not only on the stock market's overall weakness, but
also on the belief that Ratners overstated the value of the
new convertible preferred shares it is offering in the swap.
   On Aug. 1, Kay Jewelers chairman Anthonie van Ekris sold
60,000 shares for about $787,800, the filings show. And Harry
Braverman, a vice president of the company, sold his total
stake of 15,165 shares last month for $13.75 a share,
according to SEC filings. Mr. van Ekris and Mr. Braverman
could not be reached for comment. A company spokeswoman said
Mr. van Ekris's wife sold the shares, and that Mr. Braverman
is retiring.
   Robert M. Winer, analyst with Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co., puts
the value of Ratners' offer at $14 to $15 a share. But "there
is always some discount {in a share price} until the deal is
signed on the dotted line," he said. He also blamed the stock
market's overall decline for the drop in Kay Jewelers' share
price.
   William Whyte, analyst at Stephens Inc., said that even if
the securities offered by Ratners "were worth $17 at the time
of the offer {in early July}, recessions aren't good for the
jewelry business." Moreover, he said, if the deal goes
through, "Ratners is going to be a more highly leveraged"
company.
   Kay Jewelers is the nation's second-biggest seller of fine
jewelry, including diamonds, gold jewelry and watches. But
the company has been grappling for several months with
slackening demand, problems arising from its liberal credit
policies and a contraction of its bank credit lines.
   There is some concern that, since some of Kay Jewelers'
junk-bond holders are refusing to sell to Ratners, that the
merger won't go through. Under the terms of the acquisition
agreement, Ratners conditioned the deal on acquiring more
than half of each of Kay's two issues of junk bonds.
   Bondholders balked at Ratners's original offer of 75% of
face value, so the company recently increased the tender
offer to 90%. After Ratners did so, holders tendered about
91.5% of the $100 million issue of the company's notes due in
1999 but only 12.4% of the $50 million issue of notes due
1996.
   Technically, the deal could still be called off. But a
Ratners spokeswoman said that failure to get 50% of the
second bond issue "is not going to wreck the deal."
   Randy Hale, senior portfolio manager of Cincinnati
Financial Corp., which holds $1.5 million in Kay bonds, was
also confident the acquisition will take place. "Ratners has
committed large amounts of capital now," Mr. Hale said. "They
have bought those bonds. They didn't do that to become a
bond-portfolio manager."

   A GOOD SPORT: Peter Ueberroth, former commissioner of
major league baseball, recently increased his holdings in
Coca-Cola Co. by 40%, according to SEC filings.
   Mr. Ueberroth, a director of the Atlanta beverage giant,
paid $178,640, or an average price of $44.66 a share, for
4,000 Coca-Cola shares on Aug. 2. In New York Stock Exchange
trading Coca-Cola shares closed at $41.75 yesterday, up 12.5
cents.
   While Mr. Ueberroth serves as a director of 11 companies,
according to SEC filings, this was his first insider purchase
of stock this year. Mr. Ueberroth couldn't be reached for
comment.

   BANKING OUT WEST: Peter B. Bedford, real estate developer
and director of BankAmerica Corp., increased his holdings in
the San Francisco bank holding company by 40% with a recent
purchase of shares. SEC filings show he spent $397,500 on
20,000 shares in August.
   Mr. Bedford paid $19.875 a share for his new holdings. In
New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, BankAmerica shares
closed at $22.125, up 75 cents.
   Mr. Bedford declined to comment. But his purchase comes at
a time of relatively good earnings and strong improvement in
BankAmerica's asset quality. For the second quarter, it
reported net income of $267 million, or $1.17 a share, down
from year-earlier earnings of $304 million, or $1.50 a share.
Analysts considered the results to be a slight improvement
over year-earlier figures, which were boosted by $44 million
from cash interest payments from Brazil that didn't recur in
the latest quarter. The bank holding company also said it
reduced its nonaccrual assets during the quarter by 21%, to
$3.1 billion.
