   PITTSBURGH -- Mellon Bank Corp. said it is considering the
sale of its corporate trust business, but will continue to
serve as trustee for municipal debt issues.
   Mellon said a number of prospective buyers have indicated
an interest in the corporate trust business, which has annual
revenue of about $5 million. The bank holding company said it
expects to complete a bidding process and reach an agreement
on the sale in this year's fourth quarter.
