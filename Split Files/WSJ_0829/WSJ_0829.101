   In an otherwise lackluster day of over-the-counter
trading, investors clobbered newly public In-Store
Advertising after the New York company said that 1990 revenue
will be substantially below expectations.
   In-Store Advertising lost more than half its market value
in a 7 1/2-point dive to 7 1/4 -- less than two months after
the installer of promotional signs for supermarkets went
public at $19 a share. The news sent investment bankers at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, which led the initial underwriting,
scurrying to New York to investigate the company's outlook.

   The unexpected forecast was a "clear surprise," according
to Alex. Brown Chief Operating Officer A.B. Krongard, who
called the due-diligence examination of the company
"intense." However, yesterday's disaster adds to recent
embarrassments for Alex. Brown, one of this year's lead
underwriters of initial and secondary offerings.
   Elsewhere, OTC stocks added slightly to Monday's sharp
gains in quiet trading as investors continued to watch the
Middle East. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.59 to 382.86,
a 0.42% gain. Volume dwindled to 117.8 million shares from
129.4 million Monday. Advancing stocks still led decliners,
1,045 to 855. But 120 issues hit new lows yesterday while
only 12 reached new highs.
   The day's low volume indicates "it doesn't look like
anyone's convinced" the market will sustain a rally, said
Hedi Reynolds, director of OTC trading at Morgan Keegan &amp; Co.
in Memphis. "We seem to be slaves to what news comes out of
Iraq," said Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co., noting that institutions "nibbled" at
better-quality stocks.
   Shortly after the market opened, In-Store reported that it
expects full-year 1990 revenue will be "substantially below"
analysts projections. In-Store said delays in deliveries to
certain customers, a slowdown in advertisers' commitments for
the second half of the year and a soft advertising market,
among other factors, will produce 1990 revenue much lower
than expected. Analysts had been estimating 1990 revenue for
the company of $29 million, more than three times 1989
revenue of $8.3 million.
   Analyst James Thayer of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., which
co-managed the In-Store offering, said that he had been
expecting In-Store's 1990 revenue would reach about $30
million, with earnings of about 40 cents a share. His
estimates now are under review. In-Store also reported that
its second quarter losses narrowed to seven cents a share
from 20 cents a year earlier. The company said it is on track
with plans to expand its signs into 3,600 stores by year end
and 6,000 by the end of 1991.
   Alex. Brown defends its underwritings, pointing out that
the average price increase of all its lead-managed initial
public offerings in 1989 and 1990 was 41% through the first
half of the year, compared with a 3.1% rise in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index during the same period. However, the
company's reputation recently has been sullied as two stock
offerings -- Urcarco and BizMart -- suffered following
disappointing earnings outlooks.
   At Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis, investors
continue to buy some of the stronger medical-related issues,
said Nicholas Karos, senior OTC trader there. Among the day's
gainers, St. Jude Medical added 1 3/8 to 31 5/8; United
Health Care added 1/4 to 17 3/8; and U.S. HealthCare gained
3/4 to 19.
   Oracle Systems, the day's most active stock, slid 1 7/8 to
a 52-week low of 12 3/8 after analysts at Dean Witter
Reynolds and Montgomery Securities lowered their 1991
earnings estimates for the Redwood City, Calif., marketer of
database software, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.
   Traders also told DJPIR the analysts' comments added to
selling pressure caused by Oracle's announcement late Monday
that it restated its revenue for the second and third
quarters of the 1990 fiscal year ended May 1991.
   Montgomery analyst David Bayer, maintaining a "hold"
opinion on Oracle, said he doesn't expect Oracle's shares to
react well to earnings uncertainties and overall skittishness
in the market.
   However, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Timothy R. McCollum
told DJPIR he's maintaining a long-term "buy" opinion on the
stock and expects Oracle to perform well in 12 to 18 months
after negotiating a new phase in its growth "similar to what
Sun Microsystems went through last year."
   Novell, the day's second most-active stock, gained 2 1/2
to 26 1/2. Monday, the Provo, Utah, maker of high-performance
computer networking systems exceeded analysts' expectations
with earnings for the third quarter ended July 28 of 38 cents
a share, more than double year-earlier earnings of 18 cents a
share.
   Salomon Brothers analyst Michel Guite said in an interview
that the bullish report prompted him to raise his earnings
estimates for Novell to $1.30 a share in 1990 and $1.61 in
1991 from his previous estimates of $1.26 and $1.51 a share,
respectively. In 1989, Novell earned 73 cents a share,
adjusted for a two-for-one stock split paid Aug. 17.
   Mr. Guite, who was among several analysts who repeated
"buy" opinions on Novell last week, said he expects the
company will be able to sustain earnings growth even amid a
slowdown in technology because of its move into
less-expensive software products from hardware products.
   Other technology shares were mixed. Sun Microsystems added
3/4 to 29 5/8; Microsoft jumped 2 1/8 to 67 7/8; Quantum
gained 1 1/8 to 18 3/8; Apple Computer rose 3/8 to 38 1/8;
and Conner Peripherals edged up 1/8 to 23 3/4. Intel,
however, eased 5/8 to 35 5/8.
   VLSI Technology skidded 1 3/8 to 5 1/2 after the San Jose,
Calif., maker of integrated circuits said it expects a
third-quarter loss. VLSI cited a soft market and its decision
to get out of the "highly competitive" static random-access
memory business. The company expects the phaseout will result
in a one-time, third-quarter charge of $12 million to $15
million. In addition, VLSI said it expects an operating loss
for the quarter.
   Powell Industries climbed 1 to 9 1/2 after the Houston
maker of controls and other equipment reported net income
from continuing operations for the third quarter ended July
31 rose to 21 cents a share from eight cents a year earlier.
Powell also said it expects continued improvement in all
operations for the remainder of the year.
   Tech Data Corp. climbed 1/2 to 6, although the Clearwater,
Fla., distributor of computer hardware products reported
Monday that net income for the second quarter ended July 31
fell to 20 cents a share from 30 cents a year earlier.
   Mid-American Waste Systems, also a recent initial public
offering underwritten by Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, extended its
slide after it was reported Monday that Waste Management Inc.
rather than Mid-American could snare a major contract with
the city of Jacksonville, Fla. Mid-American skidded 2 1/2 to
25. The company went public in May at $24 a share.
   BayBanks added 7/8 to 12 7/8 in brisk trading on
speculation that Laurence Tisch, who recently increased his
stake in Bank of Boston Corp., might have been the buyer
Friday of more than 500,000 BayBanks shares, DJPIR reported.
