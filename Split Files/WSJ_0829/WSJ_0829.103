   NEW YORK -- The stock market, breaking a recent pattern of
sharp price swings, finished mixed in lackluster trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.22 to 2614.85 --
its smallest price change by far in nearly two weeks -- as
the latest developments in the Persian Gulf conflict failed
to sway the market much in either direction.

   "We're back to a neutral zone, where {the market} could
break either way depending on the news in the Middle East,"
said Ronald B. Doran, director of institutional trading at
C.L. King &amp; Associates, Albany, N.Y.
   Broader market indexes also finished the session near
Monday's closing levels. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
dropped 0.10 to 321.34, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.08 to 176.26 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 0.01 to 297.67.
   Speculation about a possible negotiated settlement of the
Mideast crisis had fueled a surge in stocks Monday, when the
Dow Jones industrials soared 78.71 points after rising 49.50
points Friday. In the three sessions immediately before that
rebound, the average had tumbled a total of 173.02 points.
   By contrast, the industrial average spent the latest
session drifting within a range of less than 20 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 837 to 664 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where the pace of trading slowed
for the third session in a row. Big Board volume totaled
127,650,000 shares, down from 160,150,000 shares Monday.
   The market's earlier display of volatility "has scared a
lot of people," Mr. Doran said, and many players have
retreated to the sidelines to await further events in the
Middle East crisis. "From a trading standpoint, you have to
take a low profile and keep your head down, knowing that
sparks could fly at any moment."
   In the meantime, the market was able to hold its ground
despite an upturn in October crude-oil futures, which
rebounded 97 cents a barrel in New York trading after
plunging $4 a barrel Monday, and renewed weakness in the bond
market. Longterm Treasury bond prices fell a half point, or
$5 per $1,000 face amount.
   Donald E. Carver, president of Centre Square Investment
Group, Philadelphia, said he expects the market to go through
a "wait-and-see" period and remain on hold through the Labor
Day weekend.
   "We're guessing that this is a good time to do
bottom-picking," Mr. Carver said, although he added that his
firm is concentrating on consumer issues which have
multinational operations and "predictable earnings growth
rates."
   Chevron added 1 1/8 to 75 5/8, Texaco climbed 1 3/4 to 62
3/4 and Exxon gained 1/2 to 50 1/8, providing a lift to the
Dow Jones industrials. Other major oil stocks also posted
solid gains; Mobil gained 1 to 63 1/4, Amoco added 1 3/8 to
55 3/4 and British Petroleum jumped 2 1/2 to 81 1/2.
   McDermott International advanced 1 1/4 to 27 1/4 as
oilfield-services issues also rallied. Schlumberger gained 1
1/4 to 63 1/4, Halliburton added 7/8 to 53 and Dresser
Industries rose 3/8 to 47 3/8.
   General Motors, which said it is stepping up production of
cars equipped with driver-side air bags, rose 1 1/8 to 40 1/4
on composite volume of 1.7 million shares. The stock was the
Big Board's most active issue.
   Separately, the United Auto Workers picked GM as its
target for this year's contract talks with the Big Three U.S.
automakers, as expected. Shares of the other two auto makers
also moved higher; Ford Motor added 3/8 to 35 7/8 and
Chrysler rose 1/2 to 13 1/4.
   TCBY Enterprises fell 1 1/2 to 7 5/8 after forecasting net
income of 25 cents to 30 cents a share for its third quarter
ending Aug. 31, down from 43 cents a share a year ago. The
company noted that sales at stores open at least one year had
shown percentage drops of about 15% during June and July.
   L.A. Gear climbed 7/8 to 15 1/4 on 1.5 million shares.
Several analysts contacted by Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report said they couldn't explain the rally; other market
players pointed to possible short covering, or buying to
offset sales of borrowed stock, according to the investor
report.
   Gap Inc. added 1/2 to 52 7/8. The company declared a
2-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by
32%.
   Cineplex Odeon, featured in The Wall Street Journal's
"Heard on the Street" column yesterday, went up 1/2 to 3. A
glimmer of a turnaround at the debt-laden company and the
recession-resistant potential of its movie-theater operations
have caused a few investors to warm up to the stock, the
Journal reported.
   USAir Group dipped 3/8 to 15 7/8. A page-one story in the
Journal yesterday outlined several problems facing the
airline, including tough competition, high costs and
narrowing margins, as well as vulnerability to higher fuel
prices and to a U.S. recession. Separately, a group led by
hedge-fund manager Michael H. Steinhardt disclosed that it
had raised its stake in USAir to 9.46%.
   Newmont Mining gained 5/8 to 47 5/8. The company sold a
20% stake in Newmont Australia to Poseidon Gold, which began
a stock-swap offer for the remaining shares. Newmont Mining
said it still holds about 24% of Newmont Australia's common
and plans to either sell the shares in the open market or
tender them to Sydney, Australia-based Poseidon.
   Other precious-metals stocks also firmed modestly despite
a drop in gold prices as the sector, left out of the market's
surge Monday, drew renewed buying interest. American Barrick
Resources rose 1 3/8 to 21 5/8, Placer Dome rose 1/4 to 17
5/8, Battle Mountain Gold added 3/8 to 10 7/8 and Homestake
Mining rose 1/4 to 20.
   Santa Fe Pacific, which revised the terms of an offer to
swap cash and common stock for $200 million of debentures,
fell 3/4 to 15 7/8. Citing the market's recent plunge, the
company cut the minimum exchange value of common to be issued
under the offer by $3 a share, to $15.
   Meredith rose 1 1/2 to 24 1/2. A federal court rejected a
motion by the Federal Trade Commission to block R.R.
Donnelley  &amp; Sons' proposed $487.5 million acquisition of the
company's Meredith-Burda unit. Donnelley dropped 3/8 to 39.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.05
to 321.78. Volume totaled 10,280,000 shares.
