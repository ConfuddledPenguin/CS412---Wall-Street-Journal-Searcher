   NEW YORK -- The prospect of increased world oil production
and anticipation of a Japanese interest-rate rise boosted the
yen yesterday, adding to the gains it made Monday.
   Much of the yen's rise in early global trading came at the
expense of the dollar, pushing the U.S. currency below 143
yen for the first time in seven months. But later, as the
focus shifted to cross-trading of the yen and European
currencies, the dollar stabilized against the yen and was
pushed above Monday's levels against the mark and other
European currencies.

   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
143.73 yen, down from 144.25 yen late Monday. Near the end of
Japanese trading Tuesday, the dollar hit bottom at 142.80
yen, its lowest since Jan. 29, when it traded briefly at
142.50 yen. The dollar's New York close was its worst since
that same day in January, when it finished at 142.98 yen.
   The dollar was also changing hands late in the New York
session at 1.5563 marks, above 1.5510 marks late Monday. The
mark ended trading at 92.354 yen, down from 93.005 yen.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading
at about 143.25 yen, about unchanged from 143.20 yen at the
close there Tuesday. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at
about 1.5567 marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5488
marks.
   Another active cross, or non-dollar, market yesterday was
between Swiss francs and yen. The franc was quoted at 111.704
yen, down from 113.182 yen.
   Of the 11 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Nations
member nations meeting in Vienna, 10 indicated they would
support a suspension of production quotas for as long as the
military standoff in the Persian Gulf lasts. The increased
supply will help to fill the gap created by the embargo on
Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Iran opposed the decision, though
its oil minister later said Iran might reconsider if war
broke out. Iraq and Libya, the two other OPEC members, were
absent from the meeting.
   The yen has been sold since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, on the ground that Japan is more dependent on
imported oil than other nations.
   But interest in selling dollars to take profits is
becoming keen among Japanese investors, Tokyo market
participants said. After a difficult first half, Japanese
institutions are looking for ways to dress up their balance
sheets before their fiscal first half ends Sept. 30.
   A market that had been expecting a Japanese interest-rate
increase since June was put on guard yesterday by a Japanese
news service report that the Bank of Japan will raise its
discount rate by three-quarters of a percentage point today.
The benchmark rate stands at 5.25% and was last raised from
4.25% March 20.
   Despite the OPEC news, some oil prices rebounded from
Monday's big losses, supporting the dollar somewhat against
the yen in late New York trading. The benchmark crude-oil
futures contract closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at $27.88 a barrel, up 97 cents. But some later delivery
contracts declined, with November futures closing at $27.40 a
barrel, down 66 cents.
   The market continued to see signs of peace in the Mideast
but didn't trade on them. Helping the yen somewhat in Asian
trading were U.S. television reports that Iraqi troops had
been moved 10 miles back from the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian
border, where they had been massed.
   Most participants were awaiting the meeting scheduled for
tomorrow between United Nations Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The
U.N. official said yesterday he would insist that Iraq
respect Security Council resolutions demanding that it
withdraw from Kuwait and release foreigners it is holding.
   President Saddam Hussein announced late Tuesday that all
women and children hostages would be free to leave Iraq
today. Meanwhile, Iraqi newspapers published a presidential
decree annexing Kuwait as Iraq's 19th province.
   Meanwhile, the pound fell to $1.9428 and 279.24 yen late
in New York from $1.9438 and 280.39 yen Monday.
   The dollar was helped against the mark by reports that
East German unemployment rose to 350,000 this month from
272,017 the month before. The report focused attention on the
costs of German unification, scheduled for Oct. 3.
   The dollar ended mixed in calm European trading, with many
participants out of the market for their summer holidays or
sidelined until the outcome of tomorrow's U.N.-Iraqi talks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385 an ounce, down $3.30. Estimated
volume was a very heavy seven million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $388 an ounce.
