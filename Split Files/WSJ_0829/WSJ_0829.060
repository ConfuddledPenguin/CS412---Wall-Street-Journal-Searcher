   TOKYO -- The leading indicator for June slipped to 54.5
from a revised 58.3 in May but remained above the so-called
boom-or-bust line of 50 for the fourth consecutive month, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
   The indicator shows the Japanese economy remains strong
after 45 months of continued expansion and should sustain
growth in the future, the agency said. A reading exceeding 50
signals economic expansion and a reading below that level
indicates possible contraction ahead.

   Rising construction activity is fueling continued strong
personal consumption and capital investment expenditures,
keeping the economy humming, an agency official said.
Meanwhile, prices remain in a stable range.
