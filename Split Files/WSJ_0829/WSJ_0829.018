   Investors looking for bargains in the wake of the stock
market's August sell-off may be drawn to small stocks by
their attractive fundamentals.
   But no matter how alluring small stocks may look right
now, there are good reasons investors should probably resist
their siren song -- at least for the time being.

   Small stocks have been breaking investors' hearts for more
than seven years, shattering the great expectations they
engendered during their heyday in the late 1970s and early
1980s. Despite a brief return to favor in 1988 and early this
year, when they smartly outpaced the big-stock-dominated
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, they are languishing again.
   Just since the beginning of August, small stocks have
plunged about 13.2%, according to Wilshire Associates Inc.
The drop, measured on a total-return basis that includes
price changes plus dividends, compares with a 9.4% fall for
the S&amp;P 500. It brings small stocks' losses since January to
about 16.4% -- more than twice the 6.9% year-to-date setback
of the S&amp;P 500.
   While many investment professionals say small stocks are
so cheap now that they're bound to do well in the long run,
many of these pros add that small stocks aren't yet as cheap
as they could get, especially if the stock market resumes its
downward slide.
   "This probably isn't the time to jump in to small stocks,"
says Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. In the short term, he reasons, these
stocks have to grapple not only with the market's continuing
love affair with large, "quality" growth stocks -- but also
with tough competition from top-quality fixed-income
investments offering yields approaching 9% or even more.
   True, small stocks do look appealing on classic valuation
measures -- which compare stock prices to corporate earnings,
cash flow, dividends, debt and other fundamentals. But
"they're not back at the valuation levels {they hit in the
mid-1970s} that would argue for a tremendous surge in small
stocks," Mr. Bernstein says.
   Indeed, when small stocks were selling at rock-bottom
prices in the '70s, "we were at the end of the type of period
it appears we may be just entering now -- namely, a
recession," says Paul Ferri, managing general partner at
Matrix Partners, a Boston-based venture capital firm. These
stocks "may be relatively cheap now, but they're going to be
beaten down more" if the economy weakens, he says.
   A struggling economy is generally bad news for all types
of stocks, but there is a special risk with small stocks
because they can be relatively "illiquid." That is, because
they are more thinly traded than large stocks, it can be
difficult to find a willing buyer when times get tough.
   "In a bad recession, the bids for small stocks could dry
up," says John Hagler, of Boston-based investment advisers
Hagler, Mastrovita &amp; Hewitt. "They may do well in the long
run, but you could probably die waiting for them to turn up
-- we've seen that before in 1973-74, when these stocks just
got cheaper and cheaper."
   The difference in liquidity between small stocks and large
stocks helps explain why small stocks tend to be especially
hard hit by bear markets. "They almost always fall farther
and faster than big stocks in significant market declines,"
says Laurence B. Siegel, managing director of Ibbotson
Associates Inc.
   An analysis by the Chicago research and consulting firm
found that small stocks dropped more than large stocks in all
but one of the six recession-related bear markets since 1929.
The exception was at the height of small stocks'
inflation-induced popularity in 1980-82, when they gained
3.3% while big stocks lost 16.9%.
   Although the recent hammering of small stocks' prices may
have discounted a portion of investors' jitters about their
extra risk, it's probably not enough to make them a haven if
the August sell-off turns into a genuine bear market.
   Before the August slide, for instance, some pros were
saying that prices of small stocks were so low they were
already reflecting investors' worst fears. "I made the
argument that small {stocks} would hold up better in a market
decline because they had done so poorly recently," says
Thomas Stevens, chief investment officer at Wilshire Asset
Management. "Then," he adds, a touch ruefully, "they took it
on the chin."
   Such disappointments may make investors slow to revise
their long-held bias that blue-chip growth stocks are the
place to be -- to the extent one wants stocks at all. That
bias was strongly reinforced in the late 1980s, as brilliant
earnings among blue-chip shares continually overshadowed
small stocks.
   As long as investors believe that safer, established
companies can continue to turn out profits at a rate as high
as or higher than most emerging companies, they aren't going
to be easily enticed to run the risks of owning small stocks,
many investment professionals say. "The longer we see this
growth-oriented large-capitalization market, the more likely
it is that small-capitalization stocks will be beaten up,"
says Merrill's Mr. Bernstein.
   As a simple way to gauge the small stocks' prospects, Mr.
Bernstein uses what he calls "the ankle biter index," which
essentially tracks the price of the S&amp;P 500 index relative to
its average per-share earnings. Historically, when the
market's current price earnings ratio is high relative to it
average level over the previous five years, small stocks
suffer "because they can't compete with the expectations for
large growth companies," he says.
   At today's levels, he recommends that investors "wait for
the market's {P/E} multiple to drop and long-term growth
forecasts to be cut for larger stocks" before loading up on
small stocks. Another positive sign for would-be small-stock
investors, he adds, "would be for interest rates to fall or
inflation to pick up so real {or inflation-adjusted} interest
rates are less competitive."
   Such vigilance could be richly rewarding for long-term
investors who can stomach the risks of buying such stocks in
a bear market. That's because the bear-market coin eventually
has a flip side: "When the market does start to recover,"
says Ibbotson's Mr. Siegel, "small stocks boom."
