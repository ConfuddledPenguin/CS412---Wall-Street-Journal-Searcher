   There we are at Mount Rushmore
   (That's where Billy's back got sore).
   And this was our trip to Disneyland
   (While changing a tire, Dad cut his hand).
   That's Anne on the roof of the Alamo
   (Just before she fell and broke her toe).
   Here's the Statue of Liberty, from the ferry
   (On which Mom got seasick, very).
   Our vacation slide show commentary
   Reads like a medical dictionary.

   Role Reversals
                                                                                                       

   As age barriers show signs of ending,
   Folks engage in some quite odd pursuits,
   With young whiz kids now running corporations --
   While retirees take newspaper routes.
