   Poseidon Gold Ltd., Sydney, Australia, offered to acquire
Newmont Australia Ltd. for about $647 million (U.S.) in a
stock swap and negotiated stock purchase.
   Poseidon's offer would exchange one of its shares for
every two shares of Newmont Australia that it doesn't already
control. Poseidon said it has already agreed to purchase 20%
of the shares from Newmont Pty. for about 1.25 Australian
dollars (US$1.04) a share, or about A$166 million (US$137.7
million). Newmont Pty. is a regional exploration unit of
Newmont Mining, Denver.

   The offer is contingent on Poseidon acquiring at least 45%
of Newmont Australia.
   After the sale of the 20% stake, Newmont Pty. will
continue to hold about 24% of Newmont Australia's shares.
Newmont Australia holds interests in three gold mines in
Australia. It had sales of A$121.6 million in 1989. The
figure doesn't reflect its addition of the Tuckabianna mine
in May of this year. Newmont Mining owned all of Newmont
Australia until 1987, when it sold 25% to Australian
investors while it was fighting off a hostile bid by Texas
investor T. Boone Pickens Jr.
   A Newmont Mining spokesman in Denver said that, depending
on market conditions, the company will either sell its shares
into the offer or sell them on the open market.
   On the Australian Stock Exchange, Poseidon shares are
trading at about A$2.60 a share, while Newmont Australia
shares are trading at about A$1.12 a share.
   Newmont Mining is reducing its goldmining presence in
Australia in favor of gold exploration efforts in Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea, a company spokesman said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Newmont
Mining's shares rose 62.5 cents to $47.625.
