   Steven P. Jobs's Next Inc. plans to introduce a slew of
new products Sept. 18, in what may be its last bid to become
a major player in the computer market.
   The rollout -- the second by Next -- will include a more
powerful workstation. Also, Lotus Development Corp. will
provide a version of its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet for the
new machine.

   Next was founded five years ago by Mr. Jobs, who
co-founded Apple Computer Inc. only to be forced out of the
company by the current chief executive officer, John Sculley.
In October 1988, Mr. Jobs introduced Next's first computer to
much fanfare. But the machine, dubbed the "black cube," has
sold poorly, dogged by criticisms that it runs too slowly,
lacks a color monitor and software applications and costs too
much. Mr. Jobs needs some hot products, fast.
   "Steve's going to have to perform a miracle," said Richard
E. Kaplan, vice provost for research and academic computing
at the University of Southern California.
   However, computer enthusiasts have applauded the software
chosen by Mr. Jobs to control the Next machine's basic
functions. The software is a variant of Unix -- a software
operating system widely used with technical computers -- and
it works with a novel set of screen icons and commands that
some observers say make it the software of choice for Unix
users. The software, however, is incompatible with that used
on Apple's Macintosh computers or International Business
Machines Corp. personal computers or their clones.
   While Mr. Jobs is enamored of his version of Unix, he aims
to fix most of his machine's shortcomings with his second
Next model. He won't describe the product, but industry
observers say it will be powered by Motorola Inc.'s 68040
microprocessor, a top-of-the-line chip that is expected to be
available later this year.
   The new model also will be designed to work with a color
monitor, and it will make even greater use of hard-disk
drives, a standard storage device eschewed by Mr. Jobs in his
original Next box but added later.
   Many observers say the new model, while an improvement
over the current one, won't be enough to propel Mr. Jobs's
company out of the also-ran category of computer
manufacturers.
   "There still isn't a compelling reason to buy it," said
Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a newsletter on
computers.
   That's partly because many customers for fancy workstation
computers -- the category Mr. Jobs sought to storm -- have
been mesmerized by hardware advances delivered by such
computer makers as Sun Microsystems Inc. Next hasn't been
able to match these advances.
   A lack of marketing focus and weak sales execution also
have hampered Next's progress. While the company has inked
some notable sales to corporations -- the William Morris
Agency, for instance, decided to outfit its offices with Next
machines -- Next mainly has persuaded universities to buy its
machines, offering deep discounts as an inducement.
   Besides losing out on some technical measures to Sun and
others, Next's prices also are higher, sometimes twice as
high, as competitors'. Currently, Sun and Hewlett-Packard Co.
each offer new models that cost universities less than
$3,250, half of Next's university price.
   Mr. Kaplan of USC expects Next to drop its prices on Sept.
18 or soon afterward, but even with such actions "these other
(workstation) guys are leapfrogging Next."
   Mr. Jobs has countered that Next's novel software
ultimately will hook customers, but Ms. Dyson thinks the
advances contained in Next's computers aren't radical enough
to "topple" the desk-top computing standards popularized by
IBM, Apple and Microsoft Corp., which sells MSDOS, the
personal-computer operating system, and Windows, an
extension.
   Besides, while Mr. Jobs has made much of how Next's
software makes it easier to create applications, some
software developers say that other versions of Unix actually
are easier to work with.
   "It's not clear that Next brings that many advantages,"
said Patrick Perez, chief executive of Neuron Data, a closely
held Palo Alto, Calif., concern that sells
artificial-intelligence programs for many computers,
including Next's.
   Mr. Jobs insists new applications from Lotus and others
will provide proof that Next's operating software is the soil
from which "truly revolutionary" applications will sprout.
Indeed, people who have seen Lotus's 1-2-3 for the Next say
it makes an eye-opening use of graphics and eases the
exchange of information with other applications.
   Whether even breakthrough software can rescue Mr. Jobs
from the margins of the computer industry remains a question.
Some observers say regardless of the software Next must
execute its plans flawlessly from here on out.
   "They've got to get it all right this time," said Jon
Seybold, editor of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing.
"There isn't another window for them."
