   PITTSBURGH -- Give fresh bait to a school of sharks and
you get a feeding frenzy. Dangle football tickets in front of
Pittsburgh Steelers fans and you get a bidding war.
   That's what happened here yesterday, when the trustee of a
company in bankruptcy proceedings auctioned 14 Pittsburgh
Steelers season tickets. About 90 desperate fans -- some
dressed in gray pin-striped suits, others in paint-flecked
work pants -- flocked to federal bankruptcy court to place
their bids on these coveted assets.

   When the dust settled, the winners had shelled out $21,300
-- a tidy sum, considering the face value of the tickets
totaled $2,736. No one reached deeper into his pocket than
Donald Cooper, a hair salon owner who dropped $6,100 for four
seats.
   "I don't even know how to spell $6,100," the 35-year-old
Mr. Cooper said as he prepared to write the check for his
tickets. "I kind of got swept away, but it's an emotional
thing."
   Mr. Cooper didn't seem concerned that the Steelers have
played poorly in preseason games. When handed the tickets, he
fingered them like precious jewels. "I have them," he
murmured. "I have them."
   The trustee, Joseph J. Bernstein, said the tickets were
worth the high prices because holders will be able to renew
their seats for future seasons. But the Steelers showed up in
court and objected.
   William H. Schorling, a lawyer for the team, said the
Steelers don't give season-ticket holders automatic renewal
rights, and plan not to renew the seats bought yesterday for
the 1991 season. "We have thousands of people who've been
waiting 10, 11 years for season tickets," Mr. Schorling
explained.
   Moreover, he said, the auction amounted to scalping. He
argued that state law forbids tickets to be sold above their
face value.
   Judge Judith Fitzgerald said the issue of future rights
will be decided later. For now, premiums paid for the tickets
-- in Mr. Cooper's case, $5,380 -- will be held in escrow.
   Quietly watching the whole proceeding was Harry G. Jones,
who once held the 14 tickets as principal owner of I.D. Craig
Service Corp., a health insurer that filed for bankruptcy
protection last year. He'll have a different view of Steeler
games this year.
   "As long as my television works, that's all I need," he
said with a shrug. "It's cold in that stadium."
