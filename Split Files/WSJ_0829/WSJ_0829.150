   Despite Monday's $4 a barrel plunge in crude-oil futures
prices, motorists looking to pay less at the pump will likely
be disappointed.
   While a few oil companies -- Conoco Inc. and Phillips
Petroleum Co., for instance -- lowered wholesale prices
slightly after the sharp drop, most major oil companies said
they would maintain current prices. Exxon Corp. actually
raised its wholesale prices by six-tenths of a cent.

   The industry has defended its wholesale pricing, saying
the run-up in gasoline prices never kept pace with the
meteoric 50% jump in crude prices over the past four weeks.
Most oil companies say they are still trying to recoup their
costs. Unleaded gasoline prices at the pump are about 18%
higher since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, according to the
American Automobile Association.
   William C. Wood, associate professor of economics at James
Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., and a specialist in
natural resources and energy, said that had the price of
crude oil dropped by $4 before the Middle East crisis,
wholesale gasoline prices would have dropped, too.
   "A substantial fraction of the price reflects
uncertainty," he said. "It's not just how much (oil
companies) have to pay. It's more how can (they protect their
inventories) in the event that something unusual happens."
   The oil industry has been under attack from consumers,
politicians and government officials for raising gasoline
prices so quickly and so steeply following the start of the
Middle East crisis. Early on in the crisis, President Bush
asked major oil companies to hold the line on prices. The
Justice Department has since begun preliminary inquiries into
the sharp rise in gasoline prices.
   Conoco was first to react to the $4 a barrel drop in the
price of the October crude-oil futures contract in Monday
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Houston
company lowered prices on its branded wholesale gasoline by
two cents to five cents a gallon. It lopped an average of
10.65 cents a gallon off its unbranded wholesale gasoline.
   "We try to stay as close to the market as we can," a
spokesman said. Conoco is a unit of Du Pont Co., Wilmington,
Del.
   The futures prices took a nosedive Monday as tensions in
the Middle East seemed to ease. There were indications that
the U.S. might be backing away from possible military action
and was more inclined toward negotiating a resolution to the
crisis. Yesterday, however, the October crude-oil contract
regained 97 cents a barrel to close at $27.88.
   A spokesman for Phillips said the Bartlesville,
Okla.-based oil company was also responding to the market
when it cut wholesale gasoline prices by 5.27 cents a gallon
to 93.91 cents.
   Gasoline price changes happen all along the supply chain,
from refiners to wholesalers to corner stations, but are tied
very closely to futures prices, which seesaw back and forth
with every news report -- or rumor. The volatility of the
markets, where traders are focusing on the Middle East
situation and on a gathering of ministers from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, has
made it tough for some oil companies to say what they'll do.
   "It's very hard to project what we will do with prices,"
said a spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles.
"Our prices are substantially below the market (levels) and
in some instances our prices at the pump may not accurately
reflect the price of crude oil." Arco froze its wholesale
prices for a time following the invasion, but has since
raised them an average of 2.5 cents a gallon.
   Exxon raised its prices by six-tenths of a cent to 87.1
cents a gallon. A spokesman said, "Exxon's prices reflect its
assessment of competitive market conditions." He wouldn't
elaborate.
   San Francisco-based Chevron Corp. said it will maintain
its prices because it hasn't recovered the cost of higher
crude-oil prices. "We haven't passed on to the consumer our
full amount of the raw price," a spokesman said. Amoco Corp.
in Chicago and Mobil Corp. in New York will both hold tight
despite the drop. "In some areas, we are selling at cost," a
Mobil spokesman said.
   In Houston, a Shell Oil Co. spokesman said the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group unit "will be responding along with the
competition."
   Because so many of the major oil companies are maintaining
wholesale prices, experts expect retail prices to remain
about the same. "I wouldn't expect much change," said Mike
Doyle, an editor at Computer Petroleum Corp., a petroleum
price information service in St. Paul, Minn. The company
conducts weekly surveys on gasoline prices for the American
Automobile Association.
