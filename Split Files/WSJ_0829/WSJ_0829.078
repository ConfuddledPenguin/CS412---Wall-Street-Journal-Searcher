   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- MGM Grand Inc., the hotel-casino
and luxury airline company controlled by investor Kirk
Kerkorian, said it retained Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. to sell the
Desert Inn hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
   The Desert Inn, a boutique property that caters to
foreigners, includes an 821-room hotel and an 18-hole
championship golf course. The Strip property also has a
34-acre parcel that has been earmarked for a 2,000-room hotel
and casino.

   MGM Grand is planning another major Las Vegas project that
calls for a theme park, 5,000-room hotel and casino. Fred
Benninger, MGM Grand's chairman, said the company is so busy
with the theme park plan that it doesn't have time to develop
the Desert Inn.
   MGM Grand bought the Desert Inn and the Sands hotel-casino
in February 1988 for $167 million. It sold the Sands and 58.7
acres of nearby land to Interface Group for $110 million
later that year, and has invested about $35 million in
refurbishing the Desert Inn.
   Industry executives said MGM Grand had quietly been
shopping for several months before retaining Bear Stearns.
Michael E. Tennenbaum, a Bear Stearns vice chairman, said the
facility draws interest from Pacific Rim investors and other
foreigners because of its strong international business, but
noted that the extra acreage could allow a buyer to transform
the site into a more middle-market casino.
   Analysts speculated that MGM Grand would probably seek
more than $200 million for the property, but said it is
unlikely that it will be sold quickly, or at a premium price.
   To ease prospective buyers' worries about obtaining a
Nevada casino license, Mr. Tennenbaum said, MGM Grand has
agreed to continue running the casino while the buyer is
investigated by state regulators. That process can take
anywhere from several months to more than a year, a factor
that has complicated past efforts to sell other Las Vegas
casinos.
