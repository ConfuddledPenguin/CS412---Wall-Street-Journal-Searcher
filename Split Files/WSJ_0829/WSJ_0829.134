   U.S. Surgical Corp. signed a two-year, sole-source
contract to supply Hospital Services Corp. of America with
its full line of surgical staplers.
   Hospital Services, a Bridgeton, Mo., group-purchasing
organization for 950 acute-care hospitals, said it will buy
more than $40 million in surgical stapling and laparoscopic
products from U.S. Surgical during the term of the contract.

   Surgical staples are an alternative to stitches.
Laparoscopy involves surgical viewing of the pelvic organs.
   The agreement also provides that U.S. Surgical, which is
based in Norwalk, Conn., will be Hospital Services' sole
supplier of suture products, which U.S. Surgical will
introduce by the first quarter of 1991.
