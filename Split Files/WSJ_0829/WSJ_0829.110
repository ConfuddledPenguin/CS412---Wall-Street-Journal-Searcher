   NEW YORK -- Two major oil companies suspended some
gasoline advertising because of uncertainty over the Mideast
crisis.
   Mobil Corp. will indefinitely delay a nationwide fall
campaign, set to debut on television and radio next week, a
spokeswoman said. Similarly, Exxon Corp. is temporarily
halting some spot commercials largely appearing on local
stations and the CBS Inc. network, but will keep airing other
commercials on cable television. Both companies intend to
resume their ads once the Mideast tensions ease.

   An Exxon spokesman said the company "made a normal
business decision to shift some . . . spot motor gasoline
television advertising to a later date." He declined to
elaborate.
   "Clearly, the Middle East is a factor in the shift," one
oil industry executive noted. "The question is: How much
value are you getting from promoting gasoline sales at this
time?"
   Both Mobil and Exxon declined to specify how much of their
1990 ad budgets will be affected by the postponements. In
1989, Mobil spent $24.8 million on advertising, and Exxon
spent $26.4 million, according to Leading National
Advertisers, an ad tracking firm.
   The oil industry is skittish about appearing to encourage
consumption of gasoline while supplies are pinched. The
industry came under a barrage of criticism earlier this month
when prices at local gas pumps soared after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
