   Primerica Corp., New York, said that its A.L. Williams
Corp. unit will eliminate about 250 jobs as part of a
restructuring.
   Primerica said the restructuring will affect all levels of
the insurance unit. Top A.L. Williams officials have already
been affected, including William Keane, its former president
who left the company earlier this month.

   The majority of job losses will come from A.L. Williams
and its affiliate, Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance
Co., which together employ 1,700 people. The company also
said the actions result from a review of all Primerica
subsidiaries and are expected to improve operating
efficiencies. Primerica, a diversified financial-services
concern, acquired Williams nine months ago.
