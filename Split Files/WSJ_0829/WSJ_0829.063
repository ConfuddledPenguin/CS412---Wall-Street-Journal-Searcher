   CHICAGO -- Maytag Corp. has agreed to distribute partial
refunds to customers who bought reconditioned Magic Chef
microwave ovens thinking they were new.
   Since 1987, as many as 50,000 people throughout the U.S.
have bought repackaged and reconditioned Magic Chef ovens
returned by other customers, at prices ranging from $80 to
$160. In a proposed settlement of three lawsuits against
Maytag, the manufacturer agreed to give each such customer
$25 in cash and a $10 certificate toward purchase of other
Magic Chef products.

   In the settlement proposal, which was tentatively approved
by a U.S. District Court judge in Birmingham, Ala., Maytag
denied the reconditioned ovens posed any health or safety
hazard to buyers, a company spokeswoman said. The company
also has agreed to halt the practice of reconditioning ovens,
she said. Not all Magic Chef microwave ovens the company sold
were reconditioned, and no reconditioned ovens were sold
under the company's other brand names, the spokeswoman said.
   Maytag agreed to pay as much as $300,000 to the Alabama
attorney general's office and a Birmingham law firm, which
filed the suits against the company.
