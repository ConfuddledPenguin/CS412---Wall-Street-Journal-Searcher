   MILAN, Italy -- Enimont S.p.A.'s managing director, Sergio
Cragnotti, in a surprise move, announced plans to resign,
saying soaring oil costs were exacerbating serious problems
the company already faces because of the long standoff
between its two major shareholders.
   The move came as Italy's new minister for state holdings,
Franco Piga, continued his attempt to mediate in the dispute
between Raul Gardini's Montedison S.p.A. chemical group and
state energy conglomerate Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi over
control of the Enimont venture.

   Mr. Cragnotti, a close aide of Mr. Gardini, has been
managing director since Enimont was set up in January last
year. He assumed full executive powers in May following the
resignation of the ENI-nominated president Lorenzo Necci.
   Mr. Cragnotti said his resignation, both as managing
director and as a member of the board, would take effect
Sept. 7, when an Enimont shareholders' meeting has been
scheduled.
   He explained his decision by saying that the continued
deadlock over control of the company, in the context of the
oil crisis, "has dramatically illustrated the impossibly
difficult conditions in which the management of the group is
working."
   Separately, Enimont said it was temporarily laying off
2,000 workers over a six-month period because of difficult
chemical-market conditions, higher oil prices and scarce
supplies of some primary materials.
   While Montedison and ENI each holds a 40% stake, most of
the remaining 20% has been in the hands of allies of Mr.
Gardini since early this year, giving him increased, but not
total, control of Enimont.
