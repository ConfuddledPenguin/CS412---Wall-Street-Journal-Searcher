   Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., said that the
power supply in 70,000 new computer printers is faulty and
that it will replace it for free.
   A spokesman for HP said the company will incur "virtually
no cost" through the offer. The replacement program involves
HP's LaserJet IIP, which the company introduced last
September. The IIP is HP's least expensive laser printer and
its first to sell in retail stores at prices below $1,000.

   The company said it learned of the problem late last year
and since February has been contacting customers with its
replacement offer.
   HP makes computers and related electronics equipment. Its
computer printer unit takes in an estimated $1.4 billion a
year, and laser printers are its high-end products.
