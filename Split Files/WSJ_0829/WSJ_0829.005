   The U.S. freeze of Iraqi assets has put some small
companies on a roller coaster.
   On Aug. 1, as Iraqi soldiers were massing on Kuwait's
border, a Greek freighter slipped its moorings in
Philadelphia, sailed down the Delaware River and into the
Atlantic. In the freighter's cargo holds was $12.1 million of
tire-making equipment from an Akron, Ohio, company,
NRM-Steelastic Inc., destined for Iraq.

   The next day Iraq's troops invaded Kuwait, and President
Bush imposed a trade embargo and asset freeze on Iraq. But
NRM-Steelastic's shipment, then on the high seas, narrowly
escaped the freeze. That's because the company held an
irrevocable letter of credit with the Bank of New York
guaranteeing payment of $12.1 million as soon as the company
received a shipboard bill of lading and the vessel was under
way.
   Had the Iraq-bound ship been scheduled to sail 24 hours
later, after the invasion had begun, NRM-Steelastic doubts it
would have left port. The company's equipment and the $12.1
million payment would have been frozen. "It truly was good
luck," says NRM-Steelastic's Chairman John Vazzana.
   That's the good news.
   The company also has $19 million of additional machinery
pending under the same contract with Iraq's Ministry of Heavy
Industry. Much of this equipment has already been produced,
but it can't be shipped because of the asset freeze. The
remaining order accounts for nearly one-sixth of
NRM-Steelastic's $120 million backlog. "I think it's safe to
say that this is going to hurt our earnings by 15% to 20% for
the year. That's very painful," says Mr. Vazzana, adding: "We
have no employees in Iraq, thank God."
   War can play havoc with large and small companies trying
to earn a profit on foreign trade. Diversified big companies
can often absorb a trade-related loss that might cripple
smaller companies.
   It's unclear how many companies have been burned by
sanctions stemming from the Persian Gulf crisis. But the buzz
of activity around the Treasury Department's office of
foreign assets control, which is reviewing requests from U.S.
companies for relief from effects of the asset freeze,
indicates that a number of U.S. companies are being affected.
   "Their lines are busy every time I call," says Ronald
Soberay, executive vice president of Cleveland-based Soberay
Machine Equipment Co. "We finally sent them a letter." His
company, a supplier along with NRM-Steelastic to a nearly
completed Iraqi truck-tire factory, had crates full of
controls for rubber-mixing machinery sitting on a pier in
Newport News, Va., when the freeze was imposed. The machinery
is still there.
   Counting the Aug. 1 shipment, NRM-Steelastic has so far
sent $30 million of tire-building machines and curing presses
to the factory near Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad. The
assembly plant, engineered by Britain's Dunlop Holdings PLC
and under construction for two years, will have a capacity of
167,000 tires a month, nearly doubling Iraq's
tire-manufacturing potential.
   Meanwhile, NRM-Steelastic is holding the bag for the
undelivered part of the Iraqi order. "The entire $19 million
is in limbo," says Mr. Vazzana. "We're diverting some of the
equipment to other companies and basically trying to deal
with the situation."
   The Iraqi crisis also puts a cloud over NRM-Steelastic's
first public stock offering. The company has been counting on
raising about $40 million through a 3.3 million-share
offering in September. Mr. Vazzana's assessment after a
telephone conference this week with the company's investment
adviser, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette: "We haven't given up
hope. We're going to look at where we stand after Labor Day."
   Privately held NRM-Steelastic had sales of $117 million in
the fiscal year ended March 31, up from $100 million and $62
million in the previous two years. Nearly 90% of its business
is related to tire manufacturing and about half of its sales
are exports. Foreign trade is "the heartbeat of our company,"
Mr. Vazzana says.
   In Cleveland, Mr. Soberay and his brother, Thaddeus,
co-owners of the small Soberay rubber processing equipment
company, say they are amazed to be getting daily telex
messages from Iraq inquiring: "When are your people going to
be here? When is the shipment going to arrive?"
   Ronald Soberay adds: "We just look at each other and shrug
our shoulders." The frozen shipment, valued at about
$600,000, was the final component of Soberay's $10.5 million
contract with the Najaf factory. "We're not happy about it,
but it could be worse," says Thaddeus Soberay.
   Asked for his advice to small companies exporting to
politically volatile regions, NRM-Steelastic's Mr. Vazzana
says, "You always do business on an irrevocable letter of
credit confirmed on a U.S. bank. It surely saved us from a
very bad debt situation."
   In hindsight, Mr. Vazzana says even safer would be tying
export financing to a truck bill of lading, meaning payment
is guaranteed when a shipment leaves a plant's loading dock.
   As for the tire-making machinery in the Greek freighter,
Mr. Vazzana says, "My understanding is they're pulling into a
Greek port and they're going to sit there until they figure
out what to do."
