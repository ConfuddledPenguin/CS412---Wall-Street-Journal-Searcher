   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. is expected to announce today the
appointment of Johnathan Rodgers as president of the division
that runs the television stations the broadcasting company
owns.
   Mr. Rodgers is general manager of WBBM, the CBS-owned
station in Chicago. He would succeed Eric Ober, who was named
president of CBS News last week, succeeding David W. Burke,
who was fired.

   Prior to joining WBBM in 1986, Mr. Rodgers was executive
producer of the "CBS Morning News" and of the weekend edition
of the "CBS Evening News."
   Speculation here late yesterday was that Paul Sagan, news
director of WCBS in New York, would succeed Mr. Rodgers. CBS
declined to comment on either of the executives.
   CBS owns five television stations, which have total annual
revenue exceeding $400 million.
