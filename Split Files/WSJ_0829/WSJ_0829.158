   PATTEN Corp. (Stamford, Vt.) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
said it lowered its rating on this land sales company's
subordinated debt to triple-C-minus from triple-C-plus,
citing "continued poor performance." The rating concern also
removed Patten's subordinated debt from its CreditWatch list,
where it was placed July 9. The rating downgrade affects
about $35 million of convertible subordinated debentures, S&amp;P
said, adding that Patten's implied senior rating is
triple-C-plus. S&amp;P said Patten "continues to be plagued by
declining sales in its two primary selling regions, New
England and the mid-Atlantic states. This poor performance is
expected to continue, as demand for raw land in these regions
is very weak." Patten's land inventory of $69 million as of
April 1 "remains burdensome," S&amp;P said; furthermore, Patten
is in violation of some of its financial covenants with
banks, potentially resulting in "debt acceleration." It said
Patten's "liquidity and financial flexibility are poor and
unlikely to improve over the short term." President Harry S.
Patten said that the company isn't in violation of its bank
covenants, and that it "is rapidly reducing inventory in the
Northeast" and expects to have sold most of it by the end of
the third quarter. He said that margins on the Northeast
sales "are way below normal," but that Patten's "good margins
in other parts of the country should offset" this.

   QUANTUM CHEMICAL Corp. (New York) -- Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. lowered its ratings on $2.1 billion of the company's
long-term debt, downgrading senior debt to single-B-plus and
subordinated debt to single-B-minus. The rating agency cited
the increased likelihood of a protracted downturn in the
commodity chemical cycle, as well as the risk of sharply
increased prices for petrochemical raw materials due to the
Middle East crisis.
