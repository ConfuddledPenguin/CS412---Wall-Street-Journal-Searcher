   LOS ANGELES -- A state court jury here ordered Foothill
Thrift &amp; Loan to pay $564,000 in damages to Videoscope Inc.
and certain of its principals for "breach of fiduciary duty"
and "unjust enrichment."
   Videoscope, a closely held renter of surveillance cameras,
said that its secured creditor, Foothill, kept more money
than it should have after taking over Videoscope when that
company couldn't pay its debts to Foothill in 1985.

   Foothill "stole and kept money that it wasn't entitled
to," said Allan Browne, an attorney who represented two
Videoscope investors. The jury awarded the damages to
Videoscope and to its two principals, Bernard C. Lurie and J.
Bud Morris.
   The jury didn't award damages to Mr. Browne's clients, who
were passive investors. "They will recover directly from
Videoscope as stockholders," the attorney said.
   A spokesman for Foothill Group Inc., parent of Foothill
Thrift &amp; Loan, said the company was "pleased" with the
verdict because the award was substantially less than the $25
million sought, separately, by Videoscope and its principals
and by the investors.
   "We're uncertain whether we'll appeal," the spokesman
said.
   Foothill has spent about $1 million in legal costs and
related fees since the case was filed in 1986, the spokesman
said. Foothill said it hopes to recover a portion of those
costs from the passive investors. Their attorney, Mr. Browne,
said he believes that hope is "a fantasy."
