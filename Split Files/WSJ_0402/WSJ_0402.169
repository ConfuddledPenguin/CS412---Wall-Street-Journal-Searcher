   DALLAS -- In one of the first major leveraged buy-outs
since the UAL Corp. deal fell apart in October 1989, the
Dallas investment firm Hicks, Muse &amp; Co. completed the cash
purchase of seven I.C.H. Corp. insurance companies for $530
million.
   After fees and closing costs, I.C.H. should receive about
$495 million from the deal. The Louisville, Ky.-based
insurance company said it will use about $345 million to
reduce outstanding bank debt. Analysts said the deal will
help improve I.C.H.'s financial situation. At the end of the
third quarter, the company had stockholders equity of $664
million and liabilities of about $8.9 billion.

   Separately, I.C.H. reported a 1989 loss of $255.2 million,
or $5.30 a share, compared with net income of $5.8 million
for 1988. The loss included write-downs of about $262.5
million from investments in First Executive Corp. stock and
junk bonds of Southmark Corp. and Integrated Resources Inc.
   I.C.H. held about 20% of the common stock of First
Executive, a Los Angeles insurer that in turn had invested in
hundreds of millions of dollars of junk bonds. The First
Executive, Southmark and Integrated Resources investments
accounted for somewhere between 10% and 15% of I.C.H.'s
investment portfolio, according to Herbert Goodfriend,
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   "The closing of this transaction is another step in the
process of refocusing the growth plans of I.C.H.," said
I.C.H. Chairman Robert T. Shaw. Company officials weren't
available for further comment.
   In the buy-out transaction, newly formed Life Partners
Group Inc. will buy Philadelphia Life Insurance Co.,
Massachusetts General Life Insurance Co., Wabash Life
Insurance Co. and three smaller companies from I.C.H. The
companies have total assets of $2.2 billion. The deal, which
was financed with about 20% equity and 80% debt, involved no
public debt and no junk bonds, said Thomas O. Hicks, chairman
of Hicks, Muse.
   Investors in the new company are Hicks, Muse Equity Fund,
with about 60% of the equity; Wand Investments, a joint
venture between S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. and Bruce W. Schnitzer,
with about 9%; GE Capital Corp. with about 15%; and senior
management and other institutional investors with the
remaining equity. GE also provided the senior debt and
mezzanine financing. After two years, GE could exercise
warrants that would give it a total equity position of about
30%.
   Along with the insurance operations, Life Partners will
acquire some top managers of I.C.H., including former
president John Gardiner. "These guys were the true operating
management and if left unattended at I.C.H., they would have
done a more effective job at consolidating the operations" of
the various life insurance companies, said Mr. Goodfriend,
the analyst. "Under this management, they {Life Partners}
have a good chance at making it work."
   Mr. Hicks said that although he doesn't believe his deal
signals a new wave of publicly funded highly leveraged deals,
the opportunity to do well-financed deals is increasing.
"Prices are in the process of adjusting to the new realities"
of the current financing market, he said. "We think it's a
good time to make acquisitions, if you can get good
financing."
   The only other large leveraged buy-out in the past six
months was the March Forstmann Little &amp; Co. purchase of the
Gulfstream Aerospace unit of Chrysler Corp. for $825 million.
   The leveraged buy-out of the I.C.H. companies was
possible, says Mr. Hicks, because the transaction wasn't
overpriced and didn't require public financing. "We're buying
these businesses for six times cash flow," said Mr. Hicks.
"The problem with the LBO industry has been that prices got
to the level of nine to 10 times cash flow and they were
overleveraged."
   Mr. Hicks said he avoided the leveraged buy-out business
through 1988 and 1989 because of the high prices. "We chose
not to participate in that market," he said, other than to
sell some of his investment portfolio into the high-priced
market.
   Mr. Hicks said he and his partners in Hicks, Muse Equity
Fund will probably continue to add insurance companies to
their portfolio to take advantage of the consolidation in the
life insurance industry.
