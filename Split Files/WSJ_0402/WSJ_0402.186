   NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp. said first-quarter
results will be reduced by a $52 million pretax charge for
expenses stemming from the previously announced move to cut
1,100 jobs and other cost-saving steps.
   The after-tax effect of the charge is expected to be about
$40 million, according to securities analysts. The company
didn't specify the charge after taxes.

   Analysts had been expecting Chemical to post first-quarter
earnings of about $144 million, or $1.75 a share, including
the gain from the sale of its stake in Florida National Banks
of Florida Inc. to First Union Corp. Analysts expect the sale
will produce an after-tax gain of about $80 million for
Chemical.
   James J. McDermott, research director of Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods Inc., said, "With the gain from Florida National, this
was a good time for Chemical to take the charge."
   Chemical's slimming down was prompted by two special
additions to its loan-loss reserves in last year's third
quarter: a $600 million provision for Latin American debt and
a $300 million for provision to readjust values of real
estate held by Chemical's Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc.
subsidiary.
   As a result, Chemical had a loss of $482.2 million, or
$8.29 a share, last year.
   The elimination of 1,100 jobs is a somewhat sharper cut
than the estimate the company gave in February, when it said
it planned to cut 900 jobs in the first quarter. No
explanation was given for the higher number. Chemical now has
about 29,000 employees world-wide.
   The staff reductions are expected to save Chemical about
$60 million on an annualized basis, though the bank wouldn't
estimate the net savings for this year.
   In addition to pruning its work force, Chemical said it
consolidated certain branches and by midyear will relocate
headquarters and staff of its Chemical Bank New Jersey
subisidiary from several locations in Morristown, N.J., to a
single site in East Brunswick, N.J.
   Keefe's Mr. McDermott said that "Chemical has actually
done a pretty good job of expense control. Their expenses
totaled $2.6 billion last year. Expenses have been about flat
since 1987, and since then they've acquired a New Jersey
bank."
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chemical dropped 37.5 cents to $23.375.
