   Philips Industries Inc. said it will take a pretax charge
of $45 million to $50 million for the year ended Saturday.
   The Dayton, Ohio, maker of motorhome and housing parts
said it will take an additional pretax charge of as much as
$12 million if a merger agreement with a group formed by
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc., a unit of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co., is terminated.

   The group has been unable to obtain financing for the
proposed offer of $700 million, or $24 a share.
   Philips also said it is providing certain information to
another party that has indicated possible interest in a
transaction with Philips. The company said neither Merrill
Lynch nor any other party has made any new proposals to
Philips.
   The company also said it will sell the following
subsidiaries: Shelby Advanced Automotive Technology Inc.,
Mid-West Conveyor Co., Dearborn Fabricating &amp; Engineering Co.
Shelby makes aluminum wheels for autos, while the other two
make heavy conveyors for the auto industry.
