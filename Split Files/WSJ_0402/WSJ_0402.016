   Eastman Kodak Co., still ailing from lower profit margins
despite measures last year to cut costs, is expected to
report another quarter of reduced profit.
   Most analysts in the past two weeks have dropped
first-quarter earnings estimates to 50 cents a share for the
photographic, chemical and pharmaceutical concern. In the
year-ago period, Kodak earned $200 million, or 62 cents a
share, on sales of $3.9 billion.

   "Our assumption was that there was going to be a snap back
of margins from cost savings," said analyst Alex B. Henderson
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. But "it's a continuation
of last year's difficulties."
   Kodak, which won't report its results until May 2, refuses
to comment on analysts' profit projections. But the company
has maintained that much of the cost-cutting measures taken
late last year won't bolster results until later this year.
"We've said all along that our restructuring will be felt in
the second half," a company spokesman said.
   Last August, after six-month net income slid 60%, Kodak
announced its fourth restructuring plan since 1983. Under the
latest plan, the company said it would divest itself of 20
businesses and eliminate about 5,000 jobs in the U.S. to
generate as much as $1 billion in cash flow this year.
   So far, the company has divested itself of its minilab
products and overhead projector business and closed its
professional videotape businesses, among others. The company
two weeks ago also sold its floppy disk unit, the largest
business yet to be sold under its restructuring effort.
Analysts estimate the unit was sold for about $200 million,
for an estimated pretax gain of $25 million.
   Most of the businesses sold or closed were in the
information systems group, which has been hurt by high
administrative costs. For 1989, the business group was barely
profitable, generating operating profit of $57 million before
charges on sales of $4.2 billion. Analysts foresee little
improvement in the group's business outlook this year.
   Moreover, sectors that had been strong, such as Kodak's
chemical group, are coming under greater pressure from the
weak economy. Operating profit is expected to fall 25% this
year.
   Adding to first-quarter woes has been the relative
strength of the dollar overseas, particularly in Japan.
Besides making Kodak exports more expensive in overseas
markets, the strong dollar also lowers foreign currency
earnings. Sales overseas represented about 43% of total sales
for Kodak last year.
   The company notes, however, that demand for consumer
photographic film -- Kodak's cash cow -- continues strong
despite the company's higher than normal price increase last
December. "Price increases have been accepted by the market,"
said analyst Donald Zwyer of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He
estimates the price increase will contribute about half of
the sales gain in Kodak's imaging segment.
