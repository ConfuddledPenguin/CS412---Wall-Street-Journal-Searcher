   The Bundesbank's proposal for a 2-to-1 conversion rate for
East German marks into West German marks triggered an uproar
in East Germany.
   The recommendation by Bundesbank President Karl-Otto Poehl
at a meeting of European Community finance ministers and
central bank governors in Galway, Ireland, marked a retreat
from pledges made by West German leaders during recent East
German elections. Mr. Poehl said a 1-to-1 conversion rate
should be limited to a maximum 2,000 marks per East German
citizen. The rest of East German savings, debt and wages
would be converted at the rate of two East marks for one West
German mark. A West German mark has a value of 59 U.S. cents
at current exchange rates.

   Furious East Berlin officials warned that anything less
than a broadly implemented 1-for-1 rate would impoverish most
East German wage earners and even hinder the unification of
the two Germanys. Leaders of the major East German parties
joined together over the weekend to reject the plan, and East
German Premier Hans Modrow said in a newspaper interview the
proposal has already stirred widespread unrest in the East
German population. He insisted that West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and other Bonn officials had promised East German
savers a 1-for-1 rate in the run-up to East Germany's March
18 election, which resulted in a landside victory for
Bonn-supported conservatives.
   "The election result was the result of these promises, and
nothing else," Mr. Modrow declared. The head of the caretaker
government insisted that East Germans had interpreted the
promises as having a broad application, including wages.
   Mr. Modrow warned that Bonn would be held responsible for
any strikes or demonstrations that might result from the
apparent policy shift. Officials for the East German
Christian Democrats reported that their East Berlin
headquarters was flooded with calls from angry citizens.
   Rainer Eppelmann, head of the Democratic Awakening party,
one of the three East German parties making up the CDU-led
conservative alliance, predicted a fresh wave of emigration
to West Germany.
   The proposal unsettled Mr. Kohl's allies back in Bonn.
Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democratic Party, the
junior partner in the Bonn government coalition, told a
newspaper the proposal could be seen as "a breach of faith."
   East Germans can now buy West German marks at a subsidized
rate of one for each three East marks. Monetary officials
calculate the East mark's true purchasing power suggests a
rate of 4.4 to one. Even a 2-to-1 rate would be a vast
improvement for East German workers, they say.
   While the West German government hasn't accepted the
2-for-1 proposal, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said it was
"economically and financially well founded" and that it
couldn't be ignored, while Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann called the recommendation an "important decision"
that wouldn't inflict economic harm on East Germans.
   While unpopular among the populace, a 2-for-1 rate would
be a boon to highly indebted East German state companies,
which wouldn't have to use as much hard currency to pay off
debts, and would make East German companies more competitive
with Western ones. Such a rate would also be less
inflationary.
