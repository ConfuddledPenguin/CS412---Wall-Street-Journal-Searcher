   An investor has decided to solicit proxies to nominate and
elect James H. McGuire, Charles J. Mitchell Jr. and Edward E.
Strickland to Reuter Inc.'s board.
   Richard P. Davisson, a New York broker and holder of 12.5%
of Reuter common stock, asked Messrs. McGuire, Mitchell and
Strickland to be a part of a slate that he hopes is elected
at the annual meeting. Mr. Strickland is a director but his
seat is up for re-election this year.

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr.
Davisson said he contacted Reuter of Hopkins, Minn., earlier
in the month to ask that the board include a majority of
independent directors. He said the maker of computer parts
and plastic-refuse containers hasn't responded.
   In October, Mr. Davisson agreed that until March 15, he
wouldn't solicit proxies in opposition to Reuter's board.
That agreement resulted in an expansion of Reuter's board to
nine members and the appointment of James W. Taylor, whose
election Mr. Davisson had sought.
   Mr. McGuire is chairman of Intercim Corp., a Minneapolis
factory-automation concern. Mr. Mitchell is president of
Hayden/Wegman Inc., a New York environmental-engineering
firm. Mr. Strickland is a Wyzetta, Minn., financial
consultant.
   Officials for Reuter weren't available for comment.
