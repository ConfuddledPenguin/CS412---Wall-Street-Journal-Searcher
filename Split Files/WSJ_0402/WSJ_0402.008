   Your March 13 article on James Brady says the former White
House press secretary "makes a poignant personal point" by
comparing the inconvenience of gun owners' facing waiting
periods with his own inconvenience and pain resulting from
the head wound caused by John Hinckley's bullet.
   The so-called "Brady Bill," however, would not have
stopped Hinckley's attack on President Reagan, and if it
becomes law it will not stop future assassins or other
gun-toting criminals. Despite your claims, Mr. Brady brings
no "new dimension" to the highly polarized debate on gun
control. Emotion has long been an ally of the falsehoods and
distortions that are the stock and trade of Mr. Brady's
wife's group, Handgun Control Inc.

   Gun-control schemes promoted by people ignorant about and
hostile to firearms may enjoy better prospects of passage
today than in the past, but they enjoy no greater chance of
affecting criminal violence. To develop regulations that
really would have an effect, lawmakers need to avoid the
battle between the NRA and HCI by seeking the support and
collaboration of honest gun owners for restrictions that
respect their own rights while targeting those who criminally
misuse firearms. The NRA and its membership would rally
behind such efforts, but they would not satisfy the
self-righteousness and cultural bigotry of the HCI crusaders.

   You say many U.S.-made assault weapons are exported to
drug lords in Colombia and elsewhere. The drug lords, in
fact, are not interested in U.S.-made semiautomatic arms, but
prefer full automatic weapons, which they easily purchase
from many sources in Europe and Asia or occasionally steal
from local police and military forces. I've spent much time
in these areas on legitimate business and am not speaking
from secondhand knowledge.
   This "Colombian drug lord" gambit is simply the latest of
a long line of cliches foisted on the public by the
gun-control crowd to achieve its purposes.

   While the NRA is a very efficient lobby in Congress, it is
second to none in its ability to inform its members of any
attempt to weaken constitutional rights. Not only does it
inform its members, but through media attention brought to
its tactics it also informs the public at large and allows
citizens to consider both sides of the issue before voting
their convictions. The politicians know this. They also know
it is rarely beneficial to be on the side of an issue
supported by the minority opinion.
