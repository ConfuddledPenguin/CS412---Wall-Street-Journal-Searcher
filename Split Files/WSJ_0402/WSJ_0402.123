   This week for the first time, futures trading opens in an
"invisible" commodity that many use but none ever see --
natural gas.
   The new futures contract, under study for several years,
begins trading at 9:20 a.m. EDT tomorrow on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.

   The contract unit will be 10 billion British thermal units
-- about 10 million cubic feet. Prices will be in dollars per
million BTUs, or about 1,000 cubic feet. The delivery point
will be Louisiana's Henry Hub gas interchange operated by
Texaco Inc.'s Sabine Pipe Line subsidiary. Dedication
ceremonies tomorrow at the interchange near Erath, La., will
coincide with the opening of trading.
   The New York Merc already offers futures trading in crude
oil, heating oil, gasoline, propane and residual fuel. But on
the eve of the gas futures' debut, there still are some who
object to it. These include some smaller producers worried
about the impact on pricing of actions by speculators and
other outsiders not familiar with the industry's risks.
   But similar objections were voiced before the start of
trading in petroleum futures, which have since reshaped world
oil markets. Proponents of the new fuel contract predict a
similar restructuring of the ways natural gas is bought and
sold.
   "It will have a snowball effect on the business," says
John E. Olson, a leading proponent of gas futures trading.
   Mr. Olson, a Houston-based natural gas analyst for First
Boston Corp., calls the contract an idea whose time is
overdue. "This will provide a transparent pricing mechanism
for gas and will allow arbitrage against residual fuel," he
said.
   Gas's main competitor, residual fuel, has drawn little
interest on the Nymex. But total trading in the crude oil
contract, which has made West Texas Intermediate something of
a household term in much of the country, routinely exceeds
the volume of all the oil the world actually produces.
   Few are willing to make predictions of trading volume in
the untried gas futures market. Some oil futures traders
suggest it could eventually match that of crude oil on a BTU
or dollar basis. They see a big potential for gas because
around 80% of the 18.8 trillion cubic feet used last year in
the U.S. was sold on the spot market or through short-term
contracts, leaving only 20% for long-term contracts.
   "The gas market is huge, there is increased emphasis on
gas because of the Clean Air Act and environmental concerns,
and the number of players is larger than for oil," says Lance
Schneier, chairman of Access Energy Corp., a leading gas
marketer.
   Gas prices -- currently around $1.50 per 1,000 cubic feet
at the well-head in Texas -- have been relatively flat for
the past three years even as oil prices bounced back from
their 1986 collapse. But demand for gas has been growing, and
the renewed interest in the clean-burning fuel already may
have eliminated the surplus that has plagued the industry for
several years.
   Still, there are tests for gas to pass before its position
in futures markets can be assured. Not the least is the
industry's "ability to fulfill a contract with the physical
delivery of the commodity at a specified location at a
specified price" at all times, says Nicholas Bush, president
of the Natural Gas Supply Association.
   Contracts will be traded for 12 consecutive months, and
delivery is to be made over the course of the delivery month.
But some others also question sellers' abilities to deliver
during periods such as last December's cold wave, when
pipelines were operating at maximum.
   If oil futures are any guide, actual deliveries of gas are
likely to be minimal. A Nymex spokeswoman says less than 1%
of the oil traded is actually delivered. Nevertheless, such
operational considerations will remain a concern until gas's
futures system is thoroughly tested.
   "Gas is not like soybeans or corn," says Alan Anderson,
president of Energy Planning Inc., a gas market research
firm. "We are waiting to see how well it will work
physically."
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

                          Copper
                                                                                                       

   The copper market usually slows down in April as demand
tapers off, but it should start this month roaring.
   On Friday, the May futures contract rose to a fresh
life-of-contract high of $1.227 a pound before easing
slightly to end at $1.224, up 4.50 cents.
   Driving prices higher were a wildcat walkout by workers at
the Highland Valley copper mine in British Columbia, which
was out for 3 1/2 months last year in a similar dispute over
using outside workers, and a second mine strike in Peru.
Highland Valley annually produces 160,000 tons of
concentrates containing about 30% copper.
   An injunction was expected to end the Highland Valley
walkout, but workers at the Tintaya mine in Peru went out on
an indefinite strike over wages Friday, analysts said.
   Tintaya produces just over 11% of Peru's copper. Southern
Peru Copper Corp., whose miners and smelter workers have been
on strike since March 12, produces about 64% of that
country's copper, meaning slightly more than 75% of Peru's
copper capacity is currently shut down. Peru is the world's
sixth largest copper producer.
   There were reports that workers at the Ok Tedi mine in
Papua New Guinea had gone out on strike, but they couldn't be
confirmed, analysts said. The mine produces 230,000 tons of
concentrates. Papua New Guinea is also the site of the
Bougainville copper mine, with a capacity of about 600,000
tons of concentrates annually, which has been idled since
last May because of attacks by native landowners.
   Supplies may shrink even further. London Metal Exchange
copper inventory data today are expected to show a drop of
several thousand tons.
   Copper's resurgence has nothing to do with the world
economy but is being caused by factors within the industry,
one analyst said.
   "That means if the current problems are solved and demand
slumps because of slower economic conditions, prices could
still turn lower later in the year, in line with most
predictions," he said.
                                                                                                       

                          Cotton
                                                                                                       

   While greater export sales and shipments of cotton buoyed
prices late last week, a plantings report released Friday may
temper the bullish trend.
   The May contract Friday ended with a gain of 0.58 cent to
72.70 cents a pound.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said after trading
ended Friday that about 12.4 million acres will be planted
with cotton in the U.S. for harvest in the season beginning
Aug. 1, up from 10.6 million in the current season.
   Based on average yields, this acreage could produce 14.5
million to 15.7 million bales of cotton, compared with 12.2
million bales this season.
   However, an analyst said the report might not affect
futures much, because the increase had been expected. He also
said contracts for later months that would be directly
affected by the size of the next season's acreage are already
priced at significant discounts to the earlier contracts.
