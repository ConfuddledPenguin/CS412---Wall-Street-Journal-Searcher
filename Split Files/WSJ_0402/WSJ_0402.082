   MIAMI -- General Development Corp. said it delayed its
annual stockholders' meeting in Miami from May 4 until June
1. The community developer said the change was because of a
delay in the preparation of audited financial statements.
   The new record date for stockholders eligible to vote at
the meeting is next Monday, the company said.
