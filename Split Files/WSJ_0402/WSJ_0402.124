   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund warned
Liberia that it is facing expulsion from the 152-nation
organization because of its $395.3 million in loan arrears.
   The IMF executive board on Friday approved a "declaration
of non-cooperation" that could lead to the removal of Liberia
from the IMF by Aug. 30, unless it "resumes active
cooperation" with the IMF in resolving its overdue
obligations.

   IMF officials said this was the first time the IMF has
adopted such a policy declaration involving a member country
with overdue loan payments. The IMF soon may issue a similar
warning to the Sudan, which is about $1.2 billion in arrears
on its IMF loans.
   The IMF said Liberia has "persisted in its failure to
fulfill it obligations" to the IMF, although it has made
payments to other creditors.
