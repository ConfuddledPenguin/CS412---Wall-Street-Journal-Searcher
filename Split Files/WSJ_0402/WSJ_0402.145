   WASHINGTON -- The Consumer Federation of America and a
group of big telecommunications users blasted the Bell
companies' assertion that the U.S. is fast becoming a
second-rate telecommunications power.
   A study prepared for the two groups by Economics and
Technology Inc. of Boston concluded that the Bells' claim "is
little more than a transparent fiction" and that the U.S. is
still far ahead of such competitors as France, West Germany,
Japan and the United Kingdom. Moreover, it said, the U.S.
phone companies are upgrading their networks at a realistic,
rapid pace.

   Nevertheless, the study said, the seven regional Bell
companies have engaged in a disinformation campaign, stirring
up concerns about slippage in global competitiveness, to
convince Congress to lift restrictions that bar them from
long-distance and information services, and from
manufacturing telecommunications equipment.
   The study could play an important role in the
congressional debate over whether the Bell companies should
be freed of some restrictions in the consent decree that
broke up the Bell system.
   The Bell companies countered that the Consumer Federation
and the International Communications Association, a group of
big corporate telecommunications users, were misguided. A.
Gray Collins, senior vice president for external affairs at
Bell Atlantic Corp. called the review a "fairy tale."
   The study, Mr. Collins said, "focuses on the state of
plain old telephone service instead of our country's need for
major network improvements to make information services
available to all." Japan, France and others, he said, "are
leapfrogging us." A spokesman for Denver-based U S West Inc.
said the Bells "aren't alarmists. We're realists."
   Major measures of telephone service quality prove U.S.
network superiority, the study found. For instance, fewer
than 1% of the calls placed on the Bell networks are blocked,
compared with 2.5% in France, 2.2% in the U.K., and 1.2% in
Germany. In the U.S., the vast majority of phone customers
can get Touch Tone service. In France, 50% of the access
lines have tone signaling, and even fewer in Japan.
Furthermore, it said, most other countries have yet to
develop 800 service.
   The study took particular issue with Bell company data
showing that Japan, Singapore, Western European countries and
Canada are spending more per access line than the Bell
companies to upgrade their networks. Once adjusted to reflect
outlays for customers' phone equipment, long-distance
communications and other investments the Bell companies don't
make because the U.S. industry is structured differently, the
rate of Bells' capital spending exceeded that of most
countries, Economics &amp; Technology found. Only Singapore,
which has embarked on a major network modernization program,
spent more.
   "The regional Bell companies and other local exchange
carriers are rapidly modernizing their networks today," the
study concluded. While some might believe they are spending
too much, the study said, "there is no basis for assuming
that the companies are spending too little."
