   LONDON -- BTR PLC said it filed suit in federal court in
Boston to have Norton Co.'s canceled annual meeting
reinstated for April 26.
   Norton, target of an unsolicited $1.64 billion bid by BTR,
a London-based international conglomerate, on Thursday
canceled its annual meeting and scheduled a special
shareholders' meeting for June 26. Norton, a Worcester,
Mass.-based chemical and abrasives maker, said it needed more
time to weigh alternatives to BTR's bid, which it also
rejected as inadequate.

   "If we get the date reinstated, we'll start our proxy
fight quite soon," said John C. Cahill, BTR chief executive
officer, in a telephone interview. BTR had given Norton until
Friday to accept its offer or face a possible proxy fight.
But if the June 26 special meeting date were allowed to
stand, Mr. Cahill indicated, any proxy fight wouldn't begin
for some weeks.
   In arguing that the annual meeting should proceed April 26
as scheduled, BTR noted that Norton's corporate bylaws state
that the annual meeting be held on the fourth Thursday in
April and that "no change in the date of the annual meeting
of stockholders may be made within 60 days before the date
fixed in these bylaws."
   BTR contended that Norton's board has tried to get around
the bylaws "by `cancelling' the annual meeting and
resurrecting it in the form of a `special meeting,' " but
that such a change is "impermissible."
   In response to BTR's request for an expedited hearing on
the annual-meeting issue, the court scheduled a hearing for
April 6.
   BTR's suit also asks the court to declare null Norton's
shareholder-rights plan and to declare that certain
anti-takeover laws of the state of Massachusetts are
inapplicable in the Norton takeover fight.
   Norton said it would "vigorously oppose" the BTR suit, and
filed its own suit in federal court in Boston seeking to
enjoin BTR's tender offer and to stop BTR from soliciting
proxies. Norton charged that BTR has violated federal
securities laws by, among other things, failing to disclose
"its practice and pattern of closing or moving plants and
laying off workers after various acquisitions it has made."
   The BTR chief executive said Norton's rejection of the bid
"was a very weak response." He added: "Norton made no
reference to shareholder value, and there is no expectation
that Norton can do anything short-term or medium-term" to
improve the company's operating prospects.
   Mr. Cahill urged Norton's board to provide BTR and other
Norton holders with whatever information it used to conclude
that BTR's bid was inadequate. BTR owns a fractional stake in
Norton. Mr. Cahill noted that before BTR made its $75-a-share
bid last month, Norton's share price never had exceeded $64
in the company's 105-year history.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Norton closed at $73.50, down 37.5 cents.
   Mr. Cahill said he expected to meet Massachusetts Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry in Washington, D.C., this
week to try to defuse political opposition to BTR's bid. "We
want to sit down in a spirit of good will and explain the
benefits of the bid to Norton and to the city of
Worcester," Mr. Cahill said.
   He also said BTR would run Norton "as a free-standing,
independent company" using Norton's current management.
   He held out the possibility that BTR might make capital
investments in Norton. Norton's capital investments "went
flat in the last four years, and I don't know why," he said.
"Perhaps it was because of poor cash flow."
