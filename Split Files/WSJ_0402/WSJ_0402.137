   HOUSTON -- American General Corp. said it was notified by
a Torchmark Corp. unit of its intent to nominate a slate for
American General's board.
   The notice, contained in a letter from Torchmark's Liberty
National Life Insurance Co., appears to confirm rumors that
the Birmingham, Ala., insurer intends to press its hostile
bid for American General in a proxy fight, American General
said.

   But American General said it plans to inform Liberty
National that it missed the deadline to nominate a slate.
American General last week filed a lawsuit in federal court
here asking a judge to uphold a company bylaw that requires
shareholders to notify the company at least 60 days before a
shareholders meeting if they plan to nominate directors.
   An American General spokesman said he didn't know if the
letter, which was received Saturday evening, contained the
names of specific Torchmark nominees. But he said the letter
indicated Torchmark intends to nominate five people for the
six seats that come up for election at the annual meeting May
2.
   Last week, Torchmark made a surprise offer to acquire
American General for $50 a share in cash and stock, or more
than $6 billion. American General said its board plans to
consider the offer at its regular meeting after the
shareholders meeting.
   Torchmark couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
