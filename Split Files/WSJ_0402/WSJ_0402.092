   Russia's money needs are becoming more desperate, and
therein lies a tricky problem for the West. So long as the
Soviets need -- and are able to get -- Western financing,
they are more apt to show forbearance in dealing with
sensitive political problems, such as Lithuanian secession.
They will be reluctant to endanger their ties with the West.
But if their Western financing dries up, their behavior
becomes more problematic.
   On the other hand, if the West continues to finance the
Soviet economy, its needs could become a serious drain on
world capital markets. Pouring money into non-productive
enterprises is bad banking, and the Soviet command economy is
sinking ever lower from an already low level of production.

   If the Soviets are unable to pay their debts to Western
banks they will add to an already sizable pile of troubled
debt -- that run up by less developed countries and the U.S.
savings and loan industry, for example. Bad debt is economic
waste, and thus a drag on the world economy. Such waste feeds
inflation and inhibits economic growth. Use of tax money by
Western governments to finance the Soviets also makes little
sense. By raising tax burdens, that too would slow productive
growth.
   In short, the Soviets, always a military threat, now are
becoming an economic threat as well. A nation stretching
around nearly half of the northern part of the globe is
sinking into an economic abyss. Its 280 million people are
not producing enough to provide themselves with adequate
necessities, let alone contribute anything to the world's
supply of capital and wealth. Rising discontent further
diminishes productivity.
   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin said last week
that there is no sign of an easing of the decline in energy
and industrial output caused by strikes and political
turmoil. In the first two months of this year, oil production
was off 4% from a year earlier and coal production off 6%.
Earlier it had been reported that man-days lost to strikes
and conflicts rose to 9.1 in the first two months from 7.3 a
year before. It is not entirely clear what that statistic
means but it seems to indicate that the U.S.S.R. lost some
20% to 25% of its labor capacity, obviously a serious matter.
   The Soviets have had a continuing debate over whether they
should borrow more in the West to finance purchases of
consumer goods. As Keith Bush of Radio Liberty wrote on these
pages recently, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov last year
appeared to exaggerate the size of the Soviet external debt,
perhaps to discourage further borrowing to fill store
shelves. But he now appears to have lost the debate.
   Nikolai Petrakov, Mikhail Gorbachev's chief economic
advisor and the lead designer of yet another planned economic
reform, dropped a hint about foreign borrowing in a recent
interview with Interfax, a semi-official Soviet news agency.
He stressed how important it will be for President Gorbachev
and his new cabinet to "retain the confidence of the
population" as the new reform inflicts economic pain. He was
presumably referring to layoffs and maybe higher prices.
   "It would be good, of course, if to achieve this we could
make use of foreign credits offered to us on easy terms,"
said Mr. Petrakov, adding that the Soviet Union "ought to
enter all the international economic organizations." In other
words, the Soviets would like to get into any organization
that has money to lend.
   That hint is being confirmed by other reliable sources in
Western Europe. They say the Soviets are gearing up for a
borrowing offensive. The question will be whether to finance
or not finance their consumption needs.
   At least one Westerner of some note may already have made
up his mind on that question. U.S. Treasury Under Secretary
David Mulford told a Senate hearing a few days ago that the
U.S. would not join the proposed European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) if the Soviets are
given full borrowing access. Western private banks also are
taking a more jaundiced view of Soviet credits, mainly
because of mounting Soviet debt payment arrears, which are
said to be approaching $1 billion. A 500 Deutsche mark ($300
million) Soviet bond issue met with a cool reception on the
London market in January. Keith Bush quoted a West German
banker as saying that the Soviet credit rating had
deteriorated more in a few weeks than it had in the previous
20 years.
   The Soviets insist that their credit problem is simply
caused by too many Soviet enterprises and banks having been
turned loose to borrow in the West. Many did so without
adequate means to service their debts. The cure, according to
this argument, is a recentralization of Soviet borrowing. But
that doesn't sound much like economic reform. Central
management is the primary source of Soviet problems.
   Mr. Mulford obviously has a good point. If the EBRD is to
be set up primarily to finance redevelopment of the newly
liberated countries of Eastern Europe, why on earth should it
finance Soviet consumption? Development financing presumes
that there will be a return on the investment. But the
connection between putting goods on Soviet shelves and
achieving economic reform in that country is a tenuous one at
best.
   Some use humanitarian arguments for feeding the Soviets.
Undernourishment clearly has become serious at the lowest
income levels of Soviet society. It worsens as shortages and
inflation grow. At the first meeting of his new cabinet,
President Gorbachev stressed that the food situation was the
biggest problem facing his government.
   But why should the West shed tears for a regime that still
is spending huge amounts of money to build weapons and to run
a world-wide empire? Merely cutting off Fidel Castro from the
Soviet dole or closing down the huge Soviet base at Cam Ranh
Bay, Vietnam, or scrapping one of the aircraft carriers under
construction, could feed a lot of Russians.
   Soviet militarism is part of the equation. If the Soviets
no longer have anything to lose in the way of Western
financing, will they become more aggressive toward the West?
That argument suggests, however, that the West should simply
bribe the Soviets to become good guys, a doubtful enterprise
even if it had a chance of succeeding. What in fact will
probably happen is that markets will make the decision. As
the Soviets begin to look more like bad risks, they will get
less financing. From that, maybe their badly underdeveloped
knowledge of how markets work will be improved.

   The Global View column on this page Monday, "Who Will Pay
the Bill for Russia's Decline?" used some inaccurately
transmitted statistics regarding man-days lost in the Soviet
Union. The correct numbers are 9.1 million man-days lost in
the first two months this year, compared with 7.3 million for
the full year 1989.
