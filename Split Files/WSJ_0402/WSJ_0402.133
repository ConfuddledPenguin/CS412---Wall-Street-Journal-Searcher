   BOSTON -- As a youngster in Brooklyn, Morris Smith would
study the stock tables in the newspaper -- just for the fun
of it.
   Not exactly everyone's idea of a good time. But, "I'm kind
of a numbers fiend, to a large degree," Mr. Smith explains.

   At age 32, the former public accountant suddenly finds
himself manager-in-waiting of Fidelity Investments' giant
Magellan Fund. And before taking over from the legendary
Peter Lynch, who retires May 31 at age 46 after running
Magellan for 13 years, Mr. Smith will have plenty of numbers
to ponder.
   Magellan, the nation's largest stock mutual fund, has $13
billion in assets, one million account holders and upwards of
1,400 stocks. From May 31, 1977, to Feb. 28, 1990, Mr. Lynch
guided the fund to a total return of 2,475%, compared with
508% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, according to
Fidelity. During the 1980s, the fund's average annual return,
including reinvested dividends, was 28% -- far outstripping
that of any other fund.
   So imposing is Mr. Lynch's record that it's been likened
to Babe Ruth's career home run total. And Mr. Smith, whose
passion for statistics has made him something of a sports
trivia buff, must recognize that Mr. Lynch is hanging up his
uniform at a time when the outfield fences are more distant
than ever: Magellan's phenomenal growth, since it was opened
to outside investors in 1981 with just $100 million in
assets, has made it much harder for the fund to beat the
market averages by any significant margin.
   "I've been in the spotlight before," Mr. Smith says
philosophically, recalling the brouhaha when a rising
Fidelity star named Paul Stuka left the Fidelity OTC fund in
1986 to start his own firm, and Mr. Smith took over the fund,
which now has $700 million in assets. Mr. Smith says he plans
to handle his new challenge the way he does his current job:
"I try the best I can every day."
   How good is Mr. Smith's best? At Fidelity OTC, Mr. Smith's
efforts have produced respectable results during a period
when small stocks generally languished. From June 30, 1986,
when he took over Fidelity OTC, through March 22 of this year
the fund ranks as the fifth best of 46 small-company funds,
beaten only by Hartwell Emerging Growth, Janus Venture, Acorn
and Kaufmann, according to New York's Lipper Analytical
Services. (Fidelity's advertisements tout Fidelity OTC as the
"No. 1 Small Company Growth Fund For 5-Year Performance," but
that includes the fund's big 1985 gain under Mr. Stuka.)
   Mr. Smith, whose fund must ordinarily keep at least 65% of
its assets in over-the-counter stocks, has tended to hold
relatively large-capitalization issues. A study done in
October 1989 by Chicago's Morningstar Inc. found that
Fidelity OTC's median stock holding was a company with a
market value of $878 million. Morningstar, which looked at 63
small-company funds, found only three funds with a higher
median market value.
   With larger-company stocks outperforming smaller companies
over the past few years, Mr. Smith's attraction to larger
companies -- something he describes as the result of
individual picks, not a broad strategy -- has clearly paid
off.
   Since taking over the fund in mid-1986, Mr. Smith has
managed a return of 36% through last Feb. 28, well ahead of
the 10% return for the Russell 2000, a small-company stock
index.
   But while Fidelity OTC has done well for a small-company
fund, the poor performance by smaller stocks means Mr.
Smith's record doesn't look so hot when stacked up against
the big-company stocks that comprise the S&amp;P 500, which
returned 50% during the same period. And with small-company
stocks out of fashion, continuous outflows since the 1987
stock market crash have reduced the fund to roughly half its
peak size.
   At Magellan, Mr. Smith will be competing against the S&amp;P
500 -- a benchmark Mr. Lynch managed to beat every year
except 1984 and 1987.
   Fidelity officials note similarities between Mr. Smith and
Mr. Lynch. Both rise early, work prodigious hours and seem
devoted to their families and religions. Both keep hundreds
of stocks in their portfolios -- Mr. Smith has 350 in the
Fidelity OTC fund -- and talk to dozens of companies in a
typical week. Mr. Smith is roughly the age Mr. Lynch was when
he took over Magellan.
   But there are also differences between the two. Mr. Lynch,
a master of the wry one-liner and quotable anecdote, plays
the media almost as deftly as the stock market. He
co-authored last year an investing book and closely monitored
its progress on the best-seller charts, according to
colleagues. Mr. Lynch's modest office in Fidelity's
Devonshire Street headquarters in downtown Boston is normally
a chaotic sea of documents and newspapers.
   On Friday afternoon, after two days of interviews, Mr.
Smith confesses to being weary of talking about himself. He
speaks in rapid-fire, run-together sentences and looks mainly
at his desktop when he's not checking his two computer
screens. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he busily
sorts through a stack of analyst reports that will provide
Saturday night and Sunday homework, leaving his desk as neat
as a pin.
   Mr. Smith describes his investment approach as similar to
Mr. Lynch's, and he says it's too early to tell what changes
he might make in the fund. He notes that Fidelity OTC's
portfolio contains several of Magellan's largest positions,
including Federal National Mortgage Association, General
Electric Co., Entergy Corp., Kemper Corp., Primerica Corp.
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That overlap will help
ease his transition, he says -- as will the availability, at
least initially, of two or three assistants. Like Mr. Lynch,
Mr. Smith says many of his investment ideas come from
Fidelity's 30 analysts and its other fund managers.
   Among the Fidelity OTC holdings that Mr. Smith believes
continue to present attractive buying opportunities are
Maxtor Corp., a disc-drive supplier whose technology is
"cutting edge" and whose "earnings could explode on the
upside"; Nike Inc., a company that "everyone is saying has
maxed out" but that Mr. Smith sees as having potential for
strong international growth; SNC Group Inc., a
Montreal-listed engineering and defense company that Mr.
Smith considers a "terrific turnaround"; and Prospect Group
Inc., a leveraged buyout firm. Mr. Smith says Prospect has
announced plans to liquidate, and he estimates the value of
its assets at the "low- to mid-$20s" a share, while the stock
trades at around $15.
   Mr. Smith, whose father was a fashion designer in New
York's garment district, earned an accounting degree at City
University of New York's Queens College and first dabbled in
stocks while working as a certified public accountant. His
master's degree in business administration from the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School landed him a job
as a securities analyst at Fidelity in 1982. Two years later,
he became manager of Fidelity Select Leisure Portfolio.
   As an analyst, "The first stock I recommended was Golden
Nugget," and though "not a difficult company" to analyze, "it
took me two weeks," Mr. Smith recalls. By contrast, Mr. Smith
says, he talked or met with precisely 40 companies in the
week before his Magellan appointment disrupted his routine.
"In effect, I analyzed 40 companies," he says, in what he
refers to as "one of those great, efficient weeks."
   Mr. Smith counts Rogers Communications Inc., a
Toronto-based cable television and broadcasting company,
among his best all-time picks. He says he recommended it to
other Fidelity managers after visiting the company in 1985,
at a time when many people thought it was headed for
bankruptcy. Instead, the stock went from around $7 a share to
$80 or $90 -- although Mr. Smith admits he bailed out after
he had tripled his money.
   Among his worst picks: convertible securities of Crazy
Eddie Inc., which he bought for more than $30 and sold at
around $13, as they headed to zero. "I used to shop at the
first Crazy Eddie" near his New York home, Mr. Smith says. "I
still believe in the concept. I just don't believe in the
company."
