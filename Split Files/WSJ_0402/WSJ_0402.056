   LOS ANGELES -- After toiling for decades in the shadow of
Coca-Cola Co.'s world-wide soft-drink dominance, PepsiCo Inc.
is planning its most concerted and aggressive catch-up
campaign ever.
   Gathering bottlers here from all parts of the globe for
its first ever international convention, Pepsi announced
plans to spend more than $1 billion over the next five years
to upgrade plants, improve distribution and bolster marketing
programs.

   The company also outlined a strategy to target certain
fast-growing market segments -- including diet soft drinks,
and fountain and vending machines -- that are still in such
an infant stage abroad that even Coke has no commanding
advantage yet.
   Pepsi estimated that such moves will more than double its
overseas soft-drink volume by 1995 to five billion cases from
about two billion currently.
   "Pepsi can close the gap against Coke internationally just
as we did here in the U.S.," Christopher A. Sinclair, the
newly appointed president of Pepsi's international business,
said.
   Pepsi's optimism, however, was met with some skepticism by
industry observers. With Coke's more than 2-to-1 market-share
lead in the international arena, analysts said it's unlikely
that Pepsi can significantly close the gap abroad overnight.
   Moreover, although Pepsi said its $1 billion budget is
"substantially" more than it has invested in the past,
industry observers said Pepsi will probably have to spend
substantially more if it ever hopes to catch Coke.
   In 1989, Coke had about $4.8 billion in revenue from
overseas, while Pepsi had $1 billion. Coke estimates its
international market share is 47% while Pepsi's is less than
half that.
   "I think they're going to have a tough time catching Coke
really soon," said Gary Hemphill, editor of Beverage Industry
magazine. "At the same time, there's so much growth
internationally that there's room for both of them out
there."
   While U.S. soft-drink volume has slowed to about a 3%
annual growth rate recently from 4% to 5% in the 1980s, the
international market is expected to grow in 8% to 10% leaps
annually for years to come.
   "This meeting acknowledges where the soft-drink industry
is really headed: offshore," said Jesse Meyers, publisher of
Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. "While Coke has a
substantial lead, there are still unplayed cards in Southeast
Asia, Russia, and now Eastern Europe."
   A Coca-Cola spokesman dismissed Pepsi's plans to match
Coke overseas as "dreaming."
   The Pepsi convention seemed like an orchestrated attempt
to rally overseas bottlers and to convince them once and for
all that Pepsi is committed to the soda business abroad.
Under the crush of Coke's global strength, some Pepsi
international bottlers have felt neglected, particularly as
PepsiCo has plunged hundreds of millions of dollars into
building its snack and restaurant businesses abroad.
   The company even flew out D. Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo's
chairman and chief executive officer, to address the troops.
Saying the bottlers' efforts were critical to PepsiCo's
success, Mr. Calloway promised to send each a share of the
company's stock to mark their relationship.
   Pepsi also gave its international partners some new signs
of hope. In May, Pepsi expects to open its first plants in
India, a giant market of 800 million consumers where Coke was
recently denied approval to sell soft drinks. And in the
Soviet Union, where Pepsi currently outsells Coke, Mr.
Sinclair said he expects to soon announce "an agreement that
will be the largest consumer products venture ever" in that
country.
   Mr. Sinclair conceded that Pepsi still needs to clean its
international house. Taste quality of its soft drinks varies
from country to country, packaging graphics are inconsistent
world-wide, and production inefficiencies have resulted in
partially filled bottles ending up on store shelves abroad.
   To help put an end to such basic problems, Pepsi will be
issuing a "Look Book," a manual on how to acquire and use the
best graphics available. The company plans to centralize
advertising-copy approval under its top creative executive in
the U.S., and it is launching the Pepsi Cola International
Management Institute to teach overseas managers the best
techniques in sales, finance and plant operations, among
other things.
   All of this comes on the heels of a corporate
reorganization late last year in which Pepsi reversed its
centralized approach, creating six geographic operations
world-wide with broad local autonomy.
