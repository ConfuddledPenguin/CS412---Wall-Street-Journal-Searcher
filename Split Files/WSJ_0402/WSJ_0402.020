   From remarks by Felix Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal
Assistance Corp. for the city of New York to the Woman's
National Democratic Club, March. 15:

   The Republican Party is internationalist and expansionary
militarily and economically; it is rigorously conservative,
if not to say reactionary, on social issues such as abortion,
school prayer, gun control, etc.; it is dedicated to the
pursuit of wealth through lower taxes and the absence of
regulation without any seeming concern for the appropriate
role of government. What does the Democratic Party stand for,
as an alternative to this program? It is exceedingly hard to
tell because the Democrats are not an opposition party. The
Democrats share power, they do not seek it. Seeking power
requires submitting alternatives to the voters and competing
for their allegiance; sharing power is an entirely different
role. The Democratic leaders in the Congress are men of
intellect and character, of decency and strength. But, they
are part of an existing power structure, almost a coalition
government with a Republican administration.
