   TOKYO -- Japan posted a $4.91 billion current account
surplus in February, narrowing 32% from a $7.26 billion
surplus a year earlier,the Finance Ministry said.
   But the results also marked a return to overall surplus in
the current account, after a $636 million deficit in January,
Japan's first such gap in six years.

   Japan's trade surplus in February was $5.49 billion, a 36%
shrinkage from the $8.52 billion surplus posted a year
earlier, but up strongly from January's $1.08 billion
surplus, which shrank because of seasonal and special
factors.
   Exports declined 2.2% to $21.5 billion from $22 billion a
year earlier. Imports climbed 19% to $16.1 billion from $13.5
billion.
