   Pernod-Ricard S.A. said its consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests rose to 1.45 billion francs
($254 million) in 1989, up 95% from the year-earlier total of
745 million francs ($130 million).
   The French beverage concern told a news conference that
the jump includes a nonrecurring gain of one billion francs
from the sale of its soft-drink unit, Societe Parisienne de
Boissons Gazeuses, to Coca-Cola Co. after a legal dispute
over French distribution rights for the U.S. company's
products.
