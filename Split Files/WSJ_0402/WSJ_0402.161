   MILAN -- Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, who has
launched a $1.26 billion bid to buy MGM/UA Communications Co,
received a prison sentence for fraudulent bankruptcy from a
Naples court in connection with the 1981 collapse of a
newspaper in which he was a part owner.
   The sentence relates to the failure of Il Diario, a daily
newspaper published in the Naples region between 1979 and
1981 and of which Mr. Parretti was briefly a director. Mr.
Parretti was sentenced to three years and 10 months in jail
and banned him from holding public office for five years.

   Mr. Parretti said he had already lodged an appeal and that
the court's decision would have no effect on his bid for
MGM/UA, a film and television studio. "Why should it have any
effect?" he said. "Everyone knew about this case. We made
full disclosure in the documents."
   In Los Angeles, officials at MGM/UA couldn't be reached
for comment.
   There is no prospect of Mr. Parretti being jailed in the
near future. Manlio Pennino, a lawyer representing the Diario
journalists who brought the suit against Mr. Parretti, said
an appeal hearing in Naples would be unlikely to start until
at least next year. Even if Mr. Parretti lost that case, he
would be able to request a further hearing before the Supreme
Court of Appeal in Rome.
   The court judgment said Italafin S.p.A., the company
founded by Mr. Parretti that controlled Il Diario, defaulted
on capital payments and that accounts were falsified. Six
other people have been under investigation in relation to the
newspaper's collapse; four of them have since died.
   The court decision comes at a critical time in Mr.
Parretti's bid for MGM/UA. Mr. Parretti's company, Pathe
Communications, has pledged to pay a $200 million security
deposit on the transaction in installments by June, and is
negotiating with Time Warner Inc. to sell it distribution
rights to the United Artists film library.
   Mr. Parretti declined to give details of the financing
package he is putting together for the $20-a-share MGM/UA
bid, except to confirm that banks he has contacted include
Italian ones.
   Pathe has extensive cinema and television interests in
Europe, including controlling Italian commercial television
station Odeon. Mr. Parretti also owns a Spanish real-estate
company, Renta Group.
