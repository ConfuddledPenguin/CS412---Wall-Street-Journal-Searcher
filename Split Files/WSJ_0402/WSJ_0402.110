   KIRKLAND, Wash. -- McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the
sale of 2.4 million Class A shares. The shares are held by a
trust controlled by William Taylor, chairman of Affiliated
Publications Inc., and two of Affiliated's directors.
   The proposed offering is contingent on an offering by the
trust of 2.8 million Affiliated Publications Class A common
shares. The trust owns 12.8% of McCaw's Cellular's Class A
common, or 7.8% of the company's total common stock
outstanding.

   In the filing, McCaw said investment in the shares
involves a high degree of risk because the company expects
its net losses to increase significantly for the foreseeable
future and "may exceed $1 billion in some years." However, a
spokesman said a substantial part of the loss would be in
non-cash categories related to depreciation and amortization.
   McCaw officials weren't available for comment. A spokesman
said he didn't know for many years the company expected to
post a loss.
   In 1989, McCaw had a net loss of $288.5 million on revenue
of $504 million. The company has never posted a profit, as
its heavy marketing costs, debt and other expenses have been
a drag on earnings.
   However, in the fledgling cellular industry, cash flow and
subscriber growth are closely watched as the best indicators
of a company's progress. McCaw showed rapid growth in number
of subscribers and its cash flow increased in its most recent
quarter.
   In the filing, McCaw also said it has a large amount of
debt related to its recent acquisition of a controlling
interest in LIN Broadcasting Corp. McCaw said it has
long-term debt of about $3.1 billion, including about $1.4
billion under a credit agreement with a group of banks.
   McCaw said it doesn't expect its operations to generate
sufficient cash flow to service all of its debt for the next
several years. However, the company said it believes it will
be able to make the required interest payment primarily from
cash generated by operations and borrowings from its bank
credit facility.
   McCaw said it believes it and LIN have sufficient
internally generated funds to repay its debt at maturity.
Alternatively, the company said it believes it will be able
to make necessary repayments and repurchases through the
refinancing of the debt obligations, sales of equity or sales
of assets.
