   ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- State legislators around the nation are
listening to 2 Live Crew, Guns N' Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.
   Committee chambers here and in Lincoln, Neb., Topeka,
Kan., Des Moines, Iowa, and Jefferson City, Mo., aren't
ordinarily regarded as arenas for the randiest strains of
rock 'n' roll, but the lyrics of contemporary music are
competing with the details of state budgets and the small
print of insurance regulation for the attention of lawmakers.

   An effort to require warning labels on recordings of rock
and rap music has moved to the statehouses, and a third of
the state legislatures are deliberating the question. Partly
because of this, the record companies have agreed to come up
with a new voluntary industrywide labeling standard.
   The debate over labeling raises serious questions about
the role of government and about artistic freedom.
   Michele Davis, director of the Republican Governors
Association, says, "For the decade of the 1990s, the most
bitter, emotional debates -- the screaming, the crying, the
real tough questions -- are going to be in the state
capitols."
   Tanya Blackwood, spokeswoman for the Recording Industry
Association of America, says, "All of this stuff going on in
the state legislatures is one of the most serious issues the
record industry has faced. It's harder to fight because we're
dealing with all of these legislatures instead of just going
up to Capitol Hill and conducting one fight."
   Many of the state bills were prompted by conservative
groups -- some of them part of the Christian Right -- that
sprang up to battle school curricula, sex education, abortion
rights and child care. The groups include the Rev. Donald
Wildmon's American Family Association.
   "This is a political force in its own right," says Michael
Geer, president of the Pennsylvania Family Institute. Thomas
Jipping, director of the Washington-based Free Congress
Center for Law and Democracy, says, "It's part of the same
pro-family movement that's trying to protect traditional
values."
   The issue cuts across political party lines. The major
sponsors of record-label legislation here in Maryland and in
Pennsylvania were Democrats.
   "I'm not Jerry Falwell," says state Rep. Ronald Gamble,
whose bill to require record labeling prevailed in the
Pennsylvania House 149-51. "We're regular guys who don't
think kids should be listening to this junk. We're spending
millions fighting teen violence and suicide and then across
the street there's the recording industry glorifying and
promoting the very things we're fighting."
   The labeling movement got its start when Tipper Gore, wife
of U.S. Sen. Albert Gore, and Susan Baker, wife of Secretary
of State James Baker, expressed alarm at songs dealing with
sex and violence.
   Four years ago, their group, Parents' Music Resource
Center, and the National PTA agreed with the Recording
Industry Association of America on a voluntary labeling
system. It included a warning label ("Explicit lyrics,
parental advisory") or the printing of the lyrics on the
record jacket.
   Today, Parents' Music Resource Center opposes the bills in
state legislatures making record labeling a legal
requirement.
   "The record producers can show responsibility themselves
by creating a useful consumer tool," says Mrs. Gore. But she
also thinks the record companies haven't lived up to the
spirit of their agreement.
   The major opposition to laws on labeling comes from groups
that agree with People for the American Way that record
labeling is "the music censorship movement of the 1990s."
   "This is just another one of these attempts to legislate
morality," says Stuart Comstock-Gay, director of the Maryland
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. "People don't
want to hear what they don't like -- messages about Satanism
or drugs or sex. But one of the bedrock ideas of our society
is that we allow all kinds of ideas, even offensive ones."
   When Maryland's House Judiciary Committee recently
considered labeling legislation, the hearing attracted Jim
Rogers, director of Mission America who says "we have to have
mainstream ideas controlling the country," and Kenneth
Stevens, a retired federal employee who says "the prudish
super-moralists persist in trying to use government to tell
the rest of us what we can read or view." The bill died in
committee.
   In some states, music industry officials worry that
legislative moves could disrupt the music distribution
system. In Arizona, for example, record-store operators say
the legislation before the state senate -- on hold while
lawmakers review the new voluntary measures -- would require
stores to invest millions to monitor and label recordings.
   "That burden would be ridiculous, so the practical effect
is that everything would get a label on it," says Michael
Braun, a Phoenix, Ariz., attorney for the Recording Industry
Association of America. "That's the only way the record
stores can protect themselves -- and it would defeat the
purpose of the legislation."
