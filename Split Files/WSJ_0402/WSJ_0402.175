   Leaders of the drive to curb abortion are searching for
new opportunities to press their efforts after suffering a
substantial setback in Idaho.
   Meanwhile, abortion-rights activists are warning that
Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus's veto of a restrictive abortion
bill in Idaho Friday night only highlights the fragility of
the right to abortion.

   Mr. Andrus, long considered an opponent of abortion,
startled many of his allies when he vetoed the Idaho bill,
which would have prevented about 95% of the state's
abortions. The governor, who in the past week had become the
focus of intense national lobbying, said the legislation was
"drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and without
compassion further harm an Idaho woman who may find herself
in the horrible, unthinkable position of confronting a
pregnancy that resulted from rape or incest."
   Mr. Andrus's veto of the legislation ends the issue in
Idaho this year. The state legislature adjourned for the year
Friday and, in any case, proponents of the bill lacked the
votes to override the veto.
   The legislation was drafted to prompt a U.S. Supreme Court
decision and was crafted with an eye toward appealing to
Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, considered the high
court's swing vote on abortion issues.
   Abortion opponents, who had hoped that the Idaho bill
would spur the court to override the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that established abortion rights, targeted Mr.
Andrus, who seeks re-election in November, for defeat.
   "This will go down as one of the greatest acts of
political treachery in American history," said Burke Balch,
state legislative director of the National Right to Life
Committee.
   Mr. Andrus's decision was made amid rallies and
counter-rallies at the state capitol in Boise and amid
threats, from the National Organization for Women and others,
that abortion-rights activists would boycott Idaho potatoes,
the state's largest commodity.
   The Idaho Republican Party already has signaled that it
will make abortion a major issue in the November election.
Democrats, meanwhile, indicated that they will resist efforts
from national organizations such as the National Right to
Life Committee to use what state Sen. Marti Calabretta, a
Democrat from northern Idaho, called "control and coercion."
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, said Mr. Andrus had "refused
to rob women of their rights," but added, "We face the
reality that for every Cecil Andrus there's someone who
stands ready to limit our right to choose. It is in jeopardy
at every turn of the road."
   The anti-abortion movement still hopes to prevail in state
legislatures in Florida and Louisiana. "Idaho galvanizes the
pro-life movement," said Mr. Balch. "This isn't just a
defeat. It's a political betrayal that angers people around
the nation."
