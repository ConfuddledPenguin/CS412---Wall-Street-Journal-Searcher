   NEW YORK -- Japanese dominance of the Euromarket, the hub
of international capital raising, is showing signs of
weakening.
   In the 1960s and 1970s, British and European banks
dominated the Euromarket -- the offshore market where
corporations and governments borrow outside their home
countries. U.S. concerns led the pack during the first half
of the 1980s. Then came the Japanese.

   Now, the stranglehold of Japan's so-called Big Four --
Nomura Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co., Daiwa
Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. -- is loosening. The
Europeans are making a comeback.
   But the volume of new issues of Eurobonds and
international equities slumped 28% in the first quarter to
$46 billion.
   Nomura -- while still ranked No. 1 with a 13.1% market
share -- had a 45% drop in its volume of Euromarket
underwritings to $6 billion for the first quarter, according
to Securities Data Co. Nikko saw its market share erode by
75%; Daiwa's share fell 55%. Yamaichi, ranked fourth a year
ago, didn't even crack the top 10.
   A major reason: The plunging yen and Tokyo stock market
have dried up demand for once-hot Euromarket warrant
securities issued by Japanese corporations. During the
quarter, Euromarket underwriting deals by the Japanese with
equity kickers have plummeted 72% to $5.5 billion amid a
recent moratorium declared by Japanese securities firms on
warrant deals.
   "The yen has had an uncertain patch, which in turn has
caused a blip in the warrant market," says a spokesman for
Nomura in London. "It's not surprising to see a slight
loosening of the grip of Japanese {investment} banks."
   West Germany's Deutsche Bank was in second place, raising
$4.1 billion, for a first-quarter market share of 9%. Union
Bank of Switzerland jumped to $3.3 billion, or a 7.1% share.
CS First Boston had a 5.7% share. Depending on the progress
of German reunification in the coming months, specialists say
it is conceivable that Deutsche Bank could eclipse Nomura
this year, particularly if the Japanese market continues to
stumble. "This might be the end of the Japanese dominance,"
says a U.S. securities executive.
   Most U.S. investment banks haven't yet been able to take
much advantage of the Japanese slip. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. is
ranked seventh among all Euromarket underwriters, arranging
for $1.7 billion in securities for a 3.8% market share.
Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. unit's share of the
Euromarket jumped to 5% from 1.2% a year ago; Salomon ranked
sixth, arranging for $2.3 billion in securities.
