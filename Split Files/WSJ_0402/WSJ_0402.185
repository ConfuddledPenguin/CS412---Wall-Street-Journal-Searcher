   In his Feb. 28 Rule of Law column "Lawsuits Against
Celebrity Ads: Where's the Beef?" L. Gordon Crovitz examines
a suit filed by our law firm on behalf of eight elderly
Chicago-area investors against endorsers Lloyd Bridges and
George Hamilton and an advertising agency. Messrs. Bridges
and Hamilton appeared in TV commercials endorsing securities
sold to our clients by A.J. Obie &amp; Associates, a defunct
securities firm that conducted a Ponzi scheme. The suit was
recently settled after a bankruptcy judge denied a motion for
summary judgment with a ruling that "endorsers for Obie had a
duty to make an independent inquiry of Obie to determine the
truthfulness of the message (they) delivered."
   Mr. Crovitz criticizes the opinions of the judge, stating,
"This ratchets liability well beyond earlier advertising
cases." We have a "beef" with this comment. On the other
hand, we have no beef with a law that requires endorsers who
ask consumers to trust them when they state facts about
products or services to inquire about the truthfulness of
such statements.

   This duty was imposed on endorsers because of the trust
relationship they share with consumers. When Mr. Bridges told
our clients that "A.J. Obie &amp; Associates offers secured
investments that return the same high yield year after year
after year," they believed him. They trusted him. When he
said the investment was safe and secure, they believed what
he said was true because he had checked it out.
   We also have a "beef" with Mr. Crovitz when he says the
law has been extended to the point where endorsers are now at
great risk. If an endorser makes no affirmative factual
claims about the product, which Johnny Unitas did not do in
the case cited by Mr. Crovitz, but merely introduces other
people who make the claims, then the endorser is not at risk.
Michael Jordan would not be liable for endorsing Air Jordan
sneakers, assuming he has examined the product, if he
expresses his opinion that Air Jordans are great athletic
shoes. But if endorsers state facts about products to support
their opinions, they are liable if the supporting facts are
not true.
   Bankruptcy Judge Robert Ginsberg's opinion clearly defined
the endorsers' duty when he said, "Lloyd Bridges has a duty
of an endorser of Obie not to make any representations that
would be deceptive. . . . Bridges was an endorser for Obie
and therefore, had a duty to make an independent inquiry of
Obie to determine the truthfulness of the message he
delivered on its behalf."

   Mr. Crovitz's column illustrates the danger of writing an
article without getting all the facts:
   The case of Luella Wilson, the old lady victimized by "the
lawyer who dreamed up a new doctrine called `negligent
entrustment,'" Mr. Crovitz wrote. Actually, this
well-established doctrine has been around a long time. It
holds you responsible, for example, if you give money to a
mass murderer so he can buy a machine gun. In the Wilson
case, here's what Mr. Crovitz left out: The old lady funded
her relative's purchase of a car, knowing he had flunked a
driver's test, had no driver's license, had no insurance and
had an alcohol and drug problem. He paralyzed his passenger
when he drove the car off a bridge.
   The "railroad worker" awarded nearly $500,000 because she
was asked to take a drug test. Mr. Crovitz left out that she
was a lowly computer operator who had nothing to do with the
operation of trains. She was a six-year employee in good
standing, with no history of drug or alcohol abuse. For
refusing to take the urine test, she was fired. The company
promised her a hearing, but reneged. Though she was pregnant,
the company summarily canceled her health insurance.
   The case of Unocal paying $5.5 million in a "citizens'
suit" over pollution in San Francisco Bay. Mr. Crovitz left
out that Unocal was sued over 2,300 incidents where its Rodeo
refinery illegally discharged millions of gallons of oil,
grease and phenols into the water routinely for eight years.

   I greatly appreciated your article and I agree with
everything you're saying. However, I want to set the record
straight in one particular, since you mentioned me and my
horrendous battle with the FTC in the 1970s. You mentioned
that my "Cooga Mooga family business" had something to do
with an acne product, and I certainly understand why you
would have that impression, thanks to the many
misrepresentations by the press and the FTC itself. But for
future reference, the fact is my four daughters had used a
very good skin-care product called Acne Statin, produced by a
doctor here in Beverly Hills, who asked me to do a commercial
for her product.
   Since I knew it was a good product, based on the
experience of my own teenage girls, and since the woman had
no money to pay me for my commercials, we agreed to a
25-cent-per-bottle compensation. That seemed fair, because if
the commercial worked, we'd all benefit -- and if people
weren't interested, we would all have to forget about it. As
it turned out, the commercial (made with my then-unfamous
teen-age daughter Debby) was extremely successful, and the
product took off like wildfire.
   Enter the FTC, egged on by a competitor, a doctor and
others interested in the now famous Retin A. Knowing the Acne
Statin doctor had not done the required double-blind clinical
studies on her product (as a naturalized citizen she was
afraid someone would steal her unpatentable formula), the
competitors made charges to the FTC and offered to do their
own clinicals -- roughly like having Chevrolet assess the new
Ford.
   An ambitious young lawyer went for it, seeing the chance
to clamp down on celebrity endorsements and make a name for
himself. He convinced my attorney that I should sign a
consent decree, not admitting to anything (because I wasn't
really charged with anything) but not doing any further ads
for the product until the doctor's clinical studies had been
done. The lawyer guaranteed my name would be kept out of the
papers if I would cooperate. But as soon as I signed the
decree, he called a news conference and trumpeted his
accomplishment. It hit papers and wire services all over the
world and sent tremors through Madison Avenue. And though the
Acne Statin doctor did clinical studies that substantiated
every claim that had been made -- she and her product were
ruined, and I have rarely been asked to do a commercial
since.
   Though the opposing doctor and the Retin A people had some
initial success, recently a lot of questions were raised
about the efficacy of their products, and the Acne Statin
doctor has for years been trying to alert the medical
community and the public to possible cancer connections with
continued use of Retin A.
