   NEW YORK -- The outlook for small stocks is brightening as
a lot of the giants get clobbered by weak corporate earnings.
   That's the opinion of a number of Wall Street analysts who
expect over-the-counter stocks to shrug off last year's sorry
performance and finally start pulling ahead of larger stocks
in the second quarter. The OTC market, they say, will benefit
from its concentration of "growth companies," those with
profits expanding faster than corporations generally.

   "I'm fairly positive on small stocks for the entire year,"
says Claudia Mott, who follows smaller stocks for
Prudential-Bache Securities. "They're going to have another
quarter of relatively better earnings" than large companies.
Prudential-Bache expects continued stock market turbulence
and another crop of weakening profit reports in the next few
months, with OTC stocks doing better than most.
   Not everyone is convinced of small stocks' allure. Some
analysts, exasperated by small stocks' failure to climb out
of their five-year slump, warn that the market could burn
believers in OTC shares.
   Through Friday, the Nasdaq Composite Index had recovered
6% from its January closing lows but still showed about a
4.2% drop for the first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, by contrast, has fallen only 1.7% so far this year.
   Mitch Meisler, Shearson Lehman Hutton's manager of OTC
trading, agrees that stronger earnings should help small
stocks outperform large ones. But he looks for corporate
profits to rebound in coming months, as inflation fears ebb
and interest rates become more stable.
   The battering that small stocks took in 1989 has left many
of them trading at depressed prices. While the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stocks are at around 13 times estimated 1990
earnings, Mr. Meisler says, the multiple for Shearson's
selected growth stock list is about 15 times, far below the
premium investors have paid for growth stocks in more bullish
times.
   But Scott Black, president of Delphi Management Inc. in
Boston, says the OTC market is riddled with statistically
cheap companies earning little or no profit. Many companies
with strong earnings, he says, are trading at high prices
compared with book value or at double-digit price/earnings
multiples.
   "You can't just make a case that small {capitalization
stocks} are better than large," he says. "When a company
trades at eight or nine times book {value} and something goes
wrong, the stock gets annihilated."
   Oracle Systems last week reinforced fears that unlisted
shares are more vulnerable to a downturn than their larger
cousins. The stock lost more than 30% of its value after the
company's spectacular earnings growth took an unexpected rest
in the fiscal third quarter ended in February. Nonetheless,
Oracle's profit is expected to rise more than 50% this fiscal
year.
   Other OTC technology stocks are sitting on recent hefty
gains and high P/E ratios. "Tech stocks are volatile and will
continue to be volatile," says Jack Laporte, president of T.
Rowe Price Associates' $1 billion New Horizons Fund. He says
Oracle's debacle is likely to cast a pall over the technology
group for a while, forcing the sector to retire from its
recent leadership position in the OTC market. But the
earnings momentum among technology shares is too compelling
to ignore, Mr. Laporte says. The New Horizons Fund has about
28% of its assets in technology shares, a level he expects to
maintain.
   Eugene E. Peroni Jr., chief technical analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, says stock prices in
general may be ready for at least a partial retracement of
their latest gains. But investors' move toward a more value
oriented, longer-term approach to stocks should protect the
many undervalued issues he sees in the OTC market, he says.
   "Just as we've begun to see a departure between Tokyo and
the New York {stock} market, I think we will begin to see
more of a departure between the secondary market" and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, Mr. Peroni says. "The OTC averages
will begin to keep pace and then to outpace the Dow
{industrials} over the next several quarters."
   Business services is one area of the OTC market where some
analysts see good buys. Prudential-Bache's Ms. Mott believes
the group's earnings rose 27% in the first quarter, with that
momentum continuing in the second quarter. Two bright spots
cited by T. Rowe Price's Mr. Laporte are Telecredit, which
provides check-guarantee services to retailers, and Paychex,
which processes small-business payrolls.
   The capital spending sector is another favorite among some
analysts, including pollution control, machinery and
electrical equipment companies.
   Delphi Management's Mr. Black finds value in only about 30
of the OTC market's roughly 5,000 issues. His picks include
Western Publishing Group, which publishes Golden Books for
kids; Plenum Publishing, which translates foreign scientific
journals into English; C.H. Heist Corp., an industrial
cleaning and temporary employment services company; and
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, of North Carolina.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.12 to 435.54, while
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 0.18%. OTC
advancing stocks edged out decliners by 940 to 921.
   American depositary receipts of Japanese companies traded
sharply lower in response to the 3.37% plunge in the Tokyo
market. Ito-Yokado's ADRs closed at 89 1/2, down 5 1/2; Tokio
Marine &amp; Fire's ADRs were off 2 7/8 to 43 5/8; NEC was down 2
to 65 3/4.
   Leading the most active list, Oracle Systems added 3/8 to
18 7/8. The stock plunged more than 30% earlier last week
because of disappointing earnings.
   Apple Computer fell 7/8 to 40 1/4. Traders say the stock
is reacting to news late Thursday of a federal court ruling
in a patent dispute between Motorola and Hitachi. Motorola
was ordered to stop shipping its 68030 chip, which is used in
many of Apple's computers.
   Intel eased 1/8 to 41 3/4. The semiconductor maker told
The Wall Street Journal that it expects to report that
earnings rose about 25% in the first quarter, fueled by
healthy sales of the company's latest microprocessor chips.
   American Travellers rose 1 1/4 to 20. Investor's Daily
dubbed it "Stock of the Week," saying that the company should
benefit from the nation's growing elderly population and the
rising cost of long-term nursing home care.
   Casual Male collapsed 1 1/4 to 3/4. The company said it is
considering seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection
after failing to sell itself or obtain additional capital.
   Gateway Financial lost 2 5/8 to 6. The Connecticut bank
holding company said it is taking an additional $8 million
provision for loan losses, and will report a loss for the
first quarter. The company also said it will suspend
quarterly dividend payments after the current dividend is
paid Friday.
