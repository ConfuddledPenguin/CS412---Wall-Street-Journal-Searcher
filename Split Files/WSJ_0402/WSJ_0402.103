   In the latest attempt by a U.S. commercial bank to invade
investment bankers' turf, Chase Manhattan Bank is hiring Mark
J. Lerner from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to lead a newly
established Japanese corporate finance group.
   The new Chase unit will specialize in advising U.S. and
Japanese companies on mergers and acquisitions, private
placements and joint ventures in each other's countries. It
will also put together financing packages for such
transactions.

   Until recently, Mr. Lerner headed the Japan group in
Merrill's investment banking division. There, he worked on
financings and acquisitions for Japanese blue-chip companies
such as Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., Mitsubishi Corp.
and Sony Corp.
   In September 1988, he helped structure a $200 million bond
issue by Toyota's American subsidiary in the U.S. market, the
first by a Japanese-controlled company. Early this year, he
was also involved in Kyocera Corp.'s more than $500 million
takeover of AVX Corp., the only time a Japanese company
acquired a U.S. corporation with stock rather than cash.
   At Chase, Mr. Lerner, 37 years old and a graduate of both
Vassar College and the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania, will be a managing director. His
appointment is effective today.
   Until now, advising Japanese and U.S. companies on
cross-border takeovers has pretty much been an investment
banking preserve. U.S. commercial banks were advisers on none
of the 10 largest Japanese acquisitions in the U.S. last
year, and a Japanese commercial bank advised on only one,
according to Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York merchant bank
specializing in Japanese-U.S. business.
   In 1989, Chase advised on 34 merger deals world-wide,
second among commercial banks after J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.,
according to Euromoney magazine, a trade publication. Still,
investment banks were way ahead, led by CS First Boston Inc.,
which advised on 172 transactions. Merrill advised on 118
deals, according to Euromoney.
   Investment bankers and takeover specialists contend that
big banks muscle their way into the merger business through
their power to finance deals, not through their ability to
assemble them.
   "Investment bankers understand pricing, structure and
valuation. The commercial banks, for all their prowess and
expertise still allocate credit; they don't make markets,"
says Daniel M. Schwartz, managing director at Ulmer Brothers.
"The Chases and J.P. Morgans and Bankers Trusts of the world
certainly have some talent and resources to bring to the
table, but ultimately they lack a market driven personality
to be successful in the merger business."
   Nonetheless, he adds: "I give Chase credit for hiring
someone with the right kind of experience."
   Mr. Lerner believes that U.S. banks can make more use of
their larger capital base and more extensive international
networks to capture additional merger business. And he adds:
"As commercial banks receive more and more powers to get into
the public securities business, they will be able to compete
more successfully for business with multinational clients."
   Until then, he plans to capitalize on Japanese companies'
penchant for private deals, ones that involve a minority
investment, the takeover of a private company or the
acquisition of the division of a public corporation.
   "Most Japanese business in the U.S. involves private debt
financings and private investments," says Mr. Lerner. "And
the overwhelming majority of merger and acquisition
transactions haven't been in the public market, except for a
few big, well publicized ones like Bridgestone {Corp.'s $2.6
billion purchase of Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in 1988}."
   Chase says that the new unit will open an office in Los
Angeles and probably in Europe as well. The bank will also
expand its merchant banking activities, investing in deals to
the extent that the law permits. "It should give Japanese
investors a good degree of comfort to have a major U.S. bank
put its own money on the line alongside them," says Mr.
Lerner.
   Chase has been active in Japan since 1945 and, along with
a handful of other major U.S. banks, played a big role in
financing the rebirth of Japanese industry after World War
II. Chase also handles a huge portion of the U.S. dollar
clearing for banks, institutional investors and corporations
in Japan, according to the bank.
