   LOS ANGELES -- McHaffie Inc., a Sylmar, Calif., defense
contractor, was charged by the U.S. Justice Department with
falsification of test data on bolts the company made for use
in various military jet aircraft engines.
   In a criminal information filed in federal court in Los
Angeles, the government alleged that McHaffie failed to test
the bolts and submitted fraudulent certifications to the
government over an eight-year period beginning in 1979. The
certifications indicated that the bolts had been tested and
met all manufacturing standards and other specifications, the
government charged.
