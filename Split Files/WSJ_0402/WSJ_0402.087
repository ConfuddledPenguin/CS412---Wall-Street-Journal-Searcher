   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. -- First World Cheese Inc. said it
completed a $12 million, two-year revolving credit agreement
with Bank of Tokyo Trust Co.
   The financing, which is secured by the company's available
assets, replaces the company's prior short-term credit
arrangements with another bank, National State Bank of
Elizabeth, N.J. As of last Thursday, First World's borrowings
under the prior arrangements were about $5.3 million.
