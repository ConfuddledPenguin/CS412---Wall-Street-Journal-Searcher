   William Farley's troubles with the acquisition of West
Point-Pepperell Inc. worsened when the unit he set up to buy
the company fell into default on about $733 million in bank
debt after negotiations to restructure the loan bogged down.
   According to a Wall Street person close to the
negotiations, Mr. Farley plans as soon as today to offer the
holders of roughly $905 million in West Point-Pepperell
subordinated debt a significant equity position in the
company in exchange for delaying interest payments for as
long as three years.

   If Mr. Farley is successful in the exchange offer to bond
holders, his bankers, led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers
Trust Co., are more likely to commit a restructuring of his
bank loan rather than forcing him into federal bankruptcy-law
proceedings.
   The bankers are known to be worried that the holders of
subordinated notes for which Mr. Farley might miss interest
payments in the next few months may force him into federal
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   The bankers, concerned about the possible costs of paying
bankruptcy-law attorneys to oversee lengthy legal
proceedings, would take it as a good sign to see approval of
the forthcoming exchange offer on the subordinated notes.
   Farley officials couldn't be reached for comment over the
weekend, but they are known to be continuing negotiations
with bankers.
   Last month Mr. Farley successfully negotiated a $1.2
billion bridge-loan extension through the end of 1994, easing
some of the pressure on the West Point acquisition. But the
bank loan that was due Saturday is an additional debt that
was used to help make the tender offer in the $1.56 billion
West Point acquisition in March 1989.
   Of the several entities under the umbrella of Mr. Farley's
investment and industrial empire, the bank-loan default
affects only West Point-Pepperell Acquisition, the holding
company that was set up last year to acquire the West Point,
Ga.-based textile concern.
   Mr. Farley has completed his tender offer on 95% of West
Point-Pepperell. But he is about $83 million short of the
cash needed to complete the transaction. Unless he completes
that deal, he can't use West Point's cash to pay interest on
the debt it produced. Thus Mr. Farley's only chance to finish
the transaction and keep control of the company is to
restructure certain of his bank and subordinated note debt.
   Mr. Farley, based in Chicago, built a collection of
manufacturing companies, largely on junk bond financing. But
his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., has
collapsed. Farley Inc., his closely held manufacturing
concern, had a pretax loss of about $40 million in 1989,
analysts estimated.
