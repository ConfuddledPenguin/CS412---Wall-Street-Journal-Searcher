   LONDON -- Sales of new cars in Europe rose 2.1% in
February from a year earlier, with most motor industry
experts now bullish about continued growth in West Germany
and France throughout 1990, which could lend balance to
downturns expected elsewhere in Europe.
   Despite a seasonal slackening in sales that pushed the
February totals 8.2% below January's, most analysts regarded
the performance as healthy.

   "I'm reasonably pleased with these figures," said Rob
Golding, motors analyst with Warburg Securities Ltd. in
London, echoing the sentiment of other sector watchers.
   Industry and government statistics from 12 countries that
normally account for 94% of non-Communist Europe's passenger
car sales showed new-car registrations totaled 1,040,000 in
February, falling from 1,130,000 in January and up from
1,020,000 a year earlier.
   In February, sales were off on the year in four of the
countries included in the survey: Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
the U.K. West Germany posted a modest 3.7% advance, while
France rose 10% and Italy climbed 11%.
   Britain and France contributed largely to the decline from
January, with interest rate-pressure on consumers trimming
sales in the U.K. by 19%. The residual effects of a civil
service strike in December obscured analysis of French sales
figures, which were down by 18% from January, experts said.
   Analysts' forecasts for sales in 1990 range between a 4%
decline and 4% growth. Most reckoned that a slowdown
threatening for the past several months would pull down sales
for the year and leave growth this year below the 3.4% seen
in 1989.
   However, "even two months (into 1990) is probably not
enough to give us a firm view about what is going on," said
Susanne Oliver of Britain's Hoare Govett Ltd.
