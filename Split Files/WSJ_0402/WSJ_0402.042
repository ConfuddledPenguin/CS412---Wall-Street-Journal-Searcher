   PARIS -- French auto parts maker Valeo S.A. is heading
into a period of consolidation after adding production
facilities and purchasing several companies in the U.S. and
Europe during 1989, Noel Goutard, chairman, said.
   "We invested the equivalent of 9.3% of revenue in 1989 --
about 1.8 billion francs ($315 million) -- on modernization,
new products and increasing capacity," he said, adding that
the company now has to work on improving productivity and
profitability of new operations.

   Mr. Goutard was presenting the company's full results for
1989 to French financial analysts, following the release of
revenue and profit figures to the press Tuesday.
   Valeo, the No. 2 auto parts manufacturer in Europe after
West Germany's Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., recorded a 15% net
earnings rise last year to 936 million francs on revenue of
19.5 billion francs, up about 18% from 1988.
   Analysts said they were disappointed with the results,
concluding that net profit below one billion francs during a
relatively good year for the auto industry portended hard
times for Valeo in 1990, during which the global car market
is expected to shrink.
   Mr. Goutard said acquisitions and inflationary pressures
weighed on the balance sheet in 1989. New purchases included
engine cooling systems maker Delanair Ltd. of the U.K. and
Blackstone Corp. of the U.S., as well as auto electronics
concern G. Cartier Systemes S.A. of France.
   Mr. Goutard said the companies acquired haven't yet
contributed positively to Valeo's balance sheet. The
companies generally had poor results on their own, and it's
Valeo's task this year, through rationalization, to turn
these new units into strong performers.
   Regarding the inflation effect, which cut into sales, the
Valeo executive said, "We weren't able to raise prices at the
same pace as inflation" in most markets, reflecting sharp
stiff competition from foreign auto parts makers.
   He added that as part of the company's rationalization
plan, 15 factories will be closed in 1990, leading to a
decline of about 10% in Valeo's work force. The number of
employees reached 34,200 last year, with 19,200 located in
France and 15,000 abroad.
   Mr. Goutard said the plant closings primarily will involve
factories that don't fit in with the company's product focus.
As an example, he cited a plastic injection plant run by
Cartier Systemes.
