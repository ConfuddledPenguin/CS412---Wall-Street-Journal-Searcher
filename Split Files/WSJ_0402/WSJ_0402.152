   NEW YORK -- Corporate treasurers' skittishness over
interest rates -- and fallout from the collapse of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the big junk-bond underwriter --
combined to batter the market for corporate debt offerings
during the first quarter.
   Corporations issued just $25.6 billion worth of new bonds
in the period. That's 33% less than a year ago and the lowest
level in more than four years, Securities Data Co. says.

   The bankruptcy-law filing by Drexel's parent company,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., dragged down an already
reeling junk-bond market. Just three new issues of these
high-risk, high-yield bonds were launched in the quarter,
raising $10.8 million. That was down sharply from 26 issues
totaling $151 million a year earlier. Junk-bond traders and
analysts don't expect a rebound any time soon.
   But the collapse of the $200 billion market for publicly
traded junk bonds bolstered issuers of mortgage and
asset-backed bonds. One reason: Investors nervous about
taking on risks amid the turbulence in the junk market felt
more comfortable turning to higher quality mortgage bonds
backed by the U.S. government, analysts say.
   The volume of mortgage and asset-backed bonds surged 46.6%
from a year earlier, raising $43.3 billion for the quarter --
the first time this debt tallied more than half of the total
new-issue volume. For Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co., mortgage and asset-backed securities accounted for
about 40% of their total underwriting volume.
   Issuers keen on getting assets such as credit-card loans
off their books found a ready market. The volume of
asset-backed bonds surged 77% to $9.4 billion, Securities
Data says. Merrill Lynch emerged as the leader in
asset-backed securities for the quarter, with a market share
of 24%, managing $2.3 billion. Merrill's strength stemmed
from its ability to underwrite securities using revolving
credit lines as collateral.
   Among mortgage-backed managers, Bear Stearns Cos. stood
out, raising $5.5 billion; Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
managed $3.9 billion.
   But here's the hitch: Much mortgage and asset-backed debt
typically doesn't generate fat fees. While the deals foster
relationships, securities firms "aren't making a penny on
it," says Securities Data's Francine Wissak.
   There, in a nutshell, is Wall Street's big problem: Few
tidal waves of cash these days. After the 1987 stock-market
crash, at least merger activity and junk bonds thrived,
picking up the slack from retreating individual investors.
But not much, it seems, is booming now.
   "The big-ticket items have slowed to a standstill," says
Perrin Long Jr., senior analyst at Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "The only thing putting any money into
(securities firms') pockets are the day-to-day commodity type
businesses," he says. And they don't make much cash.
   New-issue volume in the municipal, or tax-exempt, bond
market edged up 3% from the year-earlier quarter to $23.4
billion. Merrill Lynch, with a 12% market share, led Goldman
Sachs and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in the municipals
marathon. Securities Data's volume and firm rankings are
based on the principal amount of municipal securities with
final stated maturities of 13 months and longer; private
placements and remarketed issues are excluded.
   Here are how last year's new issues stacked up: Mortgage
debt accounted for 43.2%; investment-grade corporate debt,
32.4%; asset-backed debt, 12.5%; initial public offerings,
5.5%; secondary common stock, 3.6%; preferred stock, 1.5%;
junk bonds, 0.5%; taxable municipal bonds, 0.4%; and
convertible bonds, 0.3%.
