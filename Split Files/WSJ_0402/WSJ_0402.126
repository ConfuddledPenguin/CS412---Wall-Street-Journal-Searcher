   WASHINGTON -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee recommended that labels for the anti-AIDS drug AZT
carry information about proper dosage for children under 13.
   AZT has been approved for adults since 1987. Last October,
the FDA extended the drug's availability to children through
an experimental distribution program.

   Under the program, the drug is provided free of charge by
the manufacturer, Burroughs-Wellcome Co., the U.S. subsidiary
of Wellcome PLC of London. The company distributes a
strawberry-flavored syrup version of the drug, instead of the
capsule form it markets to adults.
   Dr. Ellen Cooper, director of the FDA's division of
anti-viral products, called the advisory committee's labeling
recommendation "an official statement from the government"
that AZT is "safe and effective" for children with AIDS. Some
insurance companies have been reluctant to reimburse
physicians who prescribe the drug to children because of
uncertainties about dosage.
