   WASHINGTON -- Damage from spinal-cord injuries, frequently
the cause of paralysis, can be significantly reduced by large
doses of a common generic drug administered shortly after an
accident, medical researchers reported.
   The finding represents a breakthrough in dealing with
injuries that afflict about 10,000 victims a year, mainly
young men hurt in auto accidents. Many end up spending their
lives in wheelchairs. Caring for victims of spinal-cord
injury costs the U.S. government about $4 billion a year.

   Until recently there was little doctors could do to lessen
the destruction of such injury, but researchers found that
large doses of methylprednisolone, a commonly used
anti-inflamatory drug, given within eight hours of a
spinal-cord injury, can limit damage.
   The study provides "significant evidence that neurological
deficits can be reduced if treated quickly," reported Michael
Bracken, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of
Medicine, one of the coordinators of the tests.
   He said the use of massive doses of methylprednisolone
shortly after the accident can, in some cases, mean the
difference between being able to use a walker and being
restricted to a wheelchair. In other cases, he said, patients
who might otherwise be paralyzed from the neck down might be
able to regain some use of their hands because of the new
therapy.
   The study, which featured clinical trials involving
treatment of 487 victims of spinal-cord injuries at 10
medical centers, was sponsored by the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National
Institutes of Health. Results will be published in the New
England Journal of Medicine next month.
   The tests compared 162 patients treated with
methylprednisolone; 154 who received naloxone, an
anti-narcotic addiction drug that tests had suggested might
hold promise for treating spinal-cord injuries; and 171
patients receiving a placebo. Six months after their
injuries, the patients treated with methylprednisolone showed
nearly 60% greater improvement in motor skills, and more than
twice the improvement in their ability to experience touch,
than patients on the placebo. Naloxone didn't turn out to be
an effective treatment.
   The key to success is applying massive doses of the drug
within eight hours of an accident, explained Phanor Perot,
chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the
Medical University of South Carolina, one of the centers
involved in the study. Doctors gave an initial dose of 30
milligrams of methylprednisolone for each kilogram (2.2
pounds) of body weight, followed by an infusion of 5.4
milligrams per kilogram per hour for 23 hours. The drugs were
administered intravenously.
   The drugs for this treatment cost about $300.
Methylprednisolone is made by a number of companies. Upjohn
Co. donated the amounts used in the institute's study, called
the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study.
   Spinal injuries rarely sever the spinal cord. Instead,
they trigger swelling and a series of chemical reactions that
over time damage nerve cells in the spinal cord.
Methylprednisolone arrests some of this disintegration.
Scientists don't know exactly how it works, but they believe
it improves the blood flow to the injured area and reduces
swelling. Scientists used methylprednisolone after animal
tests suggested that it might work on humans.
   The new therapy has been so successful that the
investigators recommended that doctors start using it to
treat spinal cord injuries. In addition, they suggested that
paramedics could be trained to administer the therapy.
   Dr. Perot said that the success of the methylprednisolone
therapy suggests that there may be other drugs that will
interrupt or slow the cell disintegration that damages spinal
cords in the hours following injuries. "We may need a whole
salad of drugs" to arrest the cell disintegration process, he
said.
   Another area of research is focusing on cell grafts and
regeneration to patch damaged nerve fibers. "Once you limit
the initial damage, the next phase is how to repair it,"
explained Barbara Bregman, a professor of anatomy at
Georgetown Univeristy Medical Center. However, she said that
progress in this area of research lags behind efforts to
limit spinal-cord damage.
