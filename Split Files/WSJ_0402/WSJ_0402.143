   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. now suspects that an apparent fire
March 14 at a Libyan plant allegedly used for making chemical
weapons may not have damaged the facility extensively and may
have been a hoax.
   Satellite photos taken in the days after the announcement
of a fire appeared to show the building at Rabta blackened,
though intact. Other information from unspecified sources led
the U.S. to conclude that the equipment in the building had
been badly damaged and the plant wasn't able to operate.

   The Libyan government blamed the West, especially West
Germany, for the blaze, and reported casualties and arrests
in the incident, while maintaining its posture that the Rabta
facility makes pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons.
   But as intelligence officials analyzed more evidence, the
circumstances of the incident have become vaguer instead of
clearer, Bush administration officials said, raising
suspicions that the plant may not have suffered much or any
damage.
   Asked whether the fire might have been a Libyan hoax to
trip up a U.S. campaign to get the plant dismantled, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said, "I can't rule that
out." One U.S. official said the administration was actively
considering the possibility that the whole event was staged.
He said intelligence analysts are studying a claim made by a
Libyan exile group that the fire was set using old tires and
other debris as fuel.
