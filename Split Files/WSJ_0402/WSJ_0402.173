   ITALY'S DRUNK DRIVERS

   Italian politicians, shocked by a rash of road deaths
involving people driving home after all-night revels, are
preparing a campaign to curb drunken driving and limit the
use of fast cars by young people.
   A decree expected to be approved by the cabinet this month
allows police to administer tests for drunken driving. Police
are now able to arrest only those who are clearly drunk
because the Public Works Ministry hasn't established the
maximum blood-alcohol level for drivers.
   Other measures include a limit on the time nightspots can
serve alcohol, a publicity campaign on the dangers of driving
after drinking and earlier closing times for discotheques.
   A commission will also study changing the highway code so
that young people would have to wait two years after getting
their license before driving cars capable of going faster
than 80 miles an hour.
                                                                                                       

   AIRBUS REBUTS INDIA
                                                                                                       

   Airbus Industrie derided as "fantasy-like" accusations by
India's top investigating agency that Airbus directors bribed
former Indian government officials to win a $1.47 billion
contract. The European aircraft-manufacturing consortium
threatened legal action against whoever originated the
accusations made last Thursday by the Central Bureau of
Investigation in New Delhi. Airbus deplored "the systematic
campaign of denigration against {Airbus} in India."
                                                                                                       

   WORLD CRIME
                                                                                                       

   Americans are more likely to fall victim to crime than the
citizens of 12 other nations, according to a survey published
by the Dutch Justice Ministry; Japanese are the least
crime-prone. The survey found the Netherlands the most
crime-prone nation in Western Europe but noted that the Dutch
figure was mainly caused by a relatively high number of
bicycle thefts. Of U.S. residents interviewed for the report,
28.8% said they had been victimized by at least one crime
against themselves or their property in 1988. In Japan, only
9.3% of those interviewed said they had fallen victim to a
crime.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN POSTPONES NTT BREAKUP
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government will wait five years before
deciding whether to break up Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone
Corp. A government advisory council suggested last month that
state-controlled NTT should be broken into three separate
companies offering local, long-distance and mobile-telephone
services. But the Finance Ministry, in charge of offering NTT
stock to the public, strongly opposed a breakup, claiming it
would hurt NTT shareholders.
                                                                                                       

   BURMESE HEROIN
                                                                                                       

   A U.S. narcotics official said there had been an explosion
of opium and heroin production in Burma. Melvyn Levitsky,
assistant secretary of state for narcotics issues, estimated
Burma's 1989 opium production at 2,625 tons against 1,280
tons in 1988. He said that there were no checks on poppy
production in Burma and that warlords were controlling
producing areas. He concluded: "Drug cartels in the last few
years have been winning."
                                                                                                       

   MONEY FOR ETHIOPIA
                                                                                                       

   The European Community is to grant and lend Ethiopia
$318.8 million to develop agriculture, industry, mining and
energy, the Ethiopian News Agency said. The agency said the
money would be handed out in the five years after 1991. It
said EC delegate Benno Haffner told President Mengistu Haile
Mariam at a meeting last week that 90% of the money would be
a grant. The agency said the EC had granted or loaned
Ethiopia $597.7 million between 1986 and 1990.
                                                                                                       

   FRANCE'S CHAMPAGNE CRISIS
                                                                                                       

   The French champagne industry is heading for a crisis
because vine growers aren't supplying enough grapes to
champagne producers.
   Despite negotiations for new contracts, 19,000 private
vineyard owners in eastern France haven't guaranteed to
supply major champagne houses with enough grapes for this
year's production, industry officials said. Philippe Le
Tixerant, spokesman for the association of growers and
producers, said the vineyard owners had pledged 43% of the
total champagne crop to producers, the lowest amount they
have ever contracted to sell.
   Private vine growers are seeking to cash in on the rapidly
expanding market by producing and marketing their own
champagne instead of selling their grapes to the major
houses.
   The Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne, the
producers' trade association, meets today to try to salvage
an agreement and prevent what major producers say could be
anarchy in the champagne market.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Addressing the opening session of the First International
Conference on Environmental Protection of the Himalayas, Sir
Edmund Hillary warned that the mountains were threatened by
deforestation and tourism. "The living standards {of the
Himalayan people} are increasing," he said, "but the
beautiful tracks and valleys have been littered and the
forests destroyed." . . . Britain's Prince Philip, head of
the World Wide Fund for Nature, said the consequences of
unimpeded population growth would be more devastating to the
world than a nuclear holocaust. He said political leaders
must "face the facts" and make serious efforts to solve the
population crisis.
