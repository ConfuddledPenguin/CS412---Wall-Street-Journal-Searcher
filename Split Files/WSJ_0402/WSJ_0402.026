   It's April again -- one of the two biggest months of the
year for maturing certificates of deposit.
   Over the next four weeks, according to some estimates,
investors will have to decide what to do with well over $100
billion of maturing CDs.

   Financial institutions around the country have been
gearing up for the occasion, readying a slew of special
promotions like "rising rate" certificates of deposit,
no-penalty CDs and even cash bonuses in an effort to capture
some of that treasure-trove.
   But unlike last April, when fierce competition among
banks, thrifts and brokerage firms helped drive some CD
yields into double digits, investors hoping for eye-popping
deals will be disappointed. The highest yield they can
expect: about 9% at some banks in a few especially
competitive markets, mostly in New England.
   "The bloom is off the rose," says Robert K. Heady,
publisher of Bank Rate Monitor newsletter.
   Interest rates in general are more than a percentage point
lower than they were a year ago. And with a softer economy in
some parts of the country tempering loan demand, many banks
have less need to go out of their way to attract deposits.
The government bailout of the troubled thrift industry has
also helped reduce aggressive competition, by eliminating a
number of institutions using extra-high yields to attract
desperately needed funds.
   All that might be considered good news for the stock
market. After all, yields on one-year CDs are generally
around 8%, two full percentage points below the historical
return on stocks, which has averaged 10% annually over the
past 63 years.
   Typically, however, investors are very conservative with
the money they put into CDs. Most of them simply roll over
maturing certificates into new ones of the same maturity.
This month will probably be no exception.
   "Customers are more wary of the stock market right now and
are looking for safety," says Anne Nelson, senior vice
president of CoreStates Financial Corp. in Philadelphia.
   Cautious CD investors do have some alternatives, however.
Treasury bills and money-market mutual funds both offer
yields higher than the average CD. Six-month T-bills were
yielding 8.22% last week, and the interest is exempt from
state and local income taxes. (T-bills, however, require a
minimum investment of $10,000.) The average seven-day
compound yield on money funds is 7.98%, and some funds are
yielding more than 8.5%.
   CD yields are actually up a bit from earlier this year. In
part, that reflects a slight rise in the general level of
interest rates. Some institutions have also increased rates
in recent weeks to beat the competition, says Norberto Mehl,
chairman of Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information
service. "It's a classic picture in March and April," he
says.
   April is a big CD month for several reasons, such as tax
deadlines and investments in individual retirement accounts.
Also, some of the cash that fled the stock market after the
October 1987 crash moved into six-month CDs, which, along
with one-year CDs, are the most popular maturities among
individual investors. That interest rates reached five-year
highs last April only added to the horde of cash becoming
available for reinvestment this month.
   Some banks and thrifts are trying to smooth out the
deposit inflows with odd-term CDs. New York's Bowery Savings
of America, for example, is offering four-month and
nine-month CDs with an 8.33% yield that could go up if
interest rates rise.
   Promotions on more popular maturities vary. In New York,
Bank of New York is advertising a six-month CD "that can only
go in one direction." Its yield, currently 7.78%, is
guaranteed to rise with any increase in the benchmark prime
lending rate. In the Washington, D.C., area, Perpetual
Savings Bank permits one withdrawal during the term of its
one-year CD without the usual penalty. Investors can also add
funds during the year.
   Provident Savings Bank in Cincinnati advertises "Cash
Bonus CDs" that "pay cash plus high yields." Bonuses range
from $50, for a $5,000 two-year deposit, to $2,500, for
$100,000 deposited for five years. The important thing for
investors is comparing yields. "The consumer-investor has to
look (at what the banks) offer . . . and see what he's really
getting," says Mr. Heady of Bank Rate Monitor.
   Bank of New York's six-month CD, for instance, is just a
tiny bit higher than the national average of 7.72% and
slightly below the New York average of 7.81%. Provident's
advertised yields include the cash bonuses.
   Long-term CD yields are relatively more attractive than
they've been in the recent past, which may encourage some
depositors to trade in their six-month and one-year CDs. In
San Francisco, for instance, both Wells Fargo Bank and Bank
of America are offering 8.44% on five-year CDs, compared with
7.90% for six months. A year ago, yields peaked at the
one-year or two-year maturities. Last October, another big CD
rollover month, yields were relatively flat across the board,
at around 8%.
   Investors looking for higher-than-average CD yields may
want to check with major brokerage firms, which negotiate
rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell. At
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for instance, an investor can get a
one-year CD yielding 8.25% or slightly more. The average
one-year broker-sold CD is currently yielding 8.14%. That
compares with an average of 7.91% at major banks surveyed by
Banxquote Money Markets.
   For the very highest yields, investors will have to seek
out individual banks offering special rates, because of local
factors. For instance, several banks in Boston, Providence,
R.I., and some other New England cities are offering one-year
CDs with 9% yields. "The whole outlook on banking is negative
in this area," says Edward D. McCarthy, a Providence
financial planner. "The negative psychology really works to
the saver's advantage."
