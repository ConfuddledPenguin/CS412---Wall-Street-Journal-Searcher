   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico reopened its debt-for-equity swap
program, which had been suspended since November 1987.
   Under the revamped program, $3.5 billion dollars in
Mexican foreign debt is to be swapped during the next 3 1/2
years for ownership interests in infrastructure projects and
state-owned companies undergoing public offerings. The
minimum discount the government said it would accept is 35
cents on the dollar of debt being swapped.

<TEXT>
   The new swap program is more limited in scope than the
original, in which banks traded debt outstanding for local
currency that was then used to buy into local companies. By
restricting the program to swaps of debt for infrastructure
or state-owned enterprises the government won't have to print
new money or issue more domestic debt.
