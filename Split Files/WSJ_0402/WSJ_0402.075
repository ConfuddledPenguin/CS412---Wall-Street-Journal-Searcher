   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said it no longer intends to
review exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe of
certain mainframe computers, telecommunications gear and
medical equipment.
   This latest effort to ease trade restrictions against the
changing Eastern bloc will give the Commerce Department sole
authority to license such exports. That is bound to make it
easier and faster for some U.S. companies to market
technology in those areas that is already available from
other sources. Pentagon officials said that the decision
won't affect shipments of more sophisticated, powerful or
high-tech equipment, which will continue to be reviewed by
both agencies.

   But the move highlights the erosion of Defense Department
involvement and influence in trade matters.
   Since last summer, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has
fought and lost a series of internal administration tussles
with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher over restricting
computer sales and other U.S. exports to the Soviets and East
bloc customers. The Commerce Department has prevailed in
advocating less stringent rules, and even top Pentagon
officials now concede that the Western alliance's
longstanding system of export controls is in danger of
collapsing under the weight of the rapid changes in East-West
relations.
   Regardless of what the U.S. does, Secretary Cheney has
told reporters, "the Soviets will find it easier over the
next few years to acquire Western technology." He and others
in the Pentagon have argued that export controls should be
relaxed on a country-by-country basis, as freely elected
Eastern European governments come into power and sever ties
to Soviet intelligence.
   But such a two-tier control system, Mr. Cheney has
acknowledged, is likely to be full of loopholes. The latest
announcement, for instance, didn't make any distinctions
between Soviet or Eastern European shipments.
   In the face of pressure from U.S. industry and European
allies, the Bush administration less than two months ago
agreed to work with 16 other industrialized nations to ease
controls covering shipments of a range of machine tools,
telecommunications equipment and smaller computers to the
East bloc. But after that meeting, Secretary Cheney continued
to advocate a go-slow approach. "I worry about the situation
in which 10 years from now the Soviet Union is governed by
someone" more belligerent toward the U.S., he told a business
group recently.
   Reducing Pentagon review of export licenses is expected to
provide a boost to companies eager to tap into the lucrative
market for certain widely used mainframes, desktop computers
and standard switching equipment for telephone systems. In
the past, Pentagon officials maintained that even certain
kinds of personal computers could provide the Soviet's
industry and military with powerful new tools.
   Industry and Commerce Department officials have argued
that lengthy U.S. reviews often caused American companies to
lose sales to Western European and Japanese competitors.
