   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Hallmark Cards Inc. sweetened its bid
to buy back at a discount $270 million of junk bonds issued
by its majority-owned Univision Holdings subsidiary.
   The closely held greeting-card concern also turned up the
heat on reluctant bondholders, who tendered only a small
fraction of the bonds under the earlier proposal despite
repeated extensions, by announcing that Univision will file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors if
the modified bid isn't accepted.

   Hallmark launched the tender offer in February, as part of
an attempt to rescue its investment in Univision. Hallmark
holds a 63.5% stake in the financially troubled operator of a
Spanish-language broadcast network.
   Hallmark's new bid calls for it to pay holders of
Univision's $165 million in senior subordinated discount
notes, due 1998, 55.3 cents on each dollar of face amount --
an increase from the earlier 45 cents. Holders of Univision's
$105 million in subordinated debentures, due 1999, are being
offered 31.5 cents on each dollar of face amount, up from the
previous 30 cents. The offers are scheduled to expire at
12:01 a.m. April 13; holders of the senior notes are being
offered accrued interest from Feb. 1, but the offer for the
subordinated notes doesn't include any such accrual.
   In New York, Wilbur Ross, senior managing director of
Rothschild Inc., who represents holders of a majority of
Univision's two debt issues, said the group views the latest
proposal "as a constructive change, made in good faith."
   He added, however, that the bondholders still have
questions about the allocation of the funds between the two
issues, and the total amount to be offered for the debt.
