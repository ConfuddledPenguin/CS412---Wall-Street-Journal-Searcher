   Japanese trade negotiators will unveil in Washington today
a package of proposed domestic economic reforms that took
extraordinary political wrangling to produce, but which will
likely disappoint their U.S. counterparts.
   Separately, the U.S. and Japan have agreed to steps to
further open the Japanese market to foreign
telecommunications goods and services, and are close to
another market-opening accord on trade in satellites, trade
officials said.

   One of Japan's most significant reform proposals, say
Japanese officials, will likely be an overhaul of the
large-scale retail-store law, which protects politically
influential mom-and-pop storeowners but blocks many big
stores from opening.
   Toshio Yamaguchi, the head of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party committee drafting Japan's strategy for the
bilateral structural talks, said in a Japanese television
interview Sunday that government leaders were considering
endorsing repeal of the law in large cities.
   The U.S. says the law is unfair because new Japanese
stores can open branches in America almost immediately, but
new stores in Japan can be forced to wait as long as 10
years. U.S. negotiators also say large stores, even
Japanese-owned, are more likely to carry imported goods.
   Mr. Yamaguchi also said Japan would probably respond to
U.S. demands for increased public spending by publicizing how
much it is planning to spend on various projects already
budgeted, such as sewerage systems and public parks. The U.S.
wants Japan to spend more, because macroeconomic theory
suggests Japan's unusually high savings rate contributes to
its huge trade surplus, and increased public spending would
reduce national savings.
   Other Japanese government officials said a third major
government proposal would be to revise the anti-monopoly law
by, among other things, increasing the monetary penalty for
violations. The U.S. has argued that lax antitrust
enforcement has damped foreign competition.
   U.S. and Japanese officials are expected to work out,
perhaps as soon as tomorrow, an interim report on the
year-long Structural Impediments Initiative discussions aimed
at clearing away some of the underlying causes of the $49
billion bilateral trade imbalance. A final report is
scheduled for completion by July.
   Although most of the attention has focused on Japan, the
U.S. is also supposed to propose changes in its economic
structure, including measures to encourage increased savings
and investment.
   Japan was the main subject of the National Trade Estimates
report released Friday by the White House trade
representative's office. The report will be the basis for the
Bush administration's decision -- expected at the end of
April -- on which countries to target under the tough Super
301 provision of its 1988 trade act. The Super 301 provision
requires the administration to identify and try to resolve
particularly egregious trade barriers, with the threat of
trade retaliation if those talks are unsuccessful.
   The U.S. is particularly anxious to ensure that its
hi-technology industries aren't hurt by foreign trade
practices. Thus, last year, Japan's satellite and
supercomputer trade practices were targeted under Super 301.
This year, the National Trade Estimates adds amorphous metals
to its list of complaints against Japan, alleging that the
U.S. patent holder, Allied-Signal Inc., has been unable to
license production in Japan "despite years of effort."
   Late Friday, the two countries agreed on a
telecommunications accord, just before a Saturday deadline
that could have been the signal for U.S. trade retaliation.
The accord involves network channel terminating equipment.
   Network channel terminating equipment are modem-like
devices used to connect computers to digital communications
networks. The Japanese market for these products is estimated
at $1 billion during the next five years, according to
industry estimates. Foreign companies have argued that
certification procedures are used to discriminate against
them in the Japanese telecommunications market.
   The Japanese also agreed to resolve the problems for
foreign companies that arise out of the distinction that
Japan makes in its telecommunications certification
procedures, a senior U.S. official said.
   The countries agreed to implement the liberalization
measures within the next 120 days. Continuing bilateral talks
on opening the Japanese satellite market have made "progress"
and are set to resume next week, a U.S. trade official said.
