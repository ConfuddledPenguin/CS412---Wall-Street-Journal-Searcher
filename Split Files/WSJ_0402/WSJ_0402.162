   A year ago, the Rochester, N.Y., company had net income of
$3.2 million, or 39 cents a share, on sales of $204.1
million. The per-share figure reflects a 3-for-2 stock split
paid in December.
   David J. McDonald, Curtice-Burns president and chief
executive officer, said the earnings decline reflects a poor
crop year in the Northeast and high ingredient costs in the
meat snack business. Sales of the company's oat bran products
have also declined and prices on certain canned and frozen
vegetables have dropped.
