   NEW YORK -- Bank of New York Co. purchased a 19.9%
interest in Inter-Maritime Bank Geneva for a sum believed to
be less than $15 million.
   Inter-Maritime's principal owner is Bruce Rappoport, a
Swiss financier who is also one of Bank of New York's largest
shareholders.

   A Bank of New York spokesman said the purchase reflects
the bank's interest in international trade finance.
   In 1988, Bank of New York reported that Mr. Rappoport held
about two million of the company's shares. The bank's latest
filings, which reflect the additional shares issued to
acquire Irving Bank Corp. at the end of 1988, don't mention
Mr. Rappoport's stake, suggesting that it has fallen below
5%.
