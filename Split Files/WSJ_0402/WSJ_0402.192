   The American Heart Association is about to close down its
controversial seal-of-approval program for low-fat foods,
just two months after the program was launched, marketing
executives say.
   The AHA is expected to announce today or tomorrow that it
is discontinuing the seal because of objections from the Food
and Drug Administration. AHA officials wouldn't confirm the
move, but Scott Ballin, vice president of public affairs,
conceded that "the FDA has problems with the seal, and with
third-party endorsements of food products by us or anyone.
The next question is, based on those facts, where do we go
from here?"

   AHA officials met throughout the weekend to discuss their
options. Industry executives believe the group, while doing
away with the seal itself, will refocus on other parts of the
seal program, known as HeartGuide. Among the alternatives
they are considering are education efforts and working with
the FDA either on a different labeling program or to refine
the regulatory agency's own proposed food labeling
regulations.
   The seal-of-approval concept has been troubled from the
start. The AHA developed the program to identify foods it
deemed low in cholesterol, sodium and fats. Brands that
passed muster -- and paid a fee -- could display the AHA
HeartGuide logo on their labels and in advertising. The AHA
had grand visions of making the seal the equivalent of the
Good Housekeeping seal, and encouraged products that bore it
to trumpet the fact in ads. When the seal was introduced in
early February, several brands, including Mazola and Promise
margarines and Pam non-stick spray, were planning major
marketing campaigns around it.
   But the program immediately raised the ire of the FDA,
which promptly threatened regulatory action. In a warning
letter sent in February, James S. Benson, acting commissioner
of the FDA, told the AHA that its program would "increase
consumer confusion and hamper any comprehensive solution to
the food-labeling problem." For example, the FDA was
concerned that the HeartGuide seal on margarine and oils
would lead consumers to believe that these were health foods.
Friday, the FDA repeated its objections to third-party
endorsements in another letter to the AHA.
   The FDA's complaints prompted most of the 103 brands in
the initial launch of HeartGuide to back out before the
program even started; among the defectors were Mazola, Pam,
Promise and C&amp;W Frozen Foods. But several dozen remained,
with some going through the expense of redesigning their
packaging to show off the seal. They will now have to remove
the seal, if they haven't already.
   The HeartGuide seal's demise comes as the FDA is
considering its own health-claim labeling regulations,
perhaps with input from the AHA. The FDA earlier this year
proposed tough new labeling restrictions that would crack
down on many claims, and probably would discourage many of
the labeling claims made today. But consumer activist groups
have criticized the FDA for dragging its feet on health
claims.
   "I'm concerned that the FDA won't go far enough or act
quickly enough," says Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition
for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer
activist group. "The demise of this program means we need to
put more pressure on the FDA. It provides one more reason to
push for legislation that would force the FDA to overhaul
food labels." Two bills pending on Capitol Hill would require
the FDA to define terms like "light" and "low fat."
   The FDA declined to comment. It may have been concerned
because other health groups were considering their own stamps
of approval for foods, which could have led to consumer
confusion.
   Still, says Ms. Liebman, the demise of the HeartGuide seal
"is a shame for consumers who want simple thumbs up or thumbs
down advice on whether a food is good for their heart. This
kind of labeling is something the FDA should have been doing
a long time ago."

   Campbell Soup Accounts
                                                                                                       

   Campbell Soup announced a long-expected consolidation of
its ad agency lineup, cutting out three agencies while
spreading the bulk of its $150 million account more equally
among four others.
   In the reorganization, Campbell cuts out DDB Needham, Hal
Riney &amp; Partners and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi/London, each of which
had relatively small pieces of Campbell business. BBDO and
FCB/Leber Katz Partners are the biggest beneficiaries of the
consolidation, picking up most of that business and putting
them closer in league to Backer Spielvogel Bates, which had
been Campbell's largest agency.
   Backer Spielvogel, which had an estimated $35 million in
Campbell business, wasn't affected by the agency shake-up,
but now faces formidable competition from its fellow Campbell
agencies. BBDO's billings now rival Backer Spielvogel's.
Industry executives say FCB/Leber Katz's billings are
slightly less than that, as are those of Ogilvy &amp; Mather,
another major shop that retained all of its business except
for a small Swanson account.
   Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., said it made the shifts
because of its planned agency incentive program, in which
compensation will be tied to sales performance. Campbell said
it plans to tell its agencies details of the plan "in a few
weeks." The program is to go into effect August 1.
   BBDO, like DDB Needham an Omnicom Group agency, picks up
Swanson frozen foods, which had been handled by both Riney
and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. BBDO also won Mrs. Paul's Kitchens
frozen food, an assignment previously handled at DDB Needham.
BBDO will continue to handle Campbell's Chunky soups and
Campbell's Home Cookin' soups.
   FCB/Leber Katz, a unit of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding that
currently handles the Prego spaghetti sauce account, picks up
the Souper Combo account, which had been handled at BBDO. The
agency was also named to handle the V8 juice business, which
had been at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, London.
   Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a unit of WPP Group, will continue to
handle a number of brands, including Le Menu dinners and
Pepperidge Farm products. Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi agency, will retain Campbell's condensed soups and
Campbell's Special Request line of soups.
