   EVANSTON, Ill. -- I'm whirling around an ice rink wearing
the protective padding of an armadillo.
   That's fortunate, because in the past half-hour, I've been
whacked with sticks, pummeled into the boards and conked on
the head. I have also blocked a slap shot with my rear end.

   For the evening, I'm playing left wing for the Lords, an
amateur ice-hockey team, not to be confused with the Chicago
street gang. The Lords compete in the advanced-intermediate
level of a nationwide league called Hockey North America.
Participants spend a day a week pretending they can skate and
shoot like Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.
   Since 1980, the HNA, based in Washington, D.C., has grown
from 100 players to more than 12,000, in 26 cities. The
league attributes its success in some measure to the
continuing national fitness craze. But hockey, with its
furious pace and bump-and-grind action, has a more basic
appeal: "This is not a yuppie sport," says Gary Poteshman,
who sells cutting tools and has played with the Lords for
five years. "When you put on all your equipment and go out on
the ice, you become a totally different person. You're a
warrior."
   Many players also are attracted to the HNA's brand of
play: no fighting or serious checking; that is, no slamming
opponents into the side of the rink. The league enforces the
rules: Each year, the HNA suspends (for from two years to
life) several dozen players because of excessive violence.
   That doesn't mean HNA games are as harmless as a
low-impact Jane Fonda workout. Even with the no-checking
rule, players collide in tussles for the puck. "It's very
physical," says Max Mintzer, a tax specialist for Northern
Trust Co. and HNA's Chicago-area coordinator. "People are
swatting at you. You get elbowed in the head. I've seen a
couple of guys break bones." Since its inception a decade
ago, the league has had two deaths, both from heart attacks.
   At the beginner level, HNA takes any man or woman brave
enough to apply. Some 10% of those who join have never
skated. When I phone the league to ask if I can play in a
game, I am grilled about my experience -- not to determine if
I can hack it, but to make sure I'm not too good. "We don't
want you to go out there and mess up a game by scoring five
goals," a league official tells me. I assure him that that
isn't likely: I'm a potato-shaped newsman who hasn't played
ice hockey since college 14 years ago. The only other thing
the league wants to know is more ominous: Do I have adequate
health- and life-insurance?
   The Lords' roster includes a supermarket manager, an IRS
attorney and a district manager for Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream
Co. The youngest player is 22; the oldest 39.
   Before playing in my first game, I attend two team
practices. During these sessions, our coach, Bill Christy,
puts us through a series of passing, skating and shooting
drills that last about an hour. At first, my biggest obstacle
is getting comfortable with the 25 pounds of hockey gear I
have to wear: elbow pads, shoulder pads, armored gloves, shin
protectors, padded pants and helmet. I figure if hockey
doesn't work out, I can always join the bomb squad. The only
parts of me that are unprotected are the backs of my legs, my
inner arms and my neck.
   I feel like the Michelin Man as I skate clumsily around
the rink. By the second session, a week later, my feet are
covered with Band-Aids, but I'm skating forward and backward
without feeling that I am about to capsize. The coach says
I'm ready for my first real game, which is to be against the
Bandits.
   Before the game -- played at 10:30 on a Tuesday night when
normal people are getting ready for bed -- I set what I think
are some reasonable goals for myself: Try not to fall down
and don't get sent to the penalty box. In general, I'll be
satisfied so long as I don't disgrace myself or get carried
off the ice on a stretcher.
   OK, I'll admit it, I also dream of skating up ice like a
National Hockey League star and blasting the puck past a
terrified goalie. I realize that is a vain hope.
   In a musty locker room before the game, Coach Christy
divides the team into offensive and defensive alignments.
Hockey -- even by HNA standards -- is so fast-paced that
players need to be rotated on and off the ice every 90
seconds or so to keep fresh legs in the game. The coach,
apparently doubting my potential, assigns me to the last of
three forward lines, each with three players. There also are
three pairs of defensemen.
   As I skate out onto the ice wearing a blue and orange
Lords jersey with a lucky 7 on the back, I see spectators
have begun assembling for the game. Only four spectators, but
in a moment of pre-game jitters, I trip and fall over my
stick.
   The action begins. Skate blades flash up and down ice,
bodies thump against the boards -- the fencing on the
perimeter of the playing area -- and sticks crackle on pads
and the darting puck. Some Lords are graceful. Then there is
Bill McDermott, a 34-year-old hospital manager playing
offense. He winds up for a big slap shot -- one of hockey's
most dramatic moments. On the downstroke, however, Bill's
stick misses the puck entirely, spinning him in a
half-circle. "Hey, Bill, I could feel the breeze," one of the
Lords, Max Mintzer, yells from the bench.
   The Lords first score comes when Aram Dakarian, who
manages a supermarket meat department, makes a nifty pass to
Gary Poteshman. This time, stick and puck connect. The black
disk floats into the net, and the Lords hoist their sticks to
celebrate the team's first goal. Players sitting on the bench
lean over the boards and bang them with their sticks.
   The goal ties the score 1-1, and it is now time for our
third line to make its first appearance. That's me.
   As I climb nervously onto the ice, the coach grabs my
jersey and tells me to "hang back and try to get a feel for
the flow of the game. See how fast you can skate. . . ." I
detect some concern in his voice.
   From the bench, an HNA game doesn't look particularly
frenetic. But on the ice, it takes all my energy to keep up.
I am soon out of breath, the puck seems always to be headed
the other way. Toward the end of my shift, I have a brief
chance to shoot. But just before I let go, two Bandits
converge and hack at me with their sticks. I feel as though I
am caught in a threshing machine. As I struggle to stay on my
feet, the puck vanishes.
   Returning to the bench, I notice steam escaping my jersey
and coming out of the holes in my socks.
   My second turn on the ice is more eventful. After a
teammate passes me the puck, I maneuver around a Bandit
defenseman, glide toward the net and shoot. For a moment it
looks like the puck might actually get through, but the
goalie blocks the shot with his glove. "I was robbed," I
mutter to my plastic face shield.
   In a flash, the Bandits are back on the attack in our
zone. I try to tie up one of them in front of our goal just
as another Bandit winds up for a slap shot. While my opponent
and I are whacking at each other, the hard rubber puck
ricochets off the seat of my pants.
   The bench explodes. "Hey, Wall Street Journal. Great
defense," someone shouts.
   Penalties become a big problem for the Lords as the game
progresses, as we are forced to play short one man for
extended periods. That inspires a lecture from our coach on
the fine points of fouling the other team without getting
caught.
   Throughout the game, both benches shout encouragement to
their fellows doing battle on the rink. During one of my
rushes, I hear the Lords loudly shouting my name. Touched, I
tip my helmet to them, only to discover that they are just
trying to get me off the ice. I have played a minute past my
line change, thus keeping one of our stars from his turn at
play.
   After several scoring opportunities go awry in the third
period, some Lords are feeling frustrated. "We can't buy a
goal," our captain yells in despair. But the 1-1 deadlock is
finally broken when Bill McDermott redeems himself for his
earlier whiff. Accepting a pass from Frank Winterer, a
banker, Bill moves in toward the net and scores. He's a hero.
   In the closing minutes, with the Lords still ahead by one
goal, Coach Christy gets excited: "Trip them, hold them, jump
on them. Just don't let them score]"
   As it happens, we actually score again ourselves, and I am
credited with an assist on the final goal in our 3-1 victory.
   After the game, Coach Christy has high praise for my
performance. "Well," he says, "you didn't embarrass yourself
too badly."
