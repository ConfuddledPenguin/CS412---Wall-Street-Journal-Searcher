   BOHEMIA, N.Y. -- American Therapeutics Inc. said it
pleaded guilty in connection with the delivery of a gratuity
to a Food and Drug Administration official.
   "We deeply regret any impropriety taken under American
Therapeutics' name," John D. Meloy, a company director, said
in a statement.

   Last month, American Therapeutics said it would plead
guilty to one count of use of interstate facilities in aid of
racketeering. It also pledged to cooperate in the continuing
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore.
   Sentencing is set for July 23. The company faces a maximum
fine of $500,000.
   Also last month, a former consultant to the generic drug
maker, Mohammed Azeem, pleaded guilty to two criminal counts
related to providing illegal gratuities to FDA employees.
