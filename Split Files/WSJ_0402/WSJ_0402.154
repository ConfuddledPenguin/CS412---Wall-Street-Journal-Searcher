   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court's announcement that it
will rule this spring on the new federal flag-burning law
followed some unusual legal and political maneuvering.
   The justices announced on Friday that they will hold a
special, hour-long argument on May 14, two weeks after the
scheduled end of oral arguments for the term, to consider the
constitutionality of the flag law passed last year by
Congress. A decision in the case is expected in late June or
early July.

   A recent vote in the House demonstrates the strong
passions the case has stirred. By a 309-101 vote, the House
withdrew a brief filed in the Supreme Court by House counsel
Steven Ross. The brief urged the court to hear the case and
uphold the law. But the hot point of contention was the
timing of Supreme Court review.
   When it passed the law, Congress included a provision
calling for expedited review by the high court. Based on that
provision, after federal judges in Seattle and the District
of Columbia declared the law unconstitutional, the Bush
administration on March 14 urged the high court to put the
appeal on a fast track for argument this month -- even though
the usual deadline for April hearings had passed.
   In contrast, the House brief had said Congress simply
meant that the court should "give the case priority when it
devises its argument calendar for October."
   House Republican leaders provoked the vote to withdraw the
brief, complaining that they weren't consulted on it, and
focusing on the brief's suggestion that there was no need for
the high court to rush to hear the case this spring.
   The vote came to be seen as an election-year test of
lawmakers' commitment to protecting the flag. The issue, said
Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), was whether the House
would "leave that flag unprotected for a longer period of
time, maybe all summer, maybe till after the election."
   After the House vote, Mr. Ross and Democratic leaders met
with the Republicans; the next day, the brief was refiled,
but the discussion of how quickly the case should be decided
was deleted.
   Democratic leaders insisted they hadn't been trying to
delay Supreme Court action until after the November election.
The suggestion in the brief for a routine schedule, rather
than a fast track, was to give the lawyers ample time to
research the case, they said.
   Rep. Craig Washington (D., Texas), said that the November
election had nothing to do with the issue, "except someone
wants to use it for political purposes."
   Ever since the high court struck down a Texas
flag-desecration law last June, the question of how to
protect the flag has been a tough one for Democrats. Most
Democratic lawmakers pushed for the new federal law in the
hope that it would be upheld by the Supreme Court and there
would be no need for a constitutional amendment favored by
many Republicans.
   If the Supreme Court now strikes down the federal law,
Democrats will find it difficult to oppose a constitutional
amendment, especially a few months before the November
congressional elections.
