   BOEING Co. (Seattle) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
raised its rating on this aerospace concern's senior debt to
double-A from double-A-minus. The rating concern said about
$500 million in long-term debt is affected. S&amp;P cited
favorable prospects for commercial aircraft sales that
outweigh weak performance in Boeing's defense business.
