   A patented calcium supplement found in some Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. juices builds bone density in children, according
to a study funded by P&amp;G and the National Institutes of
Health.
   Researchers at Indiana University's School of Medicine
said the first two years of a three-year study on the calcium
supplement show that adding it to children's diets could help
them avoid bone fractures and diseases later in life.

   The results, to be released today, confirm what many
scientists and consumers already knew: calcium builds bones.
But this research shows a link between childhood diets and
bone mass.
   Marketers are skeptical, however, that the results will
help the consumer products giant's Citrus Hill brand juices,
which trail in third place in market share behind Minute Maid
and Tropicana.
   "This won't set the world on fire," said Michael Bellas,
president of Beverage Marketing Corp. Added Tom Pirko,
president of Bevmark Inc., a management consulting firm:
"They may be able to make more claims about their juice, but
it's not like they're rediscovering oat bran."
   Besides, P&amp;G launched its calcium-enriched juices three
years ago and it hasn't made a big difference in P&amp;G's share
of the juice market. "People aren't enthralled," Mr. Pirko
said.
   The study, funded by P&amp;G and the National Institutes of
Health, was conducted on 50 sets of identical twins, from
five to 14 years old. Testing twins eliminates genetic
differences and helps control other factors, like environment
and diet.
   Each twin ate a daily diet containing about 900 milligrams
of calcium. One twin also received a 1,000 milligram tablet
of the calcium supplement each day. The preliminary results
show substantial improvements in bone density in the forearm
of the twin receiving the supplement. Precise measures of the
improvement weren't available because the tests will continue
for another year, researchers said.
   The only place this supplement is found is in P&amp;G's Citrus
Hill Plus Calcium juices. To get the same dose, consumers
would have to drink three, six-ounce servings a day.
   Previous research had already indicated that the
supplement is more fully absorbed than calcium carbonate, a
common calcium supplement, said Judy Z. Miller, associate
professor of medicine at Indiana University.
   "Calcium is calcium," she said. "But this supplement makes
more calcium available to the body."
   Others were skeptical of the supplement's impact on
disease, such as osteoporosis, a brittle bone disease that
affects about 20 million people in the U.S. "Children that
get supplemental calcium or a high-calcium diet, regardless
of the source, will end up with denser bones," said James
Simon, a reproductive endocrinologist at Georgetown
University. "Any extrapolation on the risks of osteoporosis
{later in life} is unwarranted."
   P&amp;G officials said they don't have immediate plans to
launch new promotions of the Citrus Hill products or to
introduce new products containing the supplement.
