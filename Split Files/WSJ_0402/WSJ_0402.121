   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. regained its spot as the
world's leading exporter last year after losing it to West
Germany, according to the International Monetary Fund.
   The IMF said U.S. foreign sales were valued at $364
billion for 1989, compared with $341.4 billion for West
Germany. Japan was third with $273.9 billion.

   West Germany, which toppled the U.S. from the No. 1 trade
spot in 1986, and Japan both had trade surpluses, while the
U.S. still had a deficit of $128.9 billion, down from $137.1
billion, according to the IMF's trade calculations.
   The deficit is because of the fact that the U.S. is also
the world's greatest importer. Its imports also grew rapidly,
to $492.9 billion from $459.5 billion.
   The West German surplus, currently the world's largest,
amounted to $71.4 billion, and Japan's was $63.9 billion, the
IMF reported.
   The Commerce Department, using different means of
calculating the trade imbalance, has put the 1989 merchandise
trade deficit at $109 billion.
   Of six major countries, the U.S. had the largest increase
in foreign sales, 12.5%, the IMF said. West German exports
also rose, by 5.6% to $341 billion. Since East Germany also
is an important trader, a reunified Germany may take over the
world's first place as exporter once again.
