   Howard Savings Bank, Livingston, N.J., said it plans to
add about $30 million to its loan-loss reserves for the first
quarter, causing a loss of about $17 million, or $1.16 a
share. In the 1989 first quarter, Howard earned $8.5 million,
or 59 cents a share.
   Howard also said its board suspended payment of the
quarterly dividend.

   Leo J. Rogers Jr., president, said the additional reserves
became necessary "because of both the continuing weakness in
the region's real estate markets and a further deterioration
in loans previously identified by the bank as problem loans."
   After the addition to reserves, the bank's allowance for
loan losses will be about $112 million, compared with $84.9
million at the end of 1989. The bank anticipates that its
nonperforming loans will increase to about $410 million at
the end of the first quarter from $314.8 million at year end.
Howard said it remains in compliance with all applicable
capital standards.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Howard shares
closed at $5.125, down 12.5 cents.
