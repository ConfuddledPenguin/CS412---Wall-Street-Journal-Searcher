   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The West German chemical group
Hoechst AG said it agreed to merge its latex paints business
with that of Mitsubishi Kasei Corp. of Japan. Financial terms
weren't disclosed.
   Hoechst said the companies' respective paint operations
will be placed into an existing 50-50 joint venture company,
Kasei Hoechst Co. Ltd., which for the past 23 years has
produced and marketed reactive dyes.

   The agreement for the new business cooperation still needs
the approval of "relevant authorities," Hoechst said, adding
that the merger is planned to take effect July 1.
