   One counts paper clips. The other counts takeover targets.
Together, they are trying to make one of the biggest
acquisitions in the history of the life-insurance industry.
   Torchmark Corp.'s cost-conscious chairman and chief
executive, Ronald K. Richey, and its aggressive president,
Jon W. Rotenstreich, may be just the combination needed to
pull off the company's $6.3 billion bid for rival American
General Corp., analysts say. The merger would create the
largest publicly held insurance company in the country.

   That American General, the nation's fourth-largest
publicly held insurer, dwarfs Torchmark in size seems to make
little difference. Torchmark, as Messrs. Richey and
Rotenstreich note, has posted an impressive record in the
four years that the two have been at the helm of the
Birmingham, Ala., company. Torchmark's expenses are half of
the industry average; it has amassed enough cash in recent
years to have bought back one-third of its stock; and, within
its Southeast market, it's one of the dominant players in all
its insurance lines -- life, health and property-casualty.
   "I think the beauty of this thing is the difference of
perspective that we have," says Mr. Richey. The chairman, who
is regarded as one of the industry's top executives, handles
the day-to-day operations, all the while scouring Torchmark
for possible cost-savings. Mr. Rotenstreich, in the meantime,
manages investments and targets new acquisitions.
   Houston-based American General responded cooly to
Torchmark's initial proposal of $50-a-share in cash and
securities. American General's chairman, Harold S. Hook, said
last week that mergers are "something that {Torchmark
doesn't} know very much about."
   Torchmark, meanwhile, is pressing ahead. The company is
apparently preparing for a proxy fight to oust directors of
American General at the latter's May 2 annual meeting. Also
last week, Torchmark went to court to force American General
to hand over a list of its shareholders. American General
complied but has countersued, arguing that Torchmark has
missed the deadline to nominate a slate for American
General's board.
   Torchmark said Friday that it will review the shareholder
list and plans to announce today what its next steps will be.
   "In terms of what these guys have accomplished, it's hard
to bet against them -- even on this," says Joan Zief, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch Research/U.S. Adds Herbert E.
Goodfriend, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.:
"These aren't the typical backslapping, sales-force
motivators you find running most life-insurance companies, in
that maximizing {shareholder} return is {their} first
{priority}. That's refreshing."
   Mr. Richey joined Torchmark in 1980 when the company, then
known as Liberty National Life Insurance Co., acquired Globe
Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co. of Oklahoma City. Mr. Richey
had been chairman and chief executive of Globe Life. Flush
with cash, Liberty National was seeking to diversify by
acquiring other insurers, expanding into mutual funds, and
even starting an oil and gas investment unit.
   To Mr. Richey fell the task of sewing the company together
and maintaining its traditionally strong earnings growth.
That he did. Between 1980 and 1985, he produced a 20% average
annual growth in earnings per share and a 34% average annual
increase in Torchmark's stock price. To get those returns --
and the in-house nickname "Mr. Efficiency Himself" -- he took
an axe to the company, consolidating sales territories,
automating the company's back shop and chopping out layers of
management.
   By 1986, when he was named chairman, the company again was
awash in cash, and Mr. Richey began a search for a president
with investment expertise, primarily because tax reform had
made all-cash acquisitions less attractive. Enter Mr.
Rotenstreich, who was already serving as a Torchmark
director. The two men had originally met as adversaries when
Mr. Rotenstreich, as an investment banker at Salomon Brothers
Inc., had represented Liberty National in its pursuit of
Globe. Say Mr. Richey: "I never thought they paid enough for
Globe, and he was the primary reason."
   Mr. Rotenstreich, though a Birmingham native, prefers Wall
Street to the South. From an antique-decorated office
overlooking Central Park, he manages a $3 billion investment
portfolio with just eight people.
   Together, analysts say, there is not a better top
management duo in the insurance industry. Torchmark's return
on equity has been above 20% for the past four years, about
double its peer-group average. Primarily through Mr.
Rotenstreich's efforts -- including the repurchase of about
23 million Torchmark shares -- the company's stock price more
than doubled between 1987 and 1989. Like most insurers,
however, Torchmark's profit growth has been squeezed recently
by smaller growth in premiums.
   To remedy the problem, Messrs. Richey and Rotenstreich
decided in November 1988 to launch a $318 million hostile
tender offer for Kansas City Life Insurance Co. to build on
Torchmark's insurance franchise. "One of our major units is
based in Kansas, so we thought it was a nice geographic fit,"
says Mr. Richey. "There was also an opportunity to realize
some {cost} efficiencies in their operation."
   But Kansas City Life, which is controlled by the Bixby
family, rejected the offer less than a month later. Mr.
Rotenstreich says Torchmark simply took the cash and
repurchased an additional 1.6 million of its shares at an
average price of $34.35. "It obviously didn't hurt us any,"
he says. "Our per-share profits were up again over 20% last
year."
   The team now has its sights set on much bigger game. The
pair believes it can squeeze the same cost-efficiencies out
of American General that it did with Torchmark. Says Mr.
Richey: "You can see that a lot can be done with an even
larger organization in our business."
   "With consolidation becoming a growing trend in this
industry," Mr. Richey says, "we're talking about creating a
large, public company with a substantial {market} penetration
and cash-flow position."
