   The nation's health-care companies are expected to finish
the first quarter in robust shape.
   Medical-supply firms are expected to report earnings
growth of about 14% on average, analysts said, even though
sales growth has remained at about 10% over the past two
quarters -- a reflection of the medical industry's efforts to
hold down expenditures.

   But the industry may face the threat of an economic
slowdown in 1990, an occurence that analysts said could
prompt insurers to further intensify pressure on hospitals to
cut costs. But even then, analysts add, the effect might be
minimal on suppliers, which have managed to hold down their
prices in recent quarters.
   Among the medical-supply concerns, Abbott Laboratories is
expected to report 15% growth in first-quarter earnings.
Sales for the Abbott Park, Ill., medical supplier rose 11% in
the fourth quarter to $1.46 billion, topping an 8.3% rise the
previous quarter.
   Baxter International Inc. is expected to report a 14%
increase in net income, with per-share earnings of 39 cents,
up from 34 cents a year ago. The Deerfield, Ill., company is
"on the verge of a significant restructuring move" that may
include corporate staff cuts and the sale of assets, said
David J. Lothson, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   A few companies aren't likely to share in the overall
bright outlook. C.R. Bard Inc. is expected to report a 58%
drop in earnings, to about 16 cents a share from 38 cents a
year earlier. Since last summer, the Murray Hill, N.J.,
company has had to pull three angioplasty catheters from the
market after the Food and Drug Administration raised
questions about their design. The company is awaiting
approval to reintroduce the products.
   Hospital-management companies, benefiting from
restructuring and stabilized admission rates, continue to
report strong earnings.
   Despite some softness in the market for adolescent
psychiatric services, Los Angeles-based National Medical
Enterprises Inc. yesterday reported net income of $62.7
million, or 77 cents a share for its third quarter, ended
Feb. 28, up from $49.4 million, or 67 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Humana Inc. reported earnings of $75.8 million, or 75
cents a share, for its second quarter, ended Feb. 28,
compared with $62.4 million, or 63 cents a share, in the
year-ago period. Analysts praised the Louisville, Ky., care
provider for securing a supply of patients for its hospitals
by boosting enrollment in its health maintenance
organizations.
