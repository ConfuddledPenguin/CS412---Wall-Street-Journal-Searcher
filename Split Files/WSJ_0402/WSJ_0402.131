   T&amp;N PLC of Britain said it began its $190 million, or
$17.30-a-share, tender offer for J.P. Industries Inc. The
offer also includes the assumption of $185 million of J.P.
Industries's debt.
   The offer expires midnight April 26 unless extended; it is
conditioned on T&amp;N's ability to attract at least a majority
of J.P. Industries's stock.

   T&amp;N, based in Manchester, England, said it plans to merge
its U.S. auto parts operations into J.P. Industries and make
the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based car, truck and locomotive
engine-parts manufacturer a T&amp;N subsidiary.
   Under terms of the definitive merger agreement reached
last week, T&amp;N will receive $12 million if J.P. Industries is
acquired by another party.
