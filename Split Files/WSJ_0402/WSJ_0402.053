   NEW YORK -- The threat of a strike at the troubled New
York Daily News looms larger than ever following the
expiration on Friday of a contract covering the 10 unions at
the country's largest metropolitan daily newspaper.
   Both Daily News management and union leaders remain at the
bargaining table. However, after months of bitter verbal
attacks by both sides, there's no sign of a truce. Observers
of the negotiations say the Daily News, which is owned by
Chicago-based Tribune Co., could face a walkout by union
members within a month.

   The industry's most acrimonious newspaper labor battle in
years comes at a bad time for the Daily News, which has
posted losses for most of the last decade. It faces increased
competition from another tabloid, Times Mirror Co.'s New York
Newsday, at a time when the New York advertising market is
the softest in years.
   Almost every scenario the Daily News faces is a dire one,
at least for the near future. Management has demanded major
cost and work concessions from the unions and says it is
prepared to publish and distribute the paper in the event of
a strike. Even so, the Daily News stands to lose significant
advertising and circulation.
   Union leaders say they hope to avoid a strike, yet several
of the unions have voted strike authorizations. Many workers
face the loss of their jobs permanently if they do walk off
their jobs. If there is a strike, the unions threaten to lead
a boycott of the paper by readers and advertisers.
   The 1980s nearly ruined the Daily News and strained
Tribune Co.'s commitment to publishing in New York. The Daily
News had revenue of $420 million in 1989, yet the paper was
only marginally profitable. Over the past decade, the paper
has lost $115 million on $4 billion in revenue. Average daily
paid circulation has fallen by 400,000 copies since 1979; as
of Sept. 30, 1989, the paper's circulation was 1.2 million,
down 7% from 1988.
   The union is charging mismanagement, and claims the
Tribune intends to win concessions, then sell off the
newspaper. James Hoge, publisher of the Daily News, is "a
sociable guy, but as a publisher he's a 4 on a scale of 1 to
10," said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council. "The News has bum management."
   Daily News executives blame the heavy financial burden of
a bloated union work force. About 50% of the paper's revenue
goes to cover employee compensation, compared with 25% to 30%
at most other major metropolitan papers.
   As for selling the paper, media analysts doubt it will
take place. "New York is the biggest media market in the U.S.
The Tribune won't give that up," said Peter Appert, analyst
at C.J. Lawrence. "If they can get even a mediocre profit
from that huge base of revenues, it's worth pursuing."
   The troubling situation is a familiar one for Tribune Co.
In 1985, at the company's flagship Chicago Tribune, the
pressmen and printers unions were broken in a prolonged and
violent strike. The Tribune management won control of hiring
and eliminated costly labor abuses. The Daily News is looking
for the same and Mr. Hoge claims that with concessions in
hand, the Tribune will invest $500 million in new presses
able to print color pages.
