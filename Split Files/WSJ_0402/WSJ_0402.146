   Colorado-Ute Electric Association said it filed a
voluntary petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code to resolve its financial
difficulties.
   The Montrose, Colo., wholesale electric-power producer
said the filing follows the suspension of merger negotiations
with TriState Generation and Transmission Association. The
negotiations were suspended because of a tentative decision
by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission on March 8 to
reduce Colorado-Ute's wholesale rates to its 14-member
distribution systems.

   Colorado-Ute said the bankruptcy-law filing won't affect
its normal operations. About 200,000 customers receive
electricity from its systems.
   The utility said that Tri-State has withheld advances of
funds under the revolving loan agreement and that
Colorado-Ute "can no longer operate without protection under
the federal Bankruptcy Code."
   Colorado-Ute said its situation has been further "confused
by conflicting orders" from regulators concerning the
wholesale rate it should charge its member-owners. It said
its directors will discuss the matter at the company's next
regularly scheduled board meeting in April.
