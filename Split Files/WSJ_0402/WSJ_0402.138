   PHILADELPHIA -- Consolidated Rail Corp. said it plans to
consolidate its headquarters here.
   The railroad, which operates in the Northeast and Midwest,
said it will lease 750,000 square feet of office space in a
tower to be built at Commerce Square, 20th and Market
streets. Conrail won't have an ownership interest in the
41-story, 950,000-square-foot structure, which it said it
expects to begin occupying in early 1992.

   Conrail said the move will allow the company to
consolidate its four central Philadelphia offices, with more
than 3,000 total employees, in one location, "increasing our
efficiency and productivity." The company didn't disclose
rental costs or say whether the new space will result in net
savings.
   The building is being developed by a joint venture of
Maguire Thomas Partners, Los Angeles, and International
Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y.
