   HALUVHIMBI, South Africa -- "No one is free when others
are oppressed," says a sticker welcoming visitors to the tiny
house on the mango forest's edge. Behind the slogan lives the
Rev. Zwo Nevhutalu, tall and rail-thin, a build suited to a
life on the run from the autocratic authorities here in the
black homeland of Venda.
   "We live like rabbits," he says. Two weeks earlier he was
scurrying through the thick bush, avoiding a roundup of the
leaders of a mass rally celebrating the release of black
nationalist Nelson Mandela from 27 years in prison. That was
followed by a weeklong strike of Venda teachers, magistrates
and civil servants and a surprising protest over working
conditions by the police in this homeland tucked away in the
remote northeast corner of South Africa. Now that his voice
of dissent against the repressive homeland government is part
of a bigger chorus, the Lutheran pastor feels safe to return
to his parish.

   "Even those people who have been hiding behind benches and
under beds are now coming out saying enough is enough," he
says.
   Since the government in Pretoria suddenly unbanned 60
opposition groups in February, including Mr. Mandela's
African National Congress, the peasants of Venda have poured
out of their mud huts with one basic demand: an immediate end
to the homeland system. That system is the grossest
manifestation of South Africa's zealous effort -- known as
grand apartheid -- to separate white from black.
   South Africa's political analysts call it a "revolution of
raised expectations." The political reforms, coming after
years of repression, have prompted black demands for an
overnight cleansing of the poisons of apartheid. Every day
brings new protests across the country. Teachers demonstrate
against the inferior black education system, township
residents march against high rents and community squalor,
prison warders strike over poor treatment and segregation in
the prison administration.
   The result has been a wave of unrest that threatens the
white government's efforts to begin power-sharing
negotiations with the black majority. Last week, police
opened fire on black protesters in the township of Sebokeng,
south of Johannesburg, killing nine and injuring more than
400. A few days later, the ANC indefinitely postponed the
opening round of talks with the government scheduled for
April 11.
   The unrest has been particularly acute in the 10 black
homelands. In KwaZulu, more than 200 people have died in
recent weeks during fighting between supporters of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's homeland government and ANC-allied
groups opposed to the homeland system. And in the four
homelands granted independence by South Africa (while
Pretoria treats them as sovereign states, the rest of the
world refuses to recognize them), the impoverished residents
are pushing to reincorporate the territories into South
Africa.
   In Ciskei, on the Indian Ocean coast, disgruntled
soldiers, favoring reincorporation, led a successful coup,
prompting several days of celebration and looting that left
dozens dead and injured. In Bophuthatswana, homeland police
opened fire on residents who angrily took to the streets
after the president said reincorporation would never happen
"in 100 years." In Venda, the recent wave of strikes and
protests has led President Frank Ravele to say he favors
negotiations on reincorporation. But his opponents say there
is nothing to negotiate; they want Mr. Ravele and his entire
government to resign.
   "If Ravele doesn't make an announcement soon, there will
be protests until he does," says Phanuel Mphaphuli, the local
representative of the South African Council of Churches,
which opposes homelands. Last week, Venda was rocked by three
bomb blasts. Though no one was hurt, one damaged the
Parliament building.
   The homelands pose a dilemma for Pretoria. President F.W.
de Klerk has taken bold steps toward ending apartheid, but as
long as the homelands remain, apartheid will be alive and
well. The monster, in effect, has turned on its creator.
While the government acknowledges that artificial geographic
segregation has failed, it is battling to control the tempo
of change and doesn't want to yield to street protest by
unceremoniously dumping its loyal homeland leaders. In future
black-white negotiations, Pretoria would like to have them on
its side.
   The idea of the homelands, conceived in the 1950s, was to
rid South Africa of black citizens. In a madly ambitious
scheme of social engineering, Pretoria divided the black
population into 10 tribal groups and then herded them into
separate "bantustans," each with its own government. A steady
stream of money from white South African taxpayers would make
sure they stayed put.
   But the plan failed miserably in practice. Many blacks,
despite forced removals, continued to flock to the urban
areas, where the white-run economy depends on their labor.
The homeland governments were derided as Pretoria's puppets.
The huge South African subsidies fostered rampant corruption.
Despite attractive tax schemes, most businessmen stayed away,
except for casino moguls and Taiwanese shoemakers. Instead of
viable states, the territories became cesspools of poverty
and shameful examples of the huge gap between white and black
living standards in South Africa.
   Heading east on Route 524, there is no sign alerting
travelers that they are leaving "white" South Africa and
entering Venda. But it is soon obvious. The mango trees, once
in neat groves, now grow wild; brick farmhouses are now mud
huts; the feeder roads are now dirt instead of concrete; the
roadside fruit stands are now auto repair shops.
   Cut off from the wealth of South Africa, most of the
500,000 Vendans rely on subsistence agriculture. The
government is a cabal of village chiefs, many of whom are
ill-educated. A couple of cabinet ministers have been
implicated in ritual murders. One allegedly buried a woman's
head in front of his house, hoping to derive some mystical
power. Repression of political opposition -- in particular
the outspoken Lutheran Church -- has been brutal.
   When Venda took its leave from South Africa in 1979,
following a dubious election in which the new government
received scant support, Tshenuwani Farisani, the dean of the
Lutheran Church in Venda, agreed to preach at the
independence festivities provided he could choose his own
sermon. He focused on the parable of the foolish man who
built his house on sand. Early the next morning his home was
raided, beginning several years of repeated detention and
torture.
   Today, Rev. Farisani is in the U.S., having left Venda in
1987 to seek medical treatment. But since then, his lonely
cry of protest has been rippling through the mango forests.
Now, hardly a day goes by when some section of the population
isn't protesting, be it against witchcraft or low salaries.
People move around proudly wearing ANC T-shirts. Even the
police salute protesters with clenched fists.
   "We must give thanks for what is happening now even before
we reach the day of freedom," says Rev. Nevhutalu. "Our
people aren't allowing themselves to be taken for granted
anymore."
