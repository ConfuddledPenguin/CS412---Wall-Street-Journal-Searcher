   Impact of Profit Drop
   May Have Lessened

   Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the economy's
ability to keep expanding despite so many well-publicized
problems involves profits, which are supposed to be
capitalism's lifeblood. It's true, as Edward Yardeni,
economics director for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
observes, that "corporate profits have been in a recession
since the second quarter of last year." Yet, as the second
quarter of 1990 begins, the general level of business
activity appears still to be rising, and most forecasters
share Mr. Yardeni's view that "the economy will grow all
year." How, with profits sagging, is such an economic
performance possible?
   The explanation, according to Lacy H. Hunt, chief
economist of the investment firm of Carroll McEntree &amp;
McGinley Inc., is that profits occupy a sharply diminished
role in today's economy. He reckons, accordingly, that to
drag the economy into a new recession profits would have to
decline far longer and more steeply than they have done so
far. He doubts this will happen and endorses the consensus
forecast that the economy will continue to expand, at the
least, through 1990.

   The shrinking role of profits is evident, as Mr. Hunt
says, in comparisons of profits and the gross national
product, the broadest measure of overall economic activity.
In the 1960s, amid the longest economic expansion in the
history of the U.S. business cycle, corporate profits,
adjusted for inventory gains or losses and for depreciation,
reached 11.7% of GNP. This percentage fell to a low of 6.9%
near the trough of the subsequent 1969-70 recession. Since
then, as the chart below shows, the pattern has been for the
percentages to be lower at both expansionary high points and
recessionary low points.
                                                                                                       

   The latest reading, for last year's fourth quarter, is
5.3%. This is appreciably below the high for this expansion
of 7.3%, set in the second quarter of 1984, but it remains
well above the low for the 1981-82 recession of 4.5%. It also
is substantially higher than where Mr. Hunt, given the
pattern of progressively falling levels of both the high and
low readings, places the new "recessionary range." For him to
become concerned about profits dragging the economy into a
recession in coming months, he says, they would have to fall
to about 3% of GNP.
   Mr. Hunt shares the view of most forecasters that such a
decline will not occur. The consensus is that economic growth
will slowly accelerate as the year goes along, and in the
process profits will increase. For instance, 51 forecasters
polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz.,
estimate on average that the economy will grow 2.3% annually
in the year's last half and profits will rise as well.
   In the last three months of 1989, pretax profits continued
a decline that began early last year. But the rate of decline
slowed markedly to 0.5% from 7.1% in the previous quarter.
And, on an after-tax basis, profits edged up in the quarter,
reversing a yearlong slide.
   Profits, it should be noted, tend to lead the economy's
ups and downs. The government, in fact, continues to classify
them as a leading economic indicator, normally rising or
falling several months before such broader gauges as
employment and industrial production follow suit. Mr. Hunt
agrees that profits still tend to lead the economy, but he
adds that nowadays "the economy clearly can manage to keep
expanding through the sort of profit decline that once would
have signaled a recession."
   One reason, he says, is that service businesses, which
tend to operate on slimmer profit margins, now play a larger
economic role. More importantly, the huge increase in
corporate indebtedness in recent years has served to reduce
profits. Corporations' net interest costs -- interest expense
less interest income -- reached a record 52% of profits in
last year's fourth quarter, up from less than 2% a
quarter-century ago.
                                                                                                       

   The interest that corporations pay on their bonds and
other borrowings, of course, may be deducted from their
profits, reducing taxes. The upshot is that many firms that
have undergone leveraged restructuring now show weak profits
or lose money, and yet remain in operation, providing jobs
that help sustain overall economic activity.
                                                                                                       

   The economy, to be sure, cannot continue indefinitely to
expand if profits keep dropping. Many analysts, in fact,
attribute much of the economy's recent sluggishness to the
profit decline of the past year and its impact on corporate
hiring and spending. And some forecasters remain convinced
the profit decline signals a recession is near.
   Perhaps so. But with a reduced role for profits, that
possibility may prove less likely than in the past.
