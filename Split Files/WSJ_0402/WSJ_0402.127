   NEW YORK -- Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton said William F. Stasior

Cyrus F. Freidheim Jr., managing director, U.S. management
consulting, was appointed to the additional position of vice
chairman. In the new post, Mr. Freidheim, 54 years old, is
responsible for leading the firm's efforts toward
globalization of management and technology services.

   As president, Mr. Stasior, 49, formerly president of Booz
Allen's Information Technology Center, will be responsible
for the firm's day-to-day operations. A Booz Allen spokesman
said the president's post hasn't been filled since 1984, when
R. Michael McCullough, 51, took over as chairman.
   John Rhodes has retired from Booz Allen as vice chairman,
but the spokesman said Mr. Freidheim isn't succeeding Mr.
Rhodes.
