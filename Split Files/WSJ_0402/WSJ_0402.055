RETAILING (RET)
</IN>
<LP>
   You've shopped till you dropped. But where do you put it
all when you get it home?
   The solution is to shop a little more, according to a
growing group of retailers who specialize in so-called
organization materials, items designed to tidy every inch of
the home and office.

   Organizing stores are sprouting in upscale shopping areas
in California and along the East Coast, and some retailers
have expanded nationwide via direct-mail catalogs. Most
target affluent consumers by emphasizing efficiency and time
management, as well as home and hearth.
   The businesses feed off demographic and cultural shifts
that are likely to shape the 1990s. Women who cleaned up
after the family a generation ago are out working. The number
of households is increasing as average household size
shrinks, meaning more but smaller residences. And as a
society, Americans are probably the most acquisitive people
in history.
   "We're in an accumulation mode that knows no bounds," says
Stephanie Culp, an organizing consultant and a founding
member of the National Association of Professional
Organizers. "So people find themselves in a terrible space
crunch."
   Hold Everything, a retail and catalog seller of organizing
goods, plans an ambitious national expansion this year. Kent
C. Larson, president of Williams-Sonoma Inc., the San
Francisco kitchenware merchant that owns the business,
attributes the boom in part to soaring real estate prices and
a tendency for people to entertain and relax at home. Hold
Everything, which started as a small catalog in 1982, plans
to open stores in New York, Washington and other Eastern
cities to complement its expanding chain in the West.
   The nascent organizing business is also taking advantage
of a retailing shift. Much of what they stock is designed to
complement personal computers, electronic entertainment
components and other modern inventions. But other goods are
low-tech housekeeping staples from the 1940s and 1950s, such
as coated wire cupboard shelves and sweater drying racks --
items once found in department store notions sections, dry
goods stores and five-and-dime stores, which have virtually
died out in many areas of the country.
   Maynard Hale Lyndon and Lu Wendel Lyndon, architectural
design specialists, say much has changed since they founded
the Placewares chain in Boston in 1977. Consumers are more
interested in recycling and efficient use of resources, Mr.
Lyndon says, and American manufacturers are finally producing
quality products once exclusively designed in Europe.
Placewares, which just opened it seventh New England store,
also sells via catalog and is planning further growth.
   Lillian Vernon Corp., the specialty catalog concern,
reports that some of its longtime storage and organization
items such as newspaper racks and recycling aids have
suddenly surged in popularity.
   Although the organizing business doesn't have any firm
statistics of its own, the National Housewares Manufacturers
Association says the general categories of bath, laundry,
closet and storage wares in 1988 accounted for about 4.6% of
the $35.2 billion of housewares sales, or a total of about
$1.62 billion.
   An organizing store's inventory generally includes
kitchen, utility room, bathroom, garage and home office
items, and occasionally furniture and tableware as well. But
some, such as Organizer's Paradise in Los Angeles, take an
even broader approach, pitching their stores as stylish
outlets where shoppers can buy anything from modular cupboard
organizers to a $4,000 electric blue ultrasuede swing settee.
"There was a real void in the market for upscale products,"
says Sandy Chism, who along with her daughter, Christi, runs
three stores in the fashionable Westwood, Beverly Hills and
West Hollywood areas.
   Merchants who haven't organized their own business plans
in the new field may find a closet full of problems --
pricing being a big one. Many organization stores offer such
sticker-shock inducers as $25 plastic sock storage boxes and
$8 assortments of decorative paper clips.
   Home-improvement stores, hardware stores and discount
stores are beginning to stock more organizing items, often at
prices that specialty stores can't match. The specialty
stores figure they can overcome the price gap by offering
higher quality and better selection and focusing on smaller
organizing niches.
   As with any new retailing concept, experts note, targeting
the right customers can be crucial to success.
   "A retailer is going to have higher sales and faster
{merchandise turnover} if the focus is on one area," says
Marcia Aaron, a specialty retail analyst with Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. By moving too far into other
areas such as furniture or other housewares, retailers can
dilute their customer base.
   Ms. Aaron says the organizing and storage market has been
underserved up to now. "But there are a lot of people trying
to get in," she says. "And eventually, some will have to pull
out because it's just too competitive."
   Retailers say it can be a challenge to make people see a
need for organization wares. "Most people just don't go
around thinking, `I really need a laundry-room organizer,'"
says a sales clerk at a Los Angeles-area store. "But once you
get them in here, you can't get them out."
   Many shoppers agree. "You get caught up," says Mara
Slutsky of Boston, a customer at Placewares. She bought a
shower organizer and colored hooks for the bathroom, and says
she had to restrain herself from buying "everything
imaginable."
   Ms. Slutsky's only criticism of the merchandise is a
common one among several firms' customers: "After a while,
everything looks alike," she says of the sleek,
modern-looking wares. Nonetheless, she says, she plans
another shopping spree when she moves to a new apartment.
   Lori Lavin, a West Los Angeles resident, gushes over the
merchandise in a new 13,000-square-foot Organizer's Paradise
store as she wheels a wire shopping cart piled with
contemporary black desktop items and colorful kitchen
gadgets. In two visits, she says, she's plunked down more
than $130 to update her closets, kitchen and desk. "I don't
have the time to dig through a lot of junk," she says of her
cleanup efforts.
   That, retailers say, is an important selling point. "Most
people who are space-conscious are time-sensitive as well,"
says Carol Fraser, director of the Hold Everything catalog.
The stores tap into the same mentality that has made
enormous, multisectioned diary planners such a hit.
   Some say that the merchandise appeals to customers because
it allows them to attribute their sloppiness to a technical,
rather than a personal, flaw. "You're not buying a crutch for
your character," says Dr. Jerald Jellison, a psychology
professor at the University of Southern California. "You just
don't have the right equipment" to be neat.
