   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit of
American Continental Corp. against federal regulators it had
accused of damaging its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association
subsidiary by leaking confidential information to the press.
   Federal Judge Richard M. Bilby acted on a motion by
American Continental to dismiss the case without prejudice,
meaning that it may be refiled or reopened. But Judge Bilby
added that unless American Continental takes action by July
1, the case would be dismissed with prejudice.

   American Continental filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last April 13. The
government seized Lincoln Savings, of Irvine, Calif., the
next day. More than 23,000 investors claim they weren't
warned of the risks in buying uninsured junk bonds of Lincoln
Savings. They lost $200 million when the thrift failed.
   Judge Bilby precipitated the company's March 7 dismissal
motion when he barred American Continental from continuing to
pay attorneys to pursue the case. He said he feared that
attorneys' fees would use up the equity in American
Continental.
   James Feder, an attorney for American Continental, said it
wasn't clear whether the firm will attempt to refile or
reopen the suit. "We don't have the time and resources to
pursue this suit with the other litigation we have going," he
said.
   Government regulators have estimated that the Lincoln
failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   American Continental had argued that top thrift regulators
regularly leaked information to the press that hurt the
survival possibilities of Lincoln Savings. Named as
defendants were M. Danny Wall, former director of the Office
of Thrift Supervision; Darrel W. Dochow, acting principal
supervisory agent for Lincoln, and William K. Black, general
counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in San Francisco.
   The defendants couldn't be reached for comment.
