   It's a clear, sunny day -- the latitude is tropical but
the altitude is lofty. Gathered in crisp uniforms on a green
lawn are a hundred or so students of Gayaza High School, "the
oldest girls' school in Uganda." The camera pans their
smoothly sculpted faces, each lovelier than the last, while
their angelic voices pour forth a song to welcome an honored
guest. In this image of pure yet exotic beauty, we glimpse
why the British once called Uganda "the pearl of Africa."
   It's an image I grew up with, although I have never been
to East Africa. When I was seven years old, my physician
father was persuaded, by a former patient who had gone to
Uganda to teach in an Anglican missionary school, to pay the
modest school fees of a boy from a mountain village who
otherwise would have been unable to continue his education.
Since the boy was my age, the two of us became pen pals, and
my personal tie to Uganda was formed.

   The obvious thing to say now is that my pen pal (whom I
have met twice, in this country) is still alive. Mention
Uganda nowadays, and people do not think of schoolgirls
singing on a hillside above Lake Victoria. On the contrary,
they think -- or try not to think -- of the devastating
horror of the past 20 years, as the northern-based armies of
Milton Obote and Idi Amin imposed a brutal and genocidal
tyranny on their longstanding southern rivals.
   The horror has abated since 1986, when the exiled leader
Yoweri Museveni seized the government and instituted a policy
of amnesty and national reconciliation. But now another
horror is loose in Uganda -- AIDS. While some epidemiologists
debate the theory that one of the AIDS viruses originated in
the area of the Ugandan-Tanzanian border, others are
(rightly) more concerned with fighting the disease, which,
according to some estimates, now infects 800,000 of 16
million Ugandans.
   Which brings us back to Gayaza, where the guest of honor
is not a visiting bishop or a distinguished alumna, but a
popular singer named Philly Bongoley Lutaaya, who is dying of
AIDS. Mr. Lutaaya's public announcement of his condition, and
his travels throughout Uganda to educate his people about
AIDS, is the subject of "Born in Africa," a special combined
edition of "Frontline" and "The AIDS Quarterly" airing
tomorrow (9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS; check local listings).
   In Africa, AIDS is called "Slim," for reasons that are
obvious when we look at Mr. Lutaaya. Frail as a reed and
unhealthily reddish in color (except for the purple welts on
his skin), he wears wraparound sunglasses to protect his eyes
while delivering his message to the students: "Let us do our
best to have a virus-free young generation. It's easy to
avoid getting the virus. I beseech you, please be careful in
the way you handle yourselves. We need you."
   The message seems simple enough, and certainly Mr. Lutaaya
(who died in December) is an eloquent messenger. Early in the
film, the doctor who had been treating Mr. Lutaaya in
Stockholm describes the severity of the infections, tumors
and foot sores that, in his view, already have doomed the
singer to a bedridden existence. Yet Mr. Lutaaya defies this
prognosis by getting up, recording what would become a hit
song about AIDS, and then making the arduous journey back to
Uganda.
   Yet the message gets more complicated as we follow Mr.
Lutaaya through an itinerary that includes a great many stops
besides Gayaza. Part of the fascination of this film (made by
the award-winning Canadian film makers Virginia Storring and
John Zaritskyis) is its vivid portrait of contemporary Africa
as a place where the incursion of the modern world is both a
blessing and a curse.
   While still in Kampala, Mr. Lutaaya attends a party in the
neighborhood bar where he got his start as a musician. Here
we are reminded of the extreme moral permissiveness that has
existed in urban Africa for the past several decades. This
particular gathering is a sober one, but it's clear that the
bar is usually a spot where the music jumps, the beer flows
and traditional sexual morality -- whether tribal, Christian
or Moslem -- falls by the wayside.
   Such "liberated" environments attract young, uprooted
people who tend to be malnourished and afflicted with various
maladies, including venereal diseases, that have gone
untreated since the collapse of the Ugandan health system in
the early 1970s. Most researchers agree that it is this
combination of unfettered sexual activity and poor health
that has caused AIDS to become a heterosexually transmitted
epidemic in Africa.
   Therefore, in the spirit of scientific reason, Mr. Lutaaya
tries to convince people in mosques, churches, remote
villages (including his own) and the depopulated "ghost
towns" along the Trans-African Highway that AIDS is a
public-health hazard, not the work of witchcraft or a
punishment sent by God. He tactfully explains how the virus
is transmitted, and urges his listeners not to shun or
mistreat its victims.
   Here the complications begin, however. By insisting on a
non-judgmental attitude, Mr. Lutaaya may be inadvertently
furthering the process of secularization that contributed to
the problem in the first place. Given the role of religious
differences in Uganda's civil strife, we understand why Mr.
Lutaaya disapproves when a group of youngsters presents him
with a song blaming "rebellious" and "promiscuous" people for
bringing AIDS into their village, where it now kills the
innocent.
   Yet Mr. Lutaaya is caught on the horns of a dilemma, and
he is hardly alone. Public-health officials and religious
leaders throughout Africa agree that the best weapon against
AIDS is a return to monogamy, or (in the case of Islam and
traditional religions) polygamy, as long as husbands and
wives both remain faithful. But the only way to restore these
moral codes is to strengthen belief, which is also the source
of superstition and intolerance.
   Can people adopt strict moral behavior without rendering
strict judgment on the behavior of others? In the West, where
AIDS may not reach epidemic levels, we can afford this kind
of pragmatic pseudosolution. For us, the horns of the age-old
dilemma of religious toleration have become comfortably
blunt. But the same cannot be said of Africa, as this film
ably demonstrates. The fascination, and the sorrow, of Africa
is that it is a place where all human problems show up with
the sharpness of a razor.
