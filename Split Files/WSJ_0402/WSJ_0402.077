   DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. and MGF Oil Corp., a Midland,
Texas, energy firm, said they completed their agreements to
sell all MGF common stock held by Southmark and MGF's
minority shareholders to closely held Kaiser-Francis Oil Co.,
a Tulsa, Okla., energy concern.
   Southmark had owned 94.1% of MGF's common shares

   Under the agreement, MGF sold its assets to Kaiser-Francis
for $26 million. Following the asset sale, Southmark acquired
the 5.9% of MGF's 353.3 million shares outstanding for 7.4
cents a share, then sold its stock to a new company related
to Kaiser-Francis for about 7.4 cents a share.
   Southmark, a real estate and financial services concern
that is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection
from creditors, said its proceeds from the sale were
approximately $23.5 million in cash and a long-term
nonrecourse note with a balance of about $1.2 million.
