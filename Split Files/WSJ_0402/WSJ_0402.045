   WASHINGTON -- For six months, George Bush has collected
victories in the Cold War without having to do much to earn
them. Communist regimes were toppled across Eastern Europe
without much help from the U.S.
   But now that Lithuania is seeking to carry the East bloc
self-determination movement inside the borders of the Soviet
Union, the president's job isn't so easy any more. Mr. Bush
has to struggle to sustain his two major foreign-policy
themes: support for the democratic surge in territories ruled
by Moscow, and cheerleading for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, whose recent decrees appear aimed at preventing
the uprising from penetrating his borders.

   When Mr. Bush meets Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze at the White House in a few days, he has to find
a way to reconcile those two roles without appearing to sell
out little Lithuania.
   Last week, when a reporter tried to force the president's
hand by asking him how the U.S. would respond to a crackdown,
Mr. Bush reacted sharply. "Too hypothetical; stop right
there," the president barked. "I am not going to make an
answer to a hypothetical question of that nature. What
possible good could come from the president of the United
States, standing halfway around the world, speculating on
something that he doesn't want to see happen? I mean, I could
inadvertently cause something bad to happen."
   Eager to preserve warm relations with Mr. Gorbachev, the
U.S. administration has declined to recognize Lithuania's
declaration of independence, despite urgent requests from
Vilnius and a 40-year U.S. policy of refusing to recognize
the Soviet annexation of Lithuania and the other Baltic
republics. After a few days last week of expressing concern
about Soviet intimidation, the U.S. toned down its public
comments for fear of provoking trouble.
   And, even in private communications between Secretary of
State James Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze -- a face-to-face
meeting in Africa and a cable last week -- the U.S. has taken
great care to avoid spelling out what a crackdown in
Lithuania would cost Mr. Gorbachev in terms of relations with
the U.S.
   The president's own letter to Mr. Gorbachev late last week
appears to have been similarly careful. "The president's
message to President Gorbachev simply reaffirmed our position
as stated many times," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said. He added that it "clearly stated {the president's}
support and the American support for the aspirations of the
Lithuanian people for self-determination" -- a statement that
clearly isn't the same as backing the immediate independence
the Lithuanians have declared.
   Mr. Bush himself said the letter was sent because "I want
to be sure that the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we are not trying to make things difficult
for Lithuania or for the Soviet Union or anybody else."
   There are three major reasons for this caution. First,
administration officials are convinced Mr. Gorbachev will let
Lithuania go peacefully, so long as it can be done gradually,
on Moscow's terms. Second, they argue privately that the
politically inexperienced Lithuanian leaders erred by quickly
declaring independence, rather than entering talks with
Moscow under Soviet law.
   The president himself said recently: "There are certain
realities in life, the Lithuanians are well aware of them,
and they should talk, as they are, with the Soviet
officials."
   Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker
privately admire Mikhail Gorbachev and are convinced they are
within a few months of concluding important business with him
-- a vast scaling down of Soviet military power, an agreement
to unite Germany on Western terms, and an opportunity to open
the U.S.S.R. to market-based investment.
   "We are so close to so much," says one very senior
official. "That's why we want to try to get this Lithuania
thing behind us."
   This is by far the touchiest moment for foreign policy in
the Bush presidency. If the conflict in Lithuania settles
down into negotiations without an armed crackdown, the
Bush-Baker approach will look brilliant. If not, the
president will be accused of selling out a small, budding
democracy to further big-power goals.
