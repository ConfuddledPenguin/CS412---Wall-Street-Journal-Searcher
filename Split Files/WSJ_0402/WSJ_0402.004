   NEW YORK -- VLSI Technology Inc.'s first-quarter earnings
should meet analysts' expectations, the company's chairman
and chief executive officer, Alfred J. Stein, said.
   "We expect to do as well as the analysts are projecting .
. . between five and eight cents a share," Mr. Stein added.
VLSI makes standard and customized integrated circuits.

   Mr. Stein noted that late last year, the company guided
analysts' first-quarter projections lower from earlier
estimates of around 15 cents a share.
   He said a slowdown in standard chip-set sales and a drop
in demand for custom chips by its largest customer, Apple
Computer Corp., stalled revenue growth in the quarter.
   The company had a loss of $6.3 million in the first
quarter of 1989, largely due to problems during the start-up
of its chip plant in San Antonio, Texas. VLSI earned 11 cents
a share in the latest fourth quarter.
   The company expects to release its first-quarter earnings
April 12.
   Mr. Stein said seasonal slowdown in Far Eastern demand for
the chip sets was partly responsible for damping growth in
the first quarter.
   The region's IBM-compatible computer makers use the sets
in personal computers that see their strongest sales before
the Christmas holidays. Far Eastern demand generally slacks
off in the first quarter, Mr. Stein said. Shipments to the
Far East account for about half of the company's chip-set
sales.
   Mr. Stein said demand for customized chips by Apple
Computer has recovered from a drop that also depressed
first-quarter revenue.
   "Apple is coming back very strongly to us," Mr. Stein
asserted. He added, however, that the impact of Apple's
resumed demand won't be felt until the second and third
quarters of this year.
   Apple accounted for 13% of VLSI's revenue in 1989, while
sales to International Business Machines Corp. rose to about
10% of total revenue.
   Mr. Stein said sales to IBM will exceed sales to Apple
this year because of increasing shipments to IBM, not because
of shrinking sales to Apple. The increasing importance of IBM
as a customer illustrates VLSI's strategic shift toward sales
of "application-specific standard product," primarily
standardized chip sets for personal computers, over the
customized chips designed for Apple Computer and others.
