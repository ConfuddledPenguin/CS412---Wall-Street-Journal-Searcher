   A court-appointed arbitrator has devised an innovative
plan that may resolve as many as 9,000 asbestos claims in
Maryland's courts -- and could serve as a model for future
settlements elsewhere.
   The plan, which has been tentatively approved by two dozen
of the defendants in the cases and a plaintiff's lawyer for
all the claims, would settle the suits with each of the
defendants making a "blind contribution" to an overall
settlement fund.

   This means that none of the defendant companies -- which
include GAF Corp., Armstrong World Industries Inc. and Keene
Corp.would know what any of the others has contributed, or
the total amount.
   The proposal aims to solve a thorny problem in such cases:
Since many companies manufactured the product, it is
impossible to tell which company's product caused which
injuries. Thus, manufacturers and distributors typically
disagree bitterly over how much of the total liability each
is responsible for.
   By keeping the contributions secret, the idea is to
prevent the defendants from backing out after comparing the
size of their contributions against their estimates of their
own liability. Securities laws allow publicly held companies
to disclose aggregate numbers only for all legal costs to
preserve the confidentiality of individual settlements.
   "I am increasingly optimistic that what we have here in
Maryland is going to be a model nationwide," said Kenneth R.
Feinberg, a Washington lawyer who was appointed special
master in the cases in October. Mr. Feinberg, a partner at
Kaye, Scholar, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, was assigned to
construct an out-of-court system to compensate victims of
exposure to asbestos, a widely used fire-resistant fiber that
can cause various lung diseases, including cancer.
   Keeping the individual contributions and the aggregate
fund "blind," said Mr. Feinberg, is the glue holding the
package together: "That's the only way you can get these
parties to cooperate."
   Other states -- including New York, California, Florida
and Texas -- have been looking to Maryland for a potential
solution to backlogs of asbestos litigation. Because federal
courts and most state courts don't permit asbestos injury
suits to proceed as so-called class actions, tens of
thousands of cases nationwide must proceed individually or in
small groups, eating up already burdened court time and
resources.
   The plan, which hasn't been approved by all of the 85
defendants facing asbestos claims in Maryland, offers several
advantages for plaintiffs and defendants, said Edward Houff,
an asbestos defense lawyer in Baltimore who represents 22
defendants. It provides predictability and consistency in the
settlement amounts while avoiding delay and risk of jury
trials.
   Mr. Feinberg, who helped engineer settlements for mass
claims in litigation over the Agent Orange defoliant and the
Dalkon Shield birth-control device, said he will recommend
settlement amounts for specific illnesses from exposure to
asbestos, but that the final decision will be up to Baltimore
City Circuit Judge Marshall A. Levin, who appointed Mr.
Feinberg.
   If the plan proceeds, each defendant company will make a
contribution to Peter Angelos, the Baltimore plaintiff's
lawyer who is handling 90% of the claims. Mr. Angelos, in
turn, will administer the fund and make payments to his
clients. All clients, said Mr. Angelos, have the option of
pursuing their suits in court rather than claiming a share of
the fund.
   Mr. Feinberg said a final agreement for the plan, which
would compensate all asbestos claims filed up to Sept. 1,
1990, requires the defendants to pay the amounts they have
agreed to and the plaintiffs to accept the settlement
amounts. For future claims, an effort would be made to change
Maryland court rules to require new asbestos claimants to try
arbitration before litigating their claims. The latter point
could prove difficult.
   Said Mr. Angelos: "We will not agree to anything that
erects a barricade between a plaintiff and a courthouse."

   GAF SENTENCE includes prison time for Vice Chairman James
T. Sherwin.
   A federal judge in New York sentenced Mr. Sherwin to six
months in prison and fined the company $2 million for
convictions of criminal stock manipulation and securities
fraud.
   On Friday U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, who
presided over the GAF trial last year, said it was her duty
to sentence the GAF executive to a prison term "as a lesson
to others who may be tempted to violate the laws that deal
with the {financial} markets." The judge also sentenced Mr.
Sherwin to one year of probation following his time behind
bars.
   Stephen E. Kaufman, one of Mr. Sherwin's lawyers, urged
the judge to sentence his client to community service
because, "This was an aberrational act, an isolated act, an
act totally out of character with anything he's done in his
life." The government didn't recommend a specific jail term
for Mr. Sherwin but said a "substantial sentence" was
warranted. Lawyers for Mr. Sherwin and GAF said they will
appeal the sentences.
   In the case, the government charged that Mr. Sherwin asked
the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies &amp; Co. to purchase
shares of Union Carbide Corp. in October 1986 at a certain
price. The request, prosecutors claimed, was part of a scheme
to push up the stock price just as GAF was preparing to sell
off millions of Carbide shares. Last December jurors returned
a verdict of guilty on all counts against Mr. Sherwin and
GAF.
   After the sentencing, Mr. Sherwin, a 56-year-old lawyer
who was once the nation's third ranking chess player,
declined to comment. Looking somber, he embraced his tearful
wife and five of his children. He will remain free, pending
the appeal of the sentence.
   The sentencing of Mr. Sherwin and GAF effectively marks
the end of the cases brought to the government's door by
former brokerage chief Boyd L. Jefferies. Mr. Jefferies, who
was implicated by former arbitrageur Ivan F. Boesky, in turn
pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin and GAF, as well as
corporate takeover specialist Paul A. Bilzerian and former
stock speculator Salim B. Lewis.
   Early in the summer, the government won a criminal
securities conviction against Mr. Bilzerian, who was later
sentenced to four years in prison. In August, Mr. Lewis
pleaded guilty to three felony counts and was sentenced to
three years' probation and $250,000 in fines.
   Last month, GAF agreed to settle a related civil suit
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the
settlement, the firm will pay the government $1,250,000 as
well as interest in excess of $400,000.

   LISA JONES'S CONVICTION is upheld, but appeals court
orders new sentencing.
   Ms. Jones, 27, was convicted last year of five counts of
perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to
a federal grand jury in Manhattan, N.Y. The grand jury was
looking into allegations of illegal trades between Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. and Princeton/Newport Limited
Partnership. Ms. Jones, a former assistant trader at Drexel,
denied in her testimony that she knew about the transactions.
   The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Ms.
Jones's claims that her convictions should be overturned
because of alleged conflicts of interest by her trial lawyer,
who also represented other Drexel employees. But the appeals
panel said the trial judge, Leonard Sand, improperly
increased Ms. Jones's sentence under federal sentencing
guidelines.
   At the prosecutors' request, Judge Sand boosted Ms. Jones
to a higher penalty level under the guidelines because her
perjury allegedly caused the government to spend more money
than it otherwise would have in its investigation of
Princeton/ Newport. As a result, Ms. Jones faced a sentence
of 18 to 24 months, instead of 10 to 16 months. The appeals
court said the judge should have stuck to the lower
sentencing level, and it sent the case back to Judge Sand for
resentencing. No date has been set for the new sentencing.
   "Apparently it was the view of the district court that
these instances of perjury resulted in substantial
expenditures of governmental resources," the appeals court
wrote. "No such expenditures have been demonstrated." The
court said Ms. Jones's perjury didn't deprive the government
of any information it didn't already have from other sources.
   Daniel Bookin, an attorney for Ms. Jones, declined to
comment. He said no decision has been made on whether to
appeal the conviction further.
   At the resentencing, the government could again ask for
the tougher sentence if it presented evidence that the
perjury resulted in substantial additional costs. A
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said, "It's
inappropriate at this time to discuss what the government
will do at the time of sentencing."

   FORMER DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CHIEF didn't have
conflict of interest in Eastern Airlines case, court rules.
   A federal appeals court rejected a pilots union claim that
James H. Burnley, former DOT secretary, violated conflict of
interest laws in Eastern's labor-management struggle.
   A three-member panel of the federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C., declined to review Mr. Burnley's December
1988 decision against conducting a broad-based investigation
of Eastern's operations. The Air Line Pilots Association
charged that Mr. Burnley ruled against the inquiry, which
would have been Eastern's second that year, as he was being
courted by a law firm that represents the carrier on other
matters.
   Mr. Burnley left his post as DOT secretary to become a
partner at the Washington law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp;
Trowbridge in January 1989. Although Mr. Burnley was
negotiating for the partnership while deciding the Eastern
matter, a department ethics official said Mr. Burnley could
rule on the matter because Shaw Pittman wasn't representing
Eastern during that proceeding. A second review by Mr.
Burnley's successor as transportation secretary, Samuel
Skinner, also concluded Mr. Burnley had violated no laws or
regulations.
   A spokesman for the pilots' association said he wasn't
sure if the union would seek a further appeal. Mr. Burnley
couldn't be reached.

   ATTORNEY-CLIENT SECRECY is protected in fees case.
   A federal appellate court panel upheld a ruling in favor
of a Chicago lawyer who fought a grand-jury subpoena
requesting the source of his fees, on the basis that such
information represents privileged attorney-client
communications.
   U.S. District Judge Joel M. Flaum, writing the opinion for
the Seventh U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, emphasized that
the decision isn't meant to broaden the attorney-client
privilege. But when communications are confidential, the
privilege is essential "to the proper functioning of our
adversary system," Judge Flaum said.
   The case involved David Cherney, who was subpoenaed to
testify before a federal grand jury and identify the person
who paid him the legal fees of another individual, who had
been named in a federal drug-conspiracy indictment. The
unidentified third-party fee payer also consulted Mr. Cherney
involving the fee payer's own possible involvement in the
conspiracy.
   "It is quite obvious that the government wants to learn
the identity of the feepayer so that it can bring a suspected
drug felon to justice," Judge Flaum said. "Nevertheless, the
government's interests in this instance must give way to
those served by the attorney-client privilege."
   Last week's unanimous ruling by the three-member appeals
court panel drew praise from the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers, which has battled what it views as
attempts by the government to erode that privilege.
