   HAL Inc., citing a significant decrease in passenger

   Extended periods of aircraft downtime during the fourth
quarter racked up higher losses than in the first three
quarters of 1989, HAL said. Inter-island passenger traffic
fell significantly during the fourth quarter because of
reduced capacity, the company added.
   Operating expenses for the year rose to $392.5 million in
1989 from $358.1 million in 1988, the company said.
