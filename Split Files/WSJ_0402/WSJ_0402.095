   SEOUL -- South Korea's current-account deficit widened to
$329 million in February, the second consecutive monthly
setback, because of a slowdown in exports, central bank
officials said.
   Tallies by the Bank of Korea listed the two-month deficit
as $646 million, compared with a surplus of $888 million in
the year-earlier period.

   Bank officials said the deficit in February alone was the
largest since February 1986, when an economic boom began.
