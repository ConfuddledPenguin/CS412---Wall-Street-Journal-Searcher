   Domtar Inc. said it sold all Canadian and some U.S. assets
of its Sifto Salt division to North American Salt Co.,
Mission, Kan. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The sale largely completes the disposal of Domtar's
chemical and energy interests, which the Montreal forest and
building-products concern began last year. A small specialty
chemicals concern, Clough Chemicals Inc., remains to be sold.
