   Digital Equipment Corp. plans to announce some new
engineering workstations tomorrow, but they won't surpass the
raw speed of the RS-6000 workstations unveiled by
International Business Machines Corp. in February.
   Digital is touting features of its new workstations other
than speed. Donald Gaubatz, group manager for workstations,
said that DEC's new products will have better graphics than
IBM and will fit on a desktop, unlike most rival workstations
that sit in consoles beside the desk.

   Nevertheless, "This announcement is less than one might
want," said Peter Kastner, an analyst with Aberdeen Group,
Boston.
   The workstation market has been a game of corporate
leapfrog in recent years as Digital, Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Hewlett-Packard Co. surpassed each other in producing the
latest "hot box." Digital's expected failure to top IBM shows
what a dramatic speed improvement IBM achieved when it
re-entered the market. The scientists, engineers and
programmers who use workstations demand fast machines to run
complex software and display detailed graphics.
   Digital has had a hard time in the market for fast
workstations that use reduced-instruction-set-computing, or
RISC, architecture and the UNIX operating system. Most of
Digital's workstation sales are VAXstations that run its
proprietary operating system.
   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that Digital's new
workstations will be based on Mips Computer Systems Inc.'s
R-3000 microprocessor. He said that Digital engineers have
coaxed performance of 24 million instructions per second, or
MIPS, an industry measure of performance. That far outspeeds
Digital's Decstation 2100 workstation, which processes 14
MIPS. But it falls short of IBM's new Powerstation 320, which
runs at 27 MIPS, and its more expensive Powerstation 530,
which runs at 34.5 MIPS.
   Analysts generally expect Digital to price its newest
model at less than $20,000, depending on features. Mr.
Gaubatz said the workstation will be competitively priced.
   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said that
he thinks Digital's new workstation will run faster than
IBM's workstations in commercial applications, although it
will be slower for many scientific jobs involving heavy
computation.
   Digital entered the RISC-workstation market early last
year, breaking with tradition by buying a microprocessor
design from another company, Mips Computer, rather than
building its own design. Digital's goal was to get into the
market fast. However, analysts say that its entries, the
DECstation family, have gotten off to a slow start. Terry
Shannon, who follows Digital for International Data Corp.,
Framingham, Mass., estimates that Digital sold only about
6,000 of the DECstations last year compared with about 60,000
VAXstations.
   Domenic J. LaCava, Digital's vice president in charge of
workstations, noted that the DECstation sales are "all
incremental business," that otherwise would have gone to UNIX
competitors such as Sun Microsystems. But Digital's version
of UNIX is sufficiently different from others that many UNIX
programs have yet to be translated, or "ported" in industry
jargon, to the DECstations. Digital is pushing developers to
port their software.
   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that, "the first year was a
signal that Digital was serious about the UNIX market. The
features in the new product make up for all the shortfalls of
the current model."
