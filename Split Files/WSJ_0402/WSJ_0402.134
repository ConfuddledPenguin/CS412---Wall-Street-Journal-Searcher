   NEW YORK -- The bond market was an awful place to be in
the first quarter, although junk bonds finally began showing
a glimmer of strength.
   Across the board, bond investors found their fixed-income
portfolios clobbered by rising interest rates.

   In the four major bond-market categories -- long-term
Treasurys, mortgages, municipals and corporates -- not one
produced a positive return, according to data from Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets.
   Investors who bought long-term Treasury bonds at the start
of the year had posted a miserable total return of negative
4.02% by the end of the first quarter. Total return measures
price changes and interest income. That dead performance
reflects a sharp rise in interest rates. The yield on 30-year
Treasury bonds, for example, rose to 8.62% last week from
7.99% at the end of December.
   Last year, when interest rates were falling, long-term
Treasury bonds were the best performing sector of the bond
market, which goes to show how volatile the bond market has
become lately.
   The first-quarter bond market report held some encouraging
news for the long-suffering junk market. Although junk bonds
produced a negative 2.11% total return in the quarter, they
put in a respectable performance in March.
   First Boston Corp., which tracks the performance of 343
junk bonds, said that total return of junk bonds rose nearly
3% in March following two sharp declines in January and
February.
   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. fueled the advance amid
intensifying rumors that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. would
buy back as much as $2 billion of the company's reset
pay-in-kind debentures. On Friday, some RJR bonds advanced as
much as 2 1/8 points -- about $21.25 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount -- as a Business Week article said RJR was
leaning toward a buy-back. People close to KKR disputed the
report, saying no such decision has been made.
   RJR's junk bonds aren't the only gainers these days. First
Boston said that three junk bonds advanced last month for
each junk bond that declined. The advance-decline ratio
"shows that the rebound is broad based," said Robert Long, a
First Boston managing director.
   Mr. Long said junk bonds are being supported in part by
corporate buy-backs. "Some companies have been buying $10
million to $20 million of their bonds back. That's been
putting more cash in the hands of (junk bond) portfolio
managers, and we're starting to see that cash go to work,"
said Mr. Long. "Our trading desk is running 2% to 3% higher
volume."
   Still, most investors would have been better off by
avoiding bonds altogether and putting their money into cash
and cash equivalents such as short-term Treasury bills.
Merrill Lynch said that three-month Treasury bills produced a
total first-quarter return of 1.96% while six-month bills
produced a 1.89% return. Cash levels help to protect
portfolios during down markets.
   Despite the first quarter's dismal performance, some money
managers remain optimistic about the remainder of the year.
   "Our view is that this is a correction in a bull market"
for bonds, said Roger Early, a portfolio manager at Federated
Investors Corp. Mr. Early says that the economy is growing
very slowly, corporate profits have been poor and corporate
borrowing is dwindling. Such indicators, he said, typically
indicate that interest rates will be heading lower, a trend
that boosts prices for existing bonds.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds were pummeled after the release of a
stronger-than-expected March survey of purchasing agents in
the Chicago area.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond end 3/8 point lower,
or about $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The issue's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,
rose to 8.62% from 8.58%.
   The bond market started the session on solid ground after
prices got a modest boost from buying in Europe. But the
market quickly switched directions, with 30-year bond prices
falling a full point immediately after news that the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago had seen its
index of area business activity rise to 55.1% on an
unadjusted basis in March from an unrevised 51.0% in
February.
   The increase in the Chicago index was greater than had
been expected. It raised concerns that the March survey of
purchasing agents nationwide, due out today, would show a
similar acceleration in business activity.
   In the corporate market, the high-yield junk bonds of RJR
Nabisco continued to surge. The bonds were up all week on
rumors that KKR would buy back a portion of the reset notes.
Officials at RJR have consistently declined to comment on the
rumors.
   RJR's 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures maturing
in 2009 gained 2 1/8 to finish at 74 3/4 in moderate volume
on the New York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR
issue, the 13.71% pay-in-kind exchangeable debentures due in
2007, advanced 1 3/8 points to end at 67 1/8. Pay-in-kind
debt pays interest in the form of additional securities.
   Most other junk bonds, which are speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or none at all, fell
between 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
   Municipal bonds ended mostly unchanged, with some issues
down 1/8 to 1/4 point.
