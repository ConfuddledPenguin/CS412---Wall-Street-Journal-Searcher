   OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Raiders agreed to move
back to Oakland with a less lucrative revenue guarantee than
in an earlier accord.
   Last month, Raiders' owner Al Davis tentatively agreed to
the team's return to its previous home in exchange for the
city's guaranteeing $602 million in ticket revenue over 15
years.

   The deal brought a public outcry because it essentially
obligated the city to ensure that every game be sold out. In
the new deal, the amount of guaranteed revenue was reduced to
$428 million.
