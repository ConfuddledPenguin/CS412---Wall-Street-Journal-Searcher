   WASHINGTON -- Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, the ranking GOP
member of the House Budget Committee, said he won't run for
re-election.
   "Every member of Congress knows when the time has come not
to run again," said Mr. Frenzel, who is 61 years old, at a
St. Paul, Minn., news conference. "For me, it is now."

   Rep. Frenzel, known for his quick wit and curmudgeonly
demeanor, has long fought for lower federal spending and
resisted raising taxes to reduce the budget deficit. A senior
member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Frenzel
also is a leading GOP voice on trade issues. He is currently
serving his 10th House term.
   The ranking GOP member on the budget committee is selected
by a vote of all House Republicans. Ohio Rep. Willis Gradison
is a leading contender to replace Mr. Frenzel.
