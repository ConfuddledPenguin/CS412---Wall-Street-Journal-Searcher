   NEW YORK -- You remember Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. In
1986, the investment firm borrowed $4.6 billion to finance
the takeover of Safeway. Soon, perhaps this week, KKR will
take Safeway public with an offering of 10 million shares, or
about 10% of the common.
   It is a sign of the times that Henry Kravis may find it
harder to sell $145 million of stock in today's market than
it once was for him to borrow billions. Oakland, Calif.-based
Safeway was taken private during the salad days of leveraged
buy-outs. But KKR, as well as Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, the underwriters, are well aware that times have
changed.

   Over the summer, Safeway envisioned a much bigger
offering, priced at perhaps $20 a share. That was last year.
The underwriters now predict a price of $13 to $16.
   But even at the midpoint of $14.50, Safeway could be a
tough sell. Its interest bill is about $400 million a year,
through thick times and thin. In addition, it plans to plow
$2.5 billion of cash into much-needed capital spending over
the next five years. The interest and capital outlays
together will soak up slightly more cash than Safeway expects
to generate from operations. Its debt is $3.1 billion, and
unless KKR can persuade the public to buy more stock at some
future point, its debt at the end of five years won't be a
penny less.
   "Wall Street doesn't like debt, and this company is going
to have a lot of it for quite some time," Mark Mandel of
Continental Asset Management says.
   Mr. Mandel's lack of enthusiasm has nothing to do with the
considerable progress that Safeway has made since Mr. Kravis
donned a grocer's apron. Since the buy-out by KKR, Safeway
has sold inefficient supermarkets and other operations and
remodeled or built from scratch more than 100 stores. Labor
costs have been cut, and warehouse and buying practices
computerized. Nearly half of Safeway's 1,100 outlets are
so-called superstores, the prospectus says, with 45,000 items
ranging from fresh lobster to cored pineapples. Profit
margins on specialty items, some of them prepared in what
Safeway describes as its very own "Chinese kitchens," are far
higher than margins on standard fare. Safeway's operating
profit, as a percentage of sales, climbed to 3.2% in 1989
from 2.3% in 1986. Operations are so improved, the prospectus
notes, that "operating profit for 1989 was higher on a $14
billion sales base than in 1986 on a $20 billion sales base."
   But the operating profit hasn't produced much at the
bottom line. Net income for this year is forecast at 40 cents
a share; for 1991, the estimate is 85 cents. Based on the
1990 estimate, the stock is apt to make its debut at a price
equal to about 36 times earnings.
   Safeway's strategy is to spend its way to higher profit.
It aims, every year, to remodel no fewer than 120
supermarkets and to build or rebuild 35 more. In the familiar
KKR scenario, profits will pour through an ever-widening
spigot. Sales from new stores will add 3% to total sales
annually. Higher sales from existing stores will bump total
sales growth to 8% or so a year. Safeway's operating profit
margin -- $3.20 on every $100 of sales -- will grow to $4.20
by 1994. Higher margins on higher sales will produce a 12%
annual gain in cash flow. By 1994, Safeway forecasts net
income of at least $2.25 a share.
   Wearing the cap of a junk bond salesman, KKR once told
investors that cash flow would grow enough to service
interest. Newly outfitted as a stock salesman, KKR projects
that Safeway's earnings will justify -- down the road -- the
purchase of shares today. Safeway has grown handily so far.
But investors are buying the future, not the past.
   "I have concerns," says Dana Telsey, an analyst at Baron
Asset Fund. One concern is that Safeway is telling investors
it expects to reap a 25% to 30% return on capital spending.
"Those are high numbers," she says. Another concern she cites
is "the lack of earnings."
   Safeway's underwriters, in effect, are urging investors to
ignore earnings. Concentrate instead, they say, on Safeway's
cash flow before paying interest, taxes and capital outlays.
This stance may be fine for a bondholder, but, as James
Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, notes:
"That's not what you're talking about as an owner. You're
talking about the earnings left after you put in ice-cream
freezers and pay the government."
   While Safeway is a good business, investors haven't
forgotten that bonds in certain other good businesses owned
by KKR have tanked. "There is a strong feeling that we don't
want to be KKR's patsy," says a portfolio manager at a big
mutual fund company who plans to forgo buying the issue. KKR
is aware of such sentiment. This is one reason KKR isn't
selling its own Safeway shares. But KKR's own investors are
eager to cash in, and the most likely way of doing so is by
selling shares to the public. Down the road, if the offering
succeeds, KKR will be back.
