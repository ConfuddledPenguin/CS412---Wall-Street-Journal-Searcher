   Walt Disney Co. said it would open its first "Mickey's
Kitchen" restaurant adjacent to a Disney retail store later
this month.
   A Disney spokesman confirmed a United Press International
report that the restaurant was under construction in
Montclair, Calif., saying it was a "prototype" and that no
others were being built. "We'll study it," he said, before
rolling out more.

   Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., has been operating
restaurants in its theme parks and hotels for years, but this
would be the first tied to its fast-expanding retail-store
business. The company has about 45 stores open nationwide
selling Disney paraphernalia. Currently, it is opening about
three a month, with a goal of more than 100 by 1992.
