   DALLAS -- Lomas Financial Corp. said it agreed to sell its
commercial leasing subsidiary to General Electric Co.'s
General Electric Capital Corp. for about $161 million.
   The price, which was far below the book value Lomas
assigned to the subsidiary as of June 30, 1989, or $324.2
million, underscored the erosion of Lomas's net worth since
it filed for federal bankruptcy-court protection last
September.

   But Lomas officials hailed the development, saying that it
would allow the financial-services company to shed the
leasing unit's $1 billion of debt and $30.6 million of
preferred stock. "Although in terms of the recoupment of
equity it was not as high a price as we might have hoped, our
focus has remained on the fundamental objective" of slashing
debt, Chairman Jess Hay said in an interview.
   Mr. Hay said the sale will fulfill the company's goal,
formulated last April, of cutting its then $5.8 billion debt
load by 60% to 65% and focusing its operations on its core
mortgage operations. Debt will be reduced to about $2.3
billion if the sale is completed, he added.
   The low sale price wasn't unexpected. In its second
quarter ended Dec. 31, Lomas took a $125 million charge
against earnings to cover net losses it expected to incur by
selling its leasing unit, known as Ellco Leasing Corp., and
its life-insurance segment. Lomas said Ellco's book value is
now $164 million, reflecting a write-down of the unit's
intangible assets.
   Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., Little
Rock, Ark., had previously estimated that the unit would
bring between $150 million and $200 million. "Once you enter
bankruptcy, especially if you're a financial-services
company, individual units as a general rule tend to
deteriorate," he said.
   Lomas paid about $263.3 million in cash and stock to
acquire Ellco from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
U.S. in 1987. The unit, based in San Diego, employs about 300
people and leases computer equipment and other
high-technology office gear to large corporations throughout
the U.S.
   General Electric Capital Corp., a financial services unit
of Fairfield, Conn.-based GE, couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Sale of the Lomas unit would require approval from a
federal bankruptcy court in New York. Under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company receives court protection
from creditors while it works out a plan to repay its debts.
