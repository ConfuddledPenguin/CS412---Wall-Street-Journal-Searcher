   NEW YORK -- Dillon, Read &amp; Co. lost its top money manager,
as Timothy G. Dalton Jr. left along with the securities
firm's entire U.S. money-management unit to start their own
company.
   Mr. Dalton, 51 years old, formed Dalton, Greiner, Hartman,
Maher &amp; Co. along with what he said would be about 20
co-workers from Dillon Read. The new company hopes to assume
the $3 billion in assets that Dillon, Read Capital Inc., the
unit that he headed, currently manages for 70 corporate
pension funds and other institutions.

   Mr. Dalton resigned as Dillon Read Capital's president and
as a Dillon Read director.
   Mr. Dalton's departure is one of a string of personnel
changes at Dillon Read recently. The heads of risk arbitrage
and private placements and the co-head of the corporate bond
group have left, in what Dillon Read said are unrelated
moves.
   Dillon Read, a unit of Travelers Corp., said it will help
Mr. Dalton transfer all its U.S. accounts to his new company,
but that Dillon Read's international money-management units
will remain part of Dillon Read. The company said it would
have a "significant financial interest" in the Dalton Greiner
company, but no direct equity interest or control over it.
   "Dillon Read has been a great place to have been," said
Mr. Dalton, who joined the company in 1982 when it set up
Dillon Read Capital. The unit's clients include the Illinois
Municipal Retirement Fund and the pension funds of Inland
Steel Industries Inc. and Hughes Aircraft. Mr. Dalton said,
"We're in the process of talking with everybody" about
transferring their business to the new company.
   Mr. Dalton has done well compared with other money
managers. His stock accounts rose 10% in 1987, the year of
the stock-market crash, and significantly outperformed the
market with a 20% rise in 1988. But Mr. Dalton probably
stayed bearish too long in 1989, when he managed only a 24%
gain, compared with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index's
31.7% gain with dividends reinvested.
   Smaller stocks are the place to be these days, says Mr.
Dalton, who says the market is in a "significant correction,"
rather than a bear market. But he is keeping 30% of his
accounts' assets in cash to prepare for the stock-market
declines ahead. Why small stocks? "The big ones haven't
really corrected, and the small ones {already} have," he
said.
