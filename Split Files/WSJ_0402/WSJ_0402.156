   NCR Corp. and Teradata Corp., completing terms of a
venture for jointly developing their parallel-processing
computer technologies, said NCR bought 1,400,995 newly issued
Teradata shares for $26.26 each, or $36.8 million.
   The purchase gives Dayton, Ohio-based NCR, an
information-processing systems company, a 9.4% stake in
Teradata, a Los Angeles-based computer systems concern. The
price was a 15% premium over the average closing price of
Teradata shares in the 30 days before the venture was first
announced. In national over-the-counter trading Friday,
Teradata shares closed at $31.50, down 75 cents. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, NCR shares closed at
$68.625, down $1.875.

   Under the agreement, NCR and Teradata will contribute
personnel, technology and funding to the project, with NCR
providing most of the funding initially. The two companies
will develop general business computer systems during the
three-year project.
