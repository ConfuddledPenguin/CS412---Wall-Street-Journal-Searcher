   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division will
offer rebates on certain 1990 models, and Chrysler Corp.
extended its guaranteed rebate program.
   GM is offering rebates of $1,500 on the DeVille, Fleetwood
and Brougham models, and $2,000 on Eldorado and Seville
models through May 31.

   Chrysler's rebate program, which had been scheduled to end
last Saturday, was extended through May 31 for 1990-model
cars and trucks, except minivans and LeBaron convertibles.
Chrysler guarantees that if it offers a higher rebate through
Sept. 30, it will make up the difference to a buyer who got a
lower rebate. It also increased the rebate on its 1989-model
LeBaron coupe to $2,000 from $1,000.
