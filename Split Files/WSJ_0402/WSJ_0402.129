   GLADEVILLE, Tenn. -- To most people, toxic waste like that
dumped in a shallow pit near Texas Eastern Corp.'s gas
pipeline here is the stuff of corporate nightmares. But to a
takeover artist, it can be mighty handy.
   When Coastal Corp. launched a hostile bid for Texas
Eastern last year, it loudly warned of "serious PCB
problems," in Gladeville and at locations all along the 1,500
miles of Texas Eastern's pipelines. The specter of an
estimated $400 million cleanup, Coastal figured, would spook
other potential buyers.

   For a while it did, too. "We didn't bid because of the
PCBs," concedes Richard D. Kinder, vice chairman of Enron
Corp. Another possible buyer says it backed off because it
didn't have enough time to examine the extent of
contamination, much of which occurred 30 years ago. In the
end, Coastal lost anyway to a friendly $3.22 billion offer
from Panhandle Eastern Corp. But by then even Panhandle was
wary.
   "You can bet your boots they {the PCBs} were factored into
our overall examination," says Robert Hunsucker, Panhandle's
chairman. His edgy lenders demanded an outside liability
estimate before they would finance the bid.
   Unknown or uncertain environmental liabilities are
increasingly shaping acquisitions and takeovers, from
multibillion-dollar leveraged buy-outs to the sale of tiny
strip malls. They are killing some deals outright, sharply
raising the price tags of others, and causing still others to
crash later on.
   "I'm getting a call a month asking me to talk to senior
executives on how to avoid environmental pitfalls in the
'90s. That never happened before," says George Pilko,
president of Pilko &amp; Associates Inc., an environmental
consultant.
   Buyers are fearful of hidden cleanup costs, which can
easily run to $25 million or more. Assuming the new Clean Air
bill before Congress passes, many companies will soon be
paying more to contain their own pollution. So the last thing
they want is to get saddled with additional costs from an
inherited toxic dump.
   They are realizing that this kind of liability can be
lurking virtually anywhere. In a one-mile circle of downtown
San Diego, Environmental Information Systems Inc., a
consultant on liabilities, identified more than 400
environmentally risky addresses simply by culling public
records. Included are a soap company, a police station, a
photography studio, a jeweler, a bank and a university.
"Downtown San Diego is fairly representative of large cities
in the U.S.," says Ronald Miller, the firm's president.
   Moreover, surprises abound. One recent review of old
aerial photographs -- a standard practice in an environmental
audit -- turned up a 1920s auto race track about a
quarter-mile from the famed Beverly Hills Hotel.
Multimillion-dollar houses now stand where fuel tanks, grease
and solvents from the track might once have contaminated the
ground, according to Mr. Miller's firm.
   Dodging the arm of environmental law after the fact is
increasingly difficult. A buyer can be held liable even if he
didn't own or operate the property at the time of
contamination and, needless to say, former owners can be sued
even if they unloaded the property long ago. To help
investors avoid getting blindsided, the Securities and
Exchange Commission recently told companies to be more
forthcoming about environmental liabilities, and the EPA is
handing over data on hazardous sites to help the commission
cross-check disclosures.
   "Negotiations over environmental issues take more time
than any other single point," says Gordon Cain, chairman of
the Houston-based leveraged buy-out firm Sterling Group. "All
the sellers want to get rid of as much of the liability as
they can and no buyer wants to take it."
   Mr. Cain ought to know. He took part two years ago in what
has become something of a landmark deal in the area of
environmental risk. Sterling agreed to buy a former Koppers
Co. chemical business from Beazer PLC of Britain for $660
million. Beazer pledged to pay for any existing environmental
problems, a vital issue because of possible creosote
contamination at two dozen Koppers wood-treatment sites.
Sterling estimated the worst-case liability at $600 million.
   "We would have lived with that if we had been convinced
they {Beazer} were financially able to meet their
obligation," recalls Mr. Cain. But the day before a
definitive agreement was to be signed, Sterling pulled out.
"We found that Beazer structured its financing so that the
indemnity to us came after a lot of other obligations," he
says.
   Similarly, big asbestos claims pushed Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.'s $2.4 billion leveraged buy-out of Jim Walter
Corp. into bankruptcy court. KKR had known that a Jim Walter
unit, Celotex Corp., once made asbestos products, but figured
that because Celotex was a separate subsidiary, claims could
be confined to it. Anyway, Celotex was sold three months
after the Jim Walter buy-out was completed.
   "They didn't do their homework properly," asserts attorney
Stephen D. Susman, who on behalf of 80,000 asbestos victims
is suing KKR and Hillsborough Holdings Corp., the KKR company
that took Jim Walter private. The suit estimates claims of
over $3 billion. Though KKR and Hillsborough insist the suit
is without merit, its mere filing so unsettled bond investors
and potential asset buyers that Hillsborough sought
bankruptcy court protection in December.
   On the other hand, knowledge of environmental hazards can
give one party an edge in negotiations. "We see investment
opportunities where the perceived risk may be greater than
the actual risk," says Mark Whiting, chief operating officer
of the Shidler Group, a San Francisco-based real estate
company. When Shidler found asbestos in a Los Angeles office
building it had offered to buy for $6 million, it cut the bid
by $1 million. The worried seller, a financial institution,
grabbed it. Shidler had privately estimated the cost of
removal at only $500,000.
   Often Mr. Whiting carves a high-risk property out of a
deal. Not long ago, after Shidler offered $34 million for 11
industrial sites, an environmental consultant reported danger
signs at one Danvers, Mass., plant where chlorinated solvents
had been used. The consultant found groundwater contamination
extending beyond the site. "We kicked the property out of the
deal," Mr. Whiting says. "We dodged a bullet."
   As a result of the new risks, more and more bankers are
requiring so-called environmental audits before financing
acquisitions. Some predict such studies will become as
routine in takeovers as termite inspections in house sales.
What is different is that environmental liabilities can't
always be quantified. Sometimes they can't even be found.
"The problem is that you're guessing," says Susan Lintott, a
managing director of Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.
   A suit against State Street Bank of Boston related to a
New England waste site particularly worries bankers who fear
it could set a precedent. Plaintiffs argue the bank is liable
because it in effect became a co-operator of the site while
attempting to recover a loan from the site's owner. The
actual operator had filed for bankruptcy protection in 1977.
State Street doesn't even own the unit that made the loans
anymore; that was sold in 1983.
   The notion that a lender may be held liable if it had
anything to do with a contaminated property even has some
banks avoiding foreclosure on overdue debts.
   Robert G. Wallace and Jack B. Hensley bought the 3.5-acre
Jenson Drive Scrap Yard in Houston a few years ago from
Charter National Bank for $250,000, financing the deal
through Charter. Six months later, after they couldn't make a
go of the business, they tried to sell it, but a prospective
buyer's environmental audit revealed widespread PCB
contamination. The Environmental Protection Agency condemned
the lot and said contact with the soil could be dangerous.
The place needed a $10 million cleanup.
   The men stopped payment on their loan and sued, alleging
the bank had known the site was polluted and never told them.
"The bank never took any steps to try to recover the note,"
says John Millard, the owners' attorney. "It's kind of a hot
potato." A lawyer for the bank won't discuss the case except
to deny the claims against the bank.
   Many companies carrying environmental liabilities know
they have them. Texas Eastern, for example, routinely and
openly dumped PCB-laden lubricants into a pit at its pipeline
compressor station here. "That was just the way of doing
things," recalls Dallas Plumlee, a 20-year veteran employee
of the company.
   Pipeline companies first added polychlorinated biphenyls,
or PCBs, to lubricating oils as a safety measure to prevent
flash fires in extremely hot compressors. Unfortunately, the
exceptional stability that makes PCBs a fire retardant also
means they don't break down in the environment. At Texas
Eastern, PCBs leaked through motor seals and down the
pipeline, ultimately contaminating at least 49 sites. By the
1970s, the potentially adverse health effects of exposure to
PCBs had become an issue. The EPA banned their manufacture in
1979.
   Today, there is little visible evidence of any huge
liability here amid the pastoral, rolling hills about 20
miles from Nashville. The former murky oil-dumping pit is now
capped by a grassy knoll, and the company has installed a
series of cylindrical storage vats, at $700,000 a set, to
catch new waste from the compressor operation.
   But the oil -- and the PCBs -- must still be removed from
the old pit. To that end, Texas Eastern plans to drill half a
dozen ground-water monitoring wells at $20,000 each to help
determine the extent of the contamination; it expects many
more wells will be needed to fully map the location of the
PCBs.
   Then there's the matter of removing the contaminated soil.
Special trucks will be needed to cart it to the nearest
hazardous-waste dump, more than 100 miles away. That can cost
$500 per cubic yard, and the Gladeville pit may contain 500
cubic yards of soil by one estimate.
   No wonder, then, that the broader, systemwide cleanup will
take time, money -- and more money. Already, Texas Eastern
has 29 people working on the project full-time, and 200
mapping wells have been dug at contaminated sites along its
pipeline. The company still estimates that it will take $400
million to clean up all the PCBs. And the job won't be
completed anytime soon: Texas Eastern says it will be 10
years before all the contaminated soil is located and carted
away.
