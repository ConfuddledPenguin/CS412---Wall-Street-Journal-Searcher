   Gillette Co. said it agreed to sell its European skin care
and hair care businesses to Nobel Consumer AB, a division of
Nobel Industries of Sweden, for $107 million. Gillette also
will retain some $30 million in receivables.
   Gillette said in Boston that it expects the sale to be
completed within 60 days.

   The European brands being sold to Nobel include Silkience
hair care products, Antica Erboristeria herbal toiletries in
Italy and La Toja toiletry products in Spain.
   Gillette isn't selling its European deodorant,
anti-perspirant and shaving preparations lines, which it will
continue to make and market.
   Gillette had said last December that it planned to sell
certain European toiletries businesses as part of a
realignment of its North Atlantic shaving and personal care
products into one operating unit.
