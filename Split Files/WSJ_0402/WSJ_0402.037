   TOKYO -- Continuing a sustained trend, Japan's steel
exports in February declined 20% from a year earlier to 1.359
million metric tons, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation
said.
   In November 1988, steel exports showed a year-to-year gain
for the first time since August 1986, but they have fallen
steadily again since then. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.

   The latest data followed drops of 22% in January and 24%
in December.
   Federation officials reiterated that Japanese steelmakers
have been preoccupied with efforts to meet strong domestic
demand that has been fueling sustained economic expansion.
Recent surveys have shown that demand for steel from major
domestic users such as auto makers, shipbuilders and
construction companies remains strong.
   "Demand in overseas markets . . . appears to be
diminishing," an official said. "Other countries are also
trying to diversify their sources of supply."
   Reversing a long string of declines, exports to the U.S.
rose 16% from a year earlier to 260,000 metric tons.
Officials said shipments of seamless pipe, often used for oil
drilling because of its strong resistance against pressure
and corrosion, were especially strong. These more than
doubled from the year-earlier levels. This may be an
indication, the officials said, that oil drilling has been
accelerating in the U.S.
   The officials also pointed out, though, that exports in
the year-earlier month, at about 225,000 metric tons, were
particularly small as a result of brisk demand in the
domestic market. This comparison made the pace of growth in
February 1990 look good, they said. In January 1989, for
example, steel exports to the U.S. were more than twice as
large as in February 1989, or about 560,000 tons.
   Steel exports to communist countries continued a
persistent, sharp fall. Shipments to the Soviet Union plunged
52% to 47,000 metric tons, while those to China tumbled 62%
to 134,000 tons. Officials said that China and the Soviet
Union have been hurt by foreign currency shortages, and that
this apparently is responsible for the relentless downturn.
Economic conditions in the two countries haven't generated
strong demand for steel, either, they said.
   Exports to South Korea and Taiwain also slumped, off 44%
to 89,000 metric tons and 34% to 114,000 tons, respectively.
