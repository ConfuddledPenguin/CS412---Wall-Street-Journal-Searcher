   Recycling is hot. But since most municipal curbside
programs pick up only aluminum cans, newspapers and glass,
many experts have questioned whether recycling will ever
fulfill environmentalists' dream of solving America's
solid-waste crisis.
   But a new program kicking off this morning in the
Ken-Caryl Ranch section of Littleton, Colo., suggests that
recycling's potential may be far greater than generally
thought.

   The Ken-Caryl program will pick up approximately 35
different items found in, around, even on the house, with
more to be added after the program gets rolling. Included is
almost anything aluminum, such as foil, pie plates, TV dinner
trays, pots and pans, lawn chairs, storm doors, window frames
-- even siding, rain gutters and car radiators.
   "This program's unique," says Resource Recycling magazine
editor-in-chief Jerry Powell. "If it works, it will be copied
everywhere," predicts Gregory Lawler, aide to Gov. James
Florio of New Jersey, a state up to its eyeballs in garbage.
   The Littleton program also will pick up every shape and
color of glass, plus a large number of paper products,
including corrugated cardboard, grocery bags, writing and
computer paper, even the kids' colored notebook paper, along
with newspapers. Plastic, too, is on the menu, specifically
plastic grocery bags, soda bottles and milk jugs.
   Then there are, for the lack of a better description,
specialty items, such as brass faucets, stainless steel sinks
and counter tops, copper wire and tubing, plus lawnmower
casings.
   "I'm cleaning out my house," says Ken-Caryl resident Cathy
Johnson, who pushed for the comprehensive recycling program
along with several other residents. "I'm throwing out huge
balls of aluminum foil and even my old lawn chairs," she
says.
   The Ken-Caryl program has other advantages over most of
the U.S.'s 5,000 or so existing curbside recycling programs.
One is that homeowners won't be asked to sort their
recyclables -- a task that has been a real turn-off for some
-- but rather will only have to put everything into a giant,
14-gallon bin. (The big items can be put out separately.)
Pick-up will be once a week by Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc., a
unit of Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. of Canada., which will
have a compactor truck follow its regular garbage truck
through the 2,700-home community.
   Another advantage is cost. According to Tri-R Systems
Corp., a Denver-based recycling firm that will sort and sell
the recycled 35 items picked up by Laidlaw, the typical
curbside recycling program currently costs about $2.50 per
household per month. Of that amount, about 15 cents flows
back to the community from the revenue generated by the sale
of the recycled goods.
   By contrast, the Ken-Caryl program will generate about 25
cents to 40 cents per household back to the community,
according to Tri-R chairman and president David Powelson.
Moreover, the additional revenue will come from more reliable
metals markets, offsetting the wide price swings for
newspaper and glass that have recently hurt many municipal
programs.
   Mr. Powelson says that among the other items scheduled to
be added to the Ken-Caryl program are tin cans, junk mail and
polystyrene. The latter has been banned by some
municipalities, but Mr. Powelson says that since the Food and
Drug Administration recently agreed to let recycled
polystyrene be used for making egg cartons, Tri-R will soon
have a resale market for that plastic material.
   Still, there are some things most homeowners commonly
throw away that won't be picked up. Batteries and motor oil
are two of them. Mr. Powelson explains that because both are
listed as hazardous substances, picking them up "would be
like picking up asbestos."
   Another common throwaway, the telephone book, also isn't
on the list, even though telephone books have been singled
out by environmentalists for needlessly filling up scarce
landfill space. The problem, says Mr. Powelson, is that the
only market for old telephone books is a small market
overseas: Some countries use telephone-book pages to wrap
fruit.
