   It Only Looks Like Child Abuse

   Houston -- Six girls, aged 13 to 15, are leaping and
flipping their little hearts out on the blue-carpeted mat in
the shed-like building in northwest Houston, but their
overseer, a burly, mustached man, is not charmed. During a
pause, he mimics and exaggerates their errors, and shakes his
head in dismay.
   Kim Zmeskal, a tiny, pale-eyed 14-year-old, is a special
target of his wrath. "If you're not going to put up a decent
effort, you might as well go home," he tells her after she
bobbles a multiple somersault in a floor-exercise routine.
"You can't progress if your mind isn't in it."

   But later, after the girls have left, Bela Karolyi pleads
not guilty to child abuse. "These are very talented, very
motivated kids, and they are here because they want to be the
best," he says. "Sometimes they have to be pushed."
   He goes on, "If I were a piano teacher, saying the same
things to my gifted pupils, people would understand. But
sports really are no different. We are playing difficult
pieces here -- Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. We want to play
them better than anybody else."
   Since Karolyi came to Houston in 1982, a year after
gaining asylum from his native Romania during a visit to New
York, American girls in his charge have been doing just that
in the demanding sport of gymnastics. He coached Mary Lou
Retton, winner of the all-around gold medal at the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles, and Phoebe Mills, whose bronze medal
in the balance beam at Seoul in 1988 was the first by a U.S.
female in games in which the entire East Bloc competed.
   Next week in Denver his latest prodigy, young Miss
Zmeskal, will be among the favorites in the 1990 U.S.
championships. She burst into prominence last March by
capturing the McDonald's American Cup, gymnastics' shiniest
international prize, offered annually on these shores.
Karolyi pupils have won eight of the last 15 of those. His
first winner, in 1976, was his Romanian pupil, the elegant
Nadia Comaneci, perhaps the best woman gymnast ever.
   None of this has been accomplished quietly. At meets, Bela
cheers on his charges and envelops them in celebratory bear
hugs he might as well patent. Between times, he wars with the
sport's powers-that-be.
   His flight from his homeland capped a running feud between
himself and what he calls the "party guys" in the Romanian
athletic bureaucracy, and he doesn't mean fellas who ran
around wearing funny hats and throwing streamers. The last
straw, he says, was the furor he raised at the 1980 Olympics
in Moscow, after judges deliberated for a half hour before
giving Comaneci a score on the beam, her last event, that
left her .075-point short of her second all-around gold,
behind a Soviet.
   "Their {the Soviets'} cheating was so dirty and open I
couldn't keep my mouth shut, even though I knew I'd have to
answer for it at home," he says now.
   Becoming a Texan hasn't changed his outspokenness; he was
pointedly critical of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation for not
making him the 1988 U.S. Olympic women's coach after the
trials, in which his Houston school produced three of the six
team members and the one run by Californian Don Peters, who
had the job, produced none. He says he'll make the same fuss
in '92 if the circumstances are repeated.
   "If I have the best athletes, I should be coach; if
somebody else has them, he or she should. What could be
simpler?" he declares.
   He adds: "Maybe they don't like that I talk. Well, too
bad. Life's short. I'll be quiet a long time when I'm dead."
   The life that the 49-year-old Karolyi has lived to date
has been eventful by any standard. A heavyweight boxer and
track-and-field hammer thrower as a youth, he admits to
taking up gymnastics coaching "because that was what they
{the regime} were pushing, so that was where the opportunity
was." He and his wife and aide, Martha, spotted Comaneci as a
girl in Onesti, made her a champion, and himself Romanian
national team coach.
   After a defection he remembers as more exasperating than
dramatic ("two days we stood in line for our immigration
papers"), the Karolyis waited in vain for U.S. coaching
offers, a snub that still rankles. While looking for work in
California, he unloaded ships and worked in restaurants. The
couple finally got jobs in Norman, Okla., and scraped up the
wherewithal to open their Houston club.
   Mary Lou came from West Virginia for training here, and
Phoebe, et al., followed. Now, Karolyi Gymnastics enrolls
some 600 pupils and affords its proprietors a life style that
includes a cattle and quarter-horse ranch along the Trinity
River east of town. Even detractors grant Bela's pre-eminence
as a motivator, an accolade he smilingly accepts.
   "Coaching sports like track and field is dry, academic.
For gymnastics, you need to bring out some pizzazz and a
little guts," he says. "Mary Lou was the best kid for that.
She had wonderful spirit. She was like a little chicken in
the big meets; you could almost see her heart beating."
   Karolyi believes that Zmeskal, a 4-foot-5, 70-pound eighth
grader, can pick up where Mary Lou left off. He praises her
speed, coordination and showmanship, and hopes that between
now and '92 she can acquire the stamina and discipline that
Olympic medalhood requires. He notes that she and Hilary
Grivich, 13, another budding Olympian still competing as a
junior, are special to him because they've spent their entire
gymnastic lives under his tutelage. Zmeskal has been a
Karolyi Kid since age six, having been introduced to the
sport by a babysitter whose daughter attended his school.
   Like the dozen or so other elite students at Karolyi
Gymnastics, Zmeskal trains six hours a day, six days a week.
She smiles a lot off-mat, collects bottles, and says the
balance beam is her favorite event "because it used to scare
me but doesn't any more."
   She asserts that she doesn't mind the work, or Bela's
verbal prodding. "When I was younger, he'd always smile at me
and pat my head, but now I know I have to really train," she
says. "And I know that even when it seems like he's trying to
kill us, it's for our own good."
