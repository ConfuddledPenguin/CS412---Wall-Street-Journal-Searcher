   WASHINGTON -- Factory orders fell sharply in April after
two months of growth, the Commerce Department reported, a new
sign of weakness in U.S. manufacturing.
   Pushed down by a 4.3% plunge in durable-goods bookings,
orders for manufactured goods fell 2.3% in April, after
increasing 4% in March and 1.8% in February.

   The drop in durable-goods orders centered in
transportation equipment, especially motor vehicle and
aircraft. Transportation-equipment orders fell 14.7% in
April, to $31.68 billion, following a 24.1% surge in March.
   Economists said the factory-orders report is just another
indication that the manufacturing sector is fairly sluggish,
specifically in the automobile industry.
   "What this report reflects is a continuing softness in the
manufacturing sector, with a concentrated weakness in the
auto industry," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at
DRI/McGraw-Hill.
   Agreeing with Mr. Brinner, Priscilla Trumbull, industry
analyst at WEFA Group, said the "auto and aircraft sectors
are showing some bumpy patterns . . . which mean that
manufacturing is not really sliding, but it is not growing
either."
   While many economists agreed that the April figures
reflect a problem in the automobile industry, they said the
drop in aircraft bookings simply means orders were slow in
that particular month. The aircraft industry has been one of
the few strong spots in U.S. manufacturing.
   "Aircraft orders will definitely bounce back . . . within
the next month," said Mr. Brinner. "The only real problem at
this point is a problem in the automobile industry, and this
is nothing new."
   The April report said overall factory orders totaled
$235.60 billion.
   While most analysts focused on the steep decline in
durable-goods orders -- which was slightly more than an
earlier government estimate of 4.1%-nondurable-goods orders
also failed to improve. They were about unchanged in April at
$112.2 billion.
   Durable goods are products such as computers, cars and
other big-ticket items expected to last at least three years.
   Economists said they wouldn't be surprised if the
sluggishness in manufacturing led to a further increase in
unemployment.
   "Unemployment will be somewhat shaky. . . . We definitely
will see some continued layoffs, especially in the defense
industry. But I don't think we will see widespread
unemployment," said Ms. Trumbull.
   Ms. Trumbull said she expects a small increase in factory
orders throughout the rest of the year.
   Manufacturers' inventories edged up 0.1% to $372.28
billion in April, following a 0.4% drop in March and a 0.3%
decline in February.
   April shipments decreased 1.2% to $234.35 billion,
following increases of 1.2% in March and 3.4% in February.
Unfilled orders inched up 0.2% to $517.68 billion, following
a 0.7% rise in March and a 0.5% decline in February.
   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.
