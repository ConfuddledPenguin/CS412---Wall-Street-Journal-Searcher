   The dollar will hold fairly steady against most major
currencies in June, but will drift lower over the summer
against the yen and fall on a steeper trajectory against the
West German mark, according to a survey of 10 currency
analysts in four trading centers.
   At the end of June, the dollar will be trading at 150.45
yen and 1.6745 marks, according to the average forecast of 10
economists and traders in Tokyo, Frankfurt, London and New
York surveyed by Dow Jones International News Service. But by
the end of August, the dollar is expected to fall to 149.80
yen and 1.6480 marks.

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6965 marks, up from 1.6830 marks late Wednesday, and at
152.10 yen, up from 151.45 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6785, down from $1.6950 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 152.25 yen soon
after the opening, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 151.75
yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6933
marks.
   A similar survey a month ago predicted that the dollar
would finish May at 159.20 yen and 1.6980 marks. On March 1,
the survey projected the dollar would be at 148.25 yen and
1.6825 marks at the end of May.
   The analysts also are forecasting that sterling will trade
for $1.6855 after 30 days but slip to $1.6690 after 90 days.
   The 30-day forecasts for the dollar ranged from lows of
141.50 yen and 1.6280 marks and highs of 155.00 yen and
1.7100 marks. Most forecasts, however, were in a range of
148.00 yen to 154.00 yen and 1.6500 marks to 1.6900 marks.
   The 90-day forecasts range from 137.80 yen and 1.5850
marks to 157.00 yen and 1.7500 marks. Most 90-day forecasts
put the dollar between 145.00 yen and 155.00 yen and 1.62
marks and 1.67 marks.
   At the center of attention in June will be the
developments leading to the monetary and economic union of
East and West Germany, scheduled to take effect July 1.
Complications and unforeseen pitfalls along the path to
monetary union will make trading occasionally erratic and
unpredictable in June, analysts said. But most of the those
surveyed feel the mark should emerge strengthened from the
turmoil by the end of the summer.
   "The closer we get to monetary union, the greater the
chances are that we'll see some negative developments for the
mark," said Ernst Pullmann, senior trader at Deutsche
Girozentrale Kommunalebank in Frankfurt. Normally quite
bearish on the dollar, Mr. Pullmann said he sees the dollar
firming to 1.6950 marks at the end of June, but falling to
1.6400 marks at the end of August.
   "There'll definitely be a number of negative headlines
still to come in June," he added. "But after the currency
union . . . I think we'll see a clearly stronger mark."
   Dale Larson, an economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco, said he agreed that the driving force of the
markets in June will be the mark but he foresees a different
outcome. He predicted the dollar would firm to 1.7000 marks
at the end of June and to 1.7200 marks at the end of August,
due to the multitude of problems arising from the German
monetary union.
   But the ceiling for the dollar's gains will be 1.7200
marks, he said, where the West German central bank, having
grown fond of the anti-inflationary effects of a firm mark,
will probably intervene to block any further gains.
   The stronger mark has led to a sharp falloff in West
German import prices; at last count in April they were down
4.3% from a year earlier. That has damped producer prices and
in turn inflation, which has enabled the Bundesbank to relax
its finger on the interest-rate trigger.
   Shigeto Yanase, manager of foreign exchange with Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank in Tokyo, agreed that the mark will be the center
of attention over the next few months. He said he sees higher
interest rates in West Germany coming within three months,
which would contrast with steady rates in the U.S. and Japan.
Germany's central position in a unified European market will
continue to add to the mark's luster in foreign-exchange
markets, he said.
   "Germany will be the most powerful economy in that group,"
he said. "They'll have some temporary problems with inflation
and unemployment, but over the long term, Germany will be
very strong. I think we could eventually see a one-to-one
exchange rate between the mark and the dollar."
   But not all experts are bullish about the mark. Masahiro
Sasabe, manager of customer dealing at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
in Tokyo, said he expects Japanese investors' heavy buying of
European currencies against the yen to slow as the outlook on
German unification becomes more sober.
   "They're purchasing a kind of European dream. But now the
actual schedule has been set," Mr. Sasabe said. He expects
downward pressure on the yen to lighten as investors realize
that returns from economic expansion in Europe will be
gradual.
   Kevin Adams, an economist in London at Hoare Govett, a
British unit of Security Pacific National Bank, said he
expects the Bundesbank to refrain from raising its interest
rates, because of the inflationary consequences arising from
reunification with East Germany, until September or October.
As a result, he said, the dollar will likely remain stable
around 1.6700 marks over the next month to 90 days.
   Speculation over the possibility of a Japanese
interest-rate increase also is expected to continue, fueled
by comments from Japanese authorities that they are keeping a
close eye on cost pressures and money-supply growth. However,
Mr. Adams said he expects the yen to remain strong more
because of continued reassessment of Japan's economic
fundamentals rather than any rate action.
   Irwin Kellner, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust
in New York, said he believes the dollar is overvalued
against the yen and other Asian currencies, but undervalued
against the mark and other European currencies.
   Mr. Kellner cited trade imbalances and the fact that the
U.S. has recently been running a trade surplus with Europe
while the deficit with Japan remains enormous.
   This situation justifies a firmer dollar against European
currencies and a weaker dollar against the yen, Mr. Kellner
said. By the end of August, he sees the dollar easing to
148.00 yen and firming to 1.7200 marks.
   But Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
in New York, disagreed, saying he expects the dollar to firm
against the yen because he doubts the Bank of Japan will
raise interest rates. "I think the dollar has been oversold
against the yen," said Mr. Hormats.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for
current delivery settled at $364.30 an ounce, up 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $364.20 an ounce.
