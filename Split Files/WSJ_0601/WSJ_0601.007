   SMALL BUSINESS LOBBIES against proposals for a new civil
rights bill.
   Congressional sponsors of the new bill want to override
several recent Supreme Court decisions that they say weaken
the 1964 Civil Rights Act banning employment discrimination.
But small-business groups argue that the bill would, in
effect, require hiring quotas, which they say would hurt
firms with fewer workers; they focus their lobbying on
President Bush, who has said he won't sign a "quota" bill.

   They also oppose a change that would add punitive damages
for intentional discrimination. An amendment by Missouri GOP
Sen. John Danforth revising some terms "doesn't begin to
solve the problem," says Nancy Fulco, human resources
attorney for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Compared with the current law, the language of the new
bill would make it harder for an employer to prove that its
hiring process is fair, says John Galles, executive vice
president of National Small Business United. But an aide to
Sen. Danforth says the new wording simply summarizes the
essence of earlier civil rights case law. And as for damages,
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, adds: "We've said from the beginning that
this bill has two purposes: to overturn five Supreme Court
decisions and to add monetary damages for intentional
discrimination."
   The bill's backers deny that the legislation would
effectively mandate quotas and accuse opponents of trying to
delay passage.

   CLEAN AIR COMPROMISES by the House make small firms
breathe easier.
   Small business won two important amendments in the clean
air bill passed last week by the House. One amendment would
enable a small business to reduce emissions by using
reformulated chemicals or operating at different hours
instead of simply buying costly anti-pollution equipment.
Another would let companies apply for one emissions permit in
their home state, which then would automatically seek the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's approval. The original
bill required seeking separate permits from the home state,
all contiguous states and the federal government.
   The separate clean air bill passed earlier by the Senate
says the states should decide permit issues. But "if Congress
doesn't take care of this now, they'll have to come back and
fix it within a year, like kids coming back to do extra work
after school," says Christian Braunlich, director of the
National Association of Manufacturers' small manufacturers'
forum.
   Small furniture manufacturers are relieved that the House
measure also would require states to give small concerns
technical compliance information. The American Furniture
Manufacturers Association says that because of California's
air-quality rules, its industry has lost about 2,000 of the
14,000 jobs it once had in Southern California.
   A House-Senate conference will iron out differences
between the two bills. Small-business lobbyists believe the
favorable House provisions will be retained in the final
clean air package sent to President Bush.

   IT'S A MYTH that small businesses create most of the
nation's jobs, three economists argue in a new book,
"Employers Large and Small," (Harvard University Press). The
book, by Harvard's James Medoff and James Hamilton and
University of Michigan's Charles Brown, seeks to debunk the
theory, prominently espoused by economist and consultant
David Birch, that most job growth depends on entrepreneurs.
The authors argue that when the high failure rate of small
concerns is considered, they create jobs roughly in
proportion to their share of the work force. Mr. Birch
counters that federal studies support his view that small
firms create a disproportionate share of new jobs.

   A NEW CANDIDATE emerges for the Small Business
Administration's chief counsel for advocacy, a post vacant
since last fall. Robert Hsueh, an immigration lawyer from
Texas, has been through the rigorous government background
check and is expected to be the nominee. The Bush
administration's last nominee, educator Kyo Jhin, withdrew
from consideration in February.

   BUDGET GIMMICKRY? Small firms are wary about current
fiscal talks.
   "There's no deficit crisis, there's a political crisis,"
charges Lawrence Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. He contends that some lawmakers are
trying to scare the public with talk of a vastly more
expensive savings and loan industry bail-out in order to
raise taxes and avoid politically painful spending cuts.
   Another proposal for a capital gains tax cut is expected
to come out of the summit, but it may get a lukewarm
reception from small business. Such interests say very small
companies won't benefit from the cut, and medium-sized ones
fear it will carry a price tag -- other hefty taxes. A major
worry of many small businesses: new environmental taxes,
aimed at forcing companies to recycle solvents and other
materials. "All you have to do is cloak yourself in the good
flag of environmentalism and you can tax . . . all sorts of
things," says Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National
Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
   National Small Business United says its members are
willing to face some tax increases, but only if there are
also real spending cuts.

   SMALL TALK: Some 18% of small manufacturers surveyed this
year by the National Association of Manufacturers said they
derive from 5% to 10% of their revenue from exports. Only 12%
put exports at that level when surveyed in 1989. . . . Mad at
