   Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., Toronto, canceled its plan to
offer 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34 million) in common
shares and share-purchase warrants, citing recent declines in
prices of gold and the company's shares. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, Agnico shares closed at
$7, up 37.5 cents.
   The offering price wouldn't reflect Agnico's value, the
company said, noting it will rely for now on its own
resources to finance the early stages of a planned
three-year, C$32 million exploration and development program.
Agnico said it is considering other means of raising funds.

   The offering was opposed by Jacques Forget, a Montreal
businessman who owns about 3% of Agnico and had notified it
that he intended to ask a court to block the issue. Agnico
said its cancellation of the offering, which was to be priced
soon, wasn't related to Mr. Forget's actions. Mr. Forget said
that the injunction isn't needed now, but that he still
opposes Agnico's management and will continue to try to
establish a holder group to pursue a takeover bid for Agnico,
which wouldn't comment on Mr. Forget's plan to change
management.
