   BUSH OPENED talks with Gorbachev amid differences over
Germany and trade.
   Meeting in Washington for their second summit, the
president and the Soviet leader held what were described as
"upbeat" discussions, but failed to settle differences over
the future of a united Germany. Soviet negotiators,
meanwhile, indicated that they mightn't sign the five-year
pact to buy U.S. grain, a position apparently tied to Bush's
reluctance to sign a trade treaty because of Moscow's
resistance to Lithuanian independence. Opposing views also
were stated on conventional arms cuts. The two leaders,
however, are expected to sign agreements today to reduce
chemical-weapons production and to establish rules for
verifying nuclear-test limits.

   Israel urged the U.S. to end all contacts with the PLO
after seaborne Palestinian guerrillas loyal to a top PLO
official tried to attack crowded beaches on a Jewish holiday.
But Arafat said that the PLO wasn't responsible for
Wednesday's incident near Tel Aviv, and that he hadn't the
authority to take action against the official.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution to send
a three-member commission to the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip to recommend ways to protect Palestinians. The
draft had been supported by 14 of the council's 15 members.

   East German lawmakers voted to give the government broad
authority to seize land, houses and businesses controlled by
members of the old Communist regime. The action freezes the
party's vast holdings a month before the nation merges its
economy with West Germany's and begins transferring state
property to the private sector.

   The State Department ordered Americans to leave Liberia

Wednesday on a refugee compound.

   NASA workers pinpointed a tiny leak in the space shuttle
Columbia's rear compartment, but judged it too small to have
caused the hydrogen leak that delayed Wednesday's scheduled
launch. Space agency officials said the spacecraft's
astronomy mission would be on hold for at least another week
as work to repair the orbiter continues.

   The U.S. has granted political asylum to a Chinese couple
who fled because of Beijing's family-planning laws, their
lawyer said. They are the first known refugees to be granted
sanctuary under an order issued by Bush in November that
established fear of forced abortion as a ground for asylum.
                                                                                                       

   Three Chinese dissidents disappeared after abruptly
canceling a conference in Beijing where they had planned to
make a public appeal for the release of political prisoners.
Friends of rock singer Hou Dejian and two intellectuals said
they had left the Chinese capital on "personal business."

people.
