   Simone de Beauvoir was an instant celebrity after the
publication of her pioneering feminist book, "The Second
Sex," in 1949. By the 1970s she was "sacred monster" to the
radical feminists whose sexual politics had supplanted hers.
She ended up a lionized if somewhat compromised figure.
Untrusting, self-absorbed, alcoholic, de Beauvoir doesn't
arouse much sympathy.
   Deirdre Bair has written a huge, heroic book that focuses
on de Beauvoir's contribution to intellectual history, though
the unflattering minutiae that fill many of its pages make de
Beauvoir look small and fallible. Ms. Bair seems predisposed
to take the optimistic view of her subject in this avowedly
"feminist" biography, "Simone de Beauvoir" (Summit, 718
pages, $24.95), even when history and her own hard research
shine a darker light.

   During the five years before de Beauvoir's death in 1986
of cirrhosis, Ms. Bair, winner of the National Book Award for
her biography of Samuel Beckett, visited her at 11 rue
Schoelcher, where de Beauvoir lived alone with her books, TV,
travel collectibles, and a refrigerator which blocked the
foyer. Having flushed her morning vodka from her system, de
Beauvoir poured them each an ounce of Scotch.
   With the Montparnasse cemetery outside, they discussed her
life. De Beauvoir had told Ms. Bair she wished to be
remembered as a writer, not the feminist author of "The
Second Sex," and they considered forming a "biographical Hall
of Mirrors." When de Beauvoir died, Ms. Bair was left to her
own interpretations. The result is the woman as feminist
heroine -- the role de Beauvoir resented because it eclipsed
her other achievements.
   Working the often unheroic facts of de Beauvoir's life
into feminism's agenda is not easy. She was not, this
feminist biography notwithstanding, a woman's woman.
Threatened by intellectual female writers, she avoided them.
Lest her friends prefer one another, she prevented them from
meeting. She screened worshipful female students as partners
for her lifelong companion, Jean-Paul Sartre, apparently
seducing several first herself. In her autobiographical first
novel, about a love triangle, she kills off the rival
protagonist.
   Ms. Bair seems both to love and be appalled by her
subject. A voyeuristic prig whose unlikely pastime, in her
late teens, was masquerading as a prostitute in Paris bars,
de Beauvoir slipped past remonstrating Catholic parents to
the Sorbonne, where she performed compulsively well in
philosophy -- an unladylike department, by her mother's
standards -- and met Sartre.
   The couple got off to a great start. But soon he was
denting her thin emotional armor, swallowing handfuls of the
stimulant Corydrane as if they were vitamins and making
frenzied love to teen-agers. At one point, their world grew
so self-referential they fixated on each other's hands, with
Sartre looking on while de Beauvoir spent hours applying
garish nail polish (incongruous on a woman who wore torn
dresses and hated to wash her hair).
   In occupied Paris, despite paper rationing and censorship,
they furthered their careers. While Sartre played
buffoonishly at Resistance activity, forming an ersatz cell
as though no established movement existed, de Beauvoir
published for the first time, and from 1943 drew a weekly
paycheck from the German-run state radio. Ms. Bair handles
the charges of "moral collaboration" and "opportunism" by
adopting a strangely inappropriate language of "feelings."
They "did what they felt they needed to do in order to
survive. If they felt better about their actions by analyzing
and explaining them . . . their equivocations should probably
be judged accordingly."
   Following de Beauvoir's lead, Ms. Bair treats the genesis
and composition of "The Second Sex" sentimentally, quoting de
Beauvoir's remark about conceiving her 900-page masterwork
"almost by chance." She portrays de Beauvoir in a sober
ecstasy of research and writing, processing details of her
friends' lesbianism, Sartre's precepts, and books like "The
Kinsey Report" sent by her mostly long-distance lover Nelson
Algren. Finally, she cranked out the chapters fortified by
liquor and pep pills.
   Ms. Bair devotes much of the book's last third to the "The
Second Sex's" reception: jeers, obscene hate mail, awe,
international acclaim. De Beauvoir became public property,
like a film star, her "lopsided" relationship with Sartre in
the spotlight. In public a feminist bulwark, de Beauvoir
privately dismissed (Ms. Bair tells us in the notes) critics
of her perceived enslavement to Sartre: "I'm sorry to
disappoint all the feminists, but you can say that it's too
bad so many of them live only in theory instead of in real
life."
   The theory and reality of de Beauvoir's life were two
different matters. Born into the "belle epoque" and raised as
a spoiled bourgeois girl, she was a feminist by default: She
didn't fit well into the world of women as it existed, and
when she described her dissatisfaction she spawned a
movement. As one of its first leaders, she sometimes came up
short. And so her messy life occasionally locks the wheels of
Ms. Bair's big, sleek feminist vehicle.
