affected by a correction from the Pacific Stock Exchange on
the price of Philip Morris Cos. stock, to $43.625 a share
from the originally reported $42.50. This change caused the
following index revisions: the household products industry
group to 509.81 from 503.74 originally; the non-cyclical
consumer sector to 507.06 from 505.98, and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index to 335.56 from 335.42.
