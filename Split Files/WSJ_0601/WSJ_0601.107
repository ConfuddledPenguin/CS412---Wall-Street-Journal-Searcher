   Rent a car and you may get taken for a ride. Despite
recent reform efforts, the car-rental industry is still
riddled with questionable tactics and outright rip-offs. Even
established outfits run misleading ads, spring mysterious,
last-minute surcharges on customers, and arm-twist people
into buying such options as car-rental insurance that they
don't want -- or need. Individually, most of these tactics
don't involve big money. But on a national scale, the
consumer abuse is huge: For car-rental insurance alone,
travelers may waste an estimated $1 billion a year. "The
potential for getting ripped off by some of these companies
is almost legendary," says Monte Belote, administrative
director for the Florida Consumer Action Network, a consumer
lobby group. Even rental-car officials concede that growing
competition has led to some shoddy practices -- and that the
industry's image is sinking fast. One Florida restaurant
chain, in fact, runs commercials lampooning rental-car firms.
(The car is cheap, but the keys are extra, the commercial
says, while the restaurant doesn't even charge extra for
baked potatoes.) Some rental companies are trying harder --
to clean up their act. Hertz Corp. has campaigned heavily on
state bills to ban car-rental insurance. And Alamo Rent A Car
gives people a precalculated bill before they rent. The
National Association of Attorneys General has also tried to
step in, by issuing advertising guidelines for the industry a
year ago. But it hasn't been enough -- as a recent renting
spree disclosed. A reporter for this newspaper spent three
days in Florida -- the world's largest individual car-rental
market -- studying car rentals. "The industry's reputation in
a place like Florida is lousy," concedes Frank Olson,
chairman of Hertz. Here's a look at some of the biggest
problems:

   RATE TACTICS
                                                                                                       

   Superior Rent A Car isn't a household name, but it's big
enough to run full-page ads in the Miami Yellow Pages. So
bargain hunters notice Superior's $69-a-week rate. Problem
is, the rate applies only to cars with manual transmissions.
Such tactics are nothing new, but they seem to be growing
with the proliferation of smaller firms. One outfit, American
International Rent-A-Car, quoted a rate of $15 a day over the
phone; that turned out to be good only if you drive fewer
than 25 miles a day. (Drive farther, and you pay 25 cents for
each extra mile, or $26 a day for unlimited mileage.) And
some agencies offered rock-bottom rates for cars that didn't
have air conditioning. "We're talking 90-degree weather and
no AC," says Jordan Courtney, of Duxbury, Mass., after
sweltering for a week in Key West. "It was terrible."
                                                                                                       

   WAIVE THIS FEE
                                                                                                       

   Consumer groups say most people probably don't need to
spend $8 to $12 a day for the "collision damage waiver,"
which is essentially an agreement that you won't be charged
for damage. People's own insurance policies or their credit
cards usually cover such damage. But car-rental companies
manage to get as many as a third of their customers to buy
the waiver, through coaxing, scare tactics and outright
deception. At the Thrifty Car Rental counter in Miami,
travelers who refused the waiver were asked to sign a special
statement (which Thrifty says it has since yanked), agreeing
to pay for any damage "including the full market value of the
car." One rental agent from Dollar Rent A Car was even
blunter: He handed this reporter a contract with the "accept"
box already circled. "Just initial for the waiver here," he
said, without any explanation. (Dollar says that violated
company policy.) And at Exchange Car Rental, Keith Johnson
says he bought the waiver after an agent threatened to put a
$1,000 block on his credit card. "Basically, I had to take
it," says Mr. Johnson, of Woodlands Hills, Calif. "They
sounded so convincing." Convincing maybe, but dead wrong.
Credit-card companies say they don't allow car-rental firms
to take such credit blocks. Exchange, which is under new
ownership, says it stopped that practice last week. Contrary
to what most car-rental firms were telling people at the
counter, the waiver doesn't cover "everything." Dollar, for
instance, says it voids its waiver in Florida if the car is
stolen. The waiver at several other companies didn't cover
glass or tire damage. And according to the National
Association of Attorneys General, some companies canceled the
waiver protection if the driver had taken any drugs,
including aspirin.
                                                                                                       

   EXTRA CHARGES
                                                                                                       

   Car-rental firms keep dreaming up fees that annoy and
mystify people. National Car Rental charged $10 a day to rent
a baby seat (which only cost $50 to buy). Budget Rent a Car
in Miami wanted $8 extra just to let another person drive the
car, and another $7 a day for each driver under 25 years old.
Last year, some outfits imposed a special fee for Latin
American visitors -- because they supposedly had bad driving
records. Most large car-rental firms are also getting into
the liability-insurance business. They used to give each
customer hundreds of thousands of dollars of
liability-insurance coverage in case customers were sued for
a death or injury. Today, most car renters get only a
fraction of that protection unless they spend an extra $4 to
$6 a day for added coverage. These fees have a way of adding
up shockingly fast. Allen Taylor, for example, recently
walked out of an Alamo rental plaza in Tampa with a slightly
dazed look. He had rented a car for a base rate of $179 for
two weeks -- but wound up paying almost twice that after
buying the liability insurance, gasoline and tax. "I know
they explain all these fees, but it's all so confusing," says
Mr. Taylor, a sales manager from Canada.
                                                                                                       

   WASTING GASOLINE
                                                                                                       

   Many car-rental agencies give drivers a full tank of
gasoline and tell them to return it full. But Dollar and some
others give Florida renters half a tank -- and charge them
about $10 for it. The renters are then supposed to return the
car as empty as possible, because they don't get any credit
for unused fuel. The car-rental agency can then resell any
remaining gasoline to the next customer. Dollar argues that
renters prefer this method, because they don't have to bother
refilling the tank. But George McPeck, an engineer from
Venezuela, was determined to leave his rental with "only the
gas fumes in the tank." But he ended up disappointed that a
few gallons were still left when he returned the car. "It's
not as easy wasting gas as you'd think," he says.
                                                                                                       

   CORPORATE BARGAINS?
                                                                                                       

   Each year, hundreds of companies negotiate special
corporate rates from rental-car firms. But there wasn't
anything special about the $41-a-day corporate rate that
Hertz, Avis and National quoted to this reporter. Customers
without corporate rates were paying 25% less. How can that
be? The major car-rental firms point out that corporate rates
often include free insurance, mileage and other perks. But
even they concede that some promotional rates are better. (In
fact, the corporate rate in Florida didn't include free
mileage, while the discount rates did.) The best answer,
consumer experts say, is just to ask for the lower of the two
rates. That's not always easy. A National agent in Miami
refused to give this reporter the promotional rate, insisting
that the corporate rate was mandatory for employees at some
companies. "Your company has negotiated it that way," she
said. A National spokesman concedes that comment wasn't true.
                                                                                                       

   RATE OF RETURN
                                                                                                       

   At the airport rental-car counter in Miami, Robert Woods
has just learned that National is charging him a full extra
day because he kept the car a few hours past deadline. "I was
told I could bring it back anytime today," he says loudly,
demanding to see a manager. A few years ago, Mr. Woods, a
railroad conductor, mightn't have had this problem. But
car-rental companies have become a lot more hard-nosed about
return times, and now operate on a 24-hour-clock basis.
Worse, some now levy extra-day rates that are higher than
their promotional rates. National, for example, charged Mr.
Woods $39 for the extra day, more than 25% above the best
discount rate that day.
                                                                                                       

   CHECK FOR SCRATCHES
                                                                                                       

   Savvy renters who decline the waiver always inspect the
car right away; otherwise, they can be held responsible for
the slightest damage. And when we say slightest, we mean
slightest. When this reporter returned an Alamo car in Tampa,
an employee noticed a scratch on the trunk. The scratch
wasn't big enough to show up on three Polaroid pictures that
Alamo took, but the rental agency, which says it carefully
records the condition of its cars, insisted that the car was
damaged. "Trust me, it probably won't cost you much," an
Alamo agent said.
