   PONTIAC, Mich. -- First Federal Bancorp Inc. said the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision has placed strict limits
on the thrift's lending operations because of its inability
to meet new capital requirements.
   First Federal said a group of investors whom it identified
only as current shareholders has offered to infuse $40
million in cash into the company. In return, it said, the
investors want newly issued First Federal shares. The
transaction is designed to enable First Federal's operating
units to meet the federal capital requirements, the thrift
said.

   However, the transaction would "significantly dilute"
current holders' stakes, the company said. First Federal has
3.5 million shares outstanding. The company's stock closed at
$2.25 a share, up 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.
   First Federal said it will continue to explore ways to
improve its capital position, including the possibilities
offered by the cash infusion.
   The restrictions imposed by regulators bar First Federal
from increasing its assets and forbid it to sell or pledge
assets or to make any new loans or investments without prior
U.S. approval. But First Federal may use assets to maintain
adequate liquidity for current obligations, and it may make
certain consumer and home loans.
   The restrictions apply to First Federal's chief operating
subsidiaries, First Federal Savings Bank &amp; Trust, based in
Pontiac, and Citizens Federal Savings Bank, Jacksonville,
Fla.
   Federal authorities imposed the restrictions Wednesday
after First Federal failed to meet new U.S. guidelines for
thrifts' ratios of capital to assets.
   In the quarter ended March 31, First Federal had a loss of
$15.2 million, or $4.20 a share.
