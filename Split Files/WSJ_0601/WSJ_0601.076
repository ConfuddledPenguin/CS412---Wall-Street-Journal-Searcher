   WASHINGTON -- Halsey Taylor Co. agreed to replace certain
water coolers that had lead-contaminated tanks, but only if
the owners provide the company with test results from a
qualified laboratory.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which negotiated
the consent agreement with the company, said the tests can
cost as much as $30.

   In January, the Environmental Protection Agency said six
models of Halsey Taylor coolers made before 1979 may have
lead-lined tanks that could affect the drinking water in
them. Ingestion of lead can cause severe health problems,
particularly for children. Children who ingest lead can
suffer mental retardation and growth impairment. Lead also
damages fetuses when it's ingested by pregnant women.
   Vernon Hills, Ill.-based Halsey Taylor, a major
manufacturer of water coolers, is a division of Scotsman
Industries Inc. In agreeing to the order, it didn't
acknowledge that its coolers were contaminated.
   Under the CPSC program, customers may choose to be repaid
a portion of the cost of the machine, based on its age.
   Under its agreement with the consumer agency, Halsey
Taylor will notify all daycare centers with more than 10
children, as well as public and private schools, colleges,
and boys and girls clubs of its replacement program. Water
cooler owners who wish to participate in the program can get
further information by calling a toll-free number, (800)
635-2358.
