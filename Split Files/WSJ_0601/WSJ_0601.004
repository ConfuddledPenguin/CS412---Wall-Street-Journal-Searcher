   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Dick Weaver can recall many a mad,
sweat-drenched scramble through thicket and ravine hoping to
catch a mountain lion. More times than not, the lion --
despite a pack of well-trained dogs on its tail -- gave Mr.
Weaver the slip, sometimes by flight, sometimes by fang.
"Dogs have been killed by the lions they chase," he says.
   "People who think this isn't fair chase need to go along
once and try it," agrees Terry Mansfield, a veteran of a
dozen mountain-lion chases. Mr. Weaver is a recently retired
40-year veteran of California's Department of Fish and Game;
Mr. Mansfield is the department's chief fish and wildlife
manager.

   Their weapons of choice on mountain lion hunts have been
tranquilizer darts and radio collars as part of the state's
extended cat-counting effort. The official conclusion is that
the California lion, its ranks once perilously thinned by
decades of bounty hunting, has rebounded spectacularly after
18 years of scrupulous state protection.
   The state says there now are perhaps 5,000 mountain lions
in California. In the vernacular of modern game management,
those are "harvestable" numbers -- high enough that the state
has been proposing (unsuccessfully) since 1987 to allow
hunters to kill up to 190 lions a year.
   State Fish and Game officials, in pushing sport hunting of
lions, find themselves with a political tiger by the tail.
Contending that game managers have inflated lion numbers to
promote a sport that borders on barbarism, lion lovers have
bypassed the thickets of state bureaucracy and gone straight
to the voters with a measure that would ban trophy hunting of
the big cats, also known as cougars.
   They have come armed with a powerful image that makes even
the pro-hunting lobby squirm: Because the secretive,
150-pound lions are too wily to be stalked, hunters use
tenacious hounds to chase them up a tree. Once treed -- and
often exhausted -- the lions are shot point-blank with
high-powered rifles.
   "This is not sport," says Sharon Negri, director of the
Mountain Lion Preservation Foundation, which helped collect
signatures to get the lion protection measure on the ballot.
"This is slaughter."
   Indeed, if the initiative, to be decided by voters on
Tuesday, were merely a referendum on lion hunting, the
largely pro-hunting coalition that opposes it likely would
have conceded defeat. Polls by both sides show that up to 80%
of voters, including many hunters, tend to agree with Ms.
Negri, especially since lions are valued for neither food nor
fur and typically end up as trophies on a wall.
   But the measure does much more than cast an anti-hunting
net over the lion: It will cost almost $1 billion over the
next 30 years, a price tag that has been seized by its
detractors in attempting to untrack it. That money will go to
acquire habitat, though not just for lions; two-thirds of it
will be earmarked for other rare and endangered California
species. Some of the land might be used for other purposes,
such as parks, but the animals couldn't be disturbed.
   Conservationists, viewing the annual influx of 600,000 new
residents into a state whose population has tripled since
1945, say the mountain lion will inevitably be crowded out of
its native range unless lion habitat is put aside. The theory
is both ambitious and novel: an attempt to require government
to protect a species, and safeguard its habitat, before it
falls into the threatened category.
   "It does little good to protect lions from hunters if they
don't have a place to roam," says Gerald Meral, director of
the California Planning and Conservation League, among the
many environmental groups campaigning for Proposition 117.
The environmentalists point to Florida, where unbridled
development has reduced the Florida panther, the mountain
lion's once-common first cousin, to as few as 30 animals, on
the verge of extinction.
   The struggle over the lion has been a cat fight for two
decades. Between 1916 and 1971, the lions, which range from
the state's southern deserts to its northernmost coastal rain
forests, were considered a nuisance and hunted for bounties;
more than 12,000 were killed. With evidence that the numbers
of lions were in steep decline, Gov. Ronald Reagan approved a
moratorium on lion hunting in 1971.That moratorium stayed in
place until 1985, when Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed a bill
that would have extended it while biologists measured the
lion population.
   But when Fish and Game attempted to open a lion hunting
season, Ms. Negri's group and others blocked the hunts in
court, convincing state judges that the department hadn't
adequately assessed the lion population before deciding there
were huntable numbers.
   Finally, the cat's friends, sure that the state would
persist in its lion-hunting efforts, collected 700,000
signatures last year to force Prop 117 onto the ballot. "In
truth, many of us didn't want to do an initiative," says Ms.
Negri. "But the people want to see the mountain lion
protected. We believe you can't take a good-ole-boy
management program and shove it down the people's throat."
   Prop 117 proponents say $30 million a year is a small
price to pay -- just 1/20th of 1% of California's annual
budget. But the price tag has provided an issue for
opponents, including the National Rifle Association, to
scratch away at support in a state where the mere whiff of
extravagant spending can doom a measure.
   Mr. Weaver, the retired Fish and Game man, is heading an
umbrella organization called Californians for Fair Spending
on Wildlife Protection. He says the cost is particularly
onerous considering the state's conclusion that the lion --
far from threatened -- may be overabundant in some places.
   Game officials cite statistics that the number of lions
killed after preying on livestock or other domestic animals
is up from about 10 a year in the 1970s to 72 last year. They
also note that while the lion is indeed rare or non-existent
in most states east of the Mississippi River, mountain lions
thrive in 11 other Western states, all of which continue to
allow annual hunts.
   Mr. Weaver also argues that since only half of the $30
million in annual habitat spending would come from new
sources, the other half probably would come at the expense of
existing habitat and species protection programs. This, he
says, "is bad game management."
   Mr. Weaver's coalition has also gotten support from
unlikely sources: a sprinkling of state health-care
providers. Last year, voters approved a new tobacco tax, with
most of the money going to health programs. But some of that
tobacco-tax money would also be used in the land acquisition
program. The health workers worry about health programs going
begging for the benefit of saving wildlife. The NRA and other
Prop 117 opponents have picked up on that argument, telling
voters that the initiative isn't bad because it bans hunting,
but because it steals health care from widows, orphans and
indigents.
   Mr. Weaver's coalition also includes the California
Cattlemen's Association and the state's Farm Bureau
Federation, whose members object to further public land
acquisitions; half of California is in public ownership
already. They also worry about increased lion attacks on
livestock, though the initiative continues to allow hunters
to kill lions feeding on farm animals.
   In any case, all this is much ado about nothing, argues
Jim Gibbons, coordinator of California Houndsmen for
Conservation, a 5,000-member hunting group that opposes Prop
117. Mr. Gibbons insists that his members mostly just want to
chase the lions to take pictures of them, which has always
been allowed. "The thrill of the sport is to run the things
and catch them," he says. "Most of our guys shoot with
cameras."
   If Proposition 117 passes, however, hunters can even leave
their cameras at home: The measure appears to outlaw chase of
lions by dogs for any reason.
