   WASHINGTON -- Agricultural prices in May rose 2% from the
previous month as strong demand for pork and tight supplies
sent hog prices soaring to their second-highest level ever,
the Agriculture Department said.
   Hog prices hit $60.50 per 100 pounds in May, up $6.70 from
April and up $18.90 from a year earlier, the department said.
The record high of $62.10 came in August 1986.

   The surge in prices received by hog producers portend a
15% jump in retail prices for bacon and other pork products
by year end, economists said. Retail pork prices in the first
four months of the year were already up 9% from the
year-before period.
   The near-record prices reflect, among other things, a 15%
drop in pork imports and a 26% jump in U.S. pork exports
during the first quarter, a 25% decline in cold storage of
pork from a year ago and a slight slowdown in hog
slaughtering.
   "I can remember only one other time in the last 25 years
when we had these many price factors go positive for higher
prices at one time," said Glenn Grimes, a University of
Missouri agricultural economist and consultant to the
National Pork Producers Council.
   As a result, prices for barrows and gilts rose $7 to
$61.20 per 100 pounds in May, while sows rose $2.90 to $51.60
per 100 pounds, the department said.
   "The probabilities are very high for hog prices to stay
very strong through at least August," said Mr. Grimes. "We
think the odds are high that retail prices will go up
somewhere in the range of 15%."
   Overall farm prices in May were up 3.4% from last year,
according to the department. Beef cattle prices averaged
$74.30 per 100 pounds, down 30 cents from April. Prices for
steers and heifers were also down 30 cents, while cows rose
50 cents.
   Corn prices averaged $2.66 per bushel in May, up 15 cents,
and sorghum grain averaged $4.10 per 100 pounds, up 21 cents.
Barley prices slipped one cent in May to $2.21 per bushel,
while oats were unchanged at $1.44 per bushel, the department
said.
   Egg prices averaged 51.2 cents per dozen, down 13 cents
from April, the department said. Broiler prices rose two
cents per pound in May to 35.2 cents, and turkeys edged up
1.2 cents per pound to 38.2 cents.
   Milk prices averaged $13.20 per 100 pounds in May, down 20
cents from the previous month, but up 90 cents from a year
earlier, the department said. Fruit prices, led by oranges
and grapefruits, climbed 3.6% in May, while vegetable prices,
led by lettuce and tomatoes, rose 3.4%.
