   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission voted
to seek comment on a proposal that would make it easier for
U.S. shareholders in foreign companies to take advantage of
tender and exchange offers.
   The proposal was drafted in response to concerns that
bidders for shares of foreign issues sometimes deliberately
exclude U.S. shareholders to avoid the cost of complying with
U.S. disclosure requirements.

   The proposal would allow such offers to proceed without
complying with U.S. requirements if the U.S. securities
holdings constitute a relatively small portion of the entire
transaction.
   The SEC is seeking comment on what the level of U.S.
holdings should be. "This is an area that will become more
and more important as there are more foreign-issued
securities purchased by U.S. investors," said Linda Quinn,
head of the SEC's division of corporation finance. "People
are being substantially affected in the value of their
investments when they get carved out" of exchange and tender
offers, she said. The commission is expected to take public
comments on the proposal for about 120 days.
   The SEC also approved a rule proposed by the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board to require underwriters of
municipal bonds to provide the board with copies of final
official statements on bond issues, and to create a reference
room where the public could obtain copies of official
documents. The commission approved the MSRB proposal by a
vote of 3-1.
