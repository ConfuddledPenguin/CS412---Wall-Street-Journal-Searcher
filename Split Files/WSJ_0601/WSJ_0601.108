   LOUISVILLE, Colo. -- Storage Technology Corp. said it will
retire its $210 million outstanding of 13.5% senior
debentures due in 1996, saving about $25 million a year in
interest.
   The maker of data storage devices said it will redeem
debentures of record June 11 for 104.48% of par. The company
issued about $285 million of the bonds, along with stock and
cash, when it emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings in
1987. It has been trying for about a year to find ways to
retire the high-cost debt. This year, it has redeemed $34
million of the debentures and bought about $40 million of
them on the open market.

   As a result of the planned redemption, Storage Technology
said it will record an extraordinary second-quarter charge of
about $4.6 million. In the second quarter last year, it had
net income of $4.4 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue
of $163.8 million.
   The company said it will pay for the redemption with
proceeds from a stock offering in March and a recently
completed offering of 8% convertible subordinated debentures
due 2015.
