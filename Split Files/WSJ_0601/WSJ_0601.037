   TOKYO -- Japan's steel exports in April dropped 23% to 1.4
million metric tons from a year earlier, the Japan Iron and
Steel Federation said.
   Shipments to all major markets showed substantial
year-to-year declines, except for those to the U.S., which
fell a modest 1% to 287,000 metric tons. A metric ton is
equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. Total exports in April,
mostly based on contracts signed last December, were down 7%
from the previous month. The exports have declined from
year-earlier levels in every month but one since August 1986.

   With Japan's economy in its 42nd consecutive month of
expansion, steelmakers have been preoccupied with meeting
strong demand from domestic industries, such as auto making,
shipbuilding and construction.
   April's exports were relatively unaffected by the weakness
of the yen since the beginning of the year. Lower
dollar-denominated prices of Japanese steel may push up
exports to the U.S. and Southeast Asian countries, but the
gains are likely to be offset by continuing declines in
shipments to the Soviet Union and China.
