   HONG KONG -- The government says it will admit more
foreign workers into this British colony, but businessmen and
economists say the increase isn't enough to overcome a
persistent labor shortage or to slow wage inflation.
   K.Y. Yeung, secretary for education and manpower, said
Hong Kong will allow as many as 10,000 semiskilled workers to
enter this year in addition to 2,000 construction workers
already due to arrive for jobs on a huge airport and port
project.

   Mr. Yeung said the foreign-worker program is an extension
of one started in April 1989 that allowed for the selective
introduction of technicians and skilled laborers from abroad.
That program has brought in 2,700 skilled workers. A quota of
2,700 for that program also was announced for this year,
bringing to 14,700 the total of skilled and semiskilled
workers that may be imported in 1990.
   However, Ian Christie, director of the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce, estimates that there are "at least"
165,000 or 170,000 job vacancies in Hong Kong. For three
years, the chamber and other business associations have been
lobbying for large-scale imports of labor.
   "I've got to be pleased that the government has at long
last seen fit to move in the right direction," Mr. Christie
said. "But this is only a very small percentage. It isn't
likely to depress wage increases."
   The tight labor market and rapidly rising wages are
factors in the colony's high inflation of the past two years.
Inflation was about 10% in 1989 and ran at a 9.4% annual rate
in the first quarter of 1990, according to government
figures.
   The government says nominal earnings for manufacturing
workers at the end of 1989 were 15% higher than at the end of
1988, or 5% higher after inflation. Real, or
inflation-adjusted, earnings of service employees were 6%
higher, and real earnings of construction workers were up 7%.
   The labor-importation program "could have a modest effect"
on this wage inflation "if the measures are concentrated on
the critical areas," said Miron Mushkat, director of regional
economic research for Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
Among the areas most in need of workers are manufacturing,
construction and hotels and restaurants, he said.
   The 10,000 semiskilled workers -- defined as those with at
least one year's job experience and not in need of vocational
training -- are aimed at helping businesses most hurt by the
labor shortage. The government said half the quota is
expected to go to the clothing industry, to wholesale, retail
and import-export trades and to hotel, catering and
tourism-related businesses.
   Labor unions, which have opposed labor imports, argue that
employers will use foreign workers to undercut local pay
scales and benefits.
   But Mr. Yeung said the government will only consider
applications from employers proposing to pay at least the
median wage for the industry. In addition, employers will be
required to provide housing, medical treatment and
transportation to and from Hong Kong, and imported workers
will have two-year contracts. However, if there are layoffs,
the imported workers will be first affected, Mr. Yeung said.
   He also repeated a government promise that there will be
no "large-scale importation" of unskilled labor into Hong
Kong.
   The 2,000 construction workers to be allowed in were
described as an "initial" allotment; the project to build an
international airport and container port is expected to
require more than 20,000 workers by middle of the decade. The
multibilliondollar project is scheduled to be finished by
1997, the year Hong Kong is due to revert to Chinese rule.
   Local businesses began calling on the government to relax
its rules on imported workers more than three years ago. At
that time, the colony's factories and businesses were working
near their capacity, and exports were expanding at
double-digit rates. The export boom hit as growth in the
labor pool was slowing because of declining birth rates and a
1980 cut in immigration from China.
   Hong Kong allows the hiring of expatriate managers and
professionals on a case-by-case basis. It also has allowed
the importation of more than 50,000 domestic helpers on
two-year contracts.
   The government initially resisted calls for importing
workers for other areas, maintaining that the labor shortage
would ease as the economy slowed down. It also said it wanted
to ensure that Hong Kong residents gained from the colony's
economic success. However, the shortage has persisted despite
a cooling of the economy that worsened in the wake of last
year's political turmoil in China.
   The government estimates that gross domestic product will
increase 3% in 1990, compared with 2.5% in 1989.
   While the number of job vacancies reported has declined in
some sectors, it remains high. Last December, the latest
reporting date, manufacturers reported 36,200 vacancies, down
30% from December 1988. A total of 86,900 vacancies was
reported by major business sectors in December 1989,
according to government figures. Private estimates of total
vacancies range up to 200,000.
   Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 1.7% in the first
quarter of 1990 from an average of 1.35% during 1989. But,
economists say, 1.7% still represents a tight labor market.
They say 2.5% to 3% unemployment would still be considered
"full employment" for Hong Kong.
   Further exacerbating the tight labor supply is the
increasing emigration from the colony ahead of the 1997
Chinese takeover. According to some estimates, 1,000 people
are leaving Hong Kong each week.
