   DENVER -- Presidio Oil Co. said it is considering selling
its West Virginia oil- and gas-producing properties and
gas-gathering systems or forming a joint venture with a
partner capable of helping fund drilling in the area.
   Presidio, an oil and gas concern, said that it has about
76 billion cubic feet of gas in West Virginia, or about 15%
of its oil and gas reserves. It said proceeds from any sale
of the properties would be used to reduce its $145 million in
bank debt.

to advise it about a possible transaction.
