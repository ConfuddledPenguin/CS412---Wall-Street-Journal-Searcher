   SYDNEY -- The bad debt expenses of banks in Australia more
than doubled during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989,
reaching almost three billion Australian dollars (US$2.32
billion), according to a new KPMG Peat Marwick 1990 Financial
Institutions Performance Survey.
   In announcing the survey results, Michael Ullmer, chairman
of KPMG Peat Marwick's Banking Industry Group, attributed the
increase in bad debt expenses to aggressive lending to
entrepreneurs coupled with the government's high
interest-rate policy in 1988 and 1989.
