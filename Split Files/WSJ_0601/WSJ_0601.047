   BankAmerica Corp. won the government's bidding contest to
acquire the insolvent Western Savings &amp; Loan Association,
Arizona's second-largest thrift, in a transaction that marks
the rejuvenated bank holding company's first acquisition of a
thrift or bank in that state.
   Late last night BankAmerica confirmed it is paying $81
million to acquire Western, marking one of the larger
premiums that the federal Resolution Trust Corp. has received
in its efforts to liquidate its bulging inventory of troubled
thrifts. The bank said the acquisition covers the thrift's 61
branches, $3.5 billion in deposits and $3.5 billion in
assets, including $1 billion in consumer and residential
mortgage loans and $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

   The bank said it has an option to return those loans that
don't meet certain criteria to the RTC.
   The government is still expected to take a loss of $1.3
billion, at the least, in disposing of Western's assets.
BankAmerica noted that the RTC will be retaining Western's
commercial real estate loans, certain other commercial loans
as well as all nonperforming assets.
   Phoenix-based Western Savings, with some $4.6 billion in
assets, was taken over by the government last June after
piling up huge loan losses related to the Arizona commercial
real-estate bust and other soured ventures. At Dec. 31, it
reportedly had a shareholder deficit of about $1.4 billion,
making it one of the larger single contributors to the
increasingly enormous cost of bailing out the sick industry.
   For BankAmerica, the acquisition shows how the
once-troubled banking concern, which now has the strongest
capital base of the 10 largest U.S. banking concerns, is
using its new-found financial muscle to expand gradually
through acquisition.
   "I think the timing of the entree is excellent. Things are
pretty well washed out in Arizona," said Don Crowley, a San
Francisco bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
"Granted, a lot has been frittered away because of the
problems, but it is a good base to begin with in Arizona."
BankAmerica already operates a mortgage company in Arizona.
   The amount of deposits that BankAmerica ultimately retains
could be substantially smaller than the current $3.5 billion
total. Only some $1.8 billion of the total are so-called core
retail deposits, with the balance being high-yield brokered
deposits and other funds. Under federal law, BankAmerica has
the discretion to reset interest rates almost immediately on
those brokered funds, which would probably reduce the total
amount it retains.
   The price BankAmerica is paying is equal to about 4.6% of
Western's core deposits, which analysts consider on the high
side, perhaps partly reflecting the fact that several other
banking concerns, including Security Pacific Corp. of Los
Angeles, were believed to have been active bidders. But a
spokesman for San Francisco-based BankAmerica said the
premium wasn't that steep, based on the bank's own core
deposit estimate for Western of $2.1 billion, which would
indicate a purchase price equal to about 3.9% of such
deposits.
   Earlier this year, the RTC identified Western as a
candidate for quick sale. The $81 million price-tag, while a
pittance for a healthy large institution, is one of the RTC's
biggest deals in months. In February, for instance, it sold
Bright Banc Savings Association of Dallas to Banc One Corp.,
Columbus, Ohio, for $45 million, a price equal to about 2.1%
of core deposits, or about half the rate that BankAmerica is
paying.
   In October, NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., acquired from
the government Tampa, Fla.-based Freedom Savings &amp; Loan
Association for $40.4 million and University Savings
Association of Houston for $129 million.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, BankAmerica shares closed at $30.625, unchanged.
