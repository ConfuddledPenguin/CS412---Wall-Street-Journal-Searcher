   Corona Corp. said it requested that a trading halt in its
stock remain in effect until Monday, when it will make a
"material" announcement. Analysts expect the Toronto company
will announce a sweetened offer to increase its interest in
the promising Eskay Creek gold deposit in northwestern
British Columbia.
   Trading also has been halted in Stikine Resources Ltd. and
Prime Resources Group Inc., joint owners of Eskay Creek.
Corona has agreed with Stikine and Prime to acquire 44.6% of
a new company to be formed from the merger of the two
Vancouver-based mineral exploration concerns. Corona owns 20%
of Prime.

   In a rival move that threatens to block Corona's plan,
Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc. offered 229.5 million
Canadian dollars (US$195.1 million), or C$67.50 a share, for
Stikine. Analysts estimate Corona's offer of a package of
securities, including Corona shares, is roughly equal in
value to the Placer bid. But Placer's offer of cash, with a
stock alternative, is viewed as the more attractive of the
two.
