   Ashland Oil Inc. was ordered to pay $10.3 million to four
people who claimed that discharge from the company's
Catlettsburg, Ky., oil refinery hurt the quality of their
lives.
   The verdict by a Kanawha County court jury in Charleston,
W.Va., could be a major blow to the company because it was
the first of what is expected to be many trials involving
nearly 300 plaintiffs. The cases are expected to involve five
plaintiffs at a time.

   The plaintiffs are also seeking damages to pay for health
monitoring costs.
   The Ashland, Ky., oil refiner said it plans to appeal to
the West Virginia Supreme Court.
   Debra L. Hamilton, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys with
the Charleston law firm De Trapano &amp; Jackson, said the case
was unusual because it relied mostly on the testimony of
residents affected by the discharge, which consisted of oily
droplets and white flakey fallout. "Most of these cases boil
down to battles of experts, but this one was told through the
eyes of the residents and inspectors who had to respond to
the complaints," she said.
   The four plaintiffs, ranging in age from 19 to 57, told
jurors that the pollution was foul-smelling, burned their
eyes and throats and caused skin rashes. Some said pollution
damaged automobile paint, aluminum siding and window glass in
mobile homes. Each of the plaintiffs was awarded actual
damages ranging from $320,000 to $350,000 and punitive
damages ranging from $2 million to $2.5 million.
   In the trial, plaintiffs' attorney R. Rodney Jackson
pretended to pour drain cleaner over a three-dimensional map
of the area around the refinery. Referring to Ashland
chairman John R. Hall, Mr. Jackson said, "Here you go, Mr.
Hall, how about a little of that on your house, a little bit
of Drano. Let's see if you'd like to eat this, Mr. Hall."
   Ashland attorneys declined comment. In a statement, the
company said, "Ashland believes numerous errors were made
during the course of the trial which prejudiced Ashland's
ability to defend itself. We believe the jury's verdict was
erroneous and the award was ridiculous."
   An Ashland spokesman contended that Ashland was prevented
from calling as an expert witness a former director of the
Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   The spokesman said the refinery is in compliance with
clean air standards and that monitors around the community
show the air quality to be good.

   KANSAS SUPREME COURT limits legal rights of fetus.
   Ruling on a medical malpractice claim, the court held that
a nonviable fetus isn't a "person" under Kansas law and its
parents are barred from bringing a wrongful death damage suit
on its behalf.
   Courts have been struggling in recent years to define the
rights of unborn children to bring civil damage suits. Many
state courts have permitted negligence actions to be brought
on behalf of a viable fetus, one capable of living outside
its mother's womb. But courts have been deciding both ways in
cases where the fetus isn't considered capable of independent
life.
   The Kansas decision "is supported by some states and not
by others," says Dennis Prater, a litigation specialist at
the University of Kansas law school.
   The case was brought by Brenda and Bennie Humes of
Lawrence, Kan., against Dr. Dale Clinton, a local physician.
He had inserted an intrauterine contraceptive device into Ms.
Humes in June 1985, but she became pregnant 14 months later.
She had an abortion after another doctor said continuing the
pregnancy would threaten her life. The fetus was 16 1/2 weeks
old at the time.
   In their suit against Dr. Clinton, the Humes included a
wrongful death claim on behalf of their unborn child. The
trial judge refused to dismiss the claim, but the Kansas
Supreme Court said it was barred by the state's wrongful
death statute.
   "A nonviable fetus is not a distinct entity; rather its
life is an integral part of its mother's life," the court
declared. "Therefore, we find viability an appropriate
condition precedent to liability for wrongful death" under
Kansas law.
   Big awards are at stake in negligence cases against
companies and doctors. If suits on behalf of all fetuses are
authorized, "every pregnant woman who miscarries would have a
potential cause of action," asserts Thomas E. Wright, an
attorney for Davis Wright, Unrein, Hummer &amp; McCallister in
Topeka, counsel for Dr. Clinton.
   John W. McClelland of Wirken &amp; King in Kansas City, Mo.,
counsel for the Humes, says the Kansas Supreme Court has
created an "artificial distinction between what is and is not
a living being."

   THREE STATES CHALLENGE new Super fund regulations.
   Pennsylvania, New York and Colorado filed petitions for
review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, claiming that the new regulations may lead to
inadequate cleanup of hazardous waste sites, unfair release
of responsible parties from liability and the shifting of
clean-up costs to the states.
   New York cited a pollution abatement plant in Oswego that
was cleaned up by the EPA and then turned over to the state
to operate. New York claims the new EPA regulations make the
state responsible for the full cost, while the Superfund law
requires the state to pay only 10%. The Federal government
and the polluters are responsible for the rest, under the
1986 law.
   Pennsylvania and Colorado contend the new rules are too
vague and could permit admitted polluters like Texas Eastern
Transmission Corp., which buried toxic PCPs in parts of
Pennsylvania, to escape clean-up altogether.
   In the petitions, the three states are asking the court to
beef up the new EPA regulations to make them consistent with
1986 amendments to the federal Superfund law. Earl Salo, an
EPA assistant general counsel, declined to comment until the
EPA reviews the complaints.
   Several states are also expected to contest the new
regulations, said a spokesman for Pennsylvania's Department
of Environmental Resources.

   KEITH HARING ESTATE sues Playboy for copyright
infringement.
   In a suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the estate
of the late pop artist accused Playboy Enterprises Ltd. of
reproducing and selling "Bunny" drawings without approval.
Mr. Haring, who died Feb. 16 at the age of 32, drew the bunny
pictures -- which incorporate a bunny head shaped like the
Playboy emblem -- in 1986. The suit said that Mr. Haring sold
Playboy the right to use one of the drawings on the
magazine's January 1987 cover for $5,000. But the suit said
Mr. Haring didn't authorize any other use of the drawings by
Playboy.
   According to the suit, Playboy has arranged for the
drawings to be reproduced as silk screens and sold for $200 a
piece. The suit also names as defendants Special Editions, a
Playboy subsidiary, and American Portfolio, both based in
Parlin, N.J. The suit accused Playboy of claiming to have
ownership rights to the drawings and improperly authorizing
the two New Jersey firms to reproduce them.
   A Playboy spokeswoman said the company commissioned Mr.
Haring to do the drawings as "work for hire." She said that
under the arrangement, the company owns all rights to the
works. The New Jersey firms declined to comment.
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, also accuses
Playboy of illegally using the Haring signature and logo to
market the reproductions. The suit asked that the defendants
be ordered to retrieve all copies of the "Bunny" drawings
sold to customers and that all revenue from the sales be held
in escrow.
   Peter Stern, an attorney with the New York law firm of
Berger &amp; Steingut, which represents the Haring estate, said
"the estate is concerned about the impact this wave of
unauthorized paper will have on Haring's legacy and on the
value of his actual work."

early 1987.

   IMELDA MARCOS'S TRIAL was temporarily halted after she
collapsed.
   Mrs. Marcos, on trial for allegedly stealing $200 million

her attorneys said. An ambulance took her to the New York
Hospital emergency room.
   Judge John Keenan, in federal court in Manhattan,
instructed the jurors in the case to return to court at noon
Tuesday.
   Mrs. Marcos has hypertension and her blood pressure is
monitored by a device she wears during the trial.
