   Asset Investors Corp., a Denver-based real estate
investment trust, said it renewed its bank loan agreement
with First Bank of Minneapolis, reducing its credit line to a
maximum of $30 million from $60 million.
   The unit of First Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis said
that it will be allowed to borrow as much as $30 million but
this amount will decline by $5 million each quarter, and that
the agreement will mature next May 31. The previous agreement
expired yesterday.
