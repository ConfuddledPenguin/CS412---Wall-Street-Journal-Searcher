   We thought the most fascinating part of Mikhail
Gorbachev's itinerary would be his trip to the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. Alas, Mr. Gorbachev
has canceled this stop on his trip, substituting a 30-minute
chat with some Hoover scholars along with other Stanford
professors and students.
   The Hoover visit would have been an apt gesture, if only
because founder Herbert Hoover's best work was directing the
American Relief Administration in the Soviet Union after
World War I. He helped reconstruct the Russian economy, and
it would be perfectly appropriate for Mr. Gorbachev to tour
the unique Soviet memorabilia in Hoover's archives, and to
express his nation's appreciation for Mr. Hoover's
generosity.

   Also, of course, he could get a lot of useful advice on
his economic problems, from people who were onto the flaws of
the Soviet system while glasnost and perestroika were but
gleams in his eye. Even Mr. Gorbachev might learn something,
for example, from Hoover Fellow Judy Shelton, author of the
1989 book, "The Coming Soviet Crash." Milton Friedman is
always both instructive and entertaining, former Secretary of
State George Shultz has the benefit of vast experience, and
various other Hoover scholars have been working the details
of Soviet economic reform.
   The reasons for Mr. Gorbachev's cancellation remain hazy,
but perhaps he's had a crash course in the intrigues of
American academic politics. Back in 1961, Mr. Hoover wrote
that the "left-wing faculty in Stanford University is
constantly conspiring to get control of the Hoover
Institution." And it seems that in the eyes of the Stanford
faculty Mr. Gorbachev's agreement to visit Hoover put him in
a class with Benedict Arnold.
   "Dear Mr. President," political science Professor John
Manley wrote in a public letter to Mr. Gorbachev last week,
"Please know that the Hoover Institution, whose mission was
defined by Herbert Hoover as `exposing the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx,' is using your visit to Stanford to
discredit socialism, and to make it appear that, with
socialism's failure, you are coming to them for advice."
   Mr. Manley warned that they will "laugh at you, socialism,
and the Soviet Union." Worse yet, "They will also score a
victory over those of us at Stanford who have fought for
years to sever connections between the university and the
conservative think tank.
   "It would help greatly if you were to denounce Hoover's
cynical manipulation of your visit here," Mr. Manley pleaded.
"I and other dissenters at Stanford will not be invited to
any of the private events." Whatever Mr. Gorbachev may have
concluded about the merits of this, he's a good enough
politician to recognize he has little to win by stepping into
snake pits.
   Mr. Manley speaks for the same Stanford that two years ago
decided that in drawing a curriculum there was no special
value to the ideas -- individual worth and responsibility,
for example -- that now energize Eastern Europe. At Stanford
and elsewhere, the academic mind-set continues to reflect the
Vietnam-era mentality of America as pillager of the world.
Yet Eastern Europe and even Russia itself are now striving to
emulate the American economy and join Western culture.
   History is rapidly disproving this liberal academic
mind-set. Liberal academics, protected by tenure, will be the
last to know. They certainly will not honor the likes of the
Hoover scholars for being right, for this would admit their
own errors. Long after the Cold War is truly gone from
East-West relations, it will linger in the groves of our
prestige campuses.
