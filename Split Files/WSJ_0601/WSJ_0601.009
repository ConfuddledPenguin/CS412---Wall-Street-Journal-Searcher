   OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1% in
March as a result of an increase in output of goods-producing
industries, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The increase followed a 0.1% gain in February and a 0.1%
decline in January. In the first quarter, the figure rose
0.2%. It reflects the total value of the country's output of
goods and services.

   In March, output of goods rose 0.2% partly because of a
pickup in the production of autos and auto parts. Output of
the services industry remained unchanged.
   Separately, the Canadian Conference Board reported that
its index of business confidence fell in the first quarter to
its lowest level since 1983. The board's survey was conducted
in mid-March.
