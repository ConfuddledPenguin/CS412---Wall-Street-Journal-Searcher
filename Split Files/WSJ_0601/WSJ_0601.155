"out-of-stock" inventory position, reported sharply larger

   Sales in the latest period dropped slightly to $130.1
million from $131.7 million the year earlier.
Comparable-stores sales dropped 7% in the latest quarter.
   The company said it improved its inventory "in-stock"
levels and had a same-store sales gain in April.
   Recently, the company announced that it had retained
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., S.G. Warburg &amp;
Co. and Argosy Group "to explore its financial and strategic
alternatives including the possible sale of the company."
   Previously, it was reported that CNC Holding Corp., owner
of about 82% of the company's stock, and Child World were
considering the sale of all or part of CNC's interest in
Child World. CNC Holding is a private investment group in
Cleveland.
   Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, Child
World common closed at $10.375, off 62.5 cents.
