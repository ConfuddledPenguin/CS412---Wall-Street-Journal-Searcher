   WASHINGTON -- Despite the expected completion this week of
a long-awaited U.S.-Soviet chemical-weapons treaty, it will
be many years before the superpowers are able to safely
destroy their vast inventories of poison gas.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev are
expected to sign the pact with considerable fanfare today,
even though neither country has put into operation a
full-scale plant able to eliminate thousands of tons of toxic
mustard gas, rockets filled with nerve agents or other deadly
chemical arms. Both Washington and Moscow have found
developing new technology and starting up such disposal
plants to be substantially more difficult, time-consuming and
expensive than they anticipated.

   The expected agreement would end chemical-weapons
production by both superpowers and set a timetable for
destroying most stocks of poison gas over 12 years. The
Soviets are believed to have 50,000 tons of poison gas; the
U.S. has about 30,000 tons, including 500,000 rockets filled
with nerve gas and other 1960-era weapons.
   The first U.S. disposal facility, a $240-million
incinerator built on tiny Johnston Island in the middle of
the Pacific, is months behind schedule. Beset by contractor
problems, computer glitches and a string of broken promises
to Congress about when operations would begin, the plant
still doesn't have all the necessary environmental and safety
approvals. Once operational tests do start, probably in the
next few weeks, it will take more than a year to begin
routine operation.
   In the Soviet Union, the outlook is bleaker. Public
concern over potential health hazards has blocked operation
of the Kremlin's solitary chemical-weapons disposal plant in
Chapayevsk, south of Moscow. "At the moment, the Russians
simply have no existing technology to comply" with provisions
in the agreement to begin disposal efforts by 1992, says
Elisa Harris, a chemical-arms expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
   Soviet officials will depend on the Defense Department and
American scientists for technical help; a high-level
delegation of Soviet army chemical-warfare experts is
scheduled to arrive in Moscow barely five days after the
summit ends.
   "We don't yet have a destruction program," Sergei
Batsanov, the top Soviet chemical-arms negotiator,
acknowledged to reporters in Geneva during a break in the
talks in April. "We look to our American counterparts in this
respect."
   Then there is the question of cost. The Pentagon, which
has spent $1.1 billion in the past five years to protect and
plan for the eventual destruction of the aging U.S.
stockpile, wants an additional $430 million this year.
Raytheon Co. and Bechtel Group Inc. already have large
engineering contracts; they consider chemical-weapons
destruction a major growth area.
   But environmental groups and congressional critics are
bound to oppose the latest budget request. They say the
military hasn't provided all the safeguards and information
it promised.
   And it's still going to cost an estimated $3 billion to
build, operate and arrange for Soviet inspection of eight
additional disposal facilities planned for the U.S. by the
late 1990s. The Pentagon already is 18 months behind its
original timetable for carrying out that master plan -- and
four years behind the schedule many in Congress hoped it
would achieve.
   The Johnston Island facility, for all its sophisticated
metal-shearing machinery, explosion-resistant bunkers and a
remote-controlled incinerator designed to burn toxic
chemicals at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, is slated to destroy
only about 6% of the Pentagon's chemical-weapons arsenal.
Even its staunchest supporters concede that the
first-of-its-kind plant, operated by a unit of Raytheon, has
a troubled history.
   "We had equipment problems and we had software problems,"
says Army Col. Eric Azuma, a top program manager. Raytheon
and the Army are still working out the details of emergency
procedures. Start-up will begin very slowly and cautiously,
Col. Azuma says, because "if we have a small hiccup at the
plant, it's going to be known" by the whole world.
   Progress at Johnston Island is likely to play an important
role in U.S.-West German relations. The Bush administration
has promised that by July, it will start removing from West
Germany some 100,000 artillery shells filled with deadly
nerve gas. Those weapons are supposed to go to the
mid-Pacific island for destruction.
   Packed in 5,000 airtight steel containers, the shells will
be trucked by a secret route to Miesau, West Germany, put on
a closely guarded train and then placed in the holds of
specially outfitted U.S. vessels for the long ocean voyage.
The elaborate plan includes decoy trucks to fool terrorists,
as well as a U.S. Navy escort at sea. Delays in removing the
chemical weapons would be a political blow to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who faces intense domestic pressure to get the
shells off West German soil.
   But many other governments around the world also are
keenly interested in the fate of the Johnston Island plant.
If an international agreement outlawing chemical arms is
finished in the next few years, "there are a dozen or so
other countries that will face problems in destroying their
stocks," predicts Brookings' Ms. Harris.
