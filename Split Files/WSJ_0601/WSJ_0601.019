   In Paul A. Gigot's May 11 Potomac Watch column, "The
President Sniffs Out a Budget Deal," he wrote of the belly
laughs that talk of a line-item veto and other significant
budget reforms invokes inside the Washington Beltway. Well,
I'm holding my stomach after reading Mr. Gigot's column, not
from laughter, but from that sinking feeling one gets when he
realizes disaster has just about hit. When so astute an
observer as Mr. Gigot is tempted to give serious credence to
the seductive offer of deals by the big spenders and taxers,
one has to worry that the Washington virus of wishful
thinking has reached epidemic proportions. The budget
"reforms" now dangled before the president are nothing more
than fig leafs offered to a man being asked to humiliate
himself.
   None of the big spenders and taxers are talking about true
budget reform such as constitutional line-item-veto authority
and a balanced-budget/tax-limitation constitutional
amendment. (If the president is serious about wanting a
line-item veto, why doesn't he go ahead and exercise the
line-item-veto authority he professes to believe the
Constitution already grants the president?)

   None of the taxers and spenders are talking about
returning the Social Security surplus to taxpayers -- to end
the current dishonest practice of diverting Social Security
taxes to pay for general government spending -- and extending
Gramm-Rudman through 1999 to make up the lost revenues by
restraining spending growth. All we see so far are flimsy
proposals to enhance presidential rescission authority with a
simple majority-rule congressional override provision and
dangerous balanced-budget requirements with impotent "tax
notification" provisions that would increase the
already-substantial bias toward raising taxes.
   The administration is playing a very dangerous game by
tantalizing Congress with the suggestion that it is willing
to trade large tax increases for budget-process reform.
Bush's boys easily could blunder into a situation when they
trap the president into a corner and he is forced to trade
off tax increases against superficial budget-process reform.
Then we can all hold our noses with one hand as we sniff the
deal and hold our stomachs with the other hand, and, again,
it won't be from laughter.
