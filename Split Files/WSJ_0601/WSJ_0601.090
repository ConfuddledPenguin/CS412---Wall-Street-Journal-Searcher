   The commercial real estate market, overbuilt in all
segments during the 1980s, will remain in a recession for the
next five years, according to a survey of 400 real estate
executives.
   The survey results, to be released Monday by the
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, paint a particularly
pessimistic picture of office developments and investment
returns in the New York market.

   Nationwide, office rents are expected to rise just 2.2% to
2.4% during the first half of the 1990s, in contrast to a
projected inflation rate of about 4.8%.
   "Office {investment} has been the worst-performing sector
for the past two years, and it looks like that's going to
continue to be the worst-performing sector for the next five
years," said Michael L. Evans, national director of Ernst &amp;
Young Real Estate Advisory Services.
   The real estate executives surveyed by Ernst &amp; Young
earlier this year were asked to assess the future markets for
office, warehouse, retail and apartment developments. The
majority of the respondents said value appreciation in all
four categories will lag behind the projected inflation rate,
although apartments and warehouses will come closest to
matching it with projected rent appreciations of 4.5% and
4.1%, respectively.
   Mr. Evans, who led the analysis of the survey results,
said he was struck most by the respondents' negative
assessment of the New York City market and their optimism
about markets in the Southwest, particularly Houston and
Dallas.
   "Clearly Manhattan is at the bottom of the list," he said.
"New York could have some very significant problems."
   Almost one-third of the survey respondents, or 28.6%,
ranked New York as the most overvalued market, followed by
Los Angeles, at 13.8%.
   Houston and Dallas led the list of cities with the most
potential for real estate investment, with positive
assessments by 9.3% and 8.9%, respectively, of the
respondents.
   "It is confirmed that Houston and Dallas are coming back,"
Mr. Evans said. "It's not bottom-fishing. The economics are
there. There was an indication {in the survey} that Houston
and Dallas have reached the place where rents justify the
investment."
