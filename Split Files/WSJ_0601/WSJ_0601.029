   It may be sweet music to Judy Hawkins's ears, but to
teen-agers who use her 7-Eleven store in downtown Victoria,
British Columbia, as a meeting place, the music that blares
through outdoor speakers is twisted, sister.
   "I try not to pay attention to it," says 16-year-old John
Ark, hanging out in front of the store. Adds friend Paul
Upjohn, 18: "It's like standing in an elevator. It makes me
feel like kicking in the windows." Shelly Lang, 16, says, "A
lot of kids bring ghetto blasters" to try and drown it out.

   The scathing music reviews suit Ms. Hawkins just fine.
Hers is one of 10 7-Eleven convenience stores in British
Columbia that use tunes teens find offensive to keep them
from loitering nearby, plugging up parking lots and scaring
off potential customers.
   The programmed music, which the store buys monthly from a
local distributor, goes by the name the Golden Sound. It's
heavy on light, meandering instrumentals by artists such as
Ray Conniff and Mantovani.
   "It's all the music that kids hate, stuff like `Moon
River,' " says Tom Wolnicki, a 7-Eleven supervisor who helped
Ms. Hawkins install her sound system in April.
   Ms. Hawkins says the bad vibes quickly vexed the
loiterers. "The after-school crowd {used to be} anywhere from
15 to 20 kids" who would loiter outside her store, slurping
Slurpees or crunching candy. "Now, it's just five or six" who
can stomach the music. And they don't linger long.
   "When I see half a dozen kids gathering, that's when my
antennae turn up," along with the sound volume, says Ms.
Hawkins. But "it's not as if, boom, they're gone. It usually
takes three or four minutes" for the noxious notes to do
their work.
   A spokeswoman at the Dallas headquarters of Southland
Corp., 7-Eleven's parent, says the 7,000-store chain is "real
excited" about using the anti-loitering scheme elsewhere. To
date, she says, it's being used only by the 7-Eleven stores
in British Columbia. "Maybe we could even elevate it to
orchestra or chamber music," the spokeswoman adds.
   Jerry Reske, vice president of Pacific Sound Inc. in
Seattle, which sells the Golden Sound in the Northwest, says
he isn't surprised by its use as teen repellent. People like
different kinds of music, he says, and "for teen-agers, it's
a downer. . . . I've done programming to {drive teens away
from} a number of carwashes."
