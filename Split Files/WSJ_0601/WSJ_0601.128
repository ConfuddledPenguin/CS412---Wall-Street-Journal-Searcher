   Rioting that disrupted oil output in recent days from the
tiny OPEC nation of Gabon has caused some ripple effects on
U.S. refiners who import West African crudes.
   The interruption in production has had little impact on
world oil markets because Gabon is the smallest producer in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with
recent output of only about 260,000 barrels a day. Output
also appears to be slowly resuming.

   But the disruption is being felt by three major oil
companies that account for the bulk of Gabon's production:
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group
and Amoco Corp. Gabon's crude is particularly attractive
because it yields more gasoline per barrel than some other
world crudes.
   Industry sources said the most significant impact has been
on the French state-controlled Elf group, which had been
producing about 101,000 barrels a day in Gabon, a former
French colony.
   Last weekend, Elf confirmed it had cut output and
withdrawn many employees because of the civil unrest and
violence in the province of Ogooue Maritime and its capital
Port Gentil, Gabon's main port. Some oil-company employees,
including several from Elf, were held hostage there for a
while.
   Elf didn't fully shut down in Gabon because its facilities
must be kept at minimal operating levels to prevent clogging
of pipelines by the waxy, high paraffin-content crudes. Since
then, Elf said its Gabon unit has resumed production, and
Loik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's president, told Paris analysts
that the interruption of production in Gabon shouldn't have
any noticeable effect on 1990 results.
   Elf's resumption of output followed an ultimatum by Gabon
president Omar Bongo that the oil company return to full
production or have its operations turned over to other
companies.
   It isn't clear when oil loadings from Port Gentil will be
back to normal. But earlier this week Elf's president said
that the company's output would be restored to normal in 48
to 72 hours. Also, according to Dow Jones International
Petroleum Report, buyers of Gabonese crude from the Shell
group, which operates the large Rabi-Kounga field, said they
had been told cargoes scheduled to load in early June from
Gamba, the second-largest oil port, would be delayed by only
one day.
   The Shell group had evacuated non-essential staff and
families of expatriates from Gabon last weekend. But the
group reported a majority of its expatriate employees, about
130, remained in Gabon. Still, according to some reports,
total oil output in Gabon fell as low as 50,000 barrels a
day.
   Although average Gabonese output for May probably topped
the country's official OPEC quota of 197,000 barrels a day,
the Oil Daily's Energy Compass estimated that physical
production losses are approaching a total of one million
barrels.
   "A drop in the ocean as far as world oil supplies are
concerned, the disruption to oil output and exports from
riot-torn Gabon could, nonetheless, make some small impact on
the relatively tight market in light West African crudes
which are mostly destined for the U.S.," the London-based
publication reported.
