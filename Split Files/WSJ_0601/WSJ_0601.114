   SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp., a maker of motors and
electro-optical instruments, appears to have won a proxy
fight for control of the board waged by hostile suitor
Vernitron Corp.
   But Vernitron said that Kollmorgen won the fight only
because of the votes from some convertible preferred stock
Kollmorgen sold to an investor group in March. The vote was
held yesterday at the annual meeting.

   Vernitron's chairman and chief executive officer, Stephen
Bershad, has said the company would drop the battle if it
lost the proxy fight. But Mr. Bershad said yesterday that
Vernitron is "evaluating all (its) options," and will
continue the litigation pending between the two companies.
   Vernitron, a closely held Deer Park, N.Y., manufacturer of
motors and controls, that has pursued Kollmorgen for 17
months, now holds 6% of that company.
   At one point, the companies had a definitive agreement
under which Vernitron would pay $25 a share, or $320 million,
for Kollmorgen. Vernitron withdrew from the transaction a
week before it was to close, citing "adverse changes" in
Kollmorgen that it didn't expect. The transaction's collapse
led the companies to sue each other. Since then, Kollmorgen
has announced it would restructure, a move that includes
sales of assets.
   Most recently, Vernitron proposed to buy the 94% it
doesn't own of the now-smaller Kollmorgen. Vernitron said it
would pay $15 a share in cash, or in a unit consisting of one
common share of the merged Kollmorgen-Vernitron plus a share
of the proceeds from a sale of Kollmorgen's electro-optical
business. Vernitron would pay cash for as much as 50% of the
shares on a pro-rata basis.
   "The fact is that the majority of the common shareholders
appear to have voted for at least four of our directors," Mr.
Bershad said. "If you take out the preferred and the shares
owned by (Kollmorgen) management and their families, then
they didn't get many votes at all. And for them to consider
that an endorsement of any of their policies is to
misconstrue the facts."
   John Youngblood, Kollmorgen's chairman and chief
executive, said that the company is pleased that shareholders
"have spoken so clearly and decisively." He added that
Kollmorgen is "confident that without the continued
disruption of Vernitron's activities," the company's
restructuring will benefit all shareholders.
   Mr. Bershad said, "I would like to see some form of
combination. Whether that's possible, I don't know."
   Final results of the balloting will be available in about
a week.
