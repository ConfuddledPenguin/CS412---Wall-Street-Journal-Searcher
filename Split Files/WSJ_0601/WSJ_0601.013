   ATLANTA -- Goodbye "MagiCans."
   Only three weeks after launching the biggest advertising
campaign in its history, Coca-Cola Co. is abandoning the core
of its $100 million summer promotion. The much-hyped
MagiCans, which resemble regular cans of Coca-Cola Classic
but actually contain money and certificates for prizes, were
tarnished by malfunctions.

   But more damaging than the cans' defects, according to
industry executives, was the incessant bad publicity that
seemed to surround the promotion.
   "There was too much negative press," says one industry
executive familiar with the campaign. Coke, he adds, "decided
let's just end this before the press got any worse." However,
a Coca-Cola spokesman says, "We felt winding down the program
was appropriate because we didn't want any consumers to be
concerned about any Coke promotion."
   Last night, Coke was scheduled to begin running ads that
say: "The last MagiCans are out there, but not for long. So
look for MagiCans today, because now you see them, soon you
won't."
   Abandoning MagiCans is a blow to Coca-Cola's image as a
premier marketer. Enamored of the technical gimmickry that
delivered scrolled money from inside a can, Coke spent more
than two years developing the technology. It had even
test-marketed the cans in Iowa and Illinois cities last fall.
   But with a growing number of reports that prize-delivery
mechanisms were broken -- and that one boy in Massachusetts
had drunk some foul-smelling water from one of the cans --
the company now may be left with more than 500,000 MagiCans
on its hands and potential problems with the prizes inside.
   Original plans called for the distribution of 750,000
MagiCans through Aug. 15, according to the official game
rules made available in grocery stores. A Coke spokesman says
"hundreds of thousands of cans" are already in the market.
The cans, according to the new ads, will be "going, going,
gone by mid-June." One industry executive says the promotion
will end with about 200,000 cans actually distributed.
   The official rules, however, specify exact numbers of
prizes to be won. For example, the promotion was supposed to
make 25 cans available with $500 bills inside, the rules say,
and 560,050 cans with $5 bills. Now, Coke officials are
huddling to figure out what the legal ramifications are,
according to the industry executive. Says Coke's spokesman:
"We've made no decision on what we'll do with those prizes."
   Supposed to be a flashy, no-hitches promotion, MagiCans
have become a major preoccupation at Coke headquarters here.
As reports of the malfunctions grew -- some 70 consumers have
called Coke to complain -- concerned officials began doing
consumer research to determine to what extent the brand's
image was damaged. And work on other marketing projects was
sidetracked as top Coke officials wrestled with problems with
MagiCans.
   The MagiCans were the heart of the summer promotion for
Coke's flagship brand. The campaign also includes commercials
with the vocal group New Kids on the Block and giveaways such
as cups that feature peel-off stickers with prizes
underneath. While the MagiCans will disappear, Coke still
plans to continue with the remainder of the Classic
promotion.
   In recent days, Coke has tried to salvage the MagiCan
campaign. Research had indicated that many consumers --
despite the mechanical problems -- still took a fancy to the
cans. Moreover, the promotion was boosting sales.
Nonetheless, Coke began a series of full-page newspaper ads
warning people about the faulty mechanisms. Advising
consumers to "take a good look" at the MagiCans, the ads
described the difference between a broken prize device and a
working one.
   The ads also instructed people not to drink from a
MagiCan, which contains water instead of Coke to give the can
the feel of the real thing. Health officials who tested some
of the water found that it wasn't harmful, but Coke still
could face potential liabilities from any consumers who
accidentally ingested it.
   Says Coke's spokesman: "Given that there are no health or
safety issues involved here, legal considerations played no
part in our decision."
