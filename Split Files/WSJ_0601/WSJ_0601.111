   WASHINGTON -- Arkady Maslennikov, the new Soviet
presidential spokesman, arrived 20 minutes late for his first
summit news briefing here, armed with an excuse that he
thought the international press corps would appreciate.
   "The road to hell is paved with good intentions," he said
in heavily accented but fluent English. "I was trying to get
more information to be more specific than my counterpart"
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who had already begun
the joint briefing. Mr. Maslennikov paused and added: "I
overheard him on radio, and actually I have almost nothing to
add."

   The 58-year-old former Pravda reporter whom Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev plucked from relative obscurity
last April has the same ready humor that made his
predecessor, Gennadi Gerasimov, a familiar and likable figure
to the U.S. public. But Mr. Maslennikov, in his American
media debut, made clear that he will be a more cautious
spokesman.
   U.S. officials say that on occasion Mr. Gerasimov,
currently the Foreign Ministry spokesman, had a tendency to
state policy positions on his own, without first checking
with superiors. Sometimes these assertions proved to be off
base. Mr. Maslennikov doesn't get out in front of his boss.
Asked yesterday if Mr. Gorbachev arrived in Washington with
new proposals on the vexing issue of German unification, Mr.
Maslennikov said: "It's better to have a kind of suspension .
. . and wait until they start discussing the problem." And
when asked to respond to comments by President Bush about
Lithuania, the Soviet spokesman said: "Probably you want to
hear our president's reaction."
   Mr. Maslennikov, who was educated as an economist, met his
new boss in 1984 when Mr. Gorbachev, then the secretary of
the Communist Party's Central Committee, was on an official
visit to London. The trip produced rave reviews in the
international press for Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Maslennikov, who
then was based in London for Pravda, had a reputation there
for having extremely close ties to leftist British unions and
for occasionally writing anti-American diatribes.
   But times have changed, and so, apparently, has Mr.
Maslennikov. Now, friends say, he is plugged into Mr.
Gorbachev's new thinking. "He likes Chinese food and
pro-American policies," says Tomas Kolesnechenko, Pravda's
Moscow-based political correspondent, who is in Washington
covering the superpower summit.
   Mr. Maslennikov displayed some of that thinking yesterday
when he noted that the Soviet Union "had several decades of
attempts to impose somebody's conception, somebody's will, on
another. And we have now heaps of weapons we don't know what
to do with."
   Mr. Maslennikov's appointment caught foreign journalists
in Moscow by surprise -- an announcement was released by the
Soviet news agency Tass inviting reporters to a briefing by
"Presidential press secretary A. Maslennikov." Mr.
Maslennikov may have been saving his wit for an American
audience. In Moscow, some journalists find his briefings
interesting, but he is seen as a gray bureaucrat.
   Some Americans, though, prefer this all-business style to
the cavalier attitude often displayed by Mr. Gerasimov.
During a meeting last December, "I found him to be highly
efficient, quite approachable and lacking the arrogance one
had encountered in the previous Soviet spokesman," Jerry
Strober, spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, says of the new spokesman.
   Mr. Strober says that during a conversation, Mr.
Maslennikov bluntly predicted that once Moscow passes an
emigration bill, more than four million Soviets would apply
to leave the Soviet Union.
   Mr. Maslennikov, meanwhile, seems pleased with his initial
encounter with the U.S. press. "It was very good, very
lively," he said. "I'm delighted to hear so many questions
that express a desire to go into such detail."
