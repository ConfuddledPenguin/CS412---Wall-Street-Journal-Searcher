   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.'s long-awaited sale of its Hay Group
unit finally appears imminent -- at a price far below what it
once hoped to fetch for the consulting company.
   People close to Hay confirmed that a management buy-out of
the Philadelphia-based firm that specializes in compensation,
employee benefits and human resources planning would be
announced as early as next week. The price is expected to
range between $85 million and $95 million.

   Although such a management buy-out has been rumored
repeatedly over the past few months, an executive familiar
with Saatchi's plans said negotiations were finished and all
that remained was for Hay to complete financing and legal
details. Both Saatchi and Hay declined to comment.
   The sale of Hay to its own managers would nearly complete
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's withdrawal from the world of management
consulting, a field it once vowed it would dominate. What's
more, even in retreat, the troubled British advertising giant
fell short of its own expectations.
   The company last June told analysts it hoped to bring in
between $393 million and $550 million from the sale of its
stable of a dozen or so consulting businesses. But, including
the Hay sale, Saatchi's major consulting companies have
brought only about $132 million: Saatchi late last year sold
its interest in its Information Consulting Group unit to
McKinsey &amp; Co. for $12 million, while the sale of a small
consulting company in France, one in Britain and of Cleveland
Consulting Associates in the U.S. fetched $25 million total.
Of major units, only Gartner Group, a company smaller than
Hay, remains unsold.
   The executive familiar with Saatchi's situation said
Saatchi had been discussing continuing to hold a mortgage of
about 20% of the Hay purchase price, and that it was
understood that a third, British investor, might assume an
equity position in Hay.
   One analyst said a final sale would be positive for all
concerned. "This whole episode is best closed," said Alan
Gottelsman, an analyst with PaineWebber. "This should have
happened a year ago."
   A person close to Hay suggested that following the buy-out
Hay would revert to its pre-Saatchi structure of ownership by
about 120 key principals. Hay has about 1,000 employees in
the U.S.
   The buy-out will leave Hay's managers with a big task. Hay
"has really suffered over the past two years," says David
Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, an industry
publication, which ranks Hay 18th among U.S. consulting
companies. The publication estimates Hay's 1989 revenue at
$210 million, about flat from the year earlier.
   While Hay doesn't disclose specific revenue figures, a
company spokesman acknowledged "relatively flat" revenue,
attributing it to "an industrywide phenomenon." Hay confirmed
that it is closing two of its 20 U.S. offices and laying off
an unspecified number of consultants. "The current cutbacks
in professional and administrative staff are part of a normal
adjustment process," the spokesman said.
