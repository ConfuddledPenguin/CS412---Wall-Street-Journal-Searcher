   NEW YORK -- Saks Fifth Avenue's prospective new owner has
spelled out plans to slash the retailer's headquarters staff
by nearly 25% -- much to the surprise of top management.
   The proposed job cuts, which would affect 270 of Saks's
1,100 corporate staffers, are disclosed in a confidential set
of projections that Investcorp International Inc. is
circulating among major international banks. At least a dozen
of those institutions are expected to join Investcorp's three
lead banks in financing the Saks acquisition.

   In April, Investcorp, a partnership of primarily Arab
investors, agreed to buy Saks from B.A.T Industries PLC for
$1.6 billion. The acquisition is expected to be completed in
early July.
   Investcorp -- which won out over a management-led bid for
Saks -- has said that it wants to keep the retailer's current
management, led by Chairman Melvin Jacobs. However, in an
interview yesterday, Mr. Jacobs said no such agreement has
been reached.
   In a separate interview, Robert Glaser, a partner at
Investcorp, insisted that "no decisions have been taken at
the present time to make any specific reductions in Saks's
staffing levels."
   Mr. Glaser said he has shared several studies of the
company with Saks's management. "We have asked them to review
these studies in detail over the next several months and to
develop management's own suggestions and program to operate
Saks under our new joint ownership," he said.
   Executives at Saks, however, expressed surprise at
learning that Investcorp may want to lay off 270 of the
staff. The 45-store chain employs about 12,000 people
nationwide.
   "I don't know what plans you are talking about," Mr.
Jacobs said. "We're in a transition stage at this time. We
will develop a business plan with Investcorp that
incorporates their objectives along with our own objectives.
That will happen over time after the actual closing of the
transaction."
   Mr. Jacobs said that while Investcorp has expressed a
desire for Saks management to stay in place, new contracts
haven't yet been signed, nor have the two sides reached
agreement on how much equity the Saks team will be allowed to
invest.
   "I'm sure Investcorp has financial plans which they've
prepared for themselves and their investors," Mr. Jacobs
said. "Those plans will have to be meshed with our business
plans, and that will be done over time. We will arrive at a
business plan that incorporates both sets of objectives."
   Paul Leblang, senior vice president of marketing at Saks,
described the Saks corporate staff as "lean." However, he
said: "There is always pressure on expenses and payroll. We
have over the years tried to be lean, but you can always
challenge or question almost anything."
   People who have seen the Investcorp projections say they
believe the cutbacks would occur over a year or two, partly
through attrition and partly by layoffs. The job losses are
expected to be centered in the credit-card and administrative
areas.
   Investcorp's bank memo also projected a business downturn
at Saks this year but rosy results afterward. It predicted
that earnings before interest, taxes and amortization will
fall to $95 million this year from $111 million in 1989 but
will surge to $147 million next year.
   Investcorp already has three lead banks committed to
provide the full $775 million that it plans to borrow --
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Chemical Banking Corp. and
Bankers Trust New York Corp. This month, the three lead banks
have begun seeking as many as 25 other banks to join them in
a syndicate that would divide up the loan more broadly.
