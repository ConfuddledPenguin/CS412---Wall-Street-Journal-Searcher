   A great cry has been raised by the contemporary art world
that the tiniest infringement of total freedom exerts a
crippling effect on an artist's creative imagination.
   It's a cry that would be silly if it weren't so rabid, as
any art historian should know that none of the titans of past
centuries -- neither Michelangelo nor Rembrandt nor El Greco
nor Shakespeare -- was ever free to insult and/or belittle
the fundamental beliefs of his church and people. Nor until
modern times did many of them even want to.

   The only significant event in the reign of England's King
John was the signing of the Magna Carta. Viewed by
Shakespeare as impairing the power of the Tudor monarchy, he
omitted it entirely from his "King John." A principle feature
of the Battle of Agincourt was the slaughter of French
prisoners and wounded by English soldiers. Shakespeare barely
hinted at it in his "Henry V." Two earth-shaking events of
14th-century England were Wat Tyler's Peasant Rebellion, when
rebels took London and beheaded the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Wycliffe's fiery theological heresies. Chaucer's
"Canterbury Tales," a supposedly all-embracing tapestry of
medieval life, mentions them nowhere.
   Yet, despite these political inhibitions, Shakespeare and
Chaucer managed to produce works generally thought to have
artistic merit. As every schoolchild should know, the female
roles in Shakespeare were played by boys, as the Elizabethans
considered it indecent for women to exhibit themselves on the
stage. So at the Globe theater Romeo had to declare his
passionate love for Juliet to a 14-year-old boy. Somehow he
managed.
   Cervantes, unlike the image of him evoked by Broadway's
"Man of La Mancha," never had a word to say against the
Spanish Inquisition. Far from a dissident spirit "dreaming
the impossible dream," he fought as a Spanish officer against
the infidel Turk at Lepanto, one of the greatest naval
battles in history. Spain's most illustrious playwright, Lope
de Vega, sailed to conquer England in no less a venture than
the Spanish Armada.
   Michelangelo, closer in temperament to some artists of
today, quarreled with his principal patron, Pope Julius II.
Considering himself a sculptor, Michelangelo had little
interest in painting, but the pope had means of inducement
and Michelangelo, under protest, relented. The result of this
tyrannical coercion was the Sistine Chapel.
   Although there had been earlier flareups (Florence's
Savonarola, who carried out the original "Bonfire of the
Vanities"), the censorial spirit made a massive entry into
the arts with Oliver Cromwell. His Puritans, considering the
theater the "devil's workshop," shut it down entirely.
(Cromwell also banned as a pagan holiday Christmas, which
somehow survived.)
   But theatrical censorship in the modern sense was
introduced in England in the 18th century by Sir Robert
Walpole, the country's first prime minister. Much nettled at
the barbed satires of a young dramatist named Henry Fielding,
Walpole endowed the Lord Chamberlain with strict powers of
censorship, both political and moral, which he retained for
some 250 years, doing no noticeable damage to the works of
Sheridan, Goldsmith, George Bernard Shaw, or Oscar Wilde.
   For his part, Henry Fielding took to the novel, wrote "Tom
Jones" and, entirely unembittered by Walpole's attack -- a
lawyer as well as a writer -- became England's first police
magistrate. A strong law-and-order man who thought the
government was indulging criminals, Fielding organized the
"Fleet Street Runners," which became London's police force.
   A sea change took place in the West's artistic communities
in the late 18th and 19th centuries, writers and artists,
beginning with the Romantics, becoming by fits and starts
"adversarial."
   But the great artistic hullabaloos in France, where in
this period the art world became firmly centered, are often
misrepresented by modern activists seeking martyrs. Although
censorship existed, the Impressionists were not condemned for
offenses to decency but, briefly, for violation of artistic
conventions -- and not by the state but by the day's art
establishment.
   What were these Impressionists doing painting ordinary,
vulgar people? In bourgeois apartments? In the open air? In
such garish colors? The brouhaha did the Impressionists far
more good than harm, and Claude Monet's ascent was such that
he became a regular Sunday dinner companion of French Premier
Georges Clemenceau. Vincent van Gogh, whose "Portrait of
Doctor Gachet" was just sold at Sotheby's for $82.5 million,
could hardly have been condemned, as almost nobody had heard
of him. In his lifetime he sold only one painting.
   As for political dissent, when painter Gustave Courbet
sided with the Communards in the abortive Paris Commune of
1871, he was brought swiftly to justice by the Third
Republic. When Jean-Louis Barrault, director of France's
national Odeon Theater, took the side of student rebels in
1968 he was as swiftly sacked by Culture Minister Andre
Malraux of the Fifth Republic.
   Attempts by America's current art establishment to obtain
absolute immunity for publicly funded "cutting edge" artworks
are doubly specious, as the cutting-edge artistic "rebellion"
of our day is in no way comparable to the past's great
stylistic upheavals. There are now, simply, no artistic
canons left against which to rebel.
   Painter Robert Rauschenberg talks of the necessity of
shock to create a "new social awareness," and Roy
Lichtenstein of "suffering the sophomoric to achieve the
sublime." But artistic rebellion today is empty, driven for
meaning to a shabby assemblage of hand-me-down radical
political cliches. As a means of achieving the sublime it is
not likely to have impressed Julius II or Lorenzo de Medici.

   Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Doctor Gachet" was
recently sold at Christie's. That information was misstated
in "Modern Artists Forget Their History," an article on
Friday's editorial page.
