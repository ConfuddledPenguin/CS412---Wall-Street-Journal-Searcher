   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Humana Inc., which owns hospitals and
operates health-benefit plans, said it will redeem on July 2
all of its 8.5% convertible subordinated debentures, due Aug.
15, 2009, at a price of $1,042.50 each, plus accrued
interest. Slightly more than $199.9 million of the debentures
are outstanding.
   The redemption will save the company about $17 million a
year in interest costs, Humana said. Assuming full
conversion, Humana said its per-share earnings won't be
affected, because the company has included the effect of
equivalent shares in its results since the debentures were
issued in 1984.
