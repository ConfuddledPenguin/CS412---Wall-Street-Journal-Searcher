   When the doors open on the Consumer Electronics Show
tomorrow morning in Chicago, the buyers and dealers that
thrive on the show's razzle-dazzle aren't likely to find much
that's really new, but they will encounter a big marketing
push for refinements of older products, and some sharp
price-cutting.
   Missing will be hot new technologies in the pipeline to
get customers spending big again. "There's no
earth-shattering something that's going to come jumping out
of the back room," says Ed Hearne, national merchandising
manager for home electronics at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.

   So the buyers who flock to Chicago -- the men and women
who decide what products make it onto store shelves this fall
-- will be looking for incremental changes and resurrected
technologies. They're getting both this weekend in such
gizmos as laser video disk players, smaller camcorders and
bigger televisions with theater-quality sound. "It's mostly
enhancements or refinements to what already exists," says
Michael Fidler, marketing vice president for Pioneer
Electronic Corp.'s U.S. home electronics unit. "The only
breakthroughs will be price breakthroughs."
   Retailers say they expect to see plummeting prices at the
show in products such as cordless telephones, cellular phones
and pocket televisions with flat screens. Facsimile machines
are expected to fall under $400, one buyer says.
   One of the show's hottest technologies, retailers say,
will be a 10-year-old product: the laser-disk player. The
machines, which play movies from 12-inch disks in the same
fashion that compact disk players spin CDs, will be a
top-billed item at several prominent booths. Panasonic Co., a
U.S. unit of the giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.,
plans to show its first laser-disk models, priced at $850 and
$1,400. Denon America Inc., a unit of Japan's Nippon Columbia
Co., says it will unveil its first laser-disk model, meant
for well-heeled videophiles.
   The technology isn't new, but big buyers are excited about
it anyway. After having languished on the market since
Pioneer introduced the first ones in 1980, the laser-disk
player is finally getting a stamp of approval now that
Panasonic has entered the market, says Donald Rothenstein,
senior merchandising manager for electronics at Sharper Image
Corp.
   "Laser disk has been in its infancy for 10 years now,"
says Mr. Rothenstein. "Now it seems to be breaking out of it.
Things are really starting to get interesting." Unit sales of
laser-disk players are expected to jump about 34%, to
215,000, this year, according to the Electronic Industries
Association, a trade group. Pioneer estimates that unit sales
will hit 250,000, and some makers think sales could go as
high as 400,000 units.
   Why such excitement over a gadget many thought was dead
several years ago? For one thing, consumer electronics
companies and retailers have so successfully saturated U.S.
homes with the old bonanza products, such as videocassette
recorders and audio equipment, that little new growth is
expected from those products.
   Laser-disk players also owe their long-awaited day in the
spotlight to the evolution of another old technology: large
screen televisions. With the color television market long
saturated, big Japanese makers are falling over each other to
stretch TV screens ever larger. Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
showed a 120-inch model at an earlier show this year, and
buyers expect even bigger screens to make their debut this
weekend, as well as cheaper models using liquid-crystal
diodes, which create a better picture with a smaller
projector.
   But videotaped movies can be grainy on the bigger screens,
and don't provide great sound either. Laser disks, which use
lasers to read digitally recorded movies, provide a much
clearer picture with compact-disk-quality sound.
   A critical mass of movies on disk has become available
this year, with over 4,000 titles on the market, retailers
say. And the price of players that can handle all five types
of laser disks -- from 3-inch and 5-inch audio disks to the
12-inch video disk -- will fall under a critical threshold
this weekend, they say. Pioneer says it will unveil at the
show a player called the CLD980 with a list price of $500;
Pioneer says it will sell at a "street price" of less than
$399, compared with the $1,000 and more that typical machines
cost last year.
   Backing up the move to laser disks are new technologies to
squeeze better sound out of movies for what the industry
calls "home theaters," essentially large-screen television
sets combined with expensive audio gear. Matsushita will show
a new system that provides theater-quality sound using THX
technology licensed from Lucasfilm Ltd. Matsushita will sell
components that seek to emulate what THX, which dictates how
audio signals are interpreted and where speakers are placed,
does in 500 theaters around the world.
   By backing laser disk, Matsushita is admitting defeat; it
backed another video-disk format in the early 1980s that
failed. But the company plans to fire up another old feud
this weekend, this one with Sony Corp. Matsushita will unveil
a tiny new 1.7-pound camcorder, a camera built into a
recorder. Called the Palmcorder, the $999-to-$1,099 gadget is
an effort by Matsushita to reverse the declining share of the
growing market for camcorders that use cassette-sized tapes
rather than the paperback-sized VHS tapes.
   That's a challenge to the king of the mountain, Sony.
Matsushita's cameras use so-called VHS-C format tapes; Sony's
rival mini-camcorders use the incompatible, 8mm format. "The
mini-camcorders wars have started up again and are heating up
rapidly," says Sharper Image's Mr. Rothenstein. "It's the
ongoing saga of those two battling it out."
   Sony and its followers are winning: 8mm camcorders had a
26% share of the $2.2 billion camcorder market last year vs.
VHS-C's 11%, according to Dealerscope Merchandising, a
consumer electronics trade journal. (The remaining 63% went
to full-sized camcorders.) Industry executives expect 8mm's
share to grow to 35% this year. Stan Baker, vice president of
video merchandising at Good Guys Inc., says about 85% of the
retailer's compact camcorder sales are 8mm machines.
   And Sony is already gloating about at least one powerful
ally who plans to join the 8mm camp at the show. Hitachi Ltd.
is expected to announce its first 8mm camera, which it will
sell alongside its VHS-C format player. "A year ago they were
saying `I'd rather sell my mother than sell 8mm,'" says Mr.
Baker. "It's a nice turnabout for Sony. Eight millimeter is
absolutely the product of choice."
   A different kind of feud, a political one between Japanese
electronics giants and U.S. recording interests, will also
still be simmering. In what has become a standing issue for
consumer shows, many makers will show digital-audio tape
players with no price tags and no firm shipping dates.
   Sony, which announced with much fanfare earlier this year
that it would start selling this summer, still hasn't firmed
up shipment dates. And despite approval earlier this week by
the Japanese government of a new standard that seeks to
prevent rampant copying, Pioneer has decided it isn't
"prudent" to show a DAT player at all, says Pioneer's Mr.
Fidler. "We're not at a point where it is totally resolved
and there are questions of viability of it in terms of
growth."
   A number of Japanese companies have scheduled news
conferences for today and Monday to announce that they plan
to start selling DAT recorders soon. Spokesmen for Matsushita
and Aiwa Co. said they would announce plans to sell the
machines in Japan, and Matsushita said it would sell
Panasonic machines in the U.S. by "late summer." A spokesman
for another major company, who asked not to be identified,
said the company today will announce plans for impending
sales in both countries.
   But the U.S. hasn't approved DAT standards, so the
introduction of the products in this country remains
uncertain. After many years of promises followed by delays,
buyers aren't optimistic that the technology will be
available in the U.S. any time soon. DAT would be an
attractive technology to boost a sagging industry, but only
"if the industry and copyright holders and the government
could get together and get it resolved," says Mr. Hearne of
Sears. "We definitely wouldn't want to get caught in the
middle."
