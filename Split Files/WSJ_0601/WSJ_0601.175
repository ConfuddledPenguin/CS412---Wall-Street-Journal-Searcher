   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department recommended that the
Federal Home Loan Bank system consider reducing the dividend
payments it makes to savings and loans because the system may
face some losses on advances to insolvent thrifts.
   Thrift industry groups immediately criticized the
suggestion, arguing that the dividend payments are important
to the struggling industry's earnings. Last year, the home
loan banks paid about $800 million to $900 million in
dividends to solvent thrifts, Martin Regalia, an economist
with the National Council of Savings Institutions estimated,
while those thrifts overall had losses of $86 million for the
year.

   "Clearly the dividends are an important contribution to
keeping the industry healthy," he said. The government is in
the process of closing and selling off hundreds of insolvent
savings and loans. To obtain advances from the home loan
banks, thrifts are required to buy stock in the banks, which,
in turn, pay dividends back to the thrifts.
   The Treasury's suggestion came in a study of
government-sponsored enterprises. Though the home loan banks
haven't lost money on an advance to any thrift, the
department said that "certain banks have exposure to failed
and failing thrifts." The study suggested reducing the
dividend payments to increase the home loan banks' capital or
for establishing a "modest" loan-loss reserve.
   A spokesman for the Federal Housing Finance Board, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development agency that
oversees the home loan bank system, said the need to increase
retained earnings has to be balanced "against the need to
maintain a market rate of return on members' invested
capital."
