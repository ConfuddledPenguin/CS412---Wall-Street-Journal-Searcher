   Still No Guarantees in Commodity Funds

   Long-term commodity funds that promise investors won't
lose money are still selling briskly, despite criticism that
people looking for above-average returns are apt to be
disappointed.
   Last year alone saw the birth of seven more so-called
"guaranteed" commodity funds, which raised $759 million from
investors.

   The funds, which are actually limited partnerships, seek
to meld the wild risks of the commodities markets with the
safety of cash-back protection: Investors who maintain their
holdings in a fund for a certain time -- usually five years
-- are assured they will at least get back their initial
investment.
   Recent versions of the funds have sought to answer
criticisms that earlier guaranteed funds used too much of
investors' money to provide the guarantee and put too little
into actually trading commodities. That, coupled with heavy
expenses and fees, made it difficult for the funds to
generate the kind of returns people usually want when they
take the plunge into commodities investing.
   But despite the improvements, guaranteed funds are still
no panacea. People who really want to play the commodities
markets might be better off putting a portion of their assets
in conventional managed futures investments, some financial
advisers say. They can minimize the risks by keeping the bulk
of their money in stocks and bonds.
   "A good investment adviser or broker can help an investor
to decide the appropriate percentage to put into managed
futures, and then help pick the best {commodity} fund or pool
available in the same way he would help an investor make
investments in stocks, bonds or real estate," says Ken
Steben, president of Steben Asset Management Inc. of
Bethesda, Md.
   There's certainly no disputing the allure of the word
"guarantee" -- especially in the world of commodities, where
some statistics show that 70% of those who invest for
themselves come out losers on an annual basis. A guarantee
increases the size of the pool of investors who will consider
an investment in the futures market, says Ken Tropin,
chairman of the Managed Futures Trade Association. But
guaranteed funds "are neither better nor worse than
nonguaranteed funds -- they are simply different," he says.
   The first guaranteed commodity funds, which came out in
1986, put as much as 65% of investors' money into zero-coupon
government bonds. (A zero-coupon bond is one sold at a
discount to its face value, pays no annual interest, and
reaches its face value at maturity.) The idea was that even
if the fund lost money in commodities trading, the value of
the zero-coupon bond would grow enough over the life of the
fund to return investors' principal.
   The heavy commitment to zeros, however, left only 35% of
the investors' money for oil, gold, pork bellies or other
commodities-futures contracts. If the amount allocated to
futures trading were lost, trading would have to be halted
and investors would have to wait for the zeros to mature to
break even.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. brought out a zero-backed
guaranteed fund in February 1986 that was up 47% at the end
of April. A similar fund started by Shearson in June 1988 is
up only 3%.
   More recent funds have used different guarantee
approaches.
   In July 1989, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. brought out a
guaranteed fund that theoretically makes 100% of its assets
available for commodities trading. (Usually, only about 35%
of net assets will actually be devoted to trading.) This fund
uses a guarantee from the trading manager and a bank letter
of credit to insure that investors will be made whole at the
end of the fund's six-year life. As of the end of April this
fund was up 22%.
   The trading manager for the fund is Mint Investment
Management Co., a firm that has seven offshore guaranteed
funds. The first three of its funds brought out in 1986 are
all up more than 100%.
   James Klein, chairman of PaineWebber Futures Management
Corp., created another fund that took a different approach in
trying to boost performance. Some of its assets effectively
serve double duty: A portion of investors' money went to buy
zero-coupon bonds, which are held by his firm's parent,
PaineWebber Group Inc., in return for a letter of credit
guaranteeing that limited partners would be made whole.
   Mr. Klein says this arrangement effectively allowed 65% of
investors' money to be allocated to zero-coupon bonds and 70%
to commodity trading. He also structured his fund to have
lower fees than most public funds trading today. The fund,
which was closed to investors in January, is up a little over
2%.
   In the end, how well any of the guaranteed funds do will
hinge on the performance of their commodity trading advisers.
But to the extent that the guarantees take away from the
money going into commodity trading, or lead to higher
operating expenses, it raises the threshold the trading
advisers must clear before investors profit.
   And while having a guarantee may make investors more
comfortable, some question whether it's really necessary for
those who add commodities to a diversified portfolio.
   "We have been very timid in educating the public to think
of futures investments as a separate asset class," says
William Gianopulus, managing director of public offerings at
Index Futures Group Inc., a Chicago futures brokerage house.
He notes that investors probably already have a portion of
their portfolios in bonds so the guaranteed fund is, in part,
duplicating that portion and increasing the investor's costs.
"Do you give the investing public what they need or what they
think they want?"
