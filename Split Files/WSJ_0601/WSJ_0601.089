   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged the former chairman and chief executive officer of
Modulaire Industries with insider trading in the company's
1987 acquisition by Waste Management Inc.
   Other defendants charged by the SEC included the wife and
son of Modulaire's president, David Wailes. All defendants,
including former Chairman Joseph Behar, agreed to settle the
case without admitting or denying guilt and will pay a total
of more than $330,000 in penalties and disgorgement of
profit. Mr. Wailes wasn't charged.

   The SEC said that on May 7, 1987, Mr. Behar and Mr. Wailes
agreed to have the San Francisco-based supplier of modular
structures acquired by Waste Management at $16 a share. The
stock was selling at about $7 each. After the announcement of
the deal before the market opened on May 11, the share price
jumped to more than $15.
   On May 8, Deborah Castellucci bought 5,400 Modulaire
shares based on nonpublic information given to her by Mr.
Behar, the SEC said. She had been hired by Modulaire two
years earlier to devise a pension plan for the company.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Wailes had been keeping his wife, Adrienne,
apprised of the progress of negotiations, the SEC said; about
8:32 a.m., May 8, he called her from his office. Mrs. Wailes
then began calling friends and relatives "in rapid succession
to tip them to buy Modulaire before the acquisition was
announced," according to the complaint.
   The SEC said Mrs. Wailes called: Dorothy Carter, whose
husband, Donald, bought 4,300 shares; Mary Alice Graves, who
bought 750 shares, and Christopher Scott, who bought 4,200
shares but canceled his purchases before settlement. Dorothy
Carter then spoke to her son-in-law Jon Treder to pass along
the tip, the SEC said. He bought 1,500 shares and his father,
who wasn't charged, bought 750, the agency said.
   The Wailes' son, Deven, who lived with his parents, also
found out about the takeover from his mother and bought 5,000
shares, although he also canceled the order before
settlement.
   Under their settlement agreements, Mr. Behar will disgorge
$43,200, which amounts to Ms. Castellucci's profit. Ms.
Castellucci and Mr. Behar also will each pay a penalty of
$43,200.
   Mrs. Wailes will pay a penalty of $78,130 representing the
profit of the people she allegedly tipped. The Carters will
disgorge and pay a penalty totaling $81,675, including Mr.
Treder's profit. Mr. Treder will pay $30,525 in profit and
penalty, including his father's profit. Ms. Graves will pay a
total $12,375 in disgorgement and penalty.
   Christopher Scott and Deven Wailes have agreed not to
violate securities laws in the future.
   Mr. Behar's attorney, Kurt Mueller, said that by settling,
his client "is neither admitting nor denying guilt. In fact,
he does not admit it." He also said Mr. Behar agreed to
settle because it would cost "far more to litigate this case
than to settle it, not to mention the grief that litigation
would cause."
   Ted Phillips, attorney for Ms. Castellucci, declined to
comment.
