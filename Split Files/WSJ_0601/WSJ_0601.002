   TOKYO -- Construction of 147,845 houses got under way in
Japan in April, a 0.5% increase from a year earlier, the
Construction Ministry said.
   The rise was in line with a general trend upward,
sustained by long-lasting economic growth led by domestic
demand. Though housing starts fell 2% in March, they have
been rising consistently since August 1989.

   Meanwhile, a research institute said housing starts in the
fiscal year that began in April will total about 1.5 million
units, a 10% decline from fiscal 1990, and the same as the
Construction Ministry's earlier estimate.
