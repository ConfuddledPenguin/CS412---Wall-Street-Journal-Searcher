   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, an
auto maker, said its world-wide group sales in this year's
first five months totaled 11.6 billion marks ($6.89 billion),
up 3% from a year earlier.
   Chairman Eberhard V. Kuenheim, in remarks prepared for
BMW's annual meeting, said the company produced 237,000 autos
in the first five months, but didn't provide a year-earlier
comparison. He said new registrations of BMWs world-wide at
231,000 units were little changed from a year earlier.
