   WASHINGTON -- A federal grand jury here indicted Nynex
Corp. on one count of criminal contempt for violating the
consent decree that broke up the Bell System, the first case
charging a violation of the decree, the Justice Department
said.
   The department said Nynex willfully provided information
services through its Telco Research Corp. unit, a small
software company based in Knoxville, Tenn. Specifically,
Telco Research provided MCI Communications Corp. with a
service that allowed MCI to gain access to Telco Research
computer facilities and obtain information on the cheapest
way to configure telecommunications networks for customers.
The department said the service was illegally provided
between April 11, 1986, and February 1987.

   A Nynex spokesman said the company believes there is no
violation of the consent decree, and that the charge is
without merit. Nynex, he said, had discontinued the
arrangement with MCI early in 1987 "to eliminate any policy
question." Indeed the company said that in May 1986 it had
called the activity to the Justice Department's attention to
avoid any possible problems.
   Besides, the spokesman said, Telco's revenue from the
operation was a minuscule part of Nynex's business and that
it was "clearly ludicrous" to believe that Nynex would
willfully risk a criminal charge over the revenue. He
estimated the revenue amounted to "less than 2% of the annual
revenue of Telco Research and less than 1/1000 of 1% of Nynex
revenue overall" in 1986.
   The Justice Department investigation began in late 1986
after Scott Rafferty, a lawyer who was hired by Nynex to head
up Telco's consulting operation, questioned Telco's
compliance with the consent decree. Mr. Rafferty, who was
dismissed by the company when it folded the consulting
operation, complained to the Justice Department late in 1986,
alleging violations of the consent decree's ban on providing
information services.
   Apparently some within Nynex weren't completely confident
that all of Telco's activities clearly fell within the bounds
of the consent decree. In a November 1986 memo written
shortly after Telco officials decided to withdraw from the
consulting business and fired Mr. Rafferty, Barbara Morris, a
Nynex lobbyist and wife of Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.), wrote
that Mr. Rafferty had questioned a corporate lawyer about
whether the activities were legal.
   The lawyer, Ms. Morris wrote, "told Scott they were but
told me he's not so sure. . . . There was room for
interpretation and Nynex interpreted in its own favor. A
close look by someone else could result in different
conclusion."
   Mr. Rafferty has filed suit against the company, including
a recent action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law.
   The Telco matter was investigated by a special Justice
Department task force set up to examine allegations of
illegal activities by the Baby Bells. Constance Robinson, who
heads the task force, said her unit is investigating other
companies for decree violations. She declined to elaborate
but said, "We think it is important that consent decrees are
enforced."
   The consent decree, which was signed in 1982, bars Nynex
and the six other regional Baby Bell telephone companies from
providing information services, which generally allow
customers to obtain computer-based information over the
telephone lines. "A court order is the law and companies
bound by a decree are not free to deliberately or recklessly
disregard that decree," said James F. Rill, head of the
Antitrust Division. He called the Bell decree "the most
significant antitrust consent decree of recent decades" and
said the companies "must take all steps necessary to ensure
that they comply with the decree."
   The department said there isn't a maximum penalty under
the criminal statute used in the Nynex case.
   The case is to go to trial before Judge Harold Greene, the
federal district court judge who oversees the consent decree.
   For Nynex, the indictment was a second major blow from
Washington. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications
Commission proposed a record $1.2 million fine against the
company and rebates to customers for alleged overcharges by a
Nynex supply subsidiary to the company's two telephone units.
Nynex is contesting the proposed fine. The FCC action already
had given some lawmakers pause as they consider legislation
that would free the Baby Bells from consent-decree
restrictions that bar them from providing information
services, manufacturing telecommunications equipment and
entering the long-distance business.
   Opponents of freeing the Bells are likely to use the
indictment to bolster arguments that the Baby Bells have the
incentive and the inclination to break antitrust laws.
   The Nynex spokesman emphasized that the indictment and the
FCC proceeding aren't related and that the company is
confident lawmakers won't let the charges cloud their
decisions on the future of telecommunications policy.
