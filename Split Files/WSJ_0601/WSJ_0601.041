   PARIS -- The industrialized world's economic leaders
committed themselves to completing multilateral trade talks
successfully this year, but remained divided over how to cut
back agricultural subsidies.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
a club of 24 wealthy countries, also said in the communique
at the end of its annual meeting that recent changes in
Eastern Europe affirm Western democratic values and improve
"the prospect of a truly integrated global economic system."

   Although pleased with recent economic growth, the OECD
said that to ensure continued expansion, further
international economic cooperation and action is needed to
lower inflation, reduce unemployment, cut trade and payment
imbalances, promote stable exchange markets, sustain
investment and -- where appropriate -- encourage higher
savings.
   The U.S. in particular is eager to boost its savings rate.
"There is a world shortage of funds," Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady told reporters at a breakfast meeting, and
expressed his belief that current U.S. budget negotiations
would "put savings back in the pool."
   The OECD statement, which is something of a primer for
issues that may be raised in Houston during the July summit
of the leaders of the seven major industrial nations, clearly
identified the areas that need to be negotiated to achieve a
solid global-trade agreement. It called for greater
integration of environmental considerations into economic
decision-making, and welcomed negotiations aimed at cutting
the use of so-called tied-aid credits. Such subsidized
credits are used by nations to win business for their
companies.
   The OECD countries, which include the U.S., Japan and
Western European nations, also said that "every effort should
be made to eliminate or bring under enhanced discipline"
trade-distorting industrial subsidies, and indicated that
they will try to achieve this goal through the current talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   A successful outcome of the GATT round has "the highest
priority on the international economic agenda," the OECD
communique said. The group also firmly committed itself to
the broadening of the GATT treaty that is being sought in the
current Uruguay Round of trade talks, named for the country
where the negotiations began in 1986.
   This broadening would extend the GATT, which has 97 member
countries, to cover services, trade-related investment,
agriculture, textiles, and intellectual property -- such as
software and copyrights. It also will entail ensuring that
developing nations are properly integrated into the GATT and
offered the benefits of open markets -- particularly in
textiles and agriculture -- along with the disciplines of
strengthened trade rules and dispute-settlement mechanisms.
Until now, the GATT has primarily covered tariffs in the
industrialized world.
   But this broad boost for the GATT was jarred by a sharp
disagreement over agricultural subsidies between the U.S.,
backed by Canada, Australia and New Zealand, on one side and
the 12 European Community nations on the other. The EC
refused to address export subsidies specifically, but offered
to address all agricultural subsidies in the aggregate.
   As a result, the OECD's final statement included two
versions of what should be done to revamp agricultural trade
fundamentally. The U.S. and its allies "feel that
negotiations should proceed to seek specific policy
commitments in each area of the negotiations: internal
support, barriers to market access and export subsidies," the
communique said. But EC nations "prefer to seek reductions in
support and protection with commitments encompassing all
measures affecting import access and export subsidies."
   U.S. leaders were blunt about the dispute. "It would be
easy to paper over the differences, but that wouldn't advance
the cause," said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. "It's
time to let the world know that there are major differences,
and cause people to focus on them." There won't be a GATT
agreement on agriculture "unless the European Community is
prepared to be more forthcoming on export subsidies," Mr.
Yeutter told reporters.
   Speaking for the U.S.-led group, Trade Representative
Carla Hills said export subsidies are "the most pernicious"
form of agricultural subsidies as they lead to immense
overproduction and widespread international dumping. This in
turn causes big distortions in agricultural trade that
particularly disadvantage other food exporters, including
many developing countries.
   The EC wasn't giving any ground, though. It "attaches
great importance to maintaining certain price and supply
stability in the interest of both producers and consumers,"
said Ray MacSharry, the EC's senior agricultural official.
Exports subsidies, he said, are "an integral part" of the
EC's price system.
   The OECD isn't in doubt about the cost of agricultural
subsidies. In its communique, the group said that altogether
they cost OECD taxpayers and consumers $245 billion in 1989,
a decline from $280 billion in 1988, but still higher than
for any year before 1986.
