   VENTURA, Calif. -- Benton Oil &amp; Gas Co. said it completed
the Steidlmayer 6-2A well in Colusa County, Calif., which
tested at a rate of 4.9 million cubic feet of natural gas a
day without water. Calculated absolute flow was determined to
be 9.6 million cubic feet a day.
   The well was tested using a 16/64ths-inch opening with
flowing tubing pressure of 3,083 pounds per square inch. The
well was drilled to 7,750 feet and output was found between
7,588 feet and 7,624 feet.
