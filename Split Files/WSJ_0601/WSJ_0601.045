   BANGKOK, Thailand -- A few residents gathered earlier this
month for a ceremony to mark a loan repayment of 65,000 baht
($2,527) to Citibank's Thailand branch.
   Citibank has lent 1.5 million baht, free of interest, to
160 families in the Wat Chonglom low-income community to
better their lives and establish income-generating
enterprises. The bank and its advisers hope the project can
revamp the philosophy of corporate aid by giving the
recipients goals and responsibilities that lead to
self-sustaining improvements.

   Businessmen from domestic and multinational companies are
paying close attention to the ideas behind Citibank's
venture, and another organized in 1987 in Saraburi province
by Swedish Motors Corp., which assembles and markets Volvo
cars in Thailand under license from AB Volvo. If the two are
successful, the executives say, they will represent a more
effective way for companies to channel their aid efforts to
the poor.
   Both projects are the brainchild of Roger Chical, a
68-year-old French physician who retired in 1985 as the World
Health Organization's chief of mission in Bangkok. Dr. Chical
has spent much of his professional life in aid work in Africa
and Asia. Along the way, he says he discovered that most of
what he did for international relief organizations didn't
work and didn't last beyond his tour.
   In casting about for alternatives, Dr. Chical came up with
a simple theory. The poor, whether in urban or rural areas,
know their problems better than corporations, governments or
international agencies, he says. If they are provided with
the opportunity and responsibility to plan their own
improvements, they can do it. If they are loaned money rather
than given money, they will make good on their obligations,
he says. The key to is to make knowledge and resources
available and then leave the community to function.
   Community-development officials point out that his isn't a
new idea, but Dr. Chical and Citibank are willing to give the
recipients a lot more room to work on their own.
   Dr. Chical "believes that communities or people should be
left to do everything possible to help themselves," says
Charles Ames, Bangkok-based director of Foster Parents
International, a community-development program. "{Dr. Chical}
doesn't like nongovernmental organizations to do anything for
people. He believes that communities should only get
resources that they can use, and aid officials should only be
consultants. Then let the communities proceed at their own
pace."
   For Citibank, the Wat Chonglom project was at least partly
born out of frustration, says Kenneth S. Paley, the bank's
vice president in Thailand for consumer services. Like many
multinational institutions, the bank contributes substantial
amounts to charity in the countries where it has branches.
But often, he says, there is no control over the money, and
no monitoring of how it is spent.
   "We didn't know how effective it was, or what happened to
it after we gave it," he says. "Each of these might be a
great charity, but we give once and there's no
follow-through."
   The bank's experiment began in August 1988. Dr. Chical had
been searching for an urban community to put his ideas into
practice. He found it in Wat Chonglom, where he and Citibank
officials held meetings with residents to ask what they
needed to do to improve their lives. Dr. Chical emphasizes
the importance of not forcing the project on the community.
   Under his tutelage, the community developed a program to
meet what he calls basic minimum needs -- "food, water,
shelter, education, health, social and spiritual development,
and some income" -- a list he developed as a WHO
representative.
   The changes in Wat Chonglom since that meeting are all the
more remarkable for the stark contrasts they offer with other
low-income communities nearby, where residents tread amid
filth and mud.
   Wat Chonglom has put in cement sidewalks, and its trash is
picked up regularly. Houses have been improved structurally.
Residents have planted flowers in boxes throughout the
community. Nearby communities are eager to attempt similar
experiments.
   Most important for Dr. Chical's goals, the community
itself decided it could generate its own income by bringing
in a high-quality leather-goods business with the help of
Business in Thailand Ltd., a Bangkok marketing and trading
company. Residents are being trained for production of
leather goods, and 50,000 baht has been spent to buy leather
supplies. Other projects, including garment making and flower
arranging, are in progress, Mr. Paley says.
   Citibank and Dr. Chical hope Wat Chonglom has attained
enough momentum to keep going. "This is a fundamental thing,"
the physician says. "It has become a partnership for
development that includes business."
   Citibank officials say there is a long way to go at Wat
Chonglom in one aspect of the partnership. The bank
originally scheduled three to 10 years for repayment of its
loan. But two repayments have been made in less than two
years, including the one earlier this month, putting the
community well ahead of schedule, Mr. Paley says.
