   NORSK HYDRO AS (Stockholm) -- Egil Myklebust, a
48-year-old lawyer who heads a Norwegian business and
industry confederation, was designated chief executive
officer of this state-controlled petroleum, fertilizer and

retire next year. Mr. Myklebust, a former veteran executive
at Norsk Hydro, will rejoin the company in the fall and is
expected to serve as deputy to Mr. Aakvaag before succeeding
