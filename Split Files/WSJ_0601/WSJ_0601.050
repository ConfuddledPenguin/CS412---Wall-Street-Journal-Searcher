   LOS ANGELES -- After nearly seven years of all-out war,
the families running the Guess and Jordache jeans businesses
want to concentrate again on plastering their labels on
millions of consumers, rather than spending their time in
court.
   The determination to spend more time in the office than
the courtroom comes in the wake of Wednesday's surprise
announcement that the Marciano brothers of Guess Inc. of Los
Angeles and the Nakash family of Jordache Enterprises in New
York agreed to end their bitter fight by restoring Guess'
complete ownership to the Marcianos.

   The Nakashes, in exchange for the half-ownership of Guess
that they bought for about $5 million in 1983, will receive
an undisclosed portion of $106 million of Guess profits that
have been placed in an escrow account and full ownership of a
jointly owned subsidiary, Gasoline. A dozen related suits,
scattered from Hong Kong to the U.S., also will be settled.
   But in keeping with the years of acrimony, the Marcianos
face another legal dogfight that may affect the settlement.
Marshall B. Grossman, a lawyer who was replaced by the
Marcianos as they entered into settlement talks, filed a $17
million lien against the Marcianos' settlement proceeds.
   The Marcianos had promised Mr. Grossman a $10 million
bonus if he restored control of their apparel empire to them,
but later charged him with trying to block the settlement.
   Paul Marciano, the Marciano family spokesman, called the
filing "unprofessional and unconscionable," and said the
company has already paid about $10 million to Mr. Grossman's
firm. Mr. Grossman declined to confirm the action, citing
attorney-client privilege, but said his firm "has taken no
action whatsoever" that will block the settlement.
   Pierce O'Donnell, who negotiated the settlement with the
Nakashes on behalf of the Marcianos, said it's unclear what
effect the lien will have, but said the families are
"remaining calm."
   That calmness is atypical of the dispute, which eventually
involved the Internal Revenue Service, a Congressional
inquiry and bitter charges of fraud and deception. But
despite the tremendously expensive legal proceedings -- which
racked up more than $80 million in legal fees -- both
families appear to have kept their apparel lines in strong
positions amid a volatile retail setting.
   Guess, founded in December 1981 with $170,000 in capital,
now employs 1,000 people and had more than $500 million in
sales last year after positioning itself as a status label
among free-spending younger consumers. "Their licensing
business has great potential," said Alan Millstein, a retail
consultant who publishes an industry newsletter. "The lawsuit
apparently made them hunker down, but now they'll probably
expand aggressively."
   Paul Marciano says a career fashion line for women is
doing well, as are a relatively new line of prescription
eyeglass frames, a fragrance line and a licensed handbag
line. "We intend to open broader on new products, but we
intend to keep our distribution tight, limited," Mr. Marciano
said, referring to Guess' upscale distribution channels that
include major department stores.
   Jordache, founded by the Nakash brothers in 1978, is
firmly geared toward a more cost-conscious crowd. "Jordache
is almost exclusively sold through mass merchants, but it's
carved out a real niche," said Deborah Brontson, an apparel
analyst with Prudential-Bache Research.
   Joe Nakash, Jordache's chairman, says the company expects
total wholesale and licensed business sales to hit $700
million this year. "Now that this is all over, we want to be
a billion-dollar company," he added. Mr. Millstein, the
consultant, said that although the basic denim business has
been depressed in recent years, Jordache has lessened the
risk of a downturn in its basic business with a widespread
licensing program.
