   A former partner of defendant John A. Mulheren Jr. said he
had several conversations with Mr. Mulheren about illegal
securities trades that Mr. Mulheren did with Ivan F. Boesky,
the convicted former stock speculator.
   Edward McCarthy, a former general partner and chief
financial officer of Mr. Mulheren's defunct firm, Jamie
Securities Co., provided details that indicated for the first
time that Mr. Mulheren may have known that Mr. Boesky needed
to do illegal securities trades to evade net capital
requirements.

   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities fraud and keeping false records in connection with
his dealings with Mr. Boesky.
   Testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecution, Mr.
McCarthy said Mr. Mulheren talked to him about trades with
Mr. Boesky in shares of Unocal Corp. in June or July of 1985.
He said Mr. Mulheren asked him to keep the Unocal holdings
"separate on the daily accounting sheets" because "it was
Ivan's." Mr. Mulheren is accused of buying Unocal and other
securities from Mr. Boesky's company with the understanding
that those securities would later be repurchased by Mr.
Boesky.
   Mr. McCarthy said that in the late summer and early autumn
of 1985, Mr. Mulheren "asked me if we had enough buying power
to buy three or four large positions" from Mr. Boesky because
"Boesky has a capital problem." Mr. McCarthy said that after
he advised Mr. Mulheren that Jamie had enough money, Jamie
purchased four different securities from Mr. Boesky with the
understanding that those securities would later be sold back.
   In October 1985, Mr. Mulheren "asked me how much money we
were up or down" from the securities held for Mr. Boesky, Mr.
McCarthy said. Mr. McCarthy said that he later told Mr.
Mulheren that Jamie had a profit of about $500,000 from the
securities.
   Soon after, Mr. Mulheren told Mr. McCarthy that "Ivan
wanted his money back." Mr. McCarthy said he responded,
"Let's send him a check," and the two then laughed about it.
He said Jamie decided it would inflate brokerage bills it
paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company in late 1985.
   Mr. McCarthy corroborated much of the testimony provided
earlier this week by Michael Davidoff, a former key aide to
Mr. Boesky. Mr. McCarthy, who works for New York-based Dreman
Value Management Inc., a money management firm, is scheduled
to continue his testimony on Monday.
   Neither Mr. McCarthy nor Mr. Davidoff appeared to help the
government's case against Leonard DeStefano, a 34-year-old
former trading assistant who worked for Mr. Mulheren. Mr.
DeStefano is accused of inflating the brokerage bills and
keeping score of how much Mr. Boesky was owed as a result of
the allegedly illegal trades. Both witnesses said they had no
knowledge that Mr. DeStefano ever knew that he was being
asked to inflate the bills to compensate for money owed Mr.
Boesky from illegal trades.
