   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- An outspoken law-and-order advocate was
appointed as Taiwan's finance minister, underlining the
government's recognition of the need for financial-market
reform.
   The appointment of 51-year-old Wang Chien-shien as finance
chief was part of a new cabinet announced yesterday.

   Mr. Wang, a tax specialist, has been a vocal critic of the
rampant corruption in Taiwan's stock market. "He's clean,
tough and very impatient, so I think that he will speed up
financial reform," said C.C. Chen, vice president of
International Commercial Bank of China. Mr. Wang succeeds
Shirley Kuo.
   Analysts said another significant change in the new
cabinet, which was approved by the ruling Kuomintang, was the
appointment of Vincent Siew as economics minister. During his
18 years in various trade posts, Mr. Siew has become known as
a skilled negotiator who can get what he wants without
ruffling feathers.
   For the most part, however, when Defense Minister Hau
Pei-tsun becomes premier tomorrow, the faces in his cabinet
will be much the same as those under his predecessor, Lee
Huan. Mr. Hau, 70, will retain most of the technocrats who
have been serving in the cabinet for the past two years,
although some will be changing jobs. The new cabinet will be
sworn tomorrow.
   Analysts said that one of Mr. Wang's priorities will be to
clean up the stock market and close Taiwan's remaining
gray-market investment houses. He also is expected to
increase the pressure on Taiwan's companies to become listed
on the stock exchange. The move would force more companies to
disclose financial information, making it easier for the
government to collect taxes.
   Mr. Siew, the new economics minister, formerly headed the
Board of Foreign Trade. Two years ago, when farmers were
protesting the import of U.S. agricultural products, Mr. Siew
tried to calm the angry crowd in front of his office. He
continued smiling and talking even while being pelted with
eggs and rotten fruit.
   Patience will come in handy for the 51-year-old official.
One of his biggest tasks will be to work out compromises
between industrialists and environmentalists. Battles between
these two groups have halted the construction of many
projects, including petrochemical plants and power-generation
facilities.
   One of Taiwan's smoothest diplomats, Fredrick Chien, 55,
who was de facto ambassador in Washington from 1985 to 1988,
will be minister of foreign affairs. The current foreign
minister, 53-year-old Lien Chan, will become governor of
Taiwan province. Analysts expect Mr. Chien to continue
efforts begun by Mr. Lien to be more practical than
ideological in expanding Taiwan's contacts with nations that
recognize China.
   Mr. Chien has been serving as chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, an agency that coordinates
government research and planning. He will be succeeded in
that job by Ms. Kuo, the current finance minister. Ms. Kuo,
dubbed the "Iron Lady" when she took on stock-market
speculators by announcing a capital-gains tax in September
1988, turned out to be unsuited for such a high-profile post,
according to analysts.
   The current economics minister, Chen Li-an, will succeed
Mr. Hau as defense minister. The appointment of Mr. Chen,
whose father was premier and vice president under
Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek, has raised some controversy. He
served only four months in the military, while the usual
requirement is for all males to serve two years. Mr. Chen,
52, was exempted from active duty after basic training in
1954 so that he could study in the U.S.
