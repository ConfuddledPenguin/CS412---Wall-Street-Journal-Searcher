   NORWALK, Conn. -- Alcide Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, Elliott J. Siff, resigned after 10 years
with the manufacturer of disinfecting pharmaceuticals and
systems.
   "It's a good, opportune time for someone to come in and
take over management," the 59-year-old Mr. Siff said. The
company narrowed its loss to seven cents a share from nine
cents for the nine months ended Feb. 28. Sales rose 12% to
$1.7 million.

   Mr. Siff says the company "will be close to break-even"
for the fourth quarter "and looks forward to a profitable
first quarter" of fiscal 1991.
   Alcide's products and systems destroy microorganisms
including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Its markets include
pharmaceuticals and health care, food processing and animal
health.
   Mr. Siff, who will continue with Alcide as a consultant,
plans to work on some new projects. One he mentions is a $60
million blind pool: a fund formed by investors from which Mr.
Siff hopes to start a number of high-technology companies in
various fields.
   While the company seeks out a successor, Thomas L.
Kempner, 63, will be chairman of the management committee and
acting chairman of the board. Mr. Kempner is chairman and
chief executive of Loeb Partners Corp., an investment banking
firm.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Alcide shares were
quoted at $1 bid, unchanged.
