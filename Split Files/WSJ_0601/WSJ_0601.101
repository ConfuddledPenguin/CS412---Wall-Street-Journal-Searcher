   WASHINGTON -- Space nuts take note: The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is looking for new ideas
to get to Mars.
   But it isn't paying for them.

   The space agency said it would spend $4.5 million to
canvass the public, aerospace companies and students for
innovative technologies to send astronauts to the moon again
and off to Mars. NASA Administrator Richard Truly said he
planned to write letters this month to universities and
professional societies asking them to make suggestions. He
even plans to set up an 800 number to field proposals.
   "We're trying to look at the big picture, big strategy and
big technologies," said Arnold Aldrich, NASA's exploration
chief. But he said he won't pay now for the suggestions, even
if they eventually result in new spaceships. The payoff would
come in contracts to formally study or build space equipment
-- which won't be awarded for several years, if then.
   NASA is reaching out for proposals at the behest of Vice
President Dan Quayle, who heads the National Space Council
and who directed the agency to "cast our net widely" in
searching for new space technology. The initiative also might
drum up interest in President Bush's plan to send astronauts
to Mars within 30 years, which so far has drawn yawns from
the public and derision from Congress.
   The space agency could certainly use some help. Its plan
to explore the moon and Mars comes with a $500 billion price
tag, making it a political non-starter. But the alternatives
proposed so far -- launching rockets from the ocean, placing
inflatable space stations in orbit -- have seemed kind of
silly and naive.
   Of course, with space exploration, imagination is crucial.
Yesterday, for instance, the Commerce Department released a
report chiding big aerospace concerns for lacking vision and
failing to invest in commercial space ventures. "Larger U.S.
companies could lose critical know-how to foreign competitors
as small, entrepreneurial U.S. companies turn overseas for
corporate support," the report warned.
   For its part, NASA is trying to branch out from its usual
reliance on big contractors to come up with space hardware.
At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Truly appointed former
Apollo astronaut Thomas Stafford to head a panel that would
review outside suggestions, along with government studies,
and make recommendations for the design of the exploration
program and the technologies to emphasize.
   High on NASA's most-wanted list are proposals for new
propulsion technologies. Using conventional rockets, a flight
to Mars would take a year -- enough time without gravity to
incapacitate an astronaut. Mr. Aldrich said he expected Mr.
Stafford's panel to recommend nuclear power to speed the
flight. Some inventors have proposed using exotic lasers and
even anti-matter engines.
   Said Mr. Stafford: "I think we'll be inundated" with
suggestions.
