   BALLENSTEDT, East Germany -- Pointing to the castle on the
stony hilltop above his house, Joachim Hake says he is happy
it might soon be reclaimed by its "rightful" owner, a prince
who fled to West Germany with his mother after World War II.
But on the matter of the Salzmanns' return, he isn't so sure.
   The Salzmanns are the West Germans who own the crumbling
villa next to Mr. Hake's small, tidy house. In 1982,
Ballenstedt's Communist bosses decided that the expansive
garden attached to the Salzmann villa was publicly owned, and
they gave Mr. Hake permission to build his house there.

   "I'm all for correcting the injustices of the past," says
the East German farmer. "But I can't very well pick up my
house now and move it." As if to fan his anxiety, a nattily
dressed West German couple showed up in his neighbor's yard a
few weeks ago, snapping photographs of the area. It was the
Salzmanns.
   Mr. Hake is just one of thousands of East Germans caught
in a mounting legal cross fire over who owns what in this
once staunchly Stalinist nation, whose former Communist
leaders expropriated much of the country's private property
and businesses years ago. Simply walking around Ballenstedt
-- a town of 9,000 people tucked into the picturesque
foothills of East Germany's Harz Mountains -- one encounters
enough potential land disputes to keep a good-sized law firm
in business for the next decade.
   East Berlin's new leaders want to dismantle the
state-ownership system, but they insist that former owners be
compensated rather than having their property returned. But
in a statement that might signal a dispute with East Berlin
on how to handle West Germans' claims on houses, apartments
and businesses in East Germany, the Bonn government said this
week that returning the property, not compensation, was the
correct course.
   "Expropriated property is, in principle, to be handed
back," said Hans Klein, chief spokesman for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government, following a Bonn cabinet meeting
at which the property question was discussed. "Only in
exceptional cases should compensation solutions be found," he
added.
   "There's a storm brewing in East Germany right now,
because many of the normal chains of property ownership were
broken by the Communists," says Hans-Jochen Moser, a West
German lawyer who helps people reclaim property in East
Germany.
   The property issue is so explosive, in fact, that it
wasn't addressed in the recently signed treaty on German
monetary and social union. Instead, the two countries agreed
to hash out a supplementary agreement dealing with the web of
property claims.
   West German experts estimate that as many as a million
people will lay claim to property they left behind in East
Germany when they fled west after World War II or during 40
years of Communist rule. There are also many West Germans who
either emigrated legally or inherited land from East German
relatives, but who, like the Salzmanns, didn't bother about
these legacies until now.
   Adding to the difficulty of arriving at a compromise is
the sheer complexity of trying to transfer vast amounts of
property into private hands without the best of everything
getting snapped up by relatively wealthy West Germans.
Indeed, the image of West Germans crowding back into the
country to take over factories and houses stirs deep
resentment among East Germans, who refer to is as "the big
sellout."
   The Social Democrats -- the leading opposition party in
Bonn and the junior partner in the government coalition in
East Berlin -- are pushing for protections for the East
Germans, such as limits on the sale of property to Westerners
and special rights of first refusal for East Germans.
Meanwhile, the Christian Democrats, who head the ruling
coalitions in both Germanys, favor the quickest return to
private property possible.
   Much as it may rankle, the East Germans have few options
but to welcome their prosperous neighbors. West Germans have
the money and motivation to undertake the wholesale
rebuilding of East Germany. If this doesn't happen, East
Germans will continue to flock over the border in search of
jobs and decent housing in the West.
   "This whole town needs to be put back into private hands
to create the incentive to invest," says Wolfgang Gurke,
Ballenstedt's newly elected Christian Democratic mayor. "But
figuring out how to do that is going to be a nightmare."
   In a cluttered room on the second floor of the town hall,
another harried official, Eberhard Dittmar, spends his days
sorting through more than 200 applications from residents who
want to buy their houses -- including one from Mr. Hake, who
is seeking to buy the land under his house. And besides that
of the prince, the city has also registered claims from a
half-dozen other West Germans. "Of course, we can't do
anything until this land issue is clarified by our
government," says Mr. Dittmar.
   The town actually started selling houses and land two
months ago, but it quickly stopped after rumors spread that
Communist bureaucrats were snatching up choice parcels for
themselves and ignoring potential conflicts with West German
claims. While this moratorium may be good for the cause of
justice, it is the sort of policy that has some West German
officials worried.
   West German business and political leaders, including
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have cautioned that delays in
privatizing property could slow the rush to redevelop East
Germany and make unification more painful. "If you want to
invest in a country, it means you're going to buy something
-- and you can't do that without clear ownership," says
Ulrich Schmid, the East Berlin-based representative of West
Germany's Dresdner Bank AG.
   Ballenstedt seems eager to welcome back its former
royalty, especially if that means an infusion of money.
Prince Eduard von Anhalt -- whose father's name, Herzog
Joachim von Anhalt, still evokes respectful admiration from
elderly residents -- has announced that he wants to reclaim
his family's castle, the remnants of a huge hotel, several
smaller palaces, and nearly 1,500 acres of farmland and
forests. It all belonged to his father, who perished at the
hands of the Communists after World War II.
   In an arrival that seems like a page from "Dr. Zhivago,"
the prince came to town in December, just after the Berlin
Wall opened, and found his family's crumbling castle divided
into apartments and a forestry school. He later rented a room
at the end of one of the building's abandoned corridors, just
to establish a base here.
   To calm local fears, he has vowed not to kick out anyone
who lives on his contested property. And he has announced big
plans to transform the castle first into a training center
for unemployed workers and later into a high-class
hotel-management school. He also wants to rebuild the hotel
outside the castle gates, once the most elegant in the
region. Most important, according to the locals, he says he
has backers in the West willing to bankroll his dreams.
   It all sounds wonderful to the residents of Ballenstedt,
who grumble that the castle was about to collapse anyway. Mr.
Gurke's Christian Democratic Union even campaigned on a
platform that included a promise to welcome back the prince.
"The city won't have any money to rebuild the castle," says
the mayor. "We need all our money for building apartments."
   At the center of such debates is East Germany's concept of
Volkseigentum, or "people's property." Everything snatched up
by the Communists during various waves of nationalization,
including the sweeping agricultural land reform of 1946
implemented by the Soviets, fell into this amorphous
category. The theory was that, since everyone owned the
property, everyone would take care of it.
   But like so many things in East Germany, the concept never
worked the way it was intended. Typically, the finest
properties were quietly distributed to party functionaries
and members of East Germany's hated secret police.
