   Stephen S. Hamilton ("To Educate the Young, Get Them out
of School," editorial page, April 30) observes that most
people learn best by doing something useful with what they
are learning. Without application, school learning fades
rapidly. During the past decade, the Institute for Human
Resource Development and others doing research and practical
work in the field of employment for people with severe mental
retardation and other disabilities have discovered that
"supported employment" works.
   Placing people in jobs and providing the support necessary
for them to learn and stay on the job is much more effective
than training or educating first and then finding a job where
specific retraining is almost always necessary. These
supported-employment programs have proved effective in making
the transition from school to work for this population. Those
concerned with the apprenticeship or partnership programs
recommended by Mr. Hamilton would be well advised to consider
the proven approaches and techniques developed for bringing
people with severe disabilities into the workplace. They can
work for all.
