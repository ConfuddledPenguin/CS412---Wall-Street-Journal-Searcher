   HOUSTON -- Daniel Industries Inc. said its directors
approved a plan under which shareholders would be allowed to
acquire new preferred stock in the event any group or
individual acquires more than 20% of the company.
   The producer of oil field equipment said that the plan
wasn't adopted in response to any specific takeover attempt
and that it wasn't aware of any such effort.
