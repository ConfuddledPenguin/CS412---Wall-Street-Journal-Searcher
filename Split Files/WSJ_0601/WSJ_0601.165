   NEW YORK -- Say goodbye to the easy-profit days of
investing in corporate spinoffs.
   Bargains used to be a dime a dozen among spinoffs, the
companies that are created when a corporation jettisons part
of its business, giving it away to shareholders in the form
of new stock.

   But the dangers of investing in spinoff stocks have risen
sharply in the past year, Wall Street analysts say. One
reason: The game is getting crowded as investors rush in,
driving up prices.
   Investing in spinoffs in the '80s "was like shooting fish
in a barrel," says veteran spinoff follower Charles W.
Neuhauser, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker in
Baltimore. "Almost anything you hit was a winner."
   By contrast, he says, in the past year and a half, most
new spinoffs haven't been "sufficiently undervalued to get me
fired up."
   A Bear Stearns study of 46 spinoffs from 1984 through 1988
found the stocks rose an average of 67% from the day they
were distributed through May 9 of this year. Boosting that
average were such home runs as Kaydon, spun off by Bairnco in
1984, which rose 525%; Masco Industries, part of Masco until
1984, up 358%; and York International, severed by Borg Warner
in 1986, up 297%.
   The drill for investors was simple. Knowing that even the
best spinoff stocks often tend to decline early in their
lives, savvy traders would snap up the shares at bargain
prices, then wait for them to take off.
   "You could have bought most of them and, in general,
outperformed" the overall market, says Bear Stearns analyst
Frederick A. Wise.
   Not any more. "Today, they are coming out at higher
prices," Mr. Wise says. Moreover, "they go down a little
further" for a time after their launch, making it tougher for
investors to pinpoint the best time to buy.
   Among the decliners in Mr. Wise's study -- which excluded
companies formed in the once-in-a-lifetime breakup of the
Bell Systems -- were auto parts maker Schwitzer, off 56%
through yesterday; warehouse retailer Waban, down 51%; and
plumbing supply company Eljer Industries, off 40%. All three
of these spinoffs began trading last year.
   Peter Lynch, the renowned stock-picker who recently
retired, said in his well-known book, "One Up on Wall
Street," that spinoffs "often result in astoundingly
lucrative investments." But is the spinoff party now over,
just as traders are speculating that a wave of spinoffs by
debt-ridden companies is about to break?
   Both Mr. Neuhauser and Mr. Wise (who succeeded him on the
spinoff watch at Bear Stearns) give a cautious "no" to that,
at least for selective, patient buyers.
   "Now that more people have caught on, we're back to Square
One, where you have to look at each one of these stocks
individually," says Mr. Neuhauser.
   No longer does he jump on spinoffs as they come out of the
chute. Mr. Neuhauser now is looking at issues that have been
seasoned for a year or two, time enough for the initial
enthusiasm to have worn off. "Through lack of interest, these
things have sunk down under their own weight {to become}
attractively undervalued," he says of a few of his favorites.
   One of those is Sprague Technologies. Spun off by Penn
Central in August 1987 at 16, the stock traded as high as 20
before the October 1987 market crash. Sprague later plunged
to 4, and it closed yesterday at 5, down 1/8, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   "I think it is worth twice what it's selling for," Mr.
Neuhauser says.
   Another on his list is Scotsman Industries, which was
distributed to Household International shareholders in April
1989 (as were Schwitzer and Eljer). Scotsman, a maker of
refrigeration products, began trading around 13 but fell by
almost half when poor earnings were reported this year. Mr.
Neuhauser labels it "definitely a bargain" at its current
price. It closed unchanged yesterday at 8, also in Big Board
trading.
   Mr. Wise, in reviewing most spinoff stocks issued since
1984, found that more than half of them dropped in their
first month of trading. This pattern might suggest that
people who receive shares in a spinoff should consider a
quick sale. By the end of six months, however, almost
three-quarters of the new stocks had moved above their
initial prices.
   Scott L. Greiper, publisher of Bits &amp; Pieces, a New
York-based research letter that tracks spinoffs for
institutional investors, agrees that the game has become more
difficult. But he still says spinoffs can offer splendid
buying opportunities in their early months.
   He cites this year's formation of Promus by Holiday. The
stock began trading at 30 5/8 in February and fell to 24 1/4
in eight trading days. It then recovered, declined again to
23 1/4 in April and rebounded again, closing yesterday in Big
Board trading at 29 7/8, down 3/8.
   That adds up to some nice returns for buyers who took
advantage of the stock's early weakness. But the best might
be still to come for the stock. Mr. Greiper says that most
spinoffs are "really value plays that take 12 to 18 months to
show their true grit."
   Analyzing infant companies is far from child's play.
Financial data can be sketchy. Their first earnings reports
often don't match inflated expectations, and that can send
shares reeling "to depths unimagined at the time of the
spinoff," Mr. Wise says. He also points out that the spinoff
successes of the 1980s came in an extended bull market that
won't always be there.
   Mr. Neuhauser questions whether a big bulge in spinoffs is
around the corner. He says the spinoffs of the '80s were
often anti-takeover moves, and such moves have become less
necessary with the demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
the slump in the junk bond market.
   About a dozen spinoffs are in the works at the moment,
including ones approved or under consideration by Honeywell,
Bairnco, May Department Stores, Quaker Oats and Santa Fe
Pacific. But the go-ahead on a spinoff can take months from
when it is first proposed, so buying the parent company's
stock when spinoff plans are announced can be dangerous.
Castle &amp; Cooke's stock jumped 3 1/4 on its February
announcement that it planned to spin off its Dole Food unit,
then lost 4 on last month's announcement that it was putting
off the spinoff.
   "I don't even bother with these things until they have
been officially declared," Mr. Neuhauser says. A snarl like
the one at Dole is unusual, he says, but "quite often the
terms and the makeup will change any number of times between
the announcement and the initial distribution."
