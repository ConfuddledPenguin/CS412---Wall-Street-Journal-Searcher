   Oil prices plunged as a gasoline-fed rally collapsed in
the wake of an industry report of increased petroleum
inventories.
   Although the report by the American Petroleum Institute,
released late Wednesday, involved only U.S. inventories,
prices of crude oil and fuels fell world-wide in hectic
trading.

   In European markets, spot prices of North Sea and Middle
East crudes were down 45 cents to 80 cents a barrel. On the
International Petroleum Exchange in London, futures prices of
Brent blend crude were 28 cents to 51 cents a barrel lower.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil for July
delivery dropped 68 cents to settle at $17.40 a barrel.
August crude was down 60 cents to $18.04.
   But the sharpest fall of all was in U.S. gasoline, which
had ignited the rally that swept through world petroleum
markets earlier this week. In the U.S. futures market, the
June contract for unleaded gasoline fell 2.98 cents a gallon
in its last day of trading to settle at 63.89 cents. The July
gasoline futures price was down the limit of two cents a
gallon to 61.26 cents.
   Despite the sharp decline in gasoline futures, industry
analysts maintained that the major factor in this week's
pricing reversal is the continuing concern over swollen
supplies of crude oil.
   "The market is going to maintain its downward momentum,
and the pressure is {from} the crude overhang," said Peter
Gignoux, manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton's international
energy desk in London.
   It has been evident for some weeks that the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been producing too much
oil. So far, OPEC hasn't made much progress in its early-May
agreement to reduce output as much as one million barrels a
day from the previously indicated April level of 23.5 million
barrels a day.
   The latest assessments by monitors of OPEC output suggest
that May production was down some from April -- but only
modestly. The OPEC Listener estimated yesterday that May
production was "certainly no lower than 23 million barrels a
day" and most likely in the range of 23.2 million barrels a
day. "This {June} will be the real test month to show whether
OPEC's `medicine' is working," the New York-based
industry-analysis service reported.
   But even though OPEC production may be declining, oil from
the previous high production levels will continue to flow
into the major consuming regions for some weeks. As a result,
U.S. crude oil inventories may continue to increase. And
yesterday's sell-off was triggered by the American Petroleum
Institute's latest report, which showed inventories of
gasoline and crude oil rose last week by 1.1 million barrels
and 2.1 million barrels, respectively.
   Still, there are some industry analysts who look for crude
inventory levels to quit rising soon. They note that U.S.
refineries are expanding operations after maintenance
shutdowns and will be using more crude oil to refine the
gasoline to meet seasonal needs.
   "By September, crude oil inventories should be at a
significant lower level," said Robert Boslego, a Winchester,
Mass., consultant.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were lower. The July delivery ended
with a decline of 0.65 cent a pound at $1.1085.
Price-depressants included economic indicators that continue
to show a slowing U.S. economy and expectations that London
Metal Exchange copper inventories Friday will show an
increase of 2,000 tons to 3,000 tons, said Fred Demler,
metals economist for PaineWebber. He noted that statistics
just released by the American Bureau of Metal Statistics, a
private organization, were largely bullish, but contain a
bearish undertone. Production of mined copper has declined,
due to lower output in Peru, Chile and Bougainville, Papua
New Guinea. Mine production of copper in March was down 5%
from a year before, after having gained 5% in January and
February, he said. World-wide deliveries of copper by
producers to consumers in the first quarter rose 8% from a
year earlier, but Mr. Demler said that stepped-up pace isn't
likely to continue. Producers' stocks outside the U.S. have
declined, but the drop is being offset by a growth of
inventories in the hands of U.S. producers, consumers and
both the London Metal Exchange and New York's Commodity
Exchange, he said. The two factors that are supporting copper
prices currently, he said, are concern over the labor
negotiations of the two remaining major U.S. copper
producers, whose contracts end on June 30, and the low level
of world supplies.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices eased. The July contract ended down
$25 a metric ton at $1,415. Prices swung over a wide range,
dropping in early trading to as low as $1,383 then recovering
to as high as $1,425 before easing toward the close. Judith
Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, noted that the political
turmoil in the Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa
producer, helped boost prices in recent weeks -- but
meanwhile exports from that country moved at an uninterrupted
pace and have continued to climb. But now that dock strikes
possibly may begin today in the Ivory Coast and Brazil, also
a major cocoa-bean grower, prices fell yesterday. "It seems
strange that factors which had nothing really to do with
cocoa pushed prices higher, but now that there are
developments that directly relate to cocoa, prices fall." she
said. "It may be a case of buy the rumor, sell the fact." She
said a report circulated early in the day that a French trade
house had rejected a Soviet request for extension of credit
in connection with a quantity of cocoa beans the firm has
bought for the Soviet Union. "Now the speculation is whether
those beans might be sold on the world market," she said.
"The development might have contributed to the early drop in
the futures prices, but it wasn't a major factor."
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog futures contracts
plunged in volatile trading on speculation that the slaughter
will temporarily jump next week, said Charles Levitt, an
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago. A spate of dry
weather in the Midwest is allowing many farmers to plant
crops delayed by unusually heavy rains this spring. Busy in
the fields, many farmers won't have time to bring their hogs
to market this week, so a glut might suddenly develop when
they do. Hog prices were vulnerable to a profit-taking
plunge, because they have been closing in on record high
levels. However, many analysts think that hog prices will
remain high this summer. Hog prices have been strong for
several months because of a tight supply of hogs ready for
slaughter. That is because many farmers were cautious about
expanding their herds last year. Because of tight supplies,
the hog slaughter is slipping instead of rising as it usually
does in the spring. Last week, the number of hogs killed at
federally inspected meat-packing plants dropped 6% from a
year earlier, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. The competition among
meatpackers to find hogs to kill has increased the price of
fattened hogs to 66 cents a pound in some Midwest markets,
just one cent below the record high. What might help keep hog
prices in check this summer is that the supply of alternative
meats, such as beef, is expected to rise. Prices of cattle
futures contracts settled mixed.
