   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Slate Corp., a software start-up
concern, said it hired software developer Robert Frankston
from Lotus Development Corp., in an action that reunites the
creators of VisiCalc, one of the first successful
personal-computer software programs.
   At Slate, Mr. Frankston will be working again with Daniel
Bricklin, the co-developer of VisiCalc. The two started
Software Arts in Mr. Frankston's house in Arlington, Mass.,
in 1979, and developed VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet. The
program helped get business people to start buying Apple
Computer Inc. personal computers, expanding the market beyond
hobbyists. It was later superseded by Lotus Development's
spreadsheet, 1-2-3.

   Slate is developing "pen-based software applications" for
a new class of computers that let users enter data by writing
on a screen with a stylus, rather than typing with a
keyboard. People in the industry say Slate is working on
software for note-pad computers that GO Corp., based in
Foster City, Calif., is expected to introduce later this
year.
   Mr. Frankston, 40 years old, had been working on network
computer software at Lotus. He said his title at Slate hasn't
been determined. He added that he will work with Mr.
Bricklin, a Slate co-founder and vice president, in Slate's
Watertown, Mass., offices.
