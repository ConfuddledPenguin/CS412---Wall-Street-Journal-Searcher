   NEW YORK -- S.E. Nichols Inc. said it won't make a $1.3
million interest payment due Friday, and will instead use a
30-day grace period to evaluate its options, including filing
for federal bankruptcy-law protection.
   The discount retail chain had disclosed its financial
difficulties, and the possibility of a bankruptcy court
filing, on May 4, when it posted a loss of $37.2 million, or
$7.90 a share, for its fiscal year ended Feb. 3. Nichols
reported revenue of $214.3 million.

   Those results included a fourth-quarter charge of $27
million related to its current shift to a deep-discounting
strategy.
   More recent cash-flow problems led to yesterday's
announcement, however, and James Herlihy, Nichols chief
financial officer, said the chain "needs to make some
decisions soon." He added that he doesn't yet know whether
the decisions will merely enable Nichols to make its interest
payment, or whether they will affect the company's entire
operations.
   "We felt (bankruptcy court) is a possibility, but I can't
rate it on a scale of 1 to 10," he said.
   The June 1 payment is due on a series of 14 7/8% first
senior subordinated debentures, of which there are $18.4
million outstanding, Mr. Herlihy said.
   Nichols also has $10.5 million of a 15% series of
debentures outstanding, with a payment of about $700,000 due
Sept. 1. Mr. Herlihy said the company may soon make an
announcement on the status of that payment.
   Nichols shares stood at 94 cents yesterday on the American
Stock Exchange, the price at which they closed in Wednesday
trading.
