   CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co., trying to stem the wave of
offshore competitors, is launching a $1 billion capital
spending program.
   The ambitious plan, to be completed by 1995, will more
than double the 91-year-old company's investment in plant and
equipment. But it's unclear whether the program will reap
dividends or help Timken surge ahead of the five larger
Japanese, Swedish and West German competitors.

   Indeed, Timken's most recent big capital project --
construction of a nearly $500 million specialty steel mill --
has yet to pay off. The mill contributed to Timken's sizable
losses from steel operations in 1985 and 1986 and has yet to
earn a satisfactory profit.
   Most of the $1 billion of planned capital investment is
going to build "21st Century" bearings factories that can
compete throughout the world, as well as modernize existing
facilities. "The bearings business has to be seen as a global
industry," says Peter J. Ashton, executive vice president,
bearings. More than a quarter of Timken's own sales last year
were made outside the U.S., thanks to plants in Australia,
Brazil, France, Britain and South Africa.
   Timken chose the massive $1 billion investment over a more
modest and slower upgrade of plants to produce sharp
improvements in productivity and quality. That difference may
determine whether Timken is a leader or a marginally
profitable also-ran in the world bearings industry. Timken
spent a total of just $180 million on its bearings plants
from 1983 to 1988. The company has been holding its own so
far, industry analysts say, but competition from larger
competitors is intensifying.
   The current investment plan assumes that the 1990s will be
kinder to cyclical smokestack companies than the past decade.
The 1980s began with back-to-back recessions, followed by
four years of the overvalued dollar. Timken's most recent
good earnings came in 1981 when the company earned $4.50 a
share. In 1989, which included a lengthy fourth-quarter
strike the company earned $55.3 million, or $1.88 a share.
Company officials said 1990 earnings will be higher but
wouldn't be specific.
   Timken executives were reminded this past week that
there's a risk in concentrating exclusively on long-term
growth. The stock spurted briefly in active trading following
a televised report that Timken was a takeover target of BTR
PLC, a big British concern. Timken officials refused to
comment on the report, and the stock activity died down.
   Some economists think the 1990s will be more favorable to
capital goods suppliers as the U.S., Europe, Japan and the
Soviet Union are forced to make huge investments in roads,
airports, and sewer systems. That investment should create
demand for bulldozers and other big machines, each of which
uses hundreds of bearings. At the same time, factories are
being rebuilt with intricate machinery, all moving with
friction-reducing bearings.
   The tapered roller bearing, which is still the company's
main product, resists extreme pressures from any direction.
As such, the bearings are used wherever heavy loads and side
pressure combine to put stress on the bearings, including car
and truck wheels, construction machinery and factory
equipment.
   The $1 billion spending plan is especially ambitious for
Timken, which has been controlled by the Timken family since
Henry H. Timken invented the tapered roller bearing back
before the turn of the century. W.R. Timken Jr., the current
chairman, is a great-grandson of the founder. Joseph F. Toot
Jr., Timken's president, was married to Mr. Timken's sister.
Family members still vote 19% of the stock, and an employee
savings plan owns an additional 5.5%.
   The company, whose spartan executive offices are at the
front of Timken's old bearings factory, is extremely
conservative. Management has kept Timken's debt to a minimum,
usually less than 5% of total capital. Moreover, executives
only slowly expanded business, resisting the urge to
diversify through acquisitions that caused problems for many
other industrial companies. Sales in 1989 were only 20%
higher than a decade earlier.
   But Timken isn't mired in the past. The company was one of
the first to switch to a business jet from propeller-driven
planes. Management refuses to slash research and development
spending even when incurring losses; last year's outlay of
$37.4 million is high for a smokestack company. The company
is credited with advances both in metallurgy and
manufacturing techniques that increased the life of its
bearings severalfold.
   Timken also took a gamble a few years back to build the
new Faircrest steel mill, which produces alloy steels used in
Timken bearings. Specialty steel also accounts for nearly
one-third of the company's $1.5 billion of annual sales. The
mill was completed ahead of schedule and below budget, and is
regarded as one of the most technologically advanced in the
country.
   But the timing of the construction was off. The dollar
soared while the mill was being built, inviting in foreign
steel at low prices, depressing U.S. exports and crippling
many industries that use steel. That combination created a
steel surplus that drove down prices. While conditions have
improved, Timken executives complain that prices for the
alloy steel bars that the mill produces remain depressed.
   "Timken is one of the companies with very long planning
horizons that are rebuilding this country," says Ronald
Petrie, machinery and manufacturing analyst with McDonald &amp;
Co., Cleveland. "They're not as concerned about quarterly
earnings gains as with the long-term growth of the company."
   He forecasts net of $2.50 a share for 1990 and $4 a share
for 1991, assuming that the economies of the U.S., Western
Europe and Asian and the Pacific region continue to show
gradual improvement.
   Earlier this week, Timken completed the $185 million
purchase of MPB Corp., Keene, N.H., moving the smokestack
concern into the precision aircraft bearings business.
Besides opening another segment of the world bearings market,
buying MPB offers an opportunity for transfer of technology
in precision manufacturing and specialty materials -- such as
high temperature ceramics -- that will strengthen Timken's
position in industrial markets.
