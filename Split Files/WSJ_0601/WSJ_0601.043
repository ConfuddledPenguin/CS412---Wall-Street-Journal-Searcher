   LONDON -- Thorn EMI PLC Chairman Colin Southgate said the
British music and electronics concern has reached an
agreement to sell its lighting unit to GTE Corp. of the U.S.
   Thorn said last month that it was holding talks with GTE,
a telecommmunications, lighting and precision-materials
group. In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Southgate
confirmed the sale agreement, but declined to give details.
He said Thorn had considered but dropped the idea of forming
a joint venture with GTE. "They will probably end up buying
the whole (lighting) business," he said.

   Mr. Southgate also confirmed that Thorn is negotiating to
buy a 50% stake in Hungaroton, Hungary's state record
company. The British concern previously had declined to
comment about reports of such talks.
   The deal "is still on the cards," and Thorn probably will
pay "less than #10 million ($17 million)" for the 50% stake,
Mr. Southgate continued. People familiar with the
negotiations had valued the 50% stake at #15 million to #17
million.
   The transaction, though small in dollar terms, would rank
as one of the biggest entertainment industry ventures thus
far in the rapidly changing East bloc. The Hungaroton
investment would give Thorn "a learning curve for moving into
the rest of Eastern Europe," Mr. Southgate said. He also
disclosed that Thorn is considering buying some small music
businesses in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   Separately, Thorn said yesterday that pretax profit in its
fiscal year ended March 31 rose 10%, to #318 million from
#289 million, helped by a doubling in earnings at its EMI
Music division. The results exceeded analysts' expectations.
   Thorn's directors proposed a final dividend of 21.5 pence
a share, bringing the full-year payout to 30 pence a share,
an 11% improvement on last year's 27 pence. Sales on the year
rose 13% to #3.72 billion from #3.29 billion.
