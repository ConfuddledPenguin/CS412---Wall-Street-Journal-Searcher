   I was appalled to read in your April 30 page-one article
that students in the English classes for amnesty-seekers in
Dallas were "absorb{ing} little English, but a lot of
humiliation." As an administrator in an English program
approved for amnesty, I speak with authority when I state
that all programs are not run in such a manner as the one you
visited.
   In Illinois all teachers in amnesty programs must be
trained in special workshops and experienced in teaching
English as a second language to adults. The teachers hired
are professionally trained people who respect the dignity and
self-esteem of their students. I agree it is unrealistic to
expect our students to learn English in only 40 hours. We are
attempting to help them gain some survival skills in English
and a basic knowledge of American history and government.
These skills, it is hoped, will enable them to improve their
lives and may even spark an interest in continued education
and in being "politically active in their new homeland," as
immigration attorney Juan Jasso urged them. Our students are
interested and enthusiastic and many continue in our program
long after their 40 hours for legalization are completed.
