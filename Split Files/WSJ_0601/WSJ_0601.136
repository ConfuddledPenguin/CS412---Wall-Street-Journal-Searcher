   Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. said it agreed to sell its
$125 million-a-year polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, business,
where weak pricing has hurt the Allentown, Pa., company's
profit recently.
   Terms weren't disclosed. The company said its earnings
this year won't be materially affected by the sale to the
Pacific Western Resin Co. unit of privately held Pacific
Western Extruded Plastics Co., a Eugene, Ore.-based PVC pipe
maker.

   Analysts said the divestiture is long overdue and will
improve Air Products' earnings prospects starting in 1991, by
reducing exposure to cyclical commodity chemicals. The PVC
business being sold includes two manufacturing facilities in
Kentucky and Florida, with total annual capacity of 400
million pounds. The deal, which Air Products expects to
complete within two months, after regulatory review, is part
of the company's strategy of shifting resources toward
higher-margin specialty chemicals. PVC represents about half
of the company's $240 million a year in sales of commodity
chemicals. Total chemical sales last year were $976 million.
