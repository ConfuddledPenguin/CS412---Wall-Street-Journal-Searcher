   QUEBEC -- The Quebec government, as expected, named
Jean-Claude Delorme chairman and general manager of Caisse de
Depot et Placement, the provincial government's powerful
pension fund agency.
   Mr. Delorme, 56 years old, is president and chief
executive officer of Teleglobe Canada Inc., a unit of Memotec
Data Inc., a Montreal telecommunications and communications
equipment concern.

   Mr. Delorme was appointed to a 10-year term, effective
July 1. He succeeds Jean Campeau, 58, chairman and general
manager since 1980. Montreal-based Caisse de Depot manages
34.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$29.1 billion) in assets and
is one of the biggest players in Canadian financial markets.
   The government also named Guy Savard, a Sherbrooke,
Quebec, accountant, as a director of Caisse de Depot, filling
a vacancy on the board. The government said it intends later
this year to create the new positions of president and chief
operating officer of Caisse de Depot. A government
spokeswoman said Mr. Savard "would be an interesting
candidate" for the new posts.
