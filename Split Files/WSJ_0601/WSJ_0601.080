   Protests are taking a new turn at the high-school level,
notably one last Friday at Eagle Rock High School in Los
Angeles. This walkout was in favor of tougher discipline
policies. "No more weapons]" the students chanted. After a
classmate was stabbed last week, they demanded that the
school board expel those who bring weapons to school. Later
Friday afternoon, another student was stabbed just off the
campus, now beset with gang violence after years of relative
calm. Alas, the city school board earlier this month
rejected, 6 to 1, a proposal to expel automatically anyone
caught with a weapon at school. The majority called the
measure too unwieldy and punitive. In Los Angeles as in many
parts of the nation, it may take some form of voucher or
choice mechanism to get insensate school officials to
recognize the real world.
