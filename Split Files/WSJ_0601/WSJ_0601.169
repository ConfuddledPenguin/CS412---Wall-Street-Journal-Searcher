   WASHINGTON -- Washington Bancorp. named John J. Mason
chairman and chief executive officer and gave preliminary
approval to a bailout plan for the cash-strapped bank holding
company.
   Mr. Mason, the 51-year-old former chairman of NS&amp;T
Bankshares Inc., owns 6.4% of Washington Bancorp. In
addition, he is one of two lead investors in the company's
planned issue of $45 million in new secured debt, announced
Tuesday.

   Washington Bancorp. also named Michael F. Ryan,
51-year-old former president of NS&amp;T Bank, as president and
chief operating officer. John M. Toups, who served as interim
chairman and chief executive after the January resignation of
Luther H. Hodges Jr., said he will go back into retirement
and remain a director.
   In early May, Washington Bancorp. said it wouldn't be able
to repay about $36.7 million of unsecured commercial paper
obligations because certain credit lines were cut off. The
company has since defaulted on most of that short-term debt.
   As part of the financial revamp plan, virtually all of
Washington Bancorp.'s assets will be pledged to secure the
$45 million in new debt, which will probably have a term of
12 months. In addition, Mr. Toups said the debt buyers will
receive warrants, with anti-dilution protection, to acquire
60% or more of the company's common stock at a "nominal"
price.
   Mr. Mason declined a request for an interview, but in a
statement, the new chairman said he has two immediate goals:
to end Washington Bancorp.'s liquidity crisis and to restore
public confidence in the company's principal subsidiary,
National Bank of Washington.
   Mr. Mason also resigned as a director of Richmond,
Va.-based Crestar Financial Corp. to devote more time to
Washington Bancorp. Crestar hasn't yet decided whether it
will fill the vacancy.
