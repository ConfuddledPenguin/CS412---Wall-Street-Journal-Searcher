   HONG KONG -- Hong Kong will expand its fledgling Exchange
Fund bill program to include treasury instruments that are
longer than 13 weeks in duration, David Nendick, the colony's
secretary for monetary affairs, said.
   Mr. Nendick said that he is pleased with the dozen weekly
auctions of the tax-free bills to date, but that some changes
will be made after the initial program ends next Tuesday. "To
enhance the effectiveness of the bills as money market
instruments, bills of other maturities up to 12 months may be
issued additionally from time to time," he said. The
government began auctioning off the 13-week bills in
mid-March to provide a mechanism to adjust liquidity in the
system. About 3.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$444.9
million) of bills have been offered in HK$300 million
installments.

   Hong Kong has had a steady stream of budget surpluses, so
it doesn't need to rely on treasury debt issues for fiscal
reasons. The auctions for Exchange Fund bills have found a
steady local appetite and are regularly oversubscribed.
