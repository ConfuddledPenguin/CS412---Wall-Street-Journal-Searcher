   NEW YORK -- Corporate buy-backs of junk bonds hit a record
$2.5 billion during the first quarter and are expected to set
new highs for the year.
   Dozens of companies that sold junk bonds to investors now
are rushing to buy them back at a steep discount. Traders say
that the surge in buy-backs is one reason -- along with
falling interest rates -- for the recent modest rally in the
sagging junk market.

   The buy-back trend started to sizzle after the junk-bond
market went into a tailspin last September. Since then,
prices of some high-yield, high-risk bonds have fallen as
much as 40%, creating opportunities for companies that have
access to large amounts of cash to buy back their debt on the
cheap.
   Tom Mandel, a portfolio manager at 1838 Investment
Advisors L.P., believes that corporate treasurers are among
the biggest buyers of junk bonds. "It's clearly a big help to
the market. People at least have bids for their bonds,
whereas before they could easily have not had any. You're not
always getting a fair price, but at least you're getting
something."
   Joseph Bencivenga, director and manager of high-yield
research at Salomon Brothers Inc., said the buy-backs have
provided a firm floor under the depressed junk market.
   Most of the $2.5 billion of junk bonds that corporations
bought back in the first quarter were repurchased informally
in the open market, according to statistics compiled by First
Boston Corp. But the figures also include bonds that were
formally "called" or retired.
   The buy-backs are great for the issuers, which get to
retire their debt at a discount to face value in transactions
that can boost earnings. In recent months, traders have
spotted Burlington Industries Inc., Mark IV Industries Inc.,
Coltec Industries Inc., Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and many others
actively buying back their bonds.
   But don't expect to hear much about the trend. Traders
said the buy-backs are often kept secret, at least long
enough for the companies to buy the bonds while prices are
still cheap. That's very different from the stock market,
where companies routinely announce stock repurchase programs.
But then, the purpose of buying back stock is often to boost
prices, whereas bond buy-backs are designed to retire debt
cheaply.
   "We have such an illiquid market, that as soon as a
company announces it's buying back debt, prices jump," said
Kingman Penniman, senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti
&amp; Maffei, a Xerox Corp. unit. "Once you advertise that you're
buying, nobody wants to sell at low prices."
   On and off speculation that RJR Nabisco Inc. is
considering buying between $1 billion and $2 billion of its
junk bonds have kept prices of those bonds gyrating wildly in
recent months.
   Burlington Industries, a textile and apparel maker,
quietly repurchased junk bonds with a face value of $260
million for just $200 million -- a $60 million discount. Like
many junk-bond issuers, Burlington took out a bank loan to
get the money to buy back its bonds. Banks are often willing
to make such loans to corporate clients because the buy-backs
improve a company's financial health, investment bankers say.
   Burlington said the transaction resulted in a $14 million
net extraordinary gain to first-quarter earnings. Burlington,
which reported a net loss for the quarter, purchased the
bonds between January and March.
   There are signs, however, that bondholders are starting to
balk at the low-ball bids received from companies.
   "One thing that may slow down repurchases is bondholders
themselves, if they feel they are not being adequately
compensated," said Salomon's Mr. Bencivenga.
   On Wednesday, for example, Michelin &amp; Cie.'s Michelin
Finance unit said it was unsuccessful in its attempt to buy
back the junk bonds of its Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
subsidiary. Although Michelin offered to pay bondholders
premiums over current market prices, junk-bond traders said
investors held out for more money.
   The Michelin transaction differs from many recent
buy-backs in that the French tire maker made a formal, public
offer to investors.
   Most companies, however, quietly buy up their junk bonds.
Often, the buy-backs are initiated by traders on behalf of
large institutional investors that have been unable to sell
their bonds. Some money managers say they contact junk-bond
issuers directly and negotiate buy-back agreement without the
help of Wall Street.
