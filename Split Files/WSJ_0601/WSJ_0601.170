   ZURICH -- The Swiss National Bank effectively dashed hopes
that it might ease its restrictive monetary policy this year,
reiterating a commitment to firm interest rates and a strong
Swiss franc.
   The statements at the central bank's annual news
conference came as no surprise to the markets. But the
remarks underscored the Swiss National Bank's intention to
turn a deaf ear to domestic observers who would like to see
rates begin to ease as early as this summer to preclude any
chance of a recession.

   Central bank President Markus Lusser, citing continued
inflationary pressures in the robust economy, said "we
therefore see no reason to modify fundamentally the direction
of our monetary policy in the near future."
   He repeated the central bank's forecast that inflation
will fall sharply by the end of the year after reaching an
expected 5.5% annual pace in May. With the help of the strong
franc, the earlier fears of 6% annual rates in the summer
months may be avoided, he added.
   Nevertheless, Hans Meyer, vice president of the central
bank, ruled out the possibility that this will usher in lower
interest rates in the autumn. "I don't see any significant
change for the rest of the year," he said.
   Officials also emphasized the positive contribution to
monetary policy objectives made by the recent strength of the
Swiss franc, which helps to reduce the inflationary impact of
imports.
   "The evolution of the Swiss franc has been a lot more
favorable than we could have hoped for several months ago,"
Mr. Lusser said. He added that he "could live" with a
slightly firmer franc and doesn't see a danger now that the
currency may get too strong.
