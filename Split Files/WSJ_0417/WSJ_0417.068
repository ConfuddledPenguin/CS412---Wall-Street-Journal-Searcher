   NEW YORK -- For the 2,000 tourists who line up each day
outside its classic-revival marble facade, the New York Stock
Exchange is the U.S. stock market.
   But that's not necessarily the way it looks to Wall
Street. Power in the American market is shifting away from
small investors to giant institutions. As it shifts, the New
York Stock Exchange is under challenge as the central place
to buy and sell shares in America's big companies.

   Last year, the Big Board handled only 69.23% of the trades
in its listed stocks, a historic low. More and more stocks
are being traded on regional exchanges, such as the Midwest
Stock Exchange; in "dark markets" in London, where disclosure
and trading rules are looser; and in the U.S. "third market"
of private dealers and electronic systems.
   In addition, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures
pit in Chicago is the true most efficient stock market for
many institutions. Some days, the total value of stock traded
in the form of futures tops the dollar volume on the Big
Board.
   Big Board officials have known all this for years, of
course, but last Jan. 4 they got a real shock: A staggering
20 million shares of a Big Board stock, Hanson PLC, were
traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Officials of the
Big Board, which handled just 440,000 of Hanson's
29-million-share volume that day, "went bananas," one member
says. "They were screaming at subordinates, `Why can't some
of that business be done here?'"
   Another upsetting portent: In February, the
over-the-counter market grabbed 10.7% of the trades in Du
Pont Co. stock, a big jump from 2.8% a year earlier.
   The New York exchange "faces a serious and substantial
competitive challenge," says Curtis R. Welling, the managing
director in charge of First Boston Corp.'s equity division.
   John J. Phelan Jr., the Big Board's 59-year-old chairman,
concedes the exchange can't assume it will never lose its
franchise. "There are plenty of companies that have gone down
the chute who said, `I've got a product, come and get it,' "
he says. The Big Board "came very close in the '60s and early
'70s" to suffering from "that kind of attitude," and "we're
trying not to make that mistake again."
   This week, Mr. Phelan is expected to announce that the Big
Board's net income declined again in 1989 -- on top of a
69.4% plunge to $10.4 million in 1988. Consequently, the
exchange may have less money this year for paying top talent
and further expanding facilities.
   Since its founding in 1792, the Big Board has been the
place to trade the nation's major stocks. And despite losing
market share, it remains far and away the central
marketplace. It has long attracted more than 80% of the total
share volume in its listed stocks.
   By funneling most stock trades and information through one
central market, the theory goes, investors get the best
price. Each Big Board stock is entrusted to a single market
maker, or specialist, who constantly matches buy and sell
orders and uses his firm's own money to smooth out
imbalances. (The rival Nasdaq over-the-counter market relies
on multiple dealers, linked by computers, in each stock.)
   The Big Board's "auction market" system, its officials
contend, will save investors some $400 million this year by
getting them a price better than the bid or asked quote on
the specialist's books. And exchange officials insist that a
public market, regulated to ensure fairness, serves all
investors, from the $25 billion pension fund to the small
investor with 100 shares.
   However, managers of big pension funds, endowments, mutual
funds and insurance-company investments say the Big Board
hasn't been giving them what they want -- instant execution
on big blocks without moving prices sharply.
   "The problem with the whole market is that the
infrastructure is too small," says Bernard L. Madoff, who
heads Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, an OTC firm
that trades Big Board shares off the exchange. "There is too
much money out there moving around to be stabilized by a
specialist or a market-maker system."
   One sore point involves indexing, in which big
institutions shape their equity portfolios to match the
stocks in a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500. Indexing is
cheaper than stock picking because it minimizes trading
expenses, and it often produces higher returns. Since 1980,
the money indexed to the S&amp;P 500 has soared tenfold, to about
$200 billion. Last year, Wells Fargo Nikko Investment
Advisors alone managed $44 billion pegged to the index.
   With such huge sums involved in indexing alone, the Big
Board has become the playground of professional money
managers. Individuals still hold about 55% of all U.S.
stocks, but that is down from 80% two decades ago, and
someday, perhaps in this decade, institutions will pass
individuals as the biggest holders. Many giant funds say they
already are the stock market because their equity holdings --
totaling $1.6 trillion at the end of 1989 -- represent the
largest forces of active supply and demand.
   "The point has come where the specialists are having a
hard time standing up to the size of institutional
portfolios," says Douglas Holmes, vice president at Boston's
State Street Bank, which manages a $9 billion stock-index
fund. If computer-driven program trades, switching rapidly
between stocks and other financial instruments, beat down the
stock market, specialists' capital could be exhausted in
hours. "The expectations of liquidity are unrealistic in
1990," says Donald Stone, a Big Board vice chairman and
senior partner of the specialist firm of Lasker, Stone &amp;
Stern.
   Big money isn't the only threat to the Big Board. Wall
Street's slump, which began with the October 1987 crash and
has led to nearly 45,000 securities-industry layoffs, is
pressuring everyone to cut costs. Several big brokerage
firms, making little money trading stocks for customers, have
doubts about offering traditional trading and research
services. Instead, they prefer to trade stocks for
themselves.
   And, in a move that would have been heresy only a few
years ago, big investment banks such as Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
and First Boston are discussing whether an NYSE membership is
worth the expense, in light of the Big Board's paperwork
demands, its regulations arising from its role as a public
market, and the costly floor-brokerage fees. Some executives
at the firms contend that more money could be made by trading
directly with customers through their own trading desks.
   Morgan Stanley characterizes its discussions as simply
"what if" exercises. It watches all its costs, a spokesman
says, and "obviously a variety of exchange memberships are
among those costs, but the firm has never seriously
considered giving up its membership on the NYSE."
   First Boston's Mr. Welling says he believes in a strong
central marketplace for stocks and adds that the investment
bank will try to work with the exchange now, "though that's
not forever." Nevertheless, he comments, "every major member
firm has thought about" the value of a Big Board membership.
   Firms bypassing the New York exchange to trade on regional
exchanges or over the counter are hurting their customers,
Mr. Phelan says. He decries the rise in off-exchange trading
as a serious threat to stock markets -- and unethical.
   "People should not be allowed, for their own private
benefit, to step outside of that broad system, not just the
NYSE. They ought to be required to operate within that
national-market framework in which everybody has access to
that order flow and everybody can be competitive," Mr. Phelan
says. "The reason this country has had the broadest markets
and most liquid markets is because everybody has been brought
together and linked together."
   The Big Board asserts its system wins a better price for
investors on about one-third of transactions. Say that
McDonald's Corp., which closed at $32.875 yesterday, is
trading with a buying, or "bid," price of $32.75, and a
selling, or "asked," price of $33. Much of the time, the Big
Board says, the specialist can fill an order "within" the
quotes rather than at the bid or asked price. Thus, a buyer
won't be forced to pay the full asking price, and the seller
will get more than the bid price.
   But even securities firms that favor a central marketplace
criticize Big Board costs. Currently, an investment bank
faces an annual bill totaling $15 million to $20 million for
seats, membership fees, specialists' commissions and other
expenses. With the whole industry financially squeezed, says
Stanley Shopkorn, vice chairman and head of stock trading at
Salomon Brothers Inc., "If the NYSE wants to be the central
markeplace of the 1990s, they're going to have to address
costs."
   At Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the over-the-counter
department is making its own market for customers in about 50
Big Board issues, mostly closed-end funds. Though
acknowledging that the Big Board has improved its service,
Peter Da Puzzo, who heads Shearson's OTC department, says:
"Right now, it seems the bottom line is money, and we . . .
have to save that money." The Shearson experiment has sent
shudders through the Big Board.
   Alarmed by the erosion of the exchange's market share, its
officials are jawboning member firms about trading through
its system. They have mounted a multimillion-dollar
advertising campaign to convince investors that it's still
the best place to trade listed stocks. Late last year, to
lure back big traders, they launched the Big Board's own
500-stock basket (it flopped, hardly trading at all). And
they are trying to increase listings.
   Joseph Hardiman, the president of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq OTC market, says
the Big Board "has been making very aggressive marketing
efforts to lure our companies, significantly expanding their
cold-calling." In the first quarter, the exchange added 43
companies, raising total listings to 1,742 from 1,685 a year
earlier.
   And, for the first time, the Big Board plans to give
outside traders a thrice-a-day peek at stock orders pending
in the order "book" of each of its 46 specialists. It hopes
that opening the books will defuse complaints about the
specialists' monopoly on order information.
   Yet the move, scheduled later this year, won't
significantly aid professional traders and could hurt
amateurs, specialists say. Mr. Stone, the vice chairman, says
that simply looking at the order data isn't helpful without
interpretation by the specialist. "We will be buying
`sunshine,' but I doubt that anybody will profit by it," he
says.
   The Big Board is also trying to recapture orders flowing
to London and over computerized "crossing networks," which
automatically match buy and sell orders. It has asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to set up a
crossing system that would match orders at the closing price
after trading hours.
   However, critics say the Big Board could become irrelevant
if it doesn't move toward making active markets on a 24-hour
basis. They cite the Globex automated night-trading system
under development by a joint venture between the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC. The Big Board
is studying 24-hour active trading but says U.S. institutions
show little desire to trade all night. And Mr. Phelan insists
that however the exchange eventually handles all-night
trading, the public market must be maintained.
   Mr. Phelan during his six-year chairmanship and even
earlier pushed for what are now the exchange's essential
working tools: an electronic order-routing system, an
electronic specialists' book, an electronic link with
regional exchanges and an electronic express lane for small
investors' orders.
   As a result, the Big Board's daily trading capacity has
increased from about 50 million shares in 1980 to about 700
million. Last fall, during the market's Oct. 16 rebound after
the Oct. 13 "minicrash," the Big Board whirled through nearly
half a billion shares with hardly a hitch.
   To help beef up the trading capital on the exchange floor,
Mr. Phelan is inviting brokerage houses to buy specialist
firms; among those that already have done so are Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. But
brokerage executives note that specialists' profits have
dwindled. From 1985 to 1988, specialists earned double-digit
annual returns on their capital, but in 1989, the returns
slumped to 5.9%.
   Many institutional traders, though, say they are fed up
with the way specialists handle big program-trading
transactions. A large institution is said to have recently
asked Morgan Stanley to work on a project to facilitate
electronic trading among institutions and brokers and bypass
the Big Board. (A Morgan Stanley spokesman says the firm
doesn't comment on client business.) Experts on institutions'
other electronic-trading efforts see the day not far off when
about 20 of the giant investment funds will bypass exchanges
altogether and trade with each other.
   But Mr. Phelan maintains that eventually the clients of
index funds and other institutions will rebel against trading
outside the public markets. If the customers "really
understood that nobody gave a heck about price betterment and
how it was done as long as somebody made some money out of
it," he says, "you would have a revolution across this
country that would be absolutely unbelievable."
