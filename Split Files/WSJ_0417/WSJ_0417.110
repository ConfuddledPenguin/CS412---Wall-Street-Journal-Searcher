   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines withdrew a plan to boost
some air fares by as much as 23% after the move wasn't widely
followed by other carriers.
   Some analysts said they suspect carriers didn't imitate
the American increase because traffic, while improved, hasn't
been strong enough to justify such a large fare increase.
"There is a level at which the consumers won't fly, and
clearly the airlines are reaching it," said Paul Karos, an
airline analyst at First Boston Corp.

   Industry air traffic in March was expected to jump by
double-digits over the year-earlier figure, but it only rose
about 8%. Load factor, or the number of seats filled, dropped
in March from a year earlier. Those numbers, analysts said,
suggest that consumers, while traveling more, are getting
weary of constant fare increases.
   NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines said that's why it opted not
to go along with American's proposal. "We thought that at
this time of the year it would have a very negative effect on
ticket sales," said a Northwest spokesman.
   Improving demand already had prompted air carriers to
raise some ticket prices earlier this year, as well as to
tighten restrictions on tickets. American's increase, which
would have tied ticket prices more closely to mileage flown,
would have lowered some fares, but the overall impact would
have been a fare increase, an American spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Dallas-based
carrier withdrew the changes, which were scheduled to take
effect today. "In the current competitive environment, we
couldn't see it going into effect," she said.
   With summer traffic pickup right around the corner,
airlines are likely to be gearing up for fare increases that
would go into effect at least by Memorial Day, when demand
begins to surge.
   A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the carrier's pricing
officials were "satisfied" with the fare structure now in
place.
   Wall Street analysts, however, said the fare increases of
late should help the industry's financial results. They are
currently projecting industry losses of about $600 million
this year, compared with a $179 million profit last year.
   Although the latest fare proposal was withdrawn, analysts
said they were encouraged by the fact that American tried to
generate more cash with higher fares.
   "You're better trying to test the upper bounds," said
First Boston's Mr. Karos. "If you find the right fare level,
then you can squeeze the most money" from the traveling
public.
