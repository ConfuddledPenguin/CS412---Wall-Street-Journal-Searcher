   WASHINGTON -- Marriott Corp. said it completed the sale of
its Roy Rogers restaurant business to Hardee's Food Systems
Inc. for $365 million in cash, plus the assumption by
Hardee's of certain liabilities. Hardees is a unit of Imasco
Ltd.
   The Roy Rogers chain consists of more than 600
restaurants, of which more than 350 are company owned.

   Marriott said the sale would have no impact on 1990
earnings because proceeds are being invested in its remaining
family restaurant business.
