   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- National Bancshares Corp. of Texas
said a state judge here granted it a temporary restraining
order, preventing another Texas bank from interfering with
its recapitalization by trying to collect on a $4,950,000
loan.
   National Bancshares is trying to complete a
recapitalization with help from Equimark Corp. and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. But, it said, a special asset
bank managed by Team Bank on behalf of the FDIC has indicated
it might try to foreclose on three of National Bancshares'
most profitable banks, which were used as collateral to
secure the loan.

   In a news release, National Bancshares said the Federal
Asset Management Co., a Team Bank unit that is liquidating
assets for the FDIC, had notified National Bancshares that it
was in default of the loan as of Dec. 31. National Bancshares
said it had been negotiating an agreement with Federal Asset
that called for National Bancshares to repay the debt shortly
after its recapitalization is completed. But National
Bancshares said Team Bank and Federal Asset have acted "in a
manner contrary" to agreements and understandings of the
parties.
   A National Bancshares spokesman refused to elaborate on
the dispute, saying the matter is in litigation. A Team Bank
spokesman also declined to comment.
   National Bancshares said the loan is secured by its NBC
Bank-Laredo, NBC Bank-Eagle Pass and NBC Bank-Rio Grande
Valley. At March 31, 1989, those three banks accounted for
about 80% of the remaining positive shareholders' equity of
all the company's subsidiary banks.
   National Bancshares said the temporary restraining order
expires April 27, and it intends to seek a temporary
injunction on that date.
   Team Bank recently acquired the former subsidiary banks of
Texas American Bancshares Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, with
help from the FDIC.
