   CNB Bancshares Inc., Evansville, Ind., said it agreed
definitely to acquire Valley Federal Savings Bank in a cash
and stock transaction valued at about $11.4 million, or
$10.50 a share.
   In September, CNB agreed to pay $11.50 a share for the
Terre Haute, Ind.-based banking concern, but the company said
the purchase price was reduced because of higher interest
rates and other factors that have affected the market value
of Valley Federal's loan portfolio since then.

   Under the pact, CNB will pay $10.50 a share for each of
Valley Federal's nearly 1.1 million shares outstanding. The
company said 60% of the purchase price will be paid in the
form of CNB common stock, at a conversion value of $21 a
share.
   In connection with this agreement, CNB said Valley Federal
granted it an option to buy as much as 25% of its stock at
$7.85 a share under certain circumstances. Valley Federal has
assets of about $240 million and CNB has assets of about
$1.36 billion.
