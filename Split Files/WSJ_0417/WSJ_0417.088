   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $400 million loan
to Yugoslavia to help the country adopt market-related
reforms and expand imports, bank officials said.
   The bank said the Yugoslavian government will use the
credit to promote private-sector initiatives, seek to correct
price distortions in its economy, and "improve the allocation
and use of resources."

   Referring to the country's reform efforts, it added,
"Interest rates will be set at positive levels, a market for
foreign exchange will be established and foreign-trade and
domestic pricing regimes will be liberalized."
   The bank also is expected to approve a $200 million credit
to Hungary by midyear. The International Monetary Fund
previously approved a $598 million loan to Yugoslavia and a
$206 million loan to Hungary.
   The World Bank's loan to Yugoslavia, to be repaid in 15
years, will carry a variable interest rate, currently 7.75%.
