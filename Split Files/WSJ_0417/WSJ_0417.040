   For Auto Engines
                                                                                                       

   BREAKTHROUGHS in new materials for super-efficient auto
engines are emerging from a scientific race between the U.S.
and Japan.

   The keys to an auto engine that would boost gas mileage by
several-fold are exotic ceramics that could operate at
temperatures far higher than metals can stand. But molding,
pressing or punching ceramics into the variety of shapes
needed for engine parts is a major obstacle.
   So materials scientists are searching for ceramics that
are soft enough to be shaped when they are created at
super-hot temperatures. Once shaped, the ceramics would cool
to hard, wear-resistant parts that can undergo extreme
changes in temperature without cracking.
   Last year, scientists in both Japan and the U.S. developed
crystals of zirconium and yttrium oxides that are moldable at
1,150 degrees Celsius and might be used in 500-degree
applications. More recently, materials scientist I-Wei Chen
at the University of Michigan made a disk of silicon nitride
crystal; at 1,500 degrees, he punched the disk into a small
hat shape.
   Now Japanese scientists report in the journal Nature that
they've got a composite of silicon nitride and silicon carbon
crystals; at 1,600 degrees, a tiny piece was pulled to 150%
of its original length without any deformations.
   American scientists call the Japanese advance
"significant" but note the ceramic was elongated in only one
direction. To be shaped into useful parts, a ceramic would
have to be uniformly elongated in two directions at once.
Another problem: Shaping parts at 1,500 degrees or 1,600
degrees would require new materials for the punches and
presses. Ceramics that can be shaped at 1,100 degrees to
1,200 degrees may be the most practical, according to Prof.
Chen.
                                                                                                       

   `Cold Fusion' May Keep
   Earth's Core Molten
                                                                                                       

   AN OLD old geologic riddle may be solved by "cold fusion"
researchers.
   For decades, geologists have wondered why the Earth has a
molten iron core. The combination of heat from the formation
of the planet 4.6 billion years ago and heat from the natural
splitting of uranium, thorium and other radioactive atoms
probably helped melt iron, causing it to sink to the center.
However, scientists' calculations of the extent of this
primordial and radioactive heating indicate that it's not
enough to explain why the Earth still has a molten iron core.
   Physicist Stephen E. Jones and geologist Paul Palmer at
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, believe the missing
heat might be coming from the spontaneous fusion of hydrogen
atoms in the interior of the Earth. The two Brigham Young
scientists announced a year ago that they had discovered such
"cold fusion" in a laboratory experiment. The scientists'
version of "cold fusion" occurred at such a minuscule rate
that it held no promise as an energy source, and their report
was overshadowed by the more flamboyant "cold fusion" claims
made simultaneously at the University of Utah.
   To validate a theory that their type of "cold fusion"
could occur beneath the crust of the Earth, the Brigham Young
scientists are analyzing samples of gases from several active
volcanoes for byproducts of hydrogen fusion that might be
venting up from the Earth's interior.
                                                                                                       

   Drugs Hold Out Hope
   For the Incontinent
                                                                                                       

   URINARY incontinence, or "weak bladder," may be treatable
by new drugs.
   The chronic condition, caused by the involuntary
contraction of the bladder, afflicts 12 million to 24 million
Americans, says urologist Jerry Blaivis at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.
But few seek treatment, either because they are too
embarrassed or because they believe there isn't any
treatment.
   Some drugs that block the involuntary emptying of the
bladder are helpful in about half of the patients, but they
have side effects, and few patients can remember to take them
precisely on schedule three or four times a day.
   A new drug, terodiline, which needs to be taken only once
a day, is now beginning large-scale trials in the U.S., Dr.
Blaivis told reporters at a recent seminar by the National
Kidney Foundation. The drug, which is being developed by
Forest Laboratories Inc., New York, blocks the flow of
calcium into cells of the sphincter muscle. The calcium is
necessary to trigger bladder contraction.
   Another drug, DDAVP, which was recently introduced to
prevent nocturnal bedwetting, may be useful for urinary
incontinence occurring at any time of day, Dr. Blaivis says.
The drug, an antidiuretic sold by Rorer Group Inc., based in
Fort Washington, Pa., reduces the amount of urine that a
person produces, and thus should diminish the chances of
incontinent episodes.
   Meanwhile, surgeons are experimenting with injecting such
substances as collagen or Teflon to compress and support the
sphincter muscle, which controls the opening of the bladder
to the urethra. Preliminary results hint this procedure might
help patients who suffer severe incontinence as a result of
damage to the sphincter muscle.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FOXES gnawing insulation off cables in the Arctic were
thwarted when explorers coated the cables with a sealant
spiked with Tabasco sauce, a geographer reports in the
journal Nature. . . . English nurses on geriatric wards are
working in street clothes instead of uniforms, confusing
patients and doctors as to who's a nurse and who's a visitor,
complains the medical journal Lancet.
