   Torchmark Corp., Birmingham, Ala., reported that net
income, excluding realized investment gains, rose 13% in the
first quarter due in part to improved margins in insurance
operations and higher investment income.
   Net increased to $57.9 million from $51.1 million.

   Earnings, excluding realized investment gains, grew 16% to
$1.07 from 92 cents a share.
   Torchmark, an insurance-holding company, is waging a proxy
fight to install its own slate of five independent nominees
to the board of American General Corp., a Houston-based
insurance concern that it wants to acquire.
   Torchmark said realized after-tax investment gains were
$2.5 million, or four cents a share, compared with $492,000,
or one cent a share.
   The firm said revenue rose 9% to $437.4 million from
$400.5 million.
