   Tokyo share prices plunged in extremely thin trading
yesterday as a small amount of selling pushed down a broad
range of issues. Buying activity was low because the yen's
weakness kept most investors out of the market.
   Most European markets and some Asian and Pacific markets
were still closed for a long Easter weekend.

   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues dropped more than
400 points during the first 30 minutes of the morning session
largely because of arbitrage selling, traders said. The index
continued to fall for the rest of the day on selling by
individuals and investment trust funds.
   The Nikkei finished at 28463.18, down 750.74 points from
Friday's closing level, after falling 637 points in the
morning session. The index lost 409.28 points Friday.
   In early trading Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 187.17
points to 28650.35.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 230
million shares, the lowest level since the beginning of this
year. It compared with 330 million shares traded on Friday.
   A total of 871 issues declined, while 110 issues advanced
and 98 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 17.45 points Friday, was down 36.12
points, or 1.67%, at 2129.77.
   The second section index, which gained 9.40 points Friday,
was down 34.42 points, or 0.97%, to close at 3518.83.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at eight
million shares, down from 11 million shares Friday.
   Also, individuals who purchased stocks on margin last
November and December, when stock prices were rising at a
very fast pace, are approaching the end of the six-month
period in which they are required to settle their accounts.
   Approaching deadlines for settlement of margin buying have
begun to add to selling pressure in the market, observers
said.
   Haruo Ueno, manager of stock trading at Wako Securities,
said such pressure is expected to grow stronger over the next
two weeks as stocks that are required to be sold by early May
will be sold in April because of the holiday week that starts
at the end of April.
   Institutional investors remained on the sidelines
yesterday ahead of a series of U.S. economic indicators
scheduled for release later this week and Thursday's board
meeting of the Deutsche Bundesbank, as the results are likely
to affect the foreign exchange market, traders said.
   The dollar finished higher in quiet Tokyo trading, with
participants attributing the lack of activity to the holiday
around much of the world.
   Among yesterday's largest losers were pharmaceutical
stocks, which had advanced sharply last week. These shares
rose in anticipation of new products being brought to market.
But the companies failed to sustain gains as investors took
profits.
   Yamanouchi was down 90 yen to 2,940 yen ($18.38). Sankyo
fell 80 yen to 2,510 yen. Fujisawa gained 90 yen to 2,000.
   Also lower were high-technology shares such as Sony, which
declined 200 yen to 8,350 yen, and Fanuc, which lost 110 yen
to 7,080.
   Share prices also closed lower in Seoul and Taipei, and
were higher in Singapore and Manila. Markets were closed in
Sydney, Hong Kong and Wellington.
