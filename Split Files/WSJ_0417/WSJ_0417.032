   WEISSENBORN, West Germany -- As a cross-border road opened
in March through the rolling hills of Lower Saxony, Adolf
Luthin posted a sign by his farmhouse that read: "East
Germans eat and drink here for free."
   "They ate all day," says Mr. Luthin, whose land adjoins
the border. "Bratwurst. Yogurt. My wife's cakes."

   This once-sleepy village is snarled now with East German
cars. Weissenborn and a village across the border are
squabbling over who owns frontier beet fields. And one night
recently, a trailer crashed into Mr. Luthin's garden. He
awoke to find three men chasing after a calf they were
smuggling for sale in West Germany. "I am happy we are one
country now," says Mr. Luthin, leaning on a pitchfork. "But
it will take more than a shared glass of schnapps to become
good neighbors again."
   While politicians debate terms and timetables for German
unity, this border region midway between Bonn and Berlin is
getting on with business. Joint ventures are being signed,
bricks bartered for sausage, border fences cut up and sold.
And the thrill of first contact between East and West is
giving way to land-title fights, traffic jams and tension.
Viewed from here, the road to unification looks very bumpy.
   "We are a microcosm of Germany," says Werner Henning, a
Christian Democratic parliamentarian from the East German
border town of Heiligenstadt. "Rich Germans on one side
acting like gold panners, poor Germans on the other acting
like beggars."
   Heiligenstadt lies in a Catholic enclave of farms and
small industrial towns known as Eichsfeld, which was divided
by the postwar partition of Germany. For 40 years, a "death
strip" of mines and guard dogs cut off neighbors who had long
lived only a wheat field apart.
   Now that the border is open, Eichsfeld's old ties make for
odd reunions. Henrik Muller, 60 years old, hiked from
Weissenborn to the East German village where he courted a
woman 40 years ago. "She still looks pretty good," says the
bald, stocky farmer. "But she said I didn't look at all like
the man she remembered."
   Mr. Muller now drinks at an East German pub, where beer
costs 80% less than at home. East Germans often use his
telephone, a scarce and erratic appliance across the border.
An East German teenager comes across to help milk her new
boyfriend's cows.
   But the long divorce has created an awkward gulf.
Villagers on the Western border have trim, half-timbered
houses and tidy gardens, with Mercedes-Benzes parked beside.
A mile away in East Germany, rutted streets are lined with
rubble, and the houses are dilapidated. "The East still looks
like West Germany did right after the war," Mr. Muller says.
   Easterners crave Western tools and advice, yet can offer
little in exchange. And they resent what they see as Western
greed. Western farmers have hired lawyers to win back border
fields seized by the Communists. And Westerners flood across
the border each weekend to fill their cars with cheap gas and
food.
   Gerd Gasdorf, an East German, recently watched a West
German woman buy a butcher's entire stock, despite the
protests of other shoppers. On her way out, an old man
grumbled, "I hope you have a nice party." The West German
woman responded, "What party? This meat is for my dog."
   On a Friday night in Heiligenstadt, disk jockey Thomas
Fleischauer watches warily as East meets West on the dance
floor of a Communist youth club. By flashing Marlboros and
Deutschmarks, he says, male newcomers create the same
resentment that U.S. soldiers did after World War II. "They
come over here to play big guy and start fights over girls,"
he says.
   Easterners in the West are causing offense, too. In six
months, 800,000 people have streamed across to the West
German border town of Duderstadt, population 23,000, which
now has periodic smog problems. Commerce is up 30% at local
stores, but shoplifting also has soared.
   Easterners who stay in the West are straining scarce
housing and jobs. In Gottingen, a city of 140,000 about 10
miles west of the border, unemployment has leapt almost 20%
since fall, and a school gym and army barracks are being used
to shelter hundreds of homeless people.
   "We must help needy East Germans, but not by hurting the
needy here," says Gottingen's mayor, Artur Levi. As a Jew who
fled Germany during the war, Mr. Levi is sensitive to the
dangers of dislocation. If the burden of unification isn't
shared equitably, he says, "you could see violence on both
sides of the border."
   Many East Germans agree, adding that quick economic
integration between the two countries is needed to stabilize
relations. But uncertainty about property laws and currency
exchange has created a chaotic situation in which the old
system is dead in East Germany but the new system has not yet
been born.
   At a street fair on Karl Marx Street in Heiligenstadt,
Siegfried Rothenfeels is trying to teach his new neighbors
about capitalism. The West German beer salesman has hired a
local brewery to distribute his product in East Germany. But
he can't convince restaurants that stocking new brands might
mean profits as the economy turns private. "They just don't
have any initiative yet," he complains.
   A few booths away, a West German stand offering fancy
meats and french fries sits beside a plain, state-owned
trailer labeled "Consumption." The latter offers one type of
sausage and pre-filled cups of a hot wine called "grog."
   "The Westerners are trying to overrun us with their
machines," gripes manager Gunther Gerling, glancing enviously
at his neighbor's microwave oven and deep-fry pan. "But our
prices are lower, so we can still compete." Mr. Gerling
concedes that he doesn't have much reason to hustle; his pay
is based on a sales quota, and when the quota is filled, he
closes down an hour before the competition.
   Such attitudes carry over to work in West Germany.
Employers' initial euphoria at the influx of workers from the
East is waning fast.
   Angelika Gruber-Ruther, a Gottingen medical technician,
recently advertised for a maid, and many East Germans
applied. Most demanded extra money for a car, housing and
clothes. When she refused, "they tried to `guilt' me by
saying, `You've had everything for 40 years, now it's our
turn.'" She hired an immigrant Pole instead. "We've been
living apart for years, and suddenly we're supposed to
embrace these people," says Ms. Gruber-Ruther. "But they look
strange to me, they act strange -- they may as well be
Chinese]"
   The prospect of Western firms taking over inefficient
industries in the East worries many East Germans, who fear
they will lose both jobs and control if existing factories
are torn down. A visit to one takeover target, the Solidor
metallurgical plant in Heiligenstadt shows why their fears
aren't misplaced. The century-old operation is dimly lit and
cluttered with Kaiser-era equipment, such as wooden barrels
that rotate to wash and polish screws.
   "Every few months, the barrels break and spill all over
the place," says Klaus Anschlutz, who loads the barrels
manually. He and two other workers readily concede that the
factory is overmanned. "We just hope that any new owner will
fire the managers before they fire us," he says.
   Elderly East Germans also are worried, wondering if their
pensions will be undercut by unity and inflation. Yet it is
old people who seem most willing to overlook the blips in
reunification.
   In the East German border village of Kirchgandern, Clemens
Kloppner dragged a bench from his front yard to a perch
beside "Reunion Street," a newly paved road to a West German
village 300 yards away. Under Communist rule, Mr. Kloppner, a
78-year-old retired road builder, was only allowed to stand
beneath a nearby birch tree, and not for long because the
border was too sensitive. An adjoining cemetery holds graves
of those who broke for the West and didn't make it.
   Mr. Kloppner's son did make it, 28 years ago, settling in
a house within sight of his father's. He often watched his
father through binoculars. But if Mr. Kloppner so much as
waved back, East German guards stepped in. "Just looking at
the West was a crime," he says.
   Now, Mr. Kloppner walks across to see his son almost
daily. The rest of the time he spends on his bench, watching
prampushing parents, Westerners with cameras, and others who
enjoy the new freedom to stroll across the border.
   "We have been hiding behind our fences for 40 years, and
can't pretend that nothing has changed between us," he says.
"But maybe that will make our new marriage more interesting.
What we need is patience."
