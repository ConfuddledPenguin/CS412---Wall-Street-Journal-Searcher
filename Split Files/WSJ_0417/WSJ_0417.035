   Chemical Fabrics Corp., Merrimack, N.H., said a
Minneapolis jury found it liable for $2.2 million in damages
related to the construction of the roof of the Metrodome
stadium in Minneapolis.
   Chemical Fabrics said the jury upheld a claim that certain
panels in the roof weren't designed to contract
specifications. It said interest on the claim could amount to
an added $1.3 million.

   In a statement, Duane C. Montopoli, president and chief
executive officer, said "we believe strongly that neither the
finding of liability nor the damages awarded are supported by
the facts or the evidence presented in this case." He said
the maker of coated fiberglass materials plans to appeal and
is "optimistic that we will ultimately prevail in this
matter."
   The lawsuit, filed about five years ago by the Minneapolis
Sports Facilities Commission against Chemical Fabrics and
others involved in the design and construction of the roof,
centered on the performance of a snow-melting system, Mr.
Montopoli said.
