   Environmental Power Corp., Boston, reported its second
consecutive year of big losses and said its auditors raised
questions about its ability to "continue as a going concern."
   The developer of plants that turn waste coal and trash
into electrical power reported a net loss of $4.2 million, or
55 cents a share, compared with a loss of $4.7 million, or 61
cents a share, for 1989. Revenue rose to $583,026 from
$514,341.

   The company said the loss was partly due to $2.5 million
in reserves related to a former unit that is developing a
waste-to-energy plant in Galveston, Texas.
   Environmental Power's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, said in
their opinion that the company's ability to continue may
depend on completing financing of its current projects on
schedule or else finding alternative financing.
   Environmental Power said it believes its "arrangements
will be sufficient," but added that there isn't any assurance
the financing will be completed on time or on favorable
terms.
