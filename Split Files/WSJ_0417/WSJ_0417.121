   Surgical Laser Technologies Inc., Malvern, Pa., said it
expects first-quarter earnings will be lower than published
estimates ranging from six cents to 13 cents a share on a
fully taxed basis.
   David S. Joseph, chairman and chief executive officer,
said he expects earnings for the quarter will approximately
triple year-earlier net income of $62,000, or two cents a
share. The 1989 first-quarter net included a one-cent-a-share
gain from a tax-loss carry-forward.

   Mr. Joseph said earnings for the 1990 first quarter were
reduced by a January sales interruption related to doubling
the direct sales force to 27 people.
   He said results for the year are expected to be consistent
with analysts' estimates of 57 cents to 67 cents a share on a
fully taxed basis. In 1989, the company had net income of
$1.3 million, or 29 cents a share, which included a tax gain
of 10 cents a share. Mr. Joseph said he expects delayed
orders for contact laser therapy systems to be recorded in
the remaining three quarters. Surgeons have expressed strong
interest in using the company's proprietary technology for
gallbladder removals, he said.
