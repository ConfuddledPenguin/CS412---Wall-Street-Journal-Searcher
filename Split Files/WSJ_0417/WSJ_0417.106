   Texas Utilities Co. said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
approved the issuance of a license for full-power operation
of Comanche Peak Unit 1, some 17 years after construction
began.
   Texas Utilities, the plant's owner, said the unit is
expected to be at full power during the peak season of
electric use this summer.

   The NRC issued a low-power operating license in February.
Testing at low power began April 3 and was completed April 6,
the Dallas utility said.
   Comanche Peak, about 75 miles southwest of Dallas, had a
series of setbacks that included cost overruns and delays.
Its licensing process was suspended in early 1985 amid
allegations of improper design and construction, but the NRC
said concerns had been resolved.
