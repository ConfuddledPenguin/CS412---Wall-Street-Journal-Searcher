   Few cities have transformed themselves as dramatically as
Tokyo in the past century. It was only in 1867 under the
Meiji emperor that the city abandoned feudalism and opened
itself to an overwhelmingly stronger Western world. What
happened next has been told in numerous tomes that usually
focus on leading politicians, military officers and
industrialists.
   The merit of Edward Seidensticker's approach is that he
rummages through the basement of history, attempting to
decipher how ordinary residents of Tokyo lived through
momentous changes. An earlier book, "Low City, High City,"
covered the period until 1923. In this sequel, "Tokyo Rising"
(Knopf, 362 pages, $24.95), the author, one of our foremost
translators of Japanese literature, updates the story to
current times.

   Mr. Seidensticker has a talent for pithy observation. For
those in search of unchanging Japan, he advises a poorer
Tokyo neighborhood rather than a rich one: "Shabbiness does
not change, while the world of the rich and powerful seems to
change by the minute." One often hears that as a city grows
in wealth and importance, it becomes a more alienating place.
Mr. Seidensticker lifts the notion above cliche when he
remarks: "Almost all writers live in Tokyo today, and none
write of it as if it were home."
   But for the most part, his technique might be called
lunging for the capillaries. It can be effective when, for
example, he explains how the great earthquake of 1923 brought
about a Westernization of dress codes in Tokyo. Before the
disaster, department stores required shoppers to follow the
traditional practice of removing their shoes and donning
slippers. Customers good-naturedly accepted the inevitable
mixups when they tried to retrieve their footwear after
making their purchases.
   The specter of another earthquake causing people to flee
barefoot from the premises, or, still worse, to clog up the
exits while searching for their shoes, led to a typically
Japanese solution that balanced old and new ways: People
continued to remove their shoes before entering homes, but
kept them on while shopping.
   This sort of microcosmic approach works less well when Mr.
Seidensticker deals with the years leading to World War II.
He conveys little of the trauma, intolerance and xenophobia
of that era. We are told that popular singers who had taken
Western nicknames reverted to their Japanese names. Baseball,
we learn, was forced to pretend it was invented in Japan, and
American terms such as "play ball," "strike" and "pitcher,"
were replaced by Japanese words.
   More fundamentally, the reader is left to wonder what was
going through the minds of Tokyo residents when their
government vaunted the racial supremacy of the Japanese,
arrested anybody remotely considered a dissident, and sent
millions of citizens to kill and die overseas for the Greater
Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
   "There were many ways, chief among them, perhaps,
geographic isolation, to account for the fact that Japan had
no organized resistance and no selfless underground martyrs,"
notes Mr. Seidensticker. "In any event, it had none." Subject
closed. It's difficult to imagine accounts of Germany and
Italy giving such short shrift to the 1930s.
   With the horrific U.S. firebombing of Tokyo during World
War II, the book takes on the immediacy of journalism. Whole
neighborhoods are incinerated and parks are converted into
cemeteries. Four million people flee Tokyo. Among the three
million who stay behind, as many as 300,000 are homeless. At
the zoo, the carnivores and larger animals are put to death
because the government fears the bombings might free them
from their cages to roam wild in the streets.
   This account of wartime devastation gives the book a new
momentum that continues through the remaining pages.
Insightful anecdotes and elegant prose enhance rather than
replace narrative.
   Evoking the food shortages of the early postwar era, Mr.
Seidensticker writes: "In those days when the almost
universal way of transporting babies was by strapping them to
adult backs, a woman would seek to disguise her black-market
rice by strapping it. . . . and making soothing noises to it,
quite as if it were a baby. This woman's sack had sprung a
leak and rice was trickling out." A policeman, reluctant to
arrest the poor offender, taps her on the shoulder and says,
"Your baby is wetting its pants."
   Barely two decades later, Japan had emerged as an economic
superpower. People had become affluent so quickly that in a
1967 poll, 90% of Tokyo housewives listed themselves as
middle class -- up from 50% only three years before. Their
husbands' expense accounts have grown large enough to turn
Tokyo into the entertainment capital of the world. In some
districts, bars and restaurants outnumber residents.
   The Japanese, so fearful of Western superiority only a
century before, now wonder whether they have anything at all
to learn from the rest of the world. Mr. Seidensticker
suggests they might start by endowing their overbuilt,
unaesthetic capital with qualities befitting its new global
status. Citing the grandeur of New York when the U.S. was the
moneyed country of the world, and the harmony of Amsterdam,
Paris and London during their nations' periods of splendor,
he doubts whether Tokyo is headed for either grandeur or
harmony.
