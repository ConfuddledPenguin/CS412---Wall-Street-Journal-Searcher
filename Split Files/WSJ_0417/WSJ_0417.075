   The government's latest deadline to bring new charges
against Michael Milken is Thursday of this week, according to
individuals familiar with the government's investigation.
   Last month, prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood in New York that they would seek a new and expanded
indictment of Mr. Milken and others no later than this week.
The individuals familiar with the case said the government
has indicated it intends to stick to that schedule.

   Plea negotiations between prosecutors and Mr. Milken's
attorneys continued last week. But as of yesterday, Mr.
Milken hadn't accepted the deal offered him by the
government, said individuals familiar with those talks. Mr.
Milken is said to have been offered the opportunity to avoid
the new indictment by pleading guilty to six felony counts,
not including racketeering, and paying more than $600 million
in fines and penalties.
   In March 1989, a federal grand jury in Manhattan issued a
98-count indictment charging Mr. Milken, the former head of
junk-bond operations at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., with
racketeering and fraud in connection with securities trades.
Lowell Milken and Bruce L. Newberg, a former Drexel trader,
were also charged in the indictment. All three pleaded
innocent.
