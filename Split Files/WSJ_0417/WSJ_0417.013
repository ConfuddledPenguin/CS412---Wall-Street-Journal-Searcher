   VANCOUVER, British Columbia Woodward's Ltd. said it plans
to raise about 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34.4 million)
through an issue of Class A shares, and an accompanying
rights offering to current holders.
   Woodward's, a century-old department store chain of which
the founding Woodward family relinquished control last fall
to a group including Cambridge Shopping Centres Ltd. of
Toronto, said funds from the offering will be used to help
finance its turnaround program.

   Woodward's had a previously reported net loss last year of
C$59 million, or C$3.10 a share, on revenue of C$706.9
million. The results included special charges of C$17.2
million, or 90 Canadian cents a share, reflecting costs
associated with the layoff of about 20% of the chain's
full-time staff.
   Woodward's didn't disclose terms of the planned offering.
It has about 15.3 million Class A shares outstanding.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Woodward's
Class A shares closed at C$1.80 each, down 10 Canadian cents.
   Wood Gundy Inc., a Toronto-based securities dealer, will
act as agent for the offering, the company said.
