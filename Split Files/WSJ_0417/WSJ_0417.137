   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed mixed as a late wave of
selling offset an early rally, which was triggered by a
strong first-quarter earnings report from International
Business Machines.
   Traders attributed the market's sudden swoon to
futures-related program selling and profit-taking, reflecting
an advance in stocks beyond the upper limit of their recent
trading range and a downturn in bond prices.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.26 higher at
2763.06 after peaking with a gain of nearly 32 points. IBM,
which soared 3 3/4 to 110 7/8, accounted for more than half
of the closing gain in the 30-stock average.
   Broader market indexes posted only modest gains. Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.40 to 344.74, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.14 to 188.94 and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index advanced 0.38 to 321.11.
   Declining stocks led advancers by about 778 to 714 on the
Big Board, where the sluggish pace of trading activity last
week in advance of the Good Friday observance continued. Big
Board volume totaled 142,810,000 shares, compared with
142,470,000 Thursday.
   The session was "one of those days where the blue chips
are obviously leading the way," said Paul Hennessey, a vice
president of trading at Boston Co., Boston. IBM topped the
list of most active Big Board issues by a considerable
margin; more than 4.1 million shares changed hands in
composite trading.
   The Dow industrials surged about 29 points in the first
half-hour of trading as the market responded to IBM's
results, which were released before trading opened. The
company's first-quarter net income rose 9.2%, and its
earnings per share of $1.81 for the first quarter exceeded
even the most optimistic Wall Street forecast.
   But the market stalled following its early rally -- in
which the Dow industrials reached the vicinity of 2780 -- and
prices drifted until the late sell-off got under way.
   Program trading resulting from stock-index arbitrage,
which had contributed to the market's initial gains, also
spurred its retreat, traders said. Sell programs hit the
market after index futures dropped to relatively small
premiums to the cash indexes, making it profitable to buy
futures contracts and sell baskets of stocks.
   The pullback took place after bonds, which held steady
through most of the session, came under some selling
pressure. Among actively traded Treasury issues, prices of
30-year bonds fell about 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
face amount in late trading.
   IBM wasn't the only company among the 30 issues of the Dow
industrials to have a well-received earnings report;
Primerica advanced 3/4 to 30 1/4 after reporting
first-quarter net income jumped about 62% from a year earlier
and exceeded most forecasts.
   Several actively-traded blue chips also made contributions
to the gain in the average, including Philip Morris, which
rose 3/8 to 42 3/8 on 1.7 million shares; American Express,
up 3/8 to 28 5/8 on 1.4 million shares; and General Electric,
up 3/4 to 66 3/4 on 1.4 million shares.
   Even Aluminum Co. of America, whose first-quarter earnings
fell short of analysts' forecasts, moved higher as buyers
concentrated on blue-chip issues. Alcoa rose 1/4 to 64 7/8
although its earnings for the quarter fell 46% from the
year-earlier level.
   But issues of three major commercial banks dropped in the
wake of first-quarter earnings reports: Chase Manhattan
retreated 1 5/8 to 27 3/4; Manufacturers Hanover slipped 5/8
to 33 7/8, and J.P. Morgan eased 3/4 to 34 3/4. Net income
for all three banks declined from a year ago; Chase's decline
was the steepest, at 66.7%.
   Eli Lilly fell 1 1/4 to 67 1/4 on 1.5 million shares after
releasing its results for the quarter. Although the company's
net income jumped 19.7% from the year-earlier level, its
earnings per share of $1.16 fell short of most analysts'
projections. Just before the close, Lilly said its board
approved spending as much as $1 billion to buy back common
stock and warrants.
   TJX, which said it will take a $172.1 million charge to
establish a reserve against its stake in Ames Department
Stores, rose 3/8 to 13 7/8. TJX will restate its results for
the fiscal year ended Jan. 27 to reflect the charge,
resulting in a loss for the year of about $1.10 a share.
   Tambrands retreated 1 7/8 to 79 1/8. Prudential-Bache
Securities lowered the stock's investment rating to "hold"
from "buy" because of its recent price run up.
   Lands' End plunged 3 1/4 to 15 1/4 in response to its
latest earnings forecast. The company said it expects to
report net of eight to 12 cents a share for the quarter
ending this month, down from 23 cents a year earlier and
below its earlier projection.
   Public Service of New Mexico dropped 1 to 11 1/8.
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Donaldson, Lukfin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. lowered their 1990 and 1991
earnings estimates after New Mexico regulators ordered the
utility, among other things, to reduce rates by $2.9 million.
Public Service had requested a $1.8 million rate increase.
   Household International dropped 2 1/4 to 44 1/4 after
Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the company's debt
issues under review for a possible downgrade. The rating
service cited Household's "aggressive growth strategy" and
portfolios of commercial real estate and loans to highly
leveraged companies.
   Cincinnati Bell fell 1 3/8 to 23 5/8. The company said
that its first-quarter earnings dropped about 25.5% from a
year earlier and that it doesn't expect to achieve this year
the growth rate in net income and earnings per share of the
past two years.
   Bell Industries gained 1 to 15 1/4 after Donaldson Lufkin
added the stock to its list of recommended issues.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel skidded 2 3/8 to 8. Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., which owns a 34% stake, recommended a
reorganization plan filed by the company and a committee of
unsecured creditors that would leave current stockholders
with a stake of about 8.7%.
   Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust plunged 2 1/4 to 4 1/4. The trust,
which had defaulted last month on a debt issue, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.90
to 356.98. Declining issues led advancers 299 to 249 in
volume of 13,840,000 shares.
   Dataproducts surged 3 1/4 to 9 5/8 as 1.5 million shares
changed hands. Two Japanese companies, Hitachi Koki and
Nissei Sangyo, both affiliates of Hitachi Ltd., agreed
definitively to acquire the company jointly for $160 million.
   Landmark Land eased 1/8 to 17 3/8 after trading as high as
20 5/8. As expected, the company's savings-and-loan
subsidiary agreed to sell a large part of its real-estate and
resort holdings for $967 million to Barry G. Hon, a
California developer.
