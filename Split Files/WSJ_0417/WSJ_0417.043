   ROWAYTON, Conn. -- Baldwin Technology Corp. plans to
expand its printing-equipment manufacturing operations by
acquiring two subsidiaries of Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp. for
$44 million.
   The two subsidiaries, Misomex AB of Stockholm and Misomex
of North America Inc., Chicago, manufacture so-called
prepress equipment -- machines that, among other things,
impose images onto printing plates.

   The acquisition would expand Baldwin's lines of equipment
for the pressroom -- including presses -- and for post-press
processes, including machines for labeling, inserting,
stacking and bundling, said Kenneth W. Reynolds, Baldwin's
chief financial officer.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, 1989, for Misomex AB and Jan.
31, 1990, for Misomex of North America, the companies had
combined net income of more than $4 million on $40 million of
sales. For the six months ended Dec. 31, Baldwin earned $5.3
million, or 32 cents a share, on $83.4 million of sales.
   Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a closely held New York investment
firm, recently sold its printing-press business to a
subsidiary of an East German company, said John H.
FitzSimons, DKM's secretary and general counsel. "Misomex is
more valuable to a company like Baldwin, which is in related
businesses," he said. DKM has a number of remaining
interests, including real estate, oil and gas, and insurance.
   The transaction is subject to clearance by the Swedish
government and by U.S. regulators.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Baldwin's shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $8.625.

   BALDWIN TECHNOLOGY Co. produces accessories and controls
for printing equipment. In Tuesday's edition it was
incorrectly indicated that the company was considering
expanding into manufacturing printing presses.
