   Amdura Corp., which is operating under federal
bankruptcy-law protection, said it will solicit bids for its
main hardware distribution business, meaning that all its
operating businesses now are up for sale.
   The Denver-based company said it will solicit bids for
CoastAmerica Corp., CoastAmerica's related subsidiaries, and
Amdura National Distribution Co. Previously, the firm put its
two manufacturing units up for sale in an effort to trim
debt.

   The firm, whose management changed after a proxy fight
last year, sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code earlier this month when its
bank group refused to extend additional credit.
   Amdura said it has postponed release of year-end results
while it tries to resolve significant accounting issues
regarding the company's future. However, for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, it had a net loss from continuing operations,
reflecting the hardlines business, of $33.7 milion, or $5.14
a share, on revenue of $480.3 million. Including discontinued
operations, it had net income for the nine months of $3
million, or 20 cents a share.
