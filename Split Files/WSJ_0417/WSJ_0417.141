   Boise Cascade Corp. said first-quarter net income plunged
57%, largely as a result of depressed prices for its paper
products line.
   The Boise, Idaho, forest products concern posted profit of
$33.6 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with $78.3
million, or $1.74 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

   Revenue declined 3% to $1.07 billion from $1.1 billion.
The fall in both profit and revenue resulted from an 11% drop
in sales from the company's paper and paper products
division, which makes up about half of Boise Cascade's
revenue. The division posted sales of $572.4 million, down
from $643 million; the company blamed sluggish demand and
lower prices for most paper grades, as well as increased
manufacturing costs.
   In the latest quarter, the company had an average of 38.1
million shares outstanding, down from 45 million. The company
said the decline reflects a stock buy-back plan.
