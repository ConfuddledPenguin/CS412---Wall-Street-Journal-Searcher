   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp.'s official tally of
voting at the March 29 annual meeting confirmed that
management soundly defeated dissident holder Harold Simmons'
board candidates. But management fell far short in its
attempt to defeat three Simmons-supported ballot measures.
   The annual meeting was briefly reconvened yesterday to
formally announce the ballot results. Afterward, Daniel
Tellep, Lockheed's chairman, and Vincent N. Marafino, vice
chairman and chief financial officer, had lunch with Mr.
Simmons and his top strategist, J. Landis Martin.

   Mr. Simmons presented Mr. Tellep with a five-page letter
outlining the stockholder's recommendations for the company.
The letter apparently covered most of the issues raised in
the proxy battle.
   Lockheed declined to discuss the meeting and the letter.
   The ballot results, preliminary indications of which were
given by Lockheed a week ago, mark the end of a bitter proxy
fight. Mr. Simmons, a Dallas investor who controls 18.9% of
the nation's sixth-largest defense contractor, has said his
forces spent considerably more than $6 million pushing their
slate. Lockheed spent about $8 million.
   Lockheed said that of the 52.7 million shares voted,
incumbent Lockheed directors received between 57.6% and
60.7%; nominees of Mr. Simmons' Houston-based NL Industries
Inc. got 36.9%.
   However, three measures to increase shareholder rights,
one of which was proposed by NL Industries and the other two
supported by it, were approved with favorable votes of 54% to
61%.
   A Lockheed bylaw amendment to exempt the company from
antitakeover provisions of the Delaware corporate law won on
a 61% to 37% vote, with 2% abstaining. A recommendation for
Lockheed to adopt confidential voting procedures won 60% to
38%. And NL Industries' proposal that Lockheed redeem its
shareholder-rights plan passed 54% to 41%.
   Mr. Tellep didn't comment on the approval of the three
measures management had opposed, but he said "the decided
margin of victory for the incumbent board of directors gives
us a clear mandate to go forward" with current corporate
plans.
