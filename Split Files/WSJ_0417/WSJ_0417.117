   National Business Systems Inc. said shareholders approved
a recapitalization plan that includes changing the Toronto
company's name to Consolidated NBS Inc.
   The plan also calls for consolidating the outstanding
common shares on a 1-for-10 basis and creating three new
classes of preferred shares. It didn't give the value of the
new preferred issues.

   At last report, National Business had about 16 million
shares outstanding.
   The company said its noteholders will exchange 20 million
Canadian dollars ($17.2 million) of senior subordinated notes
for an equivalent amount of debentures convertible into Class
AAA cumulative participating preferred shares.
   The company also plans a rights offering which would allow
shareholders to purchase an additional C$20 million of the
convertible debentures.
   Hees International Bancorp Inc., which was retained in
1987 to manage and turn around the troubled credit-card
accessory manufacturing concern, said it will take any
convertible debentures not subscribed for under the offering.
