   KEYSTONE, Colo. -- While the field of AIDS research boasts
few breakthroughs these days, scientists at a meeting here
heard a report about a provocative French vaccine test, plus
a variety of new insights into treating the epidemic.
   The reports inspired hope that researchers might be able
to avoid the use of dangerous killed-virus vaccines, to find
ways to block transmission of the virus by pregnant women and
to evade the problems of toxicity and resistance to the drug
AZT. New treatment strategies, including gene therapy and
immunotherapy, also got a hearing.

   The weeklong meeting earlier this month, one in a series
of annual winter symposiums held by the University of
California at Los Angeles, drew about 750 participants to
this Rocky Mountain site.
   From the Pasteur Institute in Paris came word of what may
be the first protein-based vaccine to protect a chimpanzee
against infection by the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. If confirmed, it will be the first time
an animal has been shielded from infection without resorting
to a killed-virus vaccine. While a success in animal tests,
killed-virus vaccines still strike many researchers as too
risky to use in uninfected humans.
   Marc Girard, a vaccine researcher at Pasteur, reported
preliminary success in a test of two chimpanzees vaccinated
with "cocktails" of synthetic protein fragments. These
cocktails, though different, included a key ingredient in
common: a synthetic protein fragment that copies a part of
the AIDS virus's outer coat that scientists think could spark
a potent immune response. It's called the "V3 loop."
   Both vaccinated animals were then exposed to live AIDS
virus. Six months later, both chimps appear to be free of
infection, according to a lymph node biopsy and PCR
gene-amplification techniques. "Whether protection against
infection was achieved, however, will not be known until the
animals have been monitored at least one year," Dr. Girard's
report cautions.
   "It's great," responded Jorg Eichberg, an animal vaccine
researcher at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio, Texas. "Unfortunately, (the
Pasteur's approach) is a little bit of a hodgepodge since the
animals got different things." In addition to the piece of
the V3 loop, one animal got a shot of killed virus, while the
other animal's vaccine was supplemented by other viral
proteins. Also, he noted, the control animals, which became
infected, were tested at different times.
   The next challenge will be to unravel which ingredients in
the immunizing cocktail were responsible for protecting the
animals -- a major puzzle that obscures the meaning of the
experiment for now. "But it doesn't detract from his
success," Dr. Eichberg said.
   Wade Parks of the University of Miami said 33% of the
babies born to infected mothers carry the AIDS virus. He and
others are conducting a test of AZT in pregnant women. Other
researchers noted that all pregnant women may not be equally
infectious -- an insight that could lead to a different kind
of treatment.
   Hans Wigzell of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said
his studies of pregnant women infected with the AIDS virus
disclose that those women with the highest levels of certain
antibodies against the "loop" portion of the virus's coat
tend not to transmit the infection to their babies.
   Dr. Wigzell said he is laying the foundation for a program
to give passive immunization -- that is, infusions of
antibodies -- to expectant mothers. Dr. Wigzell added he
planned to discuss the approach with officials of the World
Health Organization. "The problem is that you probably need
(large amounts) of immunoglobulin-G," an expensive antibody
infusion, to shield the growing fetus until delivery, he
said.
   Several studies shed new light on the uses and problems of
the drug AZT. Douglas D. Richman, who discovered
drug-resistant virus strains in chronic AZT users, said his
group and others have narrowed down the cause of this
resistance to four precise mutations of a single gene that
encodes a viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase. Dr. Richman
said his lab now can screen patients using PCR technology to
detect which ones carry the resistant mutant viruses.
   The bad news is that resistance sharply curtails the
drug's usefulness after two years of AZT treatment. The good
news is that resistance doesn't extend to all other drugs in
the AZT family. Also, the new low-dose regimens and early
treatment appear to slow the emergence of drug resistance, he
added.
   The theme "less AZT is better" resounded even more
tellingly in the studies of Lawrence Corey of Children's
Hospital of Seattle. Dr. Corey said he stumbled on a
serendipitous finding while conducting a study evaluating
combination therapy of AZT and acyclovir, a herpes drug. The
combination possessed no special synergy, he found. But in a
group of patients with AIDS-related complex, or ARC, he found
the most effective AZT dose wasn't the currently favored 600
milligrams a day, but half that amount.
   To prompt a panoply of clinical improvements, including
weight gain, rises in T4 immune cells, reduced symptoms and
lower blood levels of virus, "the most effective dose of AZT
was 300 milligrams a day," he said.
   "The minimum effective dose of AZT still isn't known," he
said, admitting that his observation is far from conclusive.
But he said the findings call for a formal study comparing
300 milligrams of AZT with the current 600 milligram regimen.
   New strategies against the AIDS-linked cancer, Kaposi's
Sarcoma, or KS, may emerge from studies by Barbara Ensoli and
Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,
Md. Dr. Gallo said his experiments show that KS lesions grow
in response to the protein poured out by an AIDS virus gene
known as TAT. In the test tube, KS growth is inhibited by
adding antibodies to the TAT gene.
   Dr. Ensoli added that an anti-serum to certain natural
human growth factors, including interleukin-1 and basic
fibroblast growth factor, also curb growth of KS cells in the
laboratory. Dr. Gallo's team didn't indicate whether such
observations could lead to a practical therapy for the tumor.
Nor did he address his collaboration with a Japanese firm
believed to be developing an experimental treatment for KS.
Dr. Ensoli also declined to comment.
   Other groups developing experimental treatments were less
reticent at the Keystone meeting. Gene therapy for AIDS is
being investigated at the laboratory of W. French Anderson at
the National Institutes of Health. Richard Morgan, a member
of the Anderson team, said he is using animal tumor viruses,
stripped of their infectious powers and armed with new genes,
as a means of inducing human cells to produce a potential
host of therapeutic substances. The first such substance to
be spliced is synthetic CD4, a copy of the AIDS virus's
target site on human cells. Because synthetic CD4 can pose as
a decoy, sopping up the virus and sparing human cells, the
Anderson team is testing whether gene therapy could give
humans the ability to produce CD4 or other AIDS drugs.
   Robert Redfield of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
said he has used a synthetic-protein vaccine made by
MicroGeneSys Inc., West Haven, Conn., to alter the immune
response in five out of eight infected volunteers. Elevated
antibodies and immune cells were detected in the five
responsive volunteers, who also showed less decline in their
T-cells than the three who didn't respond to the treatment.
Dr. Redfield, who is working to assess prospects for eventual
immunotherapy, said the continuing trials show that patients'
immune response can be turned up without toxicity. In a
larger study of 30 patients, he hopes to "refine our
understanding" of immune regulation and disruption in
infected people.
   In another test, Joyce Zarling and her co-workers at the
Seattle-based Oncogen unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said
they are working with a highly toxic protein derived from the
poisonous pokeweed plant. The scientists experimented with
pokeweed antiviral protein, or PAP, and aimed it at human
T-cells (one of the virus's main targets) by fusing it with a
monoclonal antibody. The team reported the protein curbs
virus production by infected cells, but spares 90% of
uninfected cells. Because the toxin is derived from a common
plant, outside observers warned that activists should eschew
home experiments: Consuming pokeweed can cause a
leukemia-like condition that can be fatal.
   San Francisco physician Marcus Conant, in collaboration
with a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said a controlled study of
the immune-modulator thymopentin in 90 infected volunteers
slowed the disease process. Dr. Conant said the group
receiving a placebo experienced two cases of AIDS and two
cases of ARC, while the drug group had none. However, to
confirm validity of his findings, he said, "We need a study
in at least 800 patients." Given difficulties in recruiting
study volunteers, he said, that could be hard to do.
