   Dallas Museum of Art: "Gold of Three Continents" -- Nearly
600 gold objects, including jewelry, ornamental and ritual
objects from Africa (Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mali and
Senegal), Greece (from the Benaki Museum in Athens) and the
"Ancient Americas" (pre-Columbian objects from the museum's
collection). 1717 North Harwood, through June 10.
                                                                                                       

   Buell Hall, Columbia University, New York: "The Filter of
Reason: Work of Paul Nelson" opens this new 4,100-square-foot
gallery devoted solely to exhibitions about architecture.
Nelson (1895-1979) taught and practiced architecture in the
U.S. and France for more than 50 years and was a central
figure in the development of functionalist architecture in
the 1930s and '40s. The show includes more than 240 objects
such as architectural drawings, models, fine-arts drawings,
paintings and photographs. Of special interest are letters
representing more than 40 years of correspondence between
Nelson and Le Corbusier, Joan Miro, Fernand Leger,
Buckminster Fuller and others. Main campus, just east of Low
Library; use entrances at 116th Street and Broadway or 118th
Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Through May 11.
                                                                                                       

   SPECTACLE
                                                                                                       

   "The Music of David Arkenstone: A Multi-Media Laser
Odyssey": All the folks who've made this
composer/instrumentalist one of the most popular names in New
Age music have a new trip to look forward to. The hourlong
show combines selections from all three Arkenstone albums --
including the just-released "Citizen of Time" (on Narada) --
with dramatic visuals from Laser Images Inc., best known for
its work with Pink Floyd. Gates Planetarium (City Park,
Colorado Boulevard and 22nd Avenue), Denver, Thursdays

   DANCE
                                                                                                       

   Paul Taylor Dance Company: The puckish romantic celebrates
his troupe's 35th anniversary with a monthlong season at New
York's City Center -- and two major premieres. As usual, the
pieces reflect the choreographer's yin and yang: "Of Bright &amp;
Blue Birds &amp; The Gala Sun" is a meditative spiritual odyssey,
while "The Sorcerer's Sofa" is a rollicking spoof (of
Freudian psychology, set to "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"). The
engagement also features new works by company members Cathy
McCann and Christopher Gillis -- hers "Split Whiskers," a
witty trio, his a whirlwind for 12, "Curbs and Corridors" --
and the last local performances by the lithe and light Kate
Johnson -- 131 West 55th St., tonight through May 13. (212)
581-7907.
