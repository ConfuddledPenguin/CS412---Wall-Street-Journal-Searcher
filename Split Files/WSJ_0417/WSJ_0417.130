   CHICAGO -- The eight publicly traded funds spawned by
troubled VMS Realty Partners took large charges to cover
loans that might sour, resulting in steep fourth-quarter
losses.
   The move to establish the loan-loss reserves was the first
attempt by the funds to account for the damage done by their
relationship with VMS, a tie which the funds have severed.
The reserves announced were twice as great as those forecast
by VMS in February.

   The eight VMS funds raised $1.1 billion from the public
and lent the money exclusively to VMS Realty Partners. A
limited partnership syndicator, VMS last year disclosed that
it was facing a severe liquidity crisis.
   VMS Mortgage Investment Fund, which is traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, swallowed a charge of $151.2 million to
establish a reserve to cover potential loan losses. The
charge resulted in a fourth-quarter net loss of $140.3
million, or $3.53 a share. In the fourth quarter ended Dec.
31, 1988, the fund had net income of $6.2 million, or 30
cents a share.
   The seven other funds took combined charges of $240.7
million to establish the reserves and reported combined
losses of $205.1 million.
   Stock prices of the eight funds, which have been hammered
to levels well below their book value during the past several
weeks, reacted only slightly to the news of the
fourth-quarter losses. Yesterday, in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, VMS Mortgage Investment Fund closed
unchanged at $1.625.
   The funds, initially issued by VMS at $10 a share, were
sold by a nationwide network of broker-dealers led by
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The sales reaped large fees
and commissions for VMS and the broker-dealers. Lately,
however, the problems at VMS have led to a wave of lawsuits
against Prudential-Bache in particular. Attorneys
representing investors in both the funds and VMS-sponsored
partnerships, say they will seek more than $1 billion of
damages.
   The funds include five real estate investment trusts and
three master limited partnerships.
   VMS, which has been wracked by a liquidity crisis and
management turmoil, had estimated publicly in February that
five funds probably would have to establish loan-loss
reserves totaling $128 million on a combined basis.
   Since then, the independent directors and trustees of the
funds took control of them from VMS. Leonard G. Levine,
president of the eight funds and a former VMS senior vice
president, said yesterday that the reserves are larger than
earlier estimated by VMS mainly because the funds erased the
value that had been given in the past to certain guarantees
given to them by VMS.
   According to Mr. Levine, VMS had guaranteed payment on
several real estate loans. Because of VMS's financial
deterioration, the ability of VMS to make good on those
promises isn't clear in the funds' opinion, Mr. Levine said.
   VMS "can't supply our auditors with sufficient data to
conclude what the value of guarantee is," Mr. Levine said.
"So it is a zero valuation."
   In February, VMS stopped making loan payments to its
publicly traded funds.
   The funds also reduced the value of some real-estate
properties in which they have interests. According to Mr.
Levine, some construction projects had slowed or stopped
because of VMS's troubles. A number of the VMS properties are
now in negotiations with banks and other lenders.
   Creation of the reserves helped reduce the book value of
several funds by about one-third to one-half from their value
on Sept. 30, 1989.
   Mr. Levine said he doesn't expect the funds to
significantly increase their loan-loss reserves again any
time soon. However, he said it was "premature" to estimate
whether the funds might have returned to profitability during
the first quarter. The move by VMS in February to stop
payments to the funds makes results for the quarter difficult
to estimate, he said.
   Earlier this month, the funds retained the accounting firm
of Coopers &amp; Lybrand to make an independent evaluation of the
loans made by the funds to VMS, among other things. The eight
funds also delayed dividend declarations and suspended
distributions by the three master limited partnerships.
   Xerox Corp., an owner of VMS, said earlier this month that
it would take a first-quarter write-off of almost $400
million on VMS-related equity and unsecured investments and
loans.
