   JERUSALEM -- Israel's consumer price index rose 1.2% in
March, the government said.
   The price index measures price changes in a fixed
market-basket of goods and services. The state-run Central
Bureau of Statistics attributed the increase to price boosts
in all the items making up the basket, apart from clothes and
footwear.

   An increase of 2.2% was measured in housing costs, and it
followed a rise of 1.3% in February. Rents and home sale
prices have been pushed up because of a housing shortage
caused by an influx of Soviet Jews to Israel.
