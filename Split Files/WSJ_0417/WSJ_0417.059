   Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under Jimmy
Carter, in the March 26 issue of Fortune.

   The U.S. has been the global policeman, but I think
increasingly we will be the global air traffic controller.
You obey the cop because he will put you in jail. You obey
the traffic controller because you don't want to crash. The
world system still needs an arbitrator, and the U.S. will
play that role.
