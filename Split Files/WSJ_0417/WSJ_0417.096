   Bowing to employee and community anger over his retirement
benefits, Robert M. Price won't stand for re-election as
Control Data Corp.'s chairman.
   The announcement marks an ignoble end to his controversial
29-year career at the Minneapolis-based computer products and
services company he led.

   Mr. Price, who earlier this year relinquished the chief
executive officer's post to President Lawrence Perlman, had
planned to stay on as chairman and do consulting work for
Control Data.
   But the disclosure in Control Data's proxy statement that
Mr. Price would receive a severance package valued at more
than $5 million ignited a firestorm of indignation. Under Mr.
Price's leadership, Control Data had losses totaling hundreds
of millions of dollars and laid off thousands of employees in
a fight for survival during the 1980s.
   Local newspapers were incensed at the package. One
Minneapolis Star-Tribune business columnist characterized the
payouts to Mr. Price, as well as to previously retired
founder William C. Norris and Vice Chairman Norbert Berg, as
"obscene piles of cash." Mr. Norris received nearly $9
million to help finance a private institute, while Mr. Berg
left with a $3.2 million lump-sum payment plus stock, an
annuity and a leased car.
   The gilt on Mr. Price's parachute has so preoccupied the
company in recent days that Mr. Perlman met with groups of
employees to defend the arrangement. Control Data even set up
a telephone hotline to field inquiries.
   Yesterday the 59-year-old Mr. Price decided to call it
quits completely. "It is clear that under current
circumstances, my decision to withdraw from active management
at this time is best for the company," he said in a
statement. Accordingly, Mr. Price will resign as chairman as
of the May 2 annual meeting and won't be succeeded
immediately. Mr. Perlman will preside over the board.
   Acknowledging that negative reaction to his retirement
package figured heavily in Mr. Price's change of plans, a
Control Data spokeswoman added, "Bob Price believes it's
important that both he and the company put the past behind
them and focus on their respective futures. . . . This
decision allows us to focus on the present."
   Although the company had planned to use Mr. Price as a
consultant on various matters, at a cost of $1.35 million
over the next three years, Control Data now said it considers
that fee part of his separation. "We may call on him from
time to time," another spokeswoman said, as the company
sought to put more distance between it and its one-time chief
executive.
   The decision not to stand for re-election was a mutual one
between Mr. Price and the board, the spokeswoman said. Mr.
Price couldn't be reached for comment.
   In addition to his consulting contract, Mr. Price's
retirement arrangement called for a $2.7 million payment last
month, a lump-sum benefit payment of $1.5 million and 41,250
shares of company stock under various plans.
