   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- TJX Cos. established a $185 million
reserve covering its entire stake in troubled Ames Department
Stores Inc., leading to a restated loss for the fiscal year
ended Jan. 27.
   TJX holds Ames 6% cumulative convertible senior preferred
stock which it received when Ames acquired the Zayre discount
department store chain from a predecessor company. Problems
at Zayre have resulted in unexpectedly large losses and a
credit crunch for Ames.

   TJX, an off-price specialty retailer, said the reserve is
an effort to "put the Ames situation behind us" and won't
affect its cash situation.
   Meanwhile, TJX's board raised the company's quarterly cash
dividend to 11.5 cents a share from 10 cents a share, payable
May 31 to stock of record May 10. A spokesman said "our cash
generating capabilities are unaffected, which is why the
board saw fit to go forward with the planned increase in the
dividend."
   David Williamson, an analyst with Advest Inc. in Hartford,
Conn., said "now that they've decided to bite the bullet, I
view it as a positive." He added that since the reserve is
set against previously reported earnings, "it won't affect
their current fiscal year at all."
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, TJX closed at $13.875,
up 37.5 cents. Last week, the shares tumbled as the scope of
Ames's troubles became clear.
   TJX said that as a result of the restatement, it will
report a net loss for fiscal 1990 ended Jan. 27 of $78.3
million, or $1.10 a share. In fiscal 1989, the company had a
net loss of $167.8 million, or $2.97 a share. Before taking
the reserve for its Ames holding, TJX had reported fiscal
1990 net income of $93.8 million, or $1.43 a share.
   For the latest fiscal year, TJX said its restated income
from continuing operations was $75.7 million, or $1.16 a
share, including an $11.1 million charge to offset previously
recognized dividend income. In fiscal 1989, TJX reported
income from continuing operations of $55.1 million, or 98
cents a share.
   As a result of the reserve, TJX will show a loss on the
disposal of discontinued operations of $161 million. In
fiscal 1989, it had a loss from discontinued operations of
$223 million. TJX said the restatement won't affect
previously reported sales of $2.15 billion compared to $1.92
billion.
   TJX said its Ames holdings remain on its books, but a
spokesman said the reserve reflects an effort "to be as
prudent and conservative as we possibly can be."
   In addition to setting the reserve against the Ames
preferred stock, TJX took a $30 million reserve against any
other possible contingent liabilities. Those include a
contingent obligation for store leases, but TJX said most of
the leases are below market rates indicating they won't
result in losses. In addition, TJX established a reserve
against dividends paid by Ames, which had been of the
non-cash, payment-in-kind type.
   A TJX spokesman said that as a result of establishing the
reserve, TJX's shareholders' equity will fall to about $228
million, or $3.25 a share, from $401 million, or over $5 a
share. However, Mr. Williamson of Advest said that "retailers
don't trade on the basis of book value. Cash flow is a much
more important factor, and this {reserve} doesn't affect cash
flow."
