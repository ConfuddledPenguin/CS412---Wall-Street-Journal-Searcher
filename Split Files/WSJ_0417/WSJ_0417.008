   U.S. investors in Nikkei put warrants, a relatively new
investment that reaps big profits if Japanese share prices
plunge, have been sitting pretty through the Tokyo stock
market's recent upheavals.
   They also may be part of what is causing that turmoil.

   This is because the securities firms and banks that
devised the Nikkei puts, such as Salomon Inc. and Bankers
Trust New York Corp., often hedge them with complex trading
strategies that increase pressure on Japanese stocks when
prices are already falling.
   In effect, these institutions have revived the
computer-driven "portfolio insurance" strategies that were a
primary factor behind the U.S. stock market crash in October
1987.
   So far this year, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225
leading stocks that trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has
plunged nearly 27% from its record high at the end of last
year. On Monday, the index fell 750.74 points, or 2.6%, to
close at 28463.18.
   The fundamental reasons for the drop in Japanese stock
prices are well known: rising Japanese interest rates,
accelerating monetary growth, fears of higher inflation and a
general belief that asset prices in Japan -- both stocks and
real estate -- were overvalued. Waning confidence in Japan's
monetary authorities has merely added to the investors'
anxieties.
   Now a growing number of people believe that portfolio
insurance also played a part. While the Nikkei put warrants
weren't the cause of the Tokyo stock market's drop, they say,
the computerized hedging programs backing them exacerbated
the decline once it started and added to the market's
volatility.
   "These puts aren't taken lightly by the Ministry of
Finance or any of the groups in Japan," says a Canadian
investment banker who worked on some of Bankers Trust's
warrants. "There were a lot of negotiations with the
ministry. We got calls at two in morning. It was very
sensitive."
   In Tokyo, a Finance Ministry official says: "We can
imagine {the puts have} some effect, but no one can measure
them. We cannot trace how these products have affected the
market. We intend to study it further."
   Just how much the Nikkei puts have affected the Tokyo
market is probably impossible to quantify. Some of the effect
is muted by rules that require futures trading to close down
once prices move 10%.
   Nonetheless, "The psychological effect is greater than the
actual transactions," a senior trader at one of Japan's big
securities firms says. "The problem is that {the big Japanese
brokers} can't do it and can't explain it to their clients."
   Japanese securities firms, which lack the technology and
the expertise to do much computerized program trading, have
criticized U.S. firms in recent months for disrupting the
market by using such techniques. While the Americans don't
deny they use computerized trading strategies, they
vehemently deny that their practices contribute to the Tokyo
market's violent fluctuations.
   Four Nikkei put warrants have been listed on the American
Stock Exchange since early January. The first was offered by
Denmark and underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Co.; the others,
by Bankers Trust with one and Salomon with two, quickly
followed.
   The Amex-listed warrants entitle investors to a payment in
U.S. dollars, if the Nikkei stock average falls below the
exercise or "strike" price specified in the warrants'
prospectuses. Trading in the Amex puts has been active, at
times accounting for as much as 40% of the Amex's daily
volume.
   Other Nikkei puts have been trading in Canada and London
for more than a year, while private placements of Nikkei put
options have been available to U.S. and other institutional
investors since 1988.
   Combined, the publicly listed U.S. and Canadian put
warrants represent a roughly $3 billion bearish bet against
the Nikkei index, figures William Ziemba, a professor of
management science at the University of British Columbia.
Nobody knows for sure the value of the privately placed puts,
but investment bankers involved in some private deals say the
total could be about 10 times the listed warrants.
   To hedge the exposure on the Nikkei puts, the securities
firms and banks use a few different strategies, including
portfolio insurance, or "dynamic hedging," as it is called
now. This isn't really insurance; rather, it is a trading
strategy that sells progressively more stocks as the market
declines and buys them back as prices rally. The goal is to
limit losses in a falling market, but not leave the investor
too far behind when prices are gaining. Without these and
other strategies to hedge the puts, issuers would have risked
losing hundreds of millions of dollars in the recent plunge
in Japanese stock prices.
   The put issuers execute the portfolio-insurance strategy
primarily by purchasing and selling Nikkei futures contracts
on the Osaka and Singapore stock exchanges. The futures
provide a less expensive and quicker way to trade the Nikkei
index than buying and selling huge baskets of stocks.
   Traders say that even though dynamic hedging isn't the
only method used to back the puts, it could account for 10%
to 15% of total futures trading on volatile days. This is
modest, compared with the effect that portfolio insurance had
in the U.S. markets in 1987. But as these trades all go in
one direction, selling the market, at a time when the market
is skittish and volume is relatively thin, it is enough to
move the market, they say.
   Of course, because the same sequence also can occur when
prices rebound, these strategies tend to accentuate the
volatility of both stock market plunges and rallies.
   If dynamic hedging strategies continue to grow in
popularity in fledgling Japanese futures markets, the effect
on volatility could be expected to increase, traders say.
   As the U.S. market crash demonstrated, an especially big
problem arises when too many hedgers try to cram through the
market's exit by dumping futures at the same time. Sanford
Grossman, a finance professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School and an authority on the 1987
crash, says that dynamic hedging strategies typically "ignore
the fact that if people are engaging in the same strategy at
the same time, they'll affect the underlying stock price that
they're trying to hedge against."
