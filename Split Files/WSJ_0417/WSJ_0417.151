   WASHINGTON -- A National Academy of Sciences report
proposed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union work closely
together to explore Mars with robots.
   Eugene Levy, who headed the academy report, said he
envisioned a $10 billion project in which the U.S. launched
three "excursions" that would land robotic rovers on Mars as
early as the year 2000, dig for soil samples and return them
to Earth. The U.S. would also set up a series of robotic
weather and seismic stations on Mars. The Soviet Union, he
said, would be expected to launch three similar missions of
its own.

   Exploring Mars has long been the dream of planetary
scientists and government space officials world-wide. But
there is a sharp difference of opinion over whether
astronauts must be part of this exploration. Astronauts have
abilities to explore that machines can't begin to match, but
astronauts drive the costs to mind-numbing levels. For
instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
estimates the cost of setting up a manned base on the Moon
and sending astronauts to Mars early next century at about
$500 billion in 1991 dollars.
   Any manned exploration of Mars would be preceded by
robots. But Mr. Levy, head of the University of Arizona's
planetary science department, said that robotic missions
should be judged independently. "The overall social and
technological benefits of a robotic Mars exploration are so
large it would be a mistake to forgo them," he said.
   Robotic missions would require exceptionally sophisticated
machinery, computers and communications. NASA now is
experimenting with vehicles that use wheels or legs to cross
rough terrain, and have sufficient intelligence to avoid
areas they can't traverse. Mars is so distant that
controllers wouldn't be able to steer the vehicles from
Earth.
   The academy report said that robotic exploration could
best be accomplished by closely planning separate missions
with the Soviets. That way each country's robots could
explore different areas and the findings would be shared,
reducing the overall cost and expanding the scientific return
for both sides. Europe, Canada and Japan also would probably
participate, the report said, but on teams controlled by the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.
   The report recommended against a joint project with the
Soviets, however, in which the Soviets probably would develop
rockets and the U.S. would make the robots. A cooling of
political relations between the countries could doom the
project before it was completed, the report warned. A joint
mission would also deny each participant the ability to fully
develop new technologies, the report said, and lead to
worries about transferring valuable technology to a potential
adversary.
   The Bush administration has said it would begin talks with
the Soviet Union and other countries about cooperating in the
exploration of the Moon and Mars, but hasn't said what
structure it prefers.
   Mark Craig, NASA's director of exploration, said he
favored closely related, but separate missions with the
Soviets. "You date before you get married," he said.
   Returning samples from Mars could help settle questions of
whether life ever existed on Mars, and why Mars and Earth
evolved so differently. Scientists have long pondered what's
known as the "Goldilocks paradox" of planetary evolution:
Mars turned out too cold, Venus too hot and Earth just right
for life to develop.
   NASA now is debating which of several unmanned planetary
missions to ask Congress to approve for the year beginning
Oct. 1, 1996, including possible missions to Mercury and
Pluto.
