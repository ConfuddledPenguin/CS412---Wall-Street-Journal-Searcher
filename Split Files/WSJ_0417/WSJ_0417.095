   WASHINGTON -- Infighting among Washington semi-big shots
over a low-profile personnel decision has helped keep poor
people from getting affordable housing.
   It all has to do with the Federal Housing Finance Board,
an obscure entity launched last August as part of the $243
billion bailout of thrift institutions. Its mission is to
channel up to $100 million annually to cut interest rates for
lending to low-income and moderate-income housing projects.

   But that money has yet to finance its first home.
President Bush has yet to appoint the board of directors of
the housing finance board. Mary K. Bush, the person chosen by
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp to head
the board, has now been scotched by the White House. And the
administration has decided to make the board's job part-time,
a move that could strengthen HUD's control over the
theoretically independent housing finance board.
   It all promises to lead to further delay as members of
Congress consider looking into the Mary Bush affair and
challenging the switch to part-time status for the agency.
"This is just bureaucracy at its worst," says Mary Rose Oakar
(D., Ohio), a member of the House Banking Committee.
   Perhaps it was inevitable that a power struggle would
develop between two federal agencies dealing with housing.
And the outcome may have been just as predetermined: HUD is
an established, 13,000-person bureaucracy with a known
mandate, while the housing finance board is a new and small
offshoot of the troubled savings-and-loan bureaucracy.
   Pitted against Ms. Bush in this conflict was HUD
Undersecretary Alfred DelliBovi, a veteran federal bureaucrat
and former New York state assemblyman who learned politics
with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.). Again, the match-up was
uneven. Ms. Bush wins praise from colleagues for her
substantive expertise, but she can be politically naive.
   Last August, HUD Secretary Kemp invited her to his office
on the 10th floor of the HUD building overlooking the
Potomac. He asked her to become chairwoman of the new Federal
Housing Finance Board. The position carried an annual salary
of $89,500, nearly $100,000 less than what she made as a vice
president at the Federal National Mortgage Association. She
had known Mr. Kemp for several years and earlier had declined
his offer of a top HUD position. But she was enticed by the
prestige of a presidential appointment and the chance to run
her own show. She said yes.
   It didn't take long for Ms. Bush to make her first
mistake. She wanted to get the new agency up and running
quickly, so without soliciting bids for the work, she hired
outside consultants in November and December. The housing
finance board receives no federal appropriations (it's
financed with funds contributed by the 12 Federal Home Loan
Banks, which themselves are supported by their member
thrifts), so using non-competitive contractors is legal. But
it was politically unwise, particularly because three
contractors were associates of Ms. Bush, and because she did
it while HUD was still smarting from highly publicized
disclosures about favoritism and consultant abuse.
   If she had any enemies, she had given them an opening. In
January, they began to emerge. She already had picked a
career State Department official to be her director of
administration. But HUD's Mr. DelliBovi had his own
candidate, Patrick Pizzella, another veteran government
administrator. A month of meetings wore her down, and she
conceded.
   Mr. DelliBovi crowed over her defeat. At 10:16 p.m. on
Feb. 5, he distributed a computer memo to six HUD officials
on "Pat Pizzella's 1st day." The memo took subtle swipes at
Ms. Bush and then mentioned a consultant who was planning to
end his work with the new agency soon. "If he goes, let's
hope he takes Mary," Mr. DelliBovi wrote. He also told
associates that Ms. Bush isn't a good manager.
   Publicly, Mr. DelliBovi was saying that he and his boss
support Ms. Bush. "I want Mary Bush to succeed because Jack
Kemp picked her," Mr. DelliBovi says. He calls his memo's
comment about her an "intemperate remark."
   Then, last month, in an apparent attempt to embarrass Ms.
Bush, an underling of Mr. DelliBovi's urged a contact at
American Banker, a banking industry publication, to look into
the contract Ms. Bush gave to Wendell Gunn, a Stamford,
Conn., business consultant. That ploy backfired: Mr. Gunn is
Mr. Kemp's former chief of staff. The resulting publicity
about the no-bid contracts highlighted the Kemp-Gunn
relationship and left HUD officials scrambling to explain
that the secretary didn't know about the contracts before
they were let. It wound up with Mr. Gunn firing off an angry
memo to Mr. DelliBovi saying, among other things, that "the
secretary did in fact know I was being paid for my work, and
if you ask, he will tell you so."
   Ms. Bush may have won that round, but it was too late. The
publicity about her no-bid contracts had killed her chances.
Now Daniel Evans, the president of the Indianapolis Home Loan
Bank, who headed Vice President Dan Quayle's transition team,
is expected to be named as the chairman.
   Ms. Bush, who declined through a spokesman to be
interviewed for this story, recently agreed to stay on as the
housing finance board's managing director. Ironically, that
may wind up giving her more day-to-day power over the board
than if she had been chairman, especially if the board is
made part-time.
   Her nomination may be dead, but the trouble it created
lingers. A report by HUD's inspector general on her no-bid
contracts released yesterday cleared her of any wrongdoing.
But the House subcommittee that investigated the HUD scandal
last year is still considering hearings on them.
   Yet many inside and outside HUD and the housing finance
board agree that the contracts were only a public way of
fighting over the real point of contention between Kemp aides
and Ms. Bush: HUD's control over the board's housing program.
   It's clear HUD "wants to use the FHFB as an instrument for
its policy," says Benson Roberts of the Local Initiatives
Support Corp., a community development organization.
   HUD's Mr. DelliBovi acknowledges engaging in a "constant
tug of war" with Ms. Bush over her suspicions that HUD wanted
to control the board and over his desire to "aggressively
pursue" policies and programs that would lead to an efficient
and scandal-free agency.
   Ms. Bush doesn't want to talk about it. But a friend of
hers says the controversy has been "totally debilitating" to
her. "It has consumed her energy and her time," the friend
says.
