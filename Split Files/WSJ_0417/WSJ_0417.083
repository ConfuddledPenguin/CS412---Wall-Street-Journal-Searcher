   MOSCOW -- Lithuania would end up the clear loser in an
economic war with the Soviet Union. But Moscow risks shooting
itself in the foot if it carries out its threat to impose a
blockade on the renegade Baltic republic. As of last night,
however, the supplies cutoff hadn't begun.
   Soviet economists say sanctions are bound to be messy,
largely because economic ties between Moscow and the union
republics are so interwoven. Lithuania depends entirely on
many Soviet raw materials, particularly oil and gas. But the
Soviets also rely heavily on Lithuania for some products in
chronically short supply, including meat, milk, television
sets and socks.

   An economic blockade of Lithuania, "is not a rational or
well-founded decision," warns Albert Yeremin, an economist at
the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science's prestigious Institute of
Economics. "It will do colossal damage {to Lithuania} . . .
but it will hurt us a lot, too."
   In a telegram to Mr. Gorbachev late yesterday, Lithuanian
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene appealed for a
face-to-face meeting between the Soviet leader and a
Lithuanian delegation led by President Vytautas Landsbergis
so Mr. Gorbachev could provide details of the threatened
sanctions.
   In an angry letter sent to the republic on Friday, the
Soviet president had said he would cut off raw materials that
could be sold for hard currency on world markets unless
Lithuania by Sunday rescinded prosecession laws passed since
its declaration of independence on March 11. Eager to avoid
an all-out conflict, Prime Minister Prunskiene told Soviet
television that the republic is ready to compromise, and
warned of the dangers of "a cold and tough war." Mrs.
Prunskiene said the republic's leadership has instructed
enterprises not to withhold supplies they now send to other
republics, pending clarification of the measures Mr.
Gorbachev may take.
   The prospect of economic sanctions against Lithuania has
increased international concern about Moscow's handling of
the situation and threatens to tarnish Mr. Gorbachev's image
abroad. British officials were especially taken aback by
Friday's announcement because Mr. Gorbachev indicated to a
visiting British government minister last week that a
blockade wouldn't be imposed.
   In Washington, Bush administration officials, still eager
to avoid disrupting U.S.-Soviet relations, privately
expressed relief that Mr. Gorbachev's threat apparently
wasn't carried out yesterday. If Moscow has pulled back from
its threat, "Obviously, it's something that we would
welcome," said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler. "We have consistently said the way to go is
dialogue, negotiations, for discussions, for talks to begin,
not to escalate tensions."
   Quite apart from the political repercussions, such
unprecedented economic action could cause havoc to the Soviet
system, with its heavy reliance on central planning and
industrial monopolies. The Baltic republic accounts for just
1.5% of the Soviet Union's total output of goods and
services, and officials in Moscow say that it would run a
$5.9 billion annual deficit with the rest of the Soviet Union
if its trade were calculated at world-market prices. But the
figures don't give a true picture of Lithuania's economic
importance.
   Just over half of the republic's national income comes
from agriculture. Last year, it consumed just 60% of its
production of meat and milk, sending the remaining thousands
of tons to Moscow for redistribution to other republics.
According to Soviet statistics, Lithuania is a significant
supplier of refined sugar, potatoes, meat and milk to the
country. It has important paper and wood-processing
industries and is famous around the U.S.S.R. for its
clothing. Among other things, it produces 5% of all Soviet
socks.
   Moscow could make up the shortfall by purchasing these
products abroad with hard currency earned from the oil and
gas it now sends to Lithuania. But Lithuania's sizeable
electronics industry, which is vital for Soviet defense needs
and produces many household items for consumers, could prove
more troublesome. According to a recent study for the
Lithuanian parliament, the republic produces 75% of the
components for Soviet televisions, 30% of some tractor parts
and 100% of all household electric meters. It also has a
factory, possibly the only one in the Soviet Union, that
produces so-called black boxes for Soviet aircraft,
Lithuanian officials say. Black boxes record information that
is useful in crash investigations.
   Mrs. Prunskiene estimates that Moscow directly controls
about 45% of Lithuanian industry, particularly the factories
producing items for defense, space and other strategic uses.
Many of them are staffed largely by Russian workers sent into
the republic over the past few decades to dilute the ethnic
Lithuanian population.
   Soviet authorities thus face two major problems if they go
ahead with a blockade. The first would be to ensure that
industrial monopolies in the republic continue to operate,
especially those producing items for defense. The second
would be to protect ethnic-Russian workers in Lithuania, many
of whom oppose the republic's independence drive.
   Both tasks could prove impossible, economists say. "It's
completely unclear what would happen," says Mr. Yeremin of
the Institute of Economics. "What will the 20% of
non-Lithuanians do? I don't understand the sense of it."
   The danger of the Soviet economy's reliance on monopolies
was driven home earlier this year when a paper-processing
plant in the Baltic republic of Latvia was shut down for
environmental reasons. Its closure immediately prompted a
newsprint shortage that even affected the Communist Party
daily Pravda.
   For its part, Lithuania would be squeezed, perhaps
fatally, by a blockade. Its most vulnerable area is energy,
the cost of which is now heavily subsidized by the Soviet
government. "At present, local sources {wood and peat}
comprise less than 3% of the total amount of fuel consumed,
while 97% must be imported," the Lithuanian parliament report
says. But if Moscow shut off natural gas, it would also cut
off the Russian district of Kaliningrad, served by the same
pipeline.
   An unidentified member of the Lithuanian Presidium
interviewed by the Associated Press said Lithuania had enough
oil to power its factories for about six weeks, but only
enough newsprint to publish newspapers for four or five days.
Households would be among the worst affected because 80%
currently use Soviet natural gas for cooking and heating. The
Lithuanian parliament report calculated Lithuania would face
a $700 million bill for oil alone if it were forced to buy it
at world market prices. The republic has little hard currency
of its own.
   "If Moscow will ask us to pay for goods in hard currency,
we will agree," the Presidium member told AP. "But we will
ask for hard currency from Moscow for our products, and in
balance, it's not so bad for us."
   Lithuania does have a nuclear power plant, which generated
29 billion kilowatt/hours of electricity last year. But much
of that goes directly into the national grid, and may not be
easily redirected. Lithuanian agriculture is also vulnerable
because it relies on Soviet fertilizer and needs more grain
than it produces for fodder, according to the study for
parliament.
   "The Lithuanian economy was developed as an integral part
of the economic complex of the Soviet Union," the report
says. "Therefore the search for alternatives now is not
easy."
