   Resorts International Inc., struggling to emerge from
bankruptcy court, said it filed an amended plan of
reorganization that includes selling its Paradise Island
property in the Bahamas.
   Resorts Chairman Merv Griffin, who paid $365 million for
Resorts in a leveraged buy-out that quickly went bad, will
invest an additional $26 million under the new plan, as
opposed to $30 million in the plan announced last December.
As in the earlier plan, Mr. Griffin would get to retain 22%
of the company's equity under the new plan.

   The new plan also includes giving holders of the company's
$600 million in unsecured debt an additional $20 million
principal amount of new debt, plus equity in the reconfigured
company. The amount of equity would be less than under the
earlier plan.
   "The change sounds like a reflection of people's
disenchantment in owning equity in an Atlantic City asset,
which is a reasonable concern," said James Rubin, a principal
in Sass Lamle Rubin &amp; Co., an investment firm that follows
distressed securities.
   Other elements of the restructuring proposal announced
last December remain basically the same.
   A Resorts spokesman said he expects the company to emerge
from protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
by the summer. The plan must first be approved by two-thirds
of the bondholders and the bankruptcy judge in Camden, N.J.
   The latest reorganization proposal comes at a time when
the company's Atlantic city operations continue to worsen.
Revenue figures from last week indicate that the company's
Atlantic City property failed to capitalize on the spillover
from the opening of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino next
door. During the first week of the Taj's operations, Resorts'
revenue dropped 1.4%.
   In 1989, the company had a net loss of $303 million on
revenue of $451 million, compared with losses of $381 million
on revenue of $456 million the year before.
   Resorts' last restructuring proposal failed in part
because one major bondholder, Balfour Investors Inc. objected
to the terms. After negotiating with Salomon Brothers Inc.,
Resorts' investment adviser, the firm is said to be closer to
approving the new deal.
   "The offer has improved considerably since November, and
we expect it to improve further before consummation," said a
Balfour spokesman yesterday.
   The plan to sell Paradise Island is considered a major
concession by Mr. Griffin, who was known to covet the
property when he first sought the company. Proceeds from the
Paradise Island sale, estimated to be between $175 million
and $300 million, will likely be used to refurbish the
company's aging Atlantic City facility.
