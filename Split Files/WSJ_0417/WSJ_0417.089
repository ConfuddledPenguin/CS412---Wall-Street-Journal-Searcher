   PLEASANT HILL, Calif. -- Giga-tronics Inc. said slumping
orders, production delays and write-downs on obsolete
inventory would result in a loss of $250,000 for its fourth
fiscal quarter, ended March 31.
   The maker of defense electronic equipment earned $2.7
million, or 90 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

   Giga-tronics said that as a result of the downturn in
orders, it was firing 14 employees, or about 10% of its work
force. The company, however, called the staff reductions and
write-downs "isolated events" and said it expects to "return
to quarterly profitability in the near future."
