   COPIAGUE, N.Y. -- Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. reported a net
loss for the fourth quarter; the company said it expects
losses, which it couldn't estimate, for both the first and
second quarters.
   The generic-drug concern, which has closed most of its
manufacturing operations while an audit is conducted, posted
a fourth-quarter net loss of $9.3 million, or 43 cents a
share. A year earlier, Bolar earned $9.4 million, or 45 cents
a share. The latest results include effects of recalled
products returned in 1989, a $26.4 million reserve against
expected returns of recalled products in 1990, and an $8.8
million reserve for inventory not currently available for
sale.

   Sales plunged 89% to $4 million from $37.3 million. Over
the past few months, Bolar had recalled products that
accounted for most of its sales amid concerns about the
company's approval process and record-keeping. Last month,
the Food and Drug Administration withdrew approval of Bolar's
generic version of Dyazide, a blood pressure medicine. Bolar
recalled that drug in February, as evidence mounted that the
company had passed off brand-name drugs as its own to the
FDA.
   Bolar also is being accused by a House subcommittee of
using deceitful practices to win FDA approval for its drugs,
and the company is the subject of a grand jury investigation
in Baltimore.
   For the year, Bolar posted a 45% decline in net income, to
$16.8 million, or 78 cents a share, from $30.7 million, or
$1.51 a share a year earlier. Sales fell 12% to $112.9
million from $128 million.
