   CARMEL, Calif. -- Landmark Land Co. said it would sell a
major portion of its real estate holdings, including its
prestigious roster of golf courses, to California developer
Barry G. Hon for $967 million.
   Landmark owns the real estate through Oak Tree Savings,
its savings and loan subsidiary based in New Orleans. The
sale was triggered by new federal regulations which raised
the amount of capital needed to stay in the real estate
business.

   Mr. Hon, who owns Hon Development Co. of Laguna Hills,
Calif., said he wasn't concerned about the weakened real
estate market nationally. "Landmark is in the higher end of
the business so we're not as concerned as we might be," he
said.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Landmark
closed at $17.375, down 12.5 cents, on relatively heavy
volume of 342,500 shares.
