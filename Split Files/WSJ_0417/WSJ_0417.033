   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. posted
a 36% drop in net income for its second quarter ended March
31 to $173.4 million, or 70 cents a share, from $270.7
million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier, after a big
one-time gain.
   But operating income rose 4%. The aerospace, electronics,
automotive and graphics company's fiscal 1989 second-quarter
results included the gain of $104 million, or 40 cents a
share, from the sale of the Measurement &amp; Flow Control
division. Excluding the gain, operating income for the
year-earlier quarter was $166.7 million, or 65 cents a share,
Rockwell said. The latest period didn't have any special
items.

   Sales fell less than 1% to $3.15 billion from $3.16
billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Rockwell shares closed at $23.625, up 25 cents.
   Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company anticipates "modest" improvement in
earnings per share in the current fiscal year, compared with
earnings for fiscal 1989 before the one-time gain. Rockwell
had fiscal 1989 profit of $734.9 million, or $2.87 a share,
after the gain.
   "Our results for the {fiscal} first six months were better
than we anticipated when the fiscal year began," Mr. Beall
said in making the projection for the full year.
   Fiscal first-half profit fell 26% to $319.2 million, or
$1.29 a share, from the year-earlier $430.7 million, or $1.67
a share, including the big gain. Excluding the gain,
year-earlier operating income was $326.7 million, or $1.27 a
share. The difference in per-share amounts reflects results
of the company's stock buy-back program. On an operating
basis, the latest earnings performance amounts to a decline
of 2.3%.
   Sales rose less than 1% to $6.04 billion from $6.03
billion.
   Mr. Beall said the latest fiscal second-quarter results
reflect increased earnings in the company's electronics and
graphics businesses, offset by drops in aerospace and
automotive earnings.
   Rockwell's backlog on March 31 was $15.6 billion, a 24%
increase from the fiscal 1989 year-end backlog of $12.6
billion.
