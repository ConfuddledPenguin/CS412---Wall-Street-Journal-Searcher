   Axa-Midi Assurances and Hoylake Investments Ltd. requested
a delay of up to two months in regulatory deliberations now
under way regarding Axa's proposed acquisition of Farmers
Group Inc.
   Axa, a French insurance concern, said the delay would
allow time for "modifications" of its $4.5-billion bid for
Los Angeles-based Farmers. The move comes after insurance
regulators in California last week declined to approve the
hostile bid, citing the high leverage involved.

   The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith's #13 billion
hostile takeover attempt of B.A.T Industries PLC, the British
tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern that
is Farmers' parent.
   If Sir James's Hoylake succeeds in acquiring B.A.T, it
would sell Farmers to Axa. But any change in control of
Farmers needs approval of insurance regulators in all nine
states where Farmers operates.
   "This brief hold will allow us to adjust our transaction
to answer the concerns expressed by U.S. regulators," said
Axa Chairman Claude Bebear. "We are dedicated to relentlessly
pursuing our bid for Farmers within the regulatory process in
the U.S."
   A Farmers spokesman said, "It's our belief that the
problems identified by the California regulators with their
proposal aren't fixable. Axa doesn't have the size and
financial resources to acquire Farmers in a way that wouldn't
jeopardize our policyholders."
