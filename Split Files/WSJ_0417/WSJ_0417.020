   Your March 12 editorial "What's Up, Kim?" correctly
asserted that the discovery by South Korea of yet another
North Korean invasion tunnel under the Demilitarized Zone
symbolizes the threatening nature of the dictatorship in
Pyongyang and its "communist absolutism." However, it failed
to mention that, despite continuing high tensions on the
peninsula, some U.S. politicians and opinion makers are
calling for significant cuts or even complete withdrawal of
the 43,000-strong American troop presence in South Korea. The
U.S. should take care to prevent the euphoria over improved
East-West relations from distorting its perception of Korea.
   Pyongyang maintains a feverish military buildup and has
about a million soldiers, one of the world's largest armies.
The combined force strength of the U.S. and South Korea, on
the other hand, is about 700,000. The North deploys about 65%
of its military strength in forward areas near its border
with the South. In short, a strong first-strike capability
remains a high North Korean priority.

   Despite new and flexible diplomatic initiatives recently
advanced by Seoul and Washington, Pyongyang has refused to
allow progress toward achieving even basic
confidence-building measures such as South-North summit
meetings and trade ties. The North remains uncommitted to
good-faith negotiations and appears to approach inter-Korean
relations with one outcome in mind: the eventual domination
of the entire peninsula under the North's rule.
   Since the end of the Korean War, the deterrence
represented by America's strong political and military
commitment to South Korea has worked. The litmus test for the
U.S. should be a simple one: When the threat from the North
has diminished sufficiently, it will be time to begin
removing American troops from Korea. This approach not only
sustains adequate deterrence but also allows South Korea to
bargain with Pyongyang from a position of strength. Recent
U.S. experience in dealing with the Soviet Union gives
credence to this course of action.
