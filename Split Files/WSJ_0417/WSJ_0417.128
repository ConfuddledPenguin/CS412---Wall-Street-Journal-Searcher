   NEW YORK -- In a new American Express commercial, Paul
Newman outraces a souped-up competitor even though his
motorcycle goes only two miles an hour. Although American
Express might have done much better following the same safe
but steady strategy, say analysts, some on Wall Street are
recommending the stock.
   "The market is clearly nibbling at American Express's
shares," says Michael W. Blumstein, an analyst at First
Boston Corp. "American Express has a strong core business
because the cashless society is an unstoppable trend. I'd
even put my babysitter on a card if she'd take it."

   Analysts such as Mr. Blumstein hope that the worst is over
for a company whose consumer advertising and marketing
strategies have made its Travel Related Services company an
industry leader. Other American Express divisions, including
the information processing company and the IDS Financial
Services company, are also highly regarded and lucrative.
   Despite this, American Express shares are still well below
the past year's high of 35 1/4, primarily because of the woes
associated with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   "Shearson is the single biggest problem," continued Mr.
Blumstein. "I don't want to promise that there won't be more
additions to reserves, but I think most of the problems are
behind them. In a situation like Shearson's, you want to
write off as much as possible."
   By agreeing to ante up $1.05 billion to strengthen
Shearson Lehman Hutton, argue the optimists, American Express
probably won't earn much more than 70 cents to 90 cents a
share this year. What's more important, they insist, is the
notion that American Express has positioned itself for a
strong and profitable 1991.
   "You can't say outright that all of the Shearson problems
are over, because there are still concerns about Shearson's
$500 million bridge loan to Prime Computer; its investment in
First Capital Holdings, a life insurance company, and the
Balcor real estate subsidiary," says Michael Lewis, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Still, American
Express's TRS division is one of the great franchises. This
is a stock you have to be willing to live with for a year. If
you do, the returns will be there."
   Others investors appear to agree. Yesterday in heavy
trading, American Express moved as high as 29 before closing
at 28 5/8, up 3/8 for the day. With volume exceeding 1.4
million shares, the stock was the day's sixth most active.
   "We're recommending the stock on the basis that Shearson
is a wash," says Michael Frinquelli, a Salomon Brothers
analyst. "Their other businesses are really crown jewels."
   Analysts such as Mr. Frinquelli think American Express
will earn at least $3.15 a share in 1991, with future
earnings growth goals of 12% to 15%. Valued at a conservative
11 times those 1991 earnings, the shares would be in the
neighborhood of 35, which is 22% higher than now.
   "I can't imagine that Shearson will have another write-off
to match that of the first quarter," added Mr. Frinquelli.
For the first quarter, Shearson has estimated that it will
report a loss of $897 million to $917 million, largely from
one-time charges. "There may well be other Shearson-related
problems, but I'm assuming they will be worked out."
   Because of its Shearson injection, American Express will
add to its own equity capital by generating $750 million
either publicly, by issuing more shares, or privately,
perhaps through a convertible preferred stock. Analysts hope
that at least part of the sum will be raised privately to
avoid diluting the interests of current stockholders.
   Most analysts believe that if a public offering is
necessary, American Express will issue 30 million to 40
million new shares.
   "It's a concern of sorts," says Mr. Frinquelli of Salomon.
"I certainly hope it's not going to be all public money.
However, even if they do go to the public for the entire
amount, I still think the company will earn at least $3.15 in
1991."
   American Express has had something of a roller coaster
past in recent years, and at least one analyst has decided
against issuing a "buy" recommendation despite her belief
that the company appears to have good long-term prospects.
   "It looks like a good value at $28 or $29," says Gloria
Vogel, an analyst with Bear Stearns. "However, I want to see
how the company raises that $750 million it needs. Also, I'm
still a little concerned about Shearson. Nobody knows where
the retail {small-investor} market is going, although it's
clearly not good. When it comes to Shearson, I don't think
anybody really knows whether the worst is over."
