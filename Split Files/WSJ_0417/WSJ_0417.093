   NEW YORK -- A growing group of fledgling Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. brokers are fuming over having to hawk stocks
alongside socks at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. stores, claiming they
were never told they'd have to put in their time at the
retail outlets.
   Since 1981, when Sears bought Dean Witter, many of the
firm's brokers have been required to spend time at Sears
stores, trying to sell stocks and other investments to Sears
customers shopping for the clothing, vacuum cleaners and
other goods the big retailer sells.

   A Dean Witter spokesman says all trainees are told in
advance that they have to spend time in a Sears store. "It's
an opportunity for them to sit down and see some people face
to face," the spokesman says.
   But more than a dozen broker trainees and former brokers
at Dean Witter contend they never were told about that
requirement.
   About 28 of the approximately 75 broker trainees at Dean
Witter's World Trade Center office here have resigned in the
past year alone, Dean Witter concedes; that is the highest
annual turnover since the office opened in 1986. The brokers
complain of being required to travel to distant locations
several times a month to man Dean Witter booths that generate
measly amounts of business -- and thus less take-home pay.
   "I wish I would have been advised up front," says Robert
Rubino, who recently transferred from the New York office to
work out of Dean Witter's Phoenix, Ariz., branch. "I didn't
get a thing out of {the Sears stores.}"
   Many former Dean Witter brokers were afraid to talk on the
record; they say their contract holds them liable for $28,000
in training fees that the firm theoretically can ask them for
if they haven't put in three years at the firm.
   Turnover among broker-trainees typically is high at all
firms, of course. And with many small individuals shying from
stocks and other investments, business has been tough for
even the most seasoned brokers. But some of the trainees say
their experience shows that ethics on Wall Street start at
the front door.
   "A lack of ethics begins at the entry level, and festers
into other areas," says one Dean Witter broker who requested
anonymity.
   Until last July, Dean Witter had booths in about 320 of
the 847 Sears stores nationwide. Since then, however, the
firm has cut down that number to just 100 outlets that Dean
Witter managers and brokers specifically requested to keep
open for brokerage business.
   As a group, the brokerage operations at the Sears stores
are profitable, a Dean Witter spokesman says, although he
wouldn't provide a breakdown. For 1989, Dean Witter's
securities-related business reported earnings of $100.2
million, a 59% jump from a year earlier.
   Despite assurances from Dean Witter executives, many
fledgling brokers say they can't drum up much business at
Sears; they say they wouldn't have started at the firm had
they known of the commitment. The brokers typically are
picked at random to spend several days a month at various
Sears outlets.
   One former broker says she was embarrassed to call clients
from Sears. She recalls trying to do business last Christmas
season from the Dean Witter booth in the Sears store in
Staten Island, N.Y., which is just across from the children's
section. "A Disney video was blasting and all I kept hearing
was `Up, Up and Away,'" the former broker says. "It sounded
like I was calling from my house with the kids screaming in
the background."
   Other brokers grouse about not getting any business. One
recalls one jumbo sale -- a $265,000 order from one customer
-- but says: "Plenty of times I went in and it was a waste of
time." The brokers complain that they are at a disadvantage
at Sears because they often lack access to basic reference
materials available at their desks.
   Having access to stock quotes at some Sears stores was
little consolation for some former brokers. "I had people
come in and ask me to punch up stock prices on the Quotron,
that's about it," says Alex Resnick, a former broker now at
Mitsubishi Bank. Customers also would ask him to deliver
checks to other Dean Witter brokers -- "like a messenger,"
Mr. Resnick says.
   Several brokers, moreover, say they were promised by Dean
Witter's personnel department that they would receive a
guaranteed salary for 12 months, only to find that the
guarantee only lasted for six months.
   "If they had told me I would have had to go to Sears and
only get a six-month draw, I never would have started there,"
says Mr. Resnick.
   Some Dean Witter brokers and former brokers say sluggish
small-investor activity has brought the Sears problem to a
head. Steven Roitman, a former Dean Witter trainee, says "If
we were all making $150,000, it would have been something we
could overlook."
   Mr. Rubino, the Phoenix broker, agrees that being required
to work at Sears outlets would be acceptable in a strong bull
market, with investors clamoring to open accounts. "The
concept is good," Mr. Rubino says. "The timing is wrong."
   The brouhaha isn't the first between Dean Witter brokers
and Sears. Last August, many of Dean Witter's 8,000 brokers
complained about Sears's Prodigy venture, an electronic
home-shopping system that also lets users trade stocks and
other investments. The brokers said Prodigy undercut them
because the system charged a fraction of the commissions
charged by Dean Witter brokers.
