   International American Homes Inc. said it filed for
protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The Clark, N.J.-based company builds and sells houses
through its subsidiaries and related partnerships, which also
have filed Chapter 11 petitions. International American Homes
operates in the Washington, D.C., area as well as in parts of
California and Florida.

   The company said the filing was to give it time to respond
to a cash shortage caused by a significant reduction in home
and land sales, and the loss of anticipated financing that
occurred from changes in banking regulations.
   Officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   In February, one of the company's affiliated partnerships
defaulted on bank loans, and a unit was late in paying
interest on a "substantial bank facility." At the time,
International American said the events were likely to hurt
its current loan arrangements and that it planned to
restructure itself into a smaller operation.
   International American had a loss in its third quarter
ended Dec. 31 of $7.6 million, or $1.07 a share, on revenue
of $43.1 million.
