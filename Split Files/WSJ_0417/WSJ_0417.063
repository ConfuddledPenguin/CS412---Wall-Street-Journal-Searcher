   PITTSBURGH -- Centaur Partners Group said holders of 54%
of National Intergroup Inc.'s shares backed the group's
proposal to expand the company's board to 15 from 12.
   However, company bylaws require 80% support to change the
current board number. Centaur, which holds a 16.5% stake in
National Intergroup, has asked the Delaware Supreme Court to
rule that only a simple majority be required to change the
bylaws. Should Centaur prevail, stockholders would elect
eight directors at this year's annual meeting in July.

   Centaur said the vote indicated that a majority of
stockholders have issued an "overwhelming mandate regarding
the future of NII." Furthermore, the investor group said it
believes the company should be swayed by the majority to
reduce to 45 days the advance notice of director nominees. As
a result, Centaur said it would forward a written notice
containing its eight nominees for election at the 1990 annual
meeting.
   However, National Intergroup, a steel, drug-distribution
and retail concern, said Centaur failed to receive the
necessary support to "pack the NII board." Moreover, the
company noted that only 29% of the company's 21.8 million
shares outstanding, excluding the 25% owned by the Centaur
Group and another dissident group, Walker Street Associates,
backed the move.
   "These numbers indicate that the dissidents received the
support of substantially less than a majority of the
independent shareholders," the company noted. The current
board structure was approved by National Intergroup
shareholders in 1984.
   The company last week filed suit asking that Centaur and
Walker Street Associates be forced to divest themselves of
their holdings. The lawsuit alleges that the two groups have
made materially false and misleading statements in their
solicitation of proxies and are acting together as a group.
Centaur denied the allegations and Walker didn't comment on
them.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
National Intergroup closed at $16, up 12.5 cents.
