   NEW YORK -- Sugar futures prices sank in thin trading that
was caused partly by the London market remaining closed
yesterday for the Easter holiday.
   July sugar fell 0.35 cent a pound to settle at 15.20
cents, only 0.01 cent above the day's low. The contract had
opened 0.02 cent under Thursday's close, but quickly sank as
local traders sold contracts.

   There was no news concerning sales of physical sugar in
the world market, according to Judith Ganes, senior soft
commodity specialist at Merrill Lynch in New York. She noted
that physical supplies remain tight and that Mexico in recent
weeks has been a buyer and will probably do more buying in
the weeks to come.
   In March, sugar prices rose to a 15-year high on the
possibility that this year's European sugar beet crop is
going to be smaller than first expected. F.O. Licht, the West
German sugar statistical company, estimated that the total
European sugar beet plantings this season would amount to 7.1
million hectares, up 99,000 hectares from last year but
smaller than the 150,000 hectare increase that was expected.
A hectare is equivalent to 2.47 acres.
   In March, the July contract reached 16.10 cents a pound.
That was only the second time in the past eight years in
which July sugar had exceeded 15 cents a pound. The previous
occurrence was in July 1988 when the contract rose to 15.64
cents before running out of steam. Prior to that sugar
reached 15 cents in August 1981.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department in its recent Sugar and
Sweeteners report estimated world sugar production for the
1989-90 crop year at 105.2 million metric tons, 500,000 tons
less than its December estimate. The department forecast
consumption at 108.5 million metric tons, marginally above
its December estimate.
   The department also said that stocks on hand when the
season began Sept. 1 were expected to shrink to 28.5 million
metric tons -- one million tons below a year earlier and the
lowest stock level since 1980-81. This will be the fifth
consecutive year in which sugar production will fall short of
consumption. The sugar crop year begins Sept. 1.
   The Agriculture Department said production declines in the
U.S., Mexico, Cuba and Thailand would outweigh improved
prospects in the European Community, Soviet Union, Indonesia
and Yugoslavia.
   Yesterday's decline was in line with historical trends
researched by Pacific Research Center, a company in Eugene,
Ore., that analyzes commodities. In an historical study of
daily prices for the nearby or "spot" sugar contract, Pacific
Research found that from 1966 through 1989 sugar prices
closed lower on 52% of the Mondays and Tuesdays. The study
showed that sugar closed unchanged about 4% of the time.
   Over the same period, sugar has had an average daily price
range of 0.37 cent, or $417 a contract. The daily price range
is calculated by subtracting the day's low price from the
day's high price. From 1968 through 1971 the sugar contract
averaged about a 0.09 cent daily price range. The range
expanded to about 0.32 cent in 1972 and 1973.
   Then in the fall of 1974 sugar prices exploded upward,
reaching a high of 66 cents a pound before collapsing. That
year sugar had an average daily range of 1.25 cents, or
$1,396 a contract. Sugar rallied to 45 cents a pound in the
fall of 1980, and that year had an average daily range of
1.45 cents a pound or $1,629 a contract.
   Sugar has exhibited a similar pattern in recent years with
an average daily range of about 0.23 cent a pound from 1984
through 1987. In 1988 and 1989 the daily range expanded to
0.42 cent a pound.
   Given the expanding daily price range and the tight
supplies due to production declines, some analysts have
predicted that this might be the year in which sugar prices
explode again.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of wheat futures contracts
rose amid reports that the Soviet Union is interested in
buying as much as 600,000 tons of subsidized U.S. wheat. The
reports follow the purchase last week by the Soviets of
300,000 tons of subsidized U.S. wheat. Under a program
designed to boost U.S. exports, the Agriculture Department
compensates exporters that sell wheat to certain nations such
as the Soviet Union. Wheat prices also were supported by
continuing dry conditions in the wheat-growing regions of the
Northern Plains. The news helped traders shrug off reports
that the Soviet Union is having difficulty paying its bills
to U.S. exporters. But traders are concerned that the Soviet
Union might sacrifice any chance of winning Most Favored
Nation status from the U.S. if its economic face-off with
Lithuania turns violent. Prices of corn and soybean futures
contracts also rose yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply on light volume.
The July contract opened at $1.9430 a pound, off 2.6 cents
from Thursday's close, and settled at $1.9470, off 2.2 cents.
One analyst said he received a report from the trading pit
that the sharp price decline at the opening occurred when
only 12 May contracts were offered for sale "at the market."
A market order is one that permits the floor broker to fill
it at the best possible price available in the trading pit at
the time the order reaches the broker. William Adams, juice
analyst for PaineWebber in Orlando, Fla., said that in recent
days the market had been staging rallies based on previous
short sellers buying back contracts. When "that
{short-covering} dried up, so did any upward price momentum,"
he said. Short-covering buying occurs when investors who have
sold contracts in anticipation of lower prices buy them back
to take profits or when such prices don't materialize. He
also characterized trading yesterday as almost totally devoid
of participation by people in the juice business. Mr. Adams
noted that last week's stock movement report by the Florida
Citrus Processors Association was viewed by some traders as
bearish. "Anytime the movement number is below three million
gallons there are people who are disappointed," he added.
Movement was reported at 2.7 million gallons. He also said
that normally there is a certain amount of "bottom fishing"
by traders after a sharp sell-off on the opening but he
didn't see any yesterday.
