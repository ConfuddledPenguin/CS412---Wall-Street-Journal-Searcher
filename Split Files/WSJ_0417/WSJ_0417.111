   A Ciba-Geigy Ltd. subsidiary and Marsam Pharmaceuticals
Inc. agreed to jointly develop, make and distribute generic
drugs for hospitals and other health-care institutions.
   Ciba-Geigy, the Basel, Switzerland-based pharmaceuticals
and chemicals company, also will pay $10 million for about a
10% equity interest in Marsam, which has about 5.6 million
shares outstanding, including 600,000 subject to warrants.
The transaction is subject to the companies' executing a
definitive agreement.

   On the news, Marsam's shares rose $1.50, to close at
$20.50 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   Under terms of the 10-year accord, Marsam, Cherry Hill,
N.J., will produce generic injectable drugs; Ciba-Geigy's
Geneva Generics unit in Broomfield, Colo., will produce
individually packaged dosages of tablets and capsules. The
companies declined to provide sales estimates for the
venture.
   The agreement replaces one Marsam had with a unit of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Judith Arnoff, vice president at
Marsam, said that when Bristol-Myers Co. merged with Squibb
Corp., Bristol-Myers brought with it certain products that
put it in competition with Marsam.
