   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Vestron Inc., struggling in a crowded
home-video market, posted a large fourth-quarter loss,
compared with a year-earlier profit, with revenue plunging
29%.
   Vestron also said it is continuing negotiations for its
sale to Live Entertainment Inc. of Los Angeles. In February,
Live Entertainment said it was discussing a possible
acquisition of Vestron in exchange for new Live equity
securities.

   Vestron's fourth-quarter net loss totaled $47.2 million,
or $1.26 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of
$1.7 million, or five cents a share. Revenue fell to $66.7
million from $94.4 million.
   Vestron blamed the loss on problems related to the move by
Security Pacific Bank Corp. in 1988 to back out of a $100
million loan agreement. Vestron said the company was faced
with a "constricted cash situation" resulting from the
termination of the loan. Vestron, betting on the loan, poured
money into an unprofitable video-store chain. When the bank
withdrew, the company defaulted on debt agreements.
   Live, with estimated 1989 revenue of $450 million,
produces and distributes videocassettes and distributes music
and personal software.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Vestron stock closed at 75 cents a share, down 6.25 cents.
   For 1989, Vestron reported a loss of $135.1 million, or
$3.60 a share, compared with net income of $20.6 million, or
55 cents a share, in 1988. Revenue fell 26% to $236.2 million
from $321 million.
