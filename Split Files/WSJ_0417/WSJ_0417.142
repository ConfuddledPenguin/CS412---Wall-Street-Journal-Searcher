   Enthusiasm for IBM's better-than-expected earnings spread
to the over-the-counter market in bullish early morning
trading, but program trading siphoned the gains away in the
last hour.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index finished 0.39 higher at 436.70,
down from a gain of 2.08 in the first hour of trading.
Although 116 stocks hit new highs during the day and only 89
reached new lows, declining stocks led advancing issues by
1,001 to 881. Volume of 124.7 million shares was down from
141.4 million Thursday.

   The OTC market took its cue from the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which surged on the earnings announcement from
International Business Machines. "We definitely saw some
follow-through from the Big Board," said Hedi Renolds, head
of OTC position trading for Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis,
Tenn. Investors were buying a wide range of stocks and not
just one or two sectors, she added.
   But the day's gains fell prey to program trading and
nervousness about bellwether economic figures due for release
tommorrow, mainly as the Consumer Price Index, industrial
production and housing starts, according to Vanessa
Jagenburg, a vice president for OTC institutional sales at
Shearson Lehman Hutton
   Ms. Jagenburg said the technology sector, last week's star
performer along with some rebounding regional bank stocks,
slipped at the end of the day. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which
tracks the market's largest stocks, of which many are
technology stocks, closed up 1.76 at 433.85 for a 1% gain.
   Larry Bowman, senior analyst for Fidelity Investments'
technology and computer mutual funds, says the outlook for
the technology sector is mixed. He noted that while Intel
reported strong earnings last week, its revenue was lower
than some analysts had expected. Mr. Bowman cautioned that
investors should be selective and pay attention to individual
reports on sales and earnings.
   He noted that earnings are due out after the close today
for Microsoft, which rose 3/8 yesterday to 60 3/4, and later
in the week for Apple Computer, which gained 1/2 yesterday to
43 3/4. Also still to come is the quarterly report from Sun
Microsystems, which was off 1/8 yesterday at 23 3/4.
   Intel was unchanged at 42 1/2 on heavy volume, and Oracle
gained 3/8 to 16 1/4.
   The day's most active and high-flying tech stock was Octel
Communications, which soared 4 to close at 23 5/8 after some
analysts strongly recommended purchase of the stock following
favorable third-quarter earnings reported late last Thursday.
Nearly 1.7 million shares changed hands, or more than five
times average volume for the Milpitas, Calif., maker of voice
processing systems.
   Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that
Octel's results bucked the notion that the company's earnings
and revenue would be down from the previous quarter. They
added that the shift in the company's business mix and the
big jump in unit shipments during the most recent quarter are
reasons for renewed optimism.
   However, Martin Roth, president of New York-based Ferret
Capital Management, said that he's still skeptical. Mr. Roth
said he first sold Octel stock short in November, betting
that the stock will eventually decline because of what he
calls "signs of deterioration" in the rapid growth of its
gross margins. Short sellers borrow stock to sell, betting on
a decline so they can eventually replace shares at a profit.
   Mr. Roth said he's concerned by a drop in Octel's spending
for research and development, an increase in its sales,
general and administrative expenses and a change in the
company's accounting method. Although a number of traders
attributed yesterday's leap in Octel's shares to short
sellers covering their positions, Mr. Roth said he wasn't a
buyer of the stock yesterday.
   Stocks continued to rise and fall on earnings news. Office
Club jumped 2 1/4 to 16 1/2 after reporting first-quarter net
income of 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of three
cents a share a year earlier. Climbing in sympathy was Office
Depot, also a marketer of office supplies, up 1 at 19 3/4.
   Silk Greenhouse fell 1/2 to 3 1/2 after disclosing that it
expects to report a net loss for fiscal 1990, ended in
January, of $3.7 million to $4.3 million, including an
aftertax reserve of about $1.4 million against inventory. The
maker of artificial flowers said that lower-than-expected
sales and increased advertising, labor and financing costs
pressured fourth-quarter gross profit margins.
   T. Rowe Price Associates lost 2 3/4 to 23 1/4. The
investment-management company said it holds $64.6 million of
commercial paper and medium-term notes issued by Mortgage &amp;
Realty Trust, which last week filed a petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
T. Rowe Price said it expects to reduce the carrying value of
those securities, which will lower its earnings.
