   WHEELING, W.Va. -- Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.'s
shareholder group, headed by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., has agreed
to back a rival reorganization plan, marking a breakthrough
in the steelmaker's five-year bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Separately, Wheeling-Pittsburgh said first-quarter profit
fell 22% to $35.6 million, or $6.48 a share, from $45.8
million, or $8.49 a share, the year earlier.
Wheeling-Pittsburgh filed for protection against creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in April
1985.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Goldman Sachs, which owns 34% of Wheeling-Pittsburgh's common
stock, said it agreed to drop its own proposal and accept a
plan filed by the company and its unsecured creditors'
committee. Now, the plan must be approved by official
committees of unsecured creditors and stockholders.
   One current stumbling block to the plan's success,
however, is the lack of an accord with the United
Steelworkers of America. The reorganization plan requires
negotiation of a new labor pact that is acceptable to the
board and the official committee of unsecured creditors.
   Yesterday, steelworkers frustrated with lack of progress
in Wheeling-Pittsburgh negotiations, picketed company
headquarters in Wheeling. The union is seeking a contract
similar to one approved by LTV Steel Co., whose parent LTV
Corp. also is operating under Chapter 11 protection. However,
Wheeling-Pittsburgh and creditors deem the LTV labor accord
to be too rich.
   The plan, which Goldman Sachs has agreed to recommend to
other stockholders, calls for 1.5 million common shares of
the reorganized company to be distributed between the two 6%
and $5 preferred classes. It also calls for 1,740,000 shares
of common stock of the reorganized company to be distributed
to common shareholders, along with two million warrants for
common stock, exercisable within five years of the plan's
effective date. The reorganized company would have 20 million
shares of common stock.
   Goldman Sachs may also be required not to fund or propose
another competing plan unless the current plan isn't
consummated by Dec. 31.
   Goldman Sachs, as chairman of the company's equity
committee, submitted a rival plan on March 30. That plan
called for Goldman Sachs to raise $300 million of new debt
and equity capital for the new company, which would remain
independent with no majority shareholders. At the time,
Goldman said it was in the process of securing commitments
for $100 million of Wheeling-Pittsburgh new common stock and
$200 million of new senior debt.
   The two rival plans were submitted following a February
bankruptcy court order, directing each group to file a
separate reorganization plan.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh attributed the fall in first-quarter
net income to a 12.5% drop in shipments and a less-profitable
product mix. The latest quarter includes gains from tax-loss
carry-forwards of $6.9 million, or $1.35 a share. The
year-ago period included tax-loss carry-forwards of $14.3
million, or $2.80 a share.
   Sales dropped almost 11% to $256.8 million from $287.5
million.
   The company said incoming orders and backlog, while lower
than the year-ago period, increased during the first quarter
from Dec. 31. Wheeling-Pittsburgh said it expects similar
production levels and some improvements in shipping levels in
the second quarter. However, pricing, which softened from
1989's fourth quarter, is expected to continue softening in
the current quarter.
