   NEW YORK -- Metromedia Co., the closely held partnership
controlled by billionaire John W. Kluge, said it formed the
Kluge &amp; Co. division to succeed Kluge Subotnick Perkowski, a
now-dissolved leveraged buy-out firm.
   The new operation is a merger-and-acquisitions advisory
group, Metromedia said. It will focus on Metromedia's
investment portfolio and seek out acquisitions beyond
Metromedia's core businesses, the company said.
