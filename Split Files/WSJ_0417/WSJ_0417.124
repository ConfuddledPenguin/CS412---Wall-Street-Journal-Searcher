   Eeco Inc., Santa Ana, Calif., said it expects to report a
$1.4 million net loss for the year ended Jan. 1, but that
publication of its financial results would be delayed by the
proposed sale of its Maxi-Switch computer keyboard unit.
   The company said the estimated loss, on $63 million of
sales, includes a $6.7 million loss from continuing
operations and a $2.2 million loss from the planned
disposition of Maxi-Switch.

   Eeco also said its $10 million credit agreement with Sanwa
Bank of California expired March 31, but that Sanwa hadn't
