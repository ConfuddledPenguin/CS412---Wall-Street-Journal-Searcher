   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s entry
into the credit-card business has cost it a hefty chunk of
Citicorp's telecommunications business.
   Citicorp transferred $30 million in telecommunications
services now provided to its Citibank Card Products Group by
AT&amp;T to MCI Communications Corp., the nation's No. 2
long-distance communications carrier. The pact, which calls
for MCI to provide inbound and outbound voice services,
directory assistance, private data line services and MCI
calling cards for Citibank employees, expands an $80 million
MCI contract announced in November.

   Citibank's decision is a clear sign that the nation's
biggest bank issuer of credit cards feels threatened by
AT&amp;T's entry into one of its most profitable businesses.
   Landing more Citicorp business is a coup for MCI, which
has won some lucrative deals with financial services
companies in the last year, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
where it provides all of Merrill's voice and data
communications services. That account is worth roughly $40
million annually. Other recent MCI additions include Aetna
and Bear Stearns.
   James Bailey, Citibank group executive for U.S. credit
cards, said: "We've been studying communications carriers for
some time. We've been trying to balance our business between
AT&amp;T and MCI. The fact that AT&amp;T has decided to become a
competitor of ours maybe accelerated that decision a little
bit."
   Victor Pelson, AT&amp;T's president of communications
services, said that although some of AT&amp;T's big financial
services customers are "concerned about the competitive
threat" posed by AT&amp;T's new bank card, "the general reaction
among our big customers has been one of understanding. We
recognize that in some areas we will be customers, suppliers
and sometimes maybe even competitors."
   Said Nathan Kantor, president of MCI's Northeast Division:
"MCI, which doesn't own its own bank card, is starting to be
seen as much more of a strategic partner for these banks."
   Mr. Bailey said Citicorp has no intention of eliminating
all its business with AT&amp;T. "AT&amp;T will continue to be a
supplier to us in the card business." He added that AT&amp;T and
MCI will have "roughly equal" amounts of the credit card
group's communications business.
   Nevertheless, other Citicorp executives said that in
moving some of its business the bank wanted to make a point
of its displeasure with the "ungentlemanly" way AT&amp;T has
recruited some high level executives away from its main
credit-card unit, Citibank (South Dakota).
   "We wanted a particular group of managers who are expert
in this {credit card} business, and they didn't exist at
AT&amp;T," said Mr. Pelson. "But our hiring practices have been
aboveboard. We didn't do anything that wasn't of the highest
ethical standards."
   Citicorp's decision to switch vendors parallels its
dealings with other competitor credit card companies. For
instance, Citicorp units don't sell the travelers checks of
American Express Co., nor do Citicorp executives use that
company's green card for business expenses.
   AT&amp;T introduced its AT&amp;T Universal bank card last month.
Units of Synovus Financial Corp., a Columbus, Ga., bank
holding company, will issue the card and handle processing
and billing.
