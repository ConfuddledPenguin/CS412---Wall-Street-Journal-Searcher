   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The editor of National Geographic
magazine was replaced suddenly yesterday, and neither he nor
the society that publishes the magazine was saying whether he
was fired.
   "I just don't know the circumstances well enough to deal
with it," said Wilbur E. Garrett, 59 years old, who had been
editor since 1980.

   He added that there had been some "personality conflicts"
and some differences of opinion at the magazine, but he
wouldn't elaborate on the circumstances of his abrupt
departure.
   Mr. Garrett was succeeded by William T.E. Graves, 63, who
has been a senior member of the magazine's editorial staff
for 12 years.
   Mr. Graves becomes the eighth editor in the 102-year
history of the publication that has explored the world and
the creatures that inhabit it. The magazine is sent to the 10
million members of the National Geographic Society.
   Robert Sims, a spokesman for the society, said Mr.
Garrett's departure and Mr. Graves's promotion take effect
immediately.
