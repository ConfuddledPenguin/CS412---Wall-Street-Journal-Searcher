   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether
workers may sue their employers under state law for allegedly
firing them to avoid having to pay their pension benefits.
   The high court agreed to hear an appeal by New
Jersey-based Ingersoll-Rand Co. The company was sued by Perry
McClendon, a former salesman of its construction equipment,
who was hired in 1972 and fired in 1982, four months before
he would have been vested in the company's pension program.

   The case presents the important question of whether
employees may sue for damages under state law for so-called
wrongful discharge related to pension benefits, or whether
such lawsuits may only be filed under federal law, with
reparation limited to reinstating the pension benefits that
were lost.
   That question is part of a larger legal debate over
whether states may limit the right of employers to fire
workers who were hired for indefinite periods and aren't part
of union contracts. Many states have adopted an
"employment-at-will" approach, meaning an individual works at
the will of the employer and may be fired at any time,
without being given a reason.
   But, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce National
Litigation Center, 39 states have allowed individuals to sue
for damages on the ground that their dismissal violated
public policy. "Thousands of such claims have been filed
across the country," the Chamber said in a
friend-of-the-court brief. Dismissal to avoid paying pension
benefits is one example of a firing that would violate public
policy.
   The Chamber and other business groups argue that when
wrongful discharge lawsuits involve pension benefits, state
laws must give way to a federal law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act. The federal law prohibits firing workers
to interfere with their pension benefits and limits such
lawsuits to federal court.
   Mr. McClendon sued Ingersoll-Rand in state court in Texas,
arguing that he was improperly fired to keep him from
receiving pension benefits. Ingersoll-Rand, after the lawsuit
was filed, allowed Mr. McClendon to become vested in the
pension program, but he continued the lawsuit, hoping to
collect damages for the company's "bad faith conduct." A
Texas trial court dismissed the lawsuit prior to a trial.
   But the Texas Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that firing
workers "primarily" to avoid paying pension benefits violates
public policy and justifies allowing lawsuits for damages
under state law. The Texas high court said that such a
lawsuit isn't barred by federal pension law. The Texas court
ordered a trial in the case.
   Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the
company's appeal, to be argued in the fall. (Ingersoll-Rand
Co. vs. McClendon)
                                                                                                       

   Court in Brief
                                                                                                       

   In other action yesterday, the high court:
   -- Let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court in St.
Louis that a ban on public school dances in Purdy, Mo.,
doesn't violate the First Amendment's guarantee of separation
of church and state, although the rule was advanced
principally by local churches. (Clayton vs. Place)
   -- Stayed a California state court order that would
require the sale of four Hare Krishna temples in the U.S. to
satisfy a verdict against the religious group of more than $5
million including punitive damages and interest. The verdict
was for a mother who alleged that her 14-year-old daughter
was held against her will by members of the group in 1974 and
1975. The stay is in effect until the high court decides
whether to hear the Hare Krishnas' appeal, which challenges
the constitutionality of the damage award. (International
Society for Krishna Consciousness vs. George)
