   LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. said its
Occidental Eastern subsidiary began an extended production
test of the Lufeng field in the South China Sea.
   The Lufeng 22-1-3 well, drilled late last year, began
producing at about 10,000 barrels a day of 31 degree API
gravity oil.

   In a shortcut of the usual process, Occidental will use
the exploratory well as a production well. Oil flows from the
well to a semi-submersible floating platform and then into a
converted 45,000-deadweight-ton tanker that acts as a
floating production, storage and off-loading vessel.
Occidental said that "safety and environmental concerns have
been addressed in the design criteria."
   The Lufeng discovery well, Lufeng 22-12, was drilled early
last year and was tested for 12 days last June at 10,600
barrels of oil a day.
   Occidental said the test is being conducted to confirm
design parameters and reservoir performance prior to
full-scale development in 1991 of the field, which is located
about 120 miles off the coast of China.
   Occidental Eastern is operator of the project, with a 65%
stake. Ampol Exploration and AGL Petroleum of Australia each
have a 10% interest. Repsol Exploracion S.A. of Spain has a
15% interest.
