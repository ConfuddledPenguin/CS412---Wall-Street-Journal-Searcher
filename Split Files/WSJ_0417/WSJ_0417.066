   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Dataproducts Corp. said it
signed a definitive agreement to be acquired for $160 million
by a joint venture formed by two affiliates of Hitachi Ltd.,
the Tokyo electronic equipment maker.
   The affiliates, Hitachi Koki Co. and Nissei Sangyo Co.,
said they will launch a $10-a-share tender offer within five
days for all of Dataproducts' stock outstanding. The offer
will be followed by a merger in which any remaining shares
will be acquired at the same price.

   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Dataproducts jumped $3.25 to $9.625 on volume of more than
1.5 million shares.
   The agreement appears to end two years of turmoil during
which time Dataproducts fended off a hostile suitor, sought
"strategic" bidders to buy the company, sold its headquarters
building and Southern California manufacturing operations,
and used those proceeds to repurchase 20% of its stock.
   The proposed merger gives Dataproducts the "strategic
partner" it has been searching for. Jack C. Davis, chairman
and chief executive officer, said he expects to remain in
those posts and that no immediate changes in company programs
are expected. Mr. Davis said he anticipates that he will be
joined on the board by representatives of Hitachi Koki and
Nissei Sangyo.
   "There's good chemistry here; we have similar kinds of
motivations for long-term investments and a belief in
focusing on quality products," Mr. Davis said. "As time goes
along, we'll be looking for ways to gain" from the new
ownership.
   Mr. Davis said that Dataproducts, a computer printer maker
with 1989 sales of $353 million, is strong in the U.S. and
Canada. Nissei Sangyo, Hitachi's 56.9%-owned trading arm, had
world-wide sales of 482 billion ($3.05 billion) yen last
year. "They have strengths in many, many countries we don't
have a presence in," Mr. Davis said.
   Hitachi Koki, 22.5% owned by Hitachi, had sales of 109
billion yen last year and makes power tools, printers and
scientific instruments. In the printer business, "we compete
with Hitachi Koki at the top of our line and bottom of their
line," Mr. Davis said.
   DPC Acquisition Corp., which was forced to terminate a
$10-a-share tender offer for Dataproducts in January because
it couldn't obtain financing, expressed disappointment in the
merger agreement. The New York investment group, which holds
about one million Dataproducts shares, is controlled by
Crescott Investment Associates, Wilson Investment Group,
Kernel Corp. and Catalyst Partners.
   "Management should have been able to obtain a better
price. A strategic buyer can pay more for a company's assets
than a financial buyer," said Micki Hidayatallah, Crescott's
chief executive officer. He said it wasn't clear whether DPC
would or could take any action, in light of a standstill
agreement with Dataproducts.
   Dataproducts's board believes that the merger agreement
"is in the best interests of shareholders, as well as our
employees, customers and suppliers," Mr. Davis said. The bid
is fully financed, whereas "DPC was never able to raise any
financing or a `highly confident' letter," he added.
