   Union Electric Co., St. Louis, said it agreed to acquire
retail electric properties in Missouri from the Arkansas
Power &amp; Light Co. unit of Entergy Corp., New Orleans, for
about $70 million.
   The utility said that under the agreement, 28,000 Missouri
retail electric customers served by Arkansas Power would
become Union Electric customers. The company said it will
purchase electrical power from Arkansas Power for 10 years
initially, and has an option to extend the power purchases
for at least an additional five years.

end of 1990.
