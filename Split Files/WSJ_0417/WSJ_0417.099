   A Dallas bankruptcy judge ruled that borrowers who
fraudulently obtained loans from now-defunct savings
associations can't escape liability for those loans in
bankruptcy court.
   In addition, the ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven A.
Felsenthal makes clear that such borrowers are liable even if
the loan officers were aware of the fraud. The ruling could
have significant ramifications in Texas because so many
fraudulent loans were obtained from Texas thrifts.

   In this instance, Vernon B. Smith and James W. Smith II,
cousins who had filed for personal bankruptcy, contested
their liability for three loans from the defunct Vernon
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas for real estate
developments in the Dallas area.
   One of the loans enabled the Smiths to acquire a piece of
property from a Vernon subsidiary in exchange for the promise
of future loans that would enable their 50-year-old family
business to continue operating.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., represented by
lawyers from the Dallas office of Arter &amp; Hadden, showed
during trial that proceeds from two of the loans weren't used
for development but for operating expenses for the Smiths'
businesses, including James W. Smith's $200,000 annual
salary.
   The FDIC lawyers successfully argued that although
Vernon's lending officers were aware of the improper uses of
the loan proceeds, federal thrift examiners had to rely in
their examination on the actual loan files that falsely
showed that the proceeds were being used for development.
   "The great risk of failure in these loans, and ultimately
of the savings and loan which made them, was borne by the
insurers of Vernon Savings, the FDIC and ultimately the
taxpayers," Judge Felsenthal wrote.
   "Sophisticated real estate developers who participate in
loans that are not prudent with financially troubled,
federally insured lending institutions and conspire to hide
the true nature and purpose of the imprudent loans from
federal examiners cannot have the resulting debts . . .
discharged in bankruptcy," the judge wrote.
   Judge Felsenthal ruled that the Smiths together are liable
for the $1,085,000 loan with which they acquired the property
from the Vernon subsidiary. He also ruled that James W. Smith
is liable for another $1.6 million loan. The judge did order
the third loan, financed at the actual value of the property,
discharged in the Smiths' bankruptcy cases. The lawyer for
the Smiths couldn't be reached for comment.
   Despite the relatively small sizes of the loans in this
case, Judge Felsenthal's ruling is significant because "large
numbers of other borrowers at failed thrifts acted in similar
fashion," said Charles McDonald, a senior trial lawyer with
the FDIC in Washington, D.C.
   "I'm delighted that the court determined that these people
are not entitled to the fresh start accorded to honest
debtors," Mr. McDonald said.

   MCDONALD'S CORP. must defend originality of jingle in
court, judge rules.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of New York
denied the hamburger maker's motion to throw out a federal
copyright claim alleging that McDonald's lifted the tune and
concept of the rock song "Life Is a Rock (But the Radio
Rolled Me)."
   The authors of "Life is a Rock" sued McDonald's and its ad
agency, Leo Burnett Co., last April after the allegedly
similar jingle was used in a February 1989 McDonald's
commercial. The authors are seeking an undetermined amount of
damages, which their attorney, Robert C. Osterberg, said
could total "many millions of dollars."
   "Life is a Rock" was recorded by a short-lived group
called Reunion in 1974 and became a top ten hit after its
release, selling more than 750,000 copies. The song uses a
"patter" technique, in which the words are sung rapidly.
   One of the song's authors, Joey Levine, was well known to
McDonald's and its ad agency. In 1987, Mr. Levine composed
the "Good Time/Great Taste" McDonald's theme song.
   "The evidence submitted thus far leads to the conclusion
that" the McDonald's song in question "resembles `Life' more
than any other patter song, and it remains for the jury to
decide whether that similarity is substantial," Judge
Patterson wrote in his opinion.
   The case isn't expected to be heard by a jury before next
year.

   PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERS try to tackle NFL and teams owners in
lawsuit.
   Eight players, including Green Bay Packers quarterback Don
Majkowski and New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil, are
objecting to National Football League rules restricting
player movement among teams.
   Their antitrust suit, filed in federal court in Newark,
N.J. last week, could have implications for other
professional team sports that impose such restrictions,
lawyers said.
   The suit is the first to be filed since the players' union
ended its status as a collective bargaining agent last
November, said Jeffrey Kessler of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, a
lawyer for the players. The union's action came in response
to a decision by the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
St. Louis that required such a move in order to allow
individual players to file antitrust suits.
   The current suit concerns "Plan B," a set of rules
governing free agency instituted by the NFL last year after
collective bargaining negotiations broke down. The players
have been working without a contract since 1987.
   Under the plan, 37 players on each team are considered
restricted free agents. That gives the teams the right of
first refusal if the players want to move and specified
compensation for players they lose. Remaining players are
free to negotiate with any club for a two-month period.
   According to the suit, the players had planned to offer
their services to competing teams for the coming 1990 season
but had not received any offers because of the NFL restraints
on free agency.
   In a press release, the NFL Management Council said:
"Further litigation is no answer to the problems arising from
this labor dispute. Bargaining offers the best solution for
NFL clubs and NFL players."
