   Universal Foods Corp., citing the benefits of a continuing
push into what it calls "high growth, high return
businesses," said net income for its second quarter ended
March 31 climbed 19%.
   The Milwaukee-based food products concern reported
earnings of $10 million, or 40 cents a share, up from the
year-earlier $8.4 million, or an adjusted 34 cents a share.
Per-share earnings figures reflect an increase in shares
outstanding to 25.3 million from the year-earlier 24.9
million, which was adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split paid
last October.
