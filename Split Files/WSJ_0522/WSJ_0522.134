   Ross Stores Inc., citing inventory and marketing problems,
said first-quarter profit declined 53%.
   For the 13 weeks ended May 5, the Newark, Calif.,
off-price apparel retailer reported net income of $1.6
million, or seven cents a share, compared with $3.4 million,
or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 9% to $171
million from $155 million, the company said.

   Ross, which said it was "disappointed" by the results,
cited imbalances in the apparel mix in its stores prompted by
a late fourth-quarter attempt to control inventory by cutting
back receipts of early spring and basic merchandise. It added
that its marketing efforts didn't meet expectations, either.
   "The merchandise mix in our stores has returned to normal
seasonal proportions, and we are currently implementing
programs to strengthen our marketing," the company said.
   Ross had 161 stores at May 5, compared with 143 a year
earlier.
