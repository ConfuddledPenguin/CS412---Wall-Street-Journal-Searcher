   Talman Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Chicago,
said it reached a preliminary agreement to be acquired by a
private investor group for $10 a share, or $100 million, in
cash and notes.
   Under the agreement, Talman shareholders would receive $5
a share in cash, and senior subordinated notes of a newly
formed holding company, Talman Bancorp, that Talman valued at
$5 a share.

   The investor group is led by Harrison I. Steans, who has
headed a number of Chicago-area bank-holding companies during
the past several years.
   The proposed sale was required by thrift-bailout
legislation passed by Congress last year that prohibited
thrifts from including non-earning assets such as "good will"
on balance sheets, said James Sherman, Talman's senior vice
president. In Talman's case, goodwill amounted to $562
million; subtracting it left Talman undercapitalized in the
view of federal regulators.
   The new owners are expected to retain Talman's current
management and to invest $300 million in Talman common stock
following the purchase.
