   Time was when jackets and ties were a must
   To be properly attired;
   Now even the better places have signs:
   "Shoes and Shirts Required."
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   The Bard tied himself to a tether,
   Because the world, in scene after scene,
   Cannot get its act together.
   -- Joshua Adams.
