   TIMONIUM, Md. -- Kirschner Medical Corp. said an American
Arbitration Association panel awarded it $1.2 million in its
dispute with a former supplier.
   The proceeding began with a complaint by the supplier, ALM
Equipment Hospitaliers S.A. of France. The arbitration panel
last summer decided that ALM had unfairly breached an
agreement to supply Kirschner with surgical lights.
