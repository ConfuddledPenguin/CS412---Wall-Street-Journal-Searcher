   Highlighting the slow progress of a proposed $4.38 billion
buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp., a group of
unions is negotiating to hire Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to help
obtain financing.
   The union group, which has a deadline of Aug. 9 to get the
financing, still hasn't found a new chief executive officer
to take UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf's place six weeks after
signing a merger agreement with the UAL board.

   Uncertainty over management has in turn held back efforts
to woo potential bank lenders. "Nothing can happen without a
management team," said one U.S. bank executive. Until now,
the financing effort has been led by Salomon Inc., one of the
pilots union's advisers.
   People familiar with the buy-out attempt say hiring
Goldman to work alongside Salomon is aimed at bolstering the
group's credibility among bankers who will have to decide
whether to lend roughly $4 billion in the face of regulatory
pressure on banks to avoid making loans to companies with
heavy debt.
   Wall Street analysts say the effort to obtain financing is
also complicated by the lack of a cash-equity contribution
from outside investors, the up-and-down nature of airline
profitability, and control by union leaders instead of
business executives.
   The group's contract to buy the airline will lapse if
financing isn't obtained within four months of an April 9
merger agreement with the UAL board. An earlier buy-out
effort collapsed in October because of an inability to obtain
financing.
   Hiring Goldman could also address another question that
has dogged the union group in its preliminary efforts --
namely, who is in charge? Neither the United pilots union nor
the machinists union has absolute control of the venture,
which also includes flight attendants and non-contract
employees. Some people who have dealt with the unions say
that has slowed the group's decision making.
   In addition to Salomon, the pilots union has been advised
by the mergers advisory boutique of Keilin &amp; Bloom, two
former employees of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. The machinists union
adviser is Brian Freeman.
   Some people familiar with the enterprise say they believe
Salomon, along with Keilin &amp; Bloom, suffered a loss of
credibility when the earlier buy-out collapsed. That buy-out
included the pilots, but not the machinists. Salomon "carries
baggage" from the earlier failure, said one person familiar
with the union effort.
   UAL's stock price has languished ever since the unions --
with the threat of a proxy fight by Coniston Partners, which
owns an 11.8% stake -- persuaded UAL's board to accept their
$201-a-share offer. UAL stock has fallen from $166.50 a share
on April 4 to as low as $150.375. It fell $1 a share to
$153.75 yesterday in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   One recruitment difficulty the labor group has faced is
that the executive would likely have to give up a job without
being certain the unions can complete the purchase. Another
is that some executives might balk at a governance structure
giving power to union leaders, leaving the executive as a
hired hand.
   It isn't clear whether Goldman can do much to resolve
these difficulties. However, Goldman has had a higher profile
in the merger-advisory business in recent years than Salomon.
And it has ties to Japanese banks via an investment in
Goldman held by Sumitomo Bank &amp; Trust Co.
   An official of a major Japanese bank that considered
participating in the earlier buy-out effort said the bank is
"not at all excited" by the unions' current bid. He added
that bank executives who recommended participating in the
earlier labor-management bid lost face with their supervisors
when that bid collapsed and wreaked havoc on the financial
markets.
   Japanese banks, in general, "have doubts about the ability
of labor to run a company," the same official added. The
Japanese might look more favorably on the transaction, he
said, if it contained more equity and if the unions had a
management team in place.
   The union bid does include "sweat equity" in the form of
contract concessions said to be worth $2 billion over five
years. The unions have hired an executive search firm to help
find a successor to Mr. Wolf as chief executive.
   A number of names have surfaced as possible candidates,
including USAir Group Inc. Vice Chairman Randall Mailin and
Donald Carty, chief financial officer of AMR Corp, parent of
American Airlines. However, union representatives deny either
executive is in the running. Earlier talks with Richard
Ravitch, former chairman of the New York Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, broke down.
   A union spokesman issued a statement late yesterday
confirming that the labor group is talking with Goldman about
working with Salomon. "Those discussions are continuing. No
agreement has been reached," the statement said. A Goldman
spokesman declined comment.
