   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., New York, said it cut
some charges for its enhanced facsimile service originating
from the U.S., effective immediately.
   The telecommunications company said it reduced the prices
largely in response to customers' requests to receive an
incentive for using the facsimile message service. The cuts
applying to the multiple-copy service increase in proportion
to the number of recipients. AT&amp;T also is giving a discount
on overall monthly use of the enhanced fax service, and
cutting prices 20% for faxes sent to Britain and Japan.

   AT&amp;T said there are four elements to the price cuts. For
the multiple service, the per-page charge drops in the U.S.
by as much as 33%, depending on the number of recipients. The
discounts apply if there are five or more recipients.
   AT&amp;T also is increasing by 50% the amount of information
that can be sent on its standard fax page, and will give a
quantity discount, based on total dollars of fax service a
month, of as much as 10%, in addition to the per-page
discount.
