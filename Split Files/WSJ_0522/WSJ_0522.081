   WASHINGTON -- The abortion battle has spawned a legal
debate: Can the National Organization for Women sue Operation
Rescue under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law?
   The two opposing groups are locked in a legal battle that
has financially imperiled Operation Rescue, an organization
of anti-abortion activists who direct their efforts at
abortion clinics.

   "We're making every effort to hit them in the pocketbook,"
says Patricia Ireland, NOW's executive vice president. "We
know ourselves that it's hard to organize when you don't have
money."
   NOW's use of RICO against Operation Rescue in large
measure has crippled fund-raising efforts and has forced the
group to lay off 20 of its 23 paid staff members, to move out
of its offices in Binghamton, N.Y., into smaller quarters and
to curtail activities substantially. During a two-day period
last week Operation Rescue raised only $200 in contributions.
   "People have nowhere to send their money without fear the
government will seize the money, and so they don't send it,"
says Robert Jewitt, Operation Rescue's national media
coordinator. "A lot of the activities that we planned can't
go on."
   The legal activity is rekindling controversy about the
1970 RICO law, which was aimed at organized crime but which
has been extended into business cases. NOW argues that
Operation Rescue members are acting like racketeers, trying
to frighten pregnant women and health workers away from
abortion clinics.
   "There's a lot of questions whether this law was designed
for this sort of thing," says John Decker of the DePaul
University College of Law. "Congress had in mind putting
together an instrument to use against conventional organized
crime -- the mob. This is clearly a very creative and very
unconventional use of legislation that wasn't designed for
political use."
   In the legal battle, Operation Rescue has been fined
$150,000 in New York, and other anti-abortion groups have
been fined $350,000 in the state. In another setback for
Operation Rescue, the Supreme Court yesterday let stand a
federal judge's order, based on a NOW suit citing Civil
War-era laws, that forbids the group's members from blocking
women trying to enter New York-area abortion clinics.
   "They have made it very difficult for us," Randall Terry,
Operation Rescue's founder, says of the NOW suits. "But they
cannot understand that we have authority and power even if we
don't have money. We have moral absolutes we're willing to
fight by and die by if necessary, and we have courage."
   Last week, a day after the Supreme Court declined to lift
a state court injunction keeping protesters away from clinics
in Georgia, five Operation Rescue members bound themselves
together with bicycle locks inside the Atlanta Surgicenter.
   Some believe the struggle between NOW and Operation Rescue
represents a deep cultural dispute. "These are two groups
that live in fundamentally different worlds and hardly ever
encounter each other," says Faye Ginsburg, an anthropologist
at New York University who has studied both the women's
movement and the evangelical movement. "One group sees
abortion as a symbol of the decadence of the world. The other
sees abortion as fundamental to women being able to achieve
opportunity and to control their lives."
   Mr. Terry describes NOW as "a radical fringe group with a
very liberal socialist agenda." He adds: "We believe in God
and the precious sanctity of each human life and they believe
in a sordid, base lifestyle that includes the murder of their
offspring."
   Molly Yard, the leader of NOW, says that Mr. Terry's
forces are "instructing their children to bite our people on
the legs and forming flying wedges." She has urged members of
NOW to increase their vigilance at abortion clinics.
   "They have every right to picket and say what they
believe, but they have no right to close down a legitimate
business," Ms. Yard says. "We won't fight them physically,
but we will be at the clinics to keep them open."
   NOW says use of the RICO law is appropriate because
Operation Rescue is engaged in extortion, the use of force or
threats of force to deprive others of a valuable right.
Operation Rescue leaders deny the charges.
   "The traditional use of this {law} is in cases where
someone is deprived of a property right, like in blackmail,"
says Ms. Ireland, NOW's legal strategist. "But the thing of
value can be an intangible right, like the right to obtain
medical services at an abortion clinic, or the right of a
clinic to do business."
   Several judges have agreed with her, and NOW has won
contempt-of-court judgments stemming from its racketeering
and other suits. In Congress, the House Judiciary Committee
is working on an overhaul of RICO that would restrict the
reach of the statute, but discussions have reached an
impasse.
   Some legal experts say they are uneasy with how broadly
RICO has been applied, particularly in cases involving
abortion protesters. "Whatever you can say about these
demonstrators, they're not racketeers," says Alan Dershowitz
of the Harvard Law School. "They're not doing it for a
financial motive. The idea that you can terrorize protesters
with the threat of bankruptcy is an attack on democracy."
   G. Robert Blakey, the Notre Dame Law School professor who
drafted RICO, argues the law has broad legitimate
application. "The statute applies to anyone -- with a white
collar, a blue collar or no collar at all," he says. "It's
not for mobsters only."
   But Mr. Blakey believes RICO is being used not to
vindicate the rights of clinics as much as to chill the
rights of demonstrators. "Unfortunately, RICO is being used
as a political tool and people are being brought in not for
doing something unlawful on the picket line but because they
have a certain viewpoint," he says. "These two sides in this
death struggle have grabbed this statute and are pulling it
down with them."
   Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), a principal figure in the
congressional negotiations on RICO, says, "A search for the
original intent of this law is vain and probably not very
relevant."
   The abortion-rights movement hasn't prevailed in all its
battles against anti-abortion activists. The American Life
League defeated a RICO suit by Planned Parenthood, NOW and
others in Pennsylvania when it argued that neither the league
nor Judie Brown, the group's president, was at a 1988 protest
in Philadelphia.
   Joseph Scheidler, president of the Pro Life Action League,
an ally of Operation Rescue, has filed a $5 million
defamation-of-character suit against NOW, Ms. Yard and Ms.
Ireland. "This is a grudge battle," says Mr. Scheidler, who
says his battles with NOW and others have cost him $90,000 in
legal fees. "It's their ideology against ours. We're not
going to give up and they're not going to give up."
