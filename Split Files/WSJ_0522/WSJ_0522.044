   BOGOTA, Colombia -- Antonio Navarro is on the run again.
   For much of his adult life, Mr. Navarro, as one of the
leaders of the M-19 guerrilla group, ran for cover from
Colombia's authorities. Now, the 42-year-old Mr. Navarro is
running for president.

   M-19's decision earlier this year to lay down its arms and
fight with ballots rather than bullets is seen by many here
as a sign that peace can be achieved in violence-torn
Colombia. Never Colombia's most radical guerrilla group, M-19
is now seeking a place for itself in the country's political
landscape as a non-Communist left-wing player and hopes to
convince other guerrilla groups to follow its example.
   But sitting in his Bogota campaign headquarters, clad in a
bullet-proof vest and surrounded by machine gun-toting
security guards, Mr. Navarro says it was a lot easier being a
guerrilla than a candidate.
   "More candidates have been killed in the past few months
than guerrilla chiefs," he says. So what prompted M-19 to
switch from fighting Colombia's institutions to trying to run
them? "It's crazy," he acknowledges. "But we Colombians are
crazy people."
   Mr. Navarro's presence in the elections next Sunday speaks
volumes about Colombia's craziness. He was only picked as
M-19's candidate after the guerrilla group's charismatic
leader, Carlos Pizarro, was gunned down by an assassin on a
commercial flight while en route to a campaign appearance --
the third Colombian presidential candidate to be killed in
nine months.
   Mr. Navarro is no stranger to violence either. He lost his
left leg when a grenade was thrown at him in 1985 at a time
when he was seeking to negotiate a truce between M-19 and the
government. The grenade attack occured as Mr. Navarro was
resting after being mysteriously kidnapped and just as
mysteriously freed by a still-unidentified group. After
nearly dying, Mr. Navarro underwent long months of therapy in
Cuba and Mexico, where he remained in exile until last year.
   Attacks and kidnapping were M-19's stock in trade too --
though it mixed these with attention-getting stunts such as
the 1974 robbery of the sword and spurs of freedom fighter
Simon Bolivar or Robin Hood-style raids on supermarkets to
distribute food to the poor.
   The group is best known for its 1985 assault on Bogota's
Palace of Justice that ended in tragedy when at least 95
people, including the country's chief justice, died during
the 26-hour battle. M-19 also stormed the Dominican Republic
Embassy in 1980 and held 14 foreign ambassadors hostage for
two months until huge ransoms were paid. And in 1987, M-19
kidnapped conservative politician Alvaro Gomez, who today is
running for president against his former captors.
   To M-19 officials and sympathizers, this symbolizes the
new spirit of democracy and dialogue, rather than violence,
that is in the air. "If we only had successes, we'd be in
power," Mr. Navarro acknowledges.
   "There are no perspectives for bearded people descending
from the mountains and occupying Bolivar Square," the name of
the main square in most Colombian cities, he adds. "We have
to recognize that today that's not possible. We have to
represent the broadest interest of society. Today, what
society wants is peace."
   For M-19, the end of 16 years of guerrilla warfare came at
an emotional ceremony in March in the mountain rebel campsite
of Santo Domingo, 200 miles southwest of Bogota. "For
Colombia and for peace, lay down your arms," an M-19 officer
ordered, and one by one, the guerrillas placed their weapons,
draped in red, yellow and blue M-19 flags on a table, in
return for amnesty. The next day, more than 400 guerrillas
burned their camouflage uniforms, changed into civilian
clothes and rode down the mountains in buses.
   Today, M-19 is urging other guerrilla groups to follow
their example and offering to act as an intermediary in
negotiations. Three guerrilla and peasant self-defense groups
have indicated willingness to join the peace process, but
several other Marxist guerrilla groups are still fighting and
disrupting the electoral process. That includes the
4,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the
radical 1,500-strong National Liberation Army, which claims
responsibility for a recent wave of assassinations and
kidnappings.
   So strongly in favor of peace is M-19 that it even urges
the government to give up its 10-month old war on drugs and
make a deal with the drug lords, who initiated another wave
of deadly bombings after the government turned down their
offers to get out of the business in return for the
government rescinding an extradition treaty with the U.S.
   The way Mr. Navarro sees it, Colombia is being asked to
make all the efforts in the war on drugs and pay the violent
price of the extradition treaty while drug-consuming
countries do little to curb the problem. "The war is here,
people are dying, while Americans are happily consuming
cocaine," says Mr. Navarro. "We can't keep doing what the
State Department wants."
   Many Colombians, including conservatives, subscribe to
M-19's view, arguing that the cocaine cartels' bombs are just
as criminal as M-19's violence and kidnappings, for which the
group was pardoned. But government officials retort that
political crimes are different under Colombian law from the
common criminal actions of narcotic traffickers.
   Although M-19's position on drugs differs radically from
the government's, officials say the fact it is voicing it is
a victory for Colombian democracy and the peace process.
"M-19 gave up its violent ways, but its politics are the same
as before," says Rafel Pardo, who negotiated the peace accord
with M-19. "That's what the peace process is all about. We're
not asking them to give up their ideas."
   Mr. Navarro and many independent analysts see a strong
possibility for M-19 filling a political void on the left
that could break the traditional bipartisan nature of
Colombian politics, in which the Liberal and Conservative
parties take the lion's share of the vote. But so far, Mr.
Navarro, who looks uncomfortable in a suit and tie and
bullet-proof vest, hasn't been able to take much advantage of
democracy. With three candidates already killed, the campaign
has been largely limited to television addresses and small
meetings with selected individuals under heavy security.
   "We were in clandestinity for 16 years, and now we're
leading a clandestine campaign," jokes Rosenberg Pabon,
M-19's campaign manager. Adds Mr. Navarro, pointing to his
retinue of security guards, "I'm a prisoner candidate. The
only difference with the past is that before they hunted me
and now they protect me."
