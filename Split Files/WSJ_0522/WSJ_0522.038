   Common Drug May Help
   To Keep Arteries Clear

   THE BUILDUP in arteries of fatty deposits that can cause
heart attacks may be blocked by a commonly prescribed drug.
   New studies are producing tantalizing hints that the drug
nifedipine prevents atherosclerosis, the clogging of arteries
that nourish the heart with oxygen-rich blood. The drug is
used to treat high blood pressure and angina, chest pains
associated with coronary heart disease. Nifedipine is one of
a class of drugs, called calcium channel blockers, that keep
arteries and veins open by impeding the flow of calcium into
muscle cells that surround blood vessels.
   Some scientists believe calcium also is involved in the
formation of fatty deposits. Scientists at Vanderbilt
University tested this idea in rabbits genetically
predisposed to atherosclerosis by feeding them a
cholesterol-rich diet. After four months, rabbits given the
drug had clear arteries, while the arteries of those denied
the drug became plugged.
   Because of this and other animal studies, researchers at
Johns Hopkins Hospital recently compared nifedipine's effect
with a placebo in preventing plaque formation in 144 patients
who had undergone bypass surgery to replace obstructed
arteries. After a year, the new arteries were clear of
deposits in 52% of patients given a placebo, while 67% of
those taking nifedipine were deposit-free.
   Doctors at Hannover Medical School in Hannover, West
Germany, just produced similar findings in a three-year study
of 435 patients with mild angina. Their finding, published in
the British medical journal the Lancet, found that the
drug-treated group had 28% fewer new artery obstructions than
those in the group taking a placebo.
   Nifedipine is sold under the brand name Procardia by
Pfizer Inc. A spokesman for the company said it is planning
further tests.
                                                                                                       

   Lyme Disease Protein
   Signals Early Detection
                                                                                                       

   THE DISCOVERY of a gene is holding promise of a better
method for detecting Lyme disease.
   Lyme disease is a potentially serious arthritis-like
ailment caused by a bacteria borne by certain tiny ticks.
Incidence of the disease, identified in 1975, is on the rise,
and outbreaks are especially common starting about this time
of year. Roughly half of the people bitten by the
bacteria-bearing tick develop the problem, but detecting it
is difficult because of its vague early symptoms, such as
fatigue and headaches, and because diagnostic tests are
imprecise.
   An accurate test is crucial because the bacteria can be
eradicated, but only if treated early with antibiotics.
Current tests detect the presence of antibodies produced by
the body to fight off the bacteria, but many people produce
too little antibody to be measured by the tests.
   Rance LeFebvre and Guey-Chuen Perng at the University of
California at Davis and Russell C. Johnson at the University
of Minnesota say they found a gene that produces a protein
common to many forms of the bacteria. The researchers say
they can detect minuscule amounts of antibody stimulated by
the protein.
   A U.S. subsidiary of Akzo N.V. of the Netherlands has
acquired the rights to develop a commercial diagnostic test
and also a vaccine that might protect people against the
bacterial infection.
                                                                                                       

   Zeroing In on Genes
   Linked to Alzheimer's
                                                                                                       

   SCIENTISTS SAY they have located a gene involved in
causing a type of Alzheimer's disease that strikes late, at
about 69 years of age.
   The new finding by researchers at Duke University greatly
buttresses claims that the degenerative brain disorder can be
inherited. The discovery, which hasn't been published,
suggests that two different genes are associated with
Alzheimer's disease. In 1987, researchers at Massachusetts
General Hospital reported uncovering the first gene, but
their finding became controversial when studies by the Duke
group and others couldn't replicate it in other families.
   Scientists now believe they have solved the problem: Many
people in the Duke study had inherited a different gene for
Alzheimer's. The gene located in the Massachusetts study
seems to predispose people to a form of the disease that hits
people early, in their 40s or 50s. That gene was traced to
chromosome 21, one of the 23 chromosomes in the nucleus of
every cell that contains all the human genes.
   The Duke researchers, led by Allen Roses, say their gene
is on chromosome 19. Neither set of researchers has found the
gene itself, but instead they have identified a gene marker
that is located near it.
   Scientists are now racing to duplicate the two reports and
isolate the exact genes, but the search is hindered by the
difficulty in finding families with multiple cases of the
disease, says P. Michael Coneally, a geneticist at Indiana
University, Indianapolis, who is gathering information on
such families under a government grant.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE CENTERS for Disease Control says a state-by-state
telephone survey in 1988 found that the percentage of people
who claimed to know their cholesterol level ranged from 40%
in New Mexico to 58% in Maine. . . . Scientists at the
University of Oklahoma's department of otorhinolaryngology
say they have identified proteins produced by cells in the
inner ear in response to stress. The scientists say the
proteins protect the ear against noise and other potentially
damaging shocks and may provide clues to preventing some
types of hearing loss.
