   OBNINSK, U.S.S.R. -- A series of sonarlike pings
reverberate inside the white, concrete room. They signal an
experiment is under way at one of the world's biggest nuclear
test reactors.
   The scientists tending Fast Critical Assembly No. 2, at
this laboratory a few hours from Moscow, are experimenting to
find a safer, more-efficient way to arrange uranium fuel
inside a commercial nuclear-power reactor. Soon they'll start
tests on a really wild notion hatched in Moscow: a reactor
bathed in molten lead.

   Will it work? "God knows]" laughs one laboratory engineer.
   The folks who brought you Chernobyl have a new mission: To
invent an ultrasafe nuclear power reactor. In laboratories
like this around the Soviet Union, scientists are
experimenting with a slew of possible new approaches to
nuclear safety. In the aftermath of the disastrous 1986
Chernobyl accident, many Soviet officials feel the only way
to repair the nuclear industry's tattered image is to leap
beyond existing technology and invent reactors that are safer
than Western models.
   "We need new thinking, new reactors and new philosophies,"
says Prof. Igor Slesarev, an official of Moscow's I.V.
Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy.
   Early results from this scientific brainstorming intrigue
Western physicists. "There are some interesting ideas coming
out of the Soviets," says Octave Du Temple, executive
director of the American Nuclear Society, an association of
U.S. nuclear engineers and officials. Washington hasn't yet
responded to Soviet proposals to collaborate on such
research, but the two countries' scientists are exchanging
information informally. "We've had more (nuclear) discussions
with the Soviets in the past two years than in the previous
30," says Mr. Du Temple.
   There's more than scientific curiosity at stake. A
world-wide search is under way for reactor designs that avoid
safety flaws such as those behind the world's three worst
nuclear accidents: at Britain's Windscale reactor in 1957; at
Three Mile Island in the U.S. in 1979; and at Chernobyl in
1986. Based on that not-so-fail-safe history, nuclear foes
contend that a truly safe reactor is impossible. But
atomic-industry supporters say improved safety could make
nuclear power an alternative to the oil and coal plants whose
emissions are implicated in theories of global warming.
   Though serious safety flaws remain in the construction and
operation of Soviet reactors, basic nuclear science has long
been one of Moscow's few technological strong points, partly
because of its kinship to nuclear-weapons research. Soviet
successes have included the first nuclear reactor in Europe
(the U.S. was first in the world); the first reactor designed
to produce electricity; and the first "tokamak," a machine
used in studies of nuclear fusion.
   Now, Soviet officials say they aim to design reactors at
least 100 times safer than today's, implying there would be a
one-in-10-million chance of an accident that spewed radiation
outside the plant, as happened at Chernobyl. Such a goal may
require abandoning much of the reactor technology of both
East and West.
   The problem, according to the Soviet analysis, is that
reactor safety today relies too much on fallible human
operators and complex safety equipment, and not enough on
making the reactor's basic design accident-proof. Most
reactors in East and West are just bundles of hot uranium
fuel cooled by water; the resulting steam turns a standard
electricity-making turbine. The Chernobyl accident stemmed
from a flawed design that, with operator mistakes, let the
reactor run out of control. At Three Mile Island, operator
mistakes let the coolant water drain and the reactor
overheat.
   One solution under study in Moscow entails building
reactors underground, possibly in natural, watertight rock
formations. There, the effects of any accident and of
radiation leakage would be minimized. And a buried reactor
would be sheltered from such hazards as plane crashes and
earthquakes. U.S. engineers rejected a similar idea as too
costly years ago; but Soviet scientists, drawing on
construction techniques developed in Soviet mining, think the
expenses may be exaggerated.
   A more-radical safety approach would use molten lead as a
reactor coolant. The idea isn't as far out as it might seem:
Already, in a few so-called "fast" reactors in the Soviet
Union, the U.S. and France, molten sodium metal is used as a
coolant. It works because the metal, though hot, is still
cooler than the reactor core. But it has a big problem of its
own: Sodium reacts violently with water or air. Sodium leaks
have already caused small explosions at Soviet and French
fast reactors.
   Lead would be safer, Soviet scientists argue. It doesn't
react violently. And it would be unlikely to leak out and
allow reactor overheating, says Prof. Victor Orlov, deputy
director of Moscow's Research and Development Institute of
Power Engineering. Any leak would quickly plug itself as the
escaping lead cooled and solidified, he says. Moscow already
powers some of its submarines with reactors cooled by a
mixture of molten lead and bismuth. Western nuclear subs are
water-cooled.
   There are drawbacks: Without safeguards, the hot lead
could gradually corrode its steel piping, or poison reactor
workers. But the idea intrigues U.S. engineers enough to
consider accepting a Soviet offer of collaboration. The lead
idea "certainly is credible," says James Laidler, engineering
research director at Argonne National Laboratory, a major
U.S. Energy Department laboratory.
   Despite the Soviet public's post-Chernobyl distaste for
nuclear power, Moscow already has about 150 scientists and
engineers studying the concept. After Chernobyl, "We have
very strong opposition to construction of a nuclear reactor.
We have no opposition to research on it," says Mikhail
Troyanov, director of the Obninsk research center.
