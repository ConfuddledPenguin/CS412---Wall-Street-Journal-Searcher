   Marriott Corp. said in Washington that it signed a
licensing agreement to develop 70 Nathan's Famous Inc.
fast-food restaurant units over the next five years.
   The first two outlets are scheduled to open in New York's
La Guardia Airport and the Neshaminy Travel Plaza on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike within three months.

   Financial terms weren't disclosed, but Marriott said the
agreement gives the lodging and food services company
exclusive development rights to the Nathan's Famous concept
at airports, travel plazas and certain food service
operations in the U.S. and Canada.
   Marriott said that, in preparation for the contract, it
operated two Nathan's Famous test sites last year on the
Florida Turnpike.
