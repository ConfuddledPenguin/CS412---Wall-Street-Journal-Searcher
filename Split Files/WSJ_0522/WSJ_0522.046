   In "Broadcasters Want Cable to Pay for Airing Their
Shows," March 29, you wrote that "cable systems have blithely
pulled down the satellite signals beamed by broadcasters and
retransmitted the fare . . . without paying a dime for it."
In fact, the cable industry paid more than $200 million in
copyright fees for carrying satellite and other distant
broadcast signals last year. The broadcasting industry widely
advertises itself as "free TV." When local stations do
transmit their signals over the air for "free," local cable
systems carry the local signals without charge. In 1974, the
Supreme Court recognized that cable serves only as an antenna
for these local signals, and it rejected an antenna tax.
