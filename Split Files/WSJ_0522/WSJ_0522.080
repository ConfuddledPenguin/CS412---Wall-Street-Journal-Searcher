   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said it has reached
final agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. on the sale of
its BancNewEngland Leasing Group.
   Under terms of the accord, Bank of Tokyo will buy
approximately $500 million of BancNewEngland's portfolio
assets.

   Bank of New England had previously stated that it would
receive a premium of $92.5 million for the assets. But a BNE
spokesman said the premium amount "has been downsized
somewhat." The new figure wasn't disclosed.
   The bank said the sale virtually completes its asset sales
program, with the exception of affiliate banks in Maine and
Rhode Island.
