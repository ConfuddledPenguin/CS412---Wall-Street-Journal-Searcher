   ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp. said it reached a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a
previously disclosed review by the agency.
   Sundstrand said the SEC yesterday filed a complaint in
federal district court here, charging that the company's
financial reports for the 1980 through 1986 "failed to
include proper disclosure of the events that formed the basis
of previously resolved criminal actions against the company,
and that Sundstrand's financial accounting systems were
deficient during that period."

   In 1988, Sundstrand pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud
against the defense department and agreed to pay $115 million
in fines.
   While "neither admitting nor denying the SEC's charges,"
Sundstrand said it consented to the entry of a permanent
injunction that blocks it from violating securities law in
the future.
   Sundstrand said it also agreed to have a special committee
of independent directors "consider whether the matters in
connection with which Sundstrand pled guilty to criminal
charges had resulted in any violations of the federal
securities laws beyond those alleged in the SEC's complaint."
   The settlement, which remains subject to approval by the
court, concludes the SEC's investigation of Sundstrand, the
company said.
   Sundstrand said it settled with the SEC "in order to avoid
protracted and costly litigation over practices long since
discontinued," and added that the settlement will have "no
financial impact" on the firm.
