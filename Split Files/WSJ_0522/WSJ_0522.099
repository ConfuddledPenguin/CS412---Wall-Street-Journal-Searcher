   To hear some brokers tell it, it's time for a strategy
tune-up for playing one of the most popular new investments
to come out of Wall Street in several years.
   But what they're proposing may not be a smart move.

   The investments are eight warrants, traded on the American
Stock Exchange, that allow investors to bet on the Japanese
stock market. Since the first were issued in January and
February of this year, the warrants have at times accounted
for as much as 40% of the Amex's daily volume.
   Six are put warrants, which pay off in dollars if the
Nikkei index of 225 Tokyo stocks falls below specified levels
before the warrants expire in nearly three years. There are
also two call warrants, which pay off if the Nikkei is above
specified levels three years hence.
   Now, with the Japanese stock market up nearly 10% since
this past winter's plunge, some brokers are encouraging
investors who purchased the put warrants when they were first
offered to sell them. To replace them, these brokers say,
investors should buy new, lower-priced puts brought out by
PaineWebber Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in April. They urge
investors who are joining the warrant game for the first time
to do the same.
   The brokers' main argument is that the new warrants
provide more leverage than the older ones. That is, if the
Nikkei index drops, say, 30% from current levels, prices of
the new put warrants would shoot up roughly 130%, while the
first-issued warrants would gain only about 50%.
   Prices of the put warrants issued in January and February
zoomed 200% on the Nikkei's 25% decline. "The timing and
pricing of the put warrants that came out in January and
February was perfect," says Michael Schwartz, a vice
president and option strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Despite the brokers' arguments, however, it isn't
necessarily wise to shun the older warrants for those more
recently issued. For one thing, the newer warrants are
cheaper only because the Nikkei's plunge made the specified
levels on which payouts are based about 20% lower than for
the older warrants. The Nikkei has to drop below that lower
level before there will be any money paid out at expiration.
The newer warrants are appealing mainly to investors who are
quite bearish on Japanese stocks.
   Moreover, the put warrants issued earlier are now selling
at a slight premium to their "intrinsic value." That simply
means the Nikkei already is at a level that would pay off
when the warrants expire -- which makes the older warrants a
bit of a bargain compared with the newer ones. (Calculating
intrinsic value exactly requires a formula, included in each
warrant's prospectus, that involves the current and future
payout levels of the Nikkei index, a divisor and either a
specified or current value of the Japanese yen in dollars.)
   The newer put warrants have no intrinsic value. They
simply provide the investor with nearly three years for the
Nikkei to decline and profit the warrant holder. The table
accompanying this article shows the intrinsic value for all
the Japanese put and call warrants currently trading, as well
as their market premium and the percentage by which the
Nikkei would have to move for the warrants' prices to double.
   Another consideration is leverage. If the Nikkei moves in
the wrong direction for the warrant holder, the decline in
the warrants' price can be several times the percentage
change in the index. Moreover, if the Nikkei hovers above the
specified level when the warrant's life runs out, the warrant
will expire worthless. Ditto for a call warrant based on an
index that's below the specified level at expiration.
   The table shows that if the Nikkei rallies 10% from its
current level, holders of the older put warrants would lose
less at expiration than holders of the newer, lower-priced
ones, who would see their entire investment wiped out.
However, another big plunge in the Nikkei gives the profit
advantage to the more highly leveraged newer put warrants.
   The two call warrants that came out last month are both
carrying premiums of more than 100% over their intrinsic
worth. The Nikkei would have to climb about 16% for
purchasers to break even at expiration, which makes the calls
a bad play for investors who believe the Japanese market is
going to rally over the next three years, counsels Mr.
Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Instead, he suggests buying shares
in a mutual fund, such as Japan Fund, and then buying
recently issued puts to protect that investment against a big
drop in the Japanese market.
   Investors who believe Japanese stocks aren't going
anywhere over the next three years might consider selling
short the new, low-priced calls, which have little intrinsic
value, and puts, which have none. That would require
borrowing the calls and puts to sell them, agreeing to buy
some later for replacement.
   Actually, the investor hopes to have to buy few, if any.
With this strategy, little movement in the Nikkei would cause
the warrants to expire worthless, or nearly so; that would
let the investor keep most of the proceeds from the warrants'
sale. Such a scheme, however, carries unlimited risk if the
Nikkei makes a very strong move either up or down.

   NIKKEI PUT WARRANTS' potential gains in the event of a 30%
drop in the Nikkei index of 225 Tokyo stocks were understated
by 100 percentage points in a story and an accompanying table
in yesterday's edition because of a miscalculation. For
example, in the case of the Denmark put, the gain from the
May 18 level would be 148% (instead of 48%); in the case of
the newer PaineWebber put, the gain would be 242% (not 142%).
