   WASHINGTON -- Rejecting a multimillion dollar oil-industry
lobbying effort, key House lawmakers agreed on provisions
that would require the use of cleaner gasoline in the
nation's nine smoggiest areas.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the main trade group for
the major oil companies, immediately blasted the accord as
"inflexible and possibly unworkable" and said it would
continue to seek changes. But the industry faces an uphill
battle. The compromise, which is similar to provisions in the
clean-air legislation approved by the Senate last month, is
expected to win approval on the House floor.

   The House began debating clean-air legislation yesterday,
and leaders expect the measure to be approved before the
Memorial Day recess.
   Besides requiring millions of Americans to begin using
more expensive, less polluting fuel, the measure would mean a
boon for companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and the
Arco Chemical Co. unit of Atlantic Richfield Co. that make
additives used to clean up gasoline. Commerce committee staff
members said the compromise could raise the cost of fuel in
those areas as much as five cents a gallon.
   Negotiators also settled on provisions aimed at reducing
air pollution in national parks, tightening enforcement and
strengthening the investigation of accidental emissions from
chemical plants. There already was substantial agreement in
the House on tailpipe-emission curbs, acid-rain controls and
toxic-emission releases from industrial facilities, among
other major issues. The bill is expected to impose about $20
billion a year in costs to industry.
   Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) said, "In terms of writing a strong, workable piece of
national environmental legislation, the overwhelming majority
of the work has been done."
   Among issues still unresolved are whether to require the
production and sale of cars that run on non-gasoline fuels in
the nine smoggiest areas and whether to speed up the
phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that
deplete the Earth's protective ozone layer. Both amendments
are strongly supported by environmentalists, but oppposed by
industry and are expected to be hard fought on the floor.
Among other complaints, the auto industry has argued that
there wouldn't be a market for non-gasoline fueled cars.
   Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.), the chief GOP sponsor of the
Bush administration's clean-air bill, warned that approval of
those provisions and another that would provide aid to
workers put out of work by the legislation could make the
measure unacceptable to the White House. The president
originally proposed requiring the production of non-gasoline
fueled cars, but the administration has since backed away
from the provision.
   The reformulated gasoline provisions are based on an
amendment sponsored by Rep. Bill Richardson (D., N.M.) and
Rep. Edward Madigan (R., Ill.). In an interview yesterday,
Rep. Richardson called the compromise "a major environmental
initiative that both cleans up the air and, I think, makes
the oil companies serious about reformulated gasoline."
   Although major oil companies have pushed reformulated
gasoline in an effort to head off requirements for cleaner,
non-gasoline fuels such as methanol, they have vigorously
opposed the Richardson approach. In a massive advertising
campaign, they contended that the original measure would go
too far in telling them how to produce fuel, would raise
costs to consumers and wouldn't clean up smog.
   Under the compromise, special gasoline would have to be
sold in the New York metropolitan area, the Hartford-New
Haven, Conn., area, Los Angeles, Houston, Milwaukee, San
Diego, Chicago, Baltimore and Philadelphia. Other areas that
don't meet federal health guidelines for smog could elect to
join the program, although the Environmental Protection
Agency could delay a city's ability to join if doing so
causes a gasoline supply problem.
   The fuel would have to yield specific environmental
benefits. For 1992 and 1993, the legislation would spell out
the fuel's oxygen and benzene content, among other
requirements.
   Then, emissions of smog-producing and toxic chemicals
would have to be cut 15% in 1994, 20% in 1997 and 25% in
2000, compared with today's gasoline. The legislation spells
out a formula for producing the gasoline for each of these
years, but the oil companies wouldn't have to adhere to the
formula unless it was shown to yield benefits even greater
than those required by the legislation.
   Regardless of whether they rely on the legislation's
formula, the oil firms probably would clean up gasoline in
part by increasing the use of oxygenate additives such as
ethanol and methyl tertiary-butyl ether, which is made from
methanol. Archer-Daniels-Midland is a large producer of
ethanol, while Arco Chemical is a major producer of MTBE.
   The accord on cleaning up national parks would require the
EPA to identify and regulate the source of haze in western
national parks within two years. The government also would
have to conduct studies of certain western power plants to
trace their emissions. In addition, there are provisions
designed to increase the pollution protection given to some
relatively new parks, including some in Alaska.
   "For more than a decade our spectacular parks and scenic
vistas have been hounded by man-made pollution," said Rep.
Ron Wyden (D. Ore.), the sponsor of the original park
amendment. "Now we have a chance to reverse this damage."
   Separately, the House Ways and Means Committee is seeking
to propose an amendment that would remove or modify some of
the fees in the clean-air legislation. Some Commerce
Committee lawmakers contend this effort could threaten
significant portions of the measure.
