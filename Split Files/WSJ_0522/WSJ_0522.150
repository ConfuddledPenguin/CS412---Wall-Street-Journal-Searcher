   WASHINGTON -- The chances of recession have declined
within the past three months and the current business
expansion will break the postwar record for longevity,
according to a survey of business economists.
   Not only did 82% of the panel forecast no recession
through 1991, but two-thirds of the group foresaw no
recession at all during the next three years. If that
prediction were to materialize, the current expansion -- now
90 months -- would break the February 1961-December 1969
record for the longest postwar period of economic growth.

   The quarterly survey of 68 members of the National
Association of Business Economists reflects forecasts made in
April and May.
   Although there will be no recession, the economists say,
the outlook for 1990 is for slower economic growth than in
1989. They expect the economy to grow an inflation-adjusted
2% this year, compared with 3% in 1989. For 1991, they expect
growth of 2.4%.
   The outlook for inflation this year is slightly bleaker,
too. The panel is forecasting a 4.7% rise in the consumer
price index this year. In a winter survey, they projected a
4.2% inflation rate. In 1989, consumer prices rose 4.6%.
   The panel said its forecasters are significantly less
optimistic about growth and interest rates than the Bush
administration.
