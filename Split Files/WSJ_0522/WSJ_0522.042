   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Consilium Inc. expects to report
that net income for the fiscal second quarter ended April 31
surged 80%, indicating that profit for the period totaled
about $1.38 million, Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer Mark Finkel said.
   Consilium makes computer software designed to help
manufacturers manage their production processes.

   Mr. Finkel said the company's per-share earnings are
expected to be in line with analysts' estimates of 19 to 20
cents. In the year-ago quarter, Consilium earned $766,000, or
14 cents a share. Consilium has about 6.9 million shares
outstanding, compared with 5.3 million a year earlier.
   Mr. Finkel projected revenue for the quarter of more than
$8 million, up 38% from $5.8 million a year earlier.
   Mr. Finkel said sales of the company's main software
product, WorkStream, are booming, particularly overseas.
International sales accounted for about 25% of the company's
second-quarter revenue, he said.
   He said the company is targeting new markets, particularly
the defense and aerospace markets. Mr. Finkel said the
company may actually benefit from the declines in defense
spending that is expected in coming years as a result of the
collapse of Eastern Europe's communist regimes.
   "It will be an increasingly difficult business for defense
companies and they'll need to control costs," he said. "Our
products help do just that."
   Mr. Finkel said the company has a new product in
development with Digital Equipment Corp. targeted for
manufacturers of such items as consumer electronics and
automotive parts. The product, expected to be on the market
late this year, could provide Consilium with a significant
boost in sales, Mr. Finkel said.
   He said the company doesn't have any debt. It had equity
at the end of its fiscal first quarter of $24.7 million. For
its full fiscal year, Mr. Finkel said the company expects
revenue of about $32 million, about 40% above year-ago
levels.
