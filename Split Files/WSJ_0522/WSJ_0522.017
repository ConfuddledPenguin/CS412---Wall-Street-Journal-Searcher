   IRS REGULATIONS on pension plans promise headaches for
major employers.
   After more than three years of deliberation, the IRS has
finally published what it hails as "simplified" rules for
assuring that pension and profit-sharing plans don't
discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. But
they "are not the panacea everyone hoped they would be," says
Frederick Rumack of Buck Consultants. The 401(a)(4) rules, as
they are known, "don't give us much opportunity to design
plans without going through hoops," he asserts.

   Most major companies, especially those with
defined-benefit plans, will have to either cut the total
value of their packages or raise benefits to lower-paid
workers. Or the companies could submit to some complex annual
tests that they would probably fail, requiring changes
anyway, particularly in how pensions are integrated with
Social Security benefits. Smaller companies -- without an
army of consultants and actuaries to call on -- probably will
try to comply by adopting a so-called "safe harbor" rule that
sets out a supposedly easy route to compliance.
   Such an election, though, could lower the tax-qualified
benefits top earners would receive, Mr. Rumack says.
                                                                                                       

   ENJOY MEMORIAL DAY] It's the last long weekend until Labor
Day.
   With July 4 falling on a Wednesday this year, just about
every company will be braving through Independence Day week
by trying to maintain normal operations that Monday and
Tuesday and then again the following Thursday and Friday. If
you dream of a five-day weekend, forget it, unless you plan
on using vacation days, which many are doing at Westinghouse
Electric Corp.
   Proler International Inc. anticipates some workers will
break away early July 3. But it hopes they'll return July 5
rejuvenated from the mid-week break. Raytheon Co. suspects
some may try to extend the holiday by calling in sick. But it
says absenteeism would be worse if the holiday fell on a
Tuesday or Thursday. Still, few companies want to make
Independence Day a Monday holiday. "Are you kidding?"
Dennison Manufacturing Co. asks.
                                                                                                       

   IBM SCORES top marks for its human-resource policies.
   In a survey sponsored by the computer maker -- though the
participants didn't know it -- human-resource executives at
142 companies rated International Business Machines Corp.
among the leaders in every personnel area assessed. No other
company came close. In all, the survey by consultant Towers
Perrin asked the executives to name leaders in 18 individual
categories, including compensation and recruiting, and four
overall classifications: effectiveness, internationality,
leadership and innovation.
   IBM was cited by at least 5% to 10% of the respondents,
depending on the question, in 17 of the individual
categories. Leaders in health education weren't identified
because there were too few of them. IBM also was listed as a
leader in the four overall characteristics. Only Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. also was cited in the four overall
groups. It was among the leaders in 12 of the individual
categories.
   General Electric Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Merck &amp; Co.
also ranked high for their policies.
                                                                                                       

   THE SURVEY and a companion poll in Japan show managers in
both countries give top priority to executive development and
recruiting. But a third major concern of the Americans is
compensation; for the Japanese, it's work-force planning.
                                                                                                       

   GOLDEN PARACHUTES float over big companies; 43% of them
protect executives in the event of a hostile takeover,
consultant Towers Perrin says. But just 26% of midsized firms
offer the coverage, though their size may make them more
vulnerable.
                                                                                                       

   BUSINESS TRAVELERS spend less, despite rising travel
costs. Consultant Runzheimer International puts outlays at
$6,250 a year, off 7.1% from 1988, because travelers
consolidate trips and hunt for discounts.
                                                                                                       

   DON'T BLAME leveraged buy-outs. Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. says there's no link between the increased number of
firms going private and the rise in the number of pension
plans terminated to recover excess assets.
                                                                                                       

   ENVIRONMENTAL CHIEFS get broader exposure at many
companies.
   Scott Paper Co. creates the post of senior vice president
for environmental affairs to "raise the visibility of
environmental issues within the corporation." A forestry
manager, Stephen Conway, gets the job. Dow Chemical Co. picks
David Buzzelli, a chemical engineer who headed its Canadian
operations, to fill its new environment, health and safety
vice presidency. Hercules Inc. hires Marshall Steinberg, a
toxicologist, as its latest environment watcher.
   But finding executives for the top posts can be a daunting
challenge, says recruiter Paul McCartney of Paul R. Ray &amp; Co.
"It's a needle-in-the-haystack hunt to find someone with both
the understanding of environmental issues and enough industry
experience to help the company," he says.
   Chevron Corp. concurs "very few people could come up
through the ranks because the jobs didn't exist."
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: College seniors think they are so well
prepared for their first jobs they will have to endure few
clerical or "gofer" duties, CareerVision Information Centers
says. . . . New Trier High School in Winnetka, Ill., stages
"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" with women
as bosses and men as secretaries, but it moves the setting to
2059 to make it believable.
