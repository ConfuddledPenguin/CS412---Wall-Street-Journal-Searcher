   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp., one of the leading bank
lenders for leveraged buy-outs, has quietly disbanded a
division that specialized in such transactions.
   While Bank of Boston has profited in the past from
leveraged transactions, the outlook is cloudier for some of
the recent deals it has helped finance, such as the
acquisitions of G. Heileman Brewing Co., Friendly Ice Cream
and Prime Computer Inc.

   The action, which bank spokesmen described as part of an
ongoing reorganization, underlines a growing wariness by
banks toward leveraged buy-outs. Many banks have recently
taken a more conservative approach to these loans -- partly
because of concerns that a slowing economy could spell
trouble for highly leveraged companies, but also because of
pressure from federal regulators and worried investors.
   Peter Manning, Bank of Boston's chief financial officer,
stressed that the bank intends to continue making loans for
so-called highly leveraged transactions, despite the
dissolution of the bank's acquisition-finance division. The
division, which included about 16 officers, made leveraged
buy-out loans to midsized companies that didn't fall into the
bailiwick of the bank's specialized-loan divisions.
   Those specialized divisions will continue to seek
acquisition loans in industries that the bank has
traditionally served, such as cable television, Mr. Manning
said.
   But Mr. Manning acknowledged that the bank's decision last
fall to tighten its criteria for highly leveraged
transactions, had left the acquisition-finance division with
"a thinner net" for landing deals. For example, the bank now
insists on keeping no more than $50 million of any individual
loan, selling off the remaining amount. Previously, the bank
would keep as much as $75 million of a loan.
   Some leveraged buy-out specialists say that, while many
banks have become more conservative about leveraged buy-out
lending, the pattern is particularly marked at Bank of
Boston. The company, in its first quarter earnings report,
noted that it made no new commitments for financing of highly
leveraged transactions during the period. Partly as a result,
the bank's portfolio of highly leveraged transaction
financings shrank to $4.8 billion at March 31 from $5.3
billion at Dec. 31. But the smaller total still represents
one of the biggest portfolios in the nation -- especially as
a proportion of the bank's total assets of $37 billion.
   The acquisition-finance division's officers, as well as
its assets, have been reassigned to other lending divisions.
Gail Long, who had headed the acquisition-finance division,
has since been put in charge of the larger national division,
handling corporate loans outside New England, a spokesman
said.
   Some of the assets from the acquisition-finance division
were placed in the bank's loan-workout division, the
spokesman said. But he and Mr. Manning insisted that the
proportion of troubled loans wasn't notably high, and that
the quality of the portfolio wasn't a reason for the decision
to disband the division. The division in previous years has
produced strong profits for the company, Mr. Manning said.
