   Yet more news on the outgoing Marxist tide. Formerly
Marxist South Yemen prepared over the weekend for its union
with capitalist North Yemen by knocking down statues of Lenin
and Marx in public squares. Building facades also lost such
embedded exhortations as, "No voice can be louder than the
voice of the Party." Meanwhile, across the ocean, a
"democracy flotilla" of 34 boats set sail from Key West to
Cuba. As they steamed six miles from Cuba's shore, a pleasure
boat elsewhere in the Florida Straits came upon two Cubans
fleeing Castro's paradise on an inner-tube raft. They were
turned over to U.S. immigration authorities.
