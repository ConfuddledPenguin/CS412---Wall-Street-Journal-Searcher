   This is in response to Jude Wanniski's April 10
editorial-page defense of a one-to-one exchange deal for East
German and West German marks. It brought to mind another
recent transaction:
   A man came to my house the other day to do some plumbing
work. He did good work, finished on time and came to me to be
paid. I complimented him on his work, thanked him and handed
over his pay. He was puzzled. "What's this?" he said.

   "That is your pay," I replied, and thanked him again.
   He looked at the notes in his palm, looked back at me and
said, "Yeah, but what is it?"
   "Why those are Johnsons, of course, and that is your pay.
Eight hundred twelve Johnsons (J812)."
   He said nothing, but continued to look at me -- and not
blankly, I might say. I realized quickly the source of his
confusion.
   "You have given me a bill for $116. The exchange rate for
Johnsons and dollars is seven to one. That was decided
sometime ago, and it has never changed. So I have given you
812 Johnsons." He kept looking at me and his brows lowered a
bit.
   "Johnsons," he said. "What's a Johnson?"
   "Why, it's the currency we use around here. Not everyone,
but me, and my neighbor to the right, and the folks on the
left two houses down, and the woman across the street,
although only sometimes."
   "What do I do with a Johnson?" he asked.
   I stifled a chuckle at his naivete and said, "Well, it's
money. Do whatever you want with it. Buy something, pay your
bills, give it as a present."
   "If I take these to the bank, can I get dollars for them?"
   "I don't think so," I said.
   He was plainly impressed by the fine quality of notes in
his hand. "Where do these come from?" he asked.
   I was becoming a bit impatient, but tried not to seem so.
"Mr. Fuller, across the street, makes them actually. He's a
master printer you know."
   "What the hell's going on here?" he said with more than a
hint of menace in his tone.
   "Look," I said, "you need to be paid, and I've paid you.
Now please take your Johnsons and go. Go buy something, if
that's what you want to do."
   "What can I buy with a Johnson?" he asked, now more
curious than threatening.
   "Buy anything you want. Something here, or next-door.
We've got lots of things: tools, food, clothing, sporting
goods, you name it."
   "I need boots," he said. "Do you have boots?"
   "Of course," I replied, "good ones, too, at a good price.
Regularly, J90; I can let you have them for J75."
   "I wear size 10s."
   "We don't have any of those. We have men's 15s and ladies'
6s and 12s, and there's one boys' size 8."
   "That's what my kid wears. I'll take those."
   "Not `those,'" I corrected him. "It. We have only one."
   "So what am I gonna do with my Johnsons?" he asked.
   "If you don't want to spend them on what's available,
perhaps you should save them. Deposit your Johnsons with Mr.
Fuller. He'll give you a far better rate than some other
bank, and he's more reliable than many of them, too. Your
bank probably pays five or six percent or something like
that. Mr. Fuller pays 19% on Johnsons. Deposit your Johnsons
now and in six months you'll have nearly J900."
   "Then what do I do with them?"
   "You could buy the boots, and if the price hasn't gone up,
you'll still have over J800 left. More than you started
with."
   "By then you'll have size 10s?"
   "Well, no. But we're pursuing monetary union with West
Germany, and demanding an exchange of Johnsons for marks at
one to one. If you work hard and reinvest, you can get more
Johnsons. Mr. Fuller says he is going to run off lots of
them."
   "I don't know," he said. "Who knows what West German marks
will be worth after this reunification business?"
   "Good point," I acknowledged. "Might want to hold on to
your Johnsons."
