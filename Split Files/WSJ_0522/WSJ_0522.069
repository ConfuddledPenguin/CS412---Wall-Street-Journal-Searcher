   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is concerned about the strength of
Japan's commitment to the Structural Impediments Initiative
talks, said Charles Dallara, Treasury assistant secretary for
international affairs.
   Senior U.S. and Japanese officials this week meet in
Hawaii to resume the SII talks, a year-long dialogue designed
to break down barriers to a bilateral economic relationship.

   "There's some growing concern about the apparent
willingness of the Japanese government to move forward and
make the final SII report a successful report," said Mr.
Dallara, one of the co-heads of the U.S. delegation to
Hawaii. "There are signs of some hesitation and reluctance on
their part."
   The U.S. and Japan on April 5 concluded an interim report
on the SII that both sides heralded as a great success. As
part of that report, Japan agreed to open up its retailing
system, boost public works spending, loosen its clubby
business practices, and strengthen antitrust legislation and
patent protection. Tokyo also said it would relax restrictive
land-use policies and restraints on foreign investment.
   The U.S. promised to encourage savings, improve education,
expand research and development, promote exports and cut the
federal deficit. The April 5 interim agreement, which is
expected to lead to a final SII report in July, was important
to ensuring that Japan avoided being named an unfair trader
under this year's Super 301 determination announced at the
end of April. Super 301 is a tough provision of the 1988
Trade Act that requires the administration to designate
unfair traders whose practices harm U.S. exporters'
prospects.
   The U.S., just a few weeks after letting Japan off the
hook, is now particularly concerned about the issue of
savings and investment. Japan needs "to boost infrastructure
investment," a senior Treasury official explained. There are
also continuing problems with close "keiretsu" links between
Japanese companies, which can promote anticompetitive
business practices and preferential group trade.
