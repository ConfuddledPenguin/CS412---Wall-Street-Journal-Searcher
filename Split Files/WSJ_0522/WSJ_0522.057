   Preston Townley, Conference Board president, to the
Montreal Board of Trade on April 11:

   When we plan meetings, we have waiting lists of executives
ready to extol their successes. But good failures are hard to
come by. . . . In fact, I can just about guarantee anyone in
this audience a keynote speaking engagement if you are
willing to tell how you fell on your face with your marketing
plan last year.
