   Nova Corp. of Alberta said it agreed to sell its rubber
operations to Bayer AG of West Germany for 1.25 billion
Canadian dollars (US$1.06 billion).
   The purchase price is at the high end of analysts'
expectations, but the sale of the assets isn't seen by all as
a good move.

   When the Calgary, Alberta, company announced it was
seeking buyers for the rubber operations, the investment
community was divided. Some analysts worried that the company
was getting rid of its crown jewel and a major source of cash
flow that wasn't dependent on the cyclical swings of the
petrochemical and pipeline industries, Nova's core
businesses. Others said they expected the sale to boost the
value of Nova's shares, which has languished in recent
months.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Nova closed up 50 cents a share to $7.375, well off its
52-week high of $9.50.
   The rubber division is part of Polysar Ltd. that Nova
acquired in 1988 for C$1.3 billion. Nova said it expects to
either break even or report a small gain on the sale.
   Nova acquired Polysar at the peak of the petrochemicals
cycle. The company's earnings took a dive and its share price
followed. Robert Hastings, an analyst with Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd., said if Nova can pull a small
gain out of the sale of the rubber division, it will have
done all right.
   William G. Wilson, Nova's chief financial officer, said
Bayer will assume C$100 million of the rubber division's debt
and C$130 million in other liabilities.
   Analysts said the move is strategically important to Bayer
because it will give it a much bigger presence in the large
U.S. market. But they said the rubber division comes to Bayer
at a high price, particularly because of the current weakness
in the auto industry, a chief client to rubber products
makers.
   "Let's just say they didn't underpay; 1.3 times sales is a
very full price," said Alasdair Nisbet, a chemicals analyst
with London's UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
   Nova's Mr. Wilson said Bayer was "prepared to pay that
strategic premium" for access to the North American market.
   The sale to Bayer has already raised the ire of at least
one other potential bidder. Enimont S.p.A. of Italy said it
was invited to bid for the Polysar division but was prevented
from doing so because of the announced sale. An Enimont
spokeswoman said the proposed sale to Bayer didn't respect
the bidding rules. She said bids were due yesterday, but the
announcement yesterday morning made the competitive bids
obsolete.
   Bayer, which has interests in chemicals, health care and
imaging technologies, said it "will maintain, and may expand"
Polysar's main facility in Sarnia, Ontario.
   Nova's rubber division is a leading producer of synthetic
rubber, primarily for the tire industry. It contributed C$812
million to Nova's 1989 sales of C$4.84 billion and expects
sales of C$900 million this year. The division has plants in
Canada, the U.S., Belgium and France with combined annual
capacity of about 530,000 tons. Bayer's rubber production
capacity totals only 150,000 tons a year.
   Bayer said it has had preliminary discussions with
officials of Investment Canada and will be submitting its
application to them in the near future. It hopes to close the
transaction this fall.
   Nova said it will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce
its debt. At the end of 1989, the company's long-term debt
stood at about C$3.8 billion.
   The rubber division was just one of several blocks of Nova
assets up for sale. The company put four small companies on
the block last June with a combined value of C$500 million
and has had little luck finding buyers. Nova said recently
that it is also considering a public offering of shares in
its affiliate, Husky Oil Ltd., a large oil and natural gas
producer that analysts value at C$1.5 billion.
   Analysts say the company is selling the assets in an
attempt to improve earnings. In the first quarter, Nova had
net income of C$36 million, or 11 Canadian cents a share, on
revenue of C$1.20 billion, compared with net of C$129
million, or 51 Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$1.30
billion a year earlier.
   Mr. Hastings, the Richardson Greenshields analyst, said
the rubber division sale will definitely improve Nova's
earnings, and increase its ability to get financing. However,
he said the company is "a little bit more cyclical than they
were yesterday."
