   Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., Baltimore, requested an
annual rate increase of 12.1% or $198 million in an
application filed with the Maryland Public Service
Commission.
   The increase requests includes $45 million, proposed as
the first part of a three-stage phase-in of revenues required
for the commercial operation of a second generating unit at
its Brandon Shores Power Plant. The plant is scheduled for
completion in June 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two remaining phases are designed so customers won't pay
any more during 1991 than they would have under a traditional
single increase approach, the company said.
