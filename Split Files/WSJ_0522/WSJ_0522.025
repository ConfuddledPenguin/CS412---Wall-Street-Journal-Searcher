   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- International Rectifier Corp. and
Siliconix Inc. said they reached agreement on
patent-infringement litigation concerning International
Rectifier's power-transistor technology.
   Under terms of the accord, Siloconix, of Santa Clara,
Calif., will pay International Rectifier $12 million over a
two-year period and will acquire a royalty-bearing license
under the litigated patents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Siliconix filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
Federal bankruptcy code April 10 after a U.S. district court
held valid all five of International Rectifier's patents on
the power-transistor technology. Implementation of the
agreement is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court.
   Siliconix supplies advanced semiconductor products.
International Rectifier supplies power semiconductors and
other products. The litigation had been pending since 1986.
