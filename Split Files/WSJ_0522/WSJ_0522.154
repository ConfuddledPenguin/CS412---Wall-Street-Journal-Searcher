   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The United Auto Workers union will
demand that the Big Three U.S. auto makers follow Japanese
car companies in providing practically unconditional job
guarantees to workers, Owen Bieber, UAW president, announced.
   Mr. Bieber was speaking at the opening of the union's
convention to set bargaining priorities in this summer's
national contract negotiations.

   He said that the Big Three should keep blue-collar workers
on the payroll "unless {the companies'} ability to survive is
severely at risk as a result of conditions beyond their
control." This language mirrors clauses negotiated by the UAW
with Mazda Motor Corp.'s U.S. plant, the Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. and Chrysler Corp. joint venture plant in Illinois, and
the General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. joint venture
factory in Fremont, Calif.
   Further, Mr. Bieber said the UAW will push to give workers
at Big Three factories more say in areas that management has
traditionally regarded as its exclusive province -- product
design and factory operations. These concepts, too, are
common at the Japanese-operated plants.
   Company officials have complained in recent weeks that
Japanese "transplants" have a substantial cost advantage
because they have either nonunion shops, or have far more
flexible agreements with the UAW.
   Mr. Bieber countered that providing secure jobs would help
the Big Three "as they discovered what fully motivated, fully
secure workers can contribute to their success."
   But Mr. Bieber also appeared to leave open a door for the
Big Three to reduce their manpower levels to match their
smaller market shares. By equating income security with job
security he signaled that the union may tolerate further job
losses if laid-off workers are paid full wages and benefits
for a reasonable time after losing their jobs.
   Currently, the UAW and the Big Three have a patchwork of
programs that provide income for laid off employees. But
there have been so many layoffs, particularly at GM and
Chrysler, that the funds designed to pay these benefits are
being drained faster than expected. The result is that many
employees receive less money than anticipated.
   In a draft bargaining platform, the UAW said the current
income-security system needs to be "revamped and improved in
many ways."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Bieber tried to head off a divisive
internal battle over the issue of putting UAW pensions on a
cost-of-living escalator. A sizable faction of delegates
wants the union to make cost of living adjustments, or COLA,
for pensions the top bargaining priority.
   Buttons and placards demanding COLA on pensions are ever
present at the sprawling Kansas City convention center, where
the meeting is being held. Many of the COLA supporters say
they are ready to fight the leadership on the convention's
floor.
   Mr. Bieber, who in the past has pooh-poohed as unrealistic
the notion of COLA on pensions, was more conciliatory on the
issue yesterday. He added language supporting improved
pensions to his prepared speech. And he criticized GM for its
proposal to almost double the pension of departing Chairman
Roger B. Smith and other executives, declaring that UAW
retirees deserved "decency and fair treatment . . . and we
won't settle without it."
   But Mr. Bieber stopped short of endorsing a straight
inflation adjustment for pensions. The pension issue was only
fourth on the leadership's list of five negotiating demands,
subject to convention approval. The first three are job
security, higher wages, and maintaining full health-care
benefits. The fifth demand is more worker involvement in
decisions.
