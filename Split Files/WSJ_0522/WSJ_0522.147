   Metro International AG, a Swiss-German retailing group,
said it is considering making a joint bid with two partners
for a majority stake in Co op AG -- a Frankfurt/Main, West
Germany-based food retailer.
   Metro's partners are Lonrho PLC, a London-based industrial
and trading conglomerate, and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG, a
Saarbrucken, West Germany-based retailing concern.

   Metro didn't disclose any details on the offer for Co op.
The three companies received financial information on Co op
last Thursday and now have to study the data before making
any further decision, Metro said.
   Metro's announcement essentially confirmed reports by
industry sources over the weekend that Metro and Lonrho are
preparing a joint offer for Co op.
   According to industry sources, Metro, Lonrho and Asko are
willing to pay 400 million marks ($147.4 million) for Co op,
including its debt of more than 500 million marks.
