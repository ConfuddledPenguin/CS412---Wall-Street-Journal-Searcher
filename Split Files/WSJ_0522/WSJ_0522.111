   Perry Drug Stores Inc., Pontiac, Mich., said it agreed to
acquire 16 Detroit-area stores operated by Revco Drug Stores
Inc. of Twinsburg, Ohio. The price wasn't disclosed.
   Perry's purchase is part of a larger transaction, in which
Revco is selling 221 stores through Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings to Reliable Drug Stores Inc. of Indianapolis.
Sixteen of these stores in turn would be sold to Perry. The
entire deal requires bankruptcy court approval, which is
expected in June, Perry said.

   The proposed acquisition supports Perry's strategy of
filling in existing markets and concentrating on Michigan,
said Jack A. Robinson, chairman and chief executive officer.
After the acquisition, Perry will operate 186 conventional
drugstores in Michigan and 23 in the Chicago area.
   Perry plans to open 20 stores in the current year and
expects to complete the divestiture of 14 A.L. Price
deep-discount stores by the end of this month.
