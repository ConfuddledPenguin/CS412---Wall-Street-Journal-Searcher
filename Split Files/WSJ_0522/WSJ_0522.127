   WASHINGTON -- In a move designed to boost public
confidence in medical tests, the Department of Health and
Human Services proposed new rules to certify the quality of
the nation's clinical laboratories.
   But the American Medical Association immediately
complained that the proposed rules represent a new layer of
complex and unnecessary regulation that will drive up the
cost of medical care.

   The 63-page proposal published in the Federal Register
yesterday requires that most labs, including those in
doctors' offices, be federally certified. The proposal puts
labs into three categories, depending on the complexity of
the testing involved and the danger of the disease being
screened.
   "Complex and high-risk tests, such as Pap smears, or
simpler tests with some risk, such as cholesterol screening,
will be subject to federal quality and proficiency
standards," explained Gail Wilensky, administrator of the
Health Care Financing Administration, the HHS unit that
oversees Medicare and Medicaid. "Simple, low-risk tests will
be on a waiver list, and labs performing only these tests
will be exempt from regulation." These simple tests include
urine pregnancy tests and certain screening for sickle-cell
anemia and infectious mononucleosis.
   Dr. James Todd, the AMA's acting executive vice president,
said the new rules are "just going to drive up costs
unbelievably." He predicted that many doctors will abandon
providing lab services to their patients, a move that could
reduce services, particularly in rural areas.
   The rules were required by the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988, which Congress passed after
disclosures in The Wall Street Journal of frequent
inaccuracies in the results of Pap smears taken to check for
cervical cancer, which kills 6,000 women a year.
   When adopted, the new rules will cover more than 300,000
labs, a huge expansion of current federal regulations that
cover some 12,000 labs. All labs that aren't waived from
regulation will be inspected every two years by the HCFA.
Labs that fail to comply with federal standards for quality
control, personnel qualifications and proficiency testing
could lose their certificates and face civil penalties.
   Under the law, only labs that are certified or waived from
certification will be able to receive payments from Medicare
and Medicaid, the federal health programs for the elderly and
the poor that pay about 40% of the nation's clinical lab
costs.
   Dr. Todd complained that the proposals interpret the law
too rigidly. "The waiver process is complicated, and the
number of tests that can be waivered is relatively small," he
said. "They could have applied the law much more
conservatively than they have."
   The public has until Aug. 20 to comment on the proposals.
Mrs. Wilensky said the list of 28 tests subject to waiver was
compiled "after careful consultation with the Public Health
Service and a host of outside experts. Nonetheless, we are
eager to receive additional comments."
