   HOUSTON -- American General Corp. said it "decisively"
defeated an alternative slate of directors proposed by
Torchmark Corp. at its annual meeting, but beat back a
nonbinding resolution seeking its sale by just a 56% to 42%
margin.
   Although the victory was hollow -- since the big insurance
and financial-services concern had already decided to put
itself up for sale anyway -- an American General spokesman
said the final tally "indicates our decision was totally
irrespective of the vote."

   Some analysts have speculated that the company decided to
place itself on the auction block mostly because of a poor
showing in the May 2 proxy contest. But American General has
maintained that it decided to open itself to bidders to avoid
being forced into a sale to Torchmark at a depressed price.
As reported, Torchmark, a Birmingham, Ala., insurer, offered
$50 a share, or $6.3 billion, for American General, before
launching its proxy fight.
   American General said preliminary results indicate
shareholders voted 2-to-1 to approve the company's nominees.
The slate includes three new outside directors -- Brady F.
Carruth, president and chief executive of Gulf Coast Capital
Corp.; Richard J.V. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of
the Houston Chronicle Publishing Co.; and Robert E.
Smittcamp, president and chief executive of Lyons-Magnus Co.
-- and three American General officers, including Harold S.
Hook, chairman and chief executive; Michael J. Poulous,
president; and Henry S. Romaine, vice chairman.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, American General closed at $49.125, unchanged.
