   NEW YORK -- Investors continued to bid up junk bond prices
yesterday, extending the high-yield rally into its third
week.
   Peter Karches, head of the high-yield department at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., said yesterday "was one of the more active
Mondays we've seen."

   Most junk bonds ended between 1/4 and 3/4 point higher, or
up as much as $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
Earlier in the day, junk bond prices had been as much as 1
1/2 points higher, but some late profit-taking clipped the
advance.
   Junk bonds are high-yielding corporate bonds that have low
credit ratings or no credit ratings. Among the biggest
gainers yesterday were Kroger Co.'s 12 7/8% senior
subordinated debentures due in 1999, which climbed 1/2 point
to end at 103 1/2; Owens-Illinois Inc.'s 12 1/4% senior
subordinated notes due in 1996, which jumped 3/4 point to end
at 91 1/2; and Duracell Holdings Corp.'s zero-coupon bonds,
which rose one point to close at 64.
   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s pay-in-kind bonds, which pay interest
in the form of more securities instead of cash, were also
strong advancers. The food and tobacco giant's 14.07%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures due in 2009 climbed 1 3/8
point to 85 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange, while the
14.07% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures added 7/8 to close
at 71 7/8.
   Analysts attribute the junk bond market's firmer tone to
forecasts of stronger corporate profits in the second half of
the year, a sharp decline in new-issue volume and a stronger
stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.77
points to a new high of 2844.68.
   But despite a steady upward climb that has lasted for more
than two weeks, most analysts aren't ready to pronounce a
junk bond market rebound.
   "It's a little premature to say that we're at the
beginning of a lasting rally in the high-yield market," said
John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service
Inc. But he added, "on the basis of recent price performance,
the upturn cannot be denied, and at least you have to state
that the market appears to have stabilized." Mr. Lonski said
Moody's index of 200 high-yield bonds has posted an
impressive gain of about 1.8% so far this month. That's a big
change from February, when the index posted a negative total
return of 3.5%.
   Traders and investors note that prices of many issues were
quoted higher yesterday, but little trading actually took
place because of a scarcity of supply.
   "A few months ago, everyone wanted to sell but there were
not enough buyers. Now everyone wants to buy but there are
not enough sellers," said Kevin Mathews, a portfolio manager
at Van Kampen Merritt. He said bonds bid for yesterday will
eventually be acquired, but possibly at higher prices. "The
bidding may start on a bond at 95 and the trade may happen
later at 98 or 99. That happens many times."
   Yesterday's junk bond gains were impressive considering
that the broader bond market, which is led by the
trillion-dollar U.S. Treasury sector, was unchanged to just
modestly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended
1/8 point higher, a gain of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield eased slightly to 8.68% from
8.69%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point
higher. The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price
of 100 20/32, up from 100 16/32 on Friday. Ten-year notes
ended unchanged at a price of 100 27/32 to yield 8.73%.
   The market was quiet with many traders and analysts
looking ahead to the government's auction of new two-year
notes tomorrow and five-year, two-month notes on Thursday.
   In when-issued trading activity, the two-year notes were
quoted at a yield of 8.61%. The five-year, two-month notes
were quoted at a yield of 8.68%.
   The government sold $8.40 billion of three-month Treasury
bills yesterday at an average discount rate of 7.74% and
$8.43 billion of six-month bills at an average discount rate
of 7.79%. The rates were up from last week's auction, when
they were 7.67% and 7.68%, respectively.
   Here are auction details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated May 24. The 13-week bills mature
Aug. 23, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 23.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, resumed their
upward climb with some issues rising as much as 5/8 point.
   Sentiment in the gilt market has been bolstered in recent
sessions largely by expectations that Britain will enter the
European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism in the
near future.
   Britain's 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007 rose 18/32
to 101 5/32 to yield 11.56%, while the 12% note due 1995 was
up 19/32 to 99 14/32 to yield 12.14%.
   The Japanese government bond market ended weaker as the
value of the yen fell against the dollar. Traders said there
also was some selling as market participants made room for
the new 10-year Japanese government bonds expected to be
auctioned Tuesday.
   West German government bonds also ended lower as investors
continued to shy away from the market. The benchmark 10-year
notes fell 1/4 point to par.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   After retracing slim declines seen earlier in the session,
tax-exempt issues were narrowly mixed, with some issues
trading 1/8 to 1/4 point higher in late dealings.
   While tax-exempt issues have continued to move within
narrow ranges as expected, traders attribute some of the
small gains posted during the session to the April U.S.
budget statement, which was slightly stronger than expected.
   A record $42.52 billion surplus was seen in April.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report had
forecast a $38.6 billion surplus. Surpluses are generally
expected in April, when income tax returns are filed.
   In new-issue activity, a Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. group priced
an issue of $55 million of Alabama Housing Finance
Authority's single-family mortgage revenue bonds.
   This week, more than $1.4 billion in new debt is expected
to be priced.
   In one of the largest deals, expected to generate a fair
amount of interest, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. group may price
$215 million of Battery Park City Authority revenue bonds
tomorrow.
   Proceeds from the bond sale, as much as $150 million,
would be turned over to New York City in a one-time transfer
of funds, said Chester Straub, corporate secretary for the
authority.
   Earlier this year, city officials had requested state
approval to receive the funds to help the city stave off
anticipated budget deficits.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 1/8 point at 97 1/2
bid to yield 7.39%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Investment-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged to
slightly higher.
   Among new issues, Unisys Corp. offered $300 million of
so-called credit sensitive notes priced to yield 10.30%.
   The notes offer a type of bondholder protection that
promises an increased coupon rate if the company's credit
rating is downgraded by one full ratings category. If the
company's credit rating is upgraded, the coupon rate is
lowered.
   According to underwriters at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the
issue sold well.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended narrowly mixed after quiet
dealings.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
June delivery finished at 95 7/32, unchanged; 9 1/2%
securities were at 97 23/32, up 1/32; 10% securities were at
100 6/32, down 1/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9
1/2% securities were at 97 9/32, up 2/32.
   In the mortgage derivative market, the Federal National
Mortgage Association issued a $300 million real estate
mortgage investment conduit backed by its 9 1/2% securities
through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a $200 million Remic
backed by principal-only strips outstanding through BT
Securities, the securities unit of Bankers Trust New York
Corp.
