   LONDON -- After several years of heady expansion, growth
in Western gold-mining production is coming to an end,
according to a study of gold-mining companies.
   Western gold output grew by 72% in the 1980s to a record
1,653 metric tons last year, says the report by Gold Fields
Mineral Services Ltd., a research joint venture of Newmont
Mining Corp., Gold Fields of South Africa and Renison
Goldfields Consolidated, an Australian mining company. A
metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.

   During the decade, North American output rose to 418
metric tons in 1989, compared with 82 tons in 1980; Latin
American mines produced 229 tons last year against 92 tons in
1980. Australian companies mined 197 tons in 1989 compared
with 17 tons 10 years ago. South African mine production,
however, fell to 608 tons from 675 tons at the beginning of
the '80s.
   A weak gold price, rising costs and a tax on gold-mining
profits in Australia will curb expansion during the 1990s,
according to the report.
   But the East bloc, which raised sales to 296 tons last
year from 263 tons, will "continue to be a major source of
supply" because the Soviet Union needs foreign exchange.
Nevertheless, mining difficulties in the Soviet Union are
likely to keep annual production of 300 tons virtually
static, says the author of the study, Stewart Murray.
   Following a surge in demand in Asia and Italy, however,
jewelry manufacturers bought about 96% of newly mined Western
gold last year, says the report.
   That consumption dipped when gold soared in the final
quarter last year, but has risen again following the renewed
price depression this year. Asian and Middle Eastern hoarders
are also buying more gold, the report says.
   The gold price failed to respond to the report's
optimistic conclusions, however, because disenchanted Western
investors are still sellers. Such was the disappointment of
European investors, for example, that they sold approximately
15 tons of coins last year.
