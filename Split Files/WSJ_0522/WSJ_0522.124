   DALLAS -- Five former officers of the defunct Independent
American Savings Association were accused in a lawsuit of
approving questionable loans and other investments that
caused losses of about $50 million at the thrift.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Dallas federal court by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., names former Democratic
fund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert and his brother, Jack R.
Gaubert, who were co-chairmen of Independent American.

   Also named in the suit are the thrift's former chief
executive officer, Tommy G. Lane of Arlington, Texas; former
president, Jerry G. Payne of Dallas; and former vice
president for finances, John W. Brophy, a Dallas accountant.
   The suit, which seeks $150 million in punitive damages in
addition to the $50 million in actual damages, accuses the
former officers of conspiring to defraud the thrift by
directing questionable loans to business associates and by
buying portions of nonperforming loans from other thrifts to
help conceal those thrifts' losses from regulators. Only two
of the loans in question were made while Thomas M. Gaubert
was co-chairman of Independent American. The two loans, which
allegedly caused losses of $2 million each, were made before
Mr. Gaubert relinquished control of the thrift in 1984 in an
agreement with federal regulators.
   The FDIC lawsuit is the latest filed in a spate of
litigation between Mr. Gaubert and federal thrift regulators.
Mr. Gaubert is suing the government in two courts for
personal losses he suffered in the government takeover of
Independent American, and he won acquittal in October 1988 on
loan-fraud charges related to an Iowa thrift. Mr. Gaubert's
attorney, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., said the
FDIC's new lawsuit is "retaliation" for his client's
lawsuits.
   "Like so many of the FDIC lawsuits, it promises in its
complaint more than it will ever produce in court," Mr.
Lowell said.
   Jack Gaubert's attorney, Robert M. Greenberg, said he
hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment. The other
defendants couldn't be reached for comment.
   The suit was filed almost three years to the day after
federal thrift regulators placed Independent American in
receivership. The defunct thrift, which had $793.7 million in
assets, was later merged into Sunbelt Savings Association of
Dallas.
