   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Genetics Institute Inc. said it agreed
to form a joint venture with Japan's Yamanouchi
Pharmaceutical Co. to develop Genetics Institute's
bone-growth promoters and other drugs.
   The pact represents a potentially broad alliance between
the companies that will give Genetics Institute a new source
of funds and a channel to the Japanese pharmaceutical market
for a number of its products that are in early stages of
development. Genetics Institute will share with Yamanouchi
some of the potential profits from the drugs but will retain
North American marketing rights to them.

   "Development of the bone-growth factors is expected to
cost as much as $100 million, most of which will be funded by
the partnership" over the next several years, said Garen
Bohlin, Genetics Institute's executive vice president. He
declined to say precisely how much of the funding would be
provided by each company. The drugs, which aren't expected to
reach the U.S. market before the mid-1990s, are being
developed to treat orthopedic, dental and other bone
disorders.
   The 50-50 joint venture will own rights to the drugs,
Genetics Institute said. The companies will share the
venture's proceeds from their sales of the drugs or from
sales by third parties that license rights to the drugs from
the venture. Genetics Institute, however, will retain not
only North American marketing rights but also world-wide
manufacturing rights to the drugs.
   The joint venture also will have the right of first
refusal to develop and commercialize other drugs in Japan
that are now being researched at Genetics Institute, Mr.
Bohlin said. He declined to identify the drugs involved, but
added that they "could span any of the areas we're working
in, but aren't quite as broad as everything in our pipeline."
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genetics
Institute closed at $38, up $1.875.
