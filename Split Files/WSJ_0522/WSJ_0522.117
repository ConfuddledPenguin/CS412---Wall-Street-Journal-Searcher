   NEW YORK -- News that West Germany's largest opposition
party is demanding changes in the recently signed state
treaty on German unification led to sharpened worry about the
costs of union and sent the dollar nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs
higher against the West German mark yesterday.
   The U.S. unit also rose against the yen and other
currencies on the market's perception that the Federal
Reserve won't act to reduce U.S. interest rates any time
soon, participants said.

   Rejection by the West German Social Democratic Party, or
SPD, of the current version of the Germanys' treaty on
monetary, economic and social union was seen by participants
as a complicating factor in the unification process that once
again focused market attention on the costs of union. The
treaty was signed last Friday.
   SPD leader Hans-Jochen Vogel's statement that the party
can't accept the current treaty because it doesn't go far
enough in creating good jobs for East Germans -- or provide
protection for East German businesses -- aroused worry that a
more expensive package might have to be negotiated, leading
to greater inflationary pressure on the West German economy.
   The SPD theoretically could block parliamentary passage of
the treaty through its newly won majority in the upper house
of the West German parliament. However, the SPD decision was
seen in West Germany as merely signaling possible delays in
the unification, currently set for July 2. And Mr. Vogel's
language appeared to leave open the possibility that the
treaty could be approved as is, with additions to be worked
out.
   While participants didn't expect the SPD move to derail
unification, the news brought out underlying nervousness in
the market about the exact impact of unification on the West
German economy.
   "The market's apprehensive on reunification because no one
seems to know the costs, and when there's some news out on
that front, there's a reaction," said Radhika Govindrajan, a
vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.
   The mark's weakness yesterday was exacerbated by
widespread rumors in Europe that West German central bank
President Karl Otto Poehl was resigning. The rumors later
were strenuously denied by the Bundesbank, but the excuse to
sell marks had been provided and the West German unit didn't
regain its losses, traders said.
   Helping the dollar to its gains against the mark was
growing market confidence, based on events last week, that
U.S. authorities won't pull interest rates lower soon.
Matched sales in the domestic money market last Thursday and
Friday, when the Federal Funds rate stood below the Fed's
target of 8 1/4%, and a statement Friday by Richmond, Va.,
Fed President Robert Black favoring higher interest rates
have convinced the market that the Fed isn't in a mood to
ease borrowing costs.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6626 marks, up from 1.6477 marks late Friday, and at
153.72 yen, up from 153 yen late Friday. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6875, down from $1.6900 late Friday.
   At midmorning Tuesday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency was
trading at 152.95 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of
153.25 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6665
marks.
   A rate cut by the Fed had been feared after recent U.S.
economic indicators suggested a slowing economy and subsiding
inflationary pressures.
   In that context, the dollar strengthened nearly
three-quarters of a yen against its Japanese counterpart,
helped by a belief that Japanese monetary authorities haven't
reacted effectively to signs of rising inflation, said Rick
Porter, a vice president and manager of corporate trading at
Westpac Corp. in New York.
   An appropriate response to rising inflationary pressures
would be an increase in the Japanese discount rate, a course
of action the Bank of Japan has so far balked at taking, Mr.
Porter said. The discount rate is the central bank's base
rate on loans to commercial banks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $373.30 an ounce, down $1.40. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $372.75 an ounce.
