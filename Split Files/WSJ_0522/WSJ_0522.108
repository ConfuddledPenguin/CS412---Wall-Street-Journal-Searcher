   NEW YORK -- The ABC and NBC networks announced their
prime-time schedules for next fall, and the lineups
underscored the recent, diverging fortunes of the two
broadcast rivals.
   ABC, on the rebound and riding on the success of the
oddball mystery "Twin Peaks," will introduce six new and
offbeat series to replace a slim four hours of its 22-hour
lineup. ABC also will pick up "Twin Peaks," the much-touted
trial series, as a full-fledged entry for next fall.

   But NBC, the No. 1 network for five years but recently on
a surprising downslide, will fiddle more: over a dozen
current series will be canceled, and nine new shows will
replace a total six hours of prime-time fare. The new series
on NBC, which like ABC also is aiming for shows that are
fresh and unique, include a comedy featuring the rap-music
star The Fresh Prince.
   The television industry had been especially interested in
the fate of "Twin Peaks," the most talked-about new
television show of the year, because it is a barometer of
ABC's turnaround efforts and of ABC's willingness to try
daring and "different" programs.
   In picking up 13 new episodes of "Twin Peaks," which airs
its seventh and final trial episode this Wednesday, ABC will
move the series from its usual time slot on Thursdays to 10
p.m. EST on Saturdays, the lowest-viewing night of the week.
   "At first, I thought these {ABC} people must be nuts. It's
a risky move," said Betsy Frank, senior vice president at ad
agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising. But it makes sense, she
said: "Twin Peaks," from film director David Lynch, is a cult
hit among young viewers, who may give up videocassette
rentals to watch it on Saturdays.
   ABC's four hours of new shows include four half-hour
comedies. Airing at 8:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, just before the
No. 1 hit "Roseanne," will be "Baby Talk," based on the hit
movie "Look Who's Talking." "Going Places," about four young
TV-show writers, comes from producers Tom Miller and Bob
Boyett and will air at 9:30 on Fridays, filling out a
two-hour block of Miller-Boyett shows.
   The other two new comedies are "America's Funniest . . .
Part II," which will follow the new ABC hit, "America's
Funniest Home Videos," at 8:30 p.m. on Sunday nights; and
"Married People," about three generations of wedded couples
in a New York brownstone.
   The two new one-hour dramas on ABC, a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., include "Cop Rock," an unusual
cops-and-robbers musical from producer Steven Bochco. The
show will air at 10 p.m. on Wednesdays, along with the
returning Bochco show "Doogie Howser, M.D." The other
one-hour series, "Gabriel's Fire," considered the hottest
pilot in a crop of 30 at ABC, stars James Earl Jones as an
ex-convict turned investigator. That new series will take up
the slot recently inhabited by "Twin Peaks" -- Thursdays at
9.
   At NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., new shows will be
aimed at the weakest spots. They include Mondays from 8 to 9
p.m., when NBC will try the rapper "Fresh Prince of Bel Air"
and a spinoff of the movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"; and
Saturdays 8 to 9 p.m., when NBC will broadcast "Parenthood,"
from the people who produced the film of the same name, and
"Working It Out," about a couple of divorcees. NBC also will
replace the 7-to-9 p.m. Sunday block with "Hull St. High" and
"Signs of Life," a medical drama.
   To make room for the new shows, NBC canceled a plethora of
programs. They include comedies "A.L.F.," "My Two Dads,"
"227," and "The Hogan Family" (which has been picked up by
CBS Inc.); and dramas "Hardball," "Mancuso, FBI," and
"Baywatch," which was made by former NBC Chairman Grant
Tinker's production company.
   The No. 1 network also killed six midseason replacements,
including "Working Girl" and "A Family for Joe," starring
Robert Mitchum, but kept three: "Grand," "Wings" and "Carol &amp;
Company."
   ABC fared a bit better with midseason entries, keeping
five and yanking six. The keepers: "Twin Peaks," the two
video shows, "Coach" and "Father Dowling Mysteries." The
casualties: "The Marshall Chronicles," "Elvis," "Brewster
Place," "Capital News," "H.E.L.P." and "Sunset Beat."
   In setting the fall lineup, ABC Entertainment President
Robert Iger targeted lagging time slots, rather than impose a
wholesale revamping. ABC, which finished No. 2 in prime-time
ratings this past TV season, was the only one of the three
major networks to post marked improvement.
   CBS will announce its lineup later this month.
   ABC hopes to fix Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. with the
follow-on video show; the entire Saturday night lineup, by
airing "Young Riders," "China Beach" and "Twin Peaks" and
canceling the two-hour mystery series that had "Columbo" and
"Kojak" revolving with two other series; and Wednesdays after
9 p.m., with "Married People" and "Cop Rock."
   To make room for all the new shows, ABC canceled a number
of programs. Among the new casualties: "Anything But Love,"
with Jamie Lee Curtis; the two-hour mystery wheel; "Mission:
Impossible"; and the Friday night comedy "Just the Ten of
Us."
   Two other current ABC series won't be on the fall lineup
but are expected to return later: "Head of the Class" and the
midseason program, "Equal Justice." ABC slated seven new
programs for midseason replacements that underscore its reach
for unusual fare. They include "The Company," about the CIA
and a husband-wife team of spies, and "My Life and Times,"
which has an 85-year-old man in the year 2035 reflecting on
the present.
