   A group led by Baron Edmond de Rothschild's Paris holding
company is about to acquire a 60% stake in the Carven fashion
and perfume house, people familiar with the pending
transaction said.
   Carven is known for its Vetiver and Ma Griffe fragrances,
as well as scarves, ties and air hostess uniforms. The price
wasn't immediately available.

   If completed, the acquisition would mark the baron's third
fashion investment during the past six months. Last year, his
Cie. Financiere Edmond de Rothschild acquired a 40% stake in
once-famous fashion house Jacques Fath. This year, the
holding company acquired 34% of Maud Frizon shoes.
   Carven's ties, watches, perfumes and scarves bring in
about 200 million francs ($36 million) in annual sales, half
from license fees. Unlike some aging houses, Carven still is
profitable, but the new owners hope to expand business
sharply. Carven's sales already are strong in Japan and South
Korea.
