   EAST GERMANS SLASH PRICES

   East German shops slashed prices on everything from
televisions to sportswear yesterday in a move to compete with
a flood of Western products.
   The government announced the price cuts just six weeks
before East Germany is to implement a free market and merge
its economy with West Germany. In East Berlin, lines of
consumers formed outside clothing, furniture and electronic
stores as new prices went into effect.
   The East German Commerce and Tourism Ministry said the
cuts would average about 60% on a variety of consumer goods,
according to the government news agency ADN. Television
prices dropped from about $1,818 to about $780.
   "Reductions, reductions, super bargains]" read shop window
slogans in a striking show of salesmanship for the former
communist country.
                                                                                                       

   GREECE CLEANS HOUSE
                                                                                                       

   The Greek government said some 100,000 part-time state
employees would be fired this month, casualties of the new
administration's drive to cut public spending. Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis said any minister or administrator who
abused the part-time-contract system would be dismissed.
Handing out part-time state jobs has long been used as a way
of rewarding political supporters. "It is necessary to end
this disgrace in which the state hires someone for five days
and he stays for five years," the prime minister said.
                                                                                                       

   ENDING EC'S DOUBLE TAXATION
                                                                                                       

   The European Community's commissioner for tax affairs
reaffirmed the goal of eliminating by the end of 1992 the
double taxes some European companies pay. Commissioner
Christiane Scrivener said companies wishing to trade with
other member states shouldn't be penalized at the expense of
companies working just within their own countries. From Jan.
1, 1993, Mrs. Scrivener said, all customs and fiscal controls
at EC borders would start to disappear.
                                                                                                       

   JOINT VENTURE FOR JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Orient Corp., a Japanese consumer-finance company, and
Combined Insurance Co. of America are planning a joint
venture in Japan, Orient said. The two companies will offer
insurance products that currently aren't available in Japan
such as hospitalization insurance. Orient will use its
nationwide network of consumer-loan outlets to sell the
products, a spokesman said. Chicago-based Combined is the
largest unit in terms of sales of Aon Corp., a holding
company of five U.S. insurance firms. The new venture is to
be half-owned by each parent.
                                                                                                       

   CRIME IN MOSCOW
                                                                                                       

   Moscow's police are finding it more difficult to control
citizens since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began his
reforms and have seen crime rise by 40% in the past year, a
police official said. "The whole climate has become more
tolerant . . . and that has led to more crime and
disturbances of the peace," said Nikolai Myrikov, Moscow's
deputy head of police, during a visit to the Netherlands to
learn about the workings of Dutch police. Mr. Myrikov said
the overall crime rate in Moscow rose by 40% in the past
year.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIA AND ALCOHOL ADS
                                                                                                       

   Australian Sen. Janet Powell, a member of the minority
Democrat Party, plans to introduce legislation in parliament
to effect a ban on alcohol advertising. She said the
Australian Medical Association was pushing for such a ban and
said people were worried by alcohol-driven domestic violence
and teen-age drinking. "I reject the notion that to properly
identify as an Australian you have to be a beer-guzzling
male," she said. The senator's proposal was denounced
yesterday by the chief of Carlton &amp; United Breweries. Pat
Stone said the move was "a desperate ploy to gain attention
at a time . . . of economic chaos."
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA'S EXPORT PROBLEM
                                                                                                       

   South Korea suffers from a rising rate of defects in its
export products.
   The Ministry of Trade and Industry reported that, of the
275 export items subject to government examination for
quality, 5.3% were found to be defective during the first
quarter of this year. The figure contrasts sharply with a 3%
rate in 1988 and a 4.2% rate in 1989.
   A ministry official attributed the rising defect rate to
poor workmanship, deriving from deteriorating worker morale.
Growing labor disputes in recent years have lowered labor
productivity and damaged the quality of products, he said.
   The government is now uncertain about reducing the number
of export items for examination, as had been planned. The
worry is that such a reduction would further damage the
quality of export products, the official added.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Sir Hardy Amies, said to be Queen Elizabeth II's favorite
couturier, told a British magazine that his royal client
"grumbles about our prices, drops hints and things, but she
has been told . . . that those are the prices." He also said
the queen often ignores his clothing advice. "She listens . .
. then goes off and wears shabby shoes because they're
comfortable." . . . The Soviet legislature granted President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev a big pay raise, according to the news
agency Tass. The agency said the legislature set Mr.
Gorbachev's monthly pay at 4,000 rubles -- $6,480 at the
official exchange rate -- more than twice what he is now
reported to be earning.
