   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Citizens Utilities Co. said it signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Louisiana General Services
Inc., a Harvey, La., natural-gas utility, in a deal valued at
approximately $125 million.
   Under the terms of the agreement, each of Louisiana
General's approximately 5.3 million shares outstanding will
be converted into 0.6719 of a share of Citizens Series B
stock, which closed in national over-the-counter trading at
$34 each, down $2. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, Louisiana General shares closed at $20.25, up $3.125
each.

   Citizens is a utilities concern dominated by the
telecommunications properties -- mostly cellular and paging
companies -- it acquired in recent years. The acquistion of
Louisiana General will restore its profile in the gas
business, said Ishier Jacobson, Citizens chief executive
officer. Citizens owns gas operations in Colorado and
Arizona.
   "We were once much bigger in gas," proportionate to other
Citizens businesses, said Mr. Jacobson. "We'd like to
increase that share again. And of course, we're maintaining
our diversification."
   Mr. Jacobson said the merger wasn't sought by Louisiana
General, but emerged through social discussions between a
Citizen board member and a Louisiana General board member.
James W. Swenson, Louisiana General's chairman, president and
chief executive, said he was "absolutley happy" with the
arrangement.
   Louisiana General reported income of $9.7 million on
revenue of $152.9 million for the year ended March 31, 1990.
For 1989, Citizens posted profit of $88.7 million on revenue
of $338.7 million.
   Analysts said the deal makes sense, though it bucks
Citizens' recent acquisition pattern. "I see Citizens as the
equivalent of a mutual fund of regulated utilities," said
Bert Kramer of PaineWebber Group Inc. "From that point of
view, gas makes as much sense as anything else."
