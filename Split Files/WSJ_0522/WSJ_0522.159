   DALLAS -- Rosewood Financial Inc., whose previous efforts
to take over troubled First Executive Corp. failed, said it
had proposed that First Executive expand its board by one
seat and appoint Donald F. Craib Jr., former chairman and
chief executive officer of Allstate Insurance Group, to the
position.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the unit
of Rosewood Corp., which is owned by the trust estate of oil
heiress Carolyn Rose Hunt, said Mr. Craib says he thinks he
can make a substantial contribution to the struggling Los
Angeles insurer whose huge junk-bond portfolio led to a
$775.6 million net loss in 1989. The company has six
directors.

   Previously, Mr. Craib was recruited by Rosewood as a
candidate to succeed First Executive Chairman Fred Carr,
whose ouster was a condition of the aborted takeover bid.
Rosewood has seen a $100 million investment in First
Executive common stock reduced to roughly $20 million in
value as a result of the company's troubles. Mrs. Hunt's
trust was hit with additional bad news last week when its
troubled thrift, Southwest Savings Association, was placed
under U.S. conservatorship.
   A Rosewood spokesman refused to say whether the company
continues to seek Mr. Carr's ouster or whether it planned to
renew its previous takeover bid, which was turned down by
First Executive's board.
   Other First Executive holders were skeptical about whether
Rosewood planned to make another offer. "I think Rosewood and
the {Hunt} family have suffered so extensively that I just
can't imagine the family saying, `We want to throw more good
money after bad,'" said investor Travis Reed, who said he
owns a 2% stake in First Executive.
   First Executive officals couldn't be reached for comment.
