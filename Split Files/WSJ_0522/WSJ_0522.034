   Stanley S. Arkin, the brash trial lawyer who made his name
as a defense attorney in insider-trading cases, is abandoning
his small practice to join the New York law firm of
Chadbourne &amp; Parke.
   Mr. Arkin's decision to join the 251-lawyer firm after
being on his own for 21 years reflects the growing pressures
on small firm practitioners, particularly in the
criminal-defense arena where Mr. Arkin has become as
well-known as many of his clients. It also reflects large
firms' increased interest in handling such work.

   "Ten years ago the large so-called silk-stocking firms
wouldn't dirty their fingers on criminal cases," says Plato
Cacheris, a criminal-defense lawyer with the six-lawyer
Washington, D.C., firm of Cacheris &amp; Towey. "Now the large
firms have decided it's remunerative to retain those cases."
   In part, that change in attitude stems from the
government's increased emphasis on prosecuting
securities-related crimes, as well as other white-collar
cases. Conservative law firms can still spurn the "dirtier"
drug or organized-crime cases while cashing in on
white-collar criminal-defense work.
   Chadbourne &amp; Parke had been looking for a litigator with a
white-collar defense background since it discovered two years
ago that the firm "had to turn down matters because we didn't
have that kind of expertise," says Jerome C. Katz, a partner
with the firm.
   Mr. Arkin, 52 years old, came to prominence in the field
in the late 1970s when he represented a financial printer
named Vincent Chiarella, who was accused of trading on
information he garnered while assembling tender-offer
documents. Mr. Arkin took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court,
where the conviction was reversed. In a ruling that has made
it more difficult for the government to pursue such cases,
the court limited the definition of who can be guilty of
insider trading.
   Since then, Mr. Arkin has represented a wide range of
clients, including Richard Wigton, the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
executive who faced insider-trading charges that were later
dropped by federal prosecutors, and D. Ronald Yagoda, the
head trader at Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. who was acquitted of
insider trading as part of the so-called "Yuppie Five" case.
Currently, he is representing entertainer Johnny Carson and
Simon &amp; Schuster chief executive officer Richard Snyder in
their respective matrimonial cases.
   Despite Mr. Arkin's strong reputation, some defense
lawyers have said he and the Chadbourne firm make an odd
match. Chadbourne is considered somewhat stodgy, preferring
to do its work quietly and stay out of the public eye. Mr.
Arkin, in contrast, is widely available to reporters and has
generated controversy for the aggressive public stands he has
taken on behalf of his clients.
   Mr. Katz says that the firm doesn't expect Mr. Arkin to
abandon his somewhat unorthodox style. "We don't want him to
tone down. We want to let Stanley Arkin be Stanley Arkin. We
do not intend for him to change his style or his personality
to suit us," Mr. Katz says.
   At Chadbourne, Mr. Arkin will specialize in criminal and
regulatory investigations and prosecutions, as well as
complex civil and matrimonial matters and corporate internal
investigations. Mr. Arkin, along with his two partners and
two associates, will join the Chadbourne firm effective July
1.
   Mr. Arkin says that as his cases have grown more
complicated so has the need for the kind of resources and
back up that a large firm offers. "You cannot handle a huge
litigation in a small firm and service other clients," he
says. "A trial kills your practice, it takes so much time."
   Mr. Arkin says that being at a large firm will also ease
the pressures of having to generate and service his clients
while serving as the office manager as well. He won't be
suffering financially. People familiar with the situation say
Mr. Arkin will earn at least $1 million in his first year at
the firm. Mr. Arkin says he received no financial guarantees
and that his income will reflect the profits of the entire
firm. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, Chadbourne had gross
revenue of $95 million and profit per partner of $505,000,
according to people familiar with the firm's revenue.
   Some defense lawyers working at small firms say they
prefer the collegiality and independence of their practices.
"My experience at a large firm wasn't unpleasant but I prefer
the unstructured existence of a small firm," says Mr.
Cacheris. "You get less involved in administrative matters
and firm meetings, which I find boring."
   Mr. Arkin, who admits to some anxiety about the move, says
he weighed the benefits and drawbacks of joining a large firm
and decided that he wanted to develop himself "as an adviser
as opposed to a guerilla-warfare team leader."

   NORIEGA'S LAWYERS are likely to have their fees paid by
the U.S.
   At a hearing in Miami before U.S. District Judge William
M. Hoeveler, federal prosecutors said the government agreed
to pay the fees, adding that U.S. officials want to see
deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega receive a fair
trial.
   In late April, Mr. Noriega's defense team, led by Frank
Rubino, asked the court to be allowed to withdraw from the
drug-racketeering case. They complained that the U.S. had
stopped the flow of their fees by freezing Mr. Noriega's
assets.
   The tentative agreement stems from Mr. Noriega's decision
to sign an affidavit stating he will reimburse the government
for his lawyers' fees if and when his assets are unfrozen.
Moreover, a provision in the Criminal Justice Act concerning
"complex" cases involving court-appointed lawyers will allow
Judge Hoeveler to award higher-than-normal fees.
   Judge Hoeveler set a Thursday hearing to rule on the
agreement and to determine what a reasonable fee might be for
Mr. Noriega's defense team.

   NEWS REPORTER must give testimony in criminal trial,
Florida court rules.
   The Florida Supreme Court ruled that a newspaper reporter
can be compelled to provide a pretrial interview, known as a
deposition, in a criminal trial about events witnessed while
working on a story.
   The decision, handed down unanimously last week, creates a
narrow exception to Florida court rulings that protected
reporters in many circumstances from divulging the source of
their information or the content of unpublished work.
   In this case, Miami Herald reporter Joel Achenbach
witnessed a drug search in 1986 while working on a story
about Miami International Airport. Police, using a drug
profile, singled out a suspect on a public concourse,
searched his luggage and found four kilograms of cocaine. The
subsequent account in the Herald's Tropic Sunday Magazine
differed slightly from what police said about whether the
suspect, a Cuban, was fluent enough in English to consent to
the search.
   When the Dade County public defender's office subpoenaed
Mr. Achenbach for a deposition, lawyers for the Herald, a
unit of Knight-Ridder Inc., argued that reporters have an
"across-the-board" qualified privilege against compelled
disclosure. The privilege can only be overcome, the paper
argued, if it can be proved that the information is relevant,
that it can be obtained no other way and that there is a
compelling interest in its disclosure.
   But five Florida Supreme Court justices ruled that no
First Amendment privilege exists when reporters are asked to
testify only about "eyewitness observations."
   "Ordinary citizens would not be excused from testifying as
to what they observe, and the First Amendment should not be
interpreted to make journalists' testimony privileged simply
because they made their observations while on duty as a
reporter," five of six justices ruled. A sixth justice
concurred with the result but argued that First Amendment
considerations should be weighed against society's interest
in compelling disclosure on a case-by-case basis.
   The decision is in line with similar rulings in Maryland,
New York and Texas. Herald lawyers complained that it forces
reporters to become participants in events rather than
independent observers.
   "I just think it puts the press in the wrong role," said
Sanford L. Bohrer, a Herald First Amendment lawyer.

   RASTAFARIAN PRISONERS can't be required to cut their hair,
court says.
   A federal appeals court in New York affirmed a lower court
decision that prevents state correctional authorities from
requiring haircuts of prisoners who adhere to Rastafarianism,
a religion that forbids followers to cut or comb their hair.
But the court refused to require the state to provide a
special diet for the Rastafarians, to permit them to wear
their religious headgear or to allow them to congregate for
prayer in the absence of clergy from outside the prison.
   The prisoners, represented by Prisoners' Legal Services of
New York, argued that prohibiting informal group prayer and
requiring new Rastafarian inmates to have their hair cut for
photographs violated their First Amendment right to free
exercise of religion. Ruling in favor of the prisoners on the
haircut issue but not on group prayer, the court said it
balanced the prisoners' constitutional rights against the
security needs and administrative requirements of the prison.
   The Rastafarians also contended that because New York
state makes allowances to Muslim and Jewish prisoners for
religious headgear and special diets, the state violated
their rights to equal protection under the Constitution. But
the court said the Rastafarians hadn't adequately defined
their dietary needs and that Jewish yarmulkes and Muslim
kufis were smaller than the Rastafarian religious hats --
called tams -- and posed less of a security threat.
   Robert Selcov, a lawyer for the prisoners, criticized the
decision for relying on "extremely fine differences" between
individual religions and particular religious practices. But
he said that by not requiring haircuts of the Rastafarians,
the opinion "shows that the federal courts are not totally
turning their backs on prison inmates' constitutional
rights."
   The New York attorney general's office hasn't yet decided
whether it will seek U.S. Supreme Court review on the haircut
issue.
