   WASHINGTON -- In a move intended to prevent layoffs at
Raytheon Co.'s missile-making operations, the Army awarded
the firm a $414 million contract to supply certain
ground-control equipment to Italy.
   The unusual contract calls for the U.S to buy support
equipment for 20 planned Patriot ground-to-air missile
systems in Italy -- even though the Italian government hasn't
yet appropriated funds for the missiles the equipment is
meant to be used with. The ground equipment is manufactured
at the same Raytheon facilities in Andover, Mass., where the
company builds Patriot missiles.

   Since the Army has proposed phasing out purchases of the
missiles during the next few years, Raytheon has pushed hard
to win U.S. approval of the contract involving Italy. Without
the Army contract, Raytheon has said it would be forced to
lay off hundreds of workers.
   In response to questions, a spokesman for the Army's
missile command said that one of the major reasons for
signing the contract was to prevent disruptions or layoffs at
Raytheon's missile-making operations. Senior Army acquisition
officials previously used similar arguments to defend the
Italian contract, and the company itself has used such
arguments to garner congressional support to pay for the
ground-control equipment.
   The Pentagon's decision capped another successful lobbying
effort by Raytheon, one of the few major defense contractors
that has avoided layoffs from defense belt-tightening. The
company had said that approximately 1,200 of the 6,000
workers at its Andover plant could have received pink slips
during the next few years unless the Italian project was
funded. Some Andover production lines building Patriot
equipment for U.S. air defense needs would have stopped
working in 1991.
   "This helps stabilize our production capabilities as we
look forward to future international sales," said a Raytheon
spokesman.
   Raytheon plans to license production of the missiles in
Italy by an Italian consortium. Without the Army's approval
of funding for the ground equipment, however, the roughly $5
billion project in Italy would have collapsed.
   The U.S. and Italy signed a memorandum of understanding
about the Patriot systems two years ago, but Italy still
hasn't provided final funding for any of the planned missile
purchases.
   The Army said 1984 was the last time it approved such a
contract to supply ground-control equipment for U.S.-made
missiles to a foreign country. That contract involved the
West German military.
   A person familiar with the Patriot negotiations said part
of the Pentagon's decision to pay for the ground equipment
was based on fears that Raytheon would raise prices for the
equipment for Italy purchased by the U.S if Andover
production lines had to be closed down and later reopened.
   Late last month, the Pentagon rescinded an earlier
decision to cut procurement of Hawk missiles, also made at
Andover, saving another 850 Raytheon jobs.
   In other contract actions, Rockwell International Corp.
received a $10.8 million Air Force contract for B-1B
electronic test equipment.
