   Great American sold two million shares to Chiquita in
early April. As a result of the two transactions, Great
American said it received about $135 million and will post a
$45 million pretax gain. In the year-ago second quarter,
Great American had a loss of $23.6 million, including profit
from discontinued operations of $2.2 million, on revenue of
$83.9 million.
   The owner and operator of radio and television stations
said proceeds of the sale will be used for the repayment of
bank debt and working capital.
   Both Great American and Chiquita are units of American
Financial Corp., a closely held financial-services concern.
   Chiquita announced the public offering of 6,183,468 shares
of common stock at $20.125 each, of which 3,710,081 shares
are being offered in the U.S. and 2,473,387 abroad. Of the
total, one million shares are being offered by Chiquita and
the remainder by Great American.
