   Novell Inc. confirmed today that big stockholders derailed
its proposed merger with Lotus Development Corp.
   Stock in Novell, based in Provo, Utah, rose sharply to
$42, up $1.875, in heavy national over-the-counter trading.
Shares in Lotus Development, based in Cambridge, Mass., fell
$1 apiece to $33.75, also in heavy over-the-counter trading.

   Raymond Noorda, Novell's chairman, said he believed the
two companies, which both make software for personal
computers, would have made a good match, but that the deal
fell through when Lotus rejected a plea to give Novell equal
representation on the board of the combined company.
   Though Mr. Noorda stressed that he believes the software
industry is entering a period of consolidation, he said he
wasn't shopping the company around. "We're not looking for
merger partners at this time," he said.
   Mr. Noorda also said that despite the collapse of the deal
with Lotus, he expects the two companies to cooperate on a
range of business activities. "Some positive things will
happen between the two companies," he said.
