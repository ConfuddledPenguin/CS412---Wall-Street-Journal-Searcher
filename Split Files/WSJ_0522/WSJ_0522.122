   CINCINNATI -- Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it expects fiscal
1990 results to be strong, with gains in the laundry, shampoo
and diaper categories.
   Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and chief executive officer, said
he expects that detergents will show a 15% gain in volume
sold, while shampoos and diapers will climb 12% and 10%
respectively. He wouldn't comment specifically about
earnings.

   In the fiscal year ended June 30, P&amp;G had net income of
$1.21 billion, or $7.12 a share, on sales of $21.4 billion.
   Speaking to financial analysts, Mr. Artzt said P&amp;G's
troubled food and beverage division should "substantially
improve." Specifically, he pointed out that P&amp;G has plans to
improve Crisco shortening and oil and Duncan Hines baking
mixes within a year.
   Citrus Hill orange juice remains a problem, he said,
noting that part of the trouble has been costs and marketing
missteps. "We've lost a bundle there and we don't have it
fixed yet," Mr. Artzt said. He likened the eventual
turnaround to P&amp;G's success in Japan: "We fixed that one and
we can fix this one," he said.
   The greatest uncertainty in the food division is P&amp;G's fat
substitute, olestra, which hasn't received Food and Drug
Administration approval. Mr. Artzt said P&amp;G narrowed the
scope of its petition to speed clearance. He declined to be
specific but officials noted the narrowing involves
concentrating on a couple products that would eventually
contain the substitute.
   Unlike Monsanto Co.'s Simplesse, which is made from egg
proteins, olestra is a more complicated blend that can be
used in hot and cold foods. Mr. Artzt said it will take "a
couple years" after the FDA approves the substitute until P&amp;G
factories can "start pumping it out." Simplesse recently won
FDA approval.
   "Simplesse is easy to do if you've got enough eggs," he
said.
   International expansion continues to be a priority. The
company is in discussions with joint-venture partners in
Eastern Europe and is trying to establish a Moscow office.
"We won't go rushing in," Mr. Artzt said. Two concerns he has
are finding sources of currency and the lack of an adequate
distribution system.
   In manufacturing, the executive predicted increased
capital spending to expand plant capacity around the world.
   In advertising, Mr. Artzt plans to focus more on
advertisments than promotions in the future because the
balance of spending has "gotten a little out of whack."
   One new ad campaign he showed analysts was for Hawaiian
Punch, which P&amp;G recently acquired. The campaign reintroduces
the familiar "Punchy" character.
   Analysts were generally upbeat about Mr. Artzt's remarks.
But they lamented the lack of detail in his forecasts. "P&amp;G
is philosophically bullish and financially vague," said
analyst Hugh Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers. "But there's an
internal confidence that wasn't there before."
