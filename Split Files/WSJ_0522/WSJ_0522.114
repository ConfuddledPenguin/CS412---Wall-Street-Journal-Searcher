   Birmingham Steel Corp. said it was suspending indefinitely
its Norfolk steel melting operations, resulting in a
one-time, fourth-quarter charge of about $6.9 million, or 57
cents a share.
   The Birmingham, Ala., operator of mini-mills attributed
the shutdown to continued losses as well as high maintenance
and electric power costs. Birmingham said it would continue
to operate its Norfolk rolling mill by processing
semifinished steel billets supplied from other Birmingham
locations. The company said it didn't anticipate any
"material change" in steel shipments or any disruptions in
deliveries as a result of the suspension.
