   French food group BSN S.A. announced that it has put its
U.S. cookie units up for sale as part of its strategy of
focusing on high-growth markets in eastern Europe and Asia.
   The company said its Mother's and Salerno subsidiaries,
with combined annual revenue of about $200 million, claim
only 5.7% of the U.S. cookie market, and further expansion in
the largely saturated sector would have been too costly.

   BSN said "new perspectives are opening in the countries of
Eastern Europe and in regions of strong demographic growth
such as India and Asia . . . In order to take advantage of
this rapid expansion, BSN has decided to sell its U.S.
business."
   The French food group retains U.S. units in other product
categories, including yogurt maker Dannon Co. and Lea &amp;
Perrins, a producer of condiments.
