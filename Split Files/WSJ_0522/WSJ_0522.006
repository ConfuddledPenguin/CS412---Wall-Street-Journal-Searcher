   STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION (Washington) -- Timothy
G. Greene was named executive vice president and general
counsel of this operator of a secondary market in educational
loans. Mr. Greene, 51 years old, a Dallas lawyer who was
Sallie Mae's first general counsel, will succeed Ronald F.
Hunt, 47, who will begin a law practice in North Carolina in
midsummer. Among the challenges Mr. Greene will face is a
legal battle with commercial banks over Sallie Mae's right to
originate student loans.
