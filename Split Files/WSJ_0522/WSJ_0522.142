   BTR PLC, one of Britain's biggest industrial
conglomerates, said its Schlegal Corp. subsidiary will buy
Global Automotive Sealing Systems Group from United
Technologies Corp. for $200 million.
   The purchase follows BTR's defeat last month in its quest
for Norton Co., a Worcester, Mass.-based chemicals and
abrasives maker that decided to be acquired by French
glassmaker Cie. de Saint-Gobain S.A. in a friendly
transaction.

   In Hartford, Conn., United Technologies said proceeds of
the sale will be used to reduce debt. The automotive sealing
systems business develops, manufactures and markets auto body
sealing products. It employs 4,100 people world-wide and had
sales of about $275 million in 1989.
