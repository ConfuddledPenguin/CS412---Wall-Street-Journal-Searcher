   NEW YORK -- Harper Collins, a book-publishing affiliate of
News Corp., agreed to sell health-care publisher J.B.
Lippincott Co. to an Amsterdam publisher for more than $250
million.
   Harper Collins put the unit up for sale in mid-April,
seeking to cut debt and focus itself more sharply on book
publishing. Analysts had estimated that Philadelphia-based
Lippincott, which publishes newsletters, journals and books
on medical topics, might fetch $200 million to as much as
$250 million.

   Six bidders vied for Lippincott; the winner was a New York
subsidiary of Wolters Kluwer N.V., which currently owns
medical publishers Raven Press and Aspen Publishers.
   Harper declined to disclose the other bidders. But people
in the industry said that Paramount Communications Inc., the
entertainment company here; Toronto publisher Thomson Corp.;
Britain's Reed International PLC and Pearson PLC; and
Elsevier N.V. of the Netherlands all bid for Lippincott.
   Of the transaction's terms, a spokesman for Harper did say
that "we think it's a good price" at 19 times to 20 times
annual earnings. Revenue at Lippincott approaches $100
million, industry analysts estimate.
   Harper Collins publishes books on general subjects; it
also produces texts for high schools and colleges and,
through its Zondervan unit, books on religious topics.
   Lippincott, founded in 1792, publishes materials for
medicine, dentistry, nursing and other health-care fields.
The company's Drug Facts &amp; Comparisons provides U.S.
pharmacists with data about drugs.
   News Corp., the media giant controlled by the investor
Rupert Murdoch, has been building a publishing group over the
past few years. It acquired Harper &amp; Row for $293 million in
April 1987, Zondervan in August 1988, the 60% it didn't own
of British Publisher William Collins in January 1989, and
Scott Foresman for $407 million last November.
   Wolters Kluwer has nearly 100 companies in its fold,
employing more than 8,000 in Europe and the U.S. The company
earned $75 million on $1 billion of sales in 1989.
   The companies signed a definitive agreement; they expect
to close the transaction, subject to clearance by regulators,
by June 29.
