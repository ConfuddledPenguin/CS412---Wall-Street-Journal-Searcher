   Soybean and corn futures prices fell yesterday on
forecasts of warmer, drier weather across many midwestern
growing regions this week and concerns about weak export
demand from the Soviet Union.
   Futures prices rallied last week on fears that rain-soaked
fields were delaying planting to such an extent that crop
yields could be reduced in many areas. But government and
private weather forecasts released late Friday made it clear
that farmers in most midwestern states would benefit from
fair weather this week and most of next.

   "Overall, it's going to be drier and warmer, with highs in
the 70s and 80s across much of the heartland" through next
week, said Charles Notis, a principal in Freese-Notis Weather
Inc., in Des Moines, Iowa.
   The concern about the heavy rains of recent weeks tended
to obscure the importance of replenishing subsoil moisture in
many growing regions, analysts said. New grain hybrids also
allow farmers to get crops in the field much later than in
decades past and still reap average to above-average yields
at harvest time. Analysts noted that during 1978 and 1981,
wet spring weather hampered planting in many areas, but
hardly made a dent in yields.
   The stock market rally also has been sucking speculative
money out of the grain trading pits in recent days that might
have helped support futures prices, said Steven Freed, a
futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean futures for July delivery fell 10.25 cents to
close at $6.1050 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. July
corn futures dropped 5.25 cents to close at $2.77 a bushel.
   The outlook for an increase in export sales to the Soviet
Union in coming months is becoming dimmer. Pravda and other
Soviet newspapers carried reports over the weekend and
yesterday about a ministerial meeting at which speakers were
sharply critical of the country's heavy reliance on foreign
grain imports and the amount of scarce hard currency devoted
to grain imports over the past year, analysts said.
   The Soviet Union needs grain imports "like a drug addict
does his needle," said one speaker at the meeting, according
to wire service reports.
   The implication of this latest salvo aimed at the Soviet
Union's stumbling economic policy is that, with such internal
demand for hard currency, the Soviets aren't likely to be
spending nearly as much on grain imports in coming months.
   Some analysts are less concerned about future orders than
they are about the likelihood that current bills will be
paid. Western trade specialists estimate that the Soviets are
about $1 billion in arrears on payments to foreign grain
trading firms, including $250 million owed U.S. trading
firms. European Community companies are owed as much as $350
million, Japanese trading firms are owed $200 million and
Canadian companies are owed $200 million, analysts said.
   News on the diplomatic front also weighed on grain futures
prices. Secretary of State James Baker indicated after his
most recent trip to Moscow that the U.S. still hasn't decided
whether to grant most-favored-nation status to the Soviet
Union -- a step that would be expected to lead to new export
credits extended to the Soviets, analysts said.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is scheduled to visit
the U.S. beginning May 30 for a summit meeting with President
Bush, and many analysts had assumed that most-favored-nation
status would have been assured by this point.
   Another cloud over exports concerns China's trade status
with the U.S. Its most-favored-nation status expires early
next month. Sen. George Mitchell, (D., Maine), Senate
majority leader, said the tepid Bush administration response
to China's murderous quelling of student revolt a year ago is
a failure, and he called for an end to China's preferential
trade treatment.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum prices fell on little news except
continuing worries over an apparent oversupply of crude oil.
U.S. petroleum refiners reduced their field postings for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude, by 50 cents a barrel
to $17.50. In futures trading, prices of both gasoline and
crude oil crumbled. June and July contracts for unleaded
gasoline were down more than one cent a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The Merc contract for June delivery
crude declined 50 cents a barrel to $18.26. Some weakness in
that contract had been expected because it ceases trading
after today. But the July contract also fell, by 38 cents a
barrel to $19.04. Separate announcements by oil ministers of
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that they are
abiding by terms of the recent production agreement of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had negligible
impact on the market. Saudi Arabia is believed to be reducing
output to near the level of its quota of 5.4 million barrels
a day, but oil analysts said there isn't yet any evidence of
cutbacks by other OPEC overproducers. On the contrary, said
Nauman Barakat, a Shearson Lehman Hutton first vice
president, "OPEC output in May could show a slight increase
over April, and that would be very negative for the market."

   COPPER: Futures prices eased as the Peruvian labor
situation improved and supplies of the metal became more
ample. The soonest-to-expire May contract ended with a loss
of 1.70 cents a pound at $1.1990. The premium of May over
July narrowed by 0.30 cent a pound because July was off 1.40
cents to $1.1345. The premium of the London Metal Exchange's
cash position over its three-months delivery also narrowed
somewhat. Copper inventories in warehouses of New York's
Commodity Exchange rose by 1,174 tons to 8,455 tons. Analysts
expect the London Metal Exchange today to announce an
increase in copper inventories of 2,000 to 6,000 tons. In
Peru, workers at the Southern Peru Copper Corp.'s two mines
and a smelter postponed until June 5 a strike that was
scheduled to begin yesterday. A spokesman for Southern Peru
Copper in New York said the action was taken "in anticipation
of a voluntary raise {the company} will be making on June 4."
Separately, analysts said that most of the workers at
Centromin Corp., Peru's state-owned mining company, who went
out on strike a week ago, returned yesterday, although some
remained out.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices failed to hold an early advance and
ended lower despite further unrest in the Ivory Coast, the
world's leading cocoa grower. The July contract finished with
a loss of $31 a metric ton at $1,446 after trading as high as
$1,485. The initial strength was attributed to news reports
that the police in Abidjan, the nation's capital, had gone on
strike over working conditions and pay. However, military
police took over and the strike soon ended, reports said.
Later, it was reported that dock workers, who were also
unhappy over pay and working conditions, had postponed a
scheduled strike until June 5. One analyst observed that the
string of labor problems in the Ivory Coast lost their impact
because the government had quickly moved to end each dispute.
"The government met the demands of the army recruits last
week and now of the police. It is expected they'll do the
same with the dock workers, and prevent those problems from
getting worse," said the analyst. Also important, he added,
is that "for all the furor, the harvesting, transportation
and shipment of cocoa hasn't been affected yet."
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: The soonest-to-expire July contract rose its daily
limit of two cents a pound, to 78.13 cents, because supplies
of immediately available cotton are tight. Other deliveries
gained by smaller amounts, ranging to slightly over one cent
a pound. Fundamentally, the advance was triggered by reduced
supplies of desirable types of cotton for shipment during the
summer. Such cotton would meet industrial needs prior to the
arrival of cotton from the 1990-91 crop, which begins its
season on Aug. 1, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for
Prudential-Bache Securities, New York. Buying was widespread,
with demand coming from computer-guided funds, speculators,
and "local" traders, who deal for their own accounts, Mr.
Simon said. Buying interest accelerated as the July
contract's price advance rose above 76.80 cents and then 77
cents, he said.
