   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that state water
policies must take a back seat to federal regulation of
hydroelectric plants.
   The 9-0 decision was a setback for state attempts to set
minimum water-flow levels for rivers and streams affected by
federally licensed hydroelectric plants.

   In an opinion written by Associate Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, the high court declined a suggestion by California
that it reconsider a 44-year-old decision. That 1946 decision
said that in a clash between state and federal regulations
over water flow, state authority is limited to water for
irrigation or municipal use.
   The court ruled in a dispute over the minimum water flow
required for Rock Creek, a tributary of the American River
located near Placerville, Calif., between Sacramento and the
Sierra Nevada. In granting a license for a hydroelectric
plant on Rock Creek in 1983, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission established minimum levels for the flow of water
that must remain in the creek. But a California state agency
proposed higher minimum flow rates in 1987, causing the
operators of the power plant to appeal to the FERC; the
commission said its own order should be enforced.
   Last June, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled
that FERC's policies pre-empted state law. Yesterday, the
high court affirmed the appeals court ruling.
   In a friend-of-the-court brief supporting California, 43
other states warned that if the appeals court ruling were
allowed to stand, it would "fundamentally alter state control
of water resources and will eviscerate comprehensive state
regulatory systems for allocating water."(California vs.
FERC)
   For the second time since the court term began in October,
the justices didn't grant review of any new cases yesterday,
the latest sign that the justices have cut back significantly
on the number of cases they are deciding.
   Although the pattern has been apparent for months, the
reason for the reduction in the number of cases to be decided
remains a mystery. The court has offered no official
explanation, and individual justices say there is no
concerted effort to grant review to fewer cases.
   The justices have completed oral arguments for their
current term, which will end in June or July. Cases granted
one-hour hearings in recent weeks will be argued in the next
term that begins Oct. 1. The justices have allocated 44 hours
of argument in October and November, but so far they have
filled only 26 hours. In comparison, at this time a year ago
they had filled 47 hours for the next term. There are only a
few weeks remaining in which they can add to the October and
November calendar.
                                                                                                       

   State Liquor Regulations
                                                                                                       

   The high court upheld North Dakota's regulation of liquor
that is purchased by the Defense Department for sale at two
military bases in the state. In an opinion written by
Associate Justice John Paul Stevens III, the high court
rejected the federal government's challenge that the state
regulations interfere with federal operations.
   North Dakota requires monthly reports of liquor brought
into the state from other states. It also requires that
liquor distillers in other states attach special
identification labels on liquor they sell to military bases
in North Dakota.
   The federal government challenged the regulations after
numerous distillers either refused to ship to North Dakota
military bases or raised their prices. A federal appeals
court in St. Louis ruled that the regulations discriminated
against out-of-state distillers.
   Yesterday, the high court, splintered into three separate
opinions, upheld the monthly reporting requirement, 9-0. The
justices also upheld the labeling regulation, but the vote
was 5-4, with Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr.,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy
dissenting. (North Dakota vs. U.S.)
                                                                                                       

   Court in Brief
                                                                                                       

   In other action yesterday, the high court:
   -- Ruled, 9-0, that a husband and wife who are members of
the Mormon Church can't take a federal tax deduction for
funds they transferred to their sons who served as unpaid
Mormon missionaries. In an opinion written by Justice
O'Connor, the court said the funds weren't donated for the
church's use and can't be treated as charitable deductions.
(Davis vs. U.S.)
   -- Ruled, 9-0, that federal courts may order defendants to
make restitution only for crimes for which they were
convicted. In an opinion written by Justice Marshall, the
court rejected the Justice Department's argument that federal
law allows restitution orders for crimes with which a
defendant is charged, but not convicted. (Hughey vs. U.S.)
   -- Upheld, by a 9-0 vote, a 1984 federal law that requires
people convicted of federal misdemeanors to pay a $25 fine
for each count into a Crime Victims Fund that is used to
compensate victims of crimes. In an opinion written by
Justice Marshall, the court rejected an argument that the
1984 law is a means of raising federal revenue that, under
the Constitution, had to originate in the House of
Representatives, rather than in the Senate. (U.S. vs.
Munoz-Flores).
   -- Let stand a federal court order issued in January 1989
that permanently bars Operation Rescue from blocking access
to and from abortion clinics in New York. There are similar
court orders against the anti-abortion group in a number of
cities; Operation Rescue has appealed them all, but with
little success thus far. (Terry vs. New York State National
Organization for Women)
   -- Let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court in Denver
that an employer can't avoid liability for religious
discrimination in hiring by offering to accommodate an
applicant's beliefs after the applicant has complained to the
state discrimination agency. The appeals court reinstated a
lawsuit by an American Indian who used peyote in Native
American Church rituals. He was denied a truck driver's job
by Nobel-Sysco Foods Services Co., a Sysco Corp. unit.
