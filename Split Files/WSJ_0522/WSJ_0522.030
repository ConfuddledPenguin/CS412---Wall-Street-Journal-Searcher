   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
use of a type of live bacteria to treat bladder cancer.
   Manufactured by Connaught Laboratories Ltd., of
Willowdale, Ontario, the drug will be distributed in the U.S.
under the brand name Theracys.

   The bacteria, Bacillus Calmette Guerin Live, already are
manufactured by several U.S. companies -- including Quad
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Indianapolis, and Organon Inc. of
West Orange, N.J. -- for treating tuberculosis. But the drug
also has been found helpful in treating a type of cancer that
affects approximately 10,000 people.
   Under the treatment, the bacteria are inserted into the
bladder through a catheter, inflaming the bladder and causing
it to expel cancer cells.
   Connaught, a unit of France-based Pasteur Merieux Serums &amp;
Vaccins, is the first company to receive U.S. approval for
this use of the bacteria. Neither Connaught nor its parent is
publicly traded in the U.S.
   A spokesman for the company's U.S. distributor, Connaught
Laboratories Inc., of Swiftwater, Pa., said the drug would be
available in approximately three months.
