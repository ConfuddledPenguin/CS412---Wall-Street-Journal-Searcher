   AUSTIN, Texas -- HealthVest said it had a net loss of
$116.8 million, or $10.57 a share, for 1989 and said that its
auditor expressed substantial doubts about the real estate
trust's ability to continue as a going concern.
   HealthVest said its year-end loss included a $127.4
million write-down of assets, most of which were related to
troubles at Healthcare International Inc., a deeply troubled
hospital management that leases many of its properties. In
1988, HealthVest had net income of $24 million, or $2.06 a
share.

   Revenue for the year fell about 5% to $51.2 million from
$53.7 million.
   In its letter to HealthVest trustees and shareholders,
Price Waterhouse noted that HealthVest was spun off from
Healthcare International in 1986 and that HealthVest
purchased some real estate from Healthcare at prices based on
Healthcare's expected operating results, rather than based on
"arms-length negotiations."
   Because Healthcare began to run short of cash last year
and began to miss mortgage and interest payments to
HealthVest, the real estate investment trust had to reduce
the value of some assets, the auditor said.
   Healthcare's liquidity bind also has resulted in a cash
crunch at HealthVest, putting it in default of its senior
debt agreements. Because Healthcare's ability to meet its
current and future obligations to HealthVest isn't clear, the
auditor said that the trust might not be able to continue to
operate.
   HealthVest stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $3
a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
