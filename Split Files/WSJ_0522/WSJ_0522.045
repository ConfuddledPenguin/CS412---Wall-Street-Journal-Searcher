   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Applebee's International Inc. said it
received "unsolicited contacts" from parties interested in
acquiring "all or a substantial portion" of the company.
   The restaurant franchiser didn't identify who had made the
overtures, but said "no merger or sale negotiations are under
way."

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Applebee's
shares jumped $1.75 to close at $18.50.
   The company has some 4,705,000 shares outstanding, giving
it a value of about $87 million at yesterday's closing price.
   Applebee's said it retained the securities firm Piper,
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. to help it "in evaluating long-term
corporate strategy, including these unsolicited contacts, and
in determining whether any changes in strategy would be
desirable to enhance stockholder value." Piper Jaffray is a
unit of Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray Inc.
   At the close of the latest quarter, Applebee's had 19
company-owned restaurants and 104 franchise restaurants.
First-quarter earnings, helped by a $296,000 tax credit, were
$735,000, or 16 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
loss of $363,000, or 12 cents a share, on fewer shares
outstanding. Revenue, including franchise income and sales
from company restaurants, rose 39% to $8.8 million.
