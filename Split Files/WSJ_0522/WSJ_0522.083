   Perhaps the most significant and least appreciated fact of
the savings and loan disaster is that the size of the
taxpayers' bill -- whether it be $50 billion or $250 billion
-- will depend on the government's ability to sell the assets
of the failed thrifts.
   Astronomical figures for the cost of the bailout, which
grab the headlines in the face of the uncertainty that
surrounds this endeavor, may even be on the low side. What is
often overlooked is that the principal sum is a net figure,
the difference between government liabilities (what it must
pay insured depositors) and government receipts (what it
collects from the sale of assets). Thus a price tag of $50
billion is an estimate that the government will pay out that
much more than it receives.

   The government has yet to demonstrate its ability to sell
repossessed assets. In fact, some may even question whether
it has ever demonstrated the desire to sell such assets. That
is why the attitude of L. William Seidman, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution Trust
Corporation, is so refreshing. He has made it clear he is
ready to deal now.
   Of course, the market is very depressed. Congress made the
thrifts and their assets very unattractive to buy. For the
most part, the government will have to sell the thrifts'
assets to help pay off insured depositors. While performing
assets may go for a fair return, who will buy that vast sea
of bad assets, which Mr. Seidman refers to as "opportunity"
assets? He has correctly characterized the sale of illiquid
"opportunity" assets as "where our game will ultimately be
won or lost."
   I am greatly concerned that there will not be a market for
these bad assets at a price that will generate necessary
returns to hold taxpayer burdens in line with government
projections. If, for example, the government has to pay out
$450 billion to insured depositors, then it must collect $400
billion for the assets in order to hold losses to $50
billion, as originally estimated in the S&amp;L legislation.
   Mr. Seidman states: "If a property doesn't sell, it
probably will be because we're asking too much and we'll have
to reduce our price." But if we collect only $300 billion for
the assets, the taxpayer is on the hook for $150 billion, not
just $50 billion. The taxpayer, of course, foots the bill for
the losses.
   If we continue on this path, the assets probably will not
sell at the price necessary to limit taxpayer's liability to
$50 billion. Then, whatever the ultimate loss, the government
will issue Treasury securities to raise the cash to pay off
insured depositors and the taxpayer will pay billions in
interest and principal.
   But wait] It doesn't have to be that expensive. If the
interest were offered to asset purchasers as a guarantee of
income rather than to purchasers of Treasury securities, the
worst that could happen is a wash and the best is that the
principal payment would be saved.
   My idea would work like this: Suppose that the RTC assets
(real estate assets, in this example) had to be sold for $400
billion, close to book value, to keep the taxpayer loss down
to $50 billion. But the market is depressed and the fair
market value today for all the assets is, let us say, only
$300 billion. The government would sell RTC assets coupled
with a special Treasury security in an amount to bridge the
gap between the low selling price of the asset and its
"necessary" value to keep taxpayer losses down. In this
example, the special securities issued would total $100
billion, the difference between $400 billion and $300
billion.
   The purchasers of the asset and the special security would
have several options. They could hold both, sell both, or
part with one. The holders of the security would receive
interest payments for 20 years regardless of the value of the
connected asset. At maturity, if the asset had appreciated to
at least the necessary value, the government would not be
obligated to pay anything. If the asset had depreciated, the
government would pay the principal in full, as it would on a
mature Treasury security. If the asset had appreciated some,
but not up to necessary value, the government would pay the
difference between its actual value and the necessary value.
   How would its actual value be established? Any sale of the
asset at or above the necessary value during the 20-year
period should absolve the government of paying the principal
on the security. If no such sale occurred, then any
arm's-length sale within the three years preceding maturity
would be conclusive. Absent such a sale, the holder of the
security who believed that the government owed money to him
could establish that fact by requesting, at his expense, a
government appraisal of the value of the connected asset. If
would not be necessary for the security holder to own the
connected asset.
   In my opinion, the occasions for government payment would
be rare. If some skeptics do not share my faith in rising RTC
asset values (now very depressed) or in the march of
inflation, the 20-year period could be extended to 30 or even
40 years. Extensions of time would provide greater assurance
against the payment of principal but would require
commensurate interest payments over a longer period.
   The purchasers of the asset and security package from the
RTC would be getting a fair value -- an asset guaranteed by
the government to rise in value and, in addition, interest
payments for a period of years. The purchaser would have
complete freedom to sell all or part of his investment. The
government would obtain the necessary cash to pay off
depositors now while also profiting from the appreciation of
assets it has sold.
   Most important, the government would be able to raise the
money to cover the shortfall the RTC is now experiencing
without, in all likelihood, having to pay it back. Since this
shortfall may well be in the hundreds of billions of dollars,
my proposal would save that amount over the costs of
traditional government financing.
   I have written to the RTC Oversight Board to suggest that
the board do some creative thinking to "make a market" for
RTC assets. The members' response, while thoughtful,
basically rested on the belief that there currently exists a
healthy market for RTC assets. Recent news stories show that
belief may be crumbling. Moreover, there appears to be some
skepticism regarding the wisdom of any enhancements,
primarily due to the negative reactions to the December 1988
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corporation deals.
   The RTC has set asset sales for the next few months. My
guess is that if the assets, particularly the real estate
assets, are sold at all, they will go for distressed prices.
And nothing very creative is planned to save the taxpayer.
Mr. Seidman has been quoted as saying that if there is no
sale at lower prices, then "we scratch our heads."
   It is not uncommon for the seller of an apartment or
office building to guarantee the buyer a year or two of full
occupancy when the buyer has doubts about near-term prospects
but confidence in the more distant future. Such enhancements
are not giveaways, but simply a private-sector method for
creating a market. We need to do the same.
