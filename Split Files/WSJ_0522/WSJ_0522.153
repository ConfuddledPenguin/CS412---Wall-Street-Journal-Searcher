   WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan congressional group charges
that 14 of El Salvador's 15 top military officers, including
the defense minister and the chief of staff, have commanded
military units during their careers that committed serious
human-rights abuses.
   In a new report, the congressional Arms Control and
Foreign Policy Caucus traces how the officers' careers
advanced despite their troops' corruption and crimes against
civilians. The report comes as the House is set to vote today
on a proposal to withhold 50% of U.S. military aid from El
Salvador. The vote could signal the beginning of a breakdown
in bipartisan support for El Salvador, congressional aides
say. Congress has approved virtually every White House
request for such funds since 1984.

   Although the U.S. has provided El Salvador $1 billion in
military aid over the past decade and called regularly for
reform, the 39-page report raises serious questions "as to
whether the officer corps has either been above the law in
allowing repeated abuses of human rights to occur on their
watch, or, at a minimum, has shown serious problems of
competence in failing to halt them."
   The report states that no military officers have been
brought to trial in nearly 50 cases of human-rights abuses
reported by monitoring groups, suggesting that "at a basic
level, there is little accountability." The murder last
November of six Jesuit priests, reportedly at the hands of
military personnel, has focused Congress's attention again on
human-rights abuses by El Salvador's military.
   One reason for a lack of accountability, the report says,
is that most Salvadoran officers' primary loyalty is to
members of their class at the nation's military academy,
rather than to the armed forces as a whole or to civilian
authorities. The report asserts that this is particularly
true for the class of 1966, whose members currently are in
senior positions. The report says members of this class have
successfully resisted efforts by the U.S. embassy to force
the retirement of corrupt officers or those believed
responsible for human-rights abuses.
   The leader of that class, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, is now
military chief of staff. He formerly was deputy director of
the Treasury Police, which killed 30 civilians during a sweep
of the Soyapango district of San Salvador on April 7, 1981,
according to the State Department. Similar abuses occurred
when Gen. Rafael Humberto Larios, currently the defense
minister, commanded the Artillery Brigade in 1986 and 1987,
the report says.
   Along with the concern about human-rights abuses in
Salvador's military, a general decline in U.S. interest in
Central America is undermining congressional support for
Salvadoran aid. The end of the Cold War and the electoral
defeat of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas by Violeta
Chamorro, a staunch U.S. ally, have greatly reduced U.S.
concerns about the spread of communism in this hemisphere.
The Bush administration now is preoccupied with the sweeping
changes under way in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   "This is probably the end of the blank check for military
aid to El Salvador," says Robert Kurz, a Central America
expert at the Brookings Institution.
   Under the aid plan that the House is expected to consider
today, the 50% cut in military assistance would be restored
if leftist guerrillas battling Salvador's government launch a
new offensive or refuse to negotiate. Alternatively, military
aid would be completely eliminated if the government doesn't
conduct a thorough investigation of the murder of the Jesuits
or refuses to negotiate with guerrillas, or if there is a
military coup.
