   The United Steelworkers Union said it reached a labor
contract covering 2,000 workers at Kennecott Corp.'s Bingham
Canyon open-pit copper mine near Salt Lake City, Utah.
   Union officials said the details of the contract hadn't
yet been disclosed to the membership. But they noted the
three-year pact, which begins July 1, represents a more than
20% improvement over present wages. The present contract,
expiring June 30, lowered the wage rate for Kennecott workers
to about $10 an hour from roughly $13.75 prior to 1986 when
the concessionary pact took effect.

   Wayne Holland, a USW sub-district director, said the new
contract also provides for improvements in pension and
insurance coverage.
   Kennecott, based in Salt Lake City and a unit of
London-based RTZ Corp., declined to comment on the new pact.
   A spokesman for Asarco Inc., New York, said negotiations
with the union, which started a week ago, are continuing.
Asarco's contract also expires June 30.
   An official of Phelps Dodge Corp., Phoenix, said a
settlement hasn't yet been reached in talks with the union
affecting about 900 workers at one of the company's New
Mexico mines.
   Thomas Foster, vice president and controller, said the
company is offering "a significant increase" in employees'
benefits package. He estimated the company's offer at an
increase of 20% from the previous contract's total
compensation.
