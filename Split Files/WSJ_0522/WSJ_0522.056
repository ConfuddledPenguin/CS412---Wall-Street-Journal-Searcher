   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., in what is rapidly becoming a
public-relations headache for the soft-drink giant, is
struggling to get its $100 million "MagiCans" promotion on
track.
   Problems with a prize-delivery mechanism in the cans,
which contain millions of dollars in cash and prizes,
prompted the company last week to temporarily halt
distribution of the MagiCans. Coke is now planning new
advertising to better educate consumers about how the cans
are supposed to work. And the company has been talking with
government health officials to assure them that the cans pose
no risks.

   One person involved in Coke's plans said the
decision-making process last Friday was like a roller
coaster, with Coke marketers deciding at one point to proceed
with the promotion, then hours later to postpone it.
   "The MagiCans have been very disruptive," said a
soft-drink industry executive familiar with the internal
turmoil. "They have been taking up so much of their time."
   A Coke spokesman yesterday said the company has decided to
proceed with distributing the cans and had "come up with a
method of assuring there are no malfunctioning MagiCans." He
acknowledged, however, that some MagiCans already on store
shelves may still have some defects.
   Perhaps most troublesome to Coke is that the problems are
snagging what it has called its biggest promotion ever -- the
lottery-like distribution of prizes in some 750,000 MagiCans.
The cans are the core of a $100 million summer promotion for
flagship Coca-Cola Classic, which includes commercials with
vocal group New Kids on the Block and giveaways at fountain
outlets.
   The MagiCans seem like ordinary cans of Coke, although
they don't include the soft drink. When a buyer pops the top,
a device is supposed to rise through the opening in the can
and display a curled-up legal tender or a scroll of paper,
redeemable for prizes.
   Acknowledging the problems, Coke projects that fewer than
1% of all the cans will malfunction. Since Coke began
distributing the cans May 7, the company says there have been
18 complaints from consumers regarding mechanical problems
with the prize-delivery mechanism.
   Sometimes people had trouble removing the prize from the
cans. In one case, the liquid inside was drunk by an
11-year-old Massachusetts boy who wasn't aware of the
promotion.
   It was that case that prompted health officials in
Massachusetts to analyze the liquid in the can. In addition
to the water, "the material found in there was toxic" but at
levels too low to be harmful, said a spokesman in the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health. He said the toxic
materials appear to have come from an adhesive used to attach
the prize-delivery device to the can. "From a health
perspective, this is not a problem," he said.
   In order to determine which mechanisms have broken inside
the cans, Coca-Cola people have been shaking the MagiCans in
recent days, listening for rattles. A clunker is called a
"floater" because the broken mechanism floats inside the can.
   Meanwhile, Coke is planning new advertising, urging
consumers to "take a good look" at a can of Coca-Cola
Classic. Besides warning people not to drink from a MagiCan,
the ad describes the difference between a working MagiCan and
one that's broken.
