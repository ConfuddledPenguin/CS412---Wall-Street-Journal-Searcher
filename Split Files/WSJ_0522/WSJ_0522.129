   DALLAS -- In another effort to stave off a bankruptcy
filing, strikebound Greyhound Lines Inc. offered to redeem
about $225 million in face amount of debt for about $101.6
million in cash. But how the cash-strapped unit of GLI
Holding Co. will finance the offer remains uncertain.
   J. Michael Doyle, Greyhound senior vice president and
chief financial officer, said Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., its
financial adviser in connection with the offering, has held
preliminary discussions with several parties but no source of
funding has been found. "The financing is not clear," said
Mr. Doyle. "With our company in our situation, it's pretty
tough."

   The debt-burdened bus company has been battered by an
11-week-old strike by 9,400 employees represented by the
Amalgamated Transit Union. For the first quarter of this
year, Greyhound posted a $55.8 million loss on revenue of
$172.5 million. For the same period a year ago, Greyhound
lost $14.4 million on revenue of $223.5 million.
   Although the company has continued to operate with a
replacement work force, Mr. Doyle estimated that the strike
will ultimately cost Greyhound between $75 million and $100
million in lost revenue and additional costs for security,
legal fees and new driver training.
   If Greyhound can find funding for the tender offer, it
plans to offer $540 in cash for each $1,000 face value of its
13% senior notes due in 1995 and $275 in cash for each $1,000
face value for up to 85% of its 12.5% senior subordinated
notes due 1997. The company is seeking to redeem up to 85% of
each issue.
   The company said the offer is contingent upon a majority
of the face amount outstanding of each of the two debt issues
being tendered and upon the holders of a majority of the
outstanding notes consenting to the elimination of many of
the covenants of the old debt. Greyhound said the offer is
also contingent upon the company being able to raise an
undisclosed amount of money to "satisfy its immediate working
capital needs."
   Greyhound has already missed a $9.8 million interest
payment, due May 15, on the 13% notes.
   With those notes trading at deeply discounted levels in
recent weeks, bond analysts said the offer might be
attractive to holders who bought the notes at distressed
levels. Those who purchased the notes at par value, however,
may have a harder time accepting the tender offer.
   "They have to make the decision as to whether this is the
best they are going to get," said Ken Frankel, an analyst
with Drake Securities.
   "It's a very disappointing situation all around," said a
longtime institutional holder of the Greyhound bonds. "My
only regret is that I didn't sell out in December."

   GREYHOUND LINES INC., a unit of Dallas-based GLI Holding
Co., offered to redeem about $191 million in face amount of
debt for about $86 million in cash. The figures were
incorrectly stated in yesterday's edition.
