   DAVIS, Calif. -- Researchers at the University of
California School of Medicine here said a bacteria commonly
found in the soil may be one of the causes of Parkinson's
disease.
   The researchers, using tests on mice and rats, said a
pathogenic strain of Nocardia asteroids, a common soil
organism, caused neurological signs that "appear to be
identical" to those shown by people with Parkinson's.

   Parkinson's disease afflicts about a million Americans,
primarily those over age 55, and is characterized by limb
rigidity and head shaking. The research was reported last
week at the annual American Society for Microbiology meeting
in Anaheim, Calif.
