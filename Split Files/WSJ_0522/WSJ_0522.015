   NEW CANAAN, Conn. -- Smith Corona Corp. named William D.
Henderson president and chief operating officer, a newly
created post, effective July 1.
   Mr. Henderson, 43 years old, was previously executive
officer and group vice president at Hanson Industries, the
U.S. unit of London-based Hanson PLC, which spun off the
maker of electronic typewriters, word processors and office
supplies last summer and retains about a 48% interest in
Smith Corona.

   Although Mr. Henderson had been a Hanson executive, a
Smith Corona spokesman said the appointment to the new post
wasn't dictated by Hanson. He pointed out that Mr. Henderson
and Smith Corona Chairman Lee Thompson have been close
friends and worked together for a number of years. The
appointment "made sense," the spokesman said. He said the
company had been looking for a president since it went public
last year.
   Smith Corona has had some difficulties since its initial
public offering in July, and recently reported a 51% drop in
fiscal-third quarter net income, reflecting slow sales of
higher priced products and pricing competition from Asia. It
also had some layoffs last year.
