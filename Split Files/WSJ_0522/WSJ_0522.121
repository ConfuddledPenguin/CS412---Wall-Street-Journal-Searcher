   K mart Corp., citing an emphasis on lower shelf prices,
said net income for its first quarter ended May 2 increased
6.4% on a 16% rise in sales.
   The Troy, Mich., discount retailer said net income was
$100.1 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with the
year-earlier $94.1 million, or 47 cents a share. Sales rose
to $7.04 billion from $6.07 billion.

   The earnings also reflect the inclusion of K mart's
recently acquired Pace Membership Warehouse stores, the
company said.
   K mart noted that net interest expense rose to $56.5
million from $33.2 million, primarily because of greater
short-term borrowing for high inventory levels, but also
partially related to the recent $322 million Pace
acquisition.
   The company said it is "encouraged by the improvement in
sales in the first quarter and in early May," and said it
anticipates "an improving trend in sales and earnings."
