   UAL Corp., Chicago, said the French government agreed to
allow its United Airlines unit to operate nonstop
Chicago-Paris flights, beginning Aug. 1.
   The company said the approval, coupled with an earlier
authorization from the U.S. Department of Transportation,
"clears the way for United to inaugurate service to its
second European city this summer." United began its first
flights to Europe last week, with service to Frankfurt, West
Germany. The Paris flights represent "another important step"
in the company's plan to expand its international service,
UAL said.
