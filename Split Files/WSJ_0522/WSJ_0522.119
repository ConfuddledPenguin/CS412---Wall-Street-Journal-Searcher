   Jamaica Savings Bank, a Lynbrook, N.Y.-based mutual
savings bank, said it is converting to a stock savings bank
through a public offering of 16 million shares of common
stock.
   A mutual savings bank is privately held, basically owned
by its depositors. The new shares are being offered to
depositors, other customers and certain members of the
general public at prices in the range of $7.50 to $10 a
share. The mutual savings bank said the final price will be
set after the completion of the offering on June 21. Jamaica
Savings had deposits of $1.23 billion and retained earnings
of $197.1 million as of Dec. 31. Most of its offices are in
Queens County.
