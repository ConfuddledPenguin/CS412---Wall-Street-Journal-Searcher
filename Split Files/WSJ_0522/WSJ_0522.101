   MILPITAS, Calif. -- Qume Corp. said its board approved a
sweetened $86 million, or $7.25 a share, buy-out proposal
from a group including its chairman and chief executive
officer, David Lee, and Singapore-based Wearnes Technology
(Pte) Ltd.
   The offer compares with previous per-share offers from the
group of $6.50 and $6.75. The Lee group already holds about
22% of Qume's roughly 11.8 million common shares outstanding.

   Qume, a computer-products maker, said the agreement is
subject to several conditions, including shareholder
approval, which is expected to be sought no later than
September. Qume said its investment banker, First Boston
Corp., is continuing to solicit other offers for the company.
   Separately, Qume reported net income for the fiscal-fourth
quarter ended Feb. 28 of $827,000, or seven cents a share,
compared with net of $2 million, or 17 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales slipped 2.8% to $54.5 million from $56.1
million. The latest quarter included a $2 million operating
loss, which was more than offset by a $6.9 million gain from
the sale of stock of a Taiwanese subsidiary.
   For the fiscal year, Qume net rose 72% to $8.7 million, or
73 cents a share from $5 million, or 43 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 21% to $222.3 million from $183.2
million.
