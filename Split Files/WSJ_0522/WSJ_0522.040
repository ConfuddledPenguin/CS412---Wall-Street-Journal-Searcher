   STOCKHOLM -- The deficit on Sweden's current account, or
balance of payments, widened to 3.3 billion kronor ($548.1
million) in March from a deficit of 600 million kronor a year
earlier, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said.
   The gap on the current account, which includes traded
items, services and transfers, grew from the 3.1
billion-krona deficit recorded in February, the Riksbank
said.
