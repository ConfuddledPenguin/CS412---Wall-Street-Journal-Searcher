   Carolco Pictures Inc. said Canal Plus Productions, a
wholly owned unit of Canal Plus S.A., a French pay-television
concern, has taken a 5% stake in the Los Angeles-based
entertainment concern as part of a production agreement
between the two companies.
   Carolco said the Canal Plus unit will buy $30 million in
new Carolco Series B convertible preferred shares. The
preferred stock will be convertible into Carolco common at
$18.50 a share and will pay a yearly dividend of 5%. Canal
Plus also will receive a warrant to purchase 150,000 Carolco
shares at $18.50, Carolco said. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Carolco common shares closed at
$13, up 25 cents.

   The companies also announced their intention to form a new
joint venture to produce films. Canal Plus will appoint a
representative to join Carolco's board. The agreement follows
recent announcements by Canal Plus executives that the
company wants to broaden its fledgling film-production
business.
