   TOKYO -- With the potential for a global capital shortage
looming, many Japanese are embracing the notion that Japan's
huge external surpluses are essential to the world's economic
health.
   That view, until recently political anathema in the face
of grinding trade frictions between Japan and other
countries, suddenly is gaining acceptance among economists,
bankers and industrialists in Japan. They say that the cash
Japan accumulates through its persistent current-account
surpluses can be used to help fund the huge cost of unifying
Germany, rebuilding Eastern Europe and covering chronically
large U.S. budget deficits.

   The current account measures a nation's net income from
trade, services and investment. In the year ended last March
31, Japan's current-account surplus was $53.5 billion, down
from $77.3 billion a year earlier.
   To be sure, most government officials here remain publicly
skeptical that the rest of the world suddenly will come to
accept Japan's persistent current-account surpluses.
Politicians in Washington and Brussels, where the European
Community has its headquarters, still campaign loudly for
Japan to trim its trade surplus, and officials here insist
reduction remains a goal.
   "Our policy of trying to reduce the surplus is still
there," says one government official. "The policy has not
changed yet," he adds, though he notes the subject might come
up after the conclusion of ongoing structural economic talks
with the U.S. and the July summit of the seven major
industrialized countries in Houston.
   "The adjustment process is expected to go on," a senior
official of the Bank of Japan says. But, he adds, "at the
same time we are expected to provide the world with capital,
with savings."
   That expectation, officials say, was endorsed by the
publication last month of an economic outlook by the
International Monetary Fund that contained a section
suggesting the world might not want to reduce Japan's
surpluses too quickly as credit gets scarce in Europe and the
U.S. Japanese officials quickly subscribed to that view,
hoping that other governments will see the logic of allowing
Japan to become something of a financial anchor to the world,
providing a stable source of capital at a time when demand
for money is expected to be huge.
   Bush administration officials say the U.S. is still eager
to get Japan to reduce its trade surplus, which has become a
glaring symbol for those in Congress and the administration
who believe Japanese trading practices are unfair.
   But a smaller trade surplus also would mean the Japanese
would have less money to lend the U.S. And at a time when
U.S. savings are still low and estimates of the budget
deficit are rising, that could lead to higher interest rates.
"There is a certain Jekyll and Hyde reaction," one
administration official said. "We want their savings to
finance things, but we don't want the trade surplus."
   Ideally, the U.S. government would like to boost U.S.
savings, cut the budget deficit, and reduce the nation's
dependence on foreign capital. But until that happens,
Japanese capital could prove critical in keeping interest
rates down. "Better American capital than Japanese capital,"
says economist Lawrence Summers of Harvard University, "but
better Japanese capital than no capital."
   The most pressing need for cash is in Europe. West
Germany, which like Japan is the beneficiary of persistent
current-account surpluses, has been the biggest supplier of
funds to the Continent for years. Last year, its surplus
amounted to about 90 billion marks ($54.62 billion), or about
4.5% of the country's total economic output.
   But the cost of reunifying East Germany and West Germany,
a process that will start this year, is expected to cost as
much as 95 billion marks. Although finance officials in Bonn
have said they hope to raise that amount domestically, their
efforts will soak up much of the surplus capital that
normally flows from West Germany.
   That means other European countries, accustomed to German
capital, will have to look elsewhere for investment. Money
will be especially scarce because of the ambitious
development plans of many newly capitalist Eastern European
nations.
   "If the supply of capital from Japan were to disappear,
there would be problems in connection with Eastern Europe,"
says Takunori Kobayashi, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co.'s
research arm. Adds Keikichi Honda, the chief economist and a
director of Bank of Tokyo: "The world after 1991 will be
entering a new phase of international economy where savings
is needed; someone has to provide the money, and it certainly
can't be the U.S."
   Indeed, many Japanese economists argue that the U.S.
itself is ever-hungrier for Japanese money. With the U.S.
federal government saying it now faces an unplanned budget
shortfall of $150 billion or more, the Treasury is going to
be raising a lot of money through bond auctions. Japanese
investors, as usual, are expected to be among the biggest
buyers.
   The prospect of slaking a mighty thirst for money in the
U.S. and Europe has fueled talk that Japan will be encouraged
to sustain its surpluses. "People are saying, `Gee whiz,
let's have a second think about it, especially if there's
going to be such a capital shortage in the world,'" says Paul
A. Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming Securities
Co. "But that's very difficult to translate into something
that's politically palatable."
   Besides, notes Richard Koo, an economist at the research
unit of Nomura Securities Co., the capital surpluses
accumulating in Japan don't belong to the government, but to
private companies. "Even if they were asked to recirculate
the surplus to Eastern Europe, the companies won't do it
unless they find anything beneficial in it for themselves."
   For now, the idea remains confined to the academic realm.
In January, for the first time in six years, Japan's current
account slipped into deficit, largely because of shrinking
trade surpluses and a heavy outflow of money related to
services. The closest the government has come to endorsing
the idea of surpluses is to empanel a group from the Economic
Planning Agency to study the potential optimal level of
Japan's surpluses.
