   "Jogging is very boring,"
   I've heard many people say,
   But in all my years of jogging
   I've never found it that way.
   In fact, that little comment
   Really goes against the grain --
   How can it be boring
   While it's causing so much pain?
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   Once Is Enough
                                                                                                       

   The prospect of a second childhood
   I can face with acquiescence,
   Provided it doesn't lead to
   A second adolescence.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.
