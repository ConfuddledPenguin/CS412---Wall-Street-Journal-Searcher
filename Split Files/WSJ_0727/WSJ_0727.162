   Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., said it got a
contract valued at about $300 million to design and develop a
new jet engine thrust reverser for Pratt &amp; Whitney and to
produce 200 units.
   The thrust reversers, which redirect the flow of jet
engine exhaust and help brake aircraft after landing, will be
designed and produced by Martin Marietta Aero &amp; Naval Systems
in Baltimore.

   Martin Marietta said production will begin in 1993. The
contract includes provisions for follow-up production of as
many as 300 additional thrust reversers, potentially doubling
the value of the contract.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., is
based in East Hartford, Conn. The company designs and
produces commercial and military aircraft engines.
