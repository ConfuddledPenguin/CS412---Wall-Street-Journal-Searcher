   AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. reported a
second quarter net loss of $9.4 million, or 16 cents a share,
mainly as a result of a North American automobile slowdown, a
price war in Europe and economic problems of Brazil.
   Those problems will continue in the second half, Goodyear
said. Sales rose to $2.87 billion from $2.81 billion.

   The loss also reflected charges of $21.4 million, or 37
cents a share, partly offset by a tax-loss carry-forward of
$600,000, or two cents a share. The charges include costs of
restructuring parts of Goodyear's North American tire sales
and distribution operations and closing the New Bedford,
Mass., roofing systems plant.
   In the 1989 second quarter, net income was $27.1 million,
or 47 cents a share, after charges of $95 million, or $1.65 a
share, partly offset by a tax-loss carry-forward of $4.9
million, or eight cents a share. The charges included losses
on the sale of Goodyear's South African subsidiary and of
unused pipe owned by the All American Pipeline subsidiary.
   Goodyear had expected a loss of up to $10 million for the
1990 second quarter.
   Prices for replacement tires in North America were
depressed in the latest quarter because the slowdown in
automobile production created a tire surplus, according to
industry officials. Producers dumped into the replacement
market some tires they had produced for Detroit, resulting in
widespread discounting. While major producers have announced
price increases of 2% to 4% on replacement tires effective
next month, it remains to be seen how much of the increase
they will collect.
   In Europe, Japan's Bridgestone Tire Corp. and Michelin &amp;
Co. of France are fighting aggressively for market share,
slashing prices in the process. Goodyear, which has a major
market position in Europe, is trying to at least hold its
own.
   In addition, Goodyear has continuing strikes at its
Turkish tire plants and is feeling the impact of the economic
change by the Brazilian government.
   The 1990 quarter also reflects depreciation of the All
American Pipeline System and its operating and interest
expenses, which were capitalized until the 1989 fourth
quarter. Had those items been recognized in the 1989 second
period, it would have reduced profit $26.8 million, or 47
cents a share, the company said.
   In the first half, profit before extraordinary gains fell
to $6.5 million, or 11 cents a share, from $112.3 million, or
$1.95 a share, a year earlier. After tax-loss carry-forwards,
net was $11.5 million, or 20 cents a share, down from $121.6
million, or $2.11 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to
$5.56 billion from $5.45 billion.
