   GREENWICH, Conn. -- United Parcel Service of America Inc.
said it agreed with the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters to extend by 10 days the deadline for the return of
ballots on a three-year UPS contract. The deadline, which was
July 30, will be extended to Aug. 10.
   The agreement removes the possibility that teamsters would
strike the country's largest deliverer of packages when the
current three-year UPS contract expires at midnight Tuesday.

   UPS said the union sought to extend the deadline because
many teamster members had failed to receive their ballots in
the mail. The extension would allow more time for UPS
teamster workers to receive those ballots.
   About 140,000 UPS workers are eligible to vote on the
contract. The union has advised its members to reject the
company's "final" wage and benefit offer.
   UPS said it agreed that the contract, if approved, would
be retroactive to Wednesday.
   "We think it's a reasonable request under the
circumstances," said Kent C. Nelson, chairman and chief
executive of UPS. "We're glad it will enable more of our
people to cast votes on this important offer," he said.
