   OTTAWA -- Canadian spending on plant and equipment is now
expected to rise 6.4% this year, somewhat more slowly than
previously estimated, Statistics Canada, a federal agency,
said.
   The agency, which surveys spending intentions of
businesses and government agencies, had estimated in March
that capital spending this year would rise 7.4%.

   The latest spending estimate was bigger than expected by
some economic analysts who had predicted that many projects
would be shelved because of a drop in corporate profits in
the past year and because of a decline in business confidence
in Canada's economic outlook.
