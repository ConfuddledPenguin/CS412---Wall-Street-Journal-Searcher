   NEW YORK -- Just because an investment firm makes big
bucks managing a mutual fund, a shareholder can't win a suit
alleging excessive fees, a federal judge ruled.
   After a six-day trial, federal Judge Charles S. Haight Jr.
dismissed a shareholder's complaint that Franklin Resources
Inc. charged excessive fees for managing its $11.2 billion
Franklin U.S. Government Securities Fund.

   The New York federal court's ruling is the sixth
consecutive courtroom setback for investors accusing mutual
funds of charging exorbitant fees. Wall Street has paid close
attention to the Franklin case because it is the first of its
kind to go to trial involving a bond mutual fund. The
Franklin portfolio also is one of the largest funds in the
business.
   "There has never been an excessive-fee case won by a
plaintiff . . . but I'm still banging my head against the
wall," said Richard Meyer, the shareholder's New York lawyer
(who himself lost a similar case as a plaintiff last year).
He said he probably will appeal the Franklin case.
   The ruling stemmed from a 1987 suit filed by Lucyle Kalish
and Sol Joseph Kamen, alleging that Franklin, a big San
Mateo, Calif., fund company, charged excessive fees and that
management failed to fully inform the fund's directors about
the appropriateness of such fees.
   Franklin currently charges investors 0.45% annually to
manage the fund, which grew to a high of $15 billion in
assets in 1986 from $2 billion in 1984. Management fees
amounted to about $65 million at the fund's peak, said Daniel
Pollack, Franklin's attorney.
   "A main thrust of the plaintiffs' case is that Franklin
simply made too much money managing the fund," Judge Haight
wrote. But he said his ruling followed cases that "squarely
rejected a Calvinistic condemnation of joy through profit."
Franklin's after-tax profit from managing the fund, which the
judge said didn't exceed 35% of revenue, was "reasonable," he
said.
   "Plaintiffs have failed to prove that Franklin realized
economies of scale as the fund increased in size, or that
economies of scale, if realized, were not shared with
investors," the 70-page ruling said.
   Other excessive-fee cases that have gone to trial involved
money-market mutual funds. The new ruling shows that "courts
apply the same factors irrespective of the type of fund,"
says James Benedict, a partner at the law firm of Rogers &amp;
Wells who has handled similar cases.
