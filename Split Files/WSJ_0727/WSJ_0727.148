   First National Bank of Pennsylvania, Erie, Pa., said it
added $8.4 million to its provisions for loan losses for the
quarter ended June 30.
   The special provision increases the quarter's total
reserve for loan losses to $14.1 million. The parent company,
First National Pennsylvania Corp., said it will report a loss
for the first six months and anticipates a loss for the year.

   The bank, which is expected to release second-quarter
results next week, said the special provision was prompted by
a regular review by the comptroller of the currency.
