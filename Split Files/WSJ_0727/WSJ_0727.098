   NEW YORK -- Stock prices edged lower amid skittishness
about U.S. budget negotiations and a downdraft in technology
stocks that triggered selling in other sectors.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.15 points in
moderate trading to close at 2920.79. Bond prices ended
unchanged on little activity, with traders awaiting today's
preliminary report on economic growth in the second quarter.
The dollar ended mixed, with much of the activity focused on
a weakening Japanese yen.

   Stock investors turned cautious because of reports
indicating Congress is unlikely to agree on cutting the
budget deficit before the August recess. That attitude turned
more negative on earnings news from Microsoft and Compaq
Computer, which sparked the dip in technology stocks.
International Business Machines, for example, fell 1 5/8 to
113 1/8, which helped drag down the Dow industrials.
   But James Awad, president of BMI Capital, a
money-management firm, said investors overreacted to the news
from Microsoft and Compaq. Microsoft said higher expansion
costs will lead to lower profit margins, but Mr. Awad said
that comment indicates Microsoft is laying the groundwork for
future growth. And Compaq said its results were affected not
by weak demand but by a shortage of parts.
   "It's transitory," Mr. Awad said of the market's decline.
"The selling is not rooted in rational thinking. People just
don't like to see the past market leaders weaken."
   Mr. Awad said the budget-deficit factor also may be
overblown. The Federal Reserve has indicated that a credible
deficit-reduction plan will be rewarded with lower interest
rates, which would make stocks a more attractive investment
than bonds.
   "I think in two months Congress will have hammered
something {budget agreement} out that will calm the market,"
he says."
   Bond prices opened slightly higher in anticipation of
today's report showing weaker-than-expected economic growth.
But bonds eased after the Dow industrials abruptly dropped 30
points below Wednesday's close. Futures-related sell programs
caused that decline and subsequent rebound.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 155 million shares in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining
issues outnumbered advancers, 778 to 701.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were unchanged. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at to 8.54%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6245 German marks and 150.37 yen,
compared with 1.6250 marks and 149.89 yen Wednesday.
