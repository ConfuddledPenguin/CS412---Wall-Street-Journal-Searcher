   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board Options Exchange said it
fined Carolyn J. Olshansky, a market maker at the exchange,
$35,000 and suspended her for six months from associating
with any exchange member.
   Ms. Olshansky agreed to the sanction without admitting or
denying that she violated CBOE rules. She allegedly allowed a
floor broker to submit for clearance numerous option
transactions for her account, which she allowed to clear into
her account. She also allegedly knew or should have known
that the floor broker inappropriately favored her account by
making trades with her without using the exchange's open
outcry system.

   CBOE members said the floor broker, who wasn't named, was
Robert M. Donnelly. He was disciplined by the exchange late
last year, fined $70,000 and suspended from membership or
association with the exchange for a year.
   Neither Ms. Olshansky nor Mr. Donnelly could be reached
for comment.
   In a separate case, Peter H. Wright, a former registered
representative in the Palo Alto, Calif., office of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., was censured and suspended for six
months from association with any exchange member. Mr. Wright
allegedly traded options for two customer accounts without
the prior written approval of the customers and Dean Witter,
made unauthorized stock sales in a customer account and
exceeded an agreed-upon loss limitation in a customer
account.
   Mr. Wright agreed to the action without admitting or
denying he violated CBOE rules. Dean Witter wasn't
disciplined.
   In a third case, Darryl N. Myers, a former registered
representative in the Memphis, Tenn., office of Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc., was censured, fined $20,000 and
permanently barred from association with any exchange member.
   Mr. Myers, who failed to answer or deny the charges,
allegedly assured several customers that option trades for
their accounts would earn a specified minimum return, misled
customers about the performance of trades in their accounts
and used his own discretion in allocating profitable and
unprofitable orders among customers.
   Neither Mr. Wright nor Mr. Myers could be reached for
comment.
