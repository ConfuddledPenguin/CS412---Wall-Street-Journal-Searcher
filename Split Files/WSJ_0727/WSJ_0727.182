   The Air Force likes to boast of the years of "rigorous and
redundant testing" done to ensure the pinpoint accuracy of
its 1,715 nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
   Maintaining such high standards is essential, of course,
given that each of the weapons carries a 200-kiloton warhead,
10 times more powerful than the bomb that exploded over
Hiroshima.

   But heretofore secret Pentagon and corporate documents
raise disturbing questions about whether the cruise missile,
a mainstay of America's nuclear arsenal, is reliable when
exposed to the prolonged sub-zero temperatures at which it
was designed to operate. A fluid inside the weapon's
high-tech navigational system, these papers indicate, may
freeze long before it is supposed to.
   The Air Force and Northrop Corp., which supplied the
navigational system to prime contractor Boeing Co., have gone
to great lengths to mask the problem. A Boeing internal
report from January 1989, for example, shows that when the
suspect system was exposed to extremely low temperatures for
a prolonged period, its failure rate increased to the point
of being "unacceptable." But instead of fixing the part, the
Air Force simply decided to make the test less stringent
"until the cold-temperature behavior . . . was more fully
understood."
   The Justice Department has looked into aspects of the
problem in the past, and Northrop even pleaded guilty to
criminal charges of falsifying test results on the cruise
missile. But a decade of foot-dragging by the Pentagon and
Northrop has prevented Justice Department investigators and
lawmakers from fully understanding the low-temperature issue.
The air-launched cruise missile has become a glaring example
of how the military and its suppliers frequently work
together to keep vital but embarrassing information out of
the public eye.
   "It can only be called a cover-up," charges Rep. John
Dingell, chairman of a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee, which will hold a hearing today delving into
the cold problem and other Northrop dealings with the
Pentagon. "I can't think of another word to apply to it."
   The Justice Department is expected to tell the panel that
Northrop's cozy relationship with Pentagon officials was
"highly damaging to our ability to prosecute" the company,
and that military officials, by providing Northrop with
"formal and informal waivers" of low-temperature
requirements, allowed the company to reduce its criminal
liability. A Northrop spokesman bristles: "They appear,
unfairly, to be trying us outside the courtroom."
   Despite the easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions, the cruise
missile remains a central element of what Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney calls a "strategy of fostering democracy and
peace . . . by maintaining nuclear deterrence." It is also an
important potential bargaining chip in arms-control talks.
Some argue further that weapons such as the air-launched
cruise missile, commonly called the ALCM, remain powerful
deterrents to Third World countries developing their own
nuclear weapons.
   In case of a crisis, high-flying B-52 bombers might linger
for hours over frigid terrain before releasing some of the 12
cruise missiles that hang under their wings. A militarywide
standard dictates that the missiles must be able to function
down to 65 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, a temperature often
encountered as the bombers soar six or seven miles above the
earth. Although there are safeguards to prevent a faulty
launch, the glitch with the navigational fluid could
conceivably throw a nuclear weapon off course.
   "We conclude that the fluid would not allow proper
operation below -35 F for extended periods of time," an April
1990 internal Air Force memo states. The document, which was
reviewed by this newspaper, notes that some Air Force experts
are concerned the missile may not have an adequate "safety
margin" to guarantee dependable operation.
   Officially, however, the Air Force insists that the ALCM
is "a reliable and fully mission-capable weapons system in
which we have complete confidence." According to the
Strategic Air Command, typical test flights subject the
missile to five hours of "sub-zero degree temperatures prior
to launch," and "as far as we can determine," there have been
no problems with its operational capability after hundreds of
flight tests.
   Northrop, which has argued that its manufacturing
processes were thoroughly checked out and approved by both
Boeing and the Air Force, points to the same numbers. Boeing,
though it declines comment, has echoed those statistics, too.
   Yet there is no doubt the Justice Department has
encountered opposition when trying to get behind those
figures.
   Northrop was indicted in April 1989 on charges of
falsifying test results on two weapons systems, including the
cruise. The government also accused the Los Angeles aerospace
company of providing navigational units for the missile that
didn't meet the 65-below-zero requirement.
   But nine months before those charges were brought, a
Justice Department letter to Tinker Air Force Base in
Oklahoma complained that "affirmative steps were taken" by
military officials there "to conceal" from criminal
investigators damaging information that the Northrop
navigational units "may freeze" and become "inoperative"
under certain conditions.
   A second Justice Department letter, written in November
1988 to the general then in charge of keeping the ALCM fleet
in tip-top shape, assailed the Air Force for ignoring
warnings that the missile could fail to function under
"likely combat conditions."
   A Los Angeles assistant U.S. Attorney, William Fahey,
wrote that some Air Force personnel seemed to believe that
because the Northrop-made parts "function well at room
temperature . . . therefore there is no need for concern
about performance in cold temperature." Such a stance, Mr.
Fahey added, "could undercut our legal position" in
prosecuting Northrop.
   Even after Northrop's indictment, Mr. Fahey was still
complaining to the Pentagon that if the Air Force wasn't more
careful in how it dealt with the company's requests for
waivers from cold standards and other requirements, it risked
"undermining our case." (The letters were obtained by Mr.
Dingell, who agreed to answer questions about them. Mr. Fahey
has been unreachable this week, his office said.)
   The prosecutor also accused Boeing, Northrop and Air Force
officials of negotiating a "confidence building" test plan
that "would not subject the {navigational units} to
cold-temperature testing under realistic conditions." Stung
by the criticism, the Air Force responded at the time that
its testing procedures "should be viewed as neutral,
independent assessments . . . made without reference to any
pending legal proceeding."
   Pentagon acquisition chief John Betti acknowledges that
over the years "there may have been isolated problems" when
defense officials hampered Justice Department investigators.
   "Our people aren't there only to help Justice make a
case," Mr. Betti says. He adds that the two agencies are now
determined to find "how we can work better together."
   Although Northrop eventually pleaded guilty to falsifying
certain tests on the cruise and the Navy's Harrier jet and
coughed up $17 million in penalties, the government signed a
settlement that dropped all the cold-temperature-related
charges. At the time, Mr. Fahey said abandoning the
cold-temperature allegation was simply a matter of "how much
you really need to squeeze out of a corporation before you've
made your point."
   Still, the haze surrounding the missile program leaves the
most important question of all unanswered: How well does the
air-launched cruise work in the real world?
   The cold-temperature standard seeks simply to assure that
the missile will work right at 65 below zero. But there has
been much dispute among Northrop, the Pentagon and the
Justice Department over how that temperature should be
measured, how long the parts need to be subjected to cold in
testing, and whether there should be a brief warm-up before
the navigational system has to perform. Northrop has
maintained that its scientists believe that the 65-below-zero
specification is meaningless because the navigational fluid
never gets anywhere near that cold, regardless of the
altitude or duration of a bomber flight.
   Yet the internal Boeing report, which reviews 41 bomber
missions, lists a dozen instances during the 1980s where the
temperature outside the aircraft was measured or estimated to
be lower than 65 below zero.
   The standard is "based on a world climatological study,"
explains Air Force Gen. Charles Franklin, who is in charge of
another project, the Amraam missile. Even Thomas V. Jones,
Northrop's chairman, conceded in a sworn deposition taken
last December: "I have seen 87 degrees minus {outside} our
own airplane."
   How much warmer it might be inside the missile, where the
Northrop navigational unit controls the autopilot, has been
the subject of intense debate. Congressional investigators
say the Air Force has told them heat generated by the
missile's electronic inner workings raises the internal
temperature at least 20 degrees.
   But in light of the temperatures recorded by Boeing, even
a 20-degree differential means the fluid in the ALCM's
navigational unit still could freeze, considering the
35-below-zero threshold that the Air Force document
identifies.
   The cruise missile, which weighs 3,000 pounds and is
nearly 21 feet long, is designed to drop down and hug the
ground as it speeds toward its target. The Northorp-built
navigational unit, formally called a flight-data transmitter,
helps keep the missile on a stable pre-planned path. It
consists of several gyroscopes surrounded by the viscous
fluid, known as DC-200.
   This silicone damping fluid sells for $3.40 a pound. But
on it center doubts about a $1.7 billion weapons program.
   Produced by Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical
Co. and Corning Inc., DC-200 comes in many versions and has
thousands of military and industrial uses, from clocks and
timers to transformers and switches. The manufacturer
contends Northrop was warned when it ordered the fluid that
it wouldn't function properly at colder than minus-40. "We
provided these specs to Northrop," says a Dow Corning
spokesman. "They took it from there."
   Northrop disputes that. In an internal report three years
ago, it said Dow Corning "has always provided our engineering
personnel with the assurance that our gyros would
successfully meet operating requirements at -65 F." A letter
from Dow Corning to Northrop, written years before
cruise-missile production even began, supports this
contention. It says data collected by Dow Corning showed
DC-200 to have "a freeze point of -67 F," adding that "this
material, if cooled rapidly, will remain liquid at
temperatures as low as -85 F due to supercooling."
   In any case, somewhere along the line, Northrop came to
realize it had a problem. Although the company insists that
its navigational unit meets all the tests required by the
government, Northrop's 1987 internal report, which has been
filed in U.S. district court in Los Angeles, states flatly:
"DC-200 does not meet the -65 F requirement and never did."
   Later tests provided corroboration. The January 1989
Boeing study, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, shows that
six out of nine gyroscopes failed after being kept at
minus-65 degrees for up to two hours; technicians at the
Seattle company had to raise the temperature to minus-40
before the DC-200 would thaw enough for all the gyros to spin
freely.
   Boeing, Northrop and the Air Force all discount the
significance of cold-temperature tests conducted in the
laboratory. Instead, the companies emphasize that frigid air
has triggered only two failures during hundreds of actual
test flights.
   But some wonder how valid the test flights have been.
Congressional investigators say the Air Force, apparently
wary of colder temperatures at higher altitudes, has urged
that the bombers carrying cruise missiles fly at a ceiling of
roughly 32,000 feet. Before the cold-temperature issue
erupted, Strategic Air Command crews were authorized to take
their planes to 50,000 feet.
   Further fallout from the cruise-missile imbroglio is
imminent. The House Government Operations Committee is
planning its own hearings this fall, examining the missile's
cold-temperature track record and whether the Air Force
should continue to provide new contracts to some Northrop
divisions. To continue things as usual with Northrop "creates
the spectacle of the government doing business with the very
same {individuals} who mugged the taxpayers in the first
place," says Rep. Frank Horton of New York, the ranking
Republican on the committee.
   The General Accounting Office is beginning to try to
determine whether other weapons that use DC-200 might
possibly be impaired, such as the B-1 bomber and the Harpoon
missile. Significantly, the nextgeneration air-launched
cruise missile doesn't include any fluid in its flight-data
transmitter.
   But the most serious repercussion could be on Northrop's
bottom line. Air Force Secretary Donald Rice is currently
weighing Justice Department suggestions to bar the subsidiary
that made the navigational components from new federal
contracts, say congressional investigators; the unit has been
suspended for the past year. Some prosecutors take the
extreme position that the entire corporation should be
barred.
   The strangest consequence of all, though, may stem from a
recommendation that some midlevel Air Force officials are now
passing up the chain of command. They want Northrop to
replace the DC-200 fluid in every air-launched cruise
missile. The company has balked, arguing that although there
are lots of fluids on the market that can better withstand
cold, such a switch might force other, more complex changes
to the missile.
   The Air Force, after long dancing around the problem, has
told the General Accounting Office that the move could cost
as little as $10 million.
