   Raychem Corp., Menlo Park, Calif., continuing to suffer
because of declining defense spending, said it had a loss in
the fiscal fourth quarter of $13.6 million, or 38 cents a
share.
   Raychem had net income of $13 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales in this year's quarter, ended
June 30, slipped about 2% to $295 million from $300.8
million. The quarterly loss swelled Raychem's loss for the
fiscal year to $111.4 million, or $3.12 a share, compared
with year-earlier profit of $36.3 million, or $1.04 a share.
This year's loss included a $90 million charge from
restructuring and divestitures in the fiscal third quarter.

   The aerospace and electronics concern said sales for the
year totaled $1.1 billion, up 3% from $1.08 billion the year
before.
   Robert J. Saldich, president and chief executive officer,
called the fourth-quarter results "disappointing" and said
the company has yet to see much positive impact from the
restructuring moves. However, he said he expects results to
improve gradually in fiscal 1991.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Raychem closed at
$26.375, down $1.875.
