   NEW YORK -- David Marcus, an executive vice president at
the New York Stock Exchange, soon will oversee Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.'s legal and compliance departments.
   He also will be a senior executive vice president and a
member of the firm's executive committee, reporting to Howard
L. Clark Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Marcus succeeds David Hershberg, who resigned after
six years as general counsel. Mr. Hershberg's political base
within the firm decayed when Peter Cohen, Shearson's former
chairman, was ousted in January. Mr. Hershberg will remain
until Mr. Marcus joins the firm Sept. 4.
   At the Big Board, Mr. Marcus handled relations with
institutional investors and international regulatory
organizations, among others. He joined the exchange in 1982
from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., where he was counsel,
secretary and senior vice president for 13 years. Previously,
Mr. Marcus was branch chief and enforcement attorney at the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
