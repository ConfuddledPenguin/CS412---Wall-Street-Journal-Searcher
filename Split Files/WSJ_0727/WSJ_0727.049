   TOKYO -- Production at Japan's mines and factories grew
2.7% in June from a year earlier while showing a 0.4% drop
from the previous month, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry said.
   The industrial and mining production index before seasonal
adjustment stood at 127.6, while the adjusted index was 124.5
(1985 equals 100).

   Despite the month-to-month drop, ministry officials said
industrial production as a whole, reflecting the country's
sustained economic growth, still remains strong.
