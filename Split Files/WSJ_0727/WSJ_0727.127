   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. -- Knogo Corp. said it plans to repurchase
as much as $1 million of its common shares in open market
transactions.
   At May 31, the maker of retail anti-theft systems, had 5.3
million shares outstanding. The company said the current
stock price doesn't reflect its "prospects and represents an
excellent long-term investment."
