   The am/pm International subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield
Co. of Los Angeles said it signed a joint venture and
licensing agreement with a Thai investor group to open more
than 500 am/pm convenience stores in Thailand over the next
10 years.
   The new joint venture company, am/pm Thailand Ltd., will
be 80% owned by the investor group and 20% by am/pm
International. The investor group includes Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank, BanChang Ban Pala Group, and Richard Ellis
real estate of Thailand. Several Thai managers will be
trained by am/pm International in Los Angeles. The Thai
stores will feature Western-style fast food, as well as local
fast food such as noodles flavored with chicken, pork and
fishballs.
