   BOSTON -- Boston Edison Co., citing higher operating
costs, reported a loss for the second quarter of about $2
million, or 17 cents a share.
   The latest quarter's loss compared with a year-earlier
earnings of $1.1 million, which, after preferred stock
dividends, was equal to a loss of 9 cents a share. Revenue
fell about 4.6% to $269.7 million from $282.7 million.

   A spokesman for the utility said that Boston Edison's
revenue isn't growing "as fast as expected" and thus didn't
keep pace in the latest quarter with operating and
maintenance expenses.
   He added that while electricity sales increased by 0.6%
during the quarter, customer "fuel-charge" revenue dropped.
The revenue is based on how much replacement power Boston
Edison purchases from outside utilities, he explained. Those
purchases were lower in the latest quarter than last year,
largely because the company's Pilgrim nuclear power plant has
been operating at full capacity this year.
   For the six months, the utility earned $28.5 million, or
51 cents a share, after an accounting change that added 41
cents a share to the company's profit. The change consists of
recording unbilled estimated revenue, which "provides a
better matching of revenue and expenses," the company said.
In the year-earlier six months, the company earned $12.9
million, or 11 cents a share. Revenue rose slightly to $579.3
million from $579 million.
