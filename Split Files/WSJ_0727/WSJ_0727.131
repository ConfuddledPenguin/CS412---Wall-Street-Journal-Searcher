   National Power PLC reported a #605 million ($1.09 billion)
loss for the year ended March 31.
   The company is the larger of the two British electricity
generating companies getting ready for privatization. The
results were given as if National Power had been an
autonomous business throughout the year. The company was
created by the British government March 31 as part of a plan
for restructuring and selling the electricity supply
industry.

   National Power shares will be offered to the public in
February.
   In the year, National Power had operating profit of #456
million on sales of #4 billion. Year-earlier figures weren't
given.
   National Power said the loss for exceptional and
extraordinary items was #914 million, mainly in connection
with costs associated with a restructuring ahead of the sale
and the revaluation of the company's coal stocks.
   National Power also said 5,000 jobs will be cut over the
next five years.
