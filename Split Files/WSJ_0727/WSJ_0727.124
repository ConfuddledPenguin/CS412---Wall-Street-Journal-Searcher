   WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee
voted to reimpose rate regulation on basic cable-television
service.
   The measure, which also contains provisions that would
benefit fledgling competitors of cable, passed on a voice
vote with no dissent.

   The impetus for such a measure has been sizable increases
in monthly cable fees since rates were largely deregulated 3
1/2 years ago. In some cases, rates have doubled or tripled,
although increases have been moderating in recent months.
   The National Cable Television Association said it was
"very troubled by the bill and does not support it." Among
other things, NCTA President James Mooney cited the bill's
"preoccupation with holding rates down." Still, the prospect
of cable legislation passing both houses this year has
improved, especially now that telephone companies essentially
have lost their bid to enter the cable business this year.
   The bill calls for the Federal Communications Commission
to establish a maximum fee that cable operators could charge
for a basic tier of cable service consisting of broadcast
signals carried by cable companies and public education and
government channels.
   Fees for other channels carried by cable would be
regulated on a case-by-case basis when authorities suspect
price gouging. The FCC would develop criteria to identify
abusive or unreasonable rates, and states or local cable
franchising authorities would alert the FCC about rate
increases that appeared unreasonable or abusive. Under the
bill, the FCC could review and roll back the recent flurry of
cable rate increases and "re-tiering" -- repacking channels
in a way to boost revenues.
   In a major step to help emerging competitors to cable,
such as so-called wireless cable and direct broadcast
satellite, the legislation calls for cable programmers that
are owned wholly or in part by cable operators to sell
programming to cable competitors. Specifically, it bars
programmers with ties to cable operators from unreasonably
refusing to sell programming to cable competitors, although
it recognizes exclusive arrangements that don't hurt
competition as a legitimate business strategy.
   The measure also would require the FCC to develop
customer-service standards that would be monitored by local
authorities.
   Cable interests were buoyed when a long-shot effort by
telephone companies to drum up votes to allow them into the
cable business flopped, pushing the issue back at least until
next year. "After all the smoke and noise," Mr. Mooney said,
"telco-TV didn't have the votes." Phone companies argue that
they must be permitted to provide video entertainment
services to pay for the additional expenses of updating their
networks with optical fiber.
   Also yesterday, the FCC released a summary of its
long-awaited report to Congress on the cable industry. It
recommended a series of steps to encourage competitors, but
said it didn't endorse reregulation of rates or service. The
FCC didn't address the matter of allowing phone companies
into the cable business but is handling that issue in a
separate proceeding.
   The report isn't likely to have a huge impact on Capitol
Hill. The essence of some of the key recommendations is
already contained in the legislation that has passed both the
Senate and House Commerce panels. An example is requiring
vertically integrated cable companies to sell programming to
competitors but recognizing exclusive arrangements as a sound
business strategy. Besides, major amendments on the floor,
especially efforts to ditch rate reregulation, could torpedo
the whole effort.
   In the 10-page summary, the commission recommended that
Congress bar local franchising authorities from unreasonably
keeping out new cable competitors. It also said that Congress
should limit local governments' regulation of the
installation of multi-channel video reception equipment to
"clearly defined health, safety or reasonable aesthetic
objectives."
   It also recommended must-carry provisions requiring cable
companies to carry local broadcasters, and restricting
changes in channel assignments so that cable operators
couldn't bounce around broadcast stations on the dial.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, predicted the FCC report would have
little influence on current legislation. He applauded the
House committee's bill, saying he was particularly pleased
with language that strengthens consumer protections over
repackaging cable service, specific regulation over
remote-control devices and converter boxes, and an expanded
provision directing the FCC to look for backdoor rate
increases.
   Some lawmakers, however, are concerned that both the House
and Senate legislation include too few consumer protections
and generally do little to help competitors, serving mostly
to entrench cable as a monopoly. Rep. Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.),
a strong critic of the reregulation effort, said "I hope we
are able to have future cable bills -- beginning next year."
