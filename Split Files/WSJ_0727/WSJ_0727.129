   NEW YORK -- A late round of selling pushed stock prices
lower, with tobacco issues pacing the retreat as the market
reacted to an adverse court ruling.
   Many investors sat out the session, traders said, to await
a report due this morning on the economy's second-quarter
performance. As a result, trading was moderate and the
pattern of slowing activity since Monday's sharp downturn
remained intact.

   In the aftermath of that sell-off, "people are still
looking over their shoulders," said Richard Meyer, head of
institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. He added:
"There are so many crosscurrents in the marketplace that
people can't seem to get a handle on where things are going."
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10.15 points lower
at 2920.79 after bouncing off the 2900 level late in the
session. The recovery took place after the average tumbled
more than 30 points in about 20 minutes amid flurries of
futures-related program selling.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 155,040,000
shares, down from 163,530,000 Wednesday. By comparison, Big
Board trading Monday amounted to 209 million shares.
   Declining issues topped advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 778 to 701 in the latest session. Among broader
market indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped
1.18 to 355.91, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
fell 0.55 to 194.55 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
declined 1.05 to 330.19.
   A ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court that warnings
placed on cigarette packs don't provide tobacco companies
with immunity from product-liability lawsuits -- a stance at
odds with previous federal rulings -- touched off a wave of
selling in tobacco stocks.
   Philip Morris fell 1 3/4 to 47 1/4 on Big Board composite
trading of 3.2 million shares, ranking second to Citicorp on
the list of most-active Big Board issues. Citicorp dropped
1/8 to 20 7/8 on more than five million shares, as
dividend-related trades swelled volume in the bank holding
company's stock.
   Among other tobacco issues, American Brands skidded 3 3/8
to 66 1/4 and Loews, the owner of Lorillard, dropped 2 1/4 to
105 1/2 on the Big Board. B.A.T Industries, the parent
company of Brown &amp; Williamson, went down 1/8 to 10 7/8 in
American Stock Exchange trading.
   Data on second-quarter gross national product are expected
to show that the economy expanded at a 1.8% annual rate,
about even with the first quarter's 1.9% rate, according to
the consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital
Markets Report.
   "People are kind of holding back on doing anything," said
Joseph J. McAlinden, director of research at Dillon, Read &amp;
Co. "In part, people are waiting to see what the GNP number
looks like."
   Analysts also expect two GNP-based measures of inflation
to receive close scrutiny from the market, as inflation
worries have resurfaced lately amid speculation that the
Federal Reserve might be placing less of an emphasis on
keeping inflation under control.
   News that congressional budget negotiators have abandoned
any hope of forging a compromise deficit-reduction plan
before the August recess also received a cool response from
the market. In light of that setback, efforts to bring the
deficit under control are likely to produce "a grand failure,
rather than a grand compromise," said Robert S. Robbins, a
technical analyst and market strategist at Robinson-Humphrey,
Atlanta.
   Du Pont and Merck, the latest players in the
pharmaceutical industry to join forces, both moved higher in
the wake of their agreement. Du Pont rose 1 1/2 to 40 7/8 on
Big Board composite volume of 1.5 million shares, while Merck
gained 7/8 to 89 7/8; the companies will jointly own Du
Pont's entire drug business.
   Upjohn, rumored as another drug-industry merger candidate,
climbed 5/8 to 43 1/2 on 1.8 million shares. Other advancers
in the sector included Pfizer, up 7/8 to 74 1/8, and Syntex,
up 5/8 to 61 5/8.
   But Eli Lilly, whose anti-depressant drug Prozac has been
accused of inspiring suicidal thoughts in some of its users,
fell 4 3/8 to 79 5/8 on 1.7 million shares. The widows of
three men killed in September 1989 at a Kentucky printing
plant filed a wrongful-death suit against Lilly, charging
that the man who was responsible for the shootings was
undergoing treatment with Prozac at the time.
   Oil issues continued to lose ground after rallying
Tuesday. Exxon dropped 3/4 to 48 7/8, Chevron fell 3/4 to 77,
Texaco declined 1/2 to 61 3/4 and Mobil slipped 1 to 65;
within the oil field-services sector, Schlumberger fell 7/8
to 64 1/8 and Halliburton lost 3/4 to 52 1/2.
   PepsiCo climbed 1 3/8 to 79 3/4. The company declared a
3-for-1 stock split.
   On the earnings front, Compaq Computer dropped 1 1/2 to 57
7/8 on 2.1 million shares. Although its second-quarter net
income went up 24% from a year ago and appeared to be in line
with analysts' projections, the company noted that its U.S.
sales rose just 2%.
   Bethlehem Steel, which reported a 74% decline in
second-quarter net, dropped 3/4 to 15 1/4. Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber declined 7/8 to 27 1/4; the company posted an
operating loss of $10 million for the quarter, compared with
a year-ago operating profit of $22.2 million.
   Imperial Chemical Industries retreated 4 1/4 to 74 3/4.
Pretax profit at the British company dropped 21% in the first
half from the year-earlier level; the latest results also
fell short of analysts' forecasts.
   Other targets of earnings-related selling included Data
General, which fell 1 to 7 7/8, and Raychem, which skidded 1
7/8 to 26 3/8. On the other hand, Black &amp; Decker advanced 7/8
to 15 7/8, Service Corp. International rose 1 to 19 1/8 and
Unum gained 1/2 to 53 1/2 after issuing their quarterly
reports.
   Panhandle Eastern finished unchanged at 17 7/8 on 2.3
million shares. The company cut its quarterly dividend by
60%, to 20 cents a share, after reporting a second-quarter
loss of $13.6 million.
   Penn Central gained 1 5/8 to 25 on 1.7 million shares. The
company disclosed plans to buy back as many as six million
shares, about 9.6% of its shares outstanding, for $26 each.
   Merrill Lynch lowered its investment ratings on Caesars
World, which lost 1 to 16 1/8, and Circus Circus Enterprises,
which fell 2 1/2 to 65 3/4. The firm also lowered fiscal 1990
and 1991 earnings projections on Caesars.
   Scott Paper rose 1 3/4 to 50 1/8 after Dean Witter
Reynolds began its coverage of the stock with a buy
recommendation. Analyst Evanda Lynn told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report she views Scott as the "most
attractive paper industry investment at the current time."
   Eldon Industries, which said it is considering its
possible sale or merger along with other alternatives, added
1 5/8 to 17 7/8. The company also said it has hired a
financial adviser, which wasn't identified.
   MNC Financial slid 1 to 10. The company has tentatively
arranged for a capital infusion of at least $200 million from
an investor group, and J.P. Morgan is trying to put together
a $1 billion credit line.
   Norwest fell 7/8 to 19 1/2 after agreeing to acquire
United Banks of Colorado in a stock swap. The company will
exchange 1.22 common shares for each share of United Banks,
which rose 1 3/8 to 21 1/8 in over-the-counter trading.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index eased 0.62
to 356.33. Volume totaled 13,100,000 shares.
   Nichols Institute, the most-active issue in Amex trading,
gained 5/8 to 17 1/4 following the completion of an offering
of 1,770,000 common shares at $16.625 apiece.
