   COPIAGUE, N.Y. -- Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. said it is
recalling four drug products that accounted for about 5% of
its sales and about 16% of income before taxes and
extraordinary items in 1989.
   The generic drug company, which in February stopped
selling all but about four or five products while it
continues to conduct an audit of its products, also said it
elected to stop manufacturing 14 additional drug products for
economic reasons.

   Bolar said the products it was recalling aren't currently
being sold. Last year, before the company began recalling and
reviewing its products, Bolar had a line of more than 70
products.
   The recalls Bolar announced resulted from the audit
process. Bolar also said it was starting to submit
applications to the Food and Drug Administration for
reapproval of some drugs, which it didn't name, following the
audit.
   The FDA in March withdrew approval of Bolar's generic
version of Dyazide, a blood-pressure medicine. Bolar recalled
that drug in February as evidence mounted Bolar had passed
off brand-name drugs as its own to the FDA.
   Bolar said three of the products it is recalling are
pharmaceutical; their recall results from the company's
determination that the drugs weren't manufactured in
accordance with FDA approvals, or that Bolar's records don't
accurately reflect the composition or processes by which the
drugs or batches of them were manufactured.
   The fourth recall comes as a result of Bolar's
determination that test results on the drug, which were
necessary for FDA approval, can't be considered reliable.
Bolar said it had information indicating that the
Bolar-imprinted capsules may have contained material
manufactured by the brand name company to which the Bolar
version was compared.
