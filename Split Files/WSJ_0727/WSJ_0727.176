   SEDONA, Ariz. -- RMED International Inc. expects to report
profit of $90,000, or two cents a share, for the third
quarter ended June 30.
   Barry Plaga, chief financial officer, said the result is
primarily attributable to the sale of a 50% interest in a
flushable-diaper patent to a Canadian investment firm in June
for $225,000. A year ago, the company had a loss of $415,562,
or 12 cents a share.

   However, RMED conceded it is having problems bringing the
flushable diaper to market. In March, the company said the
diaper would be in production in May, but Edward Reiss,
chairman and president, said RMED couldn't find anyone to
make the diaper machine. The company is now building one from
"parts of old parts," a process that will take a few more
months, Mr. Reiss said.
   Messrs. Plaga and Reiss said they expect revenue to drop
sharply this year because three new competitors have entered
the biodegradable-diaper market. RMED's TenderCare diapers,
which the company claims decompose in landfills, had been its
core product, but "we lost the momentum," Mr. Reiss said.
   In the year ending Sept. 30, Mr. Plaga expects a loss of
$510,000, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of $1.9 million to
$2 million. Last year, RMED had a loss of $1.6 million, or 48
cents a share, on revenue of $3.3 million.
   Mr. Reiss said consumer skepticism about products called
"biodegradable" also hurt sales. In March, for instance,
environmentalists specifically denounced TenderCare diapers,
charging that they don't truly break down in landfills.
   In response to such criticism, Mr. Reiss said RMED is
shifting advertising emphasis to stress that TenderCare
diapers have fewer chemicals than competitors'.
