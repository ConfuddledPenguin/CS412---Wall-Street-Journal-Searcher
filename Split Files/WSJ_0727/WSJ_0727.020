   CHICAGO -- Amoco Corp. said it will spend more than $200
million over the next four years to expand the capacity of
its Alvin, Texas, olefins plant.
   The energy concern said the expansion will increase annual
ethylene output at the facility by about 600 million pounds
from over two billion pounds presently, and will increase
propylene production capacity by 200 pounds, from current
annual levels of about 800 million pounds.
