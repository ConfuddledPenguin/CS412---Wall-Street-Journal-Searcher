   Unionized workers at Alcan Aluminium Ltd.'s smelter in
Kitimat, British Columbia, approved a revised three-year
contract proposal, ending a strike that began at midnight PDT
Monday.
   The revised accord, which follows a proposal that was
rejected Wednesday, calls for annual wage increases of 6%, an
immediate signing bonus of 1,750 Canadian dollars (US$1,517)
per worker, and inflation-indexed payments in the second and
third years of the pact, Alcan's spokesman said.

   The Montreal-based aluminum maker's original offer also
provided for 6% annual wage increases, though the signing
bonus was C$250 less for each worker, and inflation-indexed
payments were to occur only in the third year of the pact.
   The Kitimat smelter, which produces about 260,000 metric
tons of aluminum ingots annually, accounts for about 18% of
Alcan's total primary aluminum capacity. It is expected to
lose only minimal output as a result of the short strike,
Alcan's spokesman said.
   Management workers have kept most of the smelter running
normally since the strike by 1,600 members of the Canadian
Association of Smelter and Allied Workers began.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Alcan closed at $23.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.
