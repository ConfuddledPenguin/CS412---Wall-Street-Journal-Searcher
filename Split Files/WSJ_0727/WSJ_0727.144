   NEW YORK -- The bond market barely budged during a
listless trading session yesterday as most prices ended
unchanged or slightly lower.
   "The bond market is moribund," said Christopher Rupkey, a
financial economist at Mitsubishi Bank.

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended unchanged
while prices of short-term and intermediate-term securities
ended just 1/16 point lower, a loss of less than 63 cents for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The yield on the benchmark
30-year bond stood firm at 8.54%.
   Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president at Tokai Bank
Ltd., attributed the sparse activity largely to investor
caution ahead of this morning's release of second-quarter
gross national product.
   "People don't want to stick their necks out," ahead of
potentially market-moving economic data, he said.
   Investors and bond traders will be scrutinizing the GNP
data for further signs that the economy is weakening
following the unexpected 3.2% decline in June durable goods
reported on Wednesday.
   Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
expect, on average, that inflation-adjusted GNP advanced at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8% in the latest
quarter, down marginally from 1.9% in the first quarter.
   Among other things, the GNP data are expected to reflect
sluggish sales. If that proves true, bond market players will
try to determine whether the slow sales are a correction to
the robust sales in the first quarter, or a sign of a
weakening economy.
   Dealers said bond-market players focused on the GNP report
because there was little else to discuss.
   The only other point of interest, they said, were reports
suggesting that there won't be quick progress on the federal
budget-reduction talks. The reports caused a minor flurry of
selling in the cash market after bond futures had finished at
their session peaks.
   The budget-summit negotiators had hoped to reach an
agreement before the Congressional summer recess, which
begins Aug. 3. But congressional and administration officials
now say a compromise may not be reached until Oct. 1, the
beginning of fiscal 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
102 5/32 to yield 8.54%, unchanged from Wednesday. New
two-year notes ended slightly lower at 99 26/32 to yield
8.09% compared with 99 28/ 32 to yield 8.07% on Wednesday.
   Treasury bills were slightly higher. The discount rate on
six-month bills rose to 7.58% for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.81% while the rate on six-month bills inched up to 7.47% to
yield 7.85%.
   The Treasury sold a record-size $10.5 billion of 52-week
bills yesterday at an average rate of 7.34%. The average rate
was down from an average rate of 7.52% at the previous
52-week bill auction held June 28. Yesterday's rate was the
lowest since 7.21% at the Jan. 11 auction.
   Here are details of yesterday's 52-week bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   The bills are dated August 2 and mature August 1, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds ended weaker in heavy selling as
comments by Bank of Japan officials reinforced perceptions
that interest rates will be moving higher.
   The selling reversed the market's advance of the previous
day and lifted the yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond to
a new six-year high of 7.505%. Meanwhile, officials at
Japan's long-term credit banks, which reset their prime
lending rate at the end of each month, said it is highly
likely that they will set the rate at 7.9% next week, up from
its current level of 7.6%.
   Bond prices started to fall after Bank of Japan Governor
Yasushi Mieno said that price stability is the central bank's
highest concern. Speaking at a private forum in Tokyo
Thursday afternoon, Mr. Mieno noted that Japan is facing an
acute labor shortage and that money supply growth is very
high, factors that could cause prices to rise quickly, he
warned.
   His remarks were taken as an indication that the central
bank is disposed to guide interest rates higher to reduce
inflationary pressures.
   On top of that, another Bank of Japan official suggested
that the central bank may be forced to slow the economy in an
effort to slow money supply growth. That was interpreted as a
indication that the Bank of Japan is willing to guide
interest rates higher even at the risk of reducing business
activity.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was quoted at a price
of 85.79, down 0.21 point, to yield 7.46%. In interdealer
trading after the exchange's close the yield rose to 7.505%.
(When calculated using the semiannual compound method, the
yield was 6.97%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   West German, British and other major foreign bond markets
were somewhat quiet yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. gave back early gains
to close sharply lower on news of an adverse court ruling
against the company and the tobacco industry.
   The New Jersey state Supreme Court ruled yesterday that
warnings on cigarette packs don't protect tobacco companies
from liability suits. That was a major setback for RJR and
two other cigarette makers named in a 1982 lawsuit.
   The news not only sent RJR bonds lower but dragged down
the broader junk bond market, which finished unchanged to
modestly lower. Junk bonds are speculative-grade issues with
low ratings or no ratings at all. In early trading, most junk
bonds had posted gains.
   RJR's 17 3/8% convertible payment-in-kind debentures
finished down 2 1/4 points to close at 115 3/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The company's 17% exchangeable
payment-in-kind debentures ended 1 3/4 points lower to close
at 92 3/4. Payment-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of
additional securities instead of cash.
   RJR's cash-paying 13.5% subordinated debentures fell 1 1/4
points to 100.
   The junk bonds of casinos operated by real estate
developer Donald Trump were also battered. The bonds slid on
a report, which appeared in this newspaper on Thursday, that
Mr. Trump may ask bondholders to accept equity in his casinos
in exchange for letting him cancel some interest payments.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first mortgage bonds
fell 1 1/2 points to 46 1/2.
   Trump Castle Funding Corp.'s 13 3/4% first mortgage bonds
fell three points to 55 while Trump Plaza's 12 7/8% first
mortgage bonds were down one point to 83.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended a lackluster session with slight
price gains.
   In the primary market, pricing details of just one sizable
offering were unveiled -- a $700 million First Chicago Master
Trust II 1990-B issue backed by credit-card receivables
issued and serviced by FCC National Bank, a unit of First
Chicago Corp.
   The new securities have a coupon rate of 8 7/8% and a
yield of 8.907%. The amount of the offering was an increase
from the expected $500 million.
   Lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. had no comment on
investor response to the deal, but market players said the
increase in size and post-pricing indications reflect strong
investor demand.
   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99 23/32, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99 2/32
and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were up
2/32 at 99 18/32.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher in
light trading.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/4 point
higher at 99 5/8 to yield 7.22%.
   A lack of supply is keeping municipal prices firm, traders
said.
   In new issue dealings, a Lazard Freres &amp; Co. Inc. group
repriced $61 million of New York State Dormitory special act
school districts revenue bonds to lower some yields by two to
five basis points.
   The issue is priced to yield from 6.10% in 1993 to 7.17%
in 2013.
   No large competitive issues were priced yesterday.
