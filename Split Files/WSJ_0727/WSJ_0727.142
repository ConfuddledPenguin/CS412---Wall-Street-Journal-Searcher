   A federal bankruptcy judge in Cincinnati approved an
asset-backed commercial-paper program for Allied Stores
Corp., a retailing unit of Campeau Corp.
   Allied's three-year agreement with Chemical Bank, a
subsidiary of Chemical Banking Corp., initially calls for
$650 million in financing but can be increased to $721
million. The financing will be securitized by Allied
receivables. A spokeswoman for Chemical said this will be the
first time a company in Chapter 11 proceedings has been able
to access the commercial-paper market.

   Mason Funding Corp., a special-purpose corporation, will
issue the commercial paper. The spokeswoman for Chemical,
which structured the deal, said the first issuance is
expected early next week.
   The receivables financing will replace a $700 million
Citibank financing that expires next week.
   Allied and Federated Department Stores Inc., another
Campeau unit, filed for bankruptcy-court protection in
January.
