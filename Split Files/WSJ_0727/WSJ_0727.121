   Norwest Corp. definitively agreed to acquire United Banks
of Colorado Inc. in a stock swap that, based on yesterday's
closing prices, values the Denver concern at about $23.79 a
share, or $420 million.
   The planned acquisition will provide expansion-minded
Norwest, a Minneapolis bank holding company, with its first
entry into the Colorado banking market.

   Norwest wants to exploit its marketing muscle in the
state, which opens to nationwide interstate banking in
January. The lowering of those barriers, Norwest said,
"offers many opportunities," which "will continue to increase
as the Colorado economy gains strength."
   Still, the bank it is acquiring is saddled with
significant problem loans, and the price being offered
represents a discount to what stronger regional banks bring.
   Under terms proposed, United Banks holders will receive
1.22 Norwest common shares in exchange for each of their
common shares. The total value of the proposed deal includes
United Banks warrants convertible into 1.6 million shares, as
well as $30 million in cash payments for United's preferred
stock outstanding.
   To add Colorado's largest commercial banking concern to
its stable of companies, Norwest will thus issue about 20
million new shares, representing a 16.3% stake.
   Norwest has assets of $26.8 billion; United Banks' assets
total $6.27 billion.
   United Banks, like its competitors in the state, has been
hurt by the downturn in the energy sector, and the subsequent
erosion of the region's real-estate market.
   Yesterday's merger announcement didn't come as a big
surprise: United Banks disclosed in April that it was holding
discussions with various out-of-state banks, including
Norwest. Earlier this month Norwest and the Denver concern
disclosed they were in formal talks over a possible
acquisition.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, United
Banks shares climbed $1.375 to close at $21.125. Norwest
shares slipped 87.5 cents in composite New York Stock
Exchange trading, to $19.50.
   The agreement is subject to approval both by regulators
and United Banks shareholders.
   Also, United Banks posted second-quarter results, which
included a special $95 million provision to cover loan losses
and write-down of some real estate holdings. The move gave it
a loss of $89.7 million, or $5.86 a share, for the latest
period.
   That trimmed its book value, or shareholder equity, to
$20.51 a share. The indicated $23.79-a-share the agreement
calls for represents only a modest premium to that; healthy
regional banks usually bring two times book value or more.
   United Banks' housecleaning isn't over yet. "Pursuant to
the merger agreement," it said yesterday, it expects to make
further provisions of up to another $95 million, which would
include merger-related expenses, in order to align United
"more closely with Norwest's accounting and credit
standards."
