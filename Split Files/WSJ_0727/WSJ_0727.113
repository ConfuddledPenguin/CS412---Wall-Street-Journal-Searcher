   WALTHAM, Mass. -- Cabot Corp. expects to report that
earnings rose about 57% in its fiscal third quarter, ended
June 30, because of its improving energy business,
cost-cutting measures and other factors, Samuel Bodman,
chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   In an interview, Mr. Bodman said fiscal third-quarter
profit was about $15 million, or 62 cents a share, compared
with $9.6 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
fell about 11% to $420 million from $470.5 million.

   For the nine months, indicated profit was about $59.7
million, or $2.36 a share, down 2.8% from $61.4 million, or
$2.23 a share, a year earlier. Indicated sales fell about 15%
to $1.27 billion from $1.49 billion.
   Mr. Bodman said the specialty-chemical and energy concern
has almost completed major changes he initiated after being
named chief executive about three years ago. Among other
things, Cabot has consolidated and spun off part of its
energy business, sold its West Texas gas-processing
facilities, invested heavily to refurbish chemicals plants,
and molded its bankrupt liquified-natural-gas operations into
a profitable business.
   Of Cabot's 23 top officers, 20 have been replaced.
Additionally, said Mr. Bodman, "we've taken as much cost out
of this company as we could" by such moves as selling Cabot's
airplane and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Cabot has
restructured its energy side as a "portfolio of investments"
partly run by outsiders, added Mr. Bodman, who was trained as
a chemical engineer and was formerly an executive at Fidelity
Investments.
   Mr. Bodman said some costly problems he "inherited" with
environmental cleanups and unfavorable "take-or-pay"
contracts for natural-gas distribution have now "been dealt
with." The problems necessitated spending about $115 million
over the past three years for additions to reserves to cover
expected liabilities, he added.
   Cabot's improved earnings have been achieved despite
"pretty tough conditions" in the market for its main chemical
product, carbon black, said Mr. Bodman. The substance is a
petroleum derivative used to strengthen tires and in making
other products. Cabot also makes noise-damping polymers,
plastics ingredients and fumed silica, which is used in
making silicone rubber.
   Recently there have been signs of lessening demand for
carbon black in Europe, although prices there remain strong,
he said. Cabot also is facing stiffer competition in the
relatively fast-growing markets for "specialty" blacks used
in inks, plastics and other products. Mr. Bodman added that
Cabot is responding by investing in new technology for carbon
black and other chemicals, and bringing out new products,
such as improved newsprint inks that don't rub off on
readers' hands.
   Cabot's energy business, which contributes more than half
of its revenue but only about 15% of its operating profit, is
on the upswing, Mr. Bodman said. The company's
liquified-natural-gas business, which imports Algerian gas
through a Boston terminal, should have operating profit of
about $10 million in fiscal 1990 after breaking even the
previous year, he added. The business, which is "like having
a {natural gas} well in Boston harbor," should grow as a
centrally placed supplier of relatively low-polluting fuel to
the energy-poor Northeast, Mr. Bodman said.
   The company's energy business also stands to gain from its
large reserves of natural gas and low finding costs for the
fuel, Mr. Bodman said. Total proven and developed gas
reserves totaled 533 billion cubic feet at the end of fiscal
1989. Most of Cabot's reserves are in relatively shallow gas
formations in Appalachia, making them cheap to reach compared
with most competitors' gas, he said.
   Mr. Bodman said Cabot expects capital expenditures of
about $170 million in fiscal 1990, lower than the $200
million projected earlier. He explained that the company has
slowed its plant-refurbishing spending while working out more
efficient ways to achieve the program's goals. Cabot's fiscal
1991 capital expenditures will probably be about the same as
the current fiscal year's spending, he said. Besides
modernizing old chemical plants, Cabot is building new ones
in the United Kingdom, China, Japan and other countries.
   Mr. Bodman said he is "comfortable with the low end" of
analysts' projected fiscal 1990 earnings of $2.75 to $3 a
share. "We'd like to believe Cabot can start to produce
earnings in line with what a company its size should make,"
he said. "But it's hard to forecast when our earnings are so
heavily dependent on gas prices," which are difficult to
predict.
