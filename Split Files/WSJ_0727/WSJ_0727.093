   The national real estate virus appears to be finally
taking hold in California, and that is giving bankers and
thrift executives all over the country the chills.
   California's gravity-defying economy in recent years has
made its real estate market the most robust in the country.
Lately, with New England, the Southwest and several other
regional markets in the tank, it has been about the only
robust one left. Big California banks and thrifts, as well as
many lenders across the nation who have heavy exposure to
California real estate, have been dreading the prospect of a
crack in California, which would leave them with practically
no good markets anywhere in the country.

   Fissures have now become evident. Yesterday Coast Savings
Financial Inc. reported a net loss of $28.7 million, or $1.89
a share, for the second quarter. The loss reflected increased
loan-loss reserves, primarily for bad assets outside
California but including some California problem assets too.
And Great American Bank FSB, as expected, reported a
second-quarter loss of $107.9 million, or $4.49 a share. Its
troubled assets ballooned to $1.8 billion from $929.2 million
as of March 31, in part because of a "slowdown" in California
real estate, Great American said.
   That comes on the heels of several recent disclosures by
financial institutions of mounting California woes. CalFed
Inc. cited deterioration in its California portfolio as the
main cause of its $53 million, or $2.10 a share,
second-quarter loss.
   HomeFed Inc., which reported a second-quarter loss of
$108.2 million, or $5.04 a share, said 37% of its problem
assets now are in California, a much higher percentage than
in years past.
   Banks have been feeling it too. First Interstate Bancorp,
trying to fight back from a string of surprise losses and
blunders that have badly weakened it over the past three
years, told analysts last week that its nonperforming real
estate loans would probably increase in the second half of
the year because of growing trouble in California real
estate.
   Such news has pounded financial institution stocks in
recent days. First Interstate, for example, skidded $2.25 a
share last Friday to a New York Stock Exchange close of
$34.75. It lost 13% of its market value in the two days after
the analysts' meeting. Yesterday, it closed at $34.75, down
25 cents.
   Also yesterday, Moody's Investor Service Inc. issued a
special report predicting softening in major sectors of the
California market over the next two years. It said
significant declines in asset value could appear by late this
year. Moody's recently lowered its debt ratings on San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific Corp., citing potential for such declines.
   "You can no longer be sanguine about the California real
estate situation," says Donald Crowley, an analyst with Keefe
Bruyette &amp; Woods. "It is not good news for lenders."
   California isn't on the verge of a Texas-style collapse;
its economy remains the most buoyant in the nation. But the
state has been suffering from a gradually worsening
commercial real estate glut for about two years that now is
beginning to produce some notable vacancy rates.
   In Los Angeles, for example, Mr. Crowley says, the office
vacancy rate is about 15%, with enough office space scheduled
to hit the market in the next few years to produce vacancy
rates of 20% to 25%. Orange County already has a vacancy rate
of 22%, up two to three percentage points in the past two
years. By comparison, Phoenix, at the epicenter of Arizona's
real estate tremors, has a vacancy rate of roughly 29%.
   Reflecting concern about the overbuilt commercial market,
Security Pacific's Jack Hancock, executive vice president of
the bank's real estate industries group, says Security
Pacific anticipates no significant growth in its $7 billion
commercial real estate portfolio.
   More worrisome, the residential market, heretofore
seemingly on a one-way ticket skyward, has crested. Home
prices, which in some areas of the state have doubled or
tripled in the 1980s, dropped statewide for the third month
in a row after five years of almost uninterrupted increases.
House resales in June fell to an annualized rate of 443,451,
their lowest level since 1986.
   Mr. Hancock says he believes this is "an aberration" and
that the housing market is still strong. Nonetheless, he
says, "Clearly, we have slowed down in California."
   Economic factors may further damp the market in coming
years, especially if defense spending continues to wind down.
About 8% of California's jobs are in the defense industry.
Recently, McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced its intention to
eliminate 14,000 to 17,000 jobs, mainly in Southern
California, because of reduced defense spending.
