   LVOV, U.S.S.R. -- Flea marketers in Moscow sell T-shirts
asking, "What have you done for perestroika today?"
   In this region of western Ukraine, the question doesn't
apply. Perestroika hasn't even arrived. Five years after
Mikhail Gorbachev came to power promising to restructure
Soviet society and its economy, residents of Lvov love his
glasnost, or openness, which has given them the freedom to
complain, among other things, that "you can't eat glasnost."

   A reporter's two-week visit to this region far from Moscow
offers snapshots of perestroika, 1990, in action, or, most
often, inaction. Here are a few of them:
   ---
   At the collective farms, factories and enterprises where
food and other goods are made and packaged for distribution,
some work must surely be going on. But finding evidence of it
isn't easy. Impromptu visits to factories and offices around
Lvov show a kind of perpetual recess.
   Nobody there. Nobody doing anything. This is a socialist
workers' paradise Lenin didn't envision. Having a job has
very little to do with having to work.
   Even in government offices, officials wait for Moscow's
next perestroika plan just as they did old five-year plans.
They complain of not having legal authority from Moscow to
revamp the local economy. Even if they did, they aren't sure
what they'd do or how they'd go about it. The Ukraine's
government in Kiev has declared the republic's sovereignty.
Officials here wait to see what that means.

   "Our economy is literally falling apart," says Stepan I.
Davimvka, a 43-year-old former aerospace engineer who is the
region's top economic manager.
   "The old command system of labor no longer works," he
says. "Discipline has fallen sharply at all levels, from
worker on up. There's been a sharp fall in output. We now
have no growth, and the tendency is for further decline."
   "New discipline must come from the worker himself," he
says. But he admits there's no incentive for that. Workers
get paid whether they work or not. They don't fear being
fired.

   A restaurant door is open at noon on a weekday, but inside
there's no sign of life. Eventually, a man emerges from the
kitchen to shoo his eager customers out. "Go away, we're
closed," he says. But hours posted on the door say otherwise,
he is told. "It's cleaning day," he shouts with a
you-must-be-deaf expression. "GO AWAY]" Cleaning days are an
institution here.
   Impromptu work-avoidance occurs whenever a rumor comes
along that something has arrived somewhere to buy. Workers
dash out of the offices and shops to get into line. Some wait
hours. Anytime after noon is a good time for men to pop away
from their desks for "500 mills," the standard milliliter
measure for a shot of vodka. Stores and shops are shuttered
for days at a time for "taking inventory," an especially
ironic exercise in a nation singularly lacking in
inventories.

   Viktor Pynzenyk says he knows how to make people work, and
quick: sell factories to their workers, shops to their
clerks, apartments to their occupants, and government and
Communist Party buildings to private companies. Allow hiring
and firing at will. Break down vertical supply lines with
Moscow. Set up horizontal economic ties to other regions,
thereby cutting out Moscow as socialist middleman.
   "The measures taken since 1987 were only attempts at
reform," says the 36-year-old university economics professor.
"They were half steps and many weren't fulfilled at all.
People now have a lack of faith in any steps the government
takes. They are frustrated and bitter."
   The Ukraine, he says, is a colony of Moscow. Its minerals,
land and labor are exploited. Less than 20% of the value of
what Lvov produces stays in Lvov. The rest goes to Moscow.
Intourist rakes off tourist revenue. With economic
sovereignty, he says, Ukrainians and Lvovians would have the
incentives and competition and resources to become rich. But
there's a hitch beyond Moscow's foot-dragging: Local people
say they want competition as long as they don't lose from it.
   "We're psychologically not ready for that step," he says.
"There's an old Ukrainian saying: Let me have not one cow as
long as my neighbor doesn't have two. In other words, let's
all be poor together. This must change. Competition and
inequities are the first element of a healthy economic
society but this population doesn't understand that."

   Indeed, over at the farmers' free market, customers heap
constant verbal abuse on farm women in babushkas raking in
rubles behind their small mountains of fresh produce.
   Like an oasis in this commercial desert, the market is a
dawn-to-dusk gridlock of buyers and sellers. It is piled with
strawberries, cherries, melons, apricots, peaches, plums,
oranges, homemade jams, fresh mushrooms, pickles, cucumbers,
tomatoes, dill, squash, beans, beets, spinach, lettuce,
homemade cheese, pork, poultry, fish and dozens of varieties
of flowers. Customers eagerly snap up the bounty. But are
they grateful? Perhaps, but they show it by calling the
farmers price-gouging peasants and thieves.
   The story is much the same at a flea market on the west
side of town. This is where locals buy car parts, blue jeans,
Western music cassettes, and clothes never available in state
shops. It, too, brims with customers and others who come
simply for the recreation of seeing what's new for sale. The
Communists, who ran this town until March, tolerated this
market. But some of the new democrats who now run Lvov say it
is a messy, disorderly, unregulated venue for crooks,
gypsies, border-hopping Poles and speculators. They want it
closed down.

   Back on main street, an enterprising Estonian wearing a
skin-tight imported shirt and a silver necklace has come to
Lvov to practice what Prof. Pynzenyk says it needs: commerce
between regions. He's brought 6,000 copies of a newspaper he
publishes in the Estonian capital of Tallinn to sell here.
   "Back in Tallinn I sell for one ruble, here more," he
says, rubbing his thumb and forefinger together. "Here I get
10 rubles, sometimes more." Local papers cost five kopecks,
or local cents.
   Young men in the crowd around him eagerly wave 10 ruble
notes, which have the buying power of $10 bills in America.
His publication is called Sunday Newspaper, and labeled "For
Family Reading." It's the paper's magazine insert the young
men want. "Estonian girls, 27 photos, young girls," says the
Estonian.
   "Such filth," shouts an old woman attracted by the crowd.
"Why do you sell this filth?"
   The Estonian says he'll buy things here to sell back in
Tallinn. He's on the lookout for Chinese condoms, which are a
bargain here at 1.05 rubles for three. "Back home I can sell
for five rubles," he says.
