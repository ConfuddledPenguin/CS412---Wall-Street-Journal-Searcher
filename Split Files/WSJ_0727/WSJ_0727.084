   Late-Summer Movies May Steal Thunder

   When Paramount Pictures Corp.'s "Ghost" opened two
weekends ago, the odds of success seemed slim at best. The
romantic thriller was entering a field glutted with big
movies ranging from "Total Recall" and "Die Hard II" to
"Another 48 Hours" and "Days of Thunder."
   But while many of those pricey, megastar movies are
dropping off precipitously, "Ghost" is turning out to be one
of the summer's surprise hits. After opening to an impressive
$12.2 million on about 1,100 screens, the movie added 300
more screens and sold $12.5 million of tickets last weekend.
It continued to gain momentum this week, with ticket sales at
about $38 million as of yesterday.

   In a summer packed with big-budget, big-star movies,
"Ghost" is the first widely released film to appeal to a
largely ignored audience of women and moviegoers tired of the
relentless diet of action films. Although its premise is a
variation on other similar themes recently, the story about a
man who is murdered but comes back as a ghost to save his
girlfriend and catch his killer is generating good word of
mouth, a key ingredient in any movie's success.
   A number of other movies starting today could well benefit
by filling the gap left by a dearth of intelligent adult
movies and comedies. For example, today Time Warner Inc.'s
Warner Bros. opens the much-publicized "Presumed Innocent,"
which stars Harrison Ford and is based on the best-selling
novel by Scott Turow, and MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios is
releasing "Problem Child," a comedy. Due to expand to more
theaters after a limited release in New York and Los Angeles
is Tri-Star's "The Freshman," a comedy that features Matthew
Broderick and Marlon Brando doing a takeoff of his
"Godfather" character.
   For the first part of the summer at least, "the industry
went off on a tangent," forgetting the audience of young
adults who last summer made hits out of movies like "When
Harry Met Sally" and "Parenthood," says Alan Kassan, who
follows the movie business for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "For a
while, the industry was doing a super job of changing its
product development to coincide with the demographic changes
of baby boomers replacing teenagers as the heavy moviegoing
group," he adds. "But this summer everyone wanted to have the
next `Batman.'"
   Unfortunately, it doesn't look like any of this summer's
action crop is going to even come close to the success of
Warner Bros.' "Batman," which took in more than $250 million
in the U.S. alone after opening last summer. The biggest hit
of the summer so far this year is "Total Recall," the Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie produced by Carolco Pictures Inc. and
distributed by Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star Pictures. That movie has
taken in about $110 million since opening at the beginning of
the summer, but it is dropping off sharply each weekend.
   After hitting a record $2.04 billion last year, the summer
box office is likely to drop 9% to $1.85 billion, even with
ticket price increases, says A.D. Murphy, who tracks
box-office data for Variety. Mr. Murphy says that is still
the second best summer on record -- and last year's results
were virtually impossible to duplicate, with three big
blockbusters: "Batman," "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"
and "Lethal Weapon II."
   John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which
gathers data for theater owners, agrees that the box-office
numbers, are "down, but still good." But he notes, "Last
year, you had a diversity of pictures, including big hits and
smaller pictures with good legs." This year, he adds, "you
don't have any of those elements" so far.
   While a handful of other summer action movies may break
the $100 million mark, that is no longer considered a big
success, particularly when movies cost $40 million to $60
million to produce and another $20 million to $30 million to
market. "Total Recall," for example, reportedly cost more
than $60 million, not including sizable marketing and
distribution costs. By contrast, "Ghost" cost only about $20
million to produce and features the relatively minor stars
Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg.
   Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette,
noted in a recent report: "In another age, Paramount's two
lead films, `Another 48 Hours' and `Days of Thunder,' which
combined will probably gross $150 million to $200 million,
would have been triumphs. But it probably cost around $100
million to make those movies, and in the light of the cost,
the returns so far are modestly disappointing."
   "Days of Thunder," which stars Tom Cruise, is on about
1,900 screens and "Another 48 Hours," which stars Eddie
Murphy, is down to 800 screens from its 2,200-screen opening
in early June. Barry London, president of distribution for
Paramount, notes, "The movies are both still in wide release,
and I don't think the final stories are in yet." But the
Paramount Communications Inc. unit did move up the release of
"Ghost," Mr. London acknowledges, "to take advantage of the
lack of programming for the female audience."
   Observers note it is still possible for movies to build
audiences if they can hold theaters. Walt Disney Co.'s
"Pretty Woman," which opened in early March, is the
highest-grossing movie so far this year. It has taken in $160
million at the box office; as of last weekend, the movie was
still pulling in $1.7 million at more than 1,000 theaters.
   And some movies that opened early in the summer have
quietly built into respectable successes, notably Universal's
"Bird on a Wire," which stars Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn.
Although the movie is only playing on about 589 screens, it
has taken in more than $66 million. Likewise, Universal's
"Back to the Future Part III," which opened Memorial Day
weekend, is still hanging in there. The movie is the No. 3
hit of the summer, with a total take of about $78.5 million;
it sold more than $1 million in tickets at 878 screens last
weekend.
   Both "Die Hard II," from News Corp.'s Twentieth Century
Fox Film Co., and "Dick Tracy," from Walt Disney, continue to
do strong business. "Dick Tracy" is clearly the bigger
success of the two so far in terms of total revenues, ranking
No. 2 after "Total Recall." The movie is just sliding past
the $100 million mark, and though estimates of its production
and marketing costs vary, analysts say Disney has a
profitable film on its hands, assuming the movie cost about
$32 million to produce. Studios' share of box-office revenues
typically range between 40% and 60%.
   "Die Hard II" will have to do better than the total as of
last week of $77 million, since the movie reportedly cost
more than $60 million to produce. But in terms of weekly
ticket sales, the movie is stronger than "Dick Tracy." Last
weekend, according to Baseline Inc., "Die Hard II" was the
No. 2 film in the market after "Ghost," selling $10 million
of tickets at 2,325 screens. "Dick Tracy," by contrast, was
the No. 8 film in the market, selling $3.1 million of tickets
at 1,642 screens, the entertainment data-gathering service
said.
   Some of the newer crop also show signs of promise.
Disney's "Arachnophobia," a black comedy about a town
infested with spiders, started off with a modest $1.2 million
opening night on Wednesday, July 18. Last Wednesday, the
movie took in $1.3 million, and its cumulative sales as of
yesterday were about $14.3 million. "When a picture goes up
that second week, there's no better sign that you may have a
hit," says Mr. Krier of Exhibitor Relations. The movie, now
on 1,479 screens, will go to an additional 370 screens this
weekend.
   "Arachnophobia" this weekend, however, will be going up
against "Presumed Innocent," "The Freshman," and "Problem
Child." And a number of other movies are slated for release
later in August. "There are 10 or 12 movies still to come
this summer, and the second half has quite a few quality
pictures left in it," says Philip Garfinkle, executive vice
president of Entertainment Data Inc.
   Mr. Garfinkle and other observers say comedies should do
well, since there have been virtually none this summer.
Warner's "My Blue Heaven," for example, features Steve Martin
as a convicted mobster who goes into the federal
witness-protection program in a small town. Other films
likely to draw a strong adult audience are Paramount's "The
Two Jakes," starring Jack Nicholson in a long-awaited sequel
to "Chinatown;" and "Air America," which stars Mel Gibson as
a fighter pilot.
