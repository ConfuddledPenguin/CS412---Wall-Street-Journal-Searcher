   Tokyo stock prices finished lower in thin dealings,
discouraged by fluctuations in the bond and foreign-exchange
markets.
   Meanwhile, London stocks finished significantly lower,
depressed by weaker-than-expected half-yearly earnings from
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, said to be the bellwether
of British industry.

   Sentiment in Tokyo was also hurt by reports that the
national tax agency decided to impose a total of about 7
billion yen ($46.7 million) in taxes on Japanese securities
companies that allegedly compensated major clients for losses
in 1987's Black Monday stock plunge.
   Yamaichi Securities and Daiwa Securities, who were named
in the news reports, officially denied them by midafternoon.
But securities companies shares failed to recover from the
fall.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues dropped 331.52 points to
31369.75. Volume on the first section was estimated at 330
million shares, down from 353 million shares Wednesday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 622 to 295, while 205 issues
were unchanged.
   In trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index was down
744.94 points to 30624.81 at the end of the morning session.
   On Thursday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed in the first section fell 26.11 points, or 1.13%, to
2281.20.
   The second section index added 3.54 points, or 0.08%, to
4384.30. Volume in the section was estimated at 22.9 million
shares, up from 21.2 million shares.
   The market softened in the early morning, responding to
the yen's weakness as the dollar climbed above 150 yen.
   The Nikkei Index firmed in the midmorning, however, helped
by minor index-linked buying by a few brokerage houses and
gains for high-price shares. But that was the only time in
the day the index moved upward.
   Wire news agencies reported late morning that more than 10
securities companies, including Yamaichi and Daiwa,
compensated a total of roughly 16 billion yen for their major
institutional and individual clients in 1987. The reports
said the tax agency decided the costs fell under
"entertainment expenses," subject to taxation.
   The stock futures market first slid responding to the
news, and then the cash market followed, as investors held
off from buying, observers said.
   The report prompted selling of securities companies
shares.
   As for the overall losses yesterday, traders blamed
already bearish sentiment, mirroring investors'
discouragement as they had been unable to see signs that
domestic interest rates may peak out soon.
   For the third consecutive day, Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone Corp. posted a record low, falling 20000 yen to 1
million yen.
   While the market's direction remains foggy, investors are
trying to take profits from stocks of companies whose
earnings are predicted to grow at faster paces than the
average on the market, a senior trader at Wako Securities
said. Also, smaller-capital shares are attracting most of
investors' interest as the stocks tend to move up widely on
small volume, he said.
   Investors, who had taken enough profits from small-capital
shares to offset losses on NTT, are dumping NTT stocks, he
said.
   The reports on tax investigation prompted selling of not
only Daiwa and Yamaichi, but of other brokerage house shares.
Daiwa Securities was down 40 yen to 1330 yen, Yamaichi
Securities dropped 60 yen to 1120 yen, Nomura Securities fell
50 yen to 2050 yen, and Nikko Securities declined 50 yen to
1120 yen.
   In London, traders blamed the drop in ICI shares for the
lower close.
   "ICI is the sole culprit" for the market's slide, one
dealer said. "The chemistry of the {ICI earnings} combined
with the market's recent twitchy mood made the entire market
volatile," he added. ICI, part of the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index, fell 65 pence to #10.40 ($1.18 to
$18.81), having been off as many as 77 pence at one point. A
hefty 7.6 million issues changed hands.
   In addition, the recent good progress in the oil sector
was abruptly halted, dealers said, putting further pressure
on the broader market.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index fell 20.6 points to 2344.1. The
Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped 14.2 points to 1851.5
points. Volume was a moderate 468.8 million shares, up from
427.5 million issues Wednesday.
   A soggy showing on Wall Street also hindered any headway
in London, dealers said, where oil stocks were also falling
back and several corporate earnings from the Big Three U.S.
car makers were disappointing.
   Other chemical shares felt the brunt of the ICI news,
dealers said. Courtaulds shed 10 pence to 369 pence, while
BOC slumped 12 pence to 573 pence.
   In the oil patch, Ultramar dropped 11 pence to 338 pence,
Enterprise shed 12 pence to 675 pence, Burmah eased 12 pence
to 658 pence, British Petroleum fell 4.5 pence to 338.5
pence, while Shell Transport &amp; Trading sank 9 pence to 479
pence. Dealers said the sector ran out of steam after its
hearty advance earlier in the week as investors took profits
ahead of news from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meeting in Geneva.
   STC, an electronics group, advanced 3 pence to 289 pence.
Dealers said the stock gained on hopes that the company will
include details of its talks with Fujitsu Ltd. over the
possible sale of its computer subsidiary ICL with the
half-year earnings results, set to be reported Monday.
   Banks were off ahead of the start of the interim reporting
season, as Lloyds kicks off the round today with its results.
Barclays fell 5 pence to 402 pence, Lloyds shed 4 pence to
298 pence, National Westminster slipped 4 pence to 333 pence,
while Midland eased 2 pence to 296 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Frankfurt, Stockholm
and Milan, mixed in Amsterdam and lower in Paris, Zurich,
Brussels and Madrid. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks ended down in Hong Kong, Taipei and
Singapore, higher in Manila, and steady in Sydney and
Wellington.
