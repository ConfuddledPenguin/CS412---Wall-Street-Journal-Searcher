   General Electric Co. was ordered to pay a $10 million
criminal fine and agreed in a settlement to pay an additional
$20 million in civil penalties in connection with fraudulent
defense contract billings to the U.S. Army.
   The criminal fine is the second-largest ever against a
defense contractor and the largest against a company accused
of fraudulent pricing. Earlier this year, Los Angeles-based
Northrop Corp. was fined $17 million after pleading guilty to
34 counts of making false statements to the government
involving the company's testing of weapons parts.

   The penalty against GE was announced yesterday in a
federal district court in Philadelphia, where the company and
two suspended employees were convicted of fraud and related
charges last February following a 14-week trial. The two
suspended employees were fined and both received prison
sentences yesterday.
   The trial concerned a 1983 GE contract with the U.S. Army
and GE's aerospace unit, Management &amp; Technical Services Co.,
or MATSCO, to produce a mobile battlefield computer system.
   Prosecutors alleged that the Fairfield, Conn., concern,
the nation's third-largest defense contractor, misrepresented
subcontracting costs and concealed millions of dollars in
cost reductions from government auditors between 1983 and
1985.
   GE was convicted of four counts of mail fraud and 282
counts of filing false claims. Gerald A. Leo, a former
purchasing manager, was convicted of four counts of mail
fraud and one count of submitting false documents to a
government auditor. James Badolato, a former subcontracts
manager, was convicted of one count of obstruction of justice
for trying to cover up the fraud.
   Mr. Leo was sentenced yesterday to 10 months in prison and
was fined $15,000. Mr. Badolato received five months in
prison and was fined $10,000. Both remain free pending their
appeals.
   In addition to paying the $10 million criminal fine, GE
agreed to settle several pending federal civil suits related
to the case for $8.3 million and to pay an additional $11.7
million in connection with several unrelated defense
contracting matters pending in eastern Pennsylvania.
Prosecutors said the latter also involved improper billings,
some of which GE voluntarily disclosed.
   Prosecutors and the company said in a joint sentencing
recommendation to federal Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr., who
presided over the trial, that GE "has taken substantial
measures" since 1985 to ensure ethical conduct in all defense
contracting.
   Nevertheless, prosecutors said that the trial of Messrs.
Leo and Badolato produced evidence of complicity by others at
the company, though not enough to bring additional criminal
charges. "Individuals above Leo and Badolato turned a blind
eye and adopted a look-the-other-way mentality," said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas C. Harbist, who helped
prosecute the case.
   In handing down his sentence against GE, Judge Reed called
the company's behavior "reprehensible" and said the fine was
a sad commentary on GE's "corporate character." GE's MATSCO
unit, in King of Prussia, Pa., was suspended from defense
contracting for two months in 1989.
   As part of GE's settlement of the cases, the company
agreed to forgo all appeals.

   REINSURERS win important victory in federal appeals court.
   In a typical reinsurance arrangement, insurers give up a
portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to a
reinsurance company, which promises to take a portion of any
losses.
   The issue in this case, in the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago, involved what actions the reinsurer
can take if an insurance company with which it is working
becomes insolvent.
   State statutes governing the liquidation of insolvent
insurers generally allow the reinsurer to withhold its loss
payments to the insurance company to offset debts the
insolvent company owes it. This leaves the insolvent insurer
with less money for its liquidation.
   But insurance company liquidators have long argued that
money owed to an insolvent insurer by reinsurance firms can't
be offset by obligations or debts the insolvent firm might
have with its reinsurers.
   In the decision earlier this week, the federal appeals
court sided with the reinsurer and allowed the offset.
   A small amount of money is involved in the Illinois case,
which stemmed from the liquidation of Reserve Insurance Co.,
declared insolvent in 1979. But there are millions of dollars
at stake in court battles over the same issue involving some
of the largest insolvencies in insurance industry history,
most notably the liquidation of Mission Insurance Co. in
California. Regulators are trying to recover $300 million
from Mission's reinsurers.
   If courts generally side with the reinsurers as did the
Seventh Circuit, the amount of funds available to liquidators
to settle the claims of insolvent insurers could be reduced.
   "Anything that allows more offsets will reduce the amount
of money" eventually going to policyholders, said Deborah
Anderson, general counsel for Illinois department that
handles the liquidation of insolvent insurers.
   The issue of reinsurance offsets with insolvent companies
is a hotly contested one in the insurance industry these
days. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners at
its annual meeting last month adopted a model law that would
severely restrict offsets. It's now up to the individual
state legislatures to decide if they want to make the
association's guidelines part of their state statutes.
   The Seventh Circuit is the highest court so far to wrestle
with the thorny issue. The California Supreme Court has
agreed to hear the case stemming from the Mission insolvency
that involves this same offset issue. Reinsurance executives
say the California statutes regarding reinsurance offsets are
similar to the Illinois regulations.
   Ronald A. Jacks, a Chicago attorney who represented the
reinsurers in the Illinois case, believes California's
highest court "will have to take into account the decision of
a highly respected court of appeals."

   KENYAN UNREST has forced a change of venue for September's
International Bar Association meeting. Instead of meeting in
Nairobi, the 12,000-member London-based organization will
assemble in New York City Sept. 19-23. William Reece Smith
Jr. of Tampa, Fla., president of the IBA, cited safety
concerns and the association's disapproval of the recent
imprisonment of several Kenyan lawyers as reasons for the
switch. Three of those lawyers were released yesterday.
