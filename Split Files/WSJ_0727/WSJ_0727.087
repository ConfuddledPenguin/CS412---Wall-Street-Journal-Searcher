   STOUGHTON, Mass. -- He won't have to go barefoot, but Paul
Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer of Reebok
International Ltd., is taking a big pay cut.
   Mr. Fireman, who has been paid an average of $13.6 million
annually the past four years, will get a maximum of just $2
million a year under a new contract -- $1 million in salary
and a bonus of as much as $1 million depending on the
company's profit performance.

   Under his old contract, which expires Jan. 1, Mr. Fireman
received a smaller base salary plus 5% of the footwear
company's pretax earnings. The new contract is for five
years.
   Mr. Fireman has also been awarded a one-time grant of
options to purchase 2.5 million Reebok common shares. The
options will become exercisable in stages over a five-year
period at an average premium of about 18% above the current
market price and will remain exercisable for about 10 years
from the date of grant.
   The earlier compensation agreement dates to when Reebok
was a small company. Mr. Fireman is credited with guiding the
company to its early and rapid growth.
   However, while Mr. Fireman has been among the highest-paid
executives in the U.S. in the past few years, Reebok's growth
has slowed considerably as it has been overtaken by rival
Nike Inc., and its stock price has been sluggish.
   Reebok said, "Directors believed that it was particularly
appropriate to tie Mr. Fireman's long-term compensation
directly to increases in value for Reebok's shareholders."
Mr. Fireman, with his wife, already owns 15% of Reebok's
stock.
   "Today's actions put Mr. Fireman's interests more closely
aligned to the interests of the shareholders," said Steven
Frankel, an analyst at Adams Harkness &amp; Hill Inc., in Boston.
"I don't believe in their wildest dreams {board members} ever
imagined the heights Reebok would reach and the dollars that
would be accrued to Mr. Fireman."
