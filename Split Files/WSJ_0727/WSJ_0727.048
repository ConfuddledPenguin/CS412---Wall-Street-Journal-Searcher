   TOKYO -- Big U.S. securities houses are chipping away at
the Japanese regulatory taboo that prevents them from
handling foreign-exchange transactions in Tokyo.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. have
quietly received permission from the Finance Ministry to
offer securities that regulators previously held to be
foreign-exchange instruments. The securities, which are
denominated in yen, give holders the right to invest in
certain U.S.-dollar denominated securities.

   In addition, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. won permission to offer a
dollar-denominated money-market fund in Japan that
effectively offers current interest rates on demand deposits
-- the first time, Merrill says, that such a product has been
offered by a securities company in Japan.
   Many industry officials here consider the regulatory
concessions the first signs that the Finance Ministry
eventually will permit foreign securities companies here to
deal in foreign exchange. That would be an important
regulatory change, since only banks now are permitted to
handle foreign-exchange transactions in Japan.
   Under Article 65 of Japan's securities code, the country's
securities and banking industries are rigidly separated. The
law is modeled on the U.S.'s Glass-Steagall Act of 1933,
which raises a legal wall between the same industries in the
U.S. But the barriers between the banking and securities
industries have been the subject of considerable debate in
both countries, and some think eventually the walls will be
dismantled.
   In Japan, the Ministry of Finance appears inclined to
allow foreign securities companies such as Salomon and
Goldman Sachs the first chance to push through the wall's
cracks. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business
daily newspaper, reported that the Ministry of Finance
granted Goldman Sachs permission to conduct foreign-exchange
transactions linked to options trades and currency swaps
denominated in yen and dollars.
   An official in the Ministry of Finance's international
banking division said the newspaper's report contained many
inaccuracies and "went too far" in its assertions. He
confirmed that some foreign securities firms recently
received permission to buy and sell yen options on
dollar-denominated securities. But he said permission hadn't
been granted for swaps.
   A spokesman for Goldman Sachs' Tokyo subsidiary declined
to comment on the article.
   While most officials in the financial industry here hail
recent moves by the Finance Ministry to liberalize
restrictions on overseas brokerage houses entering the
banking business, some are critical.
   "The changes are misleading," says a U.S. securities
company executive, who argues that the Finance Ministry
essentially is suggesting that foreign brokerage houses need
a special license to offer financial services that shouldn't
require government approval in the first place.
   "The impression is that there has been this significant
breakthrough, but in fact it's a regression," the executive
said.
   Pressure on the Ministry of Finance to dismantle Article
65 has come mostly from Japan's major banks and securities
companies, who are themselves challenged by so-called
universal banks from other countries. A universal bank offers
both banking and securities products. Such institutions exist
in most European countries, but are restricted in the U.S. as
they are in Japan.
   The first fissure in the wall separating Japan's financial
industries came three years ago. Despite heavy criticism from
domestic financial institutions, the Finance Ministry
permitted foreign bank-owned securities firms to open for
business. Among the new entrants to the business were
securities firms owned by Chase Manhattan Corp., Bankers
Trust Co. and J.P. Morgan Trust Bank. Securities companies
that were acquired by other bank holding companies, including
Citicorp and Security Pacific Corp., were permitted to remain
in business.
   Now foreign securities firms are anticipating a similar
relaxation of the rules governing banks owned by foreign
brokerage houses. Most big brokerage firms already have
banking subsidiaries outside the U.S. -- some of which
themselves have representative offices in Tokyo. The
securities firms' banking business is concentrated in swaps,
forward contracts and other transactions designed to reduce
the foreign-exchange or interest-rate risk their securities
customers otherwise would have to face. They also handle some
deposits and loans for very wealthy clients.
   Currently, foreign securities companies must put all such
business in Japan through locally licensed banks.
   A senior official at one U.S. securities firm said he has
been told by the Finance Ministry that the government will
begin accepting banking applications from foreign brokerage
houses in the last quarter of this calendar year.
   "They're in an awkward regulatory position," says Randy
Harris, the head of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in Japan. "Foreign
banks can have securities companies so it's difficult to
preclude foreign securities companies with representative
banking offices from upgrading to full branch status."
   So confident are the foreign houses that permission will
come through that they already are preparing the structures
of their banks according to rules they say regulators have
told them. The banks will have to be subsidiaries of existing
banking companies -- in other words, branches of the banks
that the securities companies already own in Europe.
   Like the foreign bank-owned securities houses, brokerage
firm-owned banks will have to be half-owned by non-financial
firms. That makes for some strange alliances; among the
partners in the bank-owned securities firms are the San
Francisco-based construction giant Bechtel Group and Chrysler
Corp. So far, none of the securities companies have
identified the companies with which they're negotiating
partnerships.
