   With all the talk of "needed revenue," we should watch
whether the Washington budget summiteers propose ending the
cellular-phone lottery scam. In the past six years, Congress
has forced the Federal Communications Commission to give away
an estimated $30 billion to $40 billion worth of licenses to
operate cellular-phone systems. The winners are a few favored
corporations and speculators; the losers are the taxpayers.
   The cellular-phone industry is booming. The number of
subscribers could grow from 3.5 million now to 20 million by
decade's end, once car makers decide to install cellular
phones as regular features. You'd think Congress would have
charged for these license gold mines by holding an auction.
After all, it already charges for mineral, grazing and timber
rights. Auctions for offshore oil and gas leases alone have
brought in $55 billion over the past 30 years.

   Instead, the cellular lottery scam came about like this.
In 1984 Congress abandoned the awarding of cellular rights
through arbitrary "public interest" hearings. But its
60-year-old theory on the electromagnetic band remains: It's
public property and can't be sold. Rep. John Dingell,
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, pushes through
frequent amendments barring any use of auctions. So instead,
the FCC gives away spectrum space by lottery.
   The cellular lotteries led to perverse windfalls for a
few, lucky individuals. Rural licenses are now worth upward
of $100 a person. Not surprisingly, some 280,000 applications
flooded in just for the 428 rural markets. But "applications
engineering" firms charged only $5,000 for someone to enter
every lottery in partnership with others, and those
applicants stood a 50-50 chance of winning part of a license.
Some congressional offices kindly helped favored constituents
through the maze of paper work.
   Of course, most winners have no interest or expertise in
operating a cellular system. They sell their winning
"tickets" to large companies building nationwide cellular
networks. Many lottery winners realized instant windfalls.
One couple in Ovid, Michigan, sold a license to McCaw
Communications for $4 million, and then won another worth $10
million.
   Both the Reagan and Bush administrations have pleaded with
Congress to end such giveaways to a well-heeled, lucky few.
Last year, the Bush FCC proposed using auctions to assign six
currently unassigned megahertz of the spectrum to cellular
users. The sales would bring in at least $3.3 billion over
two years. Congress refused to act, so the FCC recently had
to assign four of the unused megahertz for air-to-ground
telephone users. It will collect zero revenue from them.
   Congress may be about to repeat its folly. In June, a
House committee approved a bill by Rep. Dingell to make
available for cellular use 200 megahertz now reserved for the
government. The potential revenue from an auction system is
enormous, but Rep. Dingell still doesn't think it's worth
giving up political control of the spectrum.
   Other countries aren't so foolish. In New Zealand, a
left-wing Labor government recently privatized the spectrum
by leasing it to firms on a long-term basis. This gives
lessees a virtual property right; they can, for example, use
their part of the spectrum for whatever use they think best.
   It's now clear that the technical justifications for
government ownership of the electromagnetic spectrum are
specious and outdated. Congress's cellular-phone giveaway
makes it imperative to begin questioning government control
of the airwaves on basic grounds of fiscal common sense.
