   DALLAS -- A Houston investor group increased its stake in
BSN Corp. and demanded a list of shareholders.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Pelham Investment Associates Limited Partnership said it
acquired 46,700 shares of the sporting-goods maker between
May 11 and July 16 for $5.28 to $5.77 a share. That increased
its stake in BSN to 7.3%.

   The investment group said it is seeking the shareholder
list to solicit consents or proxies. The group said
previously that it had discussions with Michael Blumenfeld,
the company's president, about buying a substantial block of
BSN stock and gaining board representation. Mr. Blumenfeld
owns or controls about 15% of BSN stock.
   "We're not going to give them anything," Mr. Blumenfeld
said.
   Separately, BSN reported net income of $522,000 for the
second quarter, a 13% increase from the prior year's
$461,507. Per-share net rose 40% to 14 cents from 10 cents on
nearly one million fewer shares outstanding. Revenue rose
11%, to $25.2 million from $22.7 million.
   For the first half, net income was $347,076, or 15 cents a
share, up from $424,995, or nine cents a share. The most
recent period included an extraordinary credit of $198,924,
or five cents a share, from the early extinguishment of debt.
Revenue rose 11% to $47 million from $42.2 million.
   Mr. Blumenfeld attributed the gains to the cumulative
effect of a restructuring that began in 1988 and included
plant consolidations and management changes, among other
things. Having reached its projected goal of $3 million in
cash flow for the second quarter, and with a $9 million order
backlog, the company said it expects the third quarter to
produce "favorable operating comparisons" to year-earlier
results.
