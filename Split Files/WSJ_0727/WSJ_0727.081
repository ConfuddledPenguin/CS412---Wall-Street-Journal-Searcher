   LONDON -- Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said pretax
profit fell 21% in the first half of 1990, hit by a sharp
decline in the company's industrial-products division.
   The British chemicals giant also announced a major
reorganization of its fertilizer division. ICI said it has
agreed in principle to sell its U.K. fertilizer business, the
biggest of its global fertilizer operations, to Kemira Oy of
Finland. Terms weren't disclosed.

   Shares in ICI, Britain's biggest manufacturer, plunged
nearly 6% on the worse-than-expected earnings for the 1990
first half. ICI shares traded late Thursday at #10.40
($18.81) on London's Stock Exchange, down 65 pence from
Wednesday.
   The results from ICI, the world's fourth-biggest chemical
concern, reinforced perceptions of rough times for bulk
chemical makers. Sluggish economic growth is depressing
demand and prices.
   ICI posted pretax profit of #733 million ($1.33 billion)
in the 1990 first half, down from #925 million a year
earlier. Sales rose 2.7% to #6.82 billion from #6.64 billion.
But the company attributed most of that increase to more
favorable foreign-exchange rates.
   Net profit attributable to shareholders fell 34% to #372
million from #562 million, after a #100 million charge
stemming from the reorganization of fertilizer operations.
