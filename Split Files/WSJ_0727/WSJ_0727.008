   In your July 10 Advertising column "Beleaguered Ayer
Considers Going Public," written after an interview with
Glenn Corlett, Ayer's new chief financial officer, there are
some important misconceptions that I feel need to be set
straight.
   We are not going public. We want the control of our agency
in our own hands. That's the right way to serve clients.

   The article touched on the fact that we are being
contacted by agencies looking for some type of partnering
arrangement with us. Since Ayer is independent, large,
profitable and has the privilege of serving a roster of
blue-chip clients, this type of contact is not surprising.
   We are not "beleaguered." We are, and always have been, a
profitable business. We are not "reeling" from account
losses. In fact, we have gained more than $200 million of new
business world-wide, including $70 million domestically in
the past six months. And we are in the finals of a number of
large and important new business presentations.
   Mr. Corlett has been here for one month. He gave the
reporter good answers to some difficult, probing questions.
How those were incorporated into the story is debatable.
   In my strong opinion, an advertising agency is a
personal-service business whose primary motivation must be to
do the very best it can for its clients. Only a private,
employee-owned agency can totally fulfill this promise.
