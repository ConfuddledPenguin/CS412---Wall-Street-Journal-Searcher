   SOVIET CIGARETTE SHORTAGE

   A shortage of cigarettes in the Soviet Union is prompting
a public outcry.
   The shortage is caused by antiquated manufacturing
equipment, a lack of foreign currency to buy cigarettes
abroad and ethnic unrest in domestic cigarette-producing
areas. It has led to the closing of most tobacco kiosks in
Moscow, forcing indignant consumers to scour the city for an
open shop and then line up for hours.
   Soviet press reports said workers demanding cigarettes
have gone on strike or threatened to stop working in various
regions in the country.
   A pack of foreign cigarettes on the black market goes for
the equivalent of at least $17 and as much as $25.
                                                                                                       

   ZIMBABWE TO AID BLACK FARMERS
                                                                                                       

   Zimbabwe has unveiled plans to create a new class of
wealthy black commercial farmers alongside its powerful white
landowners and to stop foreigners from buying land.
Agriculture Minister Witness Mangwende told Parliament the
plan aimed to bring about "a more balanced racial composition
of the large-scale commercial sector" and also to "ensure
continuity in production." Mr. Mangwende said foreigners who
already owned land would be encouraged to sell it.
                                                                                                       

   BLAMING BANGLADESH'S DOCTORS
                                                                                                       

   Bangladesh's President Hossain Mohammad Ershad proposed a
law to keep specialist physicians from concentrating on
private patients and neglecting their responsibilities in
government hospitals. In a national broadcast on radio and
television, the president blamed the poor health of
Bangladeshis on the greed of specialists and the desire of
young doctors to stay in the cities. "Such personalized and
inhuman tendencies must come to an end if we are to make
success of the government policy to ensure health for
everybody by the year 2000," he said.
                                                                                                       

   CZECHOSLOVAK NUCLEAR PROBLEM
                                                                                                       

   Czechoslovakia acknowledged that one of its nuclear
reactors doesn't meet world safety standards. The reactor at
Jaslovske Bohunice, 200 miles east of Prague, is a source of
friction with Austria, which claims the Soviet-licensed plant
is unsafe and placed on earthquake-prone land.
Czechoslovakia's government admitted in a communique that the
reactor's design, position and safety equipment "do not
comply with world standards" but said "it is not necessary to
stop its operation" without further study.
                                                                                                       

   ADVICE FOR JAPANESE WORKERS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Health Ministry wants the nation's workers to take
more vacations. "We suggest Japanese workers take more free
time, completely away from their place of work, and relax," a
ministry official said. Arduous working conditions, partly
arising from an acute labor shortage, and resulting health
problems prompted the ministry to issue the suggestion, he
said. Japanese workers spend over 2,100 hours a year on the
job, while workers in the U.S. spend 1,924 hours and those in
West Germany 1,655, ministry statistics show.
                                                                                                       

   U.N. MOSCOW CONFERENCE
                                                                                                       

   The United Nations is organizing a conference in Moscow
from Aug. 13 to 17 on switching resources from military to
civilian use. The gathering is titled "Conversion: Economic
Adjustments in an Era of Arms Reduction." More than 100
participants from 40 countries -- including the U.S. and
China -- are expected. Taking part will be representatives
from governments, business, labor, universities and research
institutes.
                                                                                                       

   SUSPENDING PHILIPPINE DEBT
                                                                                                       

   The Philippines' search for debt relief to help recover
from last week's earthquake will take the form of a request
to foreign creditors for a two-and-one-half-year suspension
of debt payments, a member of the government's Foreign Debt
Council said.
   Margarito Teves, chairman of the House of Representatives'
Committee on Economic Affairs, said the council would
estimate the cost of specific reconstruction projects and
would then negotiate the debt-payment moratorium with the
14-nation Paris Club, the Philippines' official creditors,
which includes the U.S., Japan, France, West Germany and
Britain.
   Yesterday, officials estimated that property damage from
the quake totaled 20.77 billion pesos ($907 million), but the
amount is expected to increase.
   President Corazon Aquino will not agree to release funds
frozen by U.S. courts so Imelda Marcos can donate money to
earthquake relief, Mrs. Aquino's press secretary said
yesterday. On Wednesday, a lawyer for Mrs. Marcos said the
former first lady has offered to donate about $5 million for
earthquake relief if U.S. and Philippine officials agree to
release money frozen by U.S. courts.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet KGB is now an officially registered diplomatic
mission in Poland and has the status of Soviet Embassy staff,
said Krzysztof Kozlowski, who heads the Polish ministry that
oversees the police. "If we objected (to the KGB's presence),
there would be agents anyway, only we would not know who they
are," Mr. Kozlowski said. . . . The chairman of the East
German parliament's environment committee called for a ban on
"McDonald's and similar abnormal garbage-makers," deploring
the disposable containers and cutlery used by fast-food
chains. McDonald's plans to open 10 outlets in East Germany
next year.
