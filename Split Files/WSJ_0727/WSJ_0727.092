   Everyone wants to know what David Souter would mean for
abortion. We have the answer. However he votes on Roe v.
Wade, nothing.
   The Supreme Court has already said it is willing to uphold
restrictions on abortions that the states, it turns out, are
unwilling to legislate. Some 40 states have considered about
300 new abortion restrictions during the past year. Only
three states actually approved new laws, and none comes close
to banning abortions. With the passion on both sides, no one
seems to have noticed that the Supreme Court has been made
irrelevant to the availability of abortions by the very force
that the liberal activist Justices feared most: politics.

   Beginning last year, a slight conservative majority issued
opinions that upheld restrictions on abortions such as
parental notifications for minors. This set off an explosion
of political activity. The net results:
   Pennsylvania now requires wives to notify their husbands,
bans abortion for gender selection and prohibits abortions
after the second trimester. South Carolina requires parental
consent. West Virginia passed a law to limit public funding.
Even Louisiana and Idaho are tied in knots.
   If anti-abortion forces do prevail in, say, Louisiana, the
most that will happen is that to get an abortion women will
have to cross a state line. Anti-abortion politicians from
New Jersey to California have been scampering to muddy their
positions.
   As a matter of academic interest, it's also clear how the
David Souters of the bar think about abortion. It is
perfectly clear to anyone who looks that the word "abortion"
does not occur in the Constitution; if a Justice Souter were
presented Roe v. Wade on a blank slate, he'd snort it out of
court. Whether he'd overturn it now depends on how he
balances stare decisis with his duty to uphold the
Constitution. We can totally assure the nervous pro-choice
nellies that he will never read anywhere in the Constitution
that abortion is a crime.
   This important point should not be lost. Justice Souter
will not read through the Constitution to find some penumbra
or emanation declaring that life begins at conception. Nor
will Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
Justice O'Connor. Nor for that matter would a Justice Edith
Jones, a Justice Laurence Silberman or a Justice Clarence
Thomas. Nor a Justice Robert Bork. Instead, they would rule
that abortion is not a constitutional issue for judges, but
an issue reserved to the people to decide for themselves in
the states.
   The wisdom of this position is already evident in the way
the abortion issue is sorting itself out once the court
started to let it. The pro-choice lobby is finding it need
not hide behind the court's skirts, and may eventually stop
talking as if abortion is some kind of sacrament. The
pro-life lobby is at least finally allowed to have its say,
and may start to calm its own hysteria. If it fails to outlaw
abortion in the legislatures, after all, it will still have a
chance to convince women that what's legal is nonetheless
sinful. This process will allow society to resolve its deep
divisions in a much healthier way than having nine Justices
weave constitutional law out of nothing.
   If Roe v. Wade is approaching legal irrelevancy, why are
the liberal activists devoting such efforts in its name? One
reason is that this case is one of the few remaining symbols
of a declining era in the Supreme Court and a fading view of
its proper duties. Liberals since the Warren Court have
regarded the federal courts as their preserve, an institution
that would bus schoolchildren, enforce quotas and advance the
liberal agenda despite its failures at the polls. This will
change as the Reagan and Bush judges at all levels make their
presence felt.
   More broadly, rumbling underneath the debate about Judge
Souter is the fundamental question of what the courts are
for. The business of the Supreme Court is to ensure justice
in accordance with the Constitution. It is no secret that the
American system of justice leaves much to be desired. It is
fair to ask, where was the Supreme Court when the police
discovered they could no longer convict criminals? Where were
the Justices as our civil-liability system imploded with
senseless and costly litigation? The answer is that the court
has ignored rule-of-law problems to find room on its docket
for essentially political cases.
   Instead of irrelevant issues, we'd like to know Judge
Souter's view of the role of the courts. Will he vote to
review the exclusionary rule that suppresses evidence of
crimes? Will he vote to hear cases that can defuse our
litigation explosion? Will he help make the Supreme Court
once again the final arbiter not on social policy, but on
law?
