   NEW YORK -- Every day, it seems, another company jolts
Wall Street with a gloomy outlook for the rest of the year.
Put together, these downbeat corporate forecasts suggest to
some economists on the Street that the economy is moving
closer to recession.
   No longer is the market punishing only the stocks of
companies that report weak earnings. This week, some of the
hardest-hit stocks were companies that, despite respectable
second-quarter profits, painted dim expectations for this
year's third quarter or second half.

   Though the broader stock market hasn't taken much notice,
this drumbeat of caution from Corporate America has the
Street's economists on red alert.
   "I think the economy is teetering on the edge of
recession," Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns,
says. "When you see these big companies warning about
sluggish business conditions, you should take that seriously.
These are the front-line spear carriers, and normally they're
optimists."
   Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, says,
"I don't know that it's appropriate to start talking about
recession." But he adds: "I am more concerned about a
recession than I was a few months ago. . . . There is simply
more anecdotal evidence of weakness than there is anecdotal
evidence of strength."
   Witness the carnage of last Tuesday. Three major companies
at which revenue depends on distinctly different businesses
-- consumer advertising, financial services, and commodity
chemicals -- each offered a grim prospect for the third
quarter or second half. Their stocks promptly fell 9% to 15%.
   Capital Cities/ABC reported a 4.6% increase in
second-quarter earnings per share, but said third-quarter
earnings may fall below the year-earlier level, if the
"relatively flat demand" for television, radio and newspaper
advertising continues. Its stock fell 55 1/2 to 533 Tuesday,
though it has since recovered, closing yesterday at $554.125.
   Reuters Holdings, which posted a 26% increase in pretax
per-share profit for the first half, warned of high
cancellation rates for its financial information services and
said full-year growth will be slower. Its American depositary
receipts plunged 10 points to 56 1/4 on Tuesday; two days
later, they still languished at 57 1/8.
   Wall Street wasn't startled when Dow Chemical posted
second-quarter profit of $1.34 a share, down from $2.70 a
year earlier. What upset analysts was the company's statement
that second-half results are likely to be even "softer" than
those for the first half. The lone ray of hope: Dow Chemical
is aiming for cost-cutting to "help offset business
conditions in the second half." Dow stock fell 5 3/4 to 52
3/8 on Tuesday, and by yesterday's close, was just 1/8
higher.
   Another casualty: Gerber Scientific, which makes
computerized drawing and cutting equipment, said Tuesday that
it expects earnings for the six months ending Oct. 31 "to be
significantly lower" than those of a year earlier, because of
"softness in order entry in all major product areas." The
next day, Gerber stock fell 2 7/8 to 10 3/8, a 22% drop that
led the percentage losers list on the New York Stock Exchange
and has since been followed by further slippage to 9 7/8.
   The bad news has continued among smaller capital-goods
manufacturing companies. AMP, which makes solderless
electrical wire terminals, managed to post a 3.7% rise in
second-quarter per-share earnings on Wednesday, but said its
U.S. sales declined slightly, because of sluggishness in the
economy and electronics industry. For the second half, AMP
predicted "continued flatness" in its U.S. business. The
shares fell 1 3/8 on Wednesday and declined 1 1/8 yesterday,
to 45.
   Just before the close of trading Wednesday, Tecumseh
Products, which makes compressors for refrigeration and
air-conditioning systems, said the second half "will be a
difficult one," with earnings likely to be "materially lower"
than year-earlier net income. Tecumseh shares slid 2
yesterday, to close at 111.
   Of course, such examples don't prove that the economy is
headed into recession. Many other companies have been
reporting robust second-quarter earnings and haven't made
gloomy second-half predictions.
   But the recent chorus of downbeat corporate predictions
"certainly says that the company managements in a whole
variety of areas are seeing business trends that cause them
to scale back their expectations for the second half of
1990," Richard B. Hoey, chief U.S. economist for Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, says. "And that probably does reflect a worsening
economy."
   Mr. Hoey says the current tone of company statements about
future business is what "you expect to see, as the economy is
in that transition zone between expansion and contraction."
   Unlike most Wall Street economists, Mr. Hoey for some time
has been predicting a recession in the second half of this
year. He says it will be only a "borderline recession," the
severity of which will depend more on its duration than its
depth. In the past year or so, he notes, the U.S. has
experienced a "rolling recession" that hit specific regions
and industries, while national economic statistics continued
to show some growth.
   Today, the government will unveil its first estimate of
economic activity for the second quarter. A survey of 50
economists in early July by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of
Sedona, Ariz., yielded a consensus estimate of 1.8%
inflation-adjusted growth in gross national product. Since
then, however, downward revisions have moved other consensus
estimates to 1.5%.
   Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch isn't predicting a
second-half recession. But he believes the economy will be
weak enough to cause the Federal Reserve Board to ease access
to credit, in an effort to prevent a recession.
   But Mr. Kudlow of Bear Stearns notes that because it takes
time for a Fed easing to work its way into the economy, there
is little the Fed can do now to affect the third and fourth
quarters. "Changes in Fed policy this summer probably won't
impact the economy until the winter or spring of next year,"
Mr. Kudlow says.
   Meanwhile, Corporate America's somber tone will provide
ammunition for those who oppose all the Washington talk of
higher taxes. "A tax increase right now, with the economy on
the cusp of recession, would be exactly the wrong medicine,"
says Mr. Kudlow, a veteran of the Reagan administration's
Office of Management and Budget. "That's what these companies
are trying to tell us."
