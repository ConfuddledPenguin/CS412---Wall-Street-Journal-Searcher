for a power station in Morocco.
   The company, a joint unit of France's Cie. Generale

thermal power station will use coal, oil, and natural gas as
fuels. The plant will be situated at Jorf Lasfar, south of
Casablanca.

first of a series of six identical power generating stations.

Spanish unit of Babcock &amp; Wilcox of the U.S., which is a unit
of McDermott Inc., as well as Dragados &amp; Construccionnes
