   LIMA, Peru -- Alberto Fujimori becomes president of Peru
tomorrow after winning the approval of more voters than any
other candidate in Peru's history. As first president of
Japanese ancestry, Mr. Fujimori faces an almost biblical set
of problems: economic collapse, violent insurrection and the
nation's worst drought in memory.
   Peru is falling apart, and for his effort to put it
together again, Mr. Fujimori controls only small minorities
in the Legislature. His popular support, which comes mostly
from the poor, could easily evaporate if their lot worsens.

   Mr. Fujimori campaigned on a pledge to bring "readjustment
without recession," but he already has hinted he will be
forced to break his vow -- and soon -- by imposing austerity
measures under guidelines laid down by the International
Monetary Fund. Peruvians have coined a phrase for the
expected moves: "Fujishock."
   The prospects unnerve members of Mr. Fujimori's
government. Shortly after being named, his prime minister,
Juan Carlos Hurtado-Miller, confessed to a reporter that he
was "very scared" about taking the job. Worries Esteban
Hnylicza, an economic adviser, "The country is in such bad
shape, there is a big risk the country may explode."
   Is Mr. Fujimori worried? He shrugs: "They are just
technical problems." The agronomist and one-time
mathematician adds, "And I'm a political engineer," as he
escorts a visitor through the tightly guarded armed forces
officers club, where he has been living for security reasons.
   A part of Mr. Fujimori's confidence seems to stem from his
meteoric political rise. Just a few months ago, he was a
total unknown. "My relatives didn't believe in me," Mr.
Fujimori says. "My brother said I was crazy." Only his
15-year-old daughter, Keiko, thought Mr. Fujimori would make
it. She saw it in a dream.
   Peru's disastrous economy is Mr. Fujimori's most immediate
challenge. In the past two years, gross national product fell
22%, while real income slumped 63%. Inflation topped 1,500%
in 1988 and surpassed 3,500% in the past 12 months.
   The crisis has devastated an already poor country. Almost
40% of Peruvians suffer from malnutrition. Two-thirds of
Lima's six million-plus residents live in shantytowns, often
in roofless cubicles with straw walls.
   Lima, once the proud seat of Spanish viceroys, has become
a chaotic bazaar, its streets home to thousands of peddlers
and thousands more money-changers, buying and selling
dollars. Money-changing is one of the few growth industries.
   Middle-class and business districts go without water and
electricity for days at a time, the result of the drought and
sabotage of electric installations by guerrillas. The
situation is even worse in the countryside. Drought has
destroyed half of Peru's potato, corn and barley crops. More
than two million peasants are at risk.
   Mr. Fujimori says he will take quick steps to put Peru's
economy in order but offers few specifics. Peruvians
nevertheless are bracing for drastically higher prices on
now-subsidized goods, such as bread and gasoline.
   The economic crisis has aggravated Mr. Fujimori's second
headache, the bloody 10-year war waged by Sendero Luminoso,
or "Shining Path," a sect-like group led by a former
philosophy professor who may or may not be dead and whose nom
de guerre is "Presidente Gonzalo, the Fourth Sword of
Marxism."
   "The situation will get worse, and that's good for
revolutionaries," says a 60-ish Shining Path activist, a
university professor who sits slumped in the empty lobby of a
once-elegant Lima hotel. "We must destroy everything so
something green can emerge," he says.
   Shining Path now challenges the military for control of
about half of Peru's territory. More than 18,000 people have
died in the conflict. Frustrated by its inability to defeat
the guerrillas, the army has frequently taken out its ire on
the civilian population, various human rights organizations
say. The result: murders, massacres and disappearances.
   It is a war that will get worse. "The country is in a
state of subversion," says a Peruvian military analyst. "We
can't kill the whole indigenous population."
   Mr. Fujimori says he is willing to negotiate with Sendero,
but Sendero doesn't negotiate. "The army will be totally
defeated," says the professor, who thinks that the crimes of
Cambodia's Pol Pot and the Soviet Union's Josef Stalin have
been exaggerated. "No. Not defeated," he says, after a pause.
"Destroyed."
   While the combustible combination of hyperinflation and
terrorism is the stuff of Lima nightmares, the U.S. has
different concerns about Peru. More than half the coca leaf
used in the world's cocaine trade is grown in Peru's Alto
Huallaga valley, a jungle region near its Colombian and
Brazilian borders. Washington's goal in Peru is to stop the
cocaine trade.
   But the Alto Huallaga is a Shining Path stronghold. The
guerrillas made great strides in the valley by defending
coca-growing campesinos from Colombian traffickers and from
sometimes corrupt Peruvian police. Shining Path's services
aren't free. It earns at least $1 million a month from its
protection rackets, U.S. and Peruvian officials say.
   The U.S. and Peru are negotiating a $35.9 million military
aid package that would pay for equipment and training by U.S.
advisers of about six Peruvian army battalions to be used in
operations against both drug traffickers and Shining Path
guerrillas in the Alto Huallaga.
   Already, U.S. Special Forces trainers and Drug Enforcement
Administration agents are involved in training Peruvian
police forces at two bases in the valley. At one base, Santa
Lucia, pistol-packing U.S. officials and Peruvian police have
set up a simulated cocaine-base production farm and
laboratory, complete with fake Shining Path guerrillas
guarding fake shipments. They show it off to visiting
journalists.
   Not everyone in the Peruvian military is pleased by the
U.S. efforts. Gen. Alberto Arciniegas, a former military
commander of the Alto Huallaga, opposes the drug eradication
program, arguing that it drives the local population into the
arms of the rebels. He dismisses the demonstration center at
Santa Lucia as "Disneyworld."
   Gen. Arciniegas, echoing the opinion of many of his
colleagues, says the U.S. military agreement is positive, as
the Peruvian military is underequipped. But bringing in
advisers or troops would be disastrous, he says. "If the
Americans come, we will be handing Sendero the
anti-imperialist banner to wave."
   Mr. Fujimori probably has little choice but to cooperate
with the U.S. "Fujimori is in no position to demand
anything," says a military analyst who advises the
president-elect. "Foreign debt negotiations and our return to
the international community depend on what the State
Department wants on drug trafficking."
