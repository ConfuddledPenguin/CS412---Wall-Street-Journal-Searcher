   LONDON -- Rolls-Royce PLC, Aeritalia and a unit of Alfa
Romeo S.p.A. have agreed to jointly manufacture castings for
gas turbine engines in Italy, the companies said.
   The three will hold equal shares in the joint venture, to
be known as Europea Microfusioni Spaziali, which is to build
a #25 million ($45.2 million) factory in southern Italy.

   Financial details of the venture weren't disclosed. The
Italian government is partially funding construction of the
plant, the companies said.
   The castings will be used in the Rolls-Royce Tay engine
program. The venture will eventually make castings for the
Rolls-Royce engine that equips the Tornado jet fighter, built
by a European consortium that includes Aeritalia and British
Aerospace PLC, and the engine proposed for the European
Fighter Aircraft, planned by another pan-European consortium.
