   LONDON -- Sales of new cars in Europe fell 11% in June
from a year earlier, reflecting a decline in all major
markets.
   The June data also show an 11% drop from May, when sales
were up 3.8% on the year. Analysts still predict a year of no
worse than flat, sluggish sales. But some say that, if the
trend goes into July, the downturn could be cause for
concern.

   Industry and government statistics from 12 countries that
normally account for 94% of non-communist Europe's
passenger-car sales totalled 1.01 million in June, down from
1.14 million in May and down from 1.13 in June 1989.
   Analysts cautioned that month-to-month data can fluctuate
widely, making it difficult to judge trends on the basis of a
single month's data. Some noted that the June figures suffer
from comparison with the strong sales of a year ago, when the
monthly total was 6.8% up on June 1988.
   West German new-car sales are expected to rise generally
over the year as East Germans buy either new cars or
second-hand cars, forcing more West German consumers into the
new-car market. In June, West German car sales fell 8% to
259,254 from June 1989 and dropped 9.4% from May.
   France's data showed car sales falling 8.4% in June to
152,100 from a year earlier and off 23% from May. Italian
new-car sales lost 5.7% in June to 208,790 from June 1989 and
were off 5.5 % from May.
   The U.K. experienced the biggest declines, with June sales
down 18% on both the year and month to 142,697. Spain's data
showed June sales down 21% to 91,816 compared to June 1989
and off 1.9% from May.
