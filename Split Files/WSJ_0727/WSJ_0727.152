   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- American Savings Bank reported a $40
million second-quarter net loss, reflecting an increase of
$41 million in reserves against possible losses on bad loans.
   American Savings and many other Northeast banks and
thrifts have been hurt by the slump in the region's real
estate markets.

   The New York state chartered bank made loan-loss
provisions of $54.3 million in 1990's first six months.
American Savings said it will proceed with a "back to basics"
strategy, consolidating its Riverhead Savings operations and
pursuing the sale of other subsidiaries to cut costs and pare
assets.
   American's second-quarter net loss equals $6.89 a share,
compared with net income of $7.4 million, or $1.01 a share,
in the year-earlier period. The year-earlier period included
a one-time gain of $3.5 million before taxes from an
insurance settlement for a subsidiary.
   The latest quarter's net interest income before provision
for loan losses fell 18% to $19.5 million from $23.7 million
in the yearearlier period.
   For the first six months of 1990, American Savings
reported a loss of $49.4 million, or $8.67 a share, compared
with earnings of $13.9 million, or $1.88 a share. The
year-ago period reflects the one-time gain. Net interest
income excluding provisions for loan losses declined 21% to
$39 million from $49.6 million.
   At June 30, American's assets totaled $4.14 billion, down
6.5% from Dec. 31 and 9.5% from June 30, 1989.
