   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. posted a 23% increase
in third-quarter net income on a 32% increase in revenue
spurred by a solid performance in its theme parks and surging
movie profits.
   The entertainment company earned $238.5 million, or $1.75
a share, in the period, compared with $193.3 million, or
$1.40 a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $1.53
billion from $1.16 billion a year ago.

   The third-quarter earnings were about what analysts had
been projecting. "No big surprises in this quarter," said
Harold Vogel, entertainment analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
"Maybe a slight touch lighter than some people had
projected-but only a penny or two a share."
   Growth companies such as Disney have been under intense
scrutiny by Wall Street lately; any faltering in the earnings
growth rate has led to a sell-off of the stock. Disney
released its earnings yesterday after the market closed. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Disney shares
closed at $121, up $2.125.
   "The 23% gain certainly exceeds Disney's targeted goal of
a 20% earnings increase for every quarter," said Jeffrey
Logsdon, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc., Los
Angeles. "They keep cranking them out."
   Disney's biggest business segment, its theme parks and
resort operations, showed a 14% increase in operating income
to $288.5 million for the quarter, up from $252.3 million a
year ago. Revenue for the theme park segment rose 18%.
   Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said that through June 30,
"things have been going well" at the company's theme parks.
He declined to comment on how theme park attendance has been
doing in July.
   Mr. Vogel said attendance at Disney theme parks in the
third quarter had an "easy" comparison with last year's third
quarter. The company had its Disney-MGM studio tour operating
all three months this quarter compared with only part of the
quarter a year ago, he said. In addition, the Easter vacation
fell into April this year, compared with an earlier Easter a
year ago, which diffused the Easter vacation attendance surge
into last year's second quarter, he said.
   Some analysts have been concerned that economic
uncertainty has been affecting theme parks around the U.S.
Mr. Vogel said he thinks that attendance at Disneyland and
Walt Disney World has recently been "flattening -- but there
is no reason to be alarmed." Disney doesn't disclose
attendance numbers for its Disneyland and Walt Disney World
theme parks.
   Led by "Pretty Woman," the industry's highest grossing
movie this year, and home video sales of "The Little
Mermaid," an animated feature, the operating income for
Disney's filmed entertainment segment rose 35% in the quarter
to $73.3 million from $54.5 million a year ago. "Pretty
Woman's box office success is significant because it wasn't
an expensive movie to make," Mr. Okun said.
   "Dick Tracy," released in June, had "very strong box
office results," the company said. Through last weekend,
"Dick Tracy" had a box office gross of $95 million, Disney
said.
   Operating income for consumer products, including "Dick
Tracy" merchandise, increased 18% for the quarter to $46
million from $39 million a year ago.
   For the nine months ended June 30, Disney's profit rose
21% to to $591.3 million, or $4.29 a share, from $490.6
million, or $3.56 a share, a year ago. Revenue climbed 27% to
$4.13 billion from $3.24 billion a year earlier.
