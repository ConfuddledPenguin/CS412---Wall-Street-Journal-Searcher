   Bank of East Asia Ltd. said consolidated profit rose 15%
in the year's first six months.
   The Hong Kong bank said consolidated profit, after
undisclosed transfers to inner reserves, rose to 104 million
Hong Kong dollars (US$13.4 million), or 38 cents a share,
from HK$90 million, or 33 cents a share, a year ago.

   The board proposed raising the per-share interim dividend
to 25 cents from 21 cents.
   Keith Wu, research manager at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers
Hong Kong Ltd., said the performance was surprisingly strong,
considering the weakness of the local economy in the period.
But he cautioned that the figures are difficult to interpret
because of local banks' ability to move cash to and from
secret reserves.
   Mr. Wu called the dividend "very generous," adding that he
expects the full-year payout to total around 75 cents a
share. He said he is still forecasting the bank's full-year
profit at HK$388 million.
