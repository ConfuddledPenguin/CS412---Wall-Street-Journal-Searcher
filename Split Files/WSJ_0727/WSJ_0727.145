   Revco D.S. Inc., Twinsburg, Ohio, said it agreed to sell
13 drug stores in Arkansas to Affiliated Food Stores, Little
Rock, Ark., but didn't disclose the price.
   The drugstore chain operator said it has disposed of 538
of the 712 stores it plans to shed as part of a restructuring
disclosed in January. Revco is operating with protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy statutes.

   The company said it will reduce its store base to 1,100
outlets in 10 Eastern states to improve efficiency and
increase its return on assets. Revco is trying to sell stores
in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Texas as well as two
remaining outlets in Arkansas.
