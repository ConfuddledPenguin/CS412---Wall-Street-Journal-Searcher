   CINCINNATI -- U.S. Shoe Corp. reshuffled top executives in
its footwear operations, giving Bannus B. Hudson, president
and chief executive officer, a more hands-on role in that
group.
   Martin Schulman, group president of domestic footwear, was
promoted to president of footwear manufacturing and
wholesaling, effective Sept. 1. He will report to Mr. Hudson.

   Mr. Schulman, 51 years old, will take over a major part of
the job of Howard Platt, who will retire as U.S. Shoe
executive vice president and president of both footwear
wholesaling and retailing. Mr. Platt, 63, will continue as a
consultant to the company, managing projects for the footwear
group.
   Mr. Schulman will have responsibility for both U.S.
footwear manufacturing operations and for wholesaling
imported shoes. However, Charles Goorman will continue as
president of footwear retailing, reporting to Mr. Hudson.
Previously, he reported to Mr. Platt.
   Mr. Hudson said the new arrangement will permit him to be
more directly involved in retailing, an area where he had
extensive experience developing U.S. Shoe's successful
Lenscrafters optical division.
   U.S. Shoe was a footwear concern that diversified into
specialty retailing, which is now its largest business. For
the fiscal year ended Feb. 3, the company earned $49.2
million, or $1.10 a share, on sales of $2.56 billion.
   Earlier this year, the company reported accounting
irregularities at Marx &amp; Newman, its shoe importing unit.
However, the management changes aren't a direct result of
that problem, Mr. Hudson said.
   Michael Geller was promoted to chief executive officer of
the Marx &amp; Newman division, filling the position vacated by
the May 1 retirement of Howard Glick. Mr. Geller joined U.S.
Shoe last January, after 27 years in the footwear industry,
including manufacturing experience in Italy.
