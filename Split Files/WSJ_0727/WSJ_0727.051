   Ashton-Tate Corp., a maker of database software, will
announce a revamped version of its flagship database product
Tuesday, industry observers say. The arrival of the product,
which has been plagued by delays, could signal a reversal of
the company's sagging fortunes.
   Ashton-Tate declined to provide details about the
announcement, but industry observers say the company will
begin shipping dBASE IV version 1.1 immediately.

   Invitations to the unveiling of the new product were
received by industry officials Wednesday, sending
Ashton-Tate's stock surging to $10.50, up $1.125. Yesterday,
the stock closed at $10.375, down 12.5 cents.
   Nearly two years ago, Ashton-Tate introduced the original
version of dBASE IV, but when customers complained about the
product's shortcomings the company promised to release a
revamped version within months. However, the work required to
correct dBASE IV's many programming errors stretched on far
longer than the company anticipated. In the meantime,
Ashton-Tate, once one of the world's biggest software
companies, slipped far behind the industry's leaders.
   Users, who have tested the new product, say it isn't
saddled with the flaws that bedeviled the earlier release.
"Unlike {the original} dBASE IV, this one is going to work as
advertised," said Michael Masterson, president of a large
user group in Silicon Valley.
   Database experts say the new version of dBASE, if it
doesn't face unexpected technical problems, should enable
Ashton-Tate to halt declining sales and even regain some of
its share in the database market, which has fallen sharply in
recent years. "This shores things up," said Jeffrey Tarter,
editor of Softletter, an industry newsletter.
   But the product isn't considered a barnburner, nor
something that will by itself restore Ashton-Tate to software
prominence.
   `It has passed my tests for reliability and performance,"
said Adam Green, a database consultant in Lexington, Mass.
"But for excitement Ashton-Tate must get out quality products
consistently. This is not a matter of selling a single
product."
   Sales of dBASE 1.1 will help, though. Ashton-Tate's
revenue fell 24% to $48.1 million in the second quarter.
Analysts said the decline was partly due to buyers holding
off in anticipation of the release of a new dBASE.
