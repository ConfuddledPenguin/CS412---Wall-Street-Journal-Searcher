   PARIS -- Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy said
yesterday that France will repay virtually all of its
outstanding external debt by the end of this week through
prepayments equivalent to about $400 million.
   Mr. Beregovoy told a meeting of journalists that the
payments, to be made July 27, will cover the last $350
million of a $4 billion loan contracted by France in 1982 to
shore up France's official reserves of foreign currency.
France will also pay off 40 million European Currency Units
($50.9 million) of a 4 billion-ECU loan taken out in 1983 for
the same purpose.

   The minister said the two payments would leave 30 million
ECUs of external debt outstanding. This amount is part of a
fixed-maturity borrowing that comes due in 1993. Terms of
this borrowing won't allow France to make prepayments until
July 1, 1991, and this will be done, Mr. Beregovoy said.
   Mr. Beregovoy said the move was made possible by the
strength of the franc, the high level of French official
reserves and the strong performance of its economy.
   The debt reduction effort will make France one of Europe's
least indebted states.
