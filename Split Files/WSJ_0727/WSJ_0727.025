   The action against Mr. Durrani -- formerly employed with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.; E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., a Shearson
predecessor; Oppenheimer &amp; Co., and Moseley Hallgarten,
Estabrook &amp; Weeden Inc. -- was among several disciplinary
moves the exchange made.
   The exchange charged that Mr. Durrani, among other things,
misappropriated a security owned by a customer, effected
unauthorized trades, and caused an account statement with
false and misleading data to be issued to a customer.

membership and fines include:
   Michael John Boorse, Horsham, Pa., 18 months and $5,000;
Susan B. Weston, Waukegan, Ill., one year; Ronald Alan
Rubenstein, Randolph, N.J., nine months; Howard George
Einhorn Jr., Huntington, N.Y., four months.
   The exchange barred the following individuals until they
comply with its requests for information or testimony: Derek
J. Baxter, Jersey City, N.J.; Edgar Bellenger Cooper,
Nashville; Steven C. Rickun, Glendale, Wis., and Arthur
Gladre Stevenson III, Grover, Mo.
   The following settled charges without admitting or denying
wrongdoing:
   Jeffrey E. Bonham, Lafayette, N.Y., barred from
membership; David Michael Swope, Ontario, Calif., three
years; James Michael Owen, Richmond, Va., one year; Mark A.
Willman, Dunkirk, Md., two months; Raymond Joseph LeVan,
Whitmore Lake, Mich., one month; Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, New
York, $20,000; the People's Securities Inc. subsidiary of

N.Y., Joel David Kaminer, Coral Gables, Fla., and Wallace
Rogers Smith, Charlotte, Vt., censure only.

couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

avoid the cost of litigation, while Mr. Frost declined to
