   While most foreign observers have by now come to
understand that Mikhail Gorbachev's successes in
international diplomacy have been offset by economic failures
at home, they do not perhaps know the whole picture. There
are growing signs that the Soviet Union's economic situation
is more serious now than in the pre-"perestroika" period, or
indeed than at any time since World War II. Unless something
changes soon, the country's economy will break.
   There are some indications that it might already be too
late. For example, earlier this month, a senior Soviet
economist and an executive of one of the country's economic
reform commissions told me that, as of May, the consumer
goods distribution system was no longer functioning. Goods
were no longer showing up in the stores at the prices set for
them.

   What makes the present situation especially critical is
that there is good reason to believe that the Soviet Union
will not come out of this depression. In the West,
depressions are often cyclical and essentially
self-correcting. They also respond to policy change. In the
Soviet Union, however, there is unlikely to be a domestic
remedy for the current economic crisis. The Soviet Union
seems to lack the antibodies that cure economic disease in
other societies.
   Once the Soviet economy becomes unstabilized, a free fall
is hard to prevent. Until recently, this was not a problem
because the momentum of the economy was almost always one of
growth. In Stalin's time, that growth was fueled by
intimidation, terror and wartime patriotism. In the postwar
era, the growth was fueled by squandering the Soviet Union's
vast horde of raw materials, particularly energy. In the
1970s and early 1980s, the Soviet Union exported more than
$200 billion dollars in oil. These exports enabled the Soviet
Union to pay for imports such as grain that were necessary
because of the inefficiency of its system. Like so many of
the world's other oil exporters, the Soviet Union has nothing
left to show for all that wealth now but depleted oil fields
-- and rich American farmers.
   In the absence of such external stimuli, the Soviet
economy is extremely vulnerable. What in more robust times
were Soviet strengths, in a time of collapse become
impediments to recovery. Despite perestroika, the Soviet
system, for example, still precludes bankruptcy and
unemployment. That leads to obsolete products, noncompetitive
prices, continually increasing subsidies and, ultimately,
deficits in the national budget. All of this must be financed
by Gosbank, the central bank.
   The government increases subsidies because it is reluctant
to raise food prices in government stores, which, it fears,
would bring unemployment and lead to civil unrest. This comes
at a cost. Despite cuts in military expenditures, the Soviet
budget deficit has grown to at least 10% of gross national
product. (By comparison, the U.S. deficit is 3% to 4% of
GNP.) To keep functioning with a deficit of this magnitude,
the Soviets have printed money.
   During the first four months of 1990, salaries and wages
rose 14.4% even though GNP fell by nearly 2% -- before
inflation, which some estimate is racing along at 20% a year.
A few Soviet economists even warn of hyperinflation.
   Once prices start rising in peasant markets and in
cooperative stores, the markets and coops suck in lower-price
goods. That is, the goods move to the stores where they
command the higher price. For state stores, it thus becomes
very hard to maintain supply. This embitters those dependent
on state stores and leads to social unrest and strikes.
Strikes are compounded by unrest precipitated by ethnic
violence. The growing sense of economic chaos in turn
aggravates ethnic separatism. Such disruptions combine to
produce a breakdown in a taut economic system like the Soviet
Union's, which has always had shortages and where producers
have tended to operate as monopolists. An unexpected
disruption in one sector of the economy reverberates
throughout the whole system.
   When, for instance, Azerbaijan embargoed all rail
shipments to Armenia in January, the Vladimir Tractor
Factory, not far from Moscow, found itself cut off from its
Armenian -- and only -- source of tires. There was no
alternate tire manufacturer with excess capacity, and, of
course, no wholesaler. So the Vladimir Factory can offer only
tireless tractors. Such tractors are of no use to farmers,
who now find it difficult to bring in what otherwise was
expected to be a good harvest. For that matter, those farmers
with tractors find themselves short of diesel fuel because
the oil workers in Siberia have been protesting work
conditions.
   The majority of the country's coal miners have struck
twice this year. Leningrad and Moscow subway workers have
walked out to protest deteriorating standards of living and
the breakdown of operating safety. All of this is reflected
in the growing number of railroad and pipeline accidents as
well as an increase in the number of workers on strike at any
one time. During the first half of 1989, an average of 15,000
workers were on strike every day. That increased during the
second half of 1989 to 50,000 and 130,000 during the first
five months of 1990.
   Strikes, infrastructure collapse and growing inflation
have led to further declines in production, including oil
output, which was down to 145 million tons in the first
quarter of this year, compared with 152 million tons a year
earlier and 156 million tons in the first quarter of 1988.
   The cigarette industry is affected too. Filters for the
cigarettes are made in ethnically turbulent Armenia and
Latvia. This disruption plus a cardboard shortage has forced
the closing of all but six of the country's 24 cigarette
factories, leading to cigarette riots in some cities
including Dnepropetrovsk in the Ukraine.
   The absence of goods and the increase in prices have
created a crisis of confidence in the ruble. Its value in
internal auctions -- the closest place to a free market for
currency a Soviet manager can find -- has fallen 60% since
November. In the large cities, cab drivers want foreign
currencies like dollars, or goods, like Marlboros. On my
visit this month I noticed for the first time many Russians
carrying rolls of dollar bills in their pockets, including
$100 notes.
   The provinces are now suffering from the same problems.
Why trade near worthless rubles for valuable grain? Even if
their tractors had tires and diesel fuel, the peasants would
hold back. That is why, despite a 50% increase in government
prices paid to the farmers (there goes that budget deficit
again), grain deliveries to the state so far this year are
down by more than one-third from last year -- which was also
down from the year before.
   A drop in grain deliveries has increased pressure to
expand grain imports. But Soviet officials say they don't
have the money to buy the grain. In part, this is due to the
drop in production of the Soviet Union's main hard-currency
commodity, oil. It has necessitated a drop in oil exports of
at least 10% to 15%. This, combined with the growing lack of
control and coordination from the center (as one economist
put it "today we have neither carrots nor sticks"), has
resulted in an unprecedented foreign credit arrears.
   Some American grain dealers are stuck with overdue bills
worth $100 million and have stopped delivering. A senior
Soviet official told me earlier this month that the Soviet
Union is now $3 billion in arrears. That coincidentally
approximates the size of the West German credit to the Soviet
Union. This of course, has had major foreign-policy
consequences: As one Soviet paper headlined it, "The Soviet
Government Sells East Germany to West Germany for 5 billion
Marks." It also explains the sale of Soviet gold and the
newly announced diamond sales agreement with De Beers.
   As concern about the ineptitude of Mr. Gorbachev's
economic policies grows, so does the mood of "every man for
himself." Western Europeans may be uniting, but the Soviet
Union is disintegrating. Six republics have declared their
economic sovereignty and some of them have set up their own
banks.
   Nor does this disintegration stop with the republics.
Major cities like Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Odessa have
begun to insist on taking control, not only from the Union,
but also from republic authorities. Moscow city authorities,
for example, have moved to take control of factories,
heretofore subordinate to ministries at both the all-Union
and republic levels. Moscow is even making plans to issue its
own currency.
   In the meantime, as long as there can be no unemployment
and bankruptcy, subsidies and inflation will increase, as
will strikes, the disruption of production and the hoarding
of supplies. This in turn will increase the need to import
and reduce the country's potential to export and pay its
bills. It is not a happy prospect.
