   CINCINNATI -- Penn Central Corp. said it will buy back up
to 6 million shares of common stock at $26 a share.
   The company said it will mail an offer to shareholders as
soon as possible, and that the offer isn't contingent upon
any minumum number of shares being tendered.

   The company reserved the right to buy back up to an
additional 1.5 million shares if the offer is oversubscribed.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Penn Central closed at $25 a share, up $1.625.
   Penn Central, a manufacturing, defense services, insurance
and energy concern, has 62.7 million shares outstanding.
   Carl H. Lindner, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the stock "is currently undervalued," especially in
relation to the June 30 book value of $28.50 a share.
   American Financial Corp., Cincinnati, a financial holding
company that Mr. Lindner also heads, said it won't tender any
of its Penn Central shares. American Financial owns 34.3% of
the stock, and its ownership will rise to 37.9% if 6 million
shares are bought back by Penn Central.
   In addition, directors exempted Penn Central from all
provisions of the new Pennsylvania anti-takeover law.
