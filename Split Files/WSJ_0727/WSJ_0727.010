   Houston -- The shooter started the morning with the usual
gentle nervousness one feels when trying a sport for the
first time. "I've never shot sporting clays. I've only shot
skeet -- twice," the gunner admitted while studying the clays
course at the American Shooting Center here.
   Eventually a gun was uncased and the shooter stepped up to
try the first shots of the day. Signs of anxiety continued as
the gunner finished the first station, as well as the second
and the third.

   But there was a definite transformation on station number
four. The shooter said "pull" and an accelerated target
bounced and rolled from left to right. Instinct took over and
the shooter snapped the gun up and shot, shattering the
four-inch disk. You could hear the confidence building when
the next target was called. It, too, was broken quickly and
cleanly.
   Shellie Collier opened her over-under shotgun, tucked it
under her arm and headed for station five wearing the broad
smile of someone who's just discovered a new love. It's the
kind of smile that's being seen in almost epidemic frequency
on sporting-clays fields across America.
   Basically unheard of in the U.S. a decade ago, sporting
clays is unquestionably one of the fastest growing sports in
the country. January 1986 saw but three American
sporting-clays courses. Current estimates range from 300 to
500 or more.
   Popular in Europe for a half-century, some say sporting
clays is the optimum marriage of wing and target shooting.
Every station and course are unique, offering shooters
targets that resemble the challenges of gunning in the wilds.
Typical stations include targets settling in over a pond like
landing ducks or fast, vertical climbing targets like flushed
woodcock. For added realism targets come in four different
sizes.
   Sporting clays also attracts different varieties of
shooters, lots of beginners -- and women like Ms. Collier. In
fact, the day she had her first experience with sporting
clays it was females-only at the course west of Houston. The
Dallas-based businesswoman was one of 240 shooters at the
popular Ladies Charity Classic.
   In its third year, the classic has fulfilled its goals of
raising tens of thousands of dollars for a local women's
shelter as well as introducing hundreds of local women to the
sport. Featuring free lessons and available shotguns, the
classic has drawn women for a variety of reasons, including
some who are eager to learn for business as well as pleasure.
   "A lot of women who come to shoot sporting clays are
professional women," said Sue King, a leading organizer of
the classic and a nationally respected sporting-clays shooter
and instructor. "They've discovered that it can really help
them to learn how to shoot. Here in Texas a lot of
corporations will have a bird lease where they'll take
clients and staff hunting. You're also seeing more and more
corporations using sporting-clays courses for business
entertainment."
   And this is a sport in which women easily can compete with
men. "Shooting is the perfect sport for women. There's no
need for brute strength or blazing speed like in most
sports," said Ms. King, whose shooting average is one of the
highest in the nation -- male or female. "It's a matter of
hand-eye coordination and being able to stand in one spot,
swing a shotgun and say `pull.'"
   Many women at the classic said they were learning the
sport to better their family life. "It's getting harder and
harder to find something for the whole family, but sporting
clays is that kind of sport," said Bud Ward, publisher of
Outdoor Life and an avid sporting-clays shooter and promoter.
"It's really a pleasure to go out and simply walk from
station to station. It's also a lot of fun for women and some
children to shoot. At a recent national championship we saw a
lot of 10- to 12-year-old shooters who were really very
good."
   Unlike the not-too-distant past, women and young shooters
are finding it easier and easier to get into the shooting
sports. Ms. King expressed relief that many sporting-goods
companies now are marketing shotguns and shooting clothing
specially designed for women and children.
   Such inexperienced gunners also are finding a growing
amount of information and encouragement in the outdoor media.
Outdoor Life, for example, is publishing a regular
sporting-clays column and a growing number of family-oriented
hunting and fishing articles.
   Those who know the shooting industry realize that getting
women and children involved could be critical to the future
of sport shooting in America. "We think it's extremely
important that we get women, and new shooters in general,
involved in some sort of shooting sport," said Sandy Wood,
shooting promotions manager at Winchester-Olin Corp., the
ammo company that donated the ammunition for the classic.
   "For one thing, women are a major voice in this country,
and the young shooters will be in the future. Anytime you can
get them shooting it tones down some of the hysteria about
gun ownership," said Mr. Wood.
   Outdoor Life publisher Bud Ward agreed, saying, "You can
teach them a lot with just one round of sporting clays. They
quickly learn that shooting and guns can be rewarding as well
as lots of fun. Also, all they have to do is break a few
targets and they're hooked on shooting. It's like eating
popcorn; try it once and you're addicted."
