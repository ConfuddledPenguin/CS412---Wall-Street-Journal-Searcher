   CHINO, Japan -- Megumi Negishi wouldn't have been caught
dead playing golf a few years ago. She is a woman -- and the
links were the domain of middle-aged businessmen known as
"oyaji," or "old boys," for their coarse ways. The
beer-swilling oyaji, dressed in gaudy striped shirts and
tight-fitting polyester trousers, gave Japanese golf a
locker-room tone.
   Things are changing, though. The 24-year-old Ms. Negishi,
wearing bright pink designer golf clothes, now is happy to
shell out 58,000 yen, about $385, for a two-day golf tour. "I
used to think I'd never do things that oyaji did," she says.
"But when I tried it myself, it was fun."

   Many of the newcomers are certainly not obsessive about
their scores. They are more interested in the latest in golf
fashion -- this year, tropical prints with labels such as
"Cute Story." Many of the women, in fact, never make it to a
golf course. They settle for urban driving ranges.
   On a stormy day at the fancy Mitsui no Mori Tateshina Golf
Club, 120 miles from Tokyo, Ms. Negishi is playing her first
round on a real course with a group of women touring with the
Loft Sports Golf School. She began weekly lessons six months
ago. The women are scurrying after their designer golf-balls.
Some of the balls have plopped into ponds, and others have
bounced straight onto the green -- the previous hole's green.
   The women play at less than the speed of divine lightning.
One vows to break 200 in her next round -- nearly three times
par. Ms. Negishi, shielding her outfit under a raincoat and
hat, slices her ball off a tree trunk. A group of men
impatiently pace the fairway behind her, and a caddy pleads
with her to hurry.
   Oyaji say they really welcome women to golf but bemoan
their giggly manner and slow pace. "I wouldn't mind them if
they practice and become good," says Hiroyoshi Sugano, a
38-year-old electric appliance company worker. Still, he
says, if women take up too many pastimes of the old men, they
are going to become old themselves.
   Those pastimes are just what the women are pursuing,
however. Bored with discos and chic bars, young women have
used their rising purchasing power to assert themselves in
the male domain of "out-of-the-ordinary experiences, just
like eating ethnic food, or going to Bali and Tahiti," says
Hikaru Hayashi. She is senior research director at the
Hakuhodo Institute of Life &amp; Living Inc. and a specialist in
youth culture. Young women are joining the oyaji at pachinko
parlors, "karaoke" sing-along bars, and even seedy
horse-racing tracks. The women, mostly single clerks and
secretaries in their 20s, call themselves "oyaji girls."
   Golf appeals to them most. The number of women golfers in
Japan has doubled in the past five years to three million, or
20% of all the golfers in a country that spends $13.3 billion
a year on the game.
   "I'm sick of going to discos," says 23-year-old Mika
Takaara after finishing her round with Ms. Negishi. Ms.
Takaara, who works for a securities company, says, "If
there's something fun to do, we should all do it." In
addition to golf and pinball, her oyaji pastimes include
betting at the track and downing vitamin drinks marketed as
energy fixes for the overworked.
   Clothes-consciousness weighs heavily on the women. Young
skiers here often buy two skiing outfits a season so they
won't always be wearing the same clothing in photographs.
Golf is even more demanding, fashion-wise. "I feel I have to
change my outfit every time I play," says Kumiko Koga, a
23-year-old Tokyo secretary who took up the game a year ago.
   She plays with her company's clients and occasionally even
with her 56-year-old boss, who, she says, encourages her
fashion spending. She has spent as much as $465 on clothes
for a single round of golf. She likes this year's hot colors,
gold and silver, and especially sequins. She saves money by
borrowing her mother's golf clubs, but she recently invested
$865 in a blue golf bag with embroidered figures of Mickey
and Minnie Mouse swinging their clubs.
   All over Japan, golf shops with shelves of pastel balls
and racks of clothing with such labels as "Papas" and "Popo
Club" are opening. Designers offer the oyaji girls slim
leather bags, holding only a few clubs, especially made for
the driving range. New magazines for neophyte women golfers
advise on proper makeup, and advertise gloves that emit a
fragrance when a wearer grips a club. The Kapalua Golf Course
in Hawaii sells its own brand of designer clothes exclusively
in the Japanese market.
   High greens fees, often well above $180 on weekends, give
the sport prestige for those oyaji girls who can afford them.
Other young women swing their clubs only at golf schools on
the rooftops of Tokyo department stores. Still others, like
18-year-old Megumi Sakaguchi, are satisfied with urban
driving ranges. Unlike America's driving ranges, with their
broad swaths of green that stretch for 150 yards or more,
Japan's cramped ranges look like batting cages. Some, draped
with nets as high as 80 feet, are no longer than two tennis
courts.
   The country's 4,500 ranges attracted more than 120 million
customer visits in 1989, compared with 90 million by those
who teed off on courses. Driving at the trendy Meiji Jingu
Gaien Golf Practice Range in Tokyo, where a flashing
electronic board warns of a one-hour, 50-minute wait, Ms.
Sakaguchi admits she has never played on a real course. She
has been practicing for three years.
   Yutsuko Chusonji claims to be the first oyaji girl. She
says she coined the term two years ago when, in the comic
books she writes, she started portraying young women golfers
pretending to be men. The 27-year-old Ms. Chusonji, herself
an avid golfer, says golf is an important status symbol for
young women.
   Not all, however, like being called oyaji girls. Ms. Koga
says she gets upset when middle-aged men on the golf course
ask if she's one. "If you call me an oyaji girl," she warns a
reporter, "I'll cry."
