   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp., in a move that
doubles its size in the growing office-furniture business,
agreed to acquire Knoll International Inc., a closely held
maker and designer of office furniture.
   Terms of the all-stock transaction weren't disclosed.
Industry observers put the value at around $200 million.

   The acquisition, Westinghouse's third in office furniture
in the past two years, increases the company's sales in the
business to about $700 million this year, making it No. 3
behind industry leaders Steelcase Inc. and Herman Miller Inc.
The acquisition is the first under Paul E. Lego, who became
Westinghouse's chairman and chief executive on July 1.
   With the Knoll purchase, Westinghouse takes a big step in
its rapid buildup in the office-furniture industry, a
business in which it was only a bit player until last year.
Like Westinghouse, both Steelcase and Herman Miller have made
a string of acquisitions over the past two years. The
consolidation means that smaller players almost certainly
will have to seek mergers or affiliations with other
companies because distribution channels are being locked up
by the industry leaders.
   In fact, the $8 billion-a-year industry has seen a handful
of players seeking bankruptcy-court protection amid severe
price competition. But Westinghouse officials insist that
office furniture has a big future. They cite statistics
projecting 8% annual growth in the U.S. and even more in
Europe and Japan. And with Knoll, which is based in New York
and whose sales are estimated at $380 million this year,
Westinghouse officials say they are poised to challenge
industry-leader Steelcase.
   "I want us to be much bigger. There's ample room for two
Steelcases," said Maurice Sardi, head of the business group
that includes office furniture, in a recent interview at the
unit's headquarters in Grand Rapids, Mich.
   The furniture business is a stylish departure for a
company that produces power generation equipment such as
giant turbines and handles hazardous wastes. At the Grand
Rapids headquarters, Westinghouse is going all out to woo
potential furniture customers, offering meals whipped up by
in-house chefs. There is an auditorium, complete with
special-effects lighting, moving floors and a funky, Pointer
Sisters-like video demonstration that includes company
employees.
   Westinghouse came to the office-furniture business through
its sales of movable wall partitions. But walls soon became a
commodity product and for the decade beginning in the
mid-1970s, Westinghouse's business slumped at a time when
furniture makers prospered. The company closed excess
capacity and revamped its manufacturing process. Still,
Westinghouse at one point considered selling out because it
had difficulty competing against full-line suppliers such as
Steelcase.
   Westinghouse officials say that partitions now account for
just 30% of office-furniture industry sales. Most customers,
they say, prefer one-stop shopping, ordering chairs and items
such as desks and cabinets along with the walls.
   Last year, Westinghouse broadened its line by acquiring
Reff Inc., a maker of wood furniture based in Toronto, and
Shaw-Walker Co., a furniture distributor and a producer of
chairs, cabinets and assorted furniture based in Muskegon,
Mich.
   For Mr. Lego, Westinghouse's new chairman, the purchase
marks his first step in a plan to expand selected businesses
within the company after a decade of divesting slower growth
businesses. Earlier this week, Mr. Lego was thwarted in
another acquisition effort when Ford Motor Co. selected Loral
Corp. as the winning bidder for Ford's aerospace subsidiary.
Mr. Lego had said he intended to increase Westinghouse's
presence in radar systems.
   The Knoll acquisition enhances Westinghouse's goal of
competing globally in most of its varied business segments.
Knoll has facilities in Milan and Paris and sells its
products throughout Western Europe as well as Canada and the
U.S. Knoll has about 2,800 employees.
   Moreover, Westinghouse plans to eventually tie in its
expertise in worker productivity and communications
electronics to its furniture business. Company officials say
Japanese companies lag far behind their American counterparts
in office productivity. Westinghouse believes there is a
market in exporting advances in office technology to that
country as well as others abroad.
