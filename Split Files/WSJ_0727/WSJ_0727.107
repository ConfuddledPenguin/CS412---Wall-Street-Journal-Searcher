   WASHINGTON -- House and Senate conferees reached an
agreement on comprehensive oil-spill legislation that would
end a 16-year congressional stalemate on the issue.
   Approval of the measure came after the lawmakers agreed to
make vessel owners solely liable for damages resulting from
tanker spills, rather than making cargo owners responsible as
well. The conferees also settled on liability limits that are
significantly higher than those under current law.

   Previously, the conferees agreed to require that all new
tankers be equipped with double hulls and rejected provisions
that would have provided for U.S. participation in an
international treaty limiting shippers' liability in spills.
That action means states are free to set unlimited liability
for shippers or other parties responsible for spills.
   The congressional effort to pass oil-spill legislation
gained momentum after last year's grounding of the Exxon
Valdez in Alaska and a rash of spills in U.S. waters in the
16 months since. Congressional aides said lawmakers hope to
bring the measure to the House and Senate floors for final
approval as early as next week.
   Conservation groups were cheered by approval of the
measure. Clifton Curtis, an oceans specialist for Friends of
the Earth, called the measure an "environmentally strong
bill." The Bush administration and the tanker industry,
however, strongly opposed the rejection of the treaty,
contending that companies will curtail shipments to U.S.
ports rather than face the potential for unlimited liability
under state laws.
   Galen Reser, assistant transportation secretary for
governmental affairs, said "we may live to regret" the
failure to accept the international accord. At the same time,
he said the administration "is pleased that this has come to
a close" and said the transportation secretary probably won't
recommend a presidential veto of the legislation.
   Under the federal liability limits set yesterday, tanker
owners would generally be liable up to $1,200 a gross ton.
Limits under current law are as low as $150 a gross ton,
congressional aides said. Limits also would be established
for accidents involving offshore facilities. Federal cleanup
and damage assessment costs, plus compensation for damages,
beyond the liability limits would be paid from a new $1
billion fund financed by a five-cents-a-barrel tax on
domestic and imported oil. That fee has been collected since
Jan. 1.
   The fund could pay out the full $1 billion for a single
incident, with as much as $500 million going to repair
natural resource damage.
   The fund could be tapped only if the accident doesn't
involve gross or willful negligence. The bill also improves
contingency planning for spills and enhances the Coast
Guard's ability to respond to accidents.
   Before approving the measure yesterday, the lawmakers
added an amendment that would place a moratorium on oil
leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf off North Carolina
until additional environmental studies can be done. The
proposal was offered by Rep. Walter Jones (D., N.C.).
