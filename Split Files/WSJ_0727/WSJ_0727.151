   When Myron Berman says, "We believe in America," it isn't
idle talk.
   Mr. Berman is chairman of Keystone Camera Products Corp.,
a Clifton, N.J., maker of under-$50 cameras. Despite
intensifying competition from imports, a partnership he heads
has invested $14 million in Keystone since early last year,
pledging to keep Keystone's production on U.S. soil.

   "We're going to fight," Mr. Berman says. "We're not going
to throw in the towel."
   In defying global economics and foreign competition, Mr.
Berman isn't alone. Against all odds, a brash band of
entrepreneurs vows to stay all-American in manufacturing even
though almost all of their competitors either are foreigners
or have moved production abroad. These diehards' products are
often the last in their categories with "Made in USA" labels.
   Behind the resistance are several factors besides sheer
cussedness. Some holdouts say the manufacturing methods they
use aren't available elsewhere. Some worry about quality
control in foreign factories or believe a U.S. base allows
them to react quicker to changes in the U.S. market. Others
say remaining U.S.-made can be a big selling point for their
products.
   Nobody seems to know exactly how many holdouts there are,
but authorities think there are dozens or even hundreds.
"There are a significant number of companies like these that
are out on a limb in market sectors once entirely dominated
by American companies," says Christopher Burke, executive
director of Made in the USA Foundation, a Washington
not-for-profit promoter of U.S. products. He adds: "Their
success or failure is an indicator of how American business
will compete in the global market of the 21st century."
   Says Keystone's Mr. Berman: "I have never owned a foreign
car. I'm a career reserve officer in the Army. I believe what
I'm doing is right."
   Even so, an "all-American" strategy is no sure winner, as
Keystone, for one, has learned. Once one of the dominant
producers of focus-free cameras, 70-year-old Keystone now is
besieged by competitors -- including big Eastman Kodak Co. of
Rochester, N.Y., whose cameras are made in Asia with low-paid
labor. Keystone has had to slash prices 25% in the past two
years; in 1989, the company reported a net loss of $4.3
million on $40.5 million in sales, its fifth consecutive year
of red ink. With a negative net worth of nearly $1 million,
Keystone also has violated a covenant for its $16.4 million
in bank debt.
   In March, the troubled company asked the International
Trade Commission, a federal agency, to restrict imports of
budget cameras into the U.S. for five years. Mr. Berman said
such a move would allow Keystone to increase its production
to four million cameras in 1991, from the three million
expected this year. If its plant output improved, Keystone
could sell cameras at import prices and still make a profit.
   But last Tuesday, the commission rejected the company's
petition, saying poor management in the past, and not imports
alone, had caused the company's plight. Mr. Berman still
plans to hire 270 more workers, a 50% increase, to turn out
two new camera models.
   Comdial Corp. had better luck, largely because it won
import protection last December. The Charlottesville, Va.,
company and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the only
other major U.S. maker of small-business phone systems,
persuaded the trade commission to impose anti-dumping duties
on imports from Japan and South Korea. The ruling stabilized
prices, says William Mustain, Comdial's president. Moreover,
Mr. Mustain says, the erratic supply of imports after the
ruling prompted some phone-system dealers to switch to
Comdial.
   The ITC decision, in addition to a restructuring that
reduced Comdial's work force to 600 from 2,500 in 1983, has
helped turn around the company's performance. After five
consecutive years of losses -- in 1989 the company reported a
loss of $1.9 million on sales of $81.4 million -- Comdial
earned $301,000 on sales of $42.1 million in the first half
of this year.
   Even without the government's aid, Mr. Mustain says he has
good reason to stay put in Virginia: With a plant in the
U.S., the company can respond faster to changes in the
market. American companies that manufacture in the Far East
wait six to nine months to take delivery of products. At
Comdial, assembling and delivering a new phone system to U.S.
customers takes three weeks.
   James Davis, president of New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc.,
Boston, fears that turning over production to Asian factories
-- which supply Nike Inc. and his other competitors -- would
compromise quality. New Balance, whose shoes retail for as
much as $150 a pair, says it is the only athletic-shoe
company to make shoes in a variety of widths. Also, with
annual sales of only $120 million, "We're not such a large
company that we can dictate to the factory," Mr. Davis says.
   Robert Wischnia, a senior editor at Runner's World
magazine, says Mr. Davis's fears are unfounded. "I honestly
don't understand why New Balance keeps making their shoes
here," he says.
   Meanwhile, Cannondale Corp.'s incentive to keep making all
of its high-performance bicycles in the U.S. is two-fold. For
one thing, industry people say the Taiwanese plants that
crank out frames for such competitors as Trek Bicycle Corp.
and Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. haven't matched
Cannondale's pioneering techniques for producing lightweight
welded aluminum frames.
   The Georgetown, Conn., company's lightest frame weighs
about a pound less than the lightest steel frames found in
Far Eastern factories. "We had to write the book for the
technology we use," says Cannondale's president, Joe
Montgomery. "There isn't anybody our size doing this kind of
thing."
   Mr. Montgomery also found that his all-American mountain
bikes are a big hit among Europeans; foreign business
accounts for 35% of Cannondale's $40 million in annual sales.
"These people want American products," he says. "
`Made-in-the-USA' is a very important sales tool."
   Lionel Trains Inc. found that out the hard way. Formed in
1986, the Mount Clemens, Mich., company makes the celebrated
brand of toy trains formerly made by General Mills Inc. and
Lionel Corp. (no relation). In recent years, the company's
competitors have shifted production to the Far East. The
latest to switch was MDK Inc., Chapel Hill, N.C. By next
year, virtually all of its manufacturing will take place in
Hong Kong and China. "We can get far better quality than we
can get here at one-third to one-half the price," says Maury
D. Klein, MDK's owner.
   In 1983, Lionel itself decided to relocate production to
low-wage Tijuana, Mexico. But it moved back to Michigan two
years later. The company had not only run into huge
logistical problems supplying trains to dealers, it also
suffered a backlash from patriotic train collectors.
   Now the company swears it is in Michigan to stay. "We are
one of the last companies to make these trains in America,"
says John Brady, Lionel's vice president of marketing. "Maybe
that's reason enough to continue doing it."
