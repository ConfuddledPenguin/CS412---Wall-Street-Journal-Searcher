   In the first sign of hope for tobacco liability
plaintiffs, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled yesterday that
warnings on cigarette packages don't protect tobacco makers
from product liability lawsuits.
   The decision, which was hailed by smoking foes and
plaintiffs' attorneys, opens the door for a review of the
issue by the U.S. Supreme Court. It also marks a sharp break
from previous circuit court rulings. In recent years, five
federal courts and the Minnesota Supreme Court have ruled
that the 1966 federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act
-- which requires warning labels on cigarette packs and in
cigarette advertisements -- protects the tobacco companies
from liability.

   "This is precedent setting," says Marc Edell, the
plaintiff's attorney, who also represented Antonio Cipollone
in another landmark tobacco case last year. "This is the
first time a state supreme court has held that cigarette
warnings don't preclude plaintiffs from suing manufacturers."
   Yesterday's decision stems from a lawsuit filed by Claire
Dewey against Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., American
Brands Inc. and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. in 1982. Her husband,
Wilfred Dewey, died of lung cancer at age 49, after smoking
Camels, Tareytons and Viceroys for 40 years. The New Jersey
Supreme Court ruling allows Mrs. Dewey to proceed with the
product liability case.
   In the 59-page opinion, a majority of the judges found
that Congress didn't intend to "immunize" cigarette
manufacturers against suits alleging that they had failed to
warn consumers of the risks of smoking. If that had been the
intent, Congress "knew how to do so with unmistakable
specificity," the judges said.
   Tobacco analysts played down the significance of the case,
noting that the decision has no immediate financial
implications because Mrs. Dewey has yet to win her case.
Nonetheless, tobacco stocks were buffeted yesterday. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American
Brands closed at $66.25 a share, down $3.625, and Philip
Morris Cos. finished at $47.25 a share, down $1.75. American
depositary receipts of B.A.T Industries, the parent of Brown
&amp; Williamson, fell 12.5 cents, to $10.875 a share, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading. RJ Reynolds is
privately held.
   "This is a psychological negative," said Diana Temple, an
analyst at Salomon Bros. "But it's only one negative decision
in an overwhelmingly positive flow of liability decisions."
Fifty-three cases are pending against the industry, down from
a peak of 157 in 1986.
   Longer term, however, the implications could prove
significant. Two of the three tobacco companies named in the
Dewey suit -- Brown &amp; Williamson and RJ Reynolds -- indicated
they will consider appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Some legal experts said the high court would be likely
to accept the case.
   Even if the tobacco companies accept the Dewey decision,
there are six cases pending in New Jersey or federal court
that would potentially allow plaintiffs to bring the matter
before the Supreme Court.
   A high court ruling against the tobacco industry would
certainly trigger a flood of new tobacco liability suits,
according to some experts. "If the conflict is resolved
against the tobacco industry, this will be very serious,"
predicted Calvert Crary, managing director of Labe Simpson &amp;
Co. in New York. "The plaintiffs will win these kinds of
cases all day long."
   For their part, attorneys who represent the tobacco
industry conceded that the justices in the Dewey case had
departed radically from previous rulings. But Martin London,
an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, summed up the prevailing
sentiment, describing the case as "aberrant." He said the
case isn't precedent setting because federal courts have so
consistently found that the federal warning law protects
tobacco companies.
   "This isn't a chink in the industry's armour because of
its relatively limited applicability," added David Kentoff,
an attorney at the Washington, D.C.-based firm of Arnold &amp;
Porter, which represents Philip Morris. "The decision only
applies to cases brought in state courts in New Jersey."
   In another positive development for tobacco plaintiffs,
the New Jersey justices also held that cases filed before
1987 aren't affected by a state law that makes it more
difficult to file cigarette liability suits. The law shields
tobacco manufacturers from claims that cigarettes are
"defective" products because of their health hazards.
   For smoking critics, the Dewey case is especially welcome
because it comes at a time when tobacco plaintiffs have
suffered a series of crushing defeats. Earlier this year, a
Minnesota court dismissed a similar case against RJ Reynolds,
ruling that the 1966 labeling act preempted claims that
cigarette makers had failed to adequately warn smokers of
health hazards.
   In 1988, a New Jersey jury awarded $400,000 to Mr.
Cipollone, whose wife had died of lung cancer, in the first
defeat for the tobacco industry, but the verdict was later
thrown out by a federal appeals court in Philadelphia.
   "We've been watching one court after another come out with
the wrong decision," said Richard Daynard, chairman of the
tobacco products liability project at Northeastern
University, an anti-smoking activist group. "This is an 11th
hour reprieve for tobacco liability plaintiffs."
