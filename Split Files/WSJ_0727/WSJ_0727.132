   Microsoft Corp., turning up the heat on competitors, is
planning a costly campaign to win a bigger piece of the
market for software that links personal computers.
   The campaign will cost an estimated $40 million in the
year that began July 1, but much of this cost will come out
of the company's plan to increase its work force in the
fiscal year to 8,000 from about 5,600. Analysts also expect
added revenue to cover part of the networking costs, so most
didn't revise earning estimates. Still, Microsoft's stock
fell $2.75 a share in over-the-counter trading yesterday to
$68.75.

   Microsoft is best known for its DOS operating software,
which controls the basic functions of personal computers and
compatibles made by International Business Machines Corp. and
others. But the Redmond, Wash., company covets the market for
networking software, which it considers a "very logical"
extension of its core businesses, said Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft's senior vice president for system software.
   So far, however, Microsoft has offered weak products and
an ineffective and confusing sales effort, leaving Novell
Inc. to garner most of the software dollars spent on
networking PCs. Microsoft's most recent network offering, Lan
Manager, is widely considered to be underpowered. Sales also
were sluggish because Microsoft relied mainly on PC
manufacturers to sell the product.
   When it first began chasing the network business several
years ago, "Microsoft's view was that Lan Manager would take
over the world, that it would sell itself," said Eric A.
Benhamou, chief executive officer at 3Com Corp., which is
marketing Microsoft's networking products, in a recent
interview. "They thought it would be sold in a shrink-wrapped
box. You can't sell (networking) that way."
   Mr. Ballmer, conceding that past efforts have been
disappointing, vowed the company will win a bigger share of
the PC networking business.
   Microsoft's new version of Lan Manager, to be unveiled
Aug. 14 and shipped to customers later next month, is a
decided improvement over the earlier product and "it will put
performance issues to rest," Mr. Ballmer said. The company
also plans to hire about 300 networking sales and supporting
staff and sign up 600 resellers in the U.S. and 400 abroad to
peddle the product. It also plans to spend about $15 million
advertising Lan Manager over the next year.
   "You really get the sense they are serious about going
after Novell," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co.
   Though endowed with great marketing clout because of the
sweep of its products, Microsoft faces stiff competition in
the area of network software. Provo, Utah-based Novell
dominates the market with its Netware family of software and
in recent months has been expanding its traditional base of
resellers to include computer manufacturers, who agree to
bundle Novell's software with their hardware.
   "Novell is entrenched," said Richard Edwards, an analyst
at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. Novell, which had revenue of
$421.8 million in its year ended Oct. 28, is generally
considered to hold about 70% of the market for PC networking
software.
   Because it makes only networking software, Novell believes
it holds a technical edge on Microsoft. "Netware is two years
ahead of Lan Manager," said Darrel Miller, an executive vice
president at Novell.
   Mr. Ballmer disagrees but conceded that with the new Lan
Manager, "I can't say we blow them away."
   Still, on the heels of the Microsoft announcement, Novell
shares fell to $47.875, down $1.375, in over-the-counter
trading.
