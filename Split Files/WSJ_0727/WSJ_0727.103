   UAL Corp., aided by the sale of aircraft, dodged the
second-quarter profit declines posted by Delta Air Lines
yesterday and by other major carriers previously. Meanwhile,
Midway Airlines had a hefty loss compared with a year-earlier
profit.
   Industry earnings have been damped by slower-than-expected
June traffic. Traffic rose only 5.4% systemwide last month
from a year ago, a smaller increase than recorded in earlier
months.

   UAL, in the midst of a proposed union buy-out, said net
income rose to a record $148.3 million, or $6.81 a share,
from $141.1 million, or $6.52 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 8.7% to $2.74 billion from $2.52 billion.
   The profit rise largely reflected a $77.3 million gain,
primarily from the sale of two Boeing Co. 727 jets and seven
McDonnell Douglas Corp. DC-8 aircraft. In the year-ago
quarter, the company had a similar gain of $5 million.
   Excluding the gains, UAL's profit fell an estimated 30% to
$97 million from $138 million a year ago, said Robert Decker,
an airline analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Other carriers couldn't avert the profit decline. Delta's
fiscal fourth-quarter net plunged 60% to $74.1 million, or
$1.47 a share, from $190.8 million, or $3.87 a share, a year
earlier. The decline chiefly reflected fare wars in
California, higher fuel costs and last year's strike at
Eastern Airlines, which helped boost Delta traffic. Eastern
has since resumed most of its flights. Delta's revenue in the
quarter ended June 30 eased to $2.24 billion from $2.31
billion.
   Previously, AMR Corp., parent company of American
Airlines, and USAir Group Inc. reported significantly lower
profits. Besides UAL, only Southwest Airlines has reported a
gain in June-quarter net.
   Midway, based in Chicago, posted a second-quarter loss of
$11.4 million, largely reflecting continued costs at the new
Philadelphia hub of operations. A year ago, net was $5.1
million, or 46 cents a share. Revenue jumped 35% to $170.6
million from $126.5 million.
   Delta appears to have been hit later than its rivals in
the industry downturn. The Atlanta carrier was one of just
two major airlines to post a profit in the previous quarter,
when sharply higher fuel costs hurt carriers. Overall, the
industry had an operating loss of about $650 million in that
quarter, compared with a $179 million profit a year earlier.
Edward Starkman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., estimates
the industry had operating profit of $750 million in the
quarter just ended, down from $980 million a year earlier.
   Fuel prices stabilized in the latest quarter. Delta,
however, felt the effects of an intense fare fight in
California, where it and three other major carriers are
battling for market share. That, plus a limited nationwide
fare promotion that ended in June, shrank Delta's yield, or
profit margin, by 1%. In contrast, United's yields rose 1.3%.
