   SAN FRANCISCO -- Samuel Armacost is moving again.
   Yesterday, Mr. Armacost said he was leaving Merrill Lynch
to become a general partner at New York-based Weiss Peck &amp;
Greer, a closely held investment concern that specializes in
management buy-outs and venture capital, among other things.
Mr. Armacost said he will work out of Weiss Peck &amp; Greer's
office here.

   Mr. Armacost, 51 years old, said he's making the move
because it is a "unique opportunity . . . to work with people
who are friends and for whom I have high regard."
Additionally, he said the position gives him a chance to be
an owner. "I've been a hired management gun in two gigantic
operations," he said. "I think the trend is more toward
boutiques" that specialize in particular areas of finance,
"and I think being an owner will be a lot of fun."
   Mr. Armacost, who, rightly or wrongly, will probably be
forever branded as the man who took BankAmerica Corp. to the
brink of collapse, has been working as managing director for
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets since 1987, when he was forced
out as chief executive officer and president of BankAmerica.
At the time, BankAmerica was suffering from huge losses and
was in danger of failing. It has since recovered.
   Mr. Armacost always maintained that problems he inherited
from his predecessor, A.W. "Tom" Clausen, led to the bank's
later troubles. Mr. Armacost was succeeded by Mr. Clausen.
Though many of the restructuring moves and cost-cutting
measures that helped pull BankAmerica out of the mire were
initiated by Mr. Armacost before he was forced out, Mr.
Clausen now receives much of the credit for saving the bank.
