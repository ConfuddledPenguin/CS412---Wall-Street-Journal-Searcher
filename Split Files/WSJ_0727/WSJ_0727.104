   The 1988 presidential campaign surely marked a new low in
political advertising. Who could forget the face of Willie
Horton, the convicted rapist who starred in a George Bush
commercial attacking Gov. Michael Dukakis for Massachusetts's
prison-furlough program?
   The legacy of 1988's mud-slinging campaign, and the
hyperbolic regional political ads that followed in 1989, is
making itself felt in 1990: Just this year, a number of major
newspapers around the country have started new columns
devoted to fact-checking and critiquing political
commercials. The Washington Post, the Miami Herald, the
Sacramento Bee and the Los Angeles Times are among those now
regularly picking apart ads in what Miami Herald "Ad Watch"
column reporter Martin Merzer calls "a hyperbole watch, a
reality check."

   Some political strategists say the fact-checking columns,
which appear regularly and scrutinize virtually every new
political commercial that comes along, are already changing
the commercials viewers see. "It's made everyone more careful
and more conscientious, even in this organization," says Ray
Strother, a Democratic political consultant. "Anybody who
tells you {the columns} haven't changed the way we operate
this year doesn't understand the business. We are much more
cautious, much more careful."
   Among other things, Mr. Strother says he sent all his
clients a memo two months ago telling them that every flier,
brochure and commercial could and very well might be
scrutinized by the press. Those clients include Nebraska Sen.
James Exon and Rudy Perpich, running for re-election as
governor of Minnesota.
   The columns may even cut down on the number of negative
ads, which had been on the rise throughout the 1980s, Mr.
Strother suggests. He gives the press scrutiny credit, for
example, for the recent Democratic primary in Georgia, where
"not one negative ad was run -- and that's a first." He says
he's considering a negative attack ad for one of his clients,
and that "we'll check and double-check. Before, there was an
expression, `close enough for political advertising.' But
close enough isn't enough anymore."
   Most of the newspaper columns kicked off earlier this
year, coinciding with the start of local gubernatorial or
congressional primaries. "It's probably a reaction to the
1988 presidential campaign, where the feeling was that more
so than any other presidential campaign, the ads were at the
center of what the campaign was about," says Paul Taylor, who
contributes to the Washington Post's "30-Second Politics"
column. Generally, the columns show stills from the
commercials, describe the text and tear apart claims line by
line.
   A Sacramento Bee column, for example, skewers an ad for
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein. The ad
mentions Ms. Feinstein's "innovative plan" to build
affordable housing. The newspaper notes that "the median
housing price in San Francisco remains among the highest in
the nation -- $262,451." The ad says she signed the law
making San Francisco the first major city to divest from
South Africa. The newspaper notes that "she initially
objected to the {law} that finally was adopted."
   A Miami Herald column similarly attacks an ad for Rep.
Bill Nelson, a Florida Democratic gubernatorial hopeful. The
commercial, which portrays him as a legislative leader,
"contains no outright lies, but is tinged with
exaggerations," the newspaper charges. It elaborates: "He
never chaired a major committee in Tallahassee. During 12
years in Congress, he passed only two bills into law. . . ."
   Jay Hakes, Rep. Nelson's campaign manager, says the
columns haven't had any effect on the congressman's ads,
since "we wouldn't make mistakes anyway." But columnists in
California, Florida and Washington all say that since they
started their columns this year, the campaign machines have
been providing voluminous documentation for their
commercials, along with the usual press releases.
   The Washington Post's Mr. Taylor says that when he decided
to review a Michigan gubernatorial race commercial, "in a
24-hour period, I must have gotten 60 to 70 pages of backup
faxed to me, and another 30 pages of contention from the
other side." He adds, "All the political consultants say
they're always careful. I think as the scrutiny gets tougher,
the carefulness gets greater, and maybe the line has moved a
bit. They're very aware of the fact that we're watching."
   How strong an impact the new press coverage has on ads,
though, remains difficult to measure. In California, aside
from a few negative ads -- notably one in which Ms. Feinstein
attacked opponent John Van de Camp's handling of the Hillside
Strangler case while attorney general -- "the primary wasn't
nearly as vicious or as dirty as some of the campaigns have
been around the country this year," says William Endicott,
the Sacramento Bee's capital bureau chief. "We'd like to
think we had some influence in diffusing a lot of {negative
advertising}. Whether we did or not, I don't know."
   The columnists say they aren't crusaders and aren't trying
to change advertising. "My goal is to equip readers with some
ability to evaluate advertising," says John Pancake, state
editor at the Miami Herald. "I'm hoping we'll give people a
little bit better idea of whether this is reliable commentary
or not. You can't ask a 60-second spot any questions."
