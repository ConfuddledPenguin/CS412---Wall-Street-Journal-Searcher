   MILAN -- Montedison S.p.A. and Ferruzzi Agricola
Finanziaria S.p.A., two companies controlled by Italian
agricultural-industrial group Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A.,
both scheduled separate board meetings for today.
   Although there was no indication given about what might be
discussed at the meetings, and a Ferruzzi spokesman declined
to discuss the agenda, it has been rumored in recent months
that Ferruzzi Agricola, which owns 45% of Montedison, was
considering a merger with the chemical group.

   Italian securities regulators yesterday morning suspended
trading in all key issues of the Ferruzzi group, including
Montedison, on the Milan stock market pending an important
announcement. Trading in Montedison was suspended on the New
York Stock Exchange as well.
   The Ferruzzi spokesman said the company had requested that
the Italian securities regulatory agency "take measures to
protect the interests of the market" after Ferruzzi had
learned that "rumors" about any possible decisions by the
boards of Montedison and Ferruzzi Agricola "had reached some
news agencies." The spokesman declined to elaborate.
   Analysts speculated that Ferruzzi Agricola might announce
a public tender offer for the 51.3% of Montedison it doesn't
already own. Ferruzzi Agricola could finance this bid in cash
with the proceeds from the sale, earlier this year, of La
Fondiaria Assicurazioni S.p.A. to Gaic S.p.A., one analyst
with a securities house in London speculated.
   A tender offer to be paid in Ferruzzi Agricola stock isn't
likely, he said, because that would dilute Ferruzzi
Finanziaria shareholding to less than 50%.
   Such a restructuring would turn Montedison into the key
industrial holding company of the Ferruzzi group. It would
then own majority stakes in Eridania, which heads the group's
agro-industrial sector, and its chemical interests.
