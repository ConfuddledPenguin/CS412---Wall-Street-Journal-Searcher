   Cetus Corp. is scheduled to ask a Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel Monday to back its bid for
approval of its first proprietary drug, interleukin-2, or
IL-2, for advanced kidney cancer. It may be an uphill fight.
   It's the moment of truth for the 20-year-old biotechnology
company, which has spent $120 million to develop the drug as
its flagship product. IL-2 has been given to more than 4,000
patients and approved for sale in seven European nations. But
Monday's FDA hearing promises to be its most crucial and
difficult test. At stake are major issues for the company,
the medical community and the biotechnology field.

   For Cetus, which has tallied up $137.6 million in
cumulative losses, IL-2's approval is necessary to become
profitable. The company's only other major product,
gene-ampification technology known as PCR, is licensed to
Roche Holdings Ltd.'s U.S. unit and mainly yields royalties
to Cetus.
   For biotechnology, the IL-2 story is a classic case of the
difficulty of transforming the lab work of synthesizing human
proteins into practical products that work for patients and
that pass scientific and regulatory muster.
   For patients, doctors and regulators, the story rekindles
debate over how drugs are scrutinized, approved and made
accessible to the terminally ill.
   "It's been a real conflicting story," says Nicholoas
Vogelzang, associate professor of medicine at the University
of Chicago. "There is good news and bad news. But my sense is
that IL-2 is crucial for the survival of certain patients
with renal-cell carcinoma. These patients have no other
therapy known to be curative."
   Kidney cancer strikes about 25,000 people a year in the
U.S. and causes about 10,000 deaths. It's curable when caught
early, but it often goes undiagnosed until it has
metastasized and spread to other organs, where treatment
becomes difficult or impossible. While doctors try various
chemotherapy drugs or interferon, no products have been
approved by the FDA for treating such advanced renal-cell
tumors.
   IL-2 itself only helps a fraction of kidney-cancer
patients. Between 10% and 20% of patients may experience a
response with some tumor shrinkage, says Bruce Chabner,
director of the division of cancer treatment at the National
Cancer Institute. Very small numbers -- perhaps less than 5%
-- enjoy a complete remission.
   Thus, Dr. Chabner concludes, "IL-2 is probably a small
improvement, but certainly not an ultimate therapy for the
disease. It is not a major step forward." Compared with 10%
response rates from interferon or other chemotherapy, "it's a
little bit better . . . a reasonable thing to do if you can
take the side effects."
   Side effects of IL-2 include large but temporary
water-weight gains, which stress internal organs and require
the drug to be given in an intensive care unit. A few
patients -- perhaps 1% -- have died of cardiac or pulmonary
complications.
   Dr. Chabner says NCI's view is "we have to look for better
drugs." But in the meantime, "patients should have access to
all possibilities, as long as they know the risks."
   A few take a dimmer view. Charles Moertel, professor of
medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, says IL-2 should
"certainly not" be approved at this time. "If the FDA
approved this drug, they'd be flying in the face of their own
rules and regulations that require improvement in the
duration and quality of life be shown in two randomized
studies," he says. Unless Cetus scientists can come up with
such data, Dr. Moertel argues, IL-2 "must be disapproved."
   Cetus, Emeryville, Calif., won't comment on Dr. Chabner's
figures or on Dr. Moertel's positions, citing the FDA's ban
on prehearing publicity.
   Some Wall Street analysts are cautious on the outlook. The
lack of a large study showing improved survival rates is one
reason Robert Kupor, a biotech analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. in New York, gives the Cetus product a 25% chance of
being turned down this time. Still, he and Denise Gilbert, an
analyst with County NatWest Securities USA, believe it will
be approved, perhaps with restrictions, simply because
there's nothing else.
   While the scientists weigh data and Wall Streeters
calculate the odds, IL-2's fate is most important to such
patients as Eugene Schonfeld. The 47-year-old entrepreneur,
who runs a publishing company in suburban Chicago, has lost
his right kidney and a rib to kidney cancer. "My perspective
is simple," says Mr. Schonfeld, spokesman for the newly
founded National Kidney Cancer Association. "If you've got a
fatal disease, you'd like as many treatment options as
possible. If IL-2 can help, it's rational to want it."
   He says he's lucky, because his tumor hadn't spread to
other organs. "Others aren't so fortunate," he says. "What do
you say to people with metastatic disease? Go home and die?"
   If IL-2 isn't approved, Mr. Schonfeld says his group may
follow the lead of people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and "become very obstreperous." He says that "it's a
shame" because he fears rational discourse would suffer but
that he and others like him have little choice. "Activism in
cancer patients will become more important."
