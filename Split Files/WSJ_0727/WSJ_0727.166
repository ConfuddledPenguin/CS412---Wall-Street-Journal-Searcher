   General Motors Corp. chairman Roger B. Smith, who vowed
for years to drive the first of GM's Saturn small cars off
the assembly line before his retirement, will keep his
promise -- just in time, and in private.
   Saturn confirmed that Mr. Smith is scheduled to go to
Saturn's Spring Hill, Tenn., factory Monday to drive the
first ready-for-sale Saturn car off the line. That's one day
before his scheduled retirement. Incoming GM chairman Robert
C. Stempel and top United Auto Workers union leaders also are
invited. But reporters and camera crews aren't, a Saturn
spokesman said.

   Saturn officials have said they don't want to give away
any details about the new cars, which GM has spent seven
years and $3.5 billion to develop. Privately, some also have
worried that media coverage associating the car with GM and
its chairman could hurt the new GM division's effort to woo
buyers of Japanese cars.
   The fate of the first Saturn car isn't clear. Mr. Smith
told the Nashville Banner he didn't plan to keep it.
   Saturn is expected to begin selling its two-door and
four-door compact cars in late October for $10,000 to
$13,000.
