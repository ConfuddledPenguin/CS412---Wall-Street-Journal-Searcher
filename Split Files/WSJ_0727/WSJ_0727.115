   With the threat of rising taxes, the pitch sounds better
than ever: Buy a "zero-coupon" municipal bond for a fraction
of its face value, stuff it in a drawer, and forget about it.
Then, 15 or 20 years later, when Junior is ready for college
or you're ready to retire, collect the full face amount --
all tax-free.
   What could be simpler? Nothing, if the investment behaves
as planned.

   But some brokers may not tell investors about the risks,
which can turn these seemingly safe, hibernating bonds into
restless bears.
   Unlike regular bonds, zeros pay no interest. Instead,
investors buy them for a fraction of their face value, and
receive the full face amount when the bonds mature. With no
interest payments to reinvest, investors who hold their bonds
until maturity can count on getting a fixed yield.
   Unfortunately, however, most zero-coupon municipal bonds
contain built-in snooze alarms known as "call features."
These allow issuers to call, or redeem, the bonds before the
maturity date. Although investors get back their principal,
as well as the interest that has accrued to that date,
investors lose out on the interest they thought they had
locked in for years.
   Investors can bypass most of the risks of investing in
zero-coupon municipal bonds by buying only non-callable
issues, say the specialists. But to find non-callable bonds,
investors have to be prepared to look harder, and to give up
a little yield, says Mark Donohue, vice president at bond
brokers Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman Inc.
   Still, he says, investors can find high-quality, long-term
non-callable bonds yielding 7% or more, which is the taxable
equivalent of 10.4% for taxpayers in the 33% bracket. One
non-callable issue he likes is the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey zeros of 2009, with a 7.1% yield to maturity.
The bonds are rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A-minus
by Standard &amp; Poor's, which makes them medium
investment-grade securities.
   Investors who don't stick with non-callable bonds face
numerous risks, which brokers may not mention, says Mr.
Donohue. "All too often, call protection has not entered into
the discussion," he says. Then, when the bonds are called,
"It's common to hear hard-luck stories."
   Early calls subject investors to "reinvestment risk,"
which is a fancy way of saying that they have to scramble
around to find an alternative investment. "The last thing you
want to worry about is having to reinvest at a lower rate,"
says Michael Feigeles, vice president of municipal bond
marketing at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   The problem of an early call can be compounded for
investors who paid a "premium" for the bonds. Paying a
premium means paying more than the face value. Since zeros
are sold at a discount to face value, the "face" amount is
the purchase price plus interest compounded semiannually at
the original yield until the time of the call.
   If the bonds are called early, bondholders will get back
the "accreted value," but not the amount they paid above
that. This won't come as a surprise if investors know they're
paying a premium. But many don't. Because of the bond's
discounted price, "you can't just look at it and tell whether
you paid more than its face value," says Mr. Feigeles.
   Investors can't always count on their brokers to steer
them clear of this problem, at least partly because many of
the brokers don't know about it themselves.
   "I had no idea this could happen," says a Seattle-area
broker who asks not to be identified. He says he put one of
his customers in muni zeros, thinking nothing could go wrong.
Only after the bonds were called did he realize he'd sold
them at a premium. "They were AAA-rated, safe . . . and then
the investor lost 20%," says the distressed broker. He says
he plans to repay the customer out of his own pocket.
   To protect themselves, investors should buy zero-coupon
municipal bonds only from brokers who know what they're
doing. Ask what the accreted value is, and whether you're
paying more than that for the bonds, advises Mr. Feigeles.
   The risk of early calls is likely to increase over the
next three years, say municipal bond specialists, because
most of these bonds were issued when interest rates were
higher. When rates fall, issuers call the bonds and refinance
the debt at lower rates.
   In addition, zero munis issued by now-insolvent thrifts
can be called by the federal government -- whether or not the
bonds have call protection features, says Andrew Carron,
director of fixed-income research at First Boston Corp.
   Investors who can't find non-callable, high-quality zero
municipals would be better off sticking with Treasury
zero-coupon bonds, says Mr. Carron. These are backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and are
non-callable. Those bonds currently yield about 8.75% for
20-year maturities, subject to federal, but not to state
taxes.
