   They Start Plumbing the Depths

   Fish don't normally float in toilet bowls until they're
off to meet their Maker.
   But commodes soon may make cozy homes for marine life,
thanks to some ecologically minded officials in Southern
California who want to dump old water-guzzling toilets into
the Pacific Ocean.

   Worried about the state's continuing drought, water
districts have been urging residents to install
ultralow-flush toilets to save water; some districts are even
offering rebates to residents who switch. But that has led to
another environmental dilemma as the older toilets are dumped
into already backed-up landfills.
   So the bureaucrats came up with the idea for toilet-bowl
reefs.
   "Porcelain fixtures are just as good as rock as far as the
fish are concerned. They're funny-shaped devices with lots of
places for them to hide," says John Grant, a marine biologist
with the U.S. Department of Fish and Game, which is
considering proposals from the city of Santa Monica and the
Helix Water District near San Diego to dump toilets into
Santa Monica Bay and off Point Loma, San Diego. He says a
pile of 300 commodes dumped illegally into Santa Monica Bay a
few years ago has become "a great place to dive for
lobsters."
   Harold Ball, president of the Helix Water District, says
toilets would make ideal reefs for the very reason they're
terrible in landfills: "A toilet literally lasts forever. . .
. It's identical material to a dinner plate. When they went
down to the Titanic, they found the dinner plates were in
perfect condition."
   Flush with suggestions for getting rid of old toilets,
Helix Water District is also testing a plan to crush commodes
and use them to fill potholes. Goleta Water District, near
Santa Barbara, which abandoned the idea of a toilet-bowl reef
because of cost and other issues, is using ground-up toilets
as roadbed.
   With artificial reefs already made of sunken ships, old
cars and rubber tires, "I can't see why using those toilets
wouldn't be very acceptable," says James Stewart, a diving
safety officer with Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif.
   Even so, officials are bracing for a swirl of controversy
over their toilet-bowl reefs. "If you look at it
aesthetically, there are some troubling aspects," concedes
Fish and Game's Mr. Grant. Though giant kelp would camouflage
the commodes in a matter of years, "There's still a stigma
attached to a toilet bowl."
