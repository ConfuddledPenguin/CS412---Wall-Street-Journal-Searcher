   TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses
declined 5.2% in the first half of 1990, the Japan Automobile

   A total of 2.9 million units were exported in the latest
six months, compared with 3.06 million units a year earlier.
However, the latest period's result was up 2.7% from the 1989
second half.
