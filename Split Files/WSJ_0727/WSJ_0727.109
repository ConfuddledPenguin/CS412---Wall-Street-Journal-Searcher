   WASHINGTON -- Seven real estate investors were charged in
federal court here with rigging bids at public auctions, some
of which involved property owned by the troubled Department
of Housing and Urban Development, prosecutors said.
   The case is the first ever in which the federal government
has alleged violations of antitrust laws in connection with
bid-rigging at real estate auctions, according to the Justice
Department.

   The seven defendants allegedly agreed not to bid against
each other, enabling them to buy HUD-owned property and other
real estate at artificially low prices, the Justice
Department said. After one defendant bought a property at a
low price, he made payoffs to the others, the government
charged. This activity allegedly began in 1977 and continued
until last year.
   Some of the property involved was auctioned by the
Superior Court here on behalf of people under the court's
protection, such as children and people deemed not legally
competent, prosecutors said. "These victims are among the
most vulnerable citizens of our city," said James Rill, the
Justice Department's antitrust chief.
   The seven men charged were: Eric Baer, George Basiliko,
Frank Gittleson, Douglas Goldsten, Irvin Greenbaum, Robert
Greenbaum and Sidney Spiegel. The defendants couldn't be
reached for comment. The crimes charged carry possible prison
terms and fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
