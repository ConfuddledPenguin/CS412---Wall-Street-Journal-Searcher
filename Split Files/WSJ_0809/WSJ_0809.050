   Hollywood has inspired all sorts of fiction, from
potboilers to apocalyptic satires. Now Elmore Leonard has
written a Hollywood novel that can take its place with the
best of them. "Get Shorty" (Delacorte, 292 pages, $18.95) is
at least the funniest crime thriller ever set among the
hustlers and con artists of the movie colony.
   In Mr. Leonard's Hollywood, everyone used to be someone
else. Chauffeurs turn into film investors. Movie stars were
once struggling bit players. Copywriters and former ingenues
have become studio executives.

   Chili Palmer, the offbeat protagonist in this fast-paced
and cleverly plotted tale, comes to Hollywood with a more
interesting "back story" than most. "Connected" to a mob
family but never a full member or "made guy," the
Brooklyn-born Palmer for years co-ran a quick-loan business
in Miami. His specialty was collecting from slow pays by
staring at them in a certain menacing way and saying simply,
"Look at me."
   As one Hollywood player tells Palmer, "With your
experience, you could always become an agent."
   At first, all Palmer wants is to become even in the books
of the wise guys who took over his former business. He goes
to California to find a very slow pay who skipped Miami with
a great deal of money. Once on the Coast, Palmer agrees to
look up another overdue LA account for a Vegas casino.
   This deadbeat is Harry Zimm, head of ZigZag Productions,
producer of 49 feature motion pictures, including the "Slime
Creatures" series, "Grotesque" and "Grotesque, Part Two." To
Palmer he looks "like a guy who drove a delivery truck or
came to fix your air-conditioning when it quit, a guy with a
tool kit." But Zimm sees himself as a still-viable Hollywood
entity, with a script under option that could make him "an
overnight success after thirty years in the business." All he
needs to get the deal started, he says, is half a million
dollars.
   Palmer, a major moviegoer, can't resist telling Zimm his
own idea for a film, a story drawn from his loan-sharking
experiences. Zimm, in turn, lets Palmer read his precious
property, and the two men become partners of a sort. Chili
Palmer sets about acclimating himself to his new
surroundings: learning what wheels to rent, what lingo to
spout. "If they say it's `for a specialized audience' or it's
`a cast-driven script,'" he reminds himself, "that's a pass .
. . there were a lot of terms you had to learn, as opposed to
the shylock business where all you had to know how to say was
`Give me the . . . money.'"
   Mr. Leonard is no stranger to such encounters. Many of his
books have been bought for films, and he himself has written
several screenplays. (References to various Leonard projects
and associates are hidden throughout "Get Shorty.") The many
industry types who are paraded past for the reader's
enjoyment all look and sound and act like the awful truth.
Especially biting is the portrait of the talented but
pretentious megastar who thwarts more movies than he makes.
   Illusion and reality keep blurring for the characters in
"Get Shorty." Real life is different from the movies, the
hard guys keep telling the screen guys. But everyone has
trouble remembering this. The movie people persist in framing
life through a lens, and the "civilians" can't help inserting
movie scenes into their reality. The author brings these
perceptual problems to a head in some cinematic-style moments
of truth that are at once very amusing and highly effective.
   There is the expected amount of violence in this Elmore
Leonard thriller: several beatings, two abrupt deaths. But
for many LA readers, the most shocking event in the book will
be when a frustrated screenwriter insults a major star during
a studio meeting.

   Some fun is had with an earlier Hollywood era in "As Crime
Goes By" (Bantam, 325 pages, $3.95), a paperback original and
the first in a projected series of period mysteries by Diane
Shah. The year is 1947, and the amateur sleuth is Paris
Chandler, a young female "legman" for a newspaper gossip
columnist.
   Paris is the daughter of a Warners screenwriter and a
former B-movie actress, and also the widow of one of the LA
Times's Chandlers. For the time being (while her late
husband's estate is being contested), she lives in a mansion,
is chauffeured in a 1939 Bentley and works at her former
in-laws' rival paper, the Hearst-owned Examiner.
   When a beautiful starlet who tried to plant a false gossip
item with Paris is murdered, Chandler is drawn into a search
for the killer. She uncovers a whole covey of actresses kept
by a married director, a weekly high-stakes poker game in
which Hollywood honchos are perhaps being fleeced, and a
possible connection between the dead starlet and another
recent murder victim dubbed "The Black Dahlia."
   Paris and her cronies are likable enough, and the mystery
and its resolution are capably handled by Ms. Shah (a former
sports journalist and magazine editor). What's especially
nice though is the evocation of late '40s LA. Except for an
occasional seeming anachronism of slang, the period is
convincingly rendered with a flair that goes beyond research.
It's surprisingly pleasant to be taken back to a time when
people listened to music at 78 rpm, a time when the movies'
main competition was . . . the radio.
