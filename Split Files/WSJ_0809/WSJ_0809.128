   SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Department of Insurance
ordered Safeco Insurance Co. to roll back rates by $41
million and California State Automobile Association by $92
million in a test of the agency's authority under the
Proposition 103 insurance-reform initiative.
   Proposition 103 required the state's property and casualty
insurers to cut rates by 20%. But the state supreme court
subsequently held that any rollbacks couldn't deprive
insurers of a "fair" rate of return. The state insurance
commissioner, Roxani Gillespie, has set that rate at 11.2% in
figuring rollbacks, although the insurance industry is
continuing to challenge that rate in court.

   The department set hearings for Sept. 17 on the proposed
rollbacks for Seattle-based Safeco, and CSAA, which has
offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and both entities
said they would contest the orders. CSAA is nonprofit
motorists' association.
   Proposition 103, in theory, subjects roughly 600 insurers
in the state to rollbacks, but the cuts are expected to be
relatively small because of the state high-court ruling.
