   WASHINGTON -- The Interstate Commerce Commission gave
truckers permission to pass on fuel-cost increases to
shippers more quickly.
   The commission, citing the "sudden and often severe
escalation" in fuel costs because of the Persian Gulf
conflict, gave truckers permission temporarily to raise their
rates with only a three-day notice instead of the usual
seven-day notice.

   "It is obvious," the ICC said, "that motor carriers must
be afforded an improved opportunity to adjust rates, fares
and charges to offset unanticipated fuel expenditures."
   The action was in response to a request by the American
Trucking Associations and other trucking groups, which had
asked the ICC to let truckers raise rates with only a one-day
notice. Kenneth Simonson, an American Trucking Association
economist, said that the group was "happy" with the ICC
action.
   The three-day notice requirement will be in effect until
Sept. 23, the ICC said. The commission took similar action
last January in the face of rapid fuel-cost increases. For a
45-day period, it allowed truckers to raise rates after only
a three-day notice.
