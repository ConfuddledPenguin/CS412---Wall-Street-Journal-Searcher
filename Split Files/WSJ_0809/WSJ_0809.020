   TORONTO -- Yorkton Continental Securities Inc., an
investment dealer based here, said it plans to offer as many
as 2.2 million shares of Galactic Resources Ltd. through the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
   Yorkton said two prospectuses are being prepared, one for
about 1.6 million of the shares in the Vancouver-based gold
mining concern being offered for sale on behalf of various
clients, and the other for the remainder of the shares, to be
sold by a Yorkton unit. It didn't say when the prospectuses
will be available, but noted they will be distributed three
trading days before the stock is available for sale.
