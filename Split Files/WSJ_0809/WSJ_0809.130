   Tokyo stock prices rebounded sharply following a series of
steep declines since Iraq invaded Kuwait a week ago.
   London stocks ended fractionally better in hectic, choppy
trading, as investors assessed the minute-by-minute
developments in the Middle East.

   In Tokyo, after a volatile morning session, stocks rose
steadily in the afternoon encouraged by firming bond prices,
traders said. Both markets responded favorably to reports
that Saudi Arabia had agreed to increase oil output to help
make up for the shortage in world supplies because of the
embargo of Iraqi oil.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues ended Wednesday at
28509.14, up 856.07 points. Thursday morning in Tokyo,
however, stocks fell 247.26 points to 28261.88.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
580 million shares, up from 526.4 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 819 to 173, while 102 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section gained 53.60 points, or 2.62%, to 2100.02.
   The second section index rose 75.06 points, or 1.87%, to
4090.69. Volume in the section was estimated at 14.1 million
shares, in line with 14.4 million shares Tuesday.
   Observers saw Wednesday's sharp advance as a technical
rebound from repeated plunges over the previous five trading
days, during which the Nikkei Index dropped 3382.59 points,
or 10.9%.
   The market opened with more buy orders than sell orders
for the first time since Friday, as overnight stability on
overseas stock markets helped to encourage institutional
buying of oversold large-capital stocks, traders said.
   "Investors regained calmness," compared with Tuesday, when
they sold in panic on the "oil shock," said Takatoshi
Okuyama, general manager of the investment advisory
department at Daiwa Securities. Even discounting the possible
impact of the Iraqi issue on the Japanese economy, stocks had
been oversold, he said.
   Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, said, "We're not overjoyed with Wednesday's
rebound," noting that uncertainty about Persian Gulf tension
hasn't changed.
   "In addition to the fact that Japan has enough oil
reserves, which ensures oil supply in terms of quantity,
Saudi's decision to increase output reduced fear for higher
oil prices," Mr. Murai said.
   "But any reverse move can push back stock prices down," he
said.
   "Both interest rates and oil prices remain high. Investors
who bought {Wednesday} are ready to dump the shares at any
moment," he added.
   A broad range of large-capital shares were targets of
institutional and dealer buying. These interest
rate-sensitive shares had plunged in the past week on
interest rate surges. But institutions such as life insurance
companies decided these shares had neared bottom, traders
said.
   All of the Big Five steel makers climbed above 500 yen
($3.32) Wednesday, with Kawasaki Steel up 32 yen to 514 yen
and Nippon Steel up 41 yen to 531 yen.
   Among shipbuilders, IHI was up 55 yen to 900 yen, while
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained 25 yen to 855 yen.
   Construction shares also advanced. Ohbayashi increased 70
yen to 1410 yen and Shimizu rose 100 yen to 1750 yen.
   Resource shares advanced strongly on rising oil prices.
But the issues finished well below intraday highs as the
report of increased oil production by Saudi Arabia prompted
selling in the afternoon session, traders said.
   Mitsubishi Oil gained 50 yen to 1320 yen.
   Nippon Oil was up 70 yen to 1450 yen. Teikoku Oil, which
owns a natural gas field in Japan, finished at 1820 yen, up
300 yen.
   Meanwhile, "confusion remains extremely high in world
equity markets," said Paul Harrison, a vice president at
Salomon Brothers International in London.
   "Money managers don't have a clear view on how the Middle
East situation will resolve itself over the next days or
weeks. Volatility is expected to remain high with constant
watching of the news tapes for the next five-minute trend,"
he added.
   On balance, the flood of major U.K. corporate news was
reasonably good, traders said, but the impact on the market
was negligible, given the environment in the Persian Gulf.
   Shares opened on a strong footing but were reduced to
losses as war rumors flooded the market. However, stocks were
driven from midafternoon lows on an early burst on Wall
Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
1.7 points to 2237.5. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
edged up 0.1 point to 1748.5. Volume was 429.2 million shares
compared with 497.5 million Tuesday.
   Throughout most of the session, investors awaited remarks
from President Bush on the deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia. These remarks were followed 90 minutes later by news
from Iraq that it is annexing Kuwait.
   The London market initially rose on these comments,
relieved the announcements "weren't of greater magnitude,"
said one trader. However, upon further reflection, some said
the developments thrust the spotlight back to the U.S., which
has said that one of its objectives in the Middle East is to
free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
   Oils stocks did well, with British Petroleum advancing 2
pence to 364 pence ($6.82), Enterprise Oil rising 3 pence to
693 pence, and Shell up 2 pence at 491 pence. Shell and BP
report second-quarter results Thursday.
   Even Ultramar, after reporting net profit slumped 42% to
#36.1 million for the first half, rose. The oil producer and
refiner's shares gained 7 pence to 354 pence.
   Dealers said part of Ladbroke Group's 10-pence fall to 291
pence is a perception that tourists would shy away from using
its Hilton hotels in the Middle East because of the tensions
there, dealers said.
   Standard Chartered gained 14 pence to 402 pence after
reporting pretax profit of #110 million for the first half.
The bank also maintained the dividend at 12.5 pence a share,
after earlier profit warnings.
   Meanwhile, share prices closed lower in most European
cities: Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and
Madrid. Stocks ended higher in Brussels and Milan. South
African gold stocks gained.
   Investors in Asian-Pacific stocks moved to grab bargains,
sparking a turnaround on most of the region's markets. But
analysts noted a lack of commitment among investors, many of
whom seemed ready to sell at any hint of escalation in the
gulf crisis. Stocks closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Wellington, were mixed in Manila, and lower in
Taipei and Seoul.
