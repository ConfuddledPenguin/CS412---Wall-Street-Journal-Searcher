   LONDON -- Increasing tensions in the Persian Gulf sharply
boosted shipping insurance rates for the second time since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Lloyd's of London, a British insurance market, led
world-wide price increases that have boosted some marine and
energy insurance coverage twentyfold since the invasion.
Lloyd's also reduced the time during which it will cover
ships on a standard policy -- which also boosts insurance
costs.

   There has been little new demand for insurance for ships
calling at Persian Gulf ports since hostilities broke out,
London brokers say. This appears to stem more from the risks
of attack than from rising costs. Nevertheless, a material
increase in the cost of insurance will surely be cited by oil
companies as a reason for higher gasoline prices.
   As tensions escalated, Lloyd's said its underwriters began
charging an additional war-risk premium of 0.25% of the
insured value of ships entering Persian Gulf waters. That
price is 10 times the previous rate, set after the invasion.
Moreover, Lloyd's brokers will charge the rate for a
seven-day period, compared with a 14-day period previously.
   The new rate means owners of a ship valued at $20 million,
a typical value for a supertanker, will pay an additional
$50,000 for Persian Gulf coverage. Shipowners previously were
paying about $10,000 for a full year's coverage.
   For ships going to Kuwait, Iraq and northern ports in
Saudi Arabia, Lloyd's underwriters are charging 1% of the
insured value, up from 0.5%. Cargo rates also are rising.
