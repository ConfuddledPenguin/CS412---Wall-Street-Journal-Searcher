   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
expected next week to consider raising the premiums paid by
banks into the fund that backs up their deposits.
   Amid all the controversy over the savings and loan crisis,
in which taxpayers will be called on to pay at least $150
billion to cover the insolvent insurance fund for thrift
institutions, the adequacy of the fund for banks has also
raised some concern.

   FDIC officials have said they expect the bank fund could
suffer a loss this year as big as $2 billion, which would
reduce the fund to about $11.2 billion. The fund backs up
about $2 trillion in insured deposits at the nation's banks.
   The FDIC's chairman, William Seidman, said he has asked
the FDIC staff to review the agency's financial outlook for
1990 and 1991 to determine whether a premium increase may be
necessary. Depending on the outcome of the review, the
increase would be considered and possibly voted on at a
Tuesday FDIC board meeting, Mr. Seidman said.
   The FDIC chief said he hadn't yet decided whether he
believed the premiums should be increased. But his comments
suggested that a boost may be in the offing.
   "It's a judgment matter and we'll be discussing it," Mr.
Seidman said. "If the indications are that the fund will be
reaching all-time lows and we have concerns about what we
might be facing, we'd have to do everything we could to
increase our resources."
   The bank premiums have already been nearly doubled by the
S&amp;L bailout law, signed by President Bush a year ago today.
That law raised the annual premiums from 8.3 cents per $100
of deposits to 12 cents this year and 15 cents in 1991.
   The law also gave the FDIC the power to raise premiums on
its own, but not more than 7.5 cents in any one year. Thus
the FDIC could raise the premiums as high as 19.5 cents per
$100 of deposits next year.
   Just last week, Mr. Seidman told the Senate Banking
Committee that the $13.2 billion currently in the fund
translates to about 70 cents for each $100 of insured
deposits, the lowest level in "modern history," he said.
While the FDIC believes $1.25 for each $100 is a healthy
level, a $2 billion loss this year would drop the fund to
about 60 cents per $100.
   "Some of the statements I've been making could be said to
be paving the way {for a premium increase} if our review
shows it's necessary," Mr. Seidman said. He has also said he
believes the FDIC fund is sufficient to handle the banking
industry's problems without taxpayer funds, disputing
assertions by some outside analysts.
   Other factors would seem to suggest that the FDIC will
have to raise premiums. Recent statistics point to a slowing
economy, and the oil price hikes following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait add to the threat that the economy could tumble into a
recession. Moreover, real estate values in many areas of the
country are weakening just as banks are finishing a binge of
real estate lending. All these ingredients could produce more
bank failures for the FDIC to handle.
   Premium income this year is expected to be just over $3
billion, said John Bovenzi, a top aide to Mr. Seidman. Next
year's increase to 15 cents would bring in another $750
million, because each one cent increase generates about $250
million in premiums for the FDIC.
   Troubles in the banking industry, particularly in Texas
and the rest of the Southwest, over the past few years have
depleted the strength of the bank fund. In the past two years
it has suffered the first losses in its history: $4.24
billion in 1988 and $851 million last year.
