   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is trying to think
up ways it can quickly curb Americans' big appetite for
imported oil without appearing to look like the Carter
administration.
   The Energy Department is brainstorming on a laundry list
of proposals for conserving energy, increasing domestic
production and switching fuels that is a far cry from the
Carter days of thermostat controls and crash programs to
build synthetic-energy plants.

   "Americans everywhere must do their part," President Bush
said yesterday, plugging energy conservation in his televised
explanation of why he's sending troops to defend oil-rich
Saudi Arabia.
   The proposals, which are still undergoing changes but
could be sent to the president's desk later this week, reject
the concept of new regulations, gasoline-rationing plans or
price controls. Instead, they focus on ways to remove
barriers to production and rely more on carrots than sticks
in encouraging energy conservation.
   One of the most controversial ideas on the list is
dropping the speed limit back down to 55 miles per hour,
which would save 100,000 barrels of oil a day. The
administration isn't endorsing the idea, an Energy Department
official said, but wants to present all options and leave it
up to the White House to decide what's politically feasible.
   In the end, it also will be up to the White House to
decide whether there's enough of an energy shortfall to issue
a national call for more conservation and domestic
production, similar to President Carter's famous cardigan
sweater address in which he called the 1979 energy crisis the
"moral equivalent of war."
   Another measure would encourage fuel-switching by
industries; estimates are it could replace 160,000 barrels of
imported oil a day. Higher prices have already begun to
persuade industries, many of which adopted dual-fuel capacity
after previous energy crises, to switch from oil to more
plentiful natural gas. Energy Department officials said they
are trying to identify ways to remove barriers, such as
transportation problems, that could inhibit fuel-switching.
   Simply asking Americans to inflate their car tires to
manufacturers' specifications could save 70,000 to 90,000
barrels a day. Other advice is: don't top off gasoline tanks,
double up on car trips, and drive the more efficient car if
there's a choice.
   "There are a number of things that could be done that
don't impair people's lifestyle, but if we did enough of them
it would make a difference," said Linda Stuntz, deputy
undersecretary of energy for policy. "It sounds almost hokey,
but it really could make a difference."
   On the production side, the Energy Department is
considering ways to boost sagging domestic output, including
asking states to delay or relax specific environmental and
drilling regulations that reduce production for the duration
of a shortage, said Ms. Stuntz.
   Department officials in particular are studying the new
$2.5 billion Point Arguello oil-drilling project off the
coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. The project's three drilling
platforms, built by a consortium led by Chevron Corp.'s
Chevron U.S.A. Inc., are ready to pump as much as 100,000
barrels of oil a day, but the company can't get the oil to
shore because it can't get state and local permission to
build a pipeline or use tankers because of environmental
concerns.
   Ms. Stuntz said ways are being explored to try to free up
the production, including perhaps involving the Coast Guard
in ensuring the safety of tankers. "We're trying to turn over
every rock we can find. There aren't that many places where
there's that much production virtually available at the turn
of the tap."
   The department hasn't yet totaled how much imported oil
could be offset by the measures it has in mind. The list is
still subject to review by Energy Secretary James Watkins
before going to the White House.
