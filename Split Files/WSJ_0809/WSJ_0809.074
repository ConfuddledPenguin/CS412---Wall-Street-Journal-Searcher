   Halfway through a concert by the folk music duo Buskin &amp;
Batteau -- after they croon "The Boy With the Violin," "When
I Need You Most of All" and "I'd Rather Be in Love" -- the
pair treats the audience to an unusual medley.
   The tunes, which they composed or co-wrote, are familiar
to anyone who has seen or heard television and radio
commercials for some of America's best-known products: "Can't
Beat the Feeling," "The Heartbeat of America" and "Just for
the Taste of It," among others.

   David Buskin and Robin Batteau are folk singers at heart,
but that isn't how they earned the bulk of their living.
Along with their partner Susan Hamilton, they are one of the
most successful commercial jingle-writing teams on Madison
Avenue.
   Their company, HB&amp;B Productions Inc., was responsible for
some catchy, if sometimes annoying, commercial tunes for such
products as Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Chevrolet, Cadillac,
Cheerios, Burger King and McDonald's.
   But after 18 months, the partners called it quits and
disbanded the company Aug. 1. Even though they made a pile of
money from writing jingles -- more than they could ever have
hoped to earn as the proverbial starving folk artists -- they
instead want to pursue writing musical compositions that last
more than, say, 30 seconds.
   Mr. Buskin, 46 years old, says he plans to concentrate on
concerts with Mr. Batteau and writing songs for other
recording artists, including Judy Collins. Mr. Batteau, 42,
says he will perform concerts but he also wants to continue
writing jingles, for Crushing Enterprises Inc., another New
York jingle-writing company that he previously worked with.
Ms. Hamilton, a 20-year veteran of jingle writing and a
Fulbright scholar, is moving to Los Angeles to produce albums
and write songs.
   HB&amp;B was formed to integrate the trio's various
businesses, including songwriting and jingles, as well as
producing records and concerts. "But it never worked out that
way," says Ms. Hamilton. "We spent all our time writing
jingles." Her own company, HEA ("it stands for Hamilton et
al.," she says) will remain in business, in part to write
jingles.
   "The wages are a lot better than folk singing," admits Mr.
Buskin, whose first successful stab at jingle writing was the
"Just Watch Us Now" campaign for National Broadcasting Co. in
1984.
   "But the more accounts we kept winning, the less time we
had time to concentrate on our first love, which was the
music and the concerts," he continues. "We started turning
down gigs because we were exhausted from jingle writing. The
advertising business became a sponge for every available
moment of free time."
   Mr. Batteau sounds like a throwback to the '60s' values.
"We wanted to be able to concentrate on the art of
songwriting, as well as the craft," he says. "We're proud of
our jingles, but we're moved by our songs."
   The duo Buskin &amp; Batteau have performed in clubs, such as
New York's Bottom Line, and on college campuses since 1979.
After five albums and only moderate success on the folk-music
trail, Mr. Buskin turned to jingles to make money. "It was at
a low point in my life," he says. "I was nearly broke. I
noticed some of my friends who wrote jingles had houses in
Connecticut and that was attractive." Mr. Buskin, it should
be noted, now has a house in Connecticut.
   While Mr. Buskin was racking up jingles, such as "All
Aboard America" for Amtrak and "We Deliver, We Deliver" for
the U.S. Postal Service, Mr. Batteau was reluctant to join
his partner.
   "I'm a kid of the '60s," says Mr. Batteau. "I didn't want
to get corrupted or feel like I was sleeping with the
capitalist enemies. Also, I didn't want to fail at it. It
took some years of trying to make ends meet before I decided
to give it a shot."
   After several failed attempts, Mr. Batteau's first success
in jingle writing came with the airliner BWIA International,
owned by Trinidad &amp; Tobago Airways Corp. in Trinidad. "And
then nothing," he says. "I came in second in a lot of
competitions for about a year. I admit I was getting a bit
jealous of David." But then Mr. Batteau won an assignment for
the "Unsinkable Taste of Cheerios" jingle.
   His most famous jingle remains "The Heartbeat of America"
for Chevrolet. It was written in 1986 and remains on the air.
"It was written in about five minutes and easily put me on
the map," says Mr. Batteau, who sounds amazed at his own
accomplishment.
   But the allure of jingle writing has ebbed for Messrs.
Buskin and Batteau. Not only do they want to spend more time
on songwriting and concerts but on political activities as
well. They are involved with the late singer Harry Chapin's
World Hunger Year project, for instance. They also wrote the
theme song for the New York City mayoral campaign of David N.
Dinkins, "City of Cities."
   With the pressure of jingle writing lessening, Buskin &amp;
Batteau are returning to writing songs and performing, most
recently with Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie in Washington last
Friday. They also co-wrote about half of the tunes on Judy
Collins's new album, which has the working title "Fires of
Eden" and is scheduled to be released next month.
   Buskin &amp; Batteau are proud of their jingles and, in fact,
look forward to their performance of the medley in concert.
Apparently, so does the audience.
   "It's funny," says Mr. Batteau, "these commercials, like
Diet Coke, get booed when they show up before a movie in a
theater. But when we do them, they get cheered."

   Trimedia Buys GGK
                                                                                                       

   Trimedia Communications AG, a Zurich-based public
relations holding company, acquired GGK Group, the Swiss
ad-agency holding company that owns New York's Lois/GGK.
Terms weren't given.
   A newly formed holding company will be led by Al Hirzel
and Paul Kluegl, Trimedia's founders, along with Paul
Gredinger, who had previously owned GGK. The new holding
company, which will remain private, will hold 100% of GGK and
65% of Trimedia.
   The company said it is merging the two networks in a bid
to "become one of the major European integrated
communications consultancies."
   Lois/GGK, headed by high-profile ad man George Lois, has
offices in Chicago and New York with total billings of about
$190 million. The shop creates ads for Alberto-Culver Co.,
Time magazine and No Excuses jeans.

   YELLOWHAMMER: D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles confirmed it
is holding acquisition discussions with Yellowhammer PLC, a
financially troubled British ad agency with billings of about
#70 million ($131 million). Yellowhammer, which faltered
recently following an overambitious expansion plan, has been
in receivership and is trying to put together a rescue plan.
The agency's clients include Barclays Bank and Fiat. If an
agreement is reached, DMB&amp;B's London office would purchase
Yellowhammer.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: John Breuner Co., a San Ramon, Calif.-based

Rubicam.
                                                                                                       

   KETCHUM: Ketchum Communications opened an ad agency in
