   NEW YORK -- Frank Lorenzo, who seized on deregulation to
build one of the nation's largest airline companies in a
series of controversial mergers, is leaving the industry that
he helped transform.
   Beaten by waves of bad publicity that have swept his
latest endeavors, Mr. Lorenzo is expected to announce as
early as today that he is selling most of his stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. (formerly Texas Air Corp.)
to Scandinavian Airlines System and stepping down as chairman
and chief executive officer, say people with knowledge of the
proposed move.

   Under the agreement, Mr. Lorenzo would walk away with at
least $17 million, a large sum but a fraction of what he was
worth when his airlines were flying high. Industry sources
say he didn't want to sell his stake, but believed his
continued association with the company, and criticism of his
operating style, were hurting Continental's hopes for
recovery.
   Mr. Lorenzo has been a pioneer in the post-deregulation
airline industry, helping lead the way in merging carriers,
cutting fares and using bankruptcy protection to reorganize
and break up high-cost airlines. But his innovations brought
on debilitating labor strife, crippling debt loads and
another feature of the modern-day airline industry: service
problems.
   Now Mr. Lorenzo's latest airline deal appears to be his
last, at least for years to come. The proposed purchase would
raise SAS's interest in Continental Holdings to 16.8% in
terms of equity and 18.4% in terms of voting control. SAS
already owns 9.8% of Continental Holdings, and has a seat on
the company's board.
   SAS is said to be spending about $50 million on the
transaction, and is planning to install Hollis Harris, 58,
the president of Delta Air Lines, as president and CEO of
both Continental Holdings and Continental Airlines. Jan
Carlzon, SAS's chairman and a Continental director, would
become nonexecutive chairman of Continental Holdings. The
transaction requires approval from the U.S. Department of
Transportation but doesn't violate laws governing how big a
piece a foreign carrier may own of a U.S. airline. That limit
currently is 25%.
   A Continental spokesman declined to comment on the
proposed transaction. Lars Bergvall, SAS's chief operating
officer, said he had no comment.
   Under the agreement, SAS will buy out Mr. Lorenzo's
five-year employment contract, which calls for a base salary
of $365,000 a year plus bonuses and deferred compensation of
at least $570,000. SAS is also buying all the shares of Jet
Capital Corp., a personal investment company owned by Mr.
Lorenzo and two other investors, who are selling their stakes
as well. Jet Capital's chief investment is in Continental
Holdings shares. Since there is no public market for Jet
Capital shares, their value lies in the voting power they
exert over Continental Holdings.
   Finally, SAS plans to purchase, at a premium, Mr.
Lorenzo's options to buy two million or more Continental
Holdings shares. Mr. Lorenzo will retain some of those
options and will remain on the board of directors. Under a
non-compete clause in his employment contract, Mr. Lorenzo is
obliged to stay out of the airline business for at least
seven years.
   The transaction has already received approval from the
board of Continental Holdings, sources familiar with the
transaction say.
   SAS is paying $14 a share for 2.25 million Continental
Holdings shares, almost all of which come from Mr. Lorenzo
and his two Jet Capital partners. That price is sure to sting
other common holders who have watched Continental Holdings
shares slide to yesterday's close of $4.50 a share on the
American Stock Exchange, down from about $23 a year ago. SAS
apparently chose to pay the premium in order to get the
additional voting rights that Jet Capital holds. There are
about 40 million Continental Holdings shares outstanding.
   Controversy is certainly nothing new to Mr. Lorenzo where
airlines are concerned. Over the last three years, the
50-year-old executive has been routinely vilified by Eastern
Airlines unions as they mounted a tough campaign to fight his
attempts to lower labor costs at that former unit. The result
was a bruising strike begun in March 1989 that virtually
grounded Eastern and sent that carrier careening into Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings, from which it still hasn't
emerged.
   Last April, the bankruptcy court judge, Burton R. Lifland,
took control of Eastern from Mr. Lorenzo, placing the carrier
in the hands of a trustee, Martin Shugrue Jr.
   That entire episode so demoralized the Texas Air empire
that it sought to distance itself from its past, changing its
name and severing all ties to Eastern. The body blows from
the Eastern affair also led to Mr. Lorenzo's decision to
leave the airline business, according to people who know him.
   The Eastern episode, which included critical headlines and
pickets outside Mr. Lorenzo's exclusive River Oaks home in
Houston, took a considerable toll on the intensely private
man and his family. He took to hiring bodyguards.
   That was in marked contrast to the Frank Lorenzo who
wrested control of Continental in 1982 in the nation's first
hostile takeover of an airline. Mr. Lorenzo, a graduate of
Harvard University's business school, had been looking for
ways to expand his Texas International Airlines, a small
regional carrier. At the time, Continental was a staid
carrier and money-loser.
   Within four years, Mr. Lorenzo had thrust the airline into
bankruptcy court, abrogated its union contracts and lowered
labor costs. He built back its operations until, in 1986, it
emerged from Chapter 11 protection having turned a profit.
   With low costs, Continental lured flyers by offering lower
fares, and a new generation of travelers took to the skies.
   But the growth of Continental itself has been anything but
steady, and Mr. Lorenzo discovered it was easier to build an
airline than to run it. Continental's top management has been
in constant turmoil, with seven chief executives in as many
years.
   But that didn't stop the acquisition-minded Mr. Lorenzo.
Riding high on deregulation, he and his Texas Air Corp. went
on to acquire People Express and Frontier and Eastern, all of
which were financially troubled. Texas Air already owned New
York Air. In 1987, Mr. Lorenzo folded all the airlines,
except for Eastern, into Continental, a merger that became
one of the airline industry's most difficult and costly.
   Continental's expansion, funded by junk bonds, was driven
by an ever-growing mound of debt, and was shaky at best. With
his new holdings, Mr. Lorenzo's empire -- briefly the largest
airline in the free world -- began to feel the full weight of
its debt: Texas Air rolled up . . . the airline industry's
largest losses ever in 1988 and 1989 -- $718.6 million and
$885.6 million, respectively.
   Mr. Lorenzo eventually broke the strike at Eastern, but
lost the airline. The labor action, mounted by Eastern's
machinists and supported by flight attendants and pilots, not
only forced Eastern into Chapter 11 protection but kept Mr.
Lorenzo in the spotlight: Angry strikers picketed the
nation's airports, handing out buttons and bumper stickers
emblazoned with the words, "Stop Lorenzo."
   But unlike his experience with Continental, Mr. Lorenzo
would not ride Eastern out of bankruptcy. After listening to
ever-smaller offers of repayment, Eastern's creditors ousted
Mr. Lorenzo and Texas Air from day-to-day control of Eastern.
   Texas Air changed its name to Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc. in June. But the parent still is on the hook
for Eastern's pension debt, which could total nearly half a
billion dollars. While Continental has made a dramatic
financial turnaround from last year and the year before, much
of its net income comes from one-time gains such as lawsuit
settlements and asset sales. Its debt service costs remain
high, and eat up much of its operating profits.
   For its part, SAS is 50% owned by the governments of
Sweden, Denmark and Norway. SAS's initial purchase of a 10%
stake in Continental, as well as a marketing agreement with
the carrier back in October 1988, has yielded many benefits.
Passenger traffic between May and December 1989 was up 40%
out of Stockholm and 100% out of Oslo, mostly because of
transfers at Continental's Newark hub.
   The company in recent years has undertaken a broad
expansion program, of which Continental is just a part.
   It now has equity stakes in Inter-Continental Hotels Corp.
(40%), Finnair (estimated 6%) and Swissair (5% to 10%, to be
finalized by the end of 1991). It bought a 24.9% stake in
Airlines of Britain PLC and 35% in LAN Chile. SAS also is in
the market for as many as 126 new MD-90s or A-320/A-321s
airplanes.
   Like other European carriers in highwage home markets, SAS
is having problems with costs. SAS has a hiring freeze and
has sold some ancillary businesses. Now its ambitious
expansion plans are being scaled back. Lars Bergvall, the
chief operating officer, said planned additions to the
airline's New York, Seattle and Los Angeles routes will be
scrapped, as will some other proposed route additions. SAS
has frozen its European fleet at its current size, and three
DC-9s are being sold earlier than planned.
