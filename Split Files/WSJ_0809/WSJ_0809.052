   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury is having trouble tracking down
the tens of billions of dollars of investments that Kuwait
holds in the U.S., but expects to issue regulations for these
frozen assets soon, according to an administration official.
   The regulations will lay down codes of conduct for the
treatment of these assets, which along with Iraqi investments
in the U.S. were frozen by President Bush following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.

   Kuwait is estimated to hold about $50 billion of assets in
the U.S., according to David Mizrahi, editor and publisher of
MidEast Report, a New York-based newsletter that tracks Arab
investments in the U.S. These are mainly held in real estate,
stocks and bonds, he says, adding that Kuwait's investment in
oil refiner Santa Fe International probably ranks among the
largest Kuwaiti holdings in the U.S.
   The Treasury -- for the time being, at least -- declines
to quantify Kuwait's investments in the U.S. In a recent
briefing, Richard Newcomb, the department's director of
foreign assets control, would only say they are
"significant."
   Iraq, in contrast to Kuwait, has relatively small
investments in the U.S., probably a few hundred million
dollars or less.
   One of the reasons that Kuwaiti investments may be hard
for the Treasury to track is because the country and its
citizens, in common with many rich Arabs, have generally
preferred discreet and low-profile investments in the U.S.,
bankers familiar with Kuwait's investment strategy say.
Kuwait has generally avoided shareholdings of more than 5% in
publicly quoted companies in order to avoid the requirement
to disclose holdings.
   Kuwait's desire to build up an international oil
exploration and refining business seems to be the exception
to that general rule. A Commerce Department report on foreign
direct investment in the U.S. for 1988 lists only one Kuwaiti
investment in the U.S. for that year: the $28.6 million
acquisition of Exploration Co. of Louisiana Inc. by the
Kuwaiti government.
   In the mid-1970s then-Treasury Secretary William Simon
agreed that rich Middle East nations wouldn't be subject to
public country-by-country breakdowns of their investments in
the U.S., according to Mr. Mizrahi. But Mr. Mizrahi contends
that such breakdowns have been kept confidentially by the
Treasury.
   Meanwhile, the administration recently set out its policy
to Kuwaiti banks in a letter dated Aug. 5 from the Treasury's
Mr. Newcomb to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Mr. Newcomb's letter sets out four categories of Kuwaiti
banks. The first comprises banks that are considered "blocked
entities" that can't make transactions with persons under
U.S. jurisdiction. They include Bank of Kuwait and the Middle
East, Burgan Bank, Central Bank of Kuwait, Credit de Bergues,
Kuwait Finance House and Savings and Credit Bank. Also
blocked are banks over which Kuwait is deemed to have "de
facto control" -- Al-Ahli Bank, Commercial Bank of Kuwait,
Industrial Bank of Kuwait and Gulf Bank.
   There are also five banks with some Kuwaiti government
ownership; these institutions' transactions will be
authorized pending a final determination by Aug. 18. Another
category is made up of 11 banks that Mr. Newcomb's letter
says "shouldn't be considered" blocked entities but on which
the department is seeking more information by Aug. 18.
