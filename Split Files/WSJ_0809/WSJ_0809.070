   With regard to "Folklore and Furnace: A Tale of Two NEA
Grantees," Leisure &amp; Arts, July 24, I had two reactions.
   The first is that being a large employer in an area is a
strange justification for an arts grant. Perhaps Appalshop
Roadside Theater, with an annual budget of $1.6 million and
37 employees, might just as appropriately qualify for
assistance under state or federal small-business assistance
programs, but it might have to meet some minimum criteria
that NEA recipients don't have to meet -- like being
self-supporting after having received subsidies for 20 years.

   The second reaction is that I am glad Franklin Furnace
Archives Inc. was able to raise $17,000 from willing
contributors. Surely it is better for society overall that
contributions to the arts be voluntary rather than coerced. I
find it disturbing that it is considered a fair exchange that
money I have worked to earn and pay taxes with is considered
well spent if it pays someone to smear chocolate syrup on
herself in public. And I am baffled that while I can go to
jail for not paying my federal income taxes, someone gets
tax-free money from the government to behave in ways that I
attempt to prohibit my six-year-old from doing in his own
home. (His actions, just as Karen Finley's, also must be seen
in context to be understood.)
   The issue is not obscenity -- the issue is that the
federal government (or any government) should spend tax money
on things that are at least as important and serious to
society as a whole as the efforts the government expends in
raising funds to pay for such expenditures.
