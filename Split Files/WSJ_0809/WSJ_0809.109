   Thorn EMI PLC, a British music, home-appliance rental and
lighting group based in London, said it has reached terms to
acquire Filmtrax PLC and its U.S. subsidiary Filmtrax
Copyright Holdings PLC, for as much as $115 million.
   The acquisition of the music publisher will be in cash,
loan stock or new Thorn shares, it said. Details depend on a
review of Filmtrax's financial status. Thorn said the sale
should be completed in three months.

   Filmtrax will be incorporated into Thorn's New York-based
music publishing subsidiary, EMI Music Publishing Worldwide.
   The final purchase price could change slightly depending
on the outcome of due diligence investigations of Filmtrax's
accounts and catalogs, he said.
   Following the announcement Thorn's shares dropped 11 pence
to 683 pence.
