   CHICAGO -- Corn futures prices drifted lower on traders'
expectations of an increase in the government's crop
estimate, which is to be released after the close of trading
today.
   Prices were also depressed by one commodity firm's
prediction of a cut in grain exports to the Soviet Union
during the next crop year.

   Soybean futures prices also declined, but wheat futures
prices rebounded slightly as traders bought contracts to
offset those sold earlier.
   The government report, for July, is expected to predict an
increased corn crop this year based on "optimal growing
conditions" across much of the Corn Belt, said Richard Loewy,
president of AgResource Co., Chicago. He expects the
government figures to predict a corn crop of nearly 7.89
billion bushels, up from June's estimate of 7.85 billion
bushels. Crop yield should hover near the record of 119.8
bushels an acre, he said.
   Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago, predicted the July estimate could be as high
as eight billion bushels.
   A report from Sparks Commodities Inc. in Memphis, Tenn.,
that predicted lower grain exports to the Soviet Union in the
1990-91 crop year beginning Oct. 1 also depressed prices,
traders said. Sparks predicted that based on a bountiful
domestic grain harvest this season of about 218 million
metric tons, the Soviets may slash grain imports by more than
20% to about 28 million metric tons in the 1990-91 crop year.
By the end of the current crop year, the Soviets will have
imported nearly 36 million metric tons of grain, most futures
analysts estimate.
   Sparks officials declined to comment on the report.
   Some traders took issue with the Sparks figures, arguing
that the company was overestimating the Soviets' ability to
harvest their crop in light of widespread reports of fuel and
spare part shortages for combines and other Soviet farm
machinery.
   Soviet crop estimates are even more optimistic than that
of Sparks, "but they're throwing in carrots, peas and lettuce
too," quipped one futures trader.
   Corn futures for December delivery dipped 2.5 cents a
bushel to close at $2.4675.
   Soybeans also benefited from the good growing conditions
in most regions last month, although heavy rains earlier in
the year delayed planting and have resulted in a relatively
immature crop for this point in the growing season. Analysts'
soybean crop estimates ranged from 1.83 billion bushels to
1.842 billion bushels.
   The wet weather also resulted in only 58 million acres
being planted in soybeans this year, the lowest level since
1976, Mr. Loewy said.
   November soybean futures prices slid two cents a bushel to
close at $6.0725.
   The government report is expected to show that a bountiful
wheat harvest in the crop year ended May 30 boosted year-end
stockpiles by about 100 million bushels to more than 900
million bushels, analysts said. That compares with
year-earlier stockpiles of 530 million bushels.
   While such a sharp increase in wheat supplies would be
expected to depress futures prices, December wheat on the
Chicago Board of Trade gained 3.75 cents a bushel to close at
$3.005. Analysts said the price rebound was a technical
reaction to several days of lower futures prices.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: While some commodities that surged in response to
the Middle Eastern crisis, such as oil and gold, fell back
yesterday from recent advances, copper continued advancing.
Futures again established new life-of-contract highs across
the board. Demand was active, and prices ended with a closing
rush. The September contract settled with a gain of 3.65
cents a pound at $1.3095. The contract traded to its high of
the day of $1.3140 in the final minute of the session.
According to one analyst, the late buying was mainly
technical. Some computer-guided funds had been selling
contracts short in anticipation of price declines. Instead,
they rose. When they advanced above key resistance levels,
further buying was touched off. The commodity funds bought
back, or covered, their previous short sales toward the
close, analysts said. There were no new developments, but
trading continued to be fueled by Japanese and West European
demand for copper, analysts said. Steady demand from European
merchants has been present every day recently, one analyst
said. There has been concern since Iraq invaded Kuwait a week
ago that inflation induced by high oil prices could reduce
demand for copper. Analysts said that in light of that
perception, yesterday's softer oil prices could have created
some price support for copper. According to Richard Hirsch, a
metals broker for Sharps Pixley Inc., New York metal brokers,
copper's price surge has been accompanied by strong advances
in all other base metals, despite high oil prices. Also, he
said, there was strong demand for copper futures contracts in
London that was associated with the options market there.
Traders who have sold call option contracts have protected
themselves from strong advances in the copper price by buying
copper futures contracts. A call option is a right to buy the
underlying futures contract at a specified price within a
certain period.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Most futures prices eased. The December
gold contract was off $1.50 an ounce at $392.20. September
silver declined 1.8 cents an ounce to $4.87. Platinum for
October delivery was unchanged at $482.10. Analysts said
gold's slight decline was actually a very good performance in
view of yesterday's plunge in crude oil prices and the
strength of the dollar. J. Clarence Morrison, analyst for
Prudential-Bache, observed that underpinning the market and
giving gold support were a number of factors, including a
higher level of investor demand, a perceived rise in
inflation caused largely by higher energy prices, and the
instability created by the Mideast crisis.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices eased. The October contract was down
0.11 cent a pound to 10.39 cents. The Mideast crisis has had
a depressing impact on the world sugar market, one analyst
said, because it has damped demand from many of the countries
in that area, which are normally significant and steady
buyers of sugar. However, underlying support has come from
dry weather that has plagued Western Europe over the past two
years and has more recently intensified, particularly in
France. The sugar beet crop is now in its growing stage and
lacks necessary moisture for the development of the beet
content, said Peter Leavitt, vice president of Weather
Services Corp. of Bedford, Mass. Some parts of sugar-beet
growing areas in northern France since July 1 have received
only about 25% of their normal moisture, and in areas close
to and in Benelux countries, rainfall is down about 50% from
normal, Mr. Leavitt said. He also noted that very high
temperatures, between 95 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, have
accompanied the dryness, further complicating the problem. A
cold front moved through northwestern Europe a few days ago,
Mr. Leavitt said, but it didn't bring any rain with it. The
weather in East and West Germany isn't as dry, he said. The
outlook for Western Europe is for little precipitation, Mr.
Leavitt said. Harvest of the European sugar beet crop will
begin in September.
