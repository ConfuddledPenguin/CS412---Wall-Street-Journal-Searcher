   IRAQ ANNEXED Kuwait and the first U.S. troops landed in
Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad declared that the emirate it overran a week ago
was "part of Iraq." As American troops, aircraft and ships
converged on the region, Bush said the U.S. military aim is
to defend the Saudis. He expressed hope Kuwait can be freed
through economic pressure on Iraq. As Arabs prepared to meet
today in Cairo to discuss joining a multinational army in
Saudi Arabia, Jordan's King Hussein said he would refuse to
recognize Baghdad's "annexation."

   The Iraqis moved surface-to-surface missiles into Kuwait
that can carry chemical warheads. Bush said the use of such
weapons "would be intolerable." One military flashpoint may
come today, when an Iraqi-owned tanker attempts to take on
Iraqi oil from a Saudi oil terminal in the Red Sea.
   The Bush administration said it is reaching out to Syria
and Iran, two U.S. adversaries, for help in pressuring Iraq.
And Baker said "extended discussions" have been held with
Yemen, which has appeared sympathetic to Baghdad.

black, in the U.S. each year.

charges.
