   NEW YORK -- It doesn't pay to be blunt on Wall Street
these days, especially if you work for a firm that is trying
to clean up its image.
   Just ask Mal Lowenthal, a stockbroker. He was fired by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., after making some crusty
remarks about the brokerage business to Dan Dorfman, a USA
Today columnist.

   In an interview published in the newspaper last Friday,
the 55-year-old Mr. Lowenthal called the securities business
"dirty." Twice, in response to two separate questions, both
regarding complaints about brokers, he said: "Our product is
money. And money attracts scum."
   Mr. Lowenthal also said in the interview that investors
should avoid a broker who "focuses solely on his firm's
research for ideas. This means he's a dummy who can't think
for himself."
   Though Mr. Lowenthal didn't mention Shearson by name, his
comments didn't sit well at the firm, which today becomes
virtually entirely owned by publicity-minded American Express
Co.
   In a statement, Shearson said: "Mr. Lowenthal's views on
the financial services industry, our firm and the people who
conduct our day-to-day business do not conform with the
firm's philosophy of quality service. Our employees are
dedicated and highly professional people. In light of our
fundamentally different views, we believed it to be in the
best interests of the firm to end the relationship."
   Shearson said later that the dismissal isn't an effort to
gag the firm's employees, who generally have free reign to
talk to news reporters. But the action underscores the
no-nonsense style of Shearson's new chairman, Howard L. Clark
Jr., a former American Express executive. Top Shearson
officials are on a campaign to bolster the firm's image. In
recent months, for example, Shearson has been roiled by a
management shake-up and a record quarterly loss.
   Reached yesterday at his Shearson office, where he was
packing his belongings into cartons, Mr. Lowenthal said he
wanted "to put the thing to bed." He said Shearson told him
he had painted the firm in a bad light. "But that wasn't my
intention," he said.
   Mr. Lowenthal said that Mr. Clark called him early Friday,
furious about the published remarks, and that senior
management told him the firm had gotten numerous phone calls
"looking for my head." Shearson insiders said these calls
came primarily from other Shearson brokers.
   Mr. Lowenthal, an 11-year Shearson veteran, said he
already has interviewed with several other securities firms,
and was hoping to hook up with one by next week. He said he
was heartened by a petition that circulated yesterday among
some Shearson brokers, asking the firm to rescind its
decision to dismiss him.
   The move is the second high-profile firing of a
brokerage-firm employee for speaking bluntly to news
reporters. In March, Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. fired a
securities analyst, Marvin Roffman, for making critical
remarks in The Wall Street Journal about the financial
prospects for the New York real estate developer Donald
Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
