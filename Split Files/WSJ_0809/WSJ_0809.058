   CHICAGO -- Dressed in his crisp banker's suit, Thomas C.
Theobald was in an elevator going up at Continental Bank
Corp. one day last week, headed for the top floor dining room
to meet a customer. Far above him, however, a mechanic was
liberally lubricating the elevator's cable, and Continental's
chairman and chief executive officer arrived for lunch all
splattered in oil.
   "Life," Mr. Theobald says, "is full of ugly surprises."

   Especially at Continental. While the banking industry has
been muddling along from one lending disaster to the next,
Continental has been muddling one step behind. After spending
a good part of the decade trying to recover from its 1984
collapse and federal rescue, under Mr. Theobald Continental
has raced to catch up with the competition -- only to find
that the competition now includes foreign banks and Wall
Street investment firms as well.
   Continental's lost time was evident last month when it
reported a second-quarter loss of $56.7 million. The loss was
largely due to a big charge taken to cover the cost of firing
900 employees -- quite a few of them high-priced talent hired
during the past two years. As it turned out, some businesses
Continental was dying to get into -- notably foreign exchange
and futures trading -- were businesses better gotten out of.
   The quick retreat, along with Continental's lackluster
earnings, once again stalls the turnaround of the biggest
individual banking failure in U.S. history. What's more, with
its size, payroll and influence in the industry all
diminished, it's less clear just what the government saved
with its $4.5 billion bailout. With the industry headed
toward consolidation, even some big banks that never suffered
Continental's woes are expected to disappear.
   Some people question Mr. Theobald's strategy of being a
pure commercial bank serving medium- and large-sized
companies. "I've always been somewhat skeptical of the
strategy," says William M. Isaac, a banking consultant who,
as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman, oversaw
Continental's bailout.
   Noting the fierce competition in commercial banking, Mr.
Isaac worries that Continental, which suffered an
international deposit run in 1984, is again totally reliant
on fickle purchased deposits. "I'd like to see them
reconsider the retail arena," where depositors rarely pull
out, Mr. Isaac says. "It's not too late."
   But Mr. Theobald isn't having any second thoughts. "I
wouldn't do a thing differently," he says. Noting that
Continental had scant consumer business to build on when he
arrived three years ago, he says the all-business strategy
was his only option.
   So, Continental has taken its best shot at selling a wide
array of new-fangled banking services like interest-rate
caps, and currency swaps. Big loans are still made, including
lots to leveraged buy-outs, but they're mostly resold to
other banks that can raise deposits to fund loans more
cheaply than Continental. In these areas, Continental has
made a lot of progress, but it still lags far behind
better-established competitors J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers
Trust New York Corp.
   Continental and other bank stocks have been pummeled in
recent weeks because of loan-quality fears. In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, its shares
closed at $11.375, up 37.5 cents. Late last year, however,
Continental shares traded as high as $26.625.
   The Continental Mr. Theobald inherited in 1987 was
essentially rudderless. The management team the FDIC had
hired -- retired oilman John E. Swearingen and retired banker
William S. Ogden -- bickered often during their three-year
tenure and didn't get much beyond stabilizing the place. When
their three-year hitch was up, Mr. Theobald was available,
having been edged out earlier for the top job at Citicorp. He
says he'd turned down job offers from other, less troubled
banks because he "wanted to take on one monumental
challenge."
   He set his all-business strategy, sold off Continental's
meager consumer operations, and launched an advertising
campaign that, like Mr. Theobald himself, spends as much time
ridiculing other banks for trying to be
all-things-to-all-people as it does pointing out that
Continental is just one thing.
   A Harvard MBA, Mr. Theobald split the commercial lending
department in two -- origination and distribution -- with one
team to make the loans and another to sell most of them off.
Walter J. Bloomenthal, a 19-year Continental veteran who
heads up loan distribution, says he sometimes ignores the new
reporting lines and takes his cue from "the origination
people -- because that's where the business is."
   Bringing Continental up to date also meant hiring a lot of
new faces, many at top dollar, including some up-front
signing bonuses and first-year-end bonuses guaranteed
regardless of performance, bankers say. S. Waite Rawls III
was lured from Chemical Bank in New York by the prospect of
being, at age 39, one of the youngest vice chairmen at any
major bank in the country, and placed in charge of all
trading and distribution. He made $625,000 last year, and
brought in scores of other trading officers to work under
him.
   The salaries were big enough that even as the number of
employees declined, Continental's expenses swelled.
Meanwhile, the lucrative leveraged buy-out lending business
sagged, and Continental found that it couldn't break into the
big leagues of foreign exchange trading. By the second
quarter of this year, when the big charge and other one-time
items are omitted, Continental was a bank only breaking even.
   The layoffs will trim the bank's overall payroll to about
6,500 and save $75 million a year. For those remaining,
making a profit will be easier, but job security less
certain.
   Continental recruited Michael P. Kamradt away from J.P.
Morgan in March 1989 to market so-called portfolio risk
management services. "They were pretty hot on a number of
areas," Mr. Kamradt recalls. But in little more than a year,
the bank began pulling back, and "I lost my belief in their
commitment." He left in June for another financial services
job.
   The staff cuts won't be enough to return Continental to
its profit goals. Revenue, which fell 19% in the second
quarter versus a year ago, will have to increase. Aside from
a Latin American interest payment now and then, which is
unpredictable at best, it isn't clear from where the added
revenue will come. Continental does have about $300 million
of real estate left to sell, which should bring hefty gains,
though Mr. Theobald won't say how rapidly he'll cash in.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Theobald is hoping to soon rid himself of a
couple of nasty distractions. One is the FDIC's remaining 26%
stake in Continental, which he calls a "continuing
embarrassment" to the bank. The Federal Reserve Board has
been reluctant to approve acquisitions or new banking powers
for Continental while it remains a partial ward of the
government.
   The FDIC Aug. 1 registered the shares with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in preparation for sale, but the
stock's recent plunge makes an offering seem unlikely for
now.
   The stock's plunge has also left Mr. Theobald's personal
options to buy 500,000 Continental shares at $21.50 each a
long way out of the money. His pay last year was $1.15
million.
   The other distraction is Continental's ownership of First
Options of Chicago Inc. The unit, which has lost more than
$250 million since Continental bought it in December 1986,
guarantees and processes options and futures trades. In the
1987 stock market crash, that turned out to be a disastrous
risk. And since then, revenue has plunged as trading volume
has fallen off.
   Mr. Theobald, who while at Citicorp oversaw a competing
bid for First Options, was slow to cut Continental's losses
in this case. Up for sale since last year, it is still
hemorrhaging, $9 million in the latest quarter. Spear, Leeds
&amp; Kellogg, the Wall Street firm that sold First Options to
Continental for $126.5 million, has been negotiating to buy
it back -- for a lot less.
