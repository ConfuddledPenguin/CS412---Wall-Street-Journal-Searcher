   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
lowered its ratings on securities of Potomac Electric Power
Co. and medium-term notes issued by the Potomac Capital
Investment Corp. unit.
   The rating concern said its actions affect a total of
about $2.2 billion in securities.

   Based on a review completed last Thursday, Moody's said it
concluded the utility has a weakened cash flow position and
higher capital spending levels, because of planned
construction of several peaking facilities from 1991 to 1993.
Also, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission
recently cleared a rate increase that was less than Potomac
Electric had requested.
   A Potomac Electric spokeswoman said, "We are disappointed
in the downgrade and we are addressing one of Moody's
concerns, namely the regulatory rate situation." She said the
utility hasn't decided whether to file for reconsideration,
appeal the decision or request another rate increase.
   Moody's lowered ratings on Potomac Electric's first
mortgage and secured pollution-control bonds to double-A-3
from double-A-2, debentures and medium-term notes to
single-A-1 from double-A-3, and preferred stock to double-A-3
from double-A-4. The unit's privately placed medium-term
notes were downgraded to single-A-1 from double-A-3.
   The prime-1 rating on commercial paper of both the utility
and unit weren't reviewed or changed.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Potomac Electric shares closed at $20.25, off 12.5 cents.
