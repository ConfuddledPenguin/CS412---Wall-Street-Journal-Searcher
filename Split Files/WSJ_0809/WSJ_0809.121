   PolyGram N.V., the recorded music company 80%-owned by
N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, is expected to report
Tuesday that its first-half net income fell 15% to 25%,
London investment analysts said.
   Several analysts predicted, however, that PolyGram would
still show a rise in net for the full year.

   The first half was disappointing partly because of
teething problems with two record labels PolyGram has
acquired in the past 13 months, Island International Ltd. and
A&amp;M Records Inc. Analysts said efforts to blend those labels
into PolyGram's distribution system held up some record
releases and produced exceptional costs.
   In addition, the acquisitions increased PolyGram's
interest costs. Analysts also noted that the year-earlier
half was exceptionally strong.
   James Golob, an analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities,
estimated that PolyGram's first half net tumbled 25% to 111
million Dutch guilders ($62 million) from 148 million
guilders ($83 million) a year earlier. But he predicted that
full-year net would rise 11% to 370 million guilders.
   Analysts at James Capel &amp; Co. forecast a drop of about 15%
for the half and a rise of 13% for the year.
   Despite the slow start, Warburg's Mr. Golob said that the
"strategic logic of the two acquisitions is still very much
intact." Long a powerhouse in Europe, PolyGram has said it
aims to use Island and A&amp;M to bolster its presence in the
U.S.
   Philips sold 20% of PolyGram late last year in a public
offering totaling about one billion guilders.
