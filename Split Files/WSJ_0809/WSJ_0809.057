   A man was murdered in my neighborhood in New York the
other day. He was a 33-year-old advertising man. The phones
in his apartment building were out of order, so, in late
evening, he stepped out to the corner phone to call a
colleague. A would-be robber came by and shot him dead.
   Murders in New York are hardly unusual -- last year, there
were 1,905, one every four and a half hours -- but the murder
in my generally quiet neighborhood was different. It wasn't a
domestic dispute. It wasn't a drug deal. It wasn't a gang
fight. Rather, it was a robbery in which the holdup man,
according to police, was a homeless person, one of several
who have taken over a little nearby park where mothers and
children used to gather.

   The Times ran his picture last week. I've seen him often.
   I read about the murder the same day I read yet another
story about yet another increase in the amount of money we're
going to have to pay to keep the savings-and-loan industry
afloat. Now, it's up around $500 billion, including interest.
I'm sure there will be higher estimates in coming months. But
what difference does it make? The figures became numbing
months ago.
   Yet I wondered: Would my neighbor be alive if just some of
that money had been earmarked to help the homeless? How much
money is the federal government spending on the poor,
deranged people who have no place to live?
   The answer, nationwide, is about $598 million. That's just
a little more than one-tenth of 1% of the amount we'll spend
on the savings-and-loan scandal. That puts in perspective, a
little, the enormity and enormousness of the scandal. Here is
the government spending half a trillion dollars to rectify
bad decisions -- sometimes just dumb, sometimes criminal --
made by executives and directors who, it turns out, were
accountable to no one.
   Why isn't anyone upset about this?
   Here are some other comparisons with that $500 billion
bailout:
   The entire cost of World War II, in current dollars and
including service-connected veterans' benefits, is about $460
billion. That's $40 billion less than the bailout.
   The cost of the Vietnam War, including benefits, stands at
$172 billion. Korea was $70 billion. World War I was $63
billion. The Civil War was $7 billion -- 1 1/2% of the cost
of the savings-and-loan debacle.
   The National Cancer Institute spent $1.3 billion on cancer
research last year. The National Institutes for Health spent
$582 million on heart disease, $171 million on lung disease,
$170 million on blood disease. Add them up: Less than
one-half of 1% of the S&amp;L money.
   Why isn't anyone upset?
   Across the country, corporations, foundations and
individuals give away about $100 billion a year. In other
words, if every charitable gift from every company, every
foundation, every living human and the will of everyone who
died this year were earmarked to bail out the
savings-and-loan industry, it wouldn't be enough to handle
the cost even without worrying about the interest on that
cost.
   If you add up the budget of every state, you get total
expenditures of about $450 billion, or at least you do if you
add up the fiscal 1987 figures, the latest I could find.
Again, less than the savings-and-loan bailout.
   You get the idea. It's hard to find anything in this
country -- or in history -- as costly as the savings-and-loan
scandal. No war, no defense program, no social program, no
other scandal has ever cost what this will cost.
   Why isn't anyone upset?
   All of the ads in all of the newspapers, on all of the
television stations and networks, on all of the billboards
and everywhere else cost the advertisers about $100 billion a
year. If you add up the assets of Prudential and Metropolitan
Life and Equitable Life and Aetna and Teachers Insurance and
New York Life and Connecticut General and Travelers and John
Hancock and Northwestern Mutual you still don't get to $500
billion. The 1988 profits of all the companies on the Fortune
500 list added up to just $115 billion.
   Why isn't anyone upset?
   Probably because the savings-and-loan horror isn't a crime
like the murder of the man in my neighborhood. There is no
one, identifiable victim, other than the taxpayer. There is
no one, identifiable perpetrator, other than the system.
   Yet, again, you wonder: If just a piece of that money
could be directed elsewhere, how many murders could be
prevented, how many homeless could be helped, how many
diseases could be conquered, how many police could be hired,
how many parks could be built?
   For it just isn't right. The advertising man in my
neighborhood is dead. The homeless man in my neighborhood is
in jail. But the people -- officers and directors, mainly --
who are costing us $500 billion, robbing us of money to cure
diseases or educate the poor or just pay off our debt, are
still free to enjoy the riches of life.
   Why?
