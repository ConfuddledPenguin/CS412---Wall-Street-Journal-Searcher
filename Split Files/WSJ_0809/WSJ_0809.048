   SANTA FE PACIFIC Corp. (Chicago) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it may upgrade its ratings on debt of this
railroad, natural resources and real estate concern, if Santa
Fe's financial flexibility improves. Ratings under review
include the company's senior subordinated payment-in-kind, or
PIK, debentures, rated single-B-2. The rating concern also is
reviewing several issues of Santa Fe's subsidiary, the
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway: equipment trust
certificates, rated single-A-3; mortgage bonds, Baa-3; and
adjustment mortgage bonds, Ba-1. Moody's said it views
favorably Santa Fe's refinancing of its PIK debentures, its
proposed spinoff of its real estate and energy units, and its
plan to speed up the restructuring of its railroad
operations. The refinancing, which includes an offer to
exchange equity for $200 million of the debentures, could
improve the company's leverage and debt coverage if
bondholders tender enough of their holdings, Moody's said,
and the railroad restructuring could enhance the company's
cash flow.
