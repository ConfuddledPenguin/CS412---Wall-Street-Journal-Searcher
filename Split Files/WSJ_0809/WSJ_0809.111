   Make no mistake. Saddam -- "He Who Confronts" -- is a
world problem. Not an Arab problem. Nor a problem simply for
the Japanese and the Europeans, who derive even more of their
oil from the Persian Gulf than does the U.S. Nor a short-term
problem the world can soon forget after oil markets
accommodate Saddam's actions with a modest increase in the
price of a barrel of oil to the $25 mark that he had been
pressing on OPEC. Nor is it a long-run problem that the U.S.
can dispose of simply by reducing U.S. dependence on imported
oil.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- if not reversed -- will be an
economic and political disaster of global proportions. It
will affect the First, Second and Third Worlds. Saddam
Hussein is a murderous neighborhood bully bent on expanding
indefinitely the neighborhood he terrorizes. Perceptions of
that fact, with varying degrees of clarity, have evoked the
extraordinary sanctions voted in the United Nations and the
belated but at last swift actions taken by the U.S., Europe,
the Soviet Union and even China, and by developing countries,
including key Arab states. The Soviet position is important
not only because it makes possible the U.N. consensus, but
because the changes in the Soviet Union free the U.S. and its
allies to use force if necessary in the Persian Gulf without
fear of opening vulnerabilities to Soviet attack.

   The oil shocks starting in 1973 marked the end of the
post-World War II "Golden Age" of unprecedented economic
growth in the industrial democracies. Between 1973 and 1986,
Japanese gross domestic product slowed to an annual growth
rate of about 4% from nearly 10%. Other industrial countries
slowed to about 2% from 4% or 6%; the growth-retarding effect
of the oil shocks accounted for much of this decline. The
cumulative loss in GDP due to the oil shocks exceeded $10
trillion in 1986 dollars. (A good deal of that damage
resulted from price controls and other government
interventions aimed at spreading the damage more equitably.)
Saddam Hussein can do much more harm. He can impose a
military discipline far more effective than any OPEC
consensus.
   Nor will the disasters be exclusively economic. Saddam has
shown that he won't hesitate to use force. If he thinks he
can get away with it, he'll move into Saudi Arabia to seize
direct ownership of this largest pool of low-cost oil
reserves. He plainly intended his cool lies about invading
Kuwait to support a "free Kuwait" independence movement to
display his contempt for world condemnation and so
calculatedly to inspire fear.
   He is neither grateful nor appeased by the plentiful
economic and military aid he has received from the neighbors
and industrial democracies he now threatens. Hitler sometimes
talked eloquently of peace and played on British guilt about
the harshness of Versailles. Saddam is never Mr. Nice Guy. He
exploits his reputation for unswerving brutality. As we face
him down, we should take care not to save face for him so
that, frustrated now, he can simply try again.
   The foreign ministries and intelligence agencies of Europe
and the U.S. long ignored the obvious about Saddam Hussein.
He has made clear the extent of his ambitions and the
ruthlessness with which he moves to achieve them for at least
15 years. He wants to control oil markets to realize
political aims that go far beyond economic power. He has, of
course, demanded that all foreign powers stay out of the Gulf
and the Indian Ocean. But his interests cover the
Mediterranean as well. Ten years ago, for example, his two
top ministers told a thrilled interviewer that his aims
included "the removal of American bases in Portugal, Spain,
Greece, Turkey and Cyprus."
   Anyone who dominated oil markets solely to maximize
long-term economic gain would pursue "moderate" price
policies. That's not Saddam. In the short run he would set
extortionate prices to recoup quickly the enormous costs of
his disastrously miscalculated attack on Iran. Once
established in control, he'd use sudden and massive changes
for large political ends.
   One major political end would be to quicken the increase
of his already formidable military power and extend its
reach. His million-man army and 5,500 tanks, etc., strike
fear in his neighbors. But to extend the range of his
intimidation he has already tested a ballistic missile of
800-to-1,000-kilometer range, and a space-launch vehicle with
a very large first stage. Such a vehicle makes feasible an
intermediate-range ballistic missile carrying a 500-kilogram
warhead that would menace Southern Europe -- as well as the
Middle East and much of the Soviet Union. With the wealth he
would accumulate if unchecked, it would not be hard for him
to buy the development of an even larger space launch vehicle
that could be adapted, with appropriate guidance, to carry
lethal warheads to intercontinental distances.
   What is more, increased oil revenues would help him
accelerate his development of warheads for mass destruction.
He has bought from the Western democracies the capacity to
make chemical weapons and is pushing the development of
nuclear weapons. The Israelis destroyed the nuclear research
reactor he bought from the French. But they did not touch the
facilities sold by the Italians that can separate
weapons-grade plutonium from spent reactor fuel -- which, as
a world-wide problem of waste disposal, is in plentiful
supply.
   In short, if we do not confront Saddam Hussein now, we
will find it much harder when he has extended the range of
his intimidation.
   The U.S. and its allies must face these facts squarely.
The widespread condemnation, including that of the Soviet
Union, is all to the good. The U.N. sanctions are even better
and have undoubtedly helped to induce swift international
action against Iraq. The U.S. has been moving the naval units
needed for an effective blockade of a kind contemplated in
Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. As soon as our forces are in
position we should put it into effect to enforce the U.N.
economic embargo and to prevent the embargo from slowly
dissipating. Both the British and the French have said they
would support a naval blockade and we are moving ships to
effect that support.
   But the more effective the embargo, the greater Iraq's
incentives to apply counterpressure by shutting off Saudi
production; and Saddam has shown he is a risk-taker. Iraq has
a formidable regional force, but if it moves on Saudi Arabia,
it has vulnerabilities that the U.S. can exploit -- with
appropriate access en route and in the theater and with the
help of our allies.
   Experts, who during the Iran-Iraq War repeated the foolish
stereotype that "Iraq can lose but only Iran can win" now
talk as if Iraq is invulnerable to forces that could be
brought into the area. It's not. Saddam's moves into Saudi
Arabia will almost surely face resistance by U.S. airborne
and mechanized divisions and air forces based in Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Diego Garcia and Turkey, with possible support
by British and Arab forces. Iraq's extended lines of supply
through featureless desert without cover would make its
forces ideal targets for precisely applied land-based air
power of sufficient range.
   Precise weapons, stealth and other advanced techniques for
penetrating defenses should also make possible highly
effective and discriminate air attacks against key military
targets -- including Iraq's air and missile forces, and
stocks and production facilities for chemical or nuclear
weapons. Ironically, precise air attacks against refineries
and stocks of refined products could leave Saddam awash in
crude oil while denying the fuel to support his military and
also avoiding widespread and long-lasting impairment of crude
production capacity. They could avoid indiscriminate
collateral damage to civilians in a war likely to be fought
before television cameras. Avoiding as much harm as possible
to Iraq's terrorized population is a political as well as
moral necessity.
   Turkey, it should have always been clear, has a key
military as well as economic role to play in Persian Gulf
contingencies. But NATO, in the past two decades,
increasingly took the view that the defense of the massive
interests of NATO members in the Persian Gulf was not a NATO
affair. Implicit was the threat that an attack on one of its
members that grew out of a Persian Gulf contingency would not
invoke the NATO guarantee.
   Turkey, therefore, reserving the use of its NATO bases for
NATO contingencies, has understandably refused any plans for
using its bases in the Persian Gulf. Turkey's shabby
treatment by the European Community and by a NATO preoccupied
with implausibly extreme contingencies on the inter-German
border has reduced Turkish ardor to be helpful. But Mr. Bush
and Mrs. Thatcher, said Monday that an attack on Turkey, a
member of NATO, would be an attack on all NATO. That is a
crucial step in making the Turkish bases recently occupied by
U.S. F-111s available to counter an Iraqi invasion in the
Gulf. If that is now NATO policy, it will reverse a long
history of deterioration starting with President Johnson's
statement in 1964 that the NATO guarantee might not apply
even in the case of a Soviet attack on Turkey that grew out
of the Cyprus crisis.
   In sum, if either the economic embargo or a blockade
enforcing it should lead Mr. Hussein to make his threatened
invasion of Saudi Arabia, he will get more than he bargained
for. Now is the time for closing the economic vise.
   Now is also better than later for confronting him in the
oil market. Consuming countries are in a strong position to
continue indefinitely the embargo on Iraq and Kuwait with the
cooperation of most of the other OPEC countries, especially
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Unused production capacity in
OPEC countries other than Iraq and Kuwait is enough to
restore OPEC production to its average level during 1989.
Once panic subsides, that should be more than enough to keep
crude oil prices at or below their levels before the invasion
of Kuwait. Moreover, oil stocks in the consuming countries
are high as a result of government stockpiling and the steady
growth in OPEC production over several years. These stocks
give insurance even against a temporary disruption of Saudi
production, if that should result from further aggression by
Iraq.
   The U.S. Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy, in
its report of January 1988, emphasized that the U.S.
government and NATO have neglected military dangers in the
Persian Gulf and in other places where they have massive
interests. The U.S. and NATO mistakenly took these critically
important contingencies as if they were "Lesser Included
Cases" of the two extreme attacks that have preoccupied us:
an unrestrained nuclear attack on the U.S., and a massive
conventional invasion through the Fulda Gap in West Germany.
These extreme contingencies were always far-fetched. In 1989,
half of this key commission conclusion became transparently
obvious as the countries in Eastern Europe moved to
independence and disintegration became evident within the
Soviet Union itself. We may be lucky that Saddam Hussein has
made the other half equally clear sooner rather than later.
   With the increasing spread of weapons of mass destruction
and high technology for delivering them, new strategy, forces
and technologies need elaboration; the plausible important
contingencies are not "lesser included cases" of the
extremes. These cases call for smaller but different forces,
rather than the proportionate reductions that members of
Congress, eager to reduce budgets and at the same time
protect weapons production and bases in their districts, are
likely to provide. This is particularly so since the air
space and bases to which the U.S. needs access in order to
protect its critical interests overseas are not in any
congressman's district.
   The ability of the U.S. to project suitably discriminate
power in a timely way in the Persian Gulf or other threatened
areas has eroded as it has lost such access. It will erode
further unless the administration and Congress recognize the
massive changes that have taken place -- and the great
dangers that will persist and grow. According to the New York
Times, just before the crisis in Kuwait, Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney had been moving toward a strategy that sounds
very much like what's required. The present crisis should
give a powerful impulse not merely to prevent excessive cuts
but, even more essential, toward reshaping U.S. forces to
meet the real dangers.
   The present crisis will test Europe's willingness to join
in the defense of its most important interests. It will test,
also, the future of NATO and its ability to develop strategy,
force structure and technology appropriate to the massive
changes under way in the world.
   A U.S. military presence in Europe will continue to have a
role in protecting U.S. interests in that vital region.
Europeans still want that presence. But it can't be justified
by the contingency of a massive Warsaw Pact invasion through
the center of Europe. More plausible contingencies, like the
present one in the Persian Gulf, call for a forward force
flexible enough to react quickly and for the bases to provide
a sustained defense against aggressions that affects our
interest.
   Saddam Hussein, who needs to be thrown out of Iraq as well
as from Kuwait, illustrates what should have been obvious all
along: that even as communist empires break up and many of
their parts move toward democracy and free markets, the world
will continue to present military dangers to critical
interests of the U.S. and its allies. We need a strategy and
forces shaped to meet these very real dangers.
