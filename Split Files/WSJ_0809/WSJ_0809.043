   THE SAVINGS RATE may shrink further as oil crisis forces
spending changes.
   "Disruption means less income, and less income means less
saving," says Franco Modigliani, the Nobel-laureate economist
at MIT. Savings are crucial to help finance a "dis-saving"
government, and to provide business capital. An oil-price
rise of 6% or 7% won't have much effect, Mr. Modigliani says,
noting: "I would begin to worry at 30%." Harvard economist
Lawrence Summers says even the price hikes so far mean
"you're likely to see some reduction in the savings rate over
the next several quarters." But he adds that "in the long run
it's not likely to have a big effect." Personal savings have
been meager for a while.

   WEFA Group's Larry Kimbell recalls that in the two earlier
oil shocks, about 50% of marginal gains in disposable income
went for energy needs. MIT's Mr. Modigliani says saving is
off world-wide, due to big government deficits and slowing
global economies. He notes some demographics also hurt: Women
swell the work force but add less to savings than to overall
income because of expenses for child care, home help and
prepared food. The oil crisis tops off a tankful of economic
woes, but Jesup Josephthal's David Bostian sees a possible
benefit: "motivation to save more, if the cash drain isn't
overwhelming."
   The 1989 savings rate recently was revised downward by
nearly one percentage point to 4.6%.
                                                                                                       

   SICK OF THE '60s? Too bad. Retailers hope retro rags will
dress up fall profits.
   After heavy discounting in women's apparel last year,
stores aim for firmer margins with reborn miniskirts,
stretch-pants, bodysuits (a.k.a. catsuits), psychedelic
leggings, "tent" dresses and little A-line Jackie ensembles.
In the first half, women's and children's clothing sales
inched up 0.7% to $96.8 billion in real dollars, pressuring
profits, says Edward Johnson, of Johnson Redbook Service. He
adds, "Fashion doesn't make as much difference as the price."
   Kal Ruttenstein, head of fashion direction at
Bloomingdale's, stresses updates, like the new Puccis. Groovy
in the '60s, the Sequel Decade's version has subtle changes
-- a modern shoulder, different darts. Joan Kaner, New York
fashion director at Neiman-Marcus, says of the '60s: "The
clothes were very futuristic. I think we gave it up all too
quickly." Will "go-go" go over again with over-40 women who
now have kids, careers and cellulite? "They might be in
better shape now than in their 20s," says Ms. Kaner. If not,
she notes there are options such as the short but full,
leg-flattering tent dress. She adds: "What's under the tent
is your secret."
                                                                                                       

   ROAD WORRIERS flood auto clubs with gas complaints. But
few cancel vacations.
   The American Automobile Association says members irate
over prices keep phone lines busy. But it says part of the
reason summer trips aren't being canceled is that gas still
accounts for only a small portion of expenses. It figures a
family of four spends about $172 a day for lodging and about
$30 on gas -- up from $20 before the recent increases.
Another reason: Summer is two-thirds over and so are most
vacations.
   Last summer, motorists drove their vehicles on 264 million
trips of 100 miles or more. Meanwhile, membership in major
auto clubs rises. Shell Motor Club says its ranks swell 15% a
year. Requests for help also rise. Amoco Motor Club says
calls for road service rose 3.5% last year while 5.5% more
motorists sought help mapping trips.
   Timely samaritans: 350 California Unocal stations offer
free freeway aid. Vans cruise with cellular phones, gas.
                                                                                                       

   PARTNER WANTED: Nearly 20% of 250 midsize firms polled for
Grant Thornton say their growth strategy calls for a joint
venture. Some 81% say they'd seek a foreign partner; 72%
specify Japanese.
                                                                                                       

   CHARGE IT TO EGOTISM: Citibank tests a credit card with
the owner's photo. The bank hopes the card will thwart theft
and appeal to consumer vanity.
                                                                                                       

   ADOPT-A-BEACH, a cleanup program of the Texas General Land
Office, seeks a hand from plastics firms. Exxon Chemical pays
to convert 5,000 pounds of Texas trash into 12 plastic,
barnacle-proof benches.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTHY BANKS HARRUMPH at being tarred with the troubled
S&amp;L brush.
   An advance promo for a recent ABC-TV "Nightline" episode
about failing banks and thrifts pictured Key Bank of Western
New York in Buffalo. That evening, host Ted Koppel apologized
for "scaring the daylights out of depositors." The gaffe
footage related to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s
earlier closing of Permanent Bank for Savings and its
subsequent purchase by KeyCorp. Healthy KeyCorp units were
deluged with calls and some withdrawals.
   During the program, Stanford economist Dan Brumbaugh got
things roiling again by calling most of the nation's 10
largest banks "near true insolvency." Several incensed big
banks said that a few customers, citing the remarks, withdrew
all their funds the next morning. McKinsey &amp; Co.'s Lowell
Bryan calls the economist's comments "unhelpful" and
"inaccurate." Oh, yeah? Mr. Brumbaugh replies the comments
are "helpful" and "accurate."
   Overall, banks benefit from S&amp;L woes. In 1989, small
deposits rose 17% at banks despite moderating rates.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Dead Stop, a chemical patch that detects carbon
monoxide in cars, buses and basements, comes from CO Alert
Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Fla. . . . A College of Wooster
student thesis carries this note of thanks: "to Rene for
proffreading."
