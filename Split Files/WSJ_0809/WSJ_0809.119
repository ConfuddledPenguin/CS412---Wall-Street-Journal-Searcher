   Computer Factory Inc. reported a net loss of $7.3 million,
or 85 cents a share, for its third quarter ended June 30 and
said it plans to consolidate some retail operations.
   The Elmsford, N.Y., computer dealer has suffered more than
most from the withering price war on personal computers over
the past year and a half. Computer Factory's stock has lost
more than 85% of its value over the past two years, closing
yesterday at $2.25, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.

   Computer Factory said part of its loss could be attributed
to a $2.6 million charge related to the consolidation, but it
also had a loss of $4.7 million from operations. That
compares with net income of $82,000, or one cent a share, in
the year-earlier period. Sales climbed 2.3% to $83.9 million
from $82 million.
   The company said it will try to return to profitability by
closing some of its smaller, marginal branches and
consolidating them into so-called superstores, which will
offer a broader array of products. Computer Factory said it
plans to open four of the large stores over the next nine
months.
   In the nine-month period, the company had a net loss of
$10.4 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with year-earlier
profit of $6.5 million, or 73 cents a share. Sales rose 6.7%
to $297.7 million from $279.1 million.
