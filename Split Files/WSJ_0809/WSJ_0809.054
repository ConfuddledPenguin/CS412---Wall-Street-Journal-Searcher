   WASHINGTON -- Early this week Celinda Lake, a Democratic
political consultant, got on the telephone with a half-dozen
of her clients seeking office across the country and gave
them some simple advice: If your opponents have taken money
from the oil companies, call a news conference right now and
denounce them.
   Oil-company bashing, one of the staples of politics of the
mid-1970s, is back in style.

   Even the staunchly pro-industry Bush administration
provided some jabs for the oil companies. The president
yesterday urged the oil companies "to do their fair share"
and "show restraint." Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
warned: "Those who are doing the gouging will hear from the
president."
   Though the crisis in the Persian Gulf isn't a week old,
the dramatic increases in gasoline prices already have
emerged as a potent political issue. Josie Heath, a
Democratic senatorial contender in Colorado, has placed her
attacks on major oil companies at the center of her campaign.
Democratic Rep. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, where driving
distances make gasoline prices a critical economic factor, is
visiting the small towns of his state and complaining that
"there's some evidence of price-gouging and profiteering
going on by the major oil companies."
   Many of the lawmakers competing for House and Senate seats
this fall cut their political teeth on the ankles of oil
company executives in the 1970s, and this tactic fits
comfortably into their campaign repertoire. It also affords
Democratic candidates an opportunity to make political points
at a time when the public is rallying around a Republican
president.
   "It's a made-to-order issue for politicians whose
stock-in-trade is economic populism," says James Reichley, a
political scientist at the Brookings Institution. "But it's
also a way for conservatives to show that they're not
controlled by economic interests."
   Indeed, some Republicans are preparing arguments much like
those of their Democratic colleagues. "We sometimes need a
big corporate-culture person to attack so we can show we're
not one of them," says Linda DiVall, a Republican political
consultant. "The oil companies seem to qualify."
   That calculation -- along with an effort to keep prices
down with the time-honored Washington tool of jawboning --
was behind the president's remarks yesterday. Mr. Bush said
he hoped the "rapid spike in oil prices will not be
permanent" and that "things will return much more to normal
in the market."
   Other administration officials are picking up the
offensive. "The administration sees the need now for some
low-level populism," says Kevin Phillips, a Republican
political theorist who has called for the GOP to take a more
populist approach. "Yes, the president's remarks are implicit
jawboning of the companies, but the president is also
signaling to the companies that if they do gouge, politics is
going to push him toward taking some action against them," he
said.
   Some Republicans, such as Rep. William Dannemeyer of
California, have taken a different tack, arguing that the
crisis underscores the nation's vulnerability to Middle East
instability and that the U.S. must be more aggressive about
pursuing other sources of energy -- including oil buried off
the California shore and in the Arctic, as well as nuclear
energy.
   The rhetoric already has reached white-hot temperatures.
Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut charges that
"the oil industry of this country is plundering us just as
Saddam Hussein is plundering Kuwait." Democratic Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts says that the early price increases
raise "questions about even patriotism and the better
interests of the economy of this country." And Democratic
Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada says that "apparently the laws
of economics only work one way, against the interest of the
consumer."
   Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) is trying to
drum up support for a broad federal antitrust investigation
of the oil companies. "It doesn't seem that what goes up must
come down," he says. Mr. Schumer adds that the companies may
not be colluding, but suggests that the situation consists of
"large companies winking at each other" on pricing. He says
he wants the government to go further than the Justice
Department's current plan of tracking down individual
allegations of price collusion and to undertake a "complete
antitrust investigation." And Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison,
a Connecticut gubernatorial candidate, vowed to introduce a
bill in Congress to restore the windfall-profits tax.
   Oil company excutives, who were summoned to a series of
hearings on Capitol Hill earlier this week, gave a number of
explanations for the price spike: that oil is paid for at the
time of delivery, regardless of price at the time of the
contract; that oil companies have in fact showed restraint
because they have yet to pass on to consumers the full costs
of rising crude-oil prices; and that they are as much victims
of the market as manipulators, since they purchase gasoline
on the fluctuating spot market as well.
   But some oil companies moved to respond to President
Bush's request, at least temporarily. Atlantic Richfield Co.
yesterday said it would freeze wholesale fuel prices for one
week, although the company said in a statement it will have
to reassess its position if the market doesn't stabilize in a
week's time.
   Some political consultants are cautioning their clients of
the dangers of attacks on the oil companies. "There's
extraordinarily strong hostility toward the prices
immediately going up," says Paul Maslin, a Democratic
pollster. "But candidates have to be very cautious. People
are also worrying about the safety of U.S. soldiers."
   Even so, anger has moved swiftly from the pump to the
politicians. For the past several days, gas station operators
have been complaining to the Service Station Dealers of
America, their Washington trade group, of concern, even
abuse, from customers. "People are really mad at the major
oil companies, and we want to keep them mad at them," says
Joseph Coach, executive director of the group. "We're telling
people to call their congressmen. Congress is ready to go on
the attack."
   Even before the Persian Gulf crisis and the ensuing run-up
in gasoline prices, oil companies weren't very popular with
U.S. consumers. In The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of
Buying" poll last year, for instance, only 6% of those
surveyed said they had a great deal of trust and confidence
in the oil industry -- while 22% named it as one of the
industries they had the least amount of confidence in.
   The oil companies, already battered by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill, seem peculiarly vulnerable to populist political
attacks, much like the railroads of the late 19th century.
"They have become the Darth Vader of corporations," says Ms.
Lake, the Democratic political consultant. "It's open season
on them for politicians."
   The companies already are on the defensive, with some of
them being told by their high-priced lobbyists and publicists
that they miscalculated in permitting pump prices to escalate
so swiftly and so dramatically.
   "The money they are going to spend digging themselves out
of the hole will far exceed however much they made in the
first 48 hours," says one lobbyist for a major oil company.
"It's clear: You don't pass on a price increase during a
major crisis."
