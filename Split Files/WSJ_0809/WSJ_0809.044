   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Chairman Edward A. Brennan
reassumed the reins at the company's giant merchandising
operation in what amounts to an admission that the company's
retailing approach isn't working.
   The 56-year-old Mr. Brennan ousted his merchandising
chief, Michael Bozic. The move reflects the company's growing
frustration over its failure to turn around its $31
billion-a-year retailing business. Mr. Brennan, who ran the
Sears retail business in the early 1980s, insisted in a
statement that he still has "confidence" in the strategy of
adding national brands to its stable of house labels.

   But he said, "We need to move faster and step up its
implementation." He added: "We will focus our efforts on
reducing costs and improving profitability" while
"aggressively" revamping stores to emphasize national brands
in key product categories.
   The 49-year-old Mr. Bozic, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Sears merchandise group since 1986, was given
the new title of president and chief operating officer of the
group. But the executive was stripped of responsibility for
Sears's core retail business -- its 850 U.S. stores -- and
lost his seat on the corporate board of directors.
   The change in command comes just days after the disclosure
that Sears and its crosstown rival, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
had discussed a merger. Montgomery Ward is run by Mr.
Brennan's younger brother Bernard, who has cut costs sharply
and revived profits at that company. He is understood to have
proposed that he lead Sears along a similar path. A Sears
spokesman denied that there was any connection between the
talks and the management shakeup. But the talks, though
terminated, certainly pointed out weaknesses to Sears
executives.
   Sears is also in a prolonged earnings slump, including an
especially disappointing first half. Net income fell 47%,
partly because expenses grew more rapidly than retail sales.
And Sears's stock price, which has hovered below book value,
lately has been setting new 52-week lows. Yesterday, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock
closed at $29.625, down 37.5 cents.
   Mr. Brennan, who led the merchandise group to its peak
earnings year in 1984, will continue to oversee the company's
Allstate insurance, Dean Witter brokerage and Coldwell Banker
real estate operations as corporate chairman and chief
executive.
   But Mr. Brennan, who has been criticized by investors for
focusing on the company's financial service operations and
giving short shrift to retailing, clearly intends to get more
involved in the core business. One sign is that he plans to
move key merchandising executives to corporate offices on the
68th floor of the Sears Tower so he can work more closely
with them. They include Laurence E. Cudmore, the 54-year-old
former Canadian retail chief who joined the Sears merchandise
group staff as president of stores last year in a surprise
move. Under the new management structure, he reports directly
to Mr. Brennan, bypassing Mr. Bozic.
   Messrs. Brennan, Bozic and Cudmore were unavailable for
comment. But Mr. Cudmore said in an interview earlier this
year that he believed he was tapped for a top job because, as
a newcomer to corporate headquarters, he could be "objective"
and wouldn't base decisions on "a personal agenda." He said
he viewed "improving our financial performance" as his
biggest challenge.
   In a memo to Sears employees yesterday, Mr. Brennan hinted
that more changes are in the works. He said his decision
followed "an intensive study of all aspects of our
operations." One outside director was more blunt. Asked if
Sears will cut more costs, he said: "I would certainly hope
so."
   Analysts said Mr. Brennan might make further cuts in
Sears's huge headquarters staff, close outdated stores or
even trim the company's advertising budget to produce
short-term earnings.
   But some people in the industry questioned how much Mr.
Brennan, a third-generation Searsman who can rhapsodize for
10 minutes about the merits of a house-brand Kenmore washer,
is willing to change. They pointed out that he approved Mr.
Bozic's decisions. "Ed is so steeped in history and
tradition," said one person familiar with the situation. "He
bleeds Sears blood."
   Nevertheless, at Sears, Mr. Brennan is viewed as a more
charismatic leader than Mr. Bozic, whose strength is plotting
strategy.
