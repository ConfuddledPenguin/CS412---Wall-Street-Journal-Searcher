   Burbank, Calif. -- God -- and Bill Larzelere -- are in the
details.
   Since 1975, Mr. Larzelere has run an automotive shop
catering to people who want their vehicles to shine like a
cheap suit, and antique-car collectors who enter auto shows
where a dust mote in the air-conditioning vent can spell the
difference between first and second place. In a town where
you are what you drive, and where car washes and so-called
car detailers proliferate, Mr. Larzelere is viewed by devoted
customers as every bit the equal of the Almighty.

   Often, even new cars fresh out of the dealership are taken
to Mr. Larzelere's Burbank Boulevard shop for some spit and
polish before their highly discriminating owners drive them
home.
   "There's such a quantity of cars that goes through a
dealership and the cars aren't really finished or prepared or
cleaned after shipping," says Mr. Larzelere, a burly,
reassuring 46-year-old. "In a lot of instances we get paint
that's scratched or full of buffer swirls."
   New car, old car, Datsun or Duesenberg, it's all the same
to Mr. Larzelere, who can take cleanliness "as far as the
customer wants."
   Some customers -- Mr. Larzelere calls them clean freaks --
want to take it pretty far. Take, for example, the woman who
brought in her new Mercedes pointing out traces of grease
around the boltheads that fasten the seat to the floor, or
take the man distressed about the barely discernible dirt
around the levers of the steering column. "We make notes on
some of these people to know what they're looking for. The
Sagittarians are the worst," says Mr. Larzelere, a mustached
Pisces, who drives a well-rusted -- but reasonably clean --
1962 Dodge.
   When Mr. Larzelere is readying a car for a prestigious
show like Pebble Beach's Concours d'Elegance, no detail is
too minute. The screwheads that hold together various parts
of the car are lined up so that the grooves all point the
same way. The carpet nap is brushed so that it all stands in
the same direction, the trunk toolbox is tidied and the tires
-- including the spare -- are pumped up to equal pressure.
   Mr. Larzelere traces his passion for clean machines to a
childhood spent watching his father restore race cars, and
hanging out with the hot-rod-crazed older guys in the
neighborhood. "I used to take care of their cars, and in
exchange they'd let me use them for dates," he says. "When I
started building my own cars I always made sure they were
clean because I didn't want to get dirty working on them."
   The tools of Mr. Larzelere's trade include Pledge (dandy
for dusting and cleaning car interiors and for chassis and
engine compartments). He uses a cotton similar to the fiber
used in sanitary napkins for applying polish and removing
wax, Q-tips or skewer strips to clean cracks and crevices,
plain soap and water to clean the underside of the car and
fine-grade sandpaper to grind out imperfections in exterior
paint surfaces. Waxing and polishing, a complicated
eight-step process, are done under the unforgiving scrutiny
of a portable fluorescent lamp.
   "Bill has a relationship with paint that very few people
have," says longtime customer Bruce Meyer, owner of Geary's,
a purveyor of crystal and china in Beverly Hills. "After your
car is painted you need someone who knows how to sand it and
polish it. Bill knows how to make dry paint look wet."
   It is work that requires the forbearance of Job and the
serenity of Mr. Rogers. "I've learned to become really
tolerant," says Mr. Larzelere. A lucky thing considering he
counts among his customers a man who, while renovating his
home went through six different toilets because he didn't
like the sound of the flush. "He's the kind of guy," says Mr.
Larzelere, "who would pick up his car from me Friday and
bring it back Saturday if he used it Friday night." Another
longtime customer visits his car while it's being detailed,
going so far as to photograph the progress. Some of the cars
Mr. Larzelere so carefully details never get driven; they'd
only get dirty again goes the thinking.
   A former clean freak himself, Mr. Larzelere once
plastic-wrapped the underside of his car in a futile attempt
to protect it from the rain. "My biggest pet peeve," he says,
"are people who have a nice car and don't take care of it
correctly or neglect it by leaving it outside in all
seasons."
   Or leaving ketchup-coated french fries under the seats.
"We have taken some interesting stuff out of cars," says Mr.
Larzelere. "We did a car that belonged to somebody who took
out a celebrity. The celebrity had too much to drink and got
sick in the car." Naturally, Mr. Larzelere was called the
next day to police the area, "which I felt was out of my
jurisdiction," he says. "I thought the person responsible for
the mess should clean up after himself but. . . ."
   The concrete block and wood wall that wraps around Mr.
Larzelere's shop bears no sign; nothing reveals the nature of
the business conducted inside the enclosure, and the shop's
number is unlisted. Referrals have given Mr. Larzelere more
work than he can handle. "If someone wants to find him badly
enough they find him," says Mr. Larzelere's wife, Barbara.
Indeed, one man who read a newspaper article revealing that
the shop was on Burbank Boulevard spent weeks driving up and
down the strip, stopping at different places until he found
someone who could locate Mr. Larzelere.
   During my visit, one of the shop's two hoists held a
disassembled 1969 Maserati Ghibli Spyder whose engine,
chassis and inside were being fully restored. On the other
was a movie producer's 1988 Lamborghini Countach, in for a
cleaning. Mr. Larzelere prefers to work on only three or four
cars at a time -- one customer has been waiting a year for an
appointment -- but he has to allow for emergencies like,
well, water spots.
   "I've had customers call me at midnight, one o'clock in
the morning," says Mr. Larzelere. "They were driving out of
Chasen's and the restaurant turned on the sprinklers and they
have water spots on their cars. I had another guy call me
who'd been driving somewhere and somebody threw something on
the car and he had to get it off immediately or his world
would end, I suppose."
   "They act like Bill is a doctor, that he's on call 24
hours a day," says Mrs. Larzelere. "I've had to be rude."
   It must be the doctor-sized bills that confuse the people.
A basic detailing -- interior, exterior, wheels and tires,
doorjamb, trunk jamb -- takes about a day and a half and runs
$350 (the average price elsewhere is about $100). More
elaborate jobs like car restorations can run into the months
and thousands.
   "Bill charges more than average but I can't deny the
quality of his work," says Lillian Bin, the manager of a
Beverly Hills law office, who has her Mercedes detailed every
three months. "If there's a bit of nail polish on the head
liner he won't miss it. If there's dirt buildup on the
armrest or water spots on the doorjamb he always finds them."
   Some people are a bit bewildered by it all. Several years
ago, a man brought in his wife's Ferrari convertible for
extensive detailing. A month went by, then another and
another. The wife was getting suspicious. "She said it didn't
take three months for a car to be washed," says Mrs.
Larzelere. "She thought Bill must have destroyed it."
   "This car wasn't cleaned," insisted the woman when she and
her Ferrari were finally reunited. "It had a hysterectomy."
