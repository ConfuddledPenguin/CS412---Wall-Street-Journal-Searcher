   One of the little curses
   Of writing newspaper verses
   Is that these very pages
   Could line tomorrow's bird cages.
   However, there is a chance,
   In just the right circumstance,
   That they may be read once more
   On a refrigerator door.
   -- Pat D'Amico.

   Money Markets
                                                                                                       

   When my father used to give me my allowance, he jokingly
would say, "Now, don't spend it all in one place." Of course,
that was before we had malls.
