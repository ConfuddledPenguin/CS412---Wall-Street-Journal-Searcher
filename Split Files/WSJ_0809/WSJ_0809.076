   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy was slowing markedly even
before oil prices shot up, according to a new Federal Reserve
survey.
   "Business and banking contacts . . . generally report
continued economic growth, though most noted that the pace
was slow or had slackened recently," the Fed report said.

   The increasing weakness was particularly evident in
residential and commercial construction, but in many parts of
the country the Fed also found manufacturing to be "flat,"
retail sales to be "soft to a little higher than a year ago"
and growth in bank loans to be "slow."
   The new Fed report, prepared in July by the 12 district
Federal Reserve banks, adds to the accumulating evidence that
the U.S. economy is edging closer to recession, if it isn't
already in one. It follows last week's employment report that
suggested a significant weakening in the economy in July. The
Fed has said that it is trying to avoid a recession, and the
new signs of a deteriorating economy put pressure on it to
lower interest rates, even as the spurt in oil prices adds to
the inflation rate.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, speaking to the
National Press Club yesterday, suggested that it's time for
the Fed to lower rates. "We think that although inflation is
important, that the maintenance of economic growth, and even
the pushing of economic growth, is very, very important," he
said.
   The chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
Richard Rahn, said yesterday that the group is forecasting a
recession for the first time since 1981, and he blamed the
Fed.
   "The impending recession is not the result of Iraqi
adventurism in the Middle East," said Mr. Rahn, a frequent
critic of the Fed. "It is due to bad economic policy by the
U.S. government. The Federal Reserve has left the economy no
margin of error, and by fulfilling Murphy's law, the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait only makes a bad situation worse." Mr.
Rahn predicted the economy will grind to a halt in the
current quarter and enter a recession in the fourth.
   The domestic economy, while paramount, isn't the Fed's
only concern. Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, said that it will be "very
difficult" for the Fed to lower short-term U.S. interest
rates while interest rates overseas and long-term interest
rates in the U.S. are rising.
   The Fed survey found economic conditions particularly weak
up and down the Eastern Seaboard and in some parts of the
Midwest. Other regions continue to grow, albeit slowly. The
word "recession" was mentioned only once, and that came in a
quote from a building-supply company in the Minneapolis area.
   Construction activity is down from last year's levels in
nearly all regions. Unsold houses are discouraging new
construction and putting downward pressure on prices in many
areas, the Fed said. In areas where the Fed asked about
commercial construction, most respondents saw "weak or
slackening activity." There are still hot spots, though. The
San Francisco Fed said housing markets in Las Vegas and
Sacramento are still "vigorous."
   Weakness in the manufacturing sector is also widespread,
the Fed found. Philadelphia-area manufacturers reporting
declining activity in July outnumbered those posting gains by
nearly 2-1. Defense industries are laying off workers in
several regions. Textile and furniture sales are down.
   One bright spot is the U.S. steel industry. Because Europe
is using more of its own steel, it is exporting less to the
U.S., and U.S. producers report stronger orders as a result.
Aside from steel, business for U.S. exporters is also up.
   The Fed survey found that the pace of commercial loan
growth has slowed recently, both because a slow economy has
reduced borrowers' demand for loans and because of the credit
crunch that prompted the Fed to ease its grip on credit
slightly last month. Some Chicago banks said business loans
are expanding less than they expected. Philadelphia bankers
expect only "minor gains" in business lending.
   The Fed report was prepared for the next formal meeting of
the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee, scheduled for
Aug. 21. At times of economic uncertainty, the committee
often confers by telephone.
   Here's a synopsis of the Fed's survey, region-by-region:
                                                                                                       

   Boston
                                                                                                       

   Second-quarter growth at companies in this district was
slow and slowing. Retail sales were flat to down from a year
earlier, with clothing and home items down. Availability of
bank credit remains a problem for half the respondents.
Exports outperformed domestic sales, boosting total sales
above mid-1989 levels at more than half of the firms
surveyed. (The Boston Fed covers Massachusetts, Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and most of Connecticut.)
                                                                                                       

   New York
                                                                                                       

   Developments are mixed, with unemployment below the
national level but consumer spending soft, vacancy rates
slightly higher in Manhattan and homebuilding slower
throughout the area. Continuing contraction in downtown
Manhattan financial firms was responsible for higher vacancy
rates, but declining rents and other concessions may boost
rentals. Unemployment declined in western New York, but
coming plant closings in Buffalo, N.Y., and Hoboken, N.J.,
cloud the outlook. Demand for both residential and commercial
real estate loans is weaker than a year earlier.(New York,
northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Conn.)
                                                                                                       

   Philadelphia
                                                                                                       

   Economic conditions appear stagnant, with little or no
growth seen for the remainder of the year. Just over half the
manufacturers surveyed reported steady business. Retailers
see a slow summer with a possible pickup in sales in the
fall. Bankers described slow lending, with virtually no new
commitments in commercial lending. (Eastern Pennsylvania,
Delaware and southern New Jersey.)
                                                                                                       

   Cleveland
                                                                                                       

   Consumer spending rebounded moderately in June and
continued into July. Manufacturing output has been better
than expected, with the strong demand for steel abroad and
weak domestic prices helping sales. Inflationary pressures
remain, with purchasing agents expecting 4% to 5% inflation
by the end of the year. Higher crude oil prices will add to
those pressures. Funds remain available for single-family
home construction, with lending tighter for multifamily
units. (Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky and
northern West Virginia.)
                                                                                                       

   Richmond
                                                                                                       

   Business conditions weakened, with tourism and retail
sales down. Manufacturing activity softened, with furniture
sales down. Respondents said that textiles sales are also
down, with several textile plants closed. Prices were up for
both materials and merchandise. Exports were mixed at area
ports. Loan requests were steady, but 40% of financial
institutions report lower-quality applications. (Virginia,
Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, the District of
Columbia and most of West Virginia.)
                                                                                                       

   Atlanta
                                                                                                       

   The region is growing slowly. Big-ticket items are selling
well below last year's levels, with respondents reporting
that weakness continues in commercial and residential
construction. Manufacturing is mixed, with textiles,
automobiles and furniture weak but paper, aluminum and farm
equipment sales increasing. Droughts have resulted in heavy
losses in the region, particularly Georgia and Tennessee.
Export demands from the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and
Japan have helped poultry sales. (Georgia, Alabama, Florida,
eastern Tennessee, southern Mississippi and southern
Louisiana.)
                                                                                                       

   Chicago
                                                                                                       

   Manufacturing contributed slow but consistent growth, led
by increases in orders for truck engines and electronic
parts. Steel shipments in the third quarter are expected to
be ahead of seasonal gains. Commercial and industrial lending
was at or below expectations, with construction lending hurt
by restrictions on savings and loan associations. Crop prices
have been volatile, largely due to speculation over crop
yields. (Northern Illinois, Iowa, lower peninsula of
Michigan, most of Indiana, southern Wisconsin.)
                                                                                                       

   St. Louis
                                                                                                       

   Economic growth continues to be sluggish. Manufacturing
activity has weakened recently, and many defense contractors
are cutting back production. High vacancy rates and flat
rents have halted apartment building except in Louisville.
Lending has slowed, and crops are reported in fair to good
condition. (Eastern Missouri, Arkansas, western Kentucky,
western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, southern Illinois
and southern Indiana.)
                                                                                                       

   Minneapolis
                                                                                                       

   The economy appears reasonably healthy, with
resource-related industries showing no signs of weakening.
The forestproducts and mining industries continue to prosper,
with generous rainfall improving the outlook for farmers.
Unemployment is declining. While new car sales are soft,
overall retail activity looks fairly good. Tourism remains
the brightest spot in the area's economy, with spending
doubling over the past two years. (Minnesota, Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, northern Wisconsin, upper peninsula of
Michigan.)
                                                                                                       

   Kansas City
                                                                                                       

   Growth continues at a moderate pace. Retail sales are
unchanged or slightly higher than a year earlier but mixed
over the past three months. Manufacturing is sluggish.
Housing starts are down from last year but have stabilized
over the past month. Wheat yields are above average across
the area, with Kansas reporting its largest crop on record.
Higher yields, however, should drive down prices and limit
income gains for area farmers. (Western Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, northern New Mexico.)
                                                                                                       

   Dallas

   Slow economic growth continues, with some promising
developments. Retail sales growth is outpacing the rest of
the nation. Construction continues its moderate growth, with
an upturn in both the single and multifamily markets.
Manufacturing presents a mixed picture, with steel,
telecommunications, and refineries reporting higher sales,
while paper, fabricated metal, and some semiconductor
producers reporting weakness in their respective markets. Dry
weather has agricultural producers nervous, with some cotton
growers abandoning their crops. Prices remain high, however,
with livestock indexes up 7%. (Texas, northern Louisiana,
southern New Mexico.)
                                                                                                       

   San Francisco
                                                                                                       

   The West continues to enjoy economic expansion in most
sectors despite some losses in defense industries. The
service sector continues its robust growth, and retailers
report strong growth in several areas. Wages and prices
remain stable, with few rises larger than 4% to 5%.
Construction has slowed from its torrid pace of a year ago
along the California coast, but homes are selling well and
prices are rising in most parts of the West. Manufacturing
and agriculture remain stable, with growth in some
heavy-equipment orders balancing losses in the defense
sector. (California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Utah,
Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.)
