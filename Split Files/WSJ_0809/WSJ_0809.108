   French glass and construction-material concern Cie. de
Saint-Gobain said consolidated revenue grew 2.6% in the first
half to 34 billion francs ($6.4 billion) from 33.2 billion
francs in the 1989 first half.
   The company said sales were virtually flat on a comparable
structural basis. Saint-Gobain attributed the loss to
weakness in the U.S. dollar and the British pound against the
French franc.

   The decline in the dollar hurt the company most, a
spokesman said, because the U.S. unit's loss of about 10%
against its French counterpart severely devalued the
company's U.S. revenue in franc terms, even though the volume
of Saint-Gobain's business in the U.S. market held close to
first-half 1989 levels.
   The spokesman said North American operations accounted for
about 22% of the company's revenue.
