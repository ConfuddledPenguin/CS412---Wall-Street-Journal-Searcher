   NEW YORK -- The U.S. dollar and yen climbed against
European currencies as the standoff in the Persian Gulf
continued, but a crimp in world oil supplies grew less
likely.
   Comments by President Bush during the early New York
trading session that U.S. military forces had been deployed
to Saudi Arabia only for defensive purposes and not to oust
Iraq from Kuwait kept dollar buying from dominating the
foreign exchange market.

   But with little chance of a quick resolution to the
crisis, few bold dollar-sellers emerged. The dollar wavered
above and below 1.5900 marks throughout global trading and
ended in New York at 1.5925 marks, up from 1.5875 marks late
Tuesday. The U.S. unit was unchanged at 1.3385 Swiss francs.
   The yen, which had been the weakest major currency since
Iraq's invasion, gained from profit-taking sparked by an
unsubstantiated rumor in the Asian market that the Bank of
Japan was about to raise the discount interest rate. The
yen's appreciation, especially against the mark, encouraged
stop-loss yen buying when European and North American banks
opened.
   Abigail Cook, a New York vice president for corporate
foreign exchange with Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., said
that technical demand for yen had accumulated since last
Thursday as the Japanese unit declined with hardly a pause.
   Improving attitudes toward the yen were a 3% rebound in
Tokyo stock prices and Iran's announcement it would supply
Japan with 550,000 barrels of oil a day to help make up for
lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti production. Venezuela also said it
could increase its output by as much as 500,000 barrels of
oil a day.
   Late Tuesday, U.S. officials had said Saudi Arabia agreed
to increase its own massive oil production. The Saudis didn't
pledge a specific amount, but the U.S. had been seeking an
additional two million barrels a day, half the normal output
of Iraq and Kuwait.
   The improved world supply picture, combined with
profit-taking, pushed crude oil prices lower yesterday. The
September contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
$2.35 a barrel to $25.96 a barrel.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted
about a yen lower at 149.80 yen, compared with 150.95 yen
late Tuesday. The mark and Swiss franc fell to 94.15 yen and
112.03 yen, respectively, from 95.06 yen and 112.86 yen late
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 149.65 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
150 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5935 marks; in Tokyo Wednesday, it closed at 1.5848 marks.
   "The yen has been like a pingpong ball in a hurricane,"
said Jerry Egan, chief dealer for Bank of Boston.
   Sterling sank to 280.15 yen from 282.41 yen previously.
Late in New York, the pound was also trading at $1.8696, down
from $1.8720 late Tuesday. The British currency, however,
climbed to 2.9753 marks from 2.9710 marks late Tuesday.
   Dollar trading remained agitated and headline driven. A
"deep dichotomy" between dollar-bearish U.S. economic
weakness and dollar-bullish Mideast posturing is "tearing at
the market," Mr. Egan said.
   "The most important thing for the people in the pits is to
not try to explain movements, but to be ready to quote a
price that's not going to lose you money," Mr. Egan said.
"This is one of the most difficult markets I've seen."
   Noted Ms. Cook of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai, "a lot a people are
tuckered out. They just don't have the stamina to keep these
{long-dollar} positions. People are getting really bitter
about holding positions."
   Ms. Cook explained that dealers want to keep enough
dollars to protect themselves from a new military clash, but
that whenever the situation seems to calm down, "you see some
of the big boys trying squeeze out those long-dollar
positions so they can buy dollars cheaper."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $383.20, down $1.30. Estimated volume was
a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$381.75 an ounce.
