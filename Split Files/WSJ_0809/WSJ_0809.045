   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
named Richard S. Bodman senior vice president, strategic
planning and corporate development, effective Aug. 23. Mr.
Bodman, 52 years old, succeeds John Segal, who left last year
to become vice chairman of Contel Corp., the Atlanta-based
telecommunications service company.
   Mr. Bodman is currently president of Washington National
Investment Corp., a Washington, D.C.-based investment firm
that acquires large minority positions in companies with
sales ranging from $50 million to $500 million. His
background reinforces AT&amp;T's recent strategy of making
acquisitions and joint ventures with smaller companies as it
tries to enter new markets. In July, AT&amp;T announced it would
acquire parts of Western Union Corp.'s business services
group, including the EasyLink electronic mail service and
Telex wire service. Last year, it acquired Istel Ltd., a
London-based information services company.

   In addition, Mr. Bodman will be a member of AT&amp;T's
executive committee; the company rarely admits those
recruited from outside to join that committee. An AT&amp;T
spokesman said Chairman Robert E. Allen was "looking for new
perspectives."
