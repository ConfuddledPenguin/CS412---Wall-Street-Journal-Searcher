   American Airlines announced a 10% fare increase, as
expected, making it likely that more major carriers will
boost ticket prices.
   The carrier, a unit of AMR Corp., cited higher jet fuel
prices, which have risen about 20% since July, much of that
coming in the wake of the Iraq crisis.

   Shortly after American's move, Midway Airlines, typically
one of the last carriers to accept a fare rise, said it also
will raise fares 10% starting tomorrow. America West Airlines
said it would do the same, and Southwest Airlines said it
will raise fares slightly. Delta Air Lines, which is also
slow to match increases, said ticket price increases are
"likely."
   Despite American's move, it will take the participation of
Delta, along with other major carriers such as UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines unit and USAir Group for the planned increase
to take effect. Airlines usually don't institute a fare rise
without all other carriers matching it.
   Although oil costs fell yesterday, industry analysts said
the carriers will probably still push through fare increases
since they've been paying higher jet fuel prices for a number
of days.
   A spokeswoman at American said the carrier is still going
ahead with its plans to raise domestic and Caribbean fares
10% tomorrow and to boost international fares Aug. 15. She
said it would take American at least a month to recover from
the additional fuel costs it has already seen.
   There appears to be an appetite for an industrywide fare
increase. "A lot of comptrollers, chief financial officers
and investor relations people at the airlines are
shell-shocked at the increases in fuel prices," said Timothy
Pettee, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
   Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc., said it will delay
until tomorrow an $8 one-way surcharge that it was planning
to implement today. Since no other carrier has matched the
surcharge, it's likely that Northwest will drop it and jump
on board with a 10% fare increase.
   The 10% fare rise was first proposed early this week by
Pan American World Airways, which initially planned for it to
take effect today. The Pan Am Corp. unit is postponing the
effective date until tomorrow, in order to stay in line with
American's action.
   Delta officials were apparently stunned earlier this week
when prices rose five cents a gallon in a single day.
Industry analysts say that a penny increase in aviation fuel
expenses costs the airline industry millions in additional
costs. Fuel costs usually account for at least 12% of an
airline's expenses.
   American said that every one-cent increase in the price of
jet fuel per gallon adds about $2 million a month to its
costs. American uses about 200 million gallons of jet fuel
monthly.
   According to one estimate, the industry faces an
additional $500 million in expenses because of the surge in
fuel costs. Analysts said that a 10% fare rise would probably
recover the incremental cost increases. They added, however,
that such a large increase probably wouldn't stick for the
rest of the year as traffic wanes and airlines resort to
discount promotions to attract fliers.
   In a statement, American said it "wants to be fair with
its customers and we are especially sorry to do this because
we know that higher fares will create hardships for many."
   In fact, the fare increases could backfire if airlines
drive away too many customers during an already sluggish
travel and tourism season.
