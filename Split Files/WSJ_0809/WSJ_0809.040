   NEW YORK -- Crashing oil prices and defensive moves by the
U.S. and other nations against Iraq sent investors running
back to stocks. The threat of war kept the dollar firm
against most currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.26 points to
2734.90.

   The markets rocked again in volatile trading as statements
from President Bush, Iraq, and U.S. military leaders burst
across news wires throughout the day.
   Crude oil futures for September delivery fell $2.35 a
barrel to $25.96 in wild trading. In the stock market, shares
of oil producers plunged as well, but the broad market staged
its first significant gain in six days as investors gained
confidence that higher oil prices would not prevail.
   "The main motor of the stock market -- oil -- was going
the right way," said Edward Laux, head of block trading at
Kidder Peabody. "And investors are going after the stocks
they love to love."
   The year's favorite growth stocks advanced sharply: Home
Depot gained 1 3/8 to 34 3/4; Wal-Mart Stores rose 1 5/8 to
30 1/4, and Motorola jumped 3 1/4 to 76. Investors also
pursued a host of recession resistant companies, such as drug
and consumer concerns.
   "It was a special type of stock that gained -- stocks not
too related to the general economy and that have predictable
earnings," said John McElroy, principal at 1838 Investment
Advisors.
   Many stock investors remain fearless about the economic
outlook. A recession will bring interest rates down and boost
stocks, they argue; the rise in oil prices is strictly
temporary, the investors believe.
   "I can't think of a reason not to buy stocks," said Roger
Engemann, head of a Pasadena, Calif., investment firm that
bears his name. "I welcome a recession as an investment
manager -- it will bring interest rates down." He said such
growth issues as Philip Morris and Eli Lilly are cheap and
investors should buy.
   Meanwhile, bearish strategists can think of every reason
to sell stocks. Richard Hoey, chief U.S. economist at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says the stock market's 25-point
rebound is hardly impressive given the $2 plunge in oil.
   "There are three Bs for the bears: Baghdad, budget and
banking system," said Mr. Hoey. He believes escalating oil
prices will raise mortgage rates, which will be a sharp blow
to consumer confidence. Without consumer spending, economic
growth will slow, giving U.S. budget negotiators a thorny
dilemma: too many spending cuts will push the economy into a
deeper recession; too few will cause long-term bond rates to
shoot higher as the government finances a widening deficit.
   Mr. Hoey also predicted that as the economy softens,
creditors will cut back further on loans and other sources of
funding that many businesses need. He is advising investors
to sell stocks and raise cash.
   The dollar firmed against most major currencies except the
yen. Bassem Snaije, first vice president at Banca della
Svizzera Italiana, said military tension in the Middle East
kept the dollar strong against the West German mark, but
falling oil prices underpinned the yen. Still, he added,
given weak economic growth in the U.S., the dollar's strength
is tenuous.
   "The dollar is a sale one way or another," said Mr.
Snaije. "All we need to know is who is going to win" in the
Middle East.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks finished higher. Advancing issues on the New York
Stock Exchange led decliners 1,015 to 601. Big Board volume
totaled 190,400,000.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained against most currencies. In late New
York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5925 marks and
149.80 yen compared with 1.5875 marks and 150.95 yen late
Tuesday.
