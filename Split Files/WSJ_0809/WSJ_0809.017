   ARLINGTON, Va. -- USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc., said
July traffic rose 4.3% to 3.2 billion revenue passenger miles
from 3.07 billion a year earlier. A revenue passenger mile is
one paying passenger flown one mile.
   The July load factor, or the percentage of available seats
occupied, fell to 62% from 64.8%. USAir said statistics for
1989 periods prior to its merger with Piedmont Airlines Aug.
5, 1989, were restated to reflect the combined airline
operations of both carriers on a pro forma basis.
