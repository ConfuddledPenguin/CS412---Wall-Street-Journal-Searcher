   The following are letters to the editor to Friday, an
Oklahoma newspaper, by Lawrence E. Walsh, independent counsel
for the Iran-Contra prosecutions, and Robert L. Bartley,
editor of The Wall Street Journal. Friday, a weekly with some
18,000 circulation, covers the affluent areas in and around
Oklahoma City, including Nichols Hills, where Mr. Walsh has a
home.
   Mr. Walsh's letter was in response to an article in Friday
headlined "U.S. Top Dollar Prosecutor Is From Our Area,"
which cited L. Gordon Crovitz's May 30 Rule of Law column in
this newspaper, "Lawrence Walsh, Drug Cases and the Costs of
Selective Prosecution."

   Although I appreciate your interest in the work of my
office, I regret your reliance on the speculations of L.
Gordon Crovitz of The Wall Street Journal. He is a young man
who has had essentially no law practice experience and who
has never been responsible for litigation of any importance.
Neither is he a reporter. The Washington press corps, which
is perhaps the best in the world, keeps my office under
continued expert scrutiny. Mr. Crovitz is not a member of
that group, and is, in fact, avoided by the reporters of his
own publication.
   The fallacies of his various comparisons must have been
obvious to you. Essentially, he speculates as to the cost of
supporting government agencies and adds these exaggerated
estimates to the actual expenditures of my office. He then
compares this total with the actual cost of the offices of
United States Attorneys and the New York County District
Attorney without adding a comparable estimate of the cost of
their supporting services -- such as the New York City Police
Department and various government law enforcement agencies
such as the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, etc.
   He also attempts a cost-benefit evaluation based upon the
amount diverted to the Contras. In doing this he confuses the
standards of criminal and civil litigation. In civil
litigation a lawyer evaluates his probable recovery against
the cost of litigation. In criminal cases the recovery of
stolen proceeds is usually not the controlling consideration.
Incidentally, Mr. Crovitz's estimate of the amount of the
diversion is grossly wrong and the amount of probable
recovery is more like $8 million than $3 million.
   The expenses of the FBI and other government agencies
would have been substantially the same no matter who
prosecuted the case. For example, a large part of these
expenses, such as the archivists briefly assigned to the
White House, represent the cost of responding to discovery
demands of the defendant (Lt. Col. Oliver) North. These costs
were in no sense subject to the control of independent
counsel.
   Having said this, there is no question that the
prosecution by independent counsel is more expensive than a
routine prosecution. It is necessary to create a new office
with heavy overhead and the higher salaries of temporary
appointees. This becomes particularly onerous when it is
necessary to collect and store highly classified information.
The standards of security are prescribed by the intelligence
agencies, not infacility for the use of the defendants.
   Opinions may differ as to whether such a costly
prosecution should be undertaken. In this case it was the
opinion of the Reagan Administration -- through the Attorney
General -- and of the appointing court that this should be
done. There were no illusions that it would be cheap. It is
my responsibility to see that it is thorough. Actually, the
expenses of my office are reviewed in detail by the
Administrative Office of the Courts. They are updated each
month for the press. They are reported formally to the
appointing court twice a year.
   It is regrettable that The Wall Street Journal permits an
irresponsible journalist to use its editorial page. Mr.
Crovitz could have checked these facts with my office as more
experienced reporters do with regularity. This information is
equally available to Friday. My office telephone number is
202-383-8953. My home number is, of course, listed in the
Oklahoma City Directory.

   Congratulations on your scoop on Lawrence Walsh's view of
the criticisms of his special prosecutor's office by our L.
Gordon Crovitz. The Wall Street Journal is also willing to
publish letters to the editor from offended officials, but
apparently responding to your story quoting Mr. Crovitz's
column struck Mr. Walsh as more important. While I understand
that you circulate among his wife's social set in Oklahoma,
both his forum and the personal nature of his attacks are at
best curious.
   Before dealing with the latter, a few words on the
substance. In an effort to arrive at an approximation of the
true cost of the Walsh prosecutions, Mr. Crovitz added to the
$20.8 million recorded in Mr. Walsh's office some $7.9
million the Justice Department estimated for indirect costs
such as FBI time. Mr. Walsh complains that in a cost-per-case
comparison with a normal U.S. attorneys' office, indirect
costs for the latter were not included. Mr. Walsh surely also
knows that the comparison was generous to his side in not
including in the case count the large volumes of civil
litigation covered by the budgets of U.S. attorneys. In any
event, I marvel over a mind that wants to nit-pick the
numbers given their result -- $20,242 per defendant for the
U.S. attorney in southern New York versus over $3 million per
defendant by Mr. Walsh.
   I marvel, too, over a mind that commits sentences like ".
. . a young man who has had essentially no law practice
experience and who has never been responsible for litigation
of any importance." Or ". . . is, in fact, avoided by
reporters of his own publication." Or "It is regrettable that
The Wall Street Journal permits an irresponsible journalist
to use its editorial page." One expects such language in
crank letters, not from an attorney holding a position of
responsibility and trust as a high public official.
   For the record, I count saving Mr. Crovitz from the law as
one of my life's accomplishments. He earned a degree in
jurisprudence as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, was the first
editorial page editor for our Wall Street Journal Europe, won
a law degree from Yale while continuing to work half time in
journalism. He is a member of the New York Bar, and got a
taste of law practice when Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, Mr. Walsh's
former Wall Street firm, thought enough of him to take him on
as a summer associate. In his short time there, as it
happens, he helped win a multimillion-dollar case; Robert
Fiske, Mr. Walsh's former partner, has been quoted in the
American Lawyer as saying that Mr. Crovitz was "the driving
force" behind the winning brief. This of course accounts for
the curious phrasing in Mr. Walsh's sentences on legal
experience.
   More to the point, Mr. Crovitz's journalism has become the
talk of the legal community. The New York Bar Association
gave him its first prize in its media awards for three years
in succession: 1987, 1988 and 1989. In the Loeb Awards for
Business and Financial Writing, he took first place in 1990
after having been a finalist or honorable mention in 1987,
1988 and 1989. His writings are often controversial, as an
opinion journalist's are supposed to be, but he is
increasingly recognized as the leading media commentator on
the law.
   By now, of course, the Circuit Court of Appeals has
overturned Mr. Walsh's conviction of Oliver North, and his
Poindexter conviction is jeopardized by similar error,
leaving him with even less to show for our $20.8 million,
$28.7 million or whatever. Mr. Walsh's real problem is not
irresponsible journalism. His problem is that the courts, not
overwhelmed by resumes, are ruling that Mr. Walsh has the law
wrong, and Mr. Crovitz has it right.
