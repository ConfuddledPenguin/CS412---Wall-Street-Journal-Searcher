   Roll-Up Trash Can
   Cuts Down on Waste

   BAG HOG, a new trash container, is better looking than a
plastic barrel, and it devours less of the Earth's resources.
   Made of rugged, recyclable plastic, the Bag Hog is
shipped, stored and sold flat and unpackaged. Instructional
graphics, locking tabs and a quick release system allow the
user to turn flat sheets into cone-shaped containers in
seconds. Trash bags are attached at two keyholes by pushing
the bags through with index fingers.
   Designed by John Lonczak, Tony Baxter and Simon Yan of
John Lonczak Design in New York, the Bag Hog last night
received one of this year's 16 gold awards for design
excellence given by the Industrial Designers Society of
America.
   One juror, Peter Lowe, praised the Bag Hog, which is made
by stamping, for using "less energy to make than a molded
container and less plastic to enclose a given amount of
trash."
   Sold by Form Farm Inc. of New York, the Bag Hog isn't for
every situation. Designer Lonczak advises "discretion" in
using the bottomless product for liquids. And he sees a
"potential problem" in getting Bag Hog to lie flat again
after it's been in use.
                                                                                                       

   Creating a New Recipe
   For Satellite Dishes
                                                                                                       

   HOW DO you get more homeowners to install TV dish antennas
when most dishes are big and ugly? Design one that's small
and beautiful.
   But a smaller antenna on the ground requires a more
powerful satellite. General Electric's Satcom K-1 satellite
has 45 watts, which makes it about twice as powerful as the
competition and able to send quality TV signals to antennas
that are half as big. GE could simply have shrunk a standard
antenna by half. Instead, it opted for a total redesign.
   "The size of a dish is a big deal with homeowners, but so
is its looks," says Joan Fu, an engineer with GE American
Communications in Princeton, N.J. "We hope aesthetically
pleasing antennas will attract customers."
   Charles Keane and Steve Monti of Boston's Gregory Fossella
Design, a McCalla Lackey company, conceived the new antenna,
which last night received an IDSA gold award. The elliptical
dish is 45 inches long. The antenna is designed to be mounted
on the peak of a roof, on a wall or standing free. With 20%
fewer parts, it's less expensive to produce and easier to
install.
   Jury Chairman Gianfranco Zaccai said the new antenna shows
that "it's possible, through sensitive design, to tame a
technological artifact which often litters the landscape of
America."
                                                                                                       

   Gobi Aims to Improve
   Design in Barren Niche
                                                                                                       

   GERALD Hirshberg came away from the meeting "angry and
frustrated." Once again, the Nissan Motor big shots had
argued that an inexpensive car had to be "bland, spartan and
uninteresting." Mr. Hirshberg, a vice president of Nissan
Design International, San Diego, set out to prove his bosses
wrong.
   His anger led to the Gobi car/truck, which Nissan is
considering for production. Designed with the help of Bruce
Campbell and Diane Taraskavage, the Gobi received an IDSA
gold award.
   "Androgynous" is how Mr. Hirshberg likes to describe his
creation. The helicopter-like passenger cocoon seems
feminine, while the rugged, corrugated, fold-down sides of
the cargo bed have a masculine look. Yet Mr. Hirshberg
believes the whole vehicle will appeal to both sexes. "More
and more men are becoming comfortable with the feminine
component in all of us," he says, "and more and more women
are not afraid of changing a tire.
   "I'm sure somebody can find a place for a gun rack in the
Gobi," concludes Mr. Hirshberg, "but I hope they don't."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OTHER gold medal winners included a voting machine that
combines easy access for people in wheelchairs with a simple
set of electronic switches. The machine was designed by James
Bleck, Scott Wakefield and John Thrailkill of Bleck Design in
Chelmsford, Mass., for Sequoia Pacific Systems of Jamestown,
N.Y. . . . A gold medal went to an all-weather stacking chair
designed by Warren Snodgrass and Charles Roth of Design
Technology in Mill Valley, Calif., for Tropitone Furniture,
Irvine, Calif. The chair has a seat and back of perforated
aluminum sheet on a frame of aluminum tube.
