   While Europe was celebrating the liberation of its eastern
wing and the prosperity of its fast-unifying West, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stepped in to rewrite the script.
   As a result, the decade that was supposed to usher in a
radiant future for all Europe now is on shakier ground.

   Faced with rising energy bills, the European Community now
expects slower growth and higher prices -- a recurrence of
the "stagflation" virus that plagued industrial economies in
the 1970s. But those effects seem mild when set against the
potentially devastating blow the Middle East crisis may deal
struggling Eastern Europe.
   For four decades, Eastern Europe was insulated from
fluctuations in energy prices -- including the two big energy
shocks of the 1970s -- by virtue of Soviet oil and gas, which
flowed in at heavily subsidized prices. Now that they're
shifting to market prices and hard-currency payments for
energy, the Eastern Europeans in effect will have to absorb
three energy shocks at once -- the two they missed plus the
one Saddam Hussein set off with his invasion of Kuwait.
   "The Eastern European contracts will switch to
hard-currency accounting with the Soviet Union, and this in
itself will have a severe impact," says Peter Havlik, an
energy specialist with the Vienna Institute for Comparative
Economic Studies. Add to that the price increases arising
from the Middle East crisis, "and it'll have an even greater
negative impact."
   Of course, the consequences for all of Europe depend on
how long the crisis goes on and how high the price of oil
rises. But oil-price increases of some magnitude are
considered inevitable.
   The added pain of higher-than-expected energy costs comes
when the former Soviet satellites are already reeling from
the jolts of moving to market-oriented economies. Fears are
growing that the worsening economic outlook will stir up
social discord in Eastern Europe and make it harder for
governments there to stick with reforms. As a result, the
major industrial nations may well be called upon to beef up
already generous aid programs.
   "The impact of $20-to-$30 a barrel oil prices is
catastrophic for Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, " says David
Roche, European strategist for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
London. "And it increases substantially the costs to West
Germany of supporting a collapsing East German economy."
   The Middle East crisis will probably set back the
still-embryonic programs for cleaning up the East's ravaged
environment. Mr. Havlik of the Austrian economics institute
predicts that expected oil-price increases will force
Czechoslovakia to keep several aging, and possibly unsafe,
nuclear reactors in operation. And throughout Eastern Europe,
brown coal, a major source of sulfurous pollutants, will
continue to be a needed source of energy.
   Eventually, Prague economists speculate, the worsening
economic outlook will push Czechoslovakia to give up its
policy of sticking to a low level of foreign debt. By
contrast, Bulgaria, whose hard-currency earnings could be
completely wiped out by the rise in energy costs, probably
couldn't increase its borrowings if it chose to: It hasn't
been able to keep up with payments on its $10 billion current
foreign debt. Similarly, Poland, staggering under a $40
billion debt, probably won't be able to look to increased
borrowings.
   In Western Europe, the shocks in the oil markets are
decidedly less ominous, but are clouding the economic
optimism of the past three years. Economists are looking for
both higher inflation and lower growth.
   Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, says that
the crisis has shattered the general sense that Europe's
recent good times would go on indefinitely. (The Bank for
International Settlements essentially is the central bank for
the world's central banks.)
   "There's always been a nagging question about how long the
expansion could go on," Mr. Lamfalussy says. "Until these
events, I thought our prospects were quite good. We had a
good engine in Europe and Japan, and a slowdown in the U.S.
that wasn't that worrying. Now the chances of a world-wide
slowdown have increased, and increased in a rather unpleasant
scenario -- with a stagflation side."
   West Germany's Bundesbank, Western Europe's chief guardian
against inflation, insists there's no reason to assume
there'll be a new bout of stagflation. "Our economists say
there shouldn't be a complete revision of their assumptions,"
says an official of the central bank in Frankfurt. "But
there's concern."
   That concern will grow as oil prices rise, private
economists predict. Some time in the fall, many believe, the
Bundesbank will raise interest rates, setting off a similar
round of increases in Europe.
   The Middle East crisis also is expected to complicate the
EC's march toward monetary and economic integration. "This is
going to affect some countries differently from others," says
Thomas Berger, a director in London of Lombard Odier &amp; Cie.,
a Swiss investment concern.
   Spain, Portugal and Italy remain heavily dependent on
imported oil. In addition, the Mediterranean nations haven't
made the strides their northern allies have in pushing
through energy-saving conservation policies.
   Elsewhere, though, "the economies aren't in the same
situation as in 1973 and 1978," says Michel Develle, director
of economics with Banque Paribas in Paris. "The share of oil
in France's total consumption was 69% in 1973 and in 1988
it's 41%. During the same period West Germany's share dropped
from 56% to 41%."
   Britain, an oil producer, stands to increase its oil
revenue. But this advantage may be eclipsed by higher energy
costs that could drive up Britain's already worrisome rate of
inflation, currently nearing 10%. That makes it harder for
the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring down base interest
rates, now at 15%. Thus, Britain may have to put off further
its full entry into the European Monetary System, which links
together the major EC currencies within set bands of
fluctuation.
   After a year of political changes in the East and
expectations in the West, the Middle East crisis will alter
the psychological climate and cramp the flow of investment.
   Europe's robust growth in recent years has been largely
attributed to a boom in capital-spending as companies
restructured and expanded in anticipation of a larger and
more dynamic marketplace in the 1990s. On the heels of Iraq's
invasion, S.G. Warburg warned that as corporate earnings fall
off, there will be "cutbacks in capital spending plans --
especially against a backdrop of continued high interest
rates."
