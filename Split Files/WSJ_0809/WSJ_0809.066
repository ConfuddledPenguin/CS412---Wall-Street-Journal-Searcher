   Members of the American Bar Association's policy-making
body voted to abandon a resolution it adopted only six months
ago that favored abortion rights.
   The ABA's House of Delegates, by a vote of 200 to 188,
instead supported a resolution that acknowledges that
questions related to abortion are "extremely divisive" and
that the ABA, "for the good of the association, will not
adopt a policy supportive of a particular viewpoint."

   It is highly unusual for the ABA, an organization of
365,000 members nationwide, to reverse itself on such a
position. But since delegates voted 238-106 last February in
favor of a resolution supporting a constitutional right to
abortion, there has been a deep split within the ABA over
whether any position should have been adopted. Some 1,500
members have resigned in protest of the pro-abortion
resolution, and more had threatened to do so if it wasn't
repudiated.
   Anthony R. Palermo, a Rochester, N.Y., lawyer who led the
battle to rescind the pro-abortion rights measure, said
yesterday that he is neither "pro-life or pro-choice," but
that he believes the ABA shouldn't become an advocate in the
abortion debate. He said he didn't know how much money had
been donated for the campaign to rescind the policy or from
where the money came.
   However, Chris Robling, a Chicago-based consultant hired
by Mr. Palermo to lobby ABA members, said that Mr. Palermo's
efforts received financial and other support from
anti-abortion lobbying groups. He said the neutrality
advocates had used these groups' mailing lists and telephones
to persuade lawyers to put pressure on delegates. Mr. Robling
estimated that "not more than $50,000" was spent on lobbying
efforts that included a poll conducted by the Wirthlin Group
in Orem, Utah. Opponents said they believed the figure was
considerably higher.
   The ABA's approval of an abortion rights policy had meant
that the organization could file friend-of-the-court briefs
in abortion cases and lobby against legislation cutting back
abortion rights.
   The vote to reverse the ABA's abortion stance came in the
wake of a 885-837 vote on Monday by ABA members to rescind
the abortion rights resolution. That vote, taken by the ABA
assembly, wasn't binding, however. The assembly was open to
any ABA member who had registered to attend the annual
convention in Chicago.
   Before the vote yesterday, delegates listened to almost
three hours of debate. John Curtin Jr., a Boston lawyer who
is the ABA's incoming president, argued that the pro-abortion
rights stance had been too divisive, and that the ABA has "no
new or persuasive insights to add to this debate."
   Sara-Ann Determan, of the Washington law firm Hogan &amp;
Hartson, the ABA member who led the campaign to pass the
resolution last February, urged delegates not to "yield to
pressure on a matter of principle" just because a
"well-financed and highly motivated minority of our members
has dissented."

   EX-BROKER CONVICTED of fraud in over-the-counter stock's
initial offering.
   A jury in federal court in Manhattan convicted Joseph
Tavormina, a former New York stockbroker, of 31 counts of
conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud. Mr. Tavormina
and five co-defendants were accused of fraud in the initial
public offering of Memory Metals Corp., now known as Memry
Corp., in March 1985. They also were accused of manipulating
the stock price of Memory Metals and another over-the-counter
company, Memory Protection Devices Inc., in late 1986 and
early 1987.
   Mr. Tavormina's attorney, Barry Fallick, said his client
plans to appeal. Mr. Tavormina remains free on bail pending
his sentencing before federal judge Kenneth Conboy.
   At the heart of the charges against Mr. Tavormina is an
alleged scheme to artificially inflate the price of the
stocks. Prosecutors alleged that the stock was issued to
certain defendants and their associates to control the price
at which the stock would sell once public trading began. The
stock prices later were boosted through an elaborate system
of fictitious accounts used to trade the stock back and
forth, prosecutors alleged.
   Four of the other defendants have pleaded guilty to
certain charges and have cooperated with the government; the
trial of the last defendant has been delayed for medical
reasons.

   A JUDGE AWARDED FILIPINO seamen $32 million.
   The federal judge in Tacoma, Wash., ordered a Japanese
shipping company to pay the $32 million in back pay and
punitive damages to 21 Filipino seamen who the company
admitted underpaying for voyages between the U.S. and Japan.
It is believed to be the largest wage award ever in a
maritime case.
   Judge Jack Tanner ruled that Delica Shipping Co., a
Panamanian corporation owned by the Japanese shareholders of
Inui Steamship Co., had engaged in "flagrant, malicious,
indifferent and unconscionable" conduct toward the crew of
the Vanuatu-flagged ship.
   The seamen had alleged that they were ordered to sign two
sets of payroll receipts. One showed wages conforming with
international standards; the other showed actual pay, about
80% less.
   The judge awarded $150,000 in back wages, $15 million in
compensatory and penalty wages, and $17 million in punitive
damages. Scott Stickney, a Seattle lawyer for some of the
seamen, said that his clients, who were fired by the company,
were compensated for future lost wages.
   Although all parties in the suit were foreign, U.S. wage
laws are applicable to foreign seamen docked in U.S. ports.
Joseph Stacey, a Seattle lawyer who represented Delica
Shipping, could not be reached for comment.

   MOST CHARGES against a Shuwa Corp. unit are dismissed.
   A state court judge dismissed most of the claims of a
former accountant of Shuwa Corp.'s U.S. unit who alleged that
two top company executives in Los Angeles frequently beat him
at the office.
   An attorney representing the unit, Shuwa Investments
Corp., and its president, said the suit is set for trial in
early September. The trial will be of a single count of
assault and battery for incidents that the accountant alleged
occurred during a one-year period that ended August 1989,
when the suit was filed.
   Accountant Hajime Tanioka, who resigned last year, asserts
that Takaji Kobayashi, Shuwa Investments president, and
Takeshi Shiratori, executive vice president, at various times
kicked him, struck him with fists, and hit him with a
telephone, a calculator and a book.
   The two executives deny the allegations. Mr. Kobayashi's
father is chief of Tokyo-based Shuwa, the parent company.
Closely held Shuwa owns the Arco Towers in Los Angeles and
large office buildings in other U.S. cities.
   Judge Richard A. Lavine ruled on Tuesday that a one-year
statute of limitations invalidated five of the six counts in
Mr. Tanioka's original complaint, said Terry Sanchez, Shuwa
Investments' attorney; he declined to comment on the
remaining count.
   A former secretary to a Shuwa Investments vice president
who is a cousin of Takaji Kobayashi, filed a separate suit in
November 1988 alleging that the vice president committed
battery, harassment and sexual assault. The vice president
has denied the allegations. An attorney for Shuwa in that
suit didn't return telephone calls.

   KEITH HARING ESTATE settled a lawsuit against Playboy.
   The estate of the late pop artist sued Playboy earlier
this year for alleged copyright infringement in reproducing
and selling four of Mr. Haring's works as limited-edition
posters. Under the settlement, Playboy agreed to recall and
stop marketing two of the $225 posters based on Mr. Haring's
"bunny" drawings, but it will be able to continue selling the
other two works.
   Playboy also agreed to include a disclaimer stating that
its reproductions of Mr. Haring's work are "made without the
participation or approval of Keith Haring or his estate."
