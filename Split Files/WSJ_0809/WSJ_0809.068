   New data retrieved from a Nynex Corp. billing system show
that the company paid about $10 million more than it already
disclosed to firms represented at annual "perverts
conventions."
   The new information covering sales between 1984 and 1988
was disclosed as part of a rate case in New York state. It is
being examined by state regulators, law enforcement officials
and other parties to the rate case who have been concerned
about connections between attendance at the bawdy Florida
gatherings and special deals with the company's Materiel
Enterprises purchasing arm. The weeklong Florida parties were
organized through 1988 by a top Nynex purchasing manager, who
was fired that year after a company investigation.

   A Nynex spokesman emphasized that the amount involved is
relatively small compared with the $215 million of goods and
services Materiel Enterprises bought over the 1984-1988
period from all 33 suppliers represented at the perverts
conventions. During that period, Materiel Enterprises' total
purchases amounted to $3.1 billion, much of which went to the
regional phone company's former parent, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   The spokesman said the new data had no statistically
significant effect on a study it released late last month
showing no correlation between suppliers' sales to Materiel
Enterprises and attendance at the Florida gatherings.
   Nevertheless, some "pervert club" companies that Nynex had
said it didn't do business with turned up on the new list of
payments. Other companies, which Nynex officials said had
only tiny transactions with Materiel Enterprises, actually
received payments exceeding $1 million in some years. In all,
about $10 million of payments were tracked on a Materiel
Enterprises billing system, known as Xmap.
   The Nynex spokesman said the Xmap system is used for goods
and services the company uses internally, such as paper clips
or temporary office help. A separate billing system was used
for goods and services that Materiel Enterprises bought for
resale to other Nynex companies.
   The company has labeled the underlying sales data a trade
secret, covered by a protective order in the rate case.
   But interviews and testimony submitted in the rate case
indicate that some unusual payments were made through the
Xmap system. For example, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., auto body
shop whose owner was a friend of Lawrence Friedman -- the
Nynex manager who was fired for organizing the "perverts
conventions" -- received several hundred dollars one year.
Earlier testimony in the rate case indicated the owner had
helped to "arrange for women" to attend the gatherings.
   Other recipients of Nynex payments included a moving
company that hired another ex-Nynex employee who was fired
for his participation in the conventions. The moving company
received payments exceeding $1 million in both 1987 and 1988.
   Scott J. Rafferty, a Nynex whistle-blower who was
dismissed in 1986 when the consulting operation he headed at
Nynex's tiny Telco Research unit was disbanded, said the
additional information flies in the face of earlier rate case
testimony. A redacted version of Mr. Rafferty's supplemental
testimony indicates that all attendees were either affiliated
with Nynex or Nynex suppliers.
   The company spokesman pointed out that company documents
listing suppliers and payments are trade secrets. "We are put
in the position of having to respond to a document" that is
confidential, the Nynex spokesman complained.
   The unearthed billing data weren't included in the 1988
investigation of the perverts conventions conducted by Nynex.
As a result of that probe, Nynex dismissed Mr. Friedman, who
had been a Materiel Enterprises vice president, and John
Marino, who assisted Mr. Friedman in organizing the Florida
parties. Mr. Friedman, who settled a subsequent lawsuit
against the company for $1 million, has moved to Florida.
Nynex disciplined seven other employees who attended the
gatherings, which included women hired to provide
entertainment and sex for attendees. The company has said it
shared the results of the investigation with regulators in
1988.
   The Nynex spokesman said the company hadn't focused on
data from the Xmaps system earlier because it believed that
problems of favoritism among suppliers or harm to customers
would more likely show up in data from its other billing
system, which generally handled larger transactions. A search
of that system indicated no problems, he said.
   In response to its recent problems, Nynex announced last
week that it was setting up a special ethics office and a
review committee. Nynex Chairman William Ferguson also plans
to send letters to employees assuring them that the company
won't retaliate against whistle-blowers.
