   NEW YORK -- The court-appointed administrator overseeing
Manhattan's Fulton Fish Market, one of the largest seafood
markets in the world, said the operation remains rife with
violence and racketeering.
   The administrator, Frank H. Wohl, blamed New York City
authorities for much of the problem. Mr. Wohl, appointed by a
federal judge in 1988 in response to allegations by the U.S.
government that the market is dominated by organized crime,
accused the city of being afraid to enforce the law in the
market.

   "Although the city of New York has ample authority to
regulate the Fulton Fish Market, that authority is almost
entirely unexercised," Mr. Wohl said in his midterm report to
federal Judge Thomas Griesa. "The city has abdicated many of
its municipal responsibilities in the market to whatever
forces choose to exercise control."
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan sued to take over
the fish market in 1987 because of racketeering allegations,
but Judge Griesa rejected that request. Instead, he appointed
the administrator, whose job is to investigate the market for
any signs of mob influence and to help enforce a court order
against racketeering and extortion by any of the private
companies that do business at the market.
   Mr. Wohl also has some rule-making powers. Frustrated with
the city, he said he soon will propose his own regulations to
discourage extortion by unloaders at the market. He also
asked federal prosecutors to pursue fraud charges against
certain wholesalers.
   "To a large extent the racketeering activity in the Fulton
Fish Market simply fills a void left by the absence of any
legitimate organizing authority in the market," Mr. Wohl said
in the report. "The result is a frontier atmosphere, in which
the prevailing attitude is that the Fulton Fish Market is a
sovereign entity where the laws of economic power and
physical force, not the laws of New York City, prevail."
   Mr. Wohl said the city is even afraid to enforce traffic
rules in the market, located near Manhattan's financial
district downtown. Instead, the workers make and enforce the
rules -- allegedly beating a motorist in the face a few weeks
ago with loading hooks, for instance, after a dispute. Mr.
Wohl said that even though the incident occurred on a street
crowded with market workers, no witnesses could be found when
police investigated.
   Mr. Wohl listed several areas in which the city has failed
to exercise its authority. Businesses in the market operate
without valid leases, licenses or permits as required by law,
he said.
   Mr. Wohl said in the report, "City officials have
expressed a concern that city employees wouldn't be safe
performing their functions in the market, and that
law-enforcement officers detailed to protect the city
employees would be subject to the corrupting influence of the
market."
   A spokesman for New York Mayor David Dinkins couldn't be
reached for comment.
