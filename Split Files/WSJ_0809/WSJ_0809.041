   BRUSSELS -- Arbed S.A. of Luxembourg and Cockerill Sambre
S.A. of Belgium said they are discussing a 50-50 joint
venture to combine their production and sales of flatsteel
products.
   The share prices of both companies surged about 10% after
the talks were disclosed.

   "We are seeking a European dimension comparable to that of
British Steel, Usinor-Sacilor and Thyssen," a spokesman for
Cockerill Sambre said. The two companies said bigger scale is
necessary to "assure the future of these activities in terms
of applied research, new technologies and investments."
   The joint venture would have annual sales of around 130
billion Belgian francs ($3.96 billion), about half from each
company. Both companies derive around a third of their sales
from flat-steel products. The two said they would retain
their separate identities and pursue their other activities
independently.
   Within three months, the two companies aim to reach a
preliminary conclusion on whether to pursue the proposed
joint venure.
   Cockerill Sambre is about 85%-owned by Belgium's Walloon
regional government. The Luxembourg government owns about 31%
of the voting rights in Arbed, and Societe Generale de
Belgique S.A. owns 25.5%.
