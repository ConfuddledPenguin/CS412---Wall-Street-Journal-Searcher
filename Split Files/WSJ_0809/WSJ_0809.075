   JERUSALEM -- Saddam Hussein has staked his government's
future on the outcome of the Persian Gulf conflict and
represents a more formidable foe to the West than he did 24
hours ago, according to Middle East analysts in Israel.
   The Iraqi president is unlikely to withdraw from Kuwait,
they say, and he has launched a campaign aimed at other Arab
states that could undermine the attempt at an economic
embargo of Iraq. As part of this campaign, analysts expect
him to step up his invective against Israel and possibly his
military posture as well.

   "Saddam has tied himself to the mast," says Amatzia Baram,
a Haifa University professor and an expert on Iraq. "Either
the ship sails on or he goes down with it."
   The reason the stakes are so high, Mr. Baram says, is that
the Iraqi president's rule is based on "hayba," an Arabic
word that connotes a mixture of terror and reverence. This
means that once his aura of omnipotence is lost, it becomes
possible for rivals to topple him or even for the people to
rise up in the streets against him.
   Saddam Hussein also has raised the ante for his Arab
neighbors. By invoking the Palestinian cause in his statement
about the takeover of Kuwait, and by implying that Kuwait is
a stop on the road to the liberation of Jerusalem, "Saddam is
going over the heads of Arab leaders and straight to the
masses," Mr. Baram says. In fragile governments with a strong
anti-Zionist tradition, such as in Saudi Arabia, this could
force rulers to try to get the West to ease up in its
reprisals against Iraq.
   "The one thing all Arabs still hate much more than Saddam
is Israel," a military source says.
   Saddam Hussein also reiterated his "share-the-wealth"
message, which analysts say is a linchpin of his ambitions in
the region. If he can weather the storm over the seizure of
Kuwait, Saddam Hussein could use his prestige and the wealth
from Kuwait to offer aid to such Arab nations as Egypt while
encouraging dissidents in nations opposed to him, such as
Syria and Saudi Arabia.
   "The question now is who cracks first," says Joseph
Alpher, deputy head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies in Tel Aviv. "If Arabs start wavering, and body bags
start coming home to America along with rising oil prices,
people may question the current U.S. stance."
   Analysts say Saddan Hussein has only until about tomorrow
to go into Saudi Arabia, if he plans to, as the U.S. military
presence there will be too strong after that. But although it
may be militarily feasible for Iraq, analysts here generally
doubt that Baghdad will seek to move against Riyadh.
   They also don't expect Arab leaders to forge a face-saving
compromise whereby Iraq could withdraw from Kuwait while, for
example, holding on to strategic islands or a few billion
dollars.
   The question then becomes, how long can Iraq withstand
Western pressure? Analysts say an economic embargo won't
pinch hard for several months. They also are pessimistic
about the chances of toppling Saddam Hussein from inside
Iraq, where no real underground opposition is believed to
exist. Assassination also would be difficult, as the Iraqi
president is heavily guarded, rarely leaves the nation and
has executed those who show signs of dissenting or of
becoming a rival.
   "He is probably the most paranoid leader in the world
today," says Mr. Baram. He is believed to have survived 10
assassination attempts since 1979. He also weathered an
eight-year war with Iran that cost an estimated half-million
Iraqi lives and brought no tangible gain.
   "Any self-respecting population would have strung him up,"
Mr. Alpher says.
   Israeli military sources also acknowledge that
intelligence on Iraq is less than in other Arab nations. "We
see Jordan, we see Syria, we know them," says a military
source. "But we don't taste Iraq."
   At the same time, the source says, "Iraq is fertile ground
for recruiting people who despise Saddam." Among them are the
country's large Kurdish minority, families of murdered
political dissidents and Shiite Moslems, who make up roughly
half of Iraq's population and who have sometimes chafed under
the rule of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Moslems.
   More likely, analysts say, would be a coup by military or
security officers. If the economic situation becomes
desperate because of the embargo and Iraq finds itself with
few allies, "then people might decide it's a choice between
saving Saddam and saving Iraq," says Mr. Baram. Even so, a
coup might not end Iraq's aggressive stance. "You can chop
off the head but you still have the body," Mr. Baram says,
referring to the army, security services and ruling Baath
Party, all run by Saddam Hussein's friends.
   Some analysts still hope a formula will be found that
allows Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait while saving face. They
say President Hussein has demonstrated an ability to abandon
once-cherished creeds for immediate benefit. For instance, in
the mid-1980s, when Iran appeared close to winning the war,
Saddam Hussein mended fences with Cairo to get much-needed
Egyptian support, despite having led the Arab drive to
isolate Egypt for its earlier peace treaty with Israel. The
Iraqi leader even made conciliatory noises toward Israel to
secure Western backing.
   But with Saddam Hussein and President Bush having thrown
down the gauntlets, few analysts think any middle ground is
left.
   "The ladder has been there waiting, and Saddam has
declined to climb down," says Asher Susser, head of the Dayan
Center for Middle East and African Studies in Tel Aviv. "The
only course now is attrition or collision."
