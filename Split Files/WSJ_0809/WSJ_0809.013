   WASHINGTON -- By comparison with the vast, sprawling
Smithsonian Institution a mile or so away, Tom and Meredith
Hughes's Potato Museum on North Carolina Avenue was -- so to
speak -- small potatoes.
   Yet where else were its 500-plus visitors a year likely to
encounter a 4,000-year-old Peruvian potato? Or a sendup of
"Olympia," Manet's portrait of a reclining nude, with a
potato -- nude, naturally -- replacing the female model? Or a
rare copy of Carl Claudius's privately published 1954 opus,
"Vicissitudes of an Esculent," with this matchless tribute:

   "Wipe out apple, apricot,
   Yam, and peanut, and tomato:
   World would wig but long could not
   Wag along without potato]"
                                                                                                       

   Alas, the world must wag along without the Potato Museum.
It closed in June, when Mr. and Mrs. Hughes's landlady
reclaimed the three-story townhouse they had rented to house
it. Unless the Hugheses can recruit moneyed sponsors, the
unique institution may remain closed.
   The Hugheses insist they aren't fanatics. They just happen
to love potatoes.
   They once traveled through the Ardennes forest in Belgium
to locate a farmer who grew an unusual hand-shaped variety of
potato, the "Coene di Gatte" (Walloon for "Cat's Paw"). They
had to provide the name of a mutual aquaintance before the
farmer would admit that he grew the rare breed, so suspicious
was he of potato espionage.
   They've tracked the legend of Potato Creek Johnny, who
supposedly found the biggest gold nugget ever unearthed in
the neighborhood of Deadwood, S.D.; traversed Andean peaks to
see the birthplace of potato cultivation; and visited an
Australian-built potato chip factory in remote southwest
China in search of ever more exotic potato lore. In Mr.
Hughes's analysis, the potato is even responsible for the
fall of communism in Eastern Europe.
   "The Poles feed about half of their potato crop to their
animals," Mr. Hughes, who is 45, explains. "The potato crop
failed because they have no blight-resistant potatoes, so
they had to slaughter a lot of their animals. The meat that
was left went out of the country to get export money, so the
people had no meat, which led to the huge shortages, which
led to the strikes and the rise of the Solidarity movement."
   For 15 years, the Hugheses engaged in a labor of love as
organizers and curators of the Potato Museum. Mr. Hughes, a
fifth-grade teacher, began collecting potato curiosities in
Europe. He and his wife, living in Belgium, were fascinated
by the Belgians' affection for the potato and its prominence
in their diet. When they read in a newspaper that Ireland
didn't but should have a Potato Museum, they decided to found
one.
   Their museum's library contained more than 350 books,
including the seminal "The History and Social Significance of
the Potato," by Redcliffe N. Salaman, first published in 1949
by Cambridge University Press. The museum displayed old and
rare potatoes, completely dehydrated. Visitors were asked to
make donations of $2.50 for each adult and $1 per child. The
Hugheses gave guided tours.
   But keeping the museum going was tough. "We were asking of
ourselves not only to be administrators and tour guides, but
professional development people," Mr. Hughes says. "When the
landlady wanted her house back, it was sort of a relief." The
Hugheses have stored the museum's contents in the basement of
their home in Great Falls, Va.
   The couple figures the logical sponsor of a new museum
would be the potato industry, but the industry seems cool.
"Collecting memorabilia, though interesting, is not the
efficient way to promote potatoes," says Robert Mercer,
president of the National Potato Promotion Board. "We've
never really considered it."
   The Hugheses have made repeated requests for support, both
moral and financial, from companies such as H.J. Heinz Co.'s
Ore-Ida Foods division, but to no avail. "It's baffling how
you can send out a proposal to a big corporation and hear
nothing," Mrs. Hughes, 44, says. But Sue Gearhart, a
spokesperson for Ore-Ida in Boise, Idaho, says the Hughes
proposal, submitted this spring, will be considered at a
meeting yet unscheduled of the company's donations committee.
   The lack of support has left the Hugheses steaming. "If
they've taken a small-potatoes mentality to all of this,
we're not," says Mr. Hughes, who sees the industry misgivings
as half-baked: "Their marketing notion is that you back up
the truck to the store, and you dump the potatoes off, and
that's it.
   "We are talking to your customers all the time about the
potato," Mrs. Hughes adds with obvious agitation. "Come on]
Wake up]"
   The Hugheses have attracted some support. One fellow
'tater touter is Jean-Louis Palladin, owner and chef of the
exclusive Jean-Louis restaurant here. To extol the "pomme de
terre's" virtues for a Japanese documentary-film team, he
once prepared a seven-course meal, from appetizer to dessert,
with potatoes central to every dish. Dessert, if you're
wondering, was sweet-potato sorbet with candied sweet
potatoes.
   John Niederhauser, this year's recipient of the
prestigious World Food Prize for his work on creating new
types of blight-resistant potatoes, sits on the board of
trustees of the Potato Museum. Other museum trustees are F.
Lane Heard III, a partner in the Washington law firm of
Williams &amp; Connolly; Charles G. Burck, a Fortune magazine
editor, and Merle Jensen of the University of Arizona,
designer of the Land Pavilion at Disneyworld's Epcot Center.
   Prof. Jensen thinks a sponsor will eventually be found.
"It's just mind-boggling that that person hasn't come
forward," he says.
   The Hugheses have heard from several communities
interested in attracting the museum. Money is the sticking
point. "They view us as eccentric millionaires who somehow
don't need to be paid," Mrs. Hughes says, although in fact
the Hugheses are middle-income. Would-be suitors have
included Monte Vista, Colo., Grafton, N.D., and Shannon,
Ireland. The latest entrant is the Kensington area on
Canada's Prince Edward Island. "I was quite impressed with my
conversations with Mrs. Hughes," says Heather Mountain of the
Kensington and Area Chamber of Commerce. "They have a passion
about the potato and everything about the potato."
   The Hugheses still publish several hundred copies of each
edition of "Peelings," the newsletter for museum members, and
are busy preparing a potato display for a Smithsonian
Institution exhibit about the legacy of the European
discovery of America. They also continue to pursue their
ultimate dream -- "the fireworks at the end of the picnic,"
Mr. Hughes says -- a World Food Museum.
   The idea is for a federation of many community-based
museums built to glorify the world's foods, of which the
Potato Museum would be only a part. A "Disney or Epcot-type
experience," Mr. Hughes says, it would include exhibits,
simulated food rituals from around the world and a restaurant
where patrons could pick their own food, watch it being
prepared and eat it. Until then, the Hugheses intend to
broaden their own horizons. "Next," Mr. Hughes says, "we're
going on to tomatoes."
