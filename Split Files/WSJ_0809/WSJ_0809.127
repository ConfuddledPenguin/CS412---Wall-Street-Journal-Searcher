   NEW YORK -- Continental Corp., an insurer, reported that
its second-quarter net income plunged 96% to $2.5 million, or
two cents a share, from $65.2 million, or $1.18 a share, a
year earlier.
   The company blamed the continued weak pricing environment
in the property-casualty segment of the insurance industry
for the sharp decline in earnings. Continental also said
realized capital losses and higher underwriting losses
contributed to the profit drop. It posted a realized pretax
capital loss of $11.8 million in the second quarter, compared
with a realized gain of $37.4 million a year earlier.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Continental shares closed at $26.75, down 37.5 cents.
   The soft pricing cycle has hurt other property-casualty
companies. But Udayan Ghose, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Continental's outlook is worse, because it
still sells primarily basic property-casualty insurance, and
it hasn't been entirely successful in carving out a regional
or product niche for itself in recent years.
   Mr. Ghose noted the weak earnings and negative cash flow
are draining Continental's capital, forcing it to pay its
hefty $2.60-a-share quarterly dividend out of surplus, rather
than earnings. The insurer hasn't covered its quarterly
dividend payments from earnings since 1987, the analyst said.
Yesterday, Mr. Ghose reduced his estimates for 1990 earnings
by 30 cents, to 90 cents a share, and for 1991 net income to
90 cents a share from $1.70.
   Continental's net for the first six months fell 68% to
$34.7 million, or 60 cents a share, from $109.4 million, or
$1.98 a share, a year earlier.
