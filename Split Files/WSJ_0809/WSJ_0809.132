   Standard Chartered PLC of Britain, a banking concern,
posted first-half pretax profit of #110 million ($206.1
million), or 14.4 pence a share, which was in line with
market estimates and marks a modest turnaround from a loss of
#47.6 million, or 30 pence a share, a year earlier, when
results were hurt by extensive provisions for loans for
less-developed countries.
   Pretax profit was aided by a net reduction in total
developing-country provisions to #775 million from #876.1
million a year earlier. Pretax earnings before these
provisions fell 8% to #192 million from #208.2 million. But
pretax profit growth was held in check by tighter interest
margins, Third World loan sales, and relatively flat
operating results from African and Middle East operations, as
well as provisions against British corporate loans and some
troubles with advances in Australia and Hong Kong. The bank
had issued a series of profit warnings this year, largely
because of its exposure to some troubled British corporate
borrowers.
