   Kenneth H. Bacon's July 23 article on drug-abuse treatment
so clearly points out the need for a re-evaluation of the
approach to funding treatment.
   I have a 19-year-old son who is making remarkable progress
in his recovery from drug addiction and alcoholism through
the efforts of the Straight New England program in Stoughton,
Mass. Yet, despite the fact that he (and our family) will get
a year's intensive treatment, much of it the functional
equivalent of conventional inpatient treatment, for a cost
comparable with 60 days of traditional residential programs,
and despite the fact that the rate of sobriety among
adolescents two years after graduation from Straight is at
least as good as conventional treatment, it has been
impossible so far to get significant reimbursement from my
company's health insurer.

   As Mr. Bacon's article points out, adolescents need longer
treatment than adults; programs like Straight New England
provide this treatment at reasonable cost.
   The insurance-reimbursement process seems to create an
incentive to look first to conventional treatment, even if
it's neither clinically more effective nor preferred by
client or family.
   Only after exhausting available benefits is there a
(financial) reason to try a clinically and economically
effective nontraditional program such as Straight New
England.
   This is a waste. And all it requires to be rectified is a
willingness and procedure for insurers to evaluate and accept
evolving cost and clinically effective treatment programs
promptly.
