   Consumers are steaming over the unprecedented gasoline
price run-up that began literally overnight following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait last week.
   Since Aug. 1, pump prices have jumped more than 16 cents a
gallon to an average of $1.24 a gallon. Each day at that
level costs U.S. motorists about $50 million more than before
the Middle East crisis began.

   Politicians berated oil-industry executives in hearings on
Capitol Hill Tuesday. And yesterday morning President Bush
publicly admonished oil companies to do their "fair share"
during the crisis to "show restraint" with gasoline prices.
Still, despite all the furor, considerable confusion remains
about just who did what and why -- and what might happen at
the gasoline pump next.
   Here are some commonly asked questions:
                                                                                                       

   Q: Oil prices fell sharply yesterday, so can we expect
gasoline pump prices to fall overnight the way they rose
overnight?
   A: Not that fast. It looks like some are headed down, but
don't rush out looking for a bargain everywhere this morning.
Gasoline in the commodity market fell more than six cents a
gallon yesterday, and Phillips Petroleum Co. cut wholesale
prices some yesterday. Atlantic Richfield promised to freeze
prices for a week. BP and Chevron Corp. say they are holding
for now.
   Don't look for huge declines, though. You may think you
have been gouged by the price run-up, but oil companies think
you have been lucky. They say crude prices jumped as much as
$10 a barrel since early July; that should translate into at
least a 25-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline prices once the
crude is refined. So by that reckoning, prices still aren't
up enough.
   But back to the price-lag question. "Retail prices go up
much faster than they come down," says a spokesman for the
Automobile Association of America. And he's right. Some
experts suggest that's because it's generally a dramatic news
event that triggers an upswing and the slow-moving
marketplace that brings prices down. If the marketplace lets
a company hold onto a higher price, it does.
                                                                                                       

   Q: It sure sounds like oil companies are ripping us off;
are they?
   A: There's no doubt Big Oil is making a lot more money now
than a month ago, mostly because it's selling its crude for a
lot more money. Its refinery profit margins of well over $4 a
barrel are also high right now, because it is, indeed,
selling high-priced gasoline that was made with $18 crude
instead of $28 crude. But oil companies are telling the truth
about what happened at the pump; competition actually
restrained gasoline price increases until the Iraqi invasion.
In July, companies weren't able to pass along rising crude
costs into gasoline pump prices.
   Third-quarter and especially fourth-quarter profits could
be enormous if these market conditions last, but companies
may try to mask some of that surge. "All the companies have a
huge piggy bank that allows them to hide gains of an
extraordinary type" in their earnings reports, says Bernard
Picchi, a Salomon Brothers Inc. oil analyst, referring to oil
companies' ability to take certain charges at times of their
choosing.
   At the retail level, location can determine whether
dealers are experiencing a windfall. "If he doesn't feel any
competition, he's free to charge whatever he wants to
charge," Mr. Picchi says. But if a dealer is competing
against a company-owned service station in a heavy-traffic
area, odds are he's facing some price heat and his margin may
actually have been cut by the price rises.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What can I do about all this?
   A: A few things could ease your pain. If you're buying
higher-priced, high-octane gasoline, check the owner's
manual. You might be pleased to discover you don't need it.
Octane of 87 is sufficient for the vast majority of cars on
the road today, auto makers say. The price difference between
regular unleaded and super unleaded can be as high as 20
cents a gallon, so if you drop all the way from premium to
regular, you've eliminated all of the recent price boost.
Voila -- and your car is still happy.
   About 30% of all gasoline sold is super unleaded; "oil
companies are really making a killing" on that growing
consumer habit, Mr. Picchi says. He figures motorists are
unnecessarily "octaning up" to the tune of $3.8 billion a
year.
   Obviously, you can also keep an eye out for the cheapest
station regardless of the brand. There are still many local,
cut-rate brands around. And you usually don't have to worry:
"Gasoline is gasoline," Mr. Picchi says. In fact, it's common
for one company to sell another company's gasoline under its
own brand name, and for off-brand stations to buy from
brand-name refiners.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Why don't companies wait to raise prices until that
higher-priced crude actually arrives as gasoline at the
corner service station?
   A: Companies say they must base their gasoline prices on
the "replacement cost" of the crude oil they are buying in
today's markets. About two-thirds of all the oil imported to
the U.S. is priced at a "spot market" cost once it hits U.S.
shores, so companies are immediately paying for higher-priced
crudes to fuel their refineries. "People think oil prices
take 60 days to pass through the system, but that's not the
case," says Ken Miller, a senior principal at the consulting
firm Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. in Houston.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Do oil companies talk to each other about price?
   A: God forbid, they say. "We have no conversations with
other oil companies on price," says Robert Rauscher,
marketing vice president for Amoco Corp. "We make doggone
certain we don't even come close." One public relations
executive for a major oil company says he was lectured for
several hours earlier this week by company lawyers on
antitrust law. "They're absolutely paranoid about signaling
price changes," the executive says. "It's a very sensitive
and real issue."
                                                                                                       

   Q: How come gasoline prices moved up seemingly in unison?
   A: The gasoline market, like the crude oil market, is an
international commodity market, and prices have surged across
the globe for the same reason in each -- fear of supply
disruption. Traders looking at computer screens from New York
to Singapore, as well as giant companies, big wholesalers and
even corner service stations, all know the up-to-the-minute
price. "We look at gasoline prices every day," says Amoco's
Mr. Rauscher.
   At corner service stations, the cause is a little
different. They generally don't have much inventory and get
new shipments often. "The average guy in the corner station
has a supply of less than a week," Mr. Rauscher says. "The
product moves through {the entire system} very rapidly." So
when the truck arrives and the station operator has to pay
more immediately, he raises his price accordingly -- and
immediately.
   In addition, gasoline imports play a big role. The U.S.
imports about 16.8 million gallons of gasoline a day from
places like Europe and South America, and most of the time
when it arrives here, it commands the spot commodity-market
price, not the price that prevailed when it left home. Plus,
some gasoline-exporters now are holding onto inventories,
driving the price of foreign gasoline up more. Europeans in
particular, says Mr. Miller of Purvin &amp; Gertz, "are going to
be holding onto their own {gasoline} there."
                                                                                                       

   Q: Couldn't a company hold the line or undercut its
competitors and try to gain market share?
   A: It could, but most experts agree that would be risky.
If a refiner's wholesale price is way below everybody else's,
then every dealer in town could head for that terminal to buy
gasoline, creating a run on supply.
   BP learned that the hard way on a small scale this week.
"I was out of line in price in Toledo, Ohio, and my terminal
was cleaned out," says Hugh Hanna, senior vice president for
retail marketing for BP America Inc. All it took was a gap of
five cents per gallon. What hurt even more is that five of
BP's retail stations weren't able to get any gas from the
terminal and had to close, Mr. Hanna says. "It's a very, very
small example that could be magnified all over the world."
   The same holds if a corner station sets a significantly
lower price; word travels fast. That dealer would get a ton
of business -- maybe even have lines at the pumps -- until he
ran out. Then he'd be out of business. If he couldn't buy,
beg or borrow more, a tough proposition in this market, he'd
risk alienating regular customers.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Shouldn't Washington lawmakers carry a big stick and
just legislate gasoline pricing?
   A: "They can legislate all they want," BP's Mr. Hanna
says. "But as long as we're dependent on imported crude, the
world will determine what the price will be." If lawmakers
try to set prices that are below world market prices, then
the U.S. simply "won't get any," Mr. Hanna says. Mr. Picchi
of Salomon Brothers recalls that gasoline price and
allocation controls of the 1970s actually caused shortages in
some areas.
