   KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Upjohn Co.'s hypnotic Halcion drug,
under fire from critics who say it has serious negative side
effects, will carry a "more prominent" label warning of
possible amnesia side effects.
   However, a committee of the Food and Drug Administration
declined, for now, to order stronger measures in response to
reports that Halcion, one of Upjohn's leading products,
causes unusual levels of anxiety, insomnia, hallucinations or
amnesia.

   A company spokeswoman said Upjohn "is very pleased with
the outcome" of the FDA study. "We felt confident that the
review underscores the safety of Halcion," she said.
   In a recent report, the FDA advisory committee said "it
wasn't clear that the actual incidence of adverse reactions
with Halcion was higher except for amnesia."
   As a result, the committee recommended that the "physician
label warning regarding amnesia be strengthened to emphasize
that this seemed to be a greater risk with Halcion."
   The committee added: "The types of adverse events being
reported were common to the sedative/hypnotic class of drugs,
as well as to alcohol, and aren't specific to Halcion."
   Possible amnesia side effects are already mentioned in the
product's label warning. But an FDA spokeswoman said the
committee "wants to see it a little more prominent and in
more detail." Language for that item is pending FDA approval.
   While the FDA's findings should help allay some concerns
surrounding Halcion, the FDA must also address a petition
submitted by the Public Citizen's Health Research Group of
Washington, D.C., that asks the agency to revise Halcion's
labeling and accuses the FDA of "suppressing" or "ignoring"
reports of the side effects.
   The FDA spokeswoman said the agency hasn't responded to
the group's petition.
