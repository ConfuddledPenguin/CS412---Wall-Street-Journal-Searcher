   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. -- Tyco Toys Inc. said it will offer $1
a share for the approximately 1.3 million shares outstanding
of Nasta International Inc. that Tyco doesn't already own.
   Tyco said it would commence next week a tender offer to
shareholders of Nasta, a New York-based maker of lower-priced
toys. Tyco, which recently increased its Nasta ownership to
74% from 63%, said it has withdrawn a previously announced
merger proposal.

   The toy maker also said it intends to offer to exchange a
new issue of Tyco 10-year 8% subordinated debentures for
Nasta's $7.5 million principal amount of 12% convertible
subordinated debentures outstanding. Agreement in principle
has been reached for the exchange of more than $3 million of
the Nasta debentures.
