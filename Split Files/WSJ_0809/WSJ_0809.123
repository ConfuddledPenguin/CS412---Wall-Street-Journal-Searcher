   Japanese buyers of U.S. companies are increasingly
preferring to ride in the back seat rather than take the
driver's seat.
   After displaying a marked preference for obtaining
controlling stakes in U.S. companies, Japanese corporate
buyers are more willing to accept minority equity positions
when investing in the U.S.

   Of 103 takeovers and related transactions in the first
half of this year, 42, or 41%, were minority investments,
according to Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York-based merchant
bank specializing in Japanese investments. That compares with
29 minority investments in the comparable period of 1989 and
nine for 1988.
   Overall, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. continued
to grow: Japanese investors paid $3.91 billion for their 103
publicly reported acquisitions and investments. That's up 39%
from $2.79 billion for stakes in 74 U.S. companies in the
first half of 1989, according to an Ulmer Brothers report.
   However, analysts noted that the amount was still below
the $5.99 billion that the Japanese invested in U.S.
companies in the first half of 1988. Moreover, some said
there was a good chance that investment for 1990 would be
below the $13.7 billion total for 1989. They noted that
Japanese companies have shown a growing appetite for
acquisitions in Europe and Asia.
   Japanese portfolio investment in American securities has
also been falling. In the first quarter, Japanese investors
sold a net $700 million of U.S. stocks and unloaded $3.9
billion of U.S. Treasury securities. Analysts believe the
trend has continued since then.
   Japanese foreign portfolio investment, which involves the
buying and selling of stocks and bonds, is normally much more
volatile than their overseas investments in companies, which
tend to be long-term.
   "Political sensitivity is the prime factor for the
increase in minority stakes," said Ko-Yung Tung, a New
York-based partner at O'Melveny &amp; Myers who specializes in
U.S.-Japanese business. He added that Japanese government
officials have been jawboning Japanese companies "to have a
lower profile in foreign investments, particularly in the
U.S."
   Mr. Tung said, "We have gone from trade friction to
investment friction." The root cause of this tension lies in
the expanding overall presence of Japanese multinational
corporations in the U.S.
   But Mr. Tung said the most recent strains can be
attributed to "the one-two punch" of Sony Corp.'s $3.45
billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
late last year followed immediately by Mitsubishi Estate
Co.'s purchase of 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. for $846
million. That gave Mitsubishi a minority stake in Rockefeller
Center in New York.
   In addition, some earlier big Japanese investments haven't
worked out so well, contend analysts. "Some Japanese
companies have found that they simply paid too high a price
for U.S. acquisitions, something that has also been noticed
by the Japanese corporate community at large," said Daniel M.
Schwartz, managing director at Ulmer Brothers.
   For instance, he said that many American investment
bankers contend that Bridgestone Corp. paid too much in its
$2.6 billion acquisition of Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in
1988. Shortly after the deal closed, a major Firestone
customer, General Motors Corp., began phasing out the tire
maker as a supplier, except for the new Saturn division.
   Another factor is that more small and medium-sized
Japanese companies are investing abroad for the first time.
That, Mr. Schwartz said, accounts for the increase in smaller
transactions, especially those valued at less than $20
million, as well as the growth in minority investments.
Japanese companies, even very big ones, often prefer to
experiment with an initial small investment when venturing
overseas for the first time.
   Overall, Japanese merger activity in the first half
concentrated on the computer industry, followed by chemicals
and financial services. California, accounting for 31 deals,
remained the most popular investment location, followed by
New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Massachusetts, Hawaii and
New Jersey.
   Despite this healthy pace, Mr. Tung of O'Melveny &amp; Myers
and others believe that by year end the picture may change.
They contend that while the number of Japanese acquisitions
and investments in the U.S. will remain the same or increase,
their dollar value will decline.
   They say the aggregate value of all transactions can be
skewed by a single mega-deal. And "these transactions are so
visible that many Japanese companies are loath to make these
kind of investments in the U.S.," said Mr. Tung. "Rather than
being accused of taking over corporate America, they will
take a lesser percentage to appear as co-investors with
Americans."
   Moreover, merger experts said Japan's corporations are
increasingly turning their attention to Europe to take
advantage of the planned abolition of trade and investment
barriers between the 12 countries of the European Community
in 1992 and the recent opening of Eastern Europe.
   "The bloom is off the flower in terms of Japanese
investment in the U.S.; they're tired of America already,"
said Mr. Tung. Besides Europe, he said, Japanese companies
are increasing their direct investment in Asia, "their
backyard." He pointed specifically to Japanese investment in
Thailand and to Japan's increased reliance on Indonesia as a
supplier of oil.
   Mr. Schwartz argued that "the U.S. will remain the major
recipient of Japanese overseas acquisition funds, but
European candidates are looming larger in the minds of
potential Japanese acquirers."
