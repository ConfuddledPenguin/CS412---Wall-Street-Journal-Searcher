   Over-the-counter stocks regained some more ground as
investors took advantage of the OTC market's recent steep
losses to buy shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 5.65 to 407.73, a 1.4%
gain, compared with a 0.9% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Advancing stocks again outpaced decliners, 1,225 to
729, as volume eased to 144.8 million from 165.5 million
Tuesday.

   Virtually all sectors of the OTC market advanced. The
Nasdaq 100 index jumped 5.85 to 411.16, and smaller
technology, industrial and utility issues also continued
recovering some of their recent losses.
   Despite nervousness about developments in the Middle East,
investors stepped in to buy stocks that are much cheaper than
they were a week ago, said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. "There are
opportunities in selected names," he said, adding that both
small and large investors were shopping among a broad array
of stocks.
   Michael Phillips, an OTC trader with Interstate-Johnson
Lane, Charlotte, N.C., said those traders who had sold
borrowed stock, in anticipation of price declines, began
buying shares to repay their loans late in the day.
   "About 3 p.m. {EDT}, people started to get a little
nervous about their short {positions}," Mr. Phillips said. He
added that traders kept a close watch on news from the Middle
East, but said that they seemed to be growing accustomed to
the crisis.
   Microsoft rebounded 2 1/4 to 63 1/2 amid positive comments
from analysts and a general advance among technology issues.
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Scott H. Smith restored
the Redmond, Wash., software maker to the brokerage firm's
list of stocks recommended to buy, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Mr. Smith, who removed the stock from the list in May
because of its price, also upgraded his investment opinion on
Microsoft to "buy" from "moderately attractive," DJPIR said.
An assistant to Mr. Smith said the analyst expects the
company's new products and global marketing strategy will
contribute to a 30% growth rate in fiscal 1992 and 1993, even
if the U.S. economy enters a mild recession.
   First Boston analyst Charles R. Wolf also was said to have
raised his rating on Microsoft to "buy" from "hold."
   Among other technology stocks, Sun Microsystems rose 1 5/8
to 30 1/4; Conner Peripherals added 5/8 to 23 1/2; Novell
gained 2 1/4 to 45 7/8; Oracle Systems ascended 1 1/8 to 16;
Apple Computer climbed 5/8 to 40 1/8, and Adobe Systems
advanced 3/4 to 30.
   Other technology issues were mixed: Intel fell 3/4 to 37
1/8; Seagate Technology eased 1/8 to 11, and Software
Toolworks slid 1/8 to 11 3/8. The Nasdaq Industrial Index
rose 7.53 to 436.54.
   Earnings reports fueled rises in several stocks. Scitex
surged 3 3/8 to 37 after the Israeli computer-graphics
concern reported net income of $1.02 a share in the second
quarter from 40 cents a year earlier. The stock rebounded 2
3/8 Tuesday after falling sharply because of the Mideast
crisis.
   Integrated Waste Services rose 1 to 7 1/8 after the
waste-management concern reported that second-quarter net
income doubled to 10 cents a share.
   Candela Laser jumped 3 3/4 to 16 3/4 after the Wayland,
Mass., maker of medical lasers reported operating income for
the fourth quarter ended June 30 climbed to 24 cents a share
from nine cents a year earlier.
   Bullish comments also sparked a 5/8 jump in Medco
Containment Services to 24 1/8. Charles Mele, general counsel
of the Fair Lawn, N.J., provider of prescription drug
mail-service programs, tied the rise to comments by Merrill
Lynch analyst Richard Vietor, according to DJPIR. Mr. Vietor
repeated a "buy" opinion on the stock and called it the
brokerage firm's "Focus Stock of the Week."
   Good Guys rebounded 4 1/2 to 22, regaining most of the
ground the stock lost since last Wednesday, when it closed at
23. Analysts told DJPIR they weren't aware of any
developments at the Burlingame, Calif., specialty retailer to
explain the gain, but said Good Guys' sales appear to be
strong.
   Altera rose 3/4 to 11 1/2 after the San Jose, Calif.,
maker of integrated circuits said it plans to withdraw a
proposed offering of 2.5 million shares of its common stock
because of unfavorable market conditions.
   United Healthcare eased 3/4 to 16 5/8, despite reporting
Tuesday that net income rose to 32 cents a share in the
second quarter from 14 cents a year earlier. However, this
newspaper reported yesterday that United Healthcare's
chairman, Kenneth Simmons, recently sold all of his holdings
in the Minnetonka, Minn., health maintenance organization.
   Equity Oil fell 3/8 to 6 5/8 after the Salt Lake City oil
company reported a loss of 11 cents a share for the second
quarter, compared with net income of two cents a year
earlier. The company said the second-quarter loss was due to
a non-cash charge of $1.96 million from the abandonment of
two wells in Pecos County, Texas, and a non-cash charge to
leasehold abandonments of $336,000.
