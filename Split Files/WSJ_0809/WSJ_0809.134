   Oil heir Gordon Getty and the Fisher real-estate family
have acquired an additional 1,223,508 shares of Avon Products
Inc., New York, the giant cosmetics and gifts company, for
$45.9 million, or $37.50 per share.
   Mr. Getty and the Fisher family of New York, acting as
Malakand Associates L.P., bought the Avon holdings as part of
an agreement previously reached with L/J Partnership on July
5. L/J Partnership is controlled by Minneapolis investor
Irwin Jacobs and Amway Corp., a direct-selling company in
Ada, Mich. It is unclear whether L/J Partnership continues to
own any Avon shares.

   Mr. Getty and the Fisher family, together with Argonaut
Partners 1, are partners of Chartwell Associates L.P., Avon's
largest shareholder. Argonaut, whose general partners include
Richard Rogers, Mary Kay Corp. chairman; and John Rochon,
Mary Kay's vice chairman, declined to exercise its option to
acquire the 1,233,508 shares of Avon from L/J Partnership.
   Chartwell now controls 19.8% of Avon's common and
preferred shares, slightly below the 20% level at which
Avon's share rights plan is activated. In composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Avon's shares
closed at $33.25 up 87.5 cents.
