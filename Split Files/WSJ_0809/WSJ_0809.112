   As the air fills with predictions of economic downturn,
the Mitchell Recession may soon be upon us. But by now it may
have some Republican fingerprints on it; we'll have to call
it the Budget Summit Recession.
   We started talking of the Mitchell Recession last year,
when the Senate majority leader personally stopped a cut in
the capital-gains tax. Now a slowdown has indisputably set
in, but the only lesson Washington seems to draw is that it
could be tough sledding for the hallowed budget summit's
agenda: higher taxes (for sure) and (maybe) spending cuts.
And now, Senator Mitchell has done it again. He stopped the
World's Greatest Deliberative Body from even holding a vote
on cutting the capital-gains tax.

   We, and others who predicted tax cuts would produce the
'80's recovery, believe a cut in the capital-gains rate would
be the fastest way to jump-start the sagging economy. And
last Saturday, GOP Senators Bob Kasten and Connie Mack,
joined by Democratic Senator Richard Shelby, wanted to offer
a simple amendment to a bill raising the debt ceiling: Cut
the capital-gains tax to 15% after a one-year holding period.
   Senator Mitchell brought up a bill for a long-term
increase in the debt ceiling, but asked for unanimous consent
that no substantive amendments be allowed. Senator Kasten
objected, saying he wished to bring up capital gains. So
Senator Mitchell withdrew the long-term bill, and asked for
approval of an alternate for a short-term extension through
October 15. Since the House was on the verge of recessing for
a month and some debt-limit bill was essential, Senator
Kasten had to withdraw his amendment.
   The Mitchell maneuver also sidelined an amendment by his
fellow Democratic Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, which would
have cut the Social Security payroll tax on middle- and
lower-income taxpayers. Senator Mitchell, understand, is in
politics to raise taxes, not cut them.
   This time, however, he apparently had Republican allies.
Bob Dole, the GOP Minority Leader, made it clear he didn't
want a vote on either amendment. The Treasury Department
lobbyists were also all over the Senate cloakroom Saturday,
telling Senators that Kasten-Mack would weaken chances for a
budget-summit agreement; they even pressed the old argument
that a capital-gains cut would lose revenue.
   The Treasury lobbying raises the question whether the
department basically supports the capital-gains cut that
George Bush backed during the Presidential campaign. Senator
Mitchell, it seems, has the President stuck to the summit tar
baby.
   No doubt it would be tidier if such a cut entered the
economy by a route other than a bill to increase the debt
limit. But we offer last weekend's incident as part of our
continuing coverage of Senator Mitchell's insistence on
playing the troll under the public-policy bridge and blocking
all action on capital gains.
   The Majority Leader's it-shall-not-pass stance leaves us
here: Unemployment is rising, Saddam Hussein has upset oil
markets, the stock market has a bad case of the jitters, the
real-estate market is in the tank, bankers are fearful of
making loans, the S&amp;L debacle is engulfing Washington. But
the idea of cutting the tax rate on capital gains is an
anathema on which the Senate isn't even allowed to vote.
