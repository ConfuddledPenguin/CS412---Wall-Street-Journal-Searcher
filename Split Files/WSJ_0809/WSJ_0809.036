   ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Few perceptions of strategic value
have changed as quickly as those regarding Turkey.
   The crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has turned a new
light on a country where only recently Turkish commentators
were complaining that with the end of the Cold War, Turkey --
a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- was
slipping off the world's strategic map. Now it is coming into
its own under the leadership of President Turgut Ozal, who
yesterday was termed "a staunch friend of the United States"
by President Bush.

   The change in perception isn't just in Washington. Europe
also is applauding Turkey's firm stand on the United Nations
embargo of Iraq. Even formerly patronizing Middle East powers
such as Iran, and Iraq itself, have sent envoys as
petitioners to Ankara, the nation's capital.
   Such treatment contrasts with the European Community's
polite refusal in December to deal with Ankara's application
to join the EC, condemnations of Turkey's human-rights
record, a pro-Armenian bill before the U.S. Congress this
year, and what Turkey had seen as a tilt toward Greece by the
U.S. and Europe.
   It's unlikely that changes in these stances will be the
only price the West has to pay for Turkey's support in the
Kuwait crisis. Sources in Washington, who asked to remain
anonymous, told the Associated Press that Turkey is seeking
compensation of as much as $2 billion in exchange for
shutting down the Iraqi oil pipeline that crosses its
territory. U.S. officials said the question of compensation
probably will come up in talks with Secretary of State James
Baker, who is to meet with Turkish leaders today.
   President Ozal himself estimated that the U.N. sanctions
will cost Turkey $2 billion a year. Iraq was Turkey's second
biggest trading partner last year, with $1.1 billion of trade
and more than $250 million in transit fees for Iraq's
trans-Turkey oil pipelines, now blocked by Ankara.
   But Turkish public opinion is largely behind the U.N.
sanctions. "We have complaints, but we have to respect the
decision of the government," said Osman Gelikoglu, head of
the International Transport Association that represents
Turkey's 300,000-truck transport industry, a third of which
works on Iraqi routes.
   "It was one of those times we had to choose and say which
values we really believed in," said an Istanbul tour
operator. "This is a chance to prove we want to belong to
Europe."
   But Turks fear the subject of military intervention,
especially a possible U.S. request to use American bases in
Turkey against Iraq. Fourteen U.S. F-111 attack bombers are
already on "routine training" at the NATO base at Incirlik,
500 miles from the Iraqi border.
   "We have said that we will implement the U.N. decision.
There should be no further burden" on Turkey, said Mr. Ozal,
who hasn't ruled out use of the bases.
   A senior government official, also anonymous, told the
Associated Press that Turkey is unlikely to join a
multinational force in Saudi Arabia. But the official said he
doesn't expect Turkey to "say yes or no right away" to any
American request for use of the NATO base for any Gulf
intervention.
   Any involvement of Turkey's 800,000 troops is likely to
arouse bipartisan protest unless the troops are part of a
U.N. effort, diplomats say. Opposition parties have called
the Turkish parliament out of recess to discuss the crisis
Sunday.
   "Whatever any other country does, we will do," said
right-wing opposition leader Suleyman Demirel. "But nobody
can say to us, `Come on, you Turkish lions,' and send us to
the Gulf."
   Deniz Baykal, deputy leader of the main Social Democrat
opposition, also warned: "We don't see ourselves as the
gendarme of the region, and nobody else should do so."
   Commentators have been quick to point out that many
Turkish cities are within range of Iraqi chemical weapons.
Some also said any number of U.S. guarantees or offers of
compensation aren't enough to justify violating the
traditional regional neutrality of Turkey.
   "Turkey went into the hell of the Korean War to get
accepted in NATO. Now we are risking the curse of the Gulf in
order to get into Europe and look good to America," wrote
Mumtaz Soysal in Milliyet, a liberal newspaper. "One of our
most common proverbs says, `Do not get mixed up in Arabs'
business.' Saddam's dictatorship doesn't concern the Turkish
people one jot."
