   TROY, Mich. -- Volkswagen, struggling to boost its U.S.
sales, is offering consumers something they can't get from
any other car maker: their money back if they aren't
satisfied.
   The offer, which starts tomorrow, applies only to the
Volkswagen Passat, a midsized sedan that the German auto
maker introduced earlier this year. Under the program, Passat
buyers have three months or 3,000 miles to decide whether the
car meets their expectations. If they don't like the Passat,
Volkswagen will refund all of their money, virtually no
questions asked.

   A few auto makers have experimented with satisfaction
guarantees in the past, but they have required buyers to
apply the refunded money toward the purchase of another
model. General Motors Corp.'s Oldsmobile division, for
example, gives unhappy buyers credit for the full price of
their Olds. But the credit is good only toward the purchase
of a different Olds model.
   To be sure, VW is a small player in the U.S. with only
1.4% of the U.S. car market. Still, competitors will almost
certainly watch the German auto maker's move closely to see
if consumers accept it as an alternative to increasingly
confusing and costly cash rebate discounts.
   Officials with the U.S. arm of Volkswagen AG simply want
the move to jump-start sales of the Passat. "Our goal is to
say to the public, `At least consider us,'" said William J.
Young, Volkswagen of America Inc.'s vice president in charge
of U.S. VW operations.
   Volkswagen officials had high hopes for the Passat when
they brought it out in February. The car is the biggest model
VW has sold in the U.S., and the company predicted it would
steal sales from the highly popular Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus
and Honda Accord sedans. The 1990 Passat, at $14,770 to
$19,200, is priced slightly higher than those models. The
Accord, for instance, ranges from $13,095 to $17,345.
   VW officials projected they would ultimately sell 3,000 of
the cars a month, but sales have fallen far short of that
goal. Through July, Volkswagen has sold just 8,558 Passats --
an average of 1,426 a month. That's a big reason why VW's
U.S. sales -- 83,637 vehicles through July -- look to fall
well short of the internal goal of 200,000 vehicles for the
year.
   "We have to break new ground even if we're too small to
really lead the industry in a different direction," says
Robert La Torre, owner of LaTorre Volkswagen in Reseda,
Calif. "With our sales the way they've been, we need to stand
out with consumers."
   The money-back offer certainly is different. It's "one of
the most aggressive marketing tactics ever seen from an auto
manufacturer," says Christopher Cedergren, an analyst with
J.D. Power &amp; Associates Inc., an Agoura Hills, Calif.,
research and consulting firm. "One of Volkswagen's
fundamental problems is getting people to drive its cars. The
Passat is going up against the Accord and Camry, which have
the image of walking on water."
   VW's failure to keep pace as Japan's largest auto makers
pushed into the family sedan market is a major reason why the
auto maker's U.S. market share has tumbled so far since 1970.
That year, VW's share of the U.S. market peaked at 7% -- more
than all other importers combined.
   VW has tried to be more aggressive since Mr. Young took
over in February 1989. At the start of the 1990 model year,
VW cut prices on its models in hopes of weaning consumers
from rebates.
   But the lower-price, no-rebate strategy produced only a
0.6% increase in sales through July this year. Mr. Young, in
a news conference at VW's headquarters here, reiterated the
company's resolve to stay away from rebate offers. VW prices
will rise from 1.5% to 2.3% this fall.
   If Oldsmobile's experience is any guide, it's not a cinch
that consumers will rush in because of the offer.
   Oldsmobile has offered a guaranteed trade-in allowance on
all its vehicles since the start of the 1990 model year last
fall. Olds says it attracted about 12% more first-time buyers
of its cars because of the offer. But Oldsmobile's total
sales for the model year through July are off 20.3% from last
year's dismal sales.
   One reason more auto makers haven't offered money-back
guarantees is uncertainty over how many vehicles will be
returned, and the complex logistics of re-selling the
returned vehicles.
   But Volkswagen officials said a survey of Passat owners
showing 97% satisfaction emboldened them to try the tactic.
Mr. Young said the plan came together over the past two
weeks. Oldsmobile says fewer than 1% of the cars sold under
its program were returned.
   About the only Passats excluded from the guarantee are
fleet or rental cars, as well as those abused or damaged.
   "We're trying to avoid a hostile point of exchange with
the customers," said William A. Gelgota Jr., director of
marketing for VW in the U.S. "We're not going to tie people
up with a lot of questions."
   Volkswagen plans to let employees drive the returned cars
and sell some of them as used vehicles through dealers. The
offer will run until Oct. 31. But VW officials said they may
extend the guarantee if it works.

   VOLKSWAGEN AG's U.S. sales and marketing arm is offering
buyers of the Volkswagen Passat a full, money-back guarantee
for 30 days or 3,000 miles after the purchase of the car.
Yesterday's editions stated a longer period of time could
elapse under the offer.
