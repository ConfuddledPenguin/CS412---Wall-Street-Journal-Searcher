   JOHNSTOWN, Pa. -- Penn Traffic Co. said its directors
voted unanimously to exempt the corporation from
Pennsylvania's recently enacted "anti-takeover" act.
   "We have decided that the Pennsylvania Business
Corporation Law as in effect prior to the enactment of the
anti-takeover amendments is more favorable to our
shareholders," said Gary D. Hirsch, chairman of Penn Traffic,
a retailer.
