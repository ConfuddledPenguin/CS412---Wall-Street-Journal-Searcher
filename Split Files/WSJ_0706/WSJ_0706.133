   A NEW ENERGY TAX is being pushed by the Bush
administration as a way to help cut the budget deficit. The
levy would bring in an estimated $20 billion a year, more

including coal and petroleum, and would add five or six cents
a gallon to the price of gasoline.

   Price Waterhouse could face contempt penalties if it
violates securities laws, under a permanent injunction sought
by the SEC. The agency claims the accounting firm is likely
