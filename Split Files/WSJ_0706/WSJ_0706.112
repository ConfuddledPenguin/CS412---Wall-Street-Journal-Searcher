   Millipore Corp. said sales from its continuing lines of
business grew 12% in the second quarter compared with the
year-ago period, while sales in the first half grew 11% from
a year earlier.
   Millipore said the growth rates exclude results from its
process water division, which was sold in November.

   Including results from the process water division,
Millipore said, sales growth was 4% over the year-ago quarter
and 3% over the year-earlier six months. Had currency
exchange rates remained constant in 1989 and 1990, Millipore
said, its growth rate, excluding results for the sold
division, would have been 10% for both the quarter and first
half.
   For the 1989 second quarter, Millipore had net income of
$13.5 million, or 48 cents a share, on sales of $167 million.
For the first half, Millipore had net income of $25.9
million, or 93 cents a share, on sales of $327.8 million.
   Millipore, a Bedford, Mass., analytical and purification
products concern, will release its second quarter results
later this month.
