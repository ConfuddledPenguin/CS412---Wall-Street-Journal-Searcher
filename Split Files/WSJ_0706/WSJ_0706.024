   GENEVA -- Times are changing for the tradition-steeped
world of this city's private bankers.
   With Switzerland's legendary banking secrecy law under
attack, Geneva's elite money men are increasingly stressing
performance and professionalism as they seek to diversify
their client base and take business from the major global
players in the institutional fund management business.

   At the same time, the bankers are faced with more
demanding private "high net-worth" clients and competition
from other tight-lipped banking centers such as Luxembourg
and Austria, and even upstarts like Hungary and Sri Lanka.
   The Swiss government's lifting in the past two years of
banking secrecy while investigating funds allegedly belonging
to deposed dictators Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines,
Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, and Jean-Claude Duvalier of
Haiti, has led outsiders to question just how air-tight a
Swiss bank account is.
   Now, the private bankers increasingly recognize that the
days of easily winning new clients are over. "We don't think
as far as our long-term strategy goes, Swiss banking secrecy
will and should play a major role in attracting clients,"
says Thierry Lombard, a managing partner at Lombard Odier &amp;
Cie., which began to take deposits 192 years ago.
   The Geneva houses deny that the highly publicized
investigations have any negative implications for their
average customer, but they do know they must broaden their
client base to continue to thrive.
   "The typical, honest client who has a little reserve in
Switzerland does not have anything to fear for the time
being," says Benedict Hentsch, managing partner of Hentsch &amp;
Cie., Geneva's oldest private bank, founded in 1796.
"Nevertheless, I would think we should work under the
assumption that the pressure will be mounting against banking
secrecy and that we have to become even better managers to
compensate for the disappearance of it."
   Lombard Odier &amp; Cie., and Hentsch &amp; Cie. are two of the
six banks that make up the Groupement des Banquiers prives
genevois. The Geneva houses differ from most other Swiss
financial institutions in that they don't make loans and
their partners carry the unlimited liability for any deposits
at the bank. They have until recently engaged mainly in
protecting the funds of wealthy foreigners.
   Whether the private banks can successfully diversify into
the high profile world of institutional investment is far
from certain. Unlike some of their giant competitors in the
U.S., the U.K. and some of the Swiss commercial banks, most
Geneva private bankers prefer the soft sell.
   Even at home, hand-sized brass plaques with a few initials
are all that identify a private banks' headquarters. They
leave the more aggressive foreign houses to dominate Geneva's
sprawling lake front with their flashy modern buildings and
giant corporate logos.
   Still, most members of the Groupement des Banquiers prives
genevois say business has been excellent, but since they're
closely held, no financial data are made public. Outside
analysts estimate that the six banks have some 85 billion
Swiss francs ($60 billion) under management, about double the
total 10 years ago despite significant capital repatriation
from clients in France and Italy as the economic and taxation
climate in those countries improved.
   Lombard Odier &amp; Cie., Hentsch &amp; Cie., and Pictet &amp; Cie. in
particular have been steadily expanding in the past decade,
largely to win institutional clients.
   Pictet has set up shop in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Montreal and
last month in Luxembourg. Lombard Odier has opened offices in
the Netherlands and Canada, expanded in the U.K, and become
the first European bank to obtain a seat on the New York
Stock Exchange. Hentsch has bought or taken important stakes
in banks in Tokyo, Milan and Nassau.
   And nearly all the members of Geneva's Groupement have
started up or expanded offices in Zurich, mainly to be in the
running for Switzerland's potentially lucrative pension fund
business. A recent study sponsored by Salomon Brothers
estimated that Swiss pension fund assets totalled 225 billion
francs in 1989, and should rise to 360 billion francs by 1995
as pooled investments become more common.
   Not all banks are going for institutional clients, though.
For example, Bordier &amp; Cie., one of the smallest in the
Groupement, plans to keep its focus on serving rich
individuals rather than starting up the expensive marketing,
research and reporting departments needed to win
institutional accounts.
