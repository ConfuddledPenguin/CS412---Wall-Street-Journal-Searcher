   DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc., which filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy code last month,
said it agreed to resume paying its former parent company,
Greyhound Dial Corp., for rentals and leases on 15 major bus
terminals, a New York City maintenance facility and about
2,000 buses.
   Phoenix, Ariz.-based Greyhound Dial officials estimated
the payments at about $3.8 million a month.

   J. Michael Doyle, Greyhound Lines senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said the agreement would permit
Greyhound Lines to develop its reorganization plan without
having to spend time deciding whether to assume or reject
hundreds of leases held by Greyhound Dial, which retains a
22.5% stake in the closely held bus company.
   Greyhound Lines and five other units of GLI Holding Co.
filed for bankruptcy law protection last month in
Brownsville, Texas, following a financially devastating
strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Although the agreement was filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Brownsville, federal Judge Richard S. Schmidt was
not asked to approve it, although he has permitted Greyhound
Lines to use current revenue to meet operating expenses.
