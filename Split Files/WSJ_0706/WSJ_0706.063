   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. cut ratings on the
debt of three Finnish banks, reflecting an increasingly
deregulated and competitive operating environment.
   The three banks "have some common problems," each with its
own particular difficulties, "but it all comes out of the
deregulated and competitive market," said Virginia L. Manzer,
an analyst at S&amp;P.

Kansallis-Osake-Pankki to double-A-minus from double-A. The
bank's subordinated debt falls to single-A-plus from

affected.
   S&amp;P cut Union Bank of Finland Ltd.'s $1.6 billion of
senior unsecured debt to double-A-minus from double-A. And
Postipankki Ltd.'s $415 million of senior unsecured
