   WASHINGTON -- Federal criminal investigators have
identified the biggest fish so far in their inquiry into a
defense-industry ring that illicitly obtained and swapped
Pentagon planning secrets -- and he is likely to get away.
   Malcolm R. Currie, the high-profile chairman of Hughes
Aircraft Co. -- a General Motors Corp. subsidiary and the
nation's fifth-largest defense contractor -- received some of
the same classified information that landed lower-level
industry officials in jail for ferreting it out of the
Defense Department, federal court records show.

   Mr. Currie may have done more than just read excerpts from
internal Pentagon papers passed along to him by underlings.
According to testimony by several former Hughes employees and
documents filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., Mr.
Currie approved a system to funnel hundreds of pages of
Pentagon documents into Hughes while circumventing the
company's normal security procedures. The allegations were
made in open court last month but haven't been reported until
now.
   Yet the criminal investigation of Mr. Currie, which has
been under way for several months, according to several
law-enforcement officials, seems unlikely to lead to an
indictment. Mr. Currie currently isn't a target of the grand
jury investigating the scandal. But investigators are
contemplating filing some sort of civil action against
several companies and individuals, including Mr. Currie.
   Prosecutors may be frustrated in pursuing a criminal case
against Mr. Currie because of timing. The five-year statute
of limitations covering the company's document-gathering
activities expired three months ago. Also, the Justice
Department complicated matters in March, when -- believing it
had wrapped up its case against Hughes by getting a guilty
plea and $3.6 million in penalties from the company -- it
said it wouldn't seek criminal charges against senior
management. The internal Hughes memoranda most damaging to
Mr. Currie didn't surface until later, investigators say.
Finally, the investigation has been slowed by the refusal of
seven former and current Hughes officials to cooperate unless
immunized from prosecution.
   Michael Costello, the lead Pentagon investigator on the
documents case, declines to discuss the allegations against
Mr. Currie. But speaking generally about top defense-industry
executives, he says, "The ones that got away, got away by the
skin of their teeth."
   Mr. Currie, through a Hughes spokesman, declined to be
interviewed for this article. General Motors also declined to
comment.
   One of the most sweeping white-collar inquiries in years,
involving several major defense contractors and billions of
dollars in weapons contracts, the government's data-swapping
case thus far has netted only lower-level figures. Six
marketing managers from five companies have been found guilty
of improperly distributing sensitive Pentagon planning
reports.
   By obtaining bootlegged copies of internal Pentagon
spending plans, Hughes and other contractors were able to
more effectively target their marketing and research efforts,
according to investigators. That gave the contractors an edge
over less-knowledgeable competitors, and an advantage in
negotiations with the Pentagon.
   The six convicted managers maintained that their
activities had been sanctioned by top officials at their
companies. Yet at least in public the managers gave little
specific evidence of that approval. Memos sent to Mr. Currie
offer the first solid corroboration that the information
gleaned from the Pentagon documents actually found its way to
the highest levels of defense corporations.
   For instance, a 13-page analysis of advanced
attack-weapons programs prepared by a Hughes employee in
March 1983 and sent directly to Mr. Currie began by saying,
"What I have reviewed are the following data: . . . POM
84-May 1982." POMs, or Program Objective Memoranda, are
documents intended only for a few dozen senior Defense
Department officials; Mr. Currie, a former chief of Pentagon
research, had served at a level at which such documents were
customarily circulated. Their cover sheets carry the notice:
"Disclosure restricted."
   "I made sure that Mal Currie knew what I was doing,"
former Hughes budget analyst Frank Caso, who prepared that
13-page analysis, testified at his federal court trial in
Alexandria last month. "He thoroughly supported it, endorsed
it. In his very nice charming way, he put his arm around me
and said, `I've known you a long time, Frank. I'm looking
forward to working with you a long time.'" Mr. Caso was
convicted of trafficking in classified government documents
and is awaiting sentencing.
   A Hughes spokesman said that Mr. Currie "did not have any
knowledge of the conduct for which Mr. Caso was convicted."
Because Mr. Caso is still to be sentenced, the spokesman
said, it would be inappropriate to say anything else about
the matter.
   The revelations in the Caso trial threaten Mr. Currie's
reputation as one of the defense establishment's leading
lights. When he took over as chairman of Hughes, he seemed
the perfect choice to right a large and troubled
organization. He brought with him a Ph.D. in engineering,
experience in Washington, and a candid style seldom seen
among top defense-industry executives. His predecessor had
left under the cloud of an unrelated criminal investigation.
   Comfortable in the spotlight, the dapper, silver-haired
Mr. Currie became an Iacocca-like spokesman for Hughes in the
company's first national ad campaign. In a two-page spread in
the June 4 issue of Time magazine, Mr. Currie discoursed on
the "perfect partnership" between General Motors's
manufacturing experience and Hughes's technical expertise.
   Out of the public eye, Mr. Currie had problems -- though
they were unrecognized at the time. In 1977 he had become
chief of Hughes's missile division, which, among other
things, builds armaments for jet fighters and anti-tank
weapons. Between then and the spring of 1983, when he moved
on to a higher post at Hughes headquarters, he received at
least four memos from Mr. Caso or his associates that
referred by name to classified Pentagon documents that
contractors weren't supposed to see. Among the documents
cited in the memos are some that Mr. Caso was convicted for
handling.
   One memo about the outlook for defense spending, for
example, referred in its first paragraph to the Pentagon's
"Consolidated Guidance," a blueprint for long-term spending.
Such documents typically carry the warning "Not Releasable to
Contractors-Consultants."
   Other top company officials received Hughes memos stamped
"Marketing Sensitive" that quoted from restricted Pentagon
documents. These executives include D. Kenneth Richardson,
the current president of Hughes, and Ted Wong, now the head
of the missile group. Mr. Wong declined to comment. His
attorney said, "I don't know what he knew." Mr. Richardson is
traveling in Europe and couldn't be reached for comment. A
Hughes spokesman said he didn't believe Mr. Richardson had an
attorney. The government has indicated that based on current
evidence, it doesn't intend to seek criminal charges against
either man.
   Mr. Currie was interviewed once by Defense Department
investigators earlier this year, after the Hughes plea
agreement was filed, law-enforcement officials say. They
didn't put him under oath; officials decline to discuss why.
Mr. Currie said then that he wasn't aware of any
improprieties at Hughes.
   On March 9, when Hughes pleaded guilty in the documents
case, Mr. Currie issued a letter to company employees that
stated: "The acquisition and possession of such documents was
wrong and cannot be justified. . . .We have all learned from
this incident, and we should all renew our personal
commitment to the standards of business conduct and integrity
we have set for ourselves."
   Mr. Caso's lawyers wanted Mr. Currie to testify at last
month's trial, but Mr. Currie's attorney refused to accept a
subpoena on behalf of his client. By the time a new subpoena
was issued, Mr. Currie had left on a previously scheduled
trip to Brazil. "He would have been an essential witness,"
says Marcus Topel, an attorney for Mr. Caso. Seven other
current and former Hughes officials declined to testify,
invoking a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Prosecutors already have demonstrated that
document-swapping became almost commonplace among defense
contractors in the early 1980s. Employees of roughly a dozen
contractors obtained the papers and traded them as routinely
as business cards. Some of the documents that Mr. Caso
illicitly brought into Hughes bore distinctive markings
showing they came from Boeing Co. Richard Lee Fowler, a
former Boeing analyst described by prosecutors as the kingpin
of the information-gathering ring, and the subject of a
page-one article in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 15, is in
jail for his role in the scheme.
   The ring of document-swappers, which prosecutors dubbed
"the Clique," went to great lengths to hide its tracks.
According to testimony at Mr. Caso's trial, officials at one
company went so far as to install wheels under the giant
cabinets in which they stored their bootlegged documents.
Whenever Pentagon security inspectors showed up, the
officials rolled the cabinets to the roof of their office
building.
   At Hughes, the government alleged that Mr. Caso and some
of his cohorts logged in unauthorized documents under phony
titles, used special courier passes to avoid inspection by
security guards, and slipped some of the material into
personal desk drawers not subject to Defense Department
searches.
   There is no suggestion that Mr. Currie participated
directly in the Clique by obtaining documents from Pentagon
officials or by making clandestine trades with other
contractors.
   Yet company employees testified that he was aware that
Pentagon secrets were being brought into the company. The
employees said they took his response to mean at least tacit
approval. "The man {Mr. Currie} was a former assistant
secretary of defense. If he didn't know the rules . . . who
was I to know?" Sharyn Pinkstaff, Mr. Caso's former
assistant, testified. Ms. Pinkstaff, who has been granted
immunity from prosecution and who appeared at the trial as a
government witness, still works for Hughes. She declined to
be interviewed.
   She also testified that she used to deliver some of the
unauthorized documents themselves -- not just memos about
them -- to high-ranking Hughes executives, including Mr.
Currie.
   And she went on to make more serious allegations about the
chairman. All defense companies with security clearances are
required to maintain a system to safeguard, track and certify
the disposal of the classified information they receive.
Pentagon agents routinely inspect contractors' compliance
with the regulations for those security systems. Ms.
Pinkstaff testified that after Mr. Caso received a written
reprimand from Hughes security personnel in 1978 for a sloppy
accounting of the classified documents in his possession, he
told her he personally appealed to Mr. Currie to authorize a
new document-identification system that would avoid such
hassles. Both Ms. Pinkstaff and Mr. Caso said from the
witness stand that Mr. Currie did just that.
   Under this new system, government exhibits in the Caso
trial indicate, Mr. Caso could bring any papers he wished
into the Hughes classified document network without company
security officers scrutinizing their contents. Keeping the
illicitly obtained documents in the security system --
sometimes under obscure labels -- could give them the
appearance of legitimacy and make it easier to move them
around within the company. Material brought in by other
Hughes employees was examined more closely, investigators
say. Eventually the security requirements for Mr. Caso were
loosened even more, allowing him to log in documents merely
by making a phone call to a Hughes clerk.
   Jim Calder, who was security chief at the missile division
in the late 1970s, made a note to his file after a meeting
with Mr. Caso and Mr. Caso's boss, Eugene Babb, to discuss
the new arrangement.
   In the note, filed in federal court, Mr. Calder wrote:
"Caso and Babb described their meeting with M.R. Currie . . .
in which Currie was made aware of both the current and
previous system that Caso has maintained for sensitive
information gathering. Both stated that Currie supports the
continuation of information gathering. Allegedly, Currie told
Caso to be extremely careful in his involvement with this
matter." Mr. Babb, who has retired from Hughes, declines
comment. So do Mr. Calder and his attorneys.
   In an earlier memo to his files, Mr. Calder emphasized the
importance Hughes placed on Mr. Caso's information-gathering.
"Caso may not be the only person in the company doing what he
considers to be important for our business," the memo said,
"but he is the only one I know of with an identifiable
charter."
   In the mid-1980s, Pentagon investigators had begun to
stumble across classified documents in odd places. Poking
around in contractors' files, they soon realized the extent
to which the government had lost control of its secrets.
Following a trail of copied documents, they discovered the
Clique.
   A couple of years later, as the grand jury inquiry swung
into full gear, Hughes launched its own internal
investigation. At least six officials were forced out of the
company, law-enforcement officials say. Hughes, eager to
continue doing business with the government, eventually
turned over to the Justice Department a huge volume of
internal documents, including the memos to Mr. Currie that
laid out the Pentagon secrets.
   But investigators received Mr. Calder's memos from his
attorneys only about three months ago. It is those memos that
are most damaging to Mr. Currie.
   Yet investigators think the people behind the Clique
probably will remain beyond their reach. "There's no doubt in
our mind that senior people in these corporations were
involved," Mr. Costello says. "They had knowledge of the
activities and shared in the wealth of the information. It
goes way up the corporate chain."
