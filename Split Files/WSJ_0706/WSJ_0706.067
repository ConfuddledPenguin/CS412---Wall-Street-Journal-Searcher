   "There were some economic plans proposed back in 1982 that
caused a furor something like we're hearing now. And the
president, in my view, did what was right."
   -- George Bush, June 29, 1990

   Haven't I seen this picture before? Wasn't it "Friday the
13th"? Of all of George Bush's answers at the worst press
conference of his presidency last Friday, the most depressing
was his reference to 1982. He meant the notorious "TEFRA" tax
act of that summer, the lowest moment of the Reagan
presidency until Iran-Contra. Does Mr. Bush really want to do
a summer sequel?
   The question matters, because for all the uproar over the
demise of the no-new-tax pledge, the budget summit isn't over
yet. What matters is the deal George Bush signs. But if TEFRA
is his historical guide, we should all start calculating our
lower take-home pay. That history is worth rehearsing lest it
be repeated.
   The $100 billion TEFRA tax hike was the Washington
community's first attempt to repeal Reaganomics. Mr. Reagan
signed onto it in the middle of recession (and amid much
Beltway gloating), but he overcame it later for two reasons.
First, TEFRA repealed only part of the much larger 1981
Reagan tax cut; when the tax cut's fiscal stimulus finally
hit in 1983, the economy boomed. Second, voters could accept
a modest U-turn from Ronald Reagan because his public
identity as a tax-cutter was already so strong. Mr. Bush has
neither Reagan card in reserve.
   Just how bad was TEFRA in 1982? Let us count the ways.
Though it was peddled as a deficit-reducer, the budget
deficit still soared -- to 6% of the economy in 1983.
Congress spent as ever. The $3 in promised spending cuts for
every $1 of tax increases never materialized.
   TEFRA also proved irrelevant to its other avowed purpose,
that of inducing the Federal Reserve to reduce interest
rates. In his exhaustive 1987 book on the Fed, journalist
(and no friend of Reaganomics) William Greider wrote that
"there was no real connection" between the tax deal and the
Fed's decision to ease. "The Fed had decided to ease interest
rates a full month before final passage of the tax bill was a
certainty," he wrote. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker had other
reasons to act: Trouble in Mexico and at Penn Square Bank
threatened the banking system, and the economy was already in
deep recession.
   As for politics, Republicans lost 26 House seats that
November. TEFRA didn't help. Larry Kudlow, the Bear Stearns
economist who worked at the White House at the time, recalls
simply that, "TEFRA was a disaster."
   Mr. Bush's aides now insist they've learned since then.
But there are signs that maybe they haven't learned enough --
Mr. Bush's Friday comments for one. Nicholas Brady, the
Treasury secretary, supported TEFRA while in the Senate in
1982 and has said privately that a budget deal is critical to
get the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. Yet
this Fed, as much as Paul Volcker's, has to its great credit
followed its own economic logic.
   "What worries me," says one GOP official with long
experience in Washington, "is that this has become a monetary
fishing expedition." TEFRA aside, the last administration to
try to trade fiscal austerity for monetary ease in this way
left office in 1981.
   Then there's Richard Darman, the crafty budget director
who was also present at TEFRA's creation. Mr. Darman is smart
enough to know the history, but he also badly wants a budget
deal so he can claim a successful tenure at OMB. Senior
officials worry that in the end Mr. Darman will give up any
serious reforms of the budget process if he can get major
cuts in entitlements (Medicare). Already, White House aides
say the line-item veto is off the table. At least the
capital-gains tax cut is still living, but other new taxes
will be offered to Democrats in exchange.
   George Bush has run a tactical presidency, tacking as the
political pressures shift. But even tacticians have their
moments of definition, and this is one. If he gets the con-
cessions he wants from Democrats, his tax reversal may be
forgiven. But Democrats, having won repeal of the tax pledge
at no cost to them, will not now cooperate easily. Their
demands will escalate to include the symbolic repeal of
Reaganomics, through an increase in the top marginal tax
rate.
   Painted into his tactical corner, Mr. Bush will have only
two options if Democrats don't budge. He can accept a phony
TEFRA-like deal that will be heralded by his enemies as
"statesmanship" but will in fact signal a great defeat. He
will gain Beltway applause without getting control over the
budget.
   Or he could reject a bad deal, and explain to voters that
he put everything on the table and still got no help from a
do-nothing Congress. He could blame Democrats for causing the
trauma of Gramm-Rudman's automatic budget cuts. Blood would
flow, but the betting here is that with his bully pulpit and
residual popularity, Mr. Bush would prevail. Of course, this
would require a political courage and public candor rarely
seen so far in the Bush White House.
   In changing his mind about lip-reading, Mr. Bush asks us
to remember Abraham Lincoln. But if Mr. Bush merely repeats
the debacle of 1982, a different presidential analogy will be
on voters' lips. That president grew up in Georgia, not
Illinois.
