   BOSTON -- You'd figure that the second-best mutual fund
manager in America could at least boast of being the best
stock picker on his block.
   Not G. Kenneth Heebner. For the past decade, Mr. Heebner
has been toiling down the street from the most successful
mutual fund manager in history, Fidelity Investments' Peter
Lynch, whose celebrity -- and long shadow -- edged well
beyond the Who's Who of finance.

   Now Mr. Lynch is gone, having retired recently at the age
of 46 and leaving Mr. Heebner, a private, 49-year-old
bachelor, in the unlikely role of the nation's pre-eminent
stock market guru.
   "All the attention goes to whoever's No. 1, and that was
always Peter, making it easy for Nos. 2, 3 and 4 to just sit
back and go about their business," says Mr. Heebner from the
spanking new offices of Capital Growth Management Inc., an
investment-fund company he operates in a freshly minted
limited partnership with New England Mutual Life Insurance
Co. "I've always felt being No. 1 is a little dangerous.
People expect too much from you."
   But Mr. Heebner seems to be rising to the task. In the
quarter just ended, Mr. Heebner's various funds have done
well. New England Growth Fund, his largest with $643 million
in assets, returned 15.5% for the second quarter. The fund's
10-year return is 598.95%. Meanwhile, Capital Growth
Management's Capital Development Fund (which is closed to new
investors) posted a robust 17.3% return for the second
quarter, making it one of the top 25 funds for the quarter.
   Over 10 years, Mr. Heebner has guided the Capital
Development Fund to a 703.93% return. Now that Mr. Lynch has
retired -- along with his 1,123.85% 10-year return for
Magellan through May 31 -- Mr. Heebner's 10-year record is
the best of any active fund manager.
   Yet Mr. Heebner has always seemed like a star pitcher on a
middling team. Because his funds are largely sold as what he
himself calls "secondary products" by insurance agents, Mr.
Heebner's performance has never drawn the flood of assets
that his record would seem likely to command. Unlike
Fidelity, whose marketing punch helped turn Mr. Lynch's
skills into more than one million accounts and $14 billion in
assets, New England Mutual has slowly gathered just over $2
billion in assets for Mr. Heebner's various funds.
   So why does Mr. Heebner stay? The recent proliferation of
mutual funds has spawned fierce competition to hire top fund
managers. Mr. Heebner could just about name his price.
   Which, in large measure, is why New England Mutual agreed
last fall to transfer those $2.2 billion in assets handled by
its star money manager into a new operation called Capital
Growth Management. Mr. Heebner and Robert Kemp, the former
president and chief executive officer of Loomis, Sayles &amp;
Co., New England Mutual's investment subsidiary under which
all of Mr. Heebner's funds had been housed, were granted 25%
of Capital Growth Management's equity. They have an option to
gradually obtain a majority position through reinvestment of
earnings over the next five years.
   The incentive of ownership, says Mr. Heebner, "gives a
little extra oomph" to his daily rigors. With his funds at
peak performance and a controlling ownership share in the
offing, Mr. Heebner says he has "never felt more energized."
   Of course, the key to Mr. Heebner's five-year plan is
sustaining his performance. His overall strategy has remained
unchanged since last spring: The softening economy would
weaken many large industries -- such as automobiles, housing
and defense contractors -- but would highlight specialized
"niche" companies that can continue to grow despite a
sluggish economy.
   The stocks he's excited about represent a typical Heebner
mix: a small basket of stocks -- at this point representing
just 21 picks -- including few large companies, some small
growth stocks, and what Mr. Heebner called "a few strange
picks."
   Leading the roster is Philip Morris Cos., in which Mr.
Heebner has invested nearly 8% of his Capital Development
Fund's portfolio. "I understand tobacco's not good for you,
but it sells," says Mr. Heebner, who expects Philip Morris's
earnings to grow as it takes away market share from
debt-strapped RJR Nabisco Inc. Mr. Heebner also likes Eli
Lilly &amp; Co., the pharmaceutical manufacturer, which he said
should continue to see robust sales from an anti-depressant
drug.
   Among smaller, growth stocks, Mr. Heebner says one of his
"strange picks" is Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., a
retailer of clothes for young men, which he calls "the
Wal-Mart stores of teenage fashion." Earnings growth, he
notes, is better than 30% a year. Mr. Heebner also has
invested in Harley-Davidson Inc., the motorcycle maker, which
he says has revamped both its management and manufacturing in
the past few years and now is trouncing Japanese motorcyle
makers in the export market.
   The analytic thread running through all these picks is
earnings. Mr. Heebner is strictly an earnings man -- has been
since the mid-'70s. "If you're right on the earnings -- which
of course is a feat, based on really understanding the
company -- then stock price will eventually follow."
   It is a dogma Mr. Heebner has returned to in the past
year, after a disastrous lapse. The market's crash in the
fall of 1987 prompted Mr. Heebner, like so many other money
managers, to rethink basic assumptions about market behavior.
Mr. Heebner, a trained economist, assumed interest rates
would rise, causing a credit crunch and sinking both the
economy and the stock market. He pulled back sharply in 1988,
keeping close to 50% of his funds in cash.
   "My underlying assumptions were right -- rates rose and
credit got tight -- but the market kept rising," he says,
shrugging. "We had an abysmal year." Three of his five funds
had negative returns. New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund,
a variable annuity sold only by New England Mutual agents as
part of a whole-life insurance policy, fell 8.9%, while the
market rose 16.6%.
   The drought stretched into the first quarter of 1989, when
Loomis, Sayles Capital Development Fund -- now called the
Capital Growth Management Capital Development Fund -- showed
a paltry gain of 0.76%, placing it nearly dead last among the
258 growth funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
   Mr. Heebner notes that despite his fears about interest
rates, corporate earnings rose almost 40% in 1988, well
outrunning a modest decline in stocks' price/earnings ratios.
Again, he concedes, earnings proved to win out -- and, by
spring of 1989, Mr. Heebner had returned to his roots. "I
started again to do what I love to do, analyze companies and
to aggressively invest." The improvements were immediate.
Even after a bad start last year, the Zenith fund finished
the year with a gain of 30.76%, compared with 31.7% in the
S&amp;P 500 index.
   So these days, a revitalized Mr. Heebner strolls each
morning, analyst reports in hand, from his one-bedroom Beacon
Hill apartment to Capital Growth's offices. Beyond the
45-foot sloop he sails on summer weekends, there are few
distractions from the steady beat of analyzing, six days a
week, a flurry of quarterly earnings reports and company
fortunes.
   "It's what I love to do -- if I could, I would do nothing
else," says Mr. Heebner. He says he is happy handling $2
billion of funds, or less than one-sixth of what Mr. Lynch
did, "because when you get that big, you end up doing more
managing than the actual analysis -- which is what I do
best."
