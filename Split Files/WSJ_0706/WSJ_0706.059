   Now that President Bush has opened the door for "tax
revenue increases," a curious alliance is emerging between
environmentalists and gasoline users that could speed passage
of a broad-based tax on the production of carbon dioxide.
Early estimates are that such a tax could raise at least $30
billion during its first five years. But while a carbon tax
sounds good in theory, practice might be another story.
   Recent converts to free-market principles, such as the
National Wildlife Federation, support a carbon tax as a fix
to the global warming problem that would work far more
smoothly than complex command-and-control regulations on
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Auto makers,
truckers and other industries heavily dependent on cheap
transportation fuels see the tax as a way to short-circuit a
gasoline tax increase, shifting the burden to other
industries that also are major producers of carbon dioxide.

   The White House has not taken a position on carbon taxes,
but the "troika" -- Chief of Staff John Sununu; Richard
Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and
Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
-- is intrigued by such taxes. This year's Council of
Economic Advisers annual report, for example, devotes
considerable attention to the merits of market-tuned emission
taxes.
   Understandably, opponents of carbon taxes include the coal
and electric industries and the big energy producing and
consuming states. They fear that legislation introduced last
month by Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) could become an easy
vehicle by which the House Ways and Means Committee could
speed the tax through. They note that it wasn't until this
time last year that the notion of a chlorofluorocarbon tax
was introduced; six months later it had passed and gone into
effect.
   The Stark bill would tax coal at $15 a ton, petroleum at
$3.25 a barrel and natural gas at 40 cents per thousand cubic
feet. Unlike the very simple chlorofluorocarbon tax levied on
Du Pont and the small number of CFC producers, a carbon tax
would by its nature be broad-based and require a complex
allocation of responsibilities. If applied equitably, it
could be levied at the source -- the coal mine, for example
-- and on the end-user.
   Among the drawbacks of a carbon tax:
   -- It would fall more heavily on some parts of the country
than others. Western coal- and oil-producing regions and
Midwestern coal-burning regions would both be hit hard.
   -- Domestic coal, which supplies 60% of America's
electricity and will be even more crucial in the future
unless nuclear power is revived, would be hit
disproportionately hard if a tax is levied that does not
consider environmental-control technologies that alter actual
emissions. Coal exports could be mortally wounded.
   -- A carbon tax could inadvertently encourage more imports
of oil. Swapping part of the budget deficit for a larger
trade deficit may not be prudent policy.
   -- A U.S.-only tax could further reduce American
competitiveness.
   -- Many utilities are scampering to finance billions of
dollars in upgrades to meet the acid-rain provisions of the
Clean Air Act legislation that Congress is expected to
finally pass this fall. These same utilities would be the
most likely candidates to pay a hefty carbon tax.
   -- A carbon tax -- if not set at the right level, tied to
changing energy prices and to capital costs -- might not lead
to significant carbon dioxide cuts if industry decided it was
cheaper to pay a tax than to clean up older plants. Instead
of encouraging energy efficiency, it could bias the energy
industry against new capital investments.
   -- While a carbon tax might reduce overall carbon dioxide
emissions, it would not provide crucial incentives for the
U.S. and other nations to engage in reforestation and other
environmental goals.
   -- Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas. A
meaningful first response to global climate change is to
develop a greenhouse-gas index that compares the impacts of
various gases on the environment and allows countries to
establish their own priorities among the various greenhouse
gases -- including CFCs, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
oxide.
   -- Finally, before Congress and the administration move
any farther down the carbon-tax path, they must earmark the
revenue for environmental and energy projects. More likely,
the revenue would go for increased government spending in
other areas.
   A carefully constructed strategy makes sense once we know
more about global warming and the pacing of necessary
actions. And a carefully constructed increase in taxes also
makes sense. It could be devastating to the U.S., however, to
get carried away by a naive belief that fixing the deficit
and the environment is only a matter of working out a few
mechanical details at some late-night congressional
conference.
