   HOUSTON -- For three days next week the eyes of the world
will be upon Texas. And Houston wants to take advantage of
the situation.
   The thousands of red begonias and the 126 spanking new
police cars that will be much in evidence are but small parts
of a big scheme to put the best face on the city for the
annual economic summit of industrialized nations that begins
Monday.

   Some 4,000 journalists will be here doing stories, and
Houston wants at least some of that to result in business for
Houston -- global financing for new development, for
instance, in a city that has been depressed since the bottom
dropped out of oil and that is just now coming back.
   Houston could use a little respect; it feels the need to
be noticed.
   "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this city,"
exclaims advertising executive Larry Taylor, who, along with
many Houstonians, is hyperbolic about what next week's summit
means for his town.
   Never mind that reporters keep telling the city's phalanx
of PR people that they are coming to write about the summit
itself. "Reporters are less interested in Houston than in the
seven leaders" who are holding talks here, says Peter
Riddell, Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times of
London.
   Never mind that the ranks of summit journalists have been
thinned by a London meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and by the Soviet Party Congress in Moscow,
competing news events of recent days. Many press people will
be too pooped from those trips to pursue what they see as
civic-boosterism fluff in the Houston metro area. "We don't
have much time to go around," says Pascal Taillandier of
Agence France Presse.
   The city was taken aback to learn a few weeks ago that
although Thatcher, Kohl and Mitterrand will be here,
Jennings, Brokaw and Rather sent regrets.
   "It was a real blow," says Alex Kopatic, another of those
hyping Houston to reporters. "Disappointment was severe."
That the networks weren't dropping anchor in Houston was
front-page news in the Houston Post and a major preoccupation
of the nation's fourth-largest city for several days.
   The networks will, of course, have people here next week,
but not their biggest people. And that grates. Dan Rather of
CBS, is after all, a native son. George Bush calls Houston
home, too. Which is why the summit is to be here in the first
place. (Local television reporters noted this week that a
newspaper in Japan did write about Houston and used a
photograph of Mayor Kathy Whitmire.)
   Heads of state are important people, but so far as Houston
is concerned, the summit's most important people are the
journalists. "The international press was the major benefit
we saw" in playing host to the summit, says Mayor Whitmire.
   Houston's breathlessness about media coverage is, to a
great extent, a byproduct of its recent wrenching financial
hard times. The thin-skinned energy capital got bruised
considerably as reporters wrote graphic stories in the
mid-1980s detailing what the crash in oil prices did to this
once high-flying region, says Lyn Johnson, the summit's
deputy communications director. Now that it has them here for
the summit, Houston wants to convince reporters that it is no
longer on the mat.
   About 50 summit workers have been cranking out press
releases at the rate of two a week since April. They have
delivered more than 5,000, 200-page Houston reference guides
and set up plans to serve food to the press round the clock
during the three-day summit. (Japanese reporters, writing for
Tokyo deadlines, will be able to take their dinners at 3 a.m.
if they wish to.) Reporters too busy to go out on the town in
search of stories about Houston can visit booths and speakers
at press headquarters more than glad to provide information
about the city's huge medical center, its space and oil
industries and whatnot.
   Summit handlers have even figured out how to finesse
Houston's miserable summer weather. "Houston's Hot," is the
city's upbeat summit slogan. Mr. Taylor, the adman, says he
came up with the very apt line during the first 10 minutes of
a brainstorming session. Still, he says, it took a committee
three weeks of wrangling to approve it. People were worried
that it would just encourage unwanted stories about the local
climate. Otherwise, who would notice the 95-degree days and
the 90% humidity?
   Reporters who do venture out into the blistering heat of
this sprawling town will see how Houston has gussied itself
up. City horticulturist Dee Howell, for instance, exhorted
Houstonians to plant red and white flowers around their
houses. "They have a lot of image impact," she says,
"especially a lot of television impact."
   Texas Commerce Bank employees volunteered to spend a
weekend planting 8,500 red begonias around Rice University
where the summitteers will hold their meetings.
Unfortunately, says Brandy Wolf, who organized the planting,
"there's no sprinkler system." Fortunately, a landscaping
concern donated its services in trucking in water to keep the
blossoms on the begonias until Chancellor Kohl and network
television have left town.
   That's typical. A lot of Houston's image burnishing for
the summit is cosmetic and temporary. The city's skyscrapers,
for instance, are going to leave lights on at night to look
good for the cameras. Also, Houston isn't fining sidewalk
vendors for the time being. "We're trying to foster a street
life," says Ross Allyn, a city-council aide. "This is
directed at the 4,000 reporters coming to town," he adds.
   The police were equally matter-of-fact about holding back
126 new squad cars for more than two months so as to keep
them in factory-fresh condition for summit motorcades.
   Having the cars but not being able to use them has caused
some annoyance on the force in recent weeks. Mark Clark, a
Houston policeman and head of an officers' association, says,
"We're just barely getting by" with the vehicles in the
department's aging 1,000-car fleet. "The cars break down."
Veteran Houston radio journalist Garvin Berry chimed in: The
summit has "warped {the} judgment" of civic leaders.
   James Harrington, legal director for the Texas Civil
Liberties Union in Austin, attacked another decision. The 14
judges who hear criminal misdemeanor cases here met last
month and decided to double the bail bonds, to $1,000, for
out-of-state protesters who get arrested during the summit.
The step is necessary, they said, to ensure that itinerant
wrongdoers return to Houston for trial later on.
   "That's just a pretext for punishing speech," says Mr.
Harrington. "They just want to have a nice, clean, antiseptic
summit."
   A number of demonstrators, ranging from the Ku Klux Klan
to anti-abortion activists, nevertheless are expected in
Houston next week. The higher bonds will hardly affect
protester turnout, says Jimi Clark, march organizer for the
Poor People's Campaign for Economic Justice.
   Summit planners considered asking judges to keep
sensational cases off their dockets during summit week, but,
under fire, abandoned the idea. Mr. Harrington says, "These
people need a lesson in democracy."
   So the city is uptight, as perhaps any city might be. And
it wants to take advantage of the photo opportunity, as any
city would. Indeed, organizers of the 1988 summit in Toronto
told Houston planners that they wish they had done more to
capitalize on the affair when they had the chance. "It's an
opportunity wherever the summit is held," says Albert Louer,
who helped set up the 1983 summit in Williamsburg, Va. "It
would be somewhat ridiculous not to" take advantage of it.
   Still, Bill Simon, a University of Houston sociology
professor, maintains that "Houston has always been
self-conscious" because it grew so big so fast. As cities go,
it is an adolescent. Its population has grown rapidly in
recent years, and most of the skyscrapers that give the city
its impressive modernistic skyline (especially when they are
lit up at night) are new in the past decade.
   A classic, adolescent identity crisis manifested itself
when the Special Events Committee for the summit was trying
to decide between rodeo and ballet as entertainment for the
visiting dignitaries and media people. City planners asked
the city's opera, symphony and ballet to work on a program.
"We want to do away with the redneck image," says Tony
Lentini, a public-relations volunteer. But the decision was
countermanded by President Bush, wearing his Texas hat not
his Connecticut hat. Wanting a down-home event, he insisted
on an evening of barbecue, rodeo and country music. en
