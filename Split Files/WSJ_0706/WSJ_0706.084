   Family-Firm Advisers
   May Need More Training

   MORE CONSULTANTS are rushing to help family-owned
businesses.
   But veteran family-business consultants say too many
newcomers lack credentials for untangling complex
family-business issues, such as succession and sibling
rivalry.
   Rod Correll, executive director of the Family Firm
Institute, says, "The interest in family-business consulting
seems to have doubled over the last two years. And there is
no mechanism for credentials." Membership in the Johnstown,
N.Y.-based institute, an organization of consultants and
others serving family businesses, also has doubled, to 500
members this year from about 250 in 1988.
   New programs for family-business owners are proliferating
-- not to mention books, magazine articles and university
courses -- in a nod to the growing awareness of family
problems affecting small businesses. In September, the Center
for Management at the Institute of Living, a psychiatric
hospital in Hartford, Conn., will begin quarterly seminars to
help 50 firms resolve family tensions.
   No figures are available on the newcomers catering to
family businesses, but they range from accountants to family
therapists. Added to those are many big companies that didn't
target family businesses a decade ago -- like the accounting
concerns Laventhol &amp; Horwath and Grant Thornton, as well as
Wall Street firms like Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. --
which recently expanded into the booming field.
   But John Messervey, longtime director of the National
Family Business Council, a Northbrook, Ill., consulting firm,
says many newcomers have "invested much in marketing and
little in training. Frankly, many are not equipped to handle
the problems."
   The Family Firm Institute conference in Atlanta in October
will discuss possible qualifications and credentials for the
field.
                                                                                                       

   Small-Business Issues
   Swell PAC War Chest
                                                                                                       

   POLITICAL GIVING by small-business owners is increasing in
the wake of heightened congressional interest in issues
important to small companies, says the National Federation of
Independent Business.
   The largest national small-business organization says
contributions to its political action committee war chest
jumped to $214,000 in 1989. While relatively small by PAC
standards, that's still three times more than the group ever
collected before in a year with no congressional elections.
   The federation's PAC receipts have passed $300,000 for the
two-year election cycle ending this year; the goal is
$500,000.
   As previously reported, small companies also have
increased lobbying efforts. Their concern over matters that
came before Congress this year -- such as federal regulation
of fringe benefits, required company leave for new parents
and an increased minimum wage -- also helped swell the PAC
war chest, says John Motley, the federation's chief lobbyist.
"People give when they're scared and angry," he says.
   Mr. Motley says the federation ran its PAC "as an
afterthought" until 1987, when it overhauled its political
fund-raising machine to make it more effective. He says the
federation now identifies members who are "proven givers,"
goes to them repeatedly for contributions and specifically
acknowledges their donations.
   But the group is helping candidates in other ways besides
PAC contributions. For instance, Mr. Motley says the
federation is recruiting its members to work in local races
for candidates with pro-small-business backgrounds. "Now
we're doing the things the unions have been doing for years,"
he says.
                                                                                                       

   Franchise Rules Are
   Back Off Drawing Board
                                                                                                       

   THE REVISED DRAFT on legislation to regulate franchising
was made public last month -- and the most controversial
parts had been excised.
   A committee of the North American Securities
Administrators Association released the revision for public
comment, says committee head Debra M. Bollinger, director of
South Dakota's securities division. The original draft was
released last July. "Substantial redrafting has been done in
almost all of the sections," Ms. Bollinger says, and several
sections were eliminated.
   The committee hopes the revised draft will be adopted as a
model for state franchising legislation. Ms. Bollinger says
the association, whose members are involved in state
regulation of franchises, is expected to consider the matter
at a meeting in August.
   Many franchisers opposed the group's original proposal for
a Model Franchise Investment Act, says David J. Kaufmann, a
franchising lawyer in New York. He says they particularly
disliked provisions regarding termination of franchises. For
example, the original draft would have required franchisers
to buy goods and equipment of terminated franchisees. Mr.
Kaufmann called that draft "another effort to kill -- or at
least overregulate -- the goose that laid the golden egg."
   But the newest draft contains no such provisions.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN companies can sell directly to Soviet business
managers through an American Business Directory for the
U.S.S.R. Amtorg Trading Corp., owned by various Soviet
enterprises, and International Delaware Corp., both New
York-based trade assistance companies, have about 380,000
prepaid subscriptions for their joint project. . . . Top
executives of firms with up to $50 million in sales got
"moderate" base salary increases of 5.6% from 1988 to 1989, a
survey of 1,400 executives says. The average chief executive
in such a firm earned a 1989 base salary of $116,500, Ernst &amp;
Young found.
