   HOMESTEAD, Pa. -- Not every young manager would give up a
career at Twentieth Century Fox and an apartment on a
California beach to help run his father's troubled business
in this onetime flourishing steel community.
   But that's what David Frischman, a marketing manager, did
when his father died of cancer four years ago. He joined his
brother, Les, then a Los Angeles executive recruiter, and his
sister, Cindy Frischman-Notkin, who had remained here, in a
struggle to save the company. Since then, the siblings have
shown how second-generation entrepreneurs using modern
methods can often succeed where the founder stumbled.

   For years, their father, Milton, had worked for his
brother in a linen business. Just 18 months before he died,
Milton invested his life's savings to start Commercial
Textiles Inc., a small business selling uniforms wholesale to
restaurants and hotels.
   When he died of lung cancer, the prospects for the
business seemed so bleak that the family's accountants and
financial advisers urged Mr. Frischman's widow, Rosalyn, and
her children to cut their losses and close the company.
   But the children vowed to keep the business going. "It was
hard giving up Los Angeles, and it was scary coming back, but
my mom and sister couldn't handle the business by
themselves," says 31-year-old Les, company treasurer.
   The family decided that the troubled business had strong
prospects nationwide. To reach customers outside western
Pennsylvania, where their father had concentrated, they
turned to a new marketing strategy.
   They invested $30,000 in a computer system that allows
them to quickly track inventories and customers. Armed with
this system, a toll-free telephone number that attracted
customers from across the country and slick advertising
brochures, the children have increased the business's
clientele to more than 2,000 hotels, restaurants and country
clubs -- from only 50 clients four years ago.
   "The computer gives us information my father would have
never dreamed of," says Les. Adds David, who is company
president: "My father used the old style of bookkeeping,
writing in ledger books and adding by hand. The computer
system makes payables and receivables very easy." It also
helps Commercial Textiles service orders faster than many
similar companies, giving the company an important
competitive edge, the brothers say.
   The first hurdle, however, was scrounging up capital. To
get the business on its feet, the Frischmans took out a
$40,000 loan. After walking from bank to bank and receiving
several "polite no's," they finally got a "yes" from Equimark
Corp.'s Equibank in Pittsburgh.
   To find customers, the Frischmans ordered telephone
directories from major U.S. cities and personally contacted
managers at numerous hotels and restaurants.
   They also found that customers, such as restaurateur Tell
Erhart, responded to care and attention to detail. After one
wholesaler messed up his uniform order, Mr. Erhart went to
Commercial Textiles. "You call them up, give them the sizes
and they ship it out. Usually at big outlets, you're just a
number," says Mr. Erhart, who owns Chef Tell's Grand Old
House on the Caribbean island Grand Cayman.
   The Frischmans use uniform manufacturers in Philadelphia
and Union City, N.J. Unlike some competitors, they will
handle special orders involving embroidery or silk screening.
And at their recently expanded two-floor office on
Homestead's main street, they're shipping about 40 orders a
day, David Frischman says.
   This year, the company expects earnings of about $300,000,
up from $190,000 last year, he says. Sales this year, he
adds, should exceed $1 million -- a marked improvement from
the $20,000 of four years ago.
   Although the business now includes a secretary and a
warehouse supervisor, family members do most everything else.
David Frischman is in charge of advertising, Les Frischman
oversees computer operations and Mrs. Frischman-Notkin
handles marketing. Their mother contacts prospective hotel
and restaurant customers by telephone. And when it comes to
packing, unpacking and stocking the boxes, they all roll up
their sleeves.
   Mrs. Frischman-Notkin recalls that when her father started
the business, there was never enough money for paychecks.
"Every penny we made went back into the business," she says.
   While there are paychecks today, none of the Frischmans
has yet become wealthy. Les Frischman says he is drawing just
$26,000 a year in pay, less than half what he earned in Los
Angeles.
   And of course, the former Californians now overlook
abandoned Homestead steel mills instead of beaches. But they
say they'll keep the company here even if it outgrows its
premises. "Even the name Homestead sounds very quaint," David
Frischman says.
