   DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. said it is temporarily halting
production at four of its assembly plants to prepare for
model changeovers.
   The nation's No. 3 auto maker said it is idling for two
weeks its production facilities in Belvidere, Ill., Newark,
N.J., Sterling Heights, Mich., and St. Louis. The plants
build the New Yorker, Imperial, LeBaron, Plymouth Acclaim,
Plymouth Sundance, Dodge Spirit, Dodge Shadow and Dodge
Daytona. About 10,050 hourly workers will be temporarily
idled by the moves, which take effect Monday.

   Chrysler said its assembly plant in Belvidere will be
closed an additional week because of slow sales. That plant
will resume production July 30.
   General Motors Corp. said it will close its assembly
plants in Van Nuys, Calif., for two weeks beginning Monday,
because of slow sales of the Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac
Firebirds built there. The auto maker also said it will halt
assembly for the two weeks at its Willow Run, Mich., plant to
prepare for production of fleet and special-use vehicles,
such as taxicabs and police cars. The plant builds the
Chevrolet Corsica.
   As previously reported, Ford Motor Co.'s assembly plants
will be idle next week, for the auto maker's traditional
summer break.
   Overall, the 10 major auto makers in the U.S. planned to
build 70,022 units this week, a 71% increase over 40,925
built a year ago.
