   LONDON -- Two top Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. executives
dismissed in May intend to buy or set up their own ad agency,
posing a potential competitive threat to the troubled
communications giant.
   "We are still in the formative and design stage" for the
would-be business, said Terry Bannister, ousted along with
Roy Warman as joint chief executive officers of the company's
advertising operations after a boardroom power struggle. "But
in all probability, it will be in London" and will begin
operations by year end, he said in a telephone interview
yesterday. The pair had considered becoming ad industry
consultants, Mr. Bannister said, but "you don't only want to
make the bullets. You want to fire them as well."

   Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Saatchi's new chief executive
officer, fired the two men after attempting to demote them by
slashing their corporate responsibilities. Messrs. Bannister
and Warman were expected to receive contract settlements of
roughly #1.25 million ($2.22 million) apiece that also would
exclude them from the British advertising industry for four
years. Each was earning about #345,000 a year before
Saatchi's directors voted them a 10% pay cut earlier this
year. Each executive had almost four years left on a
five-year contract.
   Mr. Bannister said the two now hope to complete a
settlement with Saatchi by the end of July giving them the
freedom to operate an agency. They likely will receive
smaller severance packages, continue as Saatchi consultants
and accept fairly loose limits on recruiting Saatchi clients
and staffers. "We are moving forward with an agreement in
principle with the company that's now being crafted by the
lawyers," Mr. Bannister said.
   The accord would prevent the ex-Saatchi executives from
soliciting any current Saatchi advertising business "that we
have been in charge of and highly influential over," he said.
That prohibition might cover only parts of the world-wide
Saatchi empire, Mr. Bannister noted. And it wouldn't prevent
Saatchi clients from switching as long as the pair didn't
actively recruit them.
   Indeed, similar restrictions didn't stop one Saatchi
client from awarding an approximately #1.25 million account
yesterday to a breakaway shop formed in May by seven former
officials of Saatchi's flagship London advertising agency.
Reckitt &amp; Colman PLC, a British consumer-products concern,
said it chose Cowan, Kemsley, Taylor Ltd. to handle
everything but media buying for its U.K. household-cleaner
brand Dettox.
   In the same way, any new agency created by Messrs. Warman
and Bannister might lure unhappy staffers from Saatchi's
London agency, Britain's largest, which they once ran.
"There's always the threat that other disaffected people
within Saatchi might find the opportunity {attractive} of
joining Roy and Terry in a new agency {rather} than toughing
it out at Charlotte Street," the London agency's nickname,
suggested David Forster, an advertising analyst at U.K.
brokers Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. "There's a
danger that {Saatchi} would lose people as well as business."
   A Saatchi spokesman said the company continues to
negotiate a severance package with Messrs. Warman and
Bannister, but declined to comment about details. He also
dismissed the loss of the Dettox account, saying, "it's not
terribly significant anyway."

   Boyle Brands Moved
                                                                                                       

   Reckitt &amp; Colman, following its acquisition of American
Home Products's Boyle Midway unit, pulled its newly acquired
brands from Young &amp; Rubicam and McCann-Erickson and placed
them at a number of smaller shops.
   Wayne, N.J.-based Reckitt &amp; Colman, a unit of Reckitt &amp;
Colman PLC, said its ad budget, which includes a number of
brands that aren't switching agencies, totals more than $40
million. A spokesman refused to say how much the brands it is
moving will bill separately.
   TBWA Advertising was perhaps the biggest winner, picking
up the Woolite and Neet brands. According to Leading National
Advertisers, a tracking firm, Woolite billed about $13
million last year; Neet billed about $2 million.
   Bloom Agency, a unit of Bloom Cos., picked up Easy Off
oven cleaner, which spent about $3 million in 1989, and two
other small brands. Campbell-Mithun-Esty, a unit of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, won Wizard air fresheners; Partners &amp; Shevack picked
up the Holiday insecticide line.
   Bloom, C-M-E and Partners &amp; Shevack already handle other
Reckitt &amp; Colman accounts. The company spokesman said the
changes reflected a desire to consolidate its advertising at
fewer shops.
   McCann-Erickson, an Interpublic Group agency, had Easy Off
and also a large chunk of the Woolite business. Young &amp;
Rubicam had part of the Woolite account, as well as Neet,
Wizard and a number of other small brands. It continues to
handle American Home's Pam and Butter Buds brands.
