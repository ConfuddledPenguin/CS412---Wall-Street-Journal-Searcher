   NEW YORK -- Gannett Co. is expected to report its first
quarterly earnings drop from a year earlier since the company
went public more than 22 years ago, ending one of the longer
streaks in corporate annals and signaling that an
industrywide slump has finally taken hold at the country's
largest newspaper company.
   Gannett's vice chairman and chief financial officer,
Douglas McCorkindale said in an interview yesterday that he
can't disagree with the conclusions of some Wall Street
analysts, who expect the company to post second-quarter net
income below the year-earlier $112.1 million, or 70 cents a
share. In May, ad revenues fell 4.3% at Gannett's 82 daily
newspapers, and "business continues to be soft. We aren't
seeing any significant business in June," Mr. McCorkindale
said. He declined to predict any specific figures and said
the company will issue its second-quarter report next week.

   Peter Appert, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., expects Gannett to report earnings of about $109.7
million, or 68 cents a share, for the second quarter. "It's
not a conclusion I'll disagree with," Mr. McCorkindale said
of the analyst's forecast.
   Mr. Appert said Gannett's earnings are being hurt by
continued weak retail and classified newspaper linage at the
company's dailies. "The simple fact," he added, "is that
Gannett will continue to report disappointing earnings until
the ad revenue environment improves."
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Susan Decker also
expects results to be down slightly, although earnings could
be flat after counting a small gain from the recent sale of a
Gannett radio station. She expects classified advertising
will "continue to get worse" for Gannett and most newspaper
companies. She added that major newspaper companies' earnings
growth, which averaged about 15% through the past decade,
will slow to about 8% for the 1990s.
   The gloomy projections come at a crucial time for Gannett.
The Gannett Foundation, the company's largest shareholder,
plans to sell its 10% stake, raising the possibility that
Gannett may be put into play as a possible takeover target --
particularly if its stock price falls on bad earnings news.
   The foundation, headed by former Gannett Chairman Allen
Neuharth, is sorting through several potential bidders and
waiting for the company's stock price to rebound. Shares
traded as high as $55.25 in 1987 and were at $36.75 when the
foundation announced the planned sale on April 26. The stock
has been slowly rising since. It closed yesterday at $37.125
a share, down 37.5 cents, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   In the past, Gannett executives have boasted of the string
of earnings gains. Even in the recent ad slump, Gannett, with
papers spread across 36 states, has managed to post some of
the industry's strongest earnings. Earnings at most other
major publishers have been weakened by declines in retail and
classified ad spending, particularly in Northeastern states.
   Gannett went public in October 1967 and since then has
logged earnings gains from the year-earlier period for 89
consecutive quarters. Gannett barely kept the string alive in
the first quarter of 1990, posting net earnings of $75
million, or 47 cents a share, only $100,000 higher than in
the year-earlier quarter.
