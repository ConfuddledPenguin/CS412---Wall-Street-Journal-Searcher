   WASHINGTON -- The American Institute of Architects, a
Washington trade group, settled federal antitrust charges
that it had discouraged competitive bidding and discounts by
its 55,000 members.
   Although the AIA denied any wrongdoing, it agreed to a
proposed court order that would block it from barring or
deterring architects from competitive bidding, discounting
fees and providing free services.

   The proposed court order, or consent decree, was filed in
federal court in Washington by the Justice Department and
requires a judge's approval. The decree would settle civil
charges by the department, including the allegation that the
Chicago chapter of the AIA in 1984 adopted a policy statement
prohibiting practices such as competitive bidding and
discounting. Federal antitrust prosecutors had investigated
the group for four years.
   David Perdue, the AIA's associate general counsel, said
such statements "reflected anxieties and concerns about
financial returns of {architectural} firms" in the mid-1980s.
But he insisted that the policy statements hadn't affected
architects' fees. Mr. Perdue said the AIA agreed to the
consent decree to prevent the cost and distraction of a
trial. The decree would require the architects group to pay
$50,000 to the government for the expense of its
investigation. Mr. Perdue said the group has already spent $2
million in legal fees in connection with the investigation.
   The Justice Department investigated alleged antitrust
violations by the AIA in the early 1970s. That inquiry
resulted in a narrower consent decree barring restrictions on
competitive bidding.
