   Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, the French
state-controlled oil company, said it agreed with Amoco Corp.
to purchase most of the Chicago-based energy company's
so-called downstream, or refining and marketing, operations
in Britain by Aug. 1.
   The business included in the transaction would double
Elf's share of the British petroleum market, the company
said. About 200 service stations will be handed over to Elf,
along with a 70% effective interest in the 100,000
barrel-a-day Milford Haven refinery, and various terminal and
pipeline interests.

   Elf said the arrangement won't include Amoco's synthetic
fabrics operations in Britain. British affiliates of other
Amoco units, such as Amoco U.K. Exploration Co. and Amoco
Chemical, also won't be affected by the sale.
   The purchase is part of Elf's strategy of reinforcing its
distribution network, after closing about 40% of its European
service stations in the past six years.
