   ("Decaffeinated coffee may raise cholesterol and increase
chances of heart disease." -- News item)
                                                                                                       

   So my decaf's bad?
   That news gives fright --
   It will make me lie
   Awake all night.

   "Two can live as cheaply as one"
   Is a maxim we've long enjoyed.
   I'm glad to say it's still true today --
   As long as the two are employed.
   -- Gail Cooke.
