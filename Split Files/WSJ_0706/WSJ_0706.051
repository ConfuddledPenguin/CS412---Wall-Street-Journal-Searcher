   NEW YORK -- Money managers slightly outperformed the
overall stock market in the first half, with managers
specializing in growth and small stocks leading the pack.
   The stock portfolios of investment managers gained an
average of 3.1% in the first six months of this year,
according to performance figures compiled by CDA Investment
Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md. Before subtracting fees,
the first-half results were a tad ahead of the 3% gain for
the overall market as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.

   All of the first-half gains came in the second quarter;
the average manager's portfolio sustained a loss of 3.2% in
the first quarter, according to CDA's calculations. The S&amp;P
index fell 3% in the first three months.
   For the 12 months ended June 30, stock managers posted a
gain of 13.7%, according to CDA's calculations, compared with
16.4% for the S&amp;P 500.
   Extending a trend begun last year, growth and small-stock
managers have taken the spotlight in the recent performance
rankings, far outshining investment advisers who favor the
big stocks that dominate the S&amp;P 500. The run-up in big
stocks began to flag last year, when both the takeover boom
and earnings increases among the large-capitalization issues
started to turn soft.
   Says growth-stock manager John Sullivan: "Since mid-1989,
it has been a growth-stock market, and we have been in the
right pew." He's a partner in Harris, Bretall, Sullivan &amp;
Smith in San Francisco, which was one of the top-performing
money-management firms in the first half.
   Mr. Sullivan, whose firm manages about $350 million of
stocks, says he and his partners have had little trouble
coming up with a portfolio of 40 well-known stocks, each with
earnings growing in the area of 20% a year. The firm makes
big bets on stock groups it thinks will do well, even at the
expense of diversity.
   So Harris Bretall has 32% of its portfolio in technology
stocks such as Compaq Computer Corp., Automatic Data
Processing Inc., Intel Corp., Motorola Inc., Novell Inc.,
Oracle Systems Corp. and Microsoft Inc. It also considers
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. a technology holding.
   Another 30% of the portfolio consists of a hodgepodge of
capital equipment, environmental and other industrial
concerns. Here the firm likes Browning-Ferris Industries
Inc., Waste Management Inc. and even one aerospace maker,
Boeing Co. In the drug area, with a 15% allocation, holdings
include Merck &amp; Co., Upjohn Co., Abbott Laboratories and St.
Jude Medical Inc.
   Harris Bretall has stayed fully invested in stocks and,
despite skeptics, thinks the corporate earnings picture is
getting brighter. "I suspect you're seeing the trough in
earnings," says Mr. Sullivan. "They're going to look better
in the third and fourth quarters and into 1991," he says.
   Provident Investment Counsel, Pasadena, Calif., another
top-performing growth manager with about $3.6 billion in
stocks under management, says companies with strong earnings
momentum could benefit even in a softening economy. "In that
kind of an environment, {investment} money seeks a place that
it can count on as a haven," bolstering growth stocks, says
Robert Kommerstad, Provident's chairman.
   Among Provident's strong performers are Walt Disney Co.,
Reuters PLC, Toys "R" Us Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and
that favorite growth stock, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ("You must
have heard that 1,000 times from growth managers," Mr.
Kommerstad says of Wal-Mart.) Software makers Microsoft Corp.
and Autodesk Inc. also are favorites.
   The turnaround in growth stocks is helping growth managers
land much of the new money entering the stock market, he
says. "You're starting to see a seminar here and there on
growth-stock investing," according to Mr. Kommerstad. "You
haven't seen that for years."
   George Yeager, head of New York-based Yeager, Wood &amp;
Marshall, another top-performing growth manager with nearly
$500 million in assets, says strong growth issues such as
Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola Co., McDonald's Corp. and Disney "are not
dependent on the business cycle" for much of their
performance.
   Mr. Yeager says the stocks he holds carry a price-earnings
multiple 1.3 times that of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index.
But their earnings are growing four times as fast as the S&amp;P
stocks. "That's just about the best trade-off in our
professional experience, and it's going to be good for quite
some time," he says.
   Some managers specializing in small stocks also did well
in the first half.
   Amerindo U.S. Advisors Inc. of Larkspur, Calif., which
buys nothing but electronic and biotechnology stocks at their
initial public offerings and sells them when they reach
annual sales of $300 million, topped the list of managers
during the period, as it did in the first quarter. The firm
has about $450 million under management.
   Amerindo's latest newsletter is bullish on the market,
saying it looks for a "spectacular third-leg in an extended
run that ought to carry over into the early 1990s."
Specifically, it predicts the Dow Jones Industrial Average
will break out of the "2500-2800 trading mode that it has
been in since last July by moving up to the 2700-3000 trading
area, before ultimately breaking out again on the upside."
   Amerindo recommends "aggressive" buying of stocks such as
Sequent Computer Systems Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Chiron
Corp. and Amgen Inc.
   "In the first six months, earnings drove the market, and
that favored our stocks," says William Jeffery of Wall Street
Associates Inc., another manager specializing in small
stocks. The firm, based in La Jolla, Calif., with about $400
million under management. Like Amerindo, Wall Street
Associates greatly outperformed one measure of small stocks,
the Russell 2000, which rose 0.48% in the first half.
   Mr. Jeffery says there is an "ample supply" of stocks with
market capitalization under $400 million and superior
earnings growth. "They probably will be able to survive an
economic slowdown better than their bigger brethren, simply
because they are more focused and have niches in the market,"
he says.
   Among Mr. Jeffery's favorites: Software Toolworks Inc.,
Conner Peripherals Inc., Cirrus Logic Inc. and Wholesale Club
Inc.
   CDA compiles performance data based on reports that money
managers are required to file quarterly with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Because of gaps in the filings, the
data aren't precise. They assume, for example, that the stock
holdings remain in the managers' portfolios for the entire
quarter. Cash holdings, bonds, convertible securities,
foreign issues and short sales aren't included.
   Returns also haven't been reduced to reflect the managers'
fees. In addition, the various levels of risk that the
managers took to achieve their results aren't considered.
