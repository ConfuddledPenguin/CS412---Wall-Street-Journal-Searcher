   NEW YORK -- A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed an
insider trading suit against Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., an
investment affiliate of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   The suit alleged that the investment company sold its
12.6% stake in Texas Air Corp., or about 5.3 million shares,
on Jan. 24 based on insider knowledge. The next day, Eastern
Air Lines, one of Texas Air's two carriers, met with
unsecured creditors to outline a reorganization plan under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the lawsuit
contended. Details of the plan were disclosed that same day,
causing the stock price to drop.

   The lawsuit, filed at the end of January by a Texas Air
shareholder, was immediately called "frivolous" and "absurd"
by New England Mutual executives. Charles L. Finlayson,
general counsel at Loomis, said that G. Kenneth Heebner, then
Loomis's investment manager, had decided to sell the Texas
Air stock because increased competition led him to reduce his
earnings estimates for the airline. Mr. Finlayson said Mr.
Heebner began selling the stock at least six weeks before the
final block of about 3.4 million shares was sold on Jan. 24.
   Last Monday, attorneys for the shareholder, Frank Debora,
filed a stipulation of dismissal with Judge Kevin Thomas
Duffy of U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Judge Duffy
approved the dismissal yesterday.
   "I'm just satisfied that it has been put behind us," said
Loomis's Mr. Finlayson. "The suit should never have been
filed in the first place."
