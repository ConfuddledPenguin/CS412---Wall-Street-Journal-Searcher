   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
expelled two firms and sanctioned several firms and
individuals for alleged rule violations.
   D'Martine Financial Services Inc. and principal Peter J.
Rumsavich, both of Rolling Meadows, Ill., were fined a total
of $50,000. The firm was expelled, and Mr. Rumsavich was
barred from membership. Among other charges, NASD said, the
firm failed to maintain required net capital, and it
deposited funds from subscribers to a limited partnership
offering in an account Mr. Rumsavich controlled rather than
in an escrow or trust account.

   D'Martine's Mr. Rumsavich said: "We've been trying to
withdraw from the NASD for 2 1/2 years. We've been going
through an audit. Our total commissions for the past three
years have been $2,000 a year. Isn't it just like the NASD to
tag us with a $50,000 fine and know that we will not pursue
the matter any further to save a $2,000 commission base?"
   Baldwin Capital Partners was expelled, and principal
George Horace Baldwin was fined $5,000, suspended as a
principal for two years and required to requalify for the
position. The firm and Mr. Baldwin, both of Tiburon, Calif.,
didn't respond to NASD requests for information, the
self-regulatory agency for the over-the-counter market said.
   U.S. Advisors Inc. of Novato, Calif., and an associate,
Paul M. Misch of Chicago, were fined a total of $35,000, and
Mr. Misch was barred. They failed to file certain reports and
failed to respond to requests for information, the NASD
charged.
   American Wallstreet Securities Inc., Tampa, Fla., and two
Brandon, Fla., principals, Eric J. Walloga and Kevin D. Ward,
were fined a total of $14,000. The firm and executives didn't
admit or deny any wrongdoing in connection with NASD charges
that the firm charged excessive markups on securities of 20%
to 88% above market levels.
   Meridian Associates Inc. and principal Jack R. Wolff, both
of Sarasota, Fla., were fined a total of $10,000, and Mr.
Wolff was suspended for three business days. Without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings
that the firm operated three offices with 34 representatives
when an accord with the NASD limited the firm to one office
and six representatives.
   Mr. Wolff, Meridian's founder and president, said: "The
action taken is a reflection of both our growth and an
apparent oversight on our part in the 1987-1988 time frame to
advise the NASD in advance of our expansion. . . . Meridian
is a member in good standing with the NASD and is continuing
its growth in accordance with the company's business plan."

   Mr. Cruchon said the NASD's allegations are "not true,"
adding: "They can do what they want to. I didn't have the
money to fight it, or it wouldn't have been done. I was a
scapegoat. They let off {Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.}
and some other people, and there was one left. I just feel
like a scapegoat."
   Messrs. Gentry, Nahmias, Rosa and Shaw declined to
comment.
