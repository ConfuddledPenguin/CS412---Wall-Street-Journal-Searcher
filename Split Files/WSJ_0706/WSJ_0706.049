   NEW YORK -- Five insiders at Players International Inc.
sold $2.5 million of the company's stock less than two weeks
before the share price plunged abruptly last month, filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   The gambling-services company's chairman, president, vice
chairman, a director and vice president of marketing sold
405,300 shares May 31 and June 1, according to the filings.
The stock, which represented between 5% and 20% of their
holdings, fetched an average of $6.12 a share.

   On June 13, the New York Daily News reported that Rep.
Bart Gordon (D.,Tenn.) was calling for a federal
investigation of the telephone-games business, which Players
had entered earlier in the month with a version of the
"Jeopardy" TV game show. According to the report, Rep. Gordon
said phone games might constitute gambling.
   Players stock, which had risen to a 52-week high of $8.50
a share after the company began test-marketing the game June
4, fell 28% in the two days following the report. It closed
yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $5.25, off 25 cents.
   Players Vice Chairman David Fishman, who sold 86,400
shares, said that the insiders sold their shares before
starting "Jeopardy" so that "no one could question our
intentions." As for the later stock drop, he asks, "How would
we know it was going to happen?"
   Four of the insiders at the Calabasas, Calif., company
also filed with the SEC on May 31 their intention to sell
more than a million additional shares "as soon as possible."
But Mr. Fishman said the filings were made in error, and that
there aren't any plans to sell any more stock.
   A spokesman for Rep. Gordon said the congressman wrote to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh requesting an investigation
and that, late last week, the attorney general's office
responded that the matter has been referred to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
   Players' Mr. Fishman said its telephone "Jeopardy" game
"is well within the {Federal Communications Commission}
guidelines of not being gambling" because of the way it is
structured, and because it involves skill, not chance.
   To play the "Jeopardy" game, contestants call a 900-number
and answer 11 increasingly more difficult questions by
spelling out the first two letters of the answer on a
Touch-Tone phone. The game costs about $1 per minute to play
and offers a monthly grand prize of $10,000; there are also
smaller daily prizes.
   The game is a new business for Players International. The
company gets most of its revenue from its Players Club, which
offers members discounts on casino hotel rooms, meals and
shows.

   CAPITOL GAINS: Former President Gerald R. Ford sold a
third of his holdings in Nova Pharmaceutical Corp. last
month, SEC filings show. Mr. Ford, who serves as a director
of the Baltimore-based drug-research concern, received
$20,650, or $4.13 a share, for the 5,000 shares.
   Mr. Ford said he sold the stock "purely, totally for
income-tax-paying purposes." The former president said he
acquired the Nova shares through the exercise of options at a
price above the stock's current share price, creating "a
tax-loss benefit" upon their sale. He said he can use that
benefit to offset capital gains earned so far this year in
other transactions.
   "I'm keeping 10,000 {Nova} shares because I have great
faith in the company," Mr. Ford added.
   Separately, SEC filings also show that Nova
Pharmaceutical's president, Hans Mueller, bought 1,500 of its
shares on the open market, at an average price of $3.94 a
share, May 24 and May 25. The purchases increased his total
holdings 4%. He was in Europe and couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Nova closed at
$4.125, off 12.5 cents.

   CANADIAN MILLIONAIRE: In the largest insider sale reported
to the SEC last week, Michael G. Degroote, a director of
Canadian Pacific Ltd., sold 134.3 million Canadian dollars
(US$115.6 million) of its stock on June 21. He received C$22
(US$18.93) a share, the filings show. Canadian Pacific is a
Montreal-based holding company for a variety of
transportation, oil and gas, forestry and real estate
businesses.
   Mr. Degroote, who is chairman and chief executive officer
of another Canadian concern, Laidlaw Inc., sold 6,104,167 of
the shares he held indirectly in Canadian Pacific and kept
2,000 shares, according to SEC filings. Mr. Degroote acquired
the shares in 1988 when he sold a controlling interest in
Laidlaw to Canadian Pacific. He couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Canadian Pacific
shares closed yesterday at $17.75, up 25 cents.

   SMALL CHANGE: Henry W. Bloch, chairman of H &amp; R Block
Inc., received $3 million for just 2% of his stake in the
Kansas City, Mo.-based tax-preparation and business-services
company. He sold 76,000 shares at an average price of $39.53
a share in sales June 21 and June 22, SEC filings show. Mr.
Bloch declined to comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, H &amp; R Block shares
finished at $41.50, off 87.5 cents.
