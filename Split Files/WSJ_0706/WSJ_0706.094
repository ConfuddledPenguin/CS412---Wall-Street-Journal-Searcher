   NEW YORK -- The dollar strengthened against other major
currencies yesterday as dealers moved to correct, and profit
from, what many considered an excessive recent decline by the
U.S. currency.
   Many U.S. foreign exchange dealers took the day off,
apparently stretching Wednesday's Independence Day holiday
into a long weekend. Those who were active here and in other
markets around the world seemed to be concentrating on
establishing positions ahead of today's June U.S. employment
report.

   "A lot of traders came in looking for a lower dollar"
after the currency's retreat in Asian and European trading
Wednesday, said Thomas Palladino, a New York assistant vice
president for Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.
   "There seemed to be an incentive to push the dollar
lower," Mr. Palladino said, but the move didn't get the
support it needed. "Finally people decided {to say} to heck
with it, square up and wait for employment to come out."
   Michael McGuinness, a foreign currency investment officer
with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago, attributed the
lack of strong selling to a "feeling that most things have
been overdone" on the dollar's downside, especially what he
called the currency's "skyrocketing decline" against the
British pound.
   "The market was oversold," said Manfred Totzauer, senior
trader for Citibank in Frankfurt, explaining the dollar's
rise in European trading yesterday. If the U.S. report today
on non-farm payroll growth is much better than expected, he
said, "short-covering could take us two pfennigs higher"
against the mark.
   Although the dollar stood higher in late New York trading
yesterday than it was a day earlier in London, it was only
mixed by comparison with its pre-holiday New York levels. The
dollar was quoted at 1.6517 marks, up from 1.6505 late
Tuesday in New York and from 1.6467 marks late Wednesday in
London. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 150.60
yen, which was down from 150.90 in New York before the
holiday but up from 149.75 in London late Wednesday.
   Sterling was trading at $1.7815, up from $1.7775 in New
York Tuesday but down from $1.7845 in London Wednesday.
   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 151 yen
soon after the opening, unchanged from Thursday's Tokyo
close. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6553
marks, up a bit from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6551 marks.
   The employment report, due for release at the start of the
New York trading day, will contain the first official U.S.
economic data for June. Market anticipation of easier U.S.
credit has grown in recent weeks. Currency dealers will
scrutinize the data for signs of a U.S. slowdown because they
assume that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
will do the same.
   Non-farm payrolls are believed to have grown by 83,000 in
June, or by 132,000 if layoffs of temporary census workers
are excluded, according to the average of estimates of 20
economists.
   This would follow a gain of 164,000 in May, which included
the hiring of about 145,000 temporary census workers.
   Notwithstanding the market's recent run of thin,
directionless sessions, today "is going to be a wild day,"
said Brian Jones, an economist with Salomon Brothers in New
York. "You're going to get hit with a barrage of numbers," he
said. "Unless they're all going in one direction, you're
going to get bounced around until people have digested the
information."
   Mr. Jones said the often-overlooked hourly wage component
of the employment data may give the Fed a signal on interest
rates that contradicts the one contained in the employment
data. Analysts look for an average gain in hourly earnings of
0.3%, compared with a 0.4% gain in May.
   The dollar finished higher in Tokyo trading Thursday.
Japanese dealers suggested that the market had sold the
dollar too short Wednesday and observed that life insurance
companies entered the market Thursday, buying the dollar
around 150 yen. Other participants followed, but the dollar
subsided after it failed to break resistance about 151 yen.
   A report in the Financial Times newspaper that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev had been warned by a group of
"prominent politicians, scientists and army officers" of a
possible military coup also helped the dollar gain against
the mark in Tokyo, traders said.
   The most active cross, or non-dollar, trading was between
the pound and the mark. Long, or overbought, pound positions
were unwound against the German currency after the pound
reached about 2.95 marks in early European trading. Sterling
ended the New York session at 2.9425 marks, compared with
2.9385 marks late Wednesday in London.
   London traders still expect sterling to test an area
between 2.98 and 3.00 marks. They also see a chance for the
pound to move toward $1.80 in the next few weeks on
speculation about Britain's possible full entry into the
European Monetary System.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $361.40 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In early Hong Kong trading Friday, gold was quoted at
$360.60 an ounce.
