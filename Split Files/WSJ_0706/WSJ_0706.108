   SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Five members of a dissident
shareholder group have been elected to two separate boards of
companies that own and operate the Bay Meadows race track.
   The California Jockey Club elected Marilyn K. Gunderson
and Richard E. Perrazo as board members. Bay Meadows
Operating Co. named Grant G. Gunderson, Doris L. Johnson, and
Louis J. Poletti to its board. Both boards have six members.

   The dissidents replace a slate of management-appointed
directors, but didn't win enough seats in a May election to
control either of the boards. The shareholder group, which
holds a stake in California Jockey Club, has complained that
the companies placed too much emphasis on real estate
operations at the expense of running the race track.
   A spokesman for California Jockey said that the new
directors hadn't yet made any demands of management. The
California Jockey Club is one of three publicly traded real
estate investment trusts whose primary asset is a horse track
here; Bay Meadows Operating is a publicly traded concern that
oversees track operations.
