   TAIPEI -- Taiwan's trade surplus during the first half of
1990 totaled $4.94 billion, a 20% decline from the same
period last year, the government announced Thursday.
   But the monthly surplus for June was $1.09 billion, up 23%
from a year ago, said the directorate general of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.

   Exports in the first six months this year totaled $31.87
billion, down 0.8% from the first half of 1989. Imports
totaled $26.93 billion during the first half of 1990, an
increase of 3.9%, the agency said.
   Officials attributed the reduced trade surplus to lower
exports. Higher wages and production costs have weakened
Taiwan's competitiveness in foreign markets.
   Taiwan's surplus with the U.S., its largest trading
partner, totaled $4.04 billion in the first half of 1990,
down 27% from the same period a year earlier.
   Taiwan registered a surplus of $800 million with the U.S.
in June, down 17.1% from June 1989.
   Taiwan's exports to the U.S. totaled $1.72 billion in
June, while imports totaled $920 million.
   Taiwan's trade with Japan, its second largest trading
partner, registered a deficit of $3.71 billion in the first
half this year, rising 15.5% from period a year ago.
   The June deficit with Japan was $710 million in June, up
6.1% from the June 1989.
   The government has projected a 1990 trade surplus of $11
billion, compared with the $13.93 billion surplus last year.
