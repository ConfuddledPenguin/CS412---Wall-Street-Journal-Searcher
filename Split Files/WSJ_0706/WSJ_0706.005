   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West German production of raw
steel in the first half fell 6.7% to 19.38 million metric
tons, compared with a year earlier, the Federal Statistics
Office said. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   First-half output of raw iron declined 8.2% to 15.28
million metric tons.

   In June, the country produced slightly more than three
million metric tons of raw steel, down 12% from a year
earlier, and smelters made 9.8% less raw iron at 2.4 million
tons.
   Steel and iron production in West Germany has been soft
this year, in part because end users in some sectors
stockpiled supplies last year.
