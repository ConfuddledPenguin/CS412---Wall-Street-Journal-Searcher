   FORT WORTH, Texas -- You won't find its fashions on the
racks of Bloomingdale's or Saks Fifth Avenue, but Vera Lee
Garment Co. makes clothes you'd just die to wear.
   Literally.

   Founded in 1932, Vera Lee is one of the nation's oldest
producers of what it tactfully calls "premade funeral
fashions." In other words, clothes for dead people.
   Operating out of a small yellow building in a residential
neighborhood here, the company makes about 125 styles of
burial apparel, ranging from frilly nightgowns and dresses
($37 to $100 wholesale) to sober business suits ($75 to $80).
   And despite the gloom hanging over parts of the fashion
industry this season, business for Vera Lee is, well, lively.
   In 1989, the company sold about 400 dresses a week,
racking up total sales of about $1 million for the year.
Profit rose, says a Vera Lee accountant, although he wouldn't
elaborate. And owner Kathye Kellow says the company intends
to expand into new areas of the country this year and add
five or six salespeople.
   Why would anybody buy a Vera Lee original for a loved
one's eternal rest, instead of, say, a favorite old dress or
suit? Most people are buried in their own clothes, says Ms.
Kellow, but others have been in nursing homes for years and
don't have any dress-up clothes left. Buying a new outfit
also saves family members from a painful search through the
deceased's closet, she adds.
   Good marketing helps, too. Some funeral homes display Vera
Lee styles side by side with matching caskets. "A lot of
times a family will just walk up and see a dress and say,
`That's mom,'" says Ms. Kellow.
   For obvious reasons, this branch of the apparel industry
operates with its own set of rules. Fashion, for example,
takes a back seat to practicality. Suit pockets and zippers
are fake, and waists are elastic so that one size fits most.
Dresses are fitted with Velcro fastenings down the back.
   Pastels and lighter colors are recommended for women, Ms.
Kellow adds. Men are generally attired in conservative navy
or brown suits, available with or without pin stripes.
   "In the '70s, we made a leisure burial suit because
leisure suits were so cool back then," Ms. Kellow recalls.
"But we can't get too fashion conscious because they're out
the next year."
   Not that anybody would notice.
