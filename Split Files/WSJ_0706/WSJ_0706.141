   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is pushing a
broad-based new tax on energy as a way to help close the
budget gap, according to administration and congressional
officials.
   The tax, known as a BTU tax (for British thermal unit, the
measure of energy), would apply to various sources of energy,
including gasoline, oil, natural gas and nuclear and
hydroelectric power. On gasoline, the proposal being
discussed would amount to an increase of five or six cents a
gallon.

   If adopted by the budget summit, the proposal would
probably be the single largest revenue-raiser in the
deficit-cutting package, bringing in an estimated $20 billion
a year.
   Some Democrats are resisting the energy excise tax, saying
it is "regressive" -- that it falls more heavily on
low-income taxpayers than on high-income taxpayers. But
administration officials have been arguing that the tax isn't
so regressive. They say the tax would fall in roughly equal
proportion to income for most taxpayers, except for the very
poor and the very wealthy.
   Moreover, the BTU tax has political advantages over a
straight increase in the gasoline tax, in that it would
spread the burden more broadly over various energy users. The
federal gasoline tax is currently 9.1 cents a gallon.
   The BTU tax is included in a budget proposal that Sen.
Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) has drafted and plans to offer in
the coming weeks. Sen. Domenici is an ally of the Bush
administration, and works with it closely on budget matters.
   The budget negotiators are still far from agreement, and
various tax proposals are certain to rise and fall before a
final deal is cut. But for the moment, the BTU tax seems to
be near the top of the administration's agenda and has
supporters in Congress as well.
   In addition to an energy tax, the administration has made
it clear it wants any tax package to include a cut in the
capital-gains tax rate. And Democrats are certain to demand
some new tax on high-income Americans to offset the effects
of a capital-gains cut, which many Democrats believe is a
giveaway to the rich.
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the
administration is considering a tax on the sale of securities
as one way to hit high-income taxpayers. Congressional
officials say the proposal would probably put the tax in the
neighborhood of 15 cents per $100 of traded securities.
   Asked about the securities tax at a briefing for financial
reporters yesterday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said
only that tax-revenue plans are subject to negotiations with
Congress. "I'm not going to comment on any of the individual
taxes or lack of taxes or any part of the negotiations," Mr.
Brady said.
   The Bush administration's interest in the BTU tax is said
to be tied to the president's desire to help the environment.
A tax on the consumption of energy would discourage its
excessive use and help the environment.
   Many congressional Democrats support the tax for the same
reason. For example, Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), a senior
member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
currently is working on a bill that would impose a
broad-based energy tax, such as a BTU tax, as a
pro-environment proposal.
   What's more, a BTU tax might be more readily accepted by
the powerful lobbying groups that vehemently oppose more
targeted energy taxes, such as an increased tax on gasoline.
"We are not in favor of any tax increase at this point," said
Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the American Trucking
Associations. "But our view is, the broader the tax is spread
the better."
