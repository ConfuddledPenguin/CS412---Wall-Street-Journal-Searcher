   The NATO summit now meeting in London has been described
as the organization's most important gathering in 40 years.
Perhaps. The remaking of the political and economic map of
the West is indeed a daunting task. But on the basis of what
has been reported out of the summit so far, the one thing
we'd say doesn't need much changing or fixing is NATO itself.
As a political organization, it appears to be working quite
well.
   It may not seem like much to say that a political grouping
is running smoothly until you look around at the other
systems, many in the West, that seem to be forever wasting
their energies on marginal political obsessions. NATO has
indeed kept the peace for 40 years, which suggests that
somehow it has avoided fatal mistakes and found its way to
important and sustainable policies, such as summoning the
courage and will to deploy the Pershing missiles at a
critical point in the Cold War.

   So far, the participants at the current NATO summit are
behaving in a level-headed manner -- avoiding the more
credulous instincts of some analysts and even combining to
resist the more utopian impulses of individual members.
   Consider, for instance, that the big news out of
yesterday's session was President Bush's proposal to invite
Mikhail Gorbachev to address the North Atlantic Council in
Brussels. This idea seems in keeping with the apparently "de
rigueur" public-relations component of international
relations today. NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner of
West Germany, a clear-eyed hawk on military matters, had
opened the session by calling on the alliance to extend a
hand of friendship to the East. If Mr. Bush's invitation
meant that the NATO leadership actually wanted to clasp the
Soviet Union to its collective security breast, that would be
cause for worry. But, as Helmut Kohl discovered, NATO still
is able to separate matters of substance from symbolic
gestures.
   Mr. Kohl wanted a joint non-aggression declaration with
the Warsaw Pact countries that "we no longer regard one
another as adversaries." French President Francois
Mitterrand, with U.S. support, allowed as how this was not an
idea whose time had come. In the quaint but clear diplomatic
phrase of a Canadian official, Mr. Kohl's proposal was
"losing speed." Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's flamboyant notion that
NATO should alter its policy to say it would use nuclear
weapons only as a "last resort" drew a mixed response at
best.
   Or take the hot question of extending financial credits or
direct aid to the Soviets. Mr. Gorbachev went so far
yesterday as to send the summit meeting a message, appealing
for Western aid, and the Germans and French are pressing the
allies to do exactly that. But the U.S., Britain and Japan
have countered that any big aid package would be wasted now,
a view that surely comports with the reality of Soviet
economic disarray.
   Two days ago, Secretary of State Jim Baker had told a
meeting of Western aid donors that Soviet support for
satellites such as Cuba and its continued high rates of
military spending were impediments to aid. Meanwhile Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney noted in Oslo Wednesday that Norwegian
intelligence had picked up the Soviet transfer of 40 MiG-27
fighter bombers from Hungary to the Soviet Northern Fleet on
the Arctic Kola Peninsula, suggesting a continued Soviet
interest in NATO's strategically important flanks to the
north and south.
   All of this suggests to us that notwithstanding the
euphoria over communism's fall, there are still people inside
the NATO alliance who are keeping an eye on the ball. The
Cold War may be "over," but Yogi Berra's central insight was
never truer: It isn't over till it's over. Remember, 480,000
Soviet troops remain on German soil.
   The great unwinding of Soviet communism has just begun.
But reports out of the Soviet Party Congress suggest just how
tightly the Communist Party, no matter how bankrupt, is
coiled around that nation's life.
   The world is changing. NATO is changing. However, it is
far too early for the NATO alliance, as some are suggesting,
to radically alter its purpose or its membership. The deep
seriousness of NATO's reason for being -- the continued peace
and security of the West -- has through its complex
interdependencies managed to keep bad ideas to a minimum
while the alliance's core mission remained strong. In a time
of transition, it would be no small thing to have NATO's
sturdy presence intact.
