   Centaur Partners, New York, has gained an edge in its
proxy fight to win control of National Intergroup Inc. of
Pittsburgh. Centaur said Delaware Chancery Court ruled that a
National Intergroup amendment to its shareholder rights plan
was not valid because it was adopted without shareholder
approval.
   National Intergroup, an oil transportation and aluminum
and steel fabrication concern, said it plans to appeal the
chancery court ruling.

   Under the Jan. 26, 1990, amendment, National Intergroup's
"poison pill" would take effect if any single shareholder
acquired more than 10% of its common stock. A poison pill is
a tactic designed to make hostile takeovers prohibitively
expensive.
   The poison pill, which granted purchase rights to other
shareholders, previously took effect only after a shareholder
acquired 20% or more of the company.
   Centaur currently holds 16.5% of National Intergroup's
21.8 million shares outstanding.
