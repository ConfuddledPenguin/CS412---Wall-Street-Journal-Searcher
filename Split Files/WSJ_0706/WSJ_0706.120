   BOSTON (AP) -- A conference committee of the Massachusetts
Senate and House approved an increased income tax and a sales
tax on some services to help reduce the state budget deficit
estimated at about $1 billion.
   The proposed tax increases still must be approved by both
the House and Senate.

   The 5% sales tax on services -- opposed strongly by
various business groups -- was modified by the conference
committee. It would apply to fees charged by lawyers,
architects, engineers and accountants, and to commercial
electric and gas use, telecommunications, credit-reporting
services and graphic design, among others.
   The sales tax wouldn't apply until a threshold of $20,000
a year in fees per customer was reached.
   Under the plan endorsed by the conference committee, the
income tax, now 5.75%, would rise retroactively to 5.95%
initially then would rise to 6.25% for the fiscal year that
began July 1, and then would drop back to 5.95% in 1992.
   Even with the tax increases, legislators estimated that
the state still will have to cut spending to balance its
$13.6 billion budget. Massachusetts has the lowest general
obligation bond rating in the nation because of its financial
problems.
