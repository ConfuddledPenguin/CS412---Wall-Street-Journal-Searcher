   TOKYO -- A major trading company and a leading supermarket
chain have jointly launched Japan's latest entrant in the
race to produce films and television programming.
   C. Itoh &amp; Co., one of Japan's largest trading houses, and
Seiyu Ltd., a member of the Saison retailing and hotel group,
announced the establishment of Media International Corp.
Takao Yoshiki, president of the new venture, said the
Tokyo-based concern intends to co-produce television
programming with foreign companies, to invest in film
productions, to supply news from Japan and other Asian
nations to foreign broadcasters, and to buy and sell
audio-visual software.

   With Japan's fledgling cable-television and
direct-satellite broadcasting networks expected to
proliferate in the next few years, there is widespread talk
here of an impending shortage of "software," or television
programs. So a variety of companies are hoping to fill the
void.
   American cable networks such as Turner Broadcasting System
Co.'s Cable News Network and ESPN Inc. are supplying
programming to the nascent market. Moreover, a number of
Japanese companies have moved into the film-production
business, with Sony Corp.'s $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc. the most prominent example.
   Media International said that its aim is to help supply
"high quality software" internationally by acting as a
"software comprehensive trading company."
   Exactly what that means won't be clear for at least a few
months. Initially, Media International will be merely a
pre-operational planning organization with capital of 550
million yen, or about $3.7 million. C. Itoh and Seiyu each is
supplying 45.5% of that total, with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and
Sumitomo Bank, two of the world's biggest banks, each
providing 4.5%. Actual operations are expected to begin in
November.
   Mr. Yoshiki, previously vice president of NHK Enterprises,
a subsidiary of Japan's public broadcasting network, said in
an interview that Media International expects to increase its
capital to about $30 million and hopes to achieve revenue of
about $200 million in its first year. The new company said it
plans eventually to draw in about 40 corporate participants
from a cross-section of Japanese industry.
   While a mammoth trading company and a supermarket chain
would seem unlikely candidates for the entertainment
business, both C. Itoh and Seiyu already have footholds in
the industry. Seiyu has produced several film adaptations of
Japanese literary works, and C. Itoh, one of several trading
companies pursuing this new line of business, recently joined
with ESPN to launch a cable television sports network in
Japan.
   While NHK Enterprises developed the idea for Media
International, NHK won't have a direct equity participation
in the new company, Mr. Yoshiki said. NHK will, however,
stand to benefit by procuring programming for its two
direct-broadcast satellite stations and for its traditional
television and radio networks.
