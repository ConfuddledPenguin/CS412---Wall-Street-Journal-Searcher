   HOLLYWOOD -- Judging by early box office returns from the
July Fourth holiday, News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox film
"Die Hard 2: Die Harder" looks like it has a chance this
coming weekend to produce the top-grossing opening week of
any summer movie.
   On 2,378 screens Wednesday -- a day when fireworks
displays and holiday barbecues competed for audiences -- the
film grossed $5.9 million. In Tuesday night special
screenings on 1,800 screens across the country -- with some
theaters featuring one show, others two -- the movie grossed
$3,692,833; these totals, however, won't be included in the
five-day "weekend gross" figures released Monday.

   These figures could make "Die Harder" competitive with the
top opener of the summer so far, Carolco Pictures Inc.'s
"Total Recall," which grossed more than $35 million in its
first week.
   "Die Harder," co-produced by action-movie mogul Joel
Silver, is estimated to have cost a whopping $62 million just
to make, plus an additional $30 million to market and place
into theaters. The original "Die Hard," also starring Bruce
Willis, grossed $85 million in 1988.
   Putting this sequel into production was one of the first
official acts by new Fox film Chairman Joe Roth when he
assumed his current post less than a year ago. The studio has
lagged behind most other major studios in the past few movie
seasons.
