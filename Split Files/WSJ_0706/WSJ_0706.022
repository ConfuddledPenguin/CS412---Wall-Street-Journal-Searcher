   BRUSSELS -- For those Europeans who can't tell from the
weather that summer is here, there is another clue:
air-traffic controller strikes.
   French controllers in the air-traffic center that handles
the Paris region ended a three-day walkout. Air France had to
cancel 60% of its short-range and medium-range flights, and
domestic carrier Air Inter canceled two out of three of its
scheduled flights. Foreign airlines flying to Paris also
trimmed or canceled their schedules. Yesterday, Air France's
ground personnel announced a 36-hour strike beginning today.

   Last week, Belgian controllers halted all airline
operations at Brussels Airport for a day until they won a 24%
pay increase over two years. Rome controllers threatened a
work stoppage before the World Cup soccer match began in
June, but then backed off after a plea from the transport
minister. Swedish controllers staged work-to-rule actions in
May, causing chaotic delays at Stockholm airport and
throughout the country.
   No one, not even the International Federation of Air
Traffic Controllers Associations, knows where the next
European strike will occur. "I don't think any air-traffic
control organization plans on having an industrial dispute,"
says Preben Falkman-Lauridsen, a Danish controller who is
IFATCA's executive vice president for Europe. "But when
negotiations with the administration go poorly, that's when
there's a strike."
   Strikes cost travelers untold delays and reroutings.
Sabena, Belgian's flag carrier, tried to operate some of its
long-haul flights out of Luxembourg and Duesseldorf during
the one-day strike at Brussels last week. Incoming traffic
was rerouted to Amsterdam and Luxembourg. But that meant
three-hour rail or bus journeys for passengers whose flights
did operate.
   Such actions also cost airlines millions of dollars.
Sabena says it doesn't have a price tag yet for last week's
action. But the annual reports of many European airlines
contain evidence of the costliness of a controllers' strike,
or indeed, any action by pilots, mechanics, flight attendants
or others that slows or halts flight operations -- even in
another country.
   Unfortunately, such industrial actions appear endemic in
Europe. Certainly, those on the receiving end seem to be
resigned. "It's the usual summer obstructions," one airport
official says of the recent disturbances.
   "It's the normal amount," says a spokesman for
Eurocontrol, a Pan-European air-traffic planning agency.
"It's not that bad compared with last year."
   Adds Marcel Pisters, deputy secretary-general of the
Association of European Airlines: "These are sporadic things.
It's a reflection of the overall air-traffic control setup in
Europe." Controllers, he adds, "are civil servants. And in a
number of countries, their financial conditions aren't the
best you can think of."
   The French stoppage affected the country's main northern
air-traffic center at Athis-Mons. Controllers are asking pay
and staff increases to cope with what they say is a mounting
workload caused by the boom in air travel. Strikers are
demanding bonuses of 3,000 French francs ($540) to FFr5,000 a
month to supplement their current average monthly salary of
FFr16,000.
   But the complaints aren't always about money. "These
disputes seem to flare up very quickly," says a spokesman for
the International Transport Workers Federation, over issues
such as manning levels, shifts, overtime work, reduced
holiday periods and poor equipment. And their grievances "are
pretty well justified," says one labor specialist.
   The roots of the problem can be traced back to the early
1980s. Then, Europe plunged into recession, air-traffic fell
and governments quit recruiting controllers and took money
earmarked for air-traffic equipment and put it into roads,
hospitals, schools and other worthy state projects.
   So when economies improved and air travel unexpectedly
boomed in the mid-1980s, governments were doubly
ill-prepared. By some estimates, Europe needs 1,500 to 2,000
more qualified controllers than it has today, mostly due to
double-digit traffic increases in the past few years. But
with the moderate-to-low salaries offered, it isn't easy to
recruit controllers. And it takes several years to train
them.
   Meanwhile, experts say, Europe's air-traffic system is
hopelessly inefficient. Western Europe has 22 national
systems running 42 air-traffic control centers. The centers
handle half the traffic 20 U.S. centers handle -- for twice
the price. Little effort is being made to standardize
purchasing of equipment, and the necessary technical upgrades
are slow in coming.
   This problem has gotten more attention in the past couple
of years of massive summertime air congestion and frequent
air-traffic control strikes. Governments are beginning to
budget more money for the field and are for the first time
talking to their neighbors about integrating their control
systems. But billions of dollars, lots of political will and
years are called for, especially as air traffic continues to
surge.
   Thus, the short-term outlook isn't bright. "You can make
controllers work a lot of overtime and lengthen their working
hours," says Mr. Falkman-Lauridsen of IFATCA, "or they can
handle reduced traffic." In other words, the choice is
between strikes and delays.
