   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its
ratings on MNC Financial Inc. securities of about $2.1
billion, including a preferred stock issue that S&amp;P gave a
rating below investment grade.
   The rating agency lowered its rating on the preferred
stock to double-B-plus from triple-B-plus. Ratings on senior
debt were lowered to triple-B from single-A-minus and on
subordinated debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus.

   Also lowered to triple-B-plus/A-2 from single-A/A-1 were
ratings on certificates of deposit and letter of
credit-backed issues by units Maryland National Bank,
American Security Bank and MBNA America.
   Ratings for commercial paper of MNC Financial and unit
American Security Corp. were affirmed at A-2.
   S&amp;P said the downgrades reflect "continued weakness in
MNC's real estate markets and its significant concentration
in construction and commercial real estate loans."
   A spokesman at MNC, a financial services company based in
Baltimore, declined to comment.
