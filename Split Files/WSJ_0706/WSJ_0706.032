   HONG KONG -- Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong fell 6.3% to
499,816 in May from 533,692 a year earlier, when the
ill-fated pro-democracy movement in Beijing started to hurt
local tourism, the Hong Kong Tourist Association said.
   In this year's first five months, visitor arrivals fell
2.2% to 2,359,000 from 2,412,000 a year earlier.
