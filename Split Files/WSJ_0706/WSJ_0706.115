   Sony Corp. of Japan plans to increase purchases of
European-made semiconductors, in line with its target to
boost the ratio of foreign-made chips in its products to 20%
by July 1991, a spokesman said.
   Japanese consumer electronics makers have been increasing
their foreign chip purchases, in efforts to meet the target
set in a five-year agreement between the U.S. and Japan to
raise the overall share of foreign chips sold in Japan to 20%
of the market.

   The exact nature of the agreement, which ends in July
1991, is a matter of dispute, with the U.S. claiming that
Japan pledged to meet the 20% goal and Japan saying it only
promised to make efforts to reach the target.
   The proportion of foreign-made chips purchased in June by
Sony was between 15% and 16% of its total chip needs, most of
which were U.S.-made, the spokesman said.
