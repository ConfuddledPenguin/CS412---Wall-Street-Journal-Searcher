   Oil prices tumbled as wildcat strikes in Norway's offshore
oil fields began to fizzle.
   Expectations that strikers would continue to defy a
back-to-work order from their union and the Norwegian
government faded as strike activity in the huge Ekofisk oil
field came to an end. Reports that there were still pockets
of resistance at other installations, however, prompted a
brief rally shortly before trading ended.

   Crude oil for August delivery slipped 30 cents to $16.50 a
barrel in light trading, with many market participants taking
an extended holiday after Wednesday's Independence Day
closing.
   Heating oil and gasoline prices also were lower as weekly
statistics showed that refineries are beginning to increase
their output of petroleum products.
   If the Norwegian strikes end, it will be up to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up the
price of oil. There are indications that Kuwait, which is
demanding a higher quota despite a global oil glut, might
relax its stance until the price for the OPEC basket of
crudes approaches the cartel's goal of $18 a barrel. It
currently stands at only slightly more than $14 a barrel.
   There also were reports that OPEC leaders might be trying
to define a strategy that would accommodate Kuwait's desire
to produce more than its current daily quota of 1.5 million
barrels.
   The oil ministers of Kuwait and Indonesia ended two days
of meetings with acting OPEC President Sadek Boussena in
Algiers yesterday. Mr. Boussena has been appealing to OPEC
leaders to put aside their individual needs until higher
prices are re-established.
   If he has persuaded the Kuwaitis to be more flexible, "it
would be a surprising switch in policy possibly meaning more
harmony within the cartel and maybe higher oil prices," said
Nauman Barakat, first vice president for international energy
futures at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In one bearish development, however, the International
Energy Agency reported that OPEC pumped 23.2 million barrels
a day in June. And there is little likelihood that production
will decline much below 23 million barrels a day even if the
cartel, at its July 25 meeting, reaffirms its daily
production quota of 22 million barrels.
   However, demand for oil can be expected to rise in the
third and fourth quarters, which might make a production
level of 23 million barrels a day more acceptable, analysts
say.

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Forecasts of an end to a relatively
brief Midwest heat wave drove corn and soybean futures prices
lower. Temperatures approached 100 degrees Fahrenheit early
this week in Iowa and some surrounding states, but private
meteorologists are predicting cooler temperatures and rain
across much of the region. Corn for December delivery settled
at $2.805 a bushel, down its daily limit of 10 cents. An
initial price plunge triggered heavy selling by
trend-following commodity funds and other speculators, all
but ensuring that futures prices would remain depressed for
the rest of the session, analysts said. Richard Dennis, one
of the most active speculators in grain futures contracts on
the Chicago Board of Trade, was widely rumored by analysts to
have been the largest single seller of December corn futures.
As a matter of policy, the reclusive futures trader declines
to comment on his activity. Soybeans for July delivery
settled at $6.2850 a bushel, down 20 cents.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices swung wildly. The July contract ended three
cents a pound higher at 92.80 cents after trading as high as
93.90 cents. The October contract, which reflects both the
current crop and the next crop year, finished at 80.74 cents
a pound, up 0.69 cent, after reaching a high of 82.05 cents.
The December contract, reflecting new-crop conditions, traded
as high as 77 cents a pound but ended at 75.62 cents, down
0.16 cent. Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist at Merrill Lynch
Futures in New York, said the July contract, which expires
Monday and now has no limit on price moves, helped lift
new-crop prices to life-of-contract highs early in the
session. Just before the close, however, selling developed in
these contracts. "I think profit-taking hit the market," Mr.
Mueller said. The July open interest, or number of contracts
remaining to be nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled
by delivery of cotton, is well above 1,000, an unusually
large number this close to expiration, Mr. Mueller said.
However, he said, what little cotton there is around is going
into the higher-priced cash market and isn't being certified
for delivery against open futures contracts.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were driven higher by speculation
about a tightening of supplies. Copper for September delivery
reached a life-of-contract high of $1.1695 a pound before
settling at $1.1605, up 2.95 cents from Tuesday. The most
significant news seemed to be a report of an explosion at one
of Chile's Codelco mines, El Teniente. Codelco is the world's
biggest copper producer. There also were rumors of labor
problems in the copper mines in Chile. David Threlkeld,
president of Threlkeld &amp; Co., a Vermont-based international
metals dealer, said copper companies might produce 350,000
metric tons less this year than users will demand. "And there
isn't 350,000 tons in stocks to be drawn down," he said. A
metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. Mr. Threlkeld cautioned that
the demand estimate assumes there won't be a recession in the
U.S. He also said Codelco, which originally estimated its
production for the year at 1,290,000 metric tons, has reduced
that number by 100,000 tons. Mr. Threlkeld has estimated that
Codelco will produce only 1,050,000 metric tons. He also
estimates that the world used 120,000 metric tons more copper
in the first four months of the year than it produced.
