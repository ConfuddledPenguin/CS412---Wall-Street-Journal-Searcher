   LONDON -- The Western allies agreed in principle on steps
to revamp their defense strategy in light of the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe, as well as on a dramatic
symbolic gesture to show that they want to cooperate with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   In the first day of a two-day summit meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, the alliance generally accepted
a proposal by President Bush to declare that NATO will use
nuclear weapons only as a "last resort," U.S. officials said.
Britain and France voiced some misgivings about a change,
however, and language designed to address their concerns was
being drafted late last night.

   The allies also agreed to an American proposal to invite
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to address a NATO meeting,
officials said. The invitation is intended as a way of
illustrating that the alliance wants to enter a new era of
cooperation with its longtime adversaries in the Eastern
bloc. France initially questioned whether to invite Mr.
Gorbachev personally at this time, when he is working out
serious domestic political problems, but later accepted the
idea.
   In addition, the U.S. and West Germany appeared to have
worked out an agreement on the sensitive question of whether
to make a commitment now on how much to cut the size of the
army of a newly united Germany.
   Officials said the two sides worked out a compromise in
which a general pledge to cut the army will be included as an
appendage to a conventional arms treaty now being negotiated
with the Soviet Union in Vienna, while leaving details and
haggling over the precise size of the cut for a later,
follow-on conventional arms pact.
   The Soviet Union has sought a pledge of cuts in the German
army, and Bonn wanted to satisfy Moscow. But the U.S. feared
that trying to set a specific size for the new German army
now would unduly complicate completion of the almost
completed conventional arms pact.
   Final details of the agreements were being worked out late
last night by NATO foreign ministers, who had failed to
resolve all the snags in four hours of intense private talks
earlier in the day. More than anything else, the changes are
designed to illustrate to the Soviet Union that it has
nothing to fear from allowing a newly united Germany to
become a full member of the revamped NATO alliance.
   The foreign ministers are expected to resolve their
differences in time for the alliance to issue a communique
today containing outlines of a new NATO strategy and kicking
off a more detailed overhaul of alliance policies.
   As if to underscore the sensitivity of the NATO session,
Mr. Gorbachev sent the British government a letter on the eve
of the summit saying he would be watching the meeting closely
as he weighs his decisions on Germany. He also referred to
his country's need for Western aid, European officials said.
   Mr. Bush is trying to engineer changes in alliance policy
that go far enough to show that NATO is adjusting to
political realities, but not so far that they emasculate the
alliance, the most important vehicle for wielding U.S.
influence in Europe. To some extent, Mr. Bush has found
himself caught in the middle of the alliance, between allies
such as Germany, who want to move quickly in making changes,
and France and Britain, who have argued for more caution.
   The argument for caution was summarized by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who declared at the summit's
opening session: "The cornerstones of {NATO's} sure defense
must remain, for we do not know what the future holds, but
the architecture may change in the new situation."
   In addition to the other changes, Mr. Bush suggested that
NATO establish some kind of undefined "liaison" relationship
with nations of the Warsaw Pact. That step, combined with the
invitation to Mr. Gorbachev to visit NATO, would be designed
to "show that NATO has a new dimension of cooperation with
the Soviet Union and the new democracies of Eastern Europe,"
Mr. Bush told allied leaders. Some allies questioned how such
a liaison link would work, and details were being debated.
   Mr. Bush also declared that the U.S. is prepared to
withdraw its nuclear-tipped artillery shells from West
Germany. Making that offer amounted to making a virtue out of
necessity. The short-range shells have lost their military
usefulness now that East Germany and other countries
bordering the Western alliance have dumped their communist
systems and broken out of the Soviet orbit.
   But it remains unclear whether the U.S. and West Germany
have agreed on how quickly to pull out the artillery shells.
   Mr. Bush is proposing completing the pullout only after
the pending conventional arms-reduction pact with the Soviets
is completed and "Soviet-stationed forces in Europe have
returned home," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   West Germany would like to set a faster timetable. West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the summit that his
government hopes that all the artillery shells will be
eliminated as soon as the conventional agreement is signed
and the Soviets make some undefined gesture of "reciprocity."
   On the sensitive question of NATO's nuclear strategy, Mr.
Bush didn't propose ditching the alliance's policy of
"flexible response," which reserves the right to respond to
an overwhelming conventional attack by quickly turning to
short-range nuclear arms. Rather, Mr. Bush wants to refine
the policy by declaring that nuclear arms would be a "last
resort."
   British and French officials, though concerned that such a
change could raise questions about the entire future of
nuclear arms in Europe, expressed willingness to live with
that language provided it is coupled with a declaration that
NATO will continue to have a nuclear deterrent.
