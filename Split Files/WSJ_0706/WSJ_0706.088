   SALLY B. FRANK, the plaintiff in a case in which two
Princeton University eating clubs were ordered to admit
women, is an associate law professor at New York Law School.
An article in the Legal Beat column yesterday incorrectly
identified her as an associate professor at New York
University Law School.

ownership of the Savage River iron ore mines in Australia
would not have a "material effect" on the company's financial
position or operating results. An earlier edition misstated
the company's position.

Restructuring Accord Set by Pickands Mather &amp; Co." -- WSJ

   HIBERNIA SAVINGS BANK (LA.) was incorrectly included in
the "Index to Businesses" listing in yesterday's editions in
reference to an article about a second-quarter loss and a
decision to omit the quarterly dividend. The story referenced
involved Hibernia Savings Bank of Quincy, Mass., and not
Hibernia Corp., the New Orleans-based bank holding company.
