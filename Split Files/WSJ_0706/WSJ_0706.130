   The man at the helm of the $14 billion Fidelity Magellan
Fund now may be Morris Smith instead of the celebrated Peter
Lynch, but otherwise it's business as usual.
   Like Mr. Lynch before him, Mr. Smith is in almost
perpetual motion, visiting companies, grilling analysts and
buying stocks by the fistful. His biggest bet now: nonbank
financial stocks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Smith took over as manager of the country's largest
mutual fund on June 1. That was also the day his wife went
into labor. But Mr. Smith stuck it out at the office, working
a full day. "It was the fourth time around, so you get used
to it," said Mr. Smith, a 32-year-old graduate of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "If I'd had to
come home, she would have called me."
   On that occasion, Mr. Smith bet right. His wife didn't
give birth until the following day. But the real question for
Magellan's one million shareholders is, can Mr. Smith deliver
in the stock market?
   Fidelity Magellan is the country's largest fund, with the
best 10-year record. Mr. Smith, who until recently managed
the Fidelity OTC fund, has been at the Magellan helm for only
a month. Early returns show Magellan up 0.44% for June, vs.
0.16% for the average stock fund.
   "The most obvious change is that there are a lot fewer
names in the fund," said Mr. Smith. He has trimmed back
Magellan's holdings from 1,300 stocks when Mr. Lynch
announced his resignation at the end of March to 775 today.
"That appears to be a lot more significant than it is.
Peter's secret was not owning a lot of names. It was making
big bets on a few stocks."
   Mr. Smith is continuing this tradition. The fund's 50
largest holdings account for 38% of the fund's assets, and
the top 100 holdings amount to 52%.
   Mr. Smith's biggest current position is in nonbank
financial stocks, an area Mr. Lynch also was fond of. Mr.
Smith has retained, and in some cases added to, Magellan's
large positions in the Federal National Mortgage Association,
Student Loan Marketing Association, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. and financial services companies such as
Kemper Corp. and Primerica Corp.
   "Most of these stocks have very attractive fundamentals.
They have visible earnings, and they are at attractive
price/earnings ratios," said Mr. Smith. "They're being
tainted with the same brush as the bank stocks."
   Mr. Smith, for instance, thinks the earnings at Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, two entities that buy home loans and
repackage them as securities, will grow 12% to 15% annually
over the next few years. "I don't see many stocks with that
outlook which are trading at roughly eight times next year's
earnings," he said.
   Mr. Smith is also enamored of Kemper, the insurance and
money management firm. He reckons Kemper, which closed
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at
$41.25, up 25 cents, will earn between $5.50 and $6 a share
next year.
   When Mr. Lynch announced his resignation, Magellan had
hefty positions in Nestle S.A., Philip Morris Cos. and
Unilever PLC. Mr. Smith said he still owns the stocks, but he
has also built up big positions in his favorites such as
PepsiCo Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., both of which rank
among the fund's 10 largest holdings.
   "There's probably more of a weighting in technology than
there was before," said Mr. Smith, who has bought large
positions in companies including Compaq Computer Corp. and
Conner Peripherals Inc. "That's probably something I brought
with me from the OTC fund." Mr. Smith has also added to
stakes in some of his favorite over-the-counter companies,
such as the athletic-shoe maker Nike Inc. and the
long-distance telephone carrier MCI Communications Corp.
   With Mr. Lynch gone, the mutual fund manager with the best
10-year record is G. Kenneth Heebner, who has managed CGM
Capital Development and New England Growth since 1977. For
the past decade, the two funds rank as the third and fifth
best performers, respectively.
                                                                                                       

   Five-Year Leader
                                                                                                       

   Japan Fund                                   +288.67%
                                                                                                       

   Life has been a roller coaster lately for the Japan Fund,
a no-load mutual fund managed by New York's Scudder, Stevens
&amp; Clark.
   In this year's first quarter the $365 million fund was
pummeled for a 16.1% loss, as the Tokyo stock market tanked.
But in the most recent three months, the fund bounced back
16.27%, making it one of the second quarter's top performing
funds.
   "The {Japanese} market for small companies went up in the
first quarter, while the rest of the market was down," noted
the fund's 62-year-old manager, O. Robert Theurkauf. He said
the Japan Fund's performance was helped because small and
medium-sized companies account for more than 30% of its stock
portfolio: "That's the single most important factor that
explains this year's good performance."
   Rough times are nothing new to the Japan Fund. It used to
be a closed-end, or publicly traded, fund. But it came under
attack by corporate raiders and in 1987 converted to a
regular open-end mutual fund, issuing and redeeming shares to
meet investor demand. The fund also had a recent manager
change in February, when Mr. Theurkauf, who has worked at
Scudder for 40 years, took over leadership of the fund.
   But through it all, the fund has produced stellar results.
It ranks as the top fund over five years and the fourth best
for the past decade.
   Mr. Theurkauf isn't ready to make startling predictions
about the Tokyo stock market, but he does sound a note of
caution about the Japanese economy. "We think the underlying
inflation is very real, and this is manifesting itself in
higher interest rates," he said. "If you talk to brokers,
they'll say the market is going back to 40000. We doubt it."
Japan's Nikkei index of 225 stocks closed Thursday at
32351.67 points.
   For now, Mr. Theurkauf is placing his bets on large
noncyclical companies including such retailers as Autobacs
Seven Co., Aoyama Trading Co. and Ito-Yokado Co. He is also
hanging on to seemingly undervalued smaller companies such as
Asatsu Inc., an advertising agency, and Ines Corp., MKC Ltd.
and Nippon System Development Co., all of which produce
computer software.
                                                                                                       

   12-Month Leader
                                                                                                       

   Fidelity Select Biotechnology                + 56.36%
                                                                                                       

   For managers of Fidelity's 38 Select portfolios, which
each invest in a single industry, it sure helps to be in the
right place at the right time.
   Nobody knows that better than Michael Gordon, the
25-year-old manager of the $160 million Fidelity Select
Biotechnology. Propelled by a run-up in biotechnology stocks
that started in early 1989, the fund has the best 12-month
record of all mutual funds, with a total return of 56.36%.
   Mr. Gordon, who graduated three years ago from Tufts
University with a double major in classics and quantitative
economics, said biotech stocks have been boosted by a series
of successful product launches and by the proposed merger of
Genentech Inc. with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding
Ltd. Genentech, which closed on the Big Board at $29, up 50
cents, is Mr. Gordon's largest position.
   Under the $2.1 billion merger pact, which got the nod from
Genentech's shareholders in June but still needs approval
from the Federal Trade Commission, Roche Holding will buy 60%
of Genentech's stock. For every two Genentech shares, holders
will get $36 in cash plus one share of redeemable Genentech
common stock. Roche has the right to buy all of the
redeemable stock at various dates between December 1990 and
June 1995. The redemption price ranges from $38 a share for
the earliest redemption date to $60 if Roche waits until June
1995. "It's most attractive {for shareholders} if the
redeemable stock is redeemed this December," said Mr. Gordon,
based on the imputed rate of return of the various redemption
prices.
   The fund's second largest position is Amgen Inc., which
last year successfully introduced Epogen, a drug that
stimulates red blood cell production and can be used to treat
dialysis patients suffering from anemia. Mr. Gordon has his
eye on the company's next big product launch.
   "The company has a second product, called G-CSF, which
boosts bone marrow and thereby fights infections," said Mr.
Gordon, who expects the drug to be able to help cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy. He expects the product's
introduction to be approved in Europe and the U.S. within a
year. "Earnings should continue to grow at 35% to 50%
{annually} for a few years once this thing is launched."
   The fund has 70% of its assets in biotechnology research
companies such as Amgen and Genentech. But Mr. Gordon also
invests in some companies that supply the big research
outfits. The fund owns such stocks as Applied Biosystems
Inc., which makes machines for analyzing DNA, and Life
Technologies Inc., which supplies reagents to biotech
companies.
                                                                                                       

   Second-Quarter Leader
                                                                                                       

   Schield Progressive Environmental            + 29.54%
                                                                                                       

   "Ours is a fund you will truly feel good about," proclaims
the 100% recycled paper marketing brochure for the Schield
Progressive Environmental Fund.
   Schield's shareholders would no doubt agree. For the most
recent quarter, the fund ranks as the top performing mutual
fund, with a total return of 29.54%.
   "Twenty-five years ago, the environmental business was
garbage collection," said Glenn Cutler, the fund's
36-year-old manager. "Today, the environmental business as we
know it is in its infancy. We've littered the earth with the
residue of progress."
   The Schield fund, which was launched in February and has
assets of just $1.6 million, is hardly your typical mutual
fund. According to its prospectus, the fund invests in
"companies engaged in contributing to a cleaner and healthier
environment." But the fund's stock picks are also vetted to
make sure the companies are "socially responsible." And lest
investors have any further doubts about the fund's good
intentions, the fund's distributor also donates part of its
annual fee to charity.
   This fund isn't for the faint of heart. Schield
Progressive Environmental is a so-called nondiversified fund,
which means it can invest its assets in a relatively small
number of stocks. The fund currently owns just 14 stocks,
mostly smaller companies traded over-the-counter or on the
American Stock Exchange. Three stocks account for almost 34%
of the fund's assets, and some of the fund's holdings trade
at well over 20 times earnings.
   "You can't buy environmental stocks based on
{price/earnings} multiples," said Mr. Cutler. "You've got to
pick them up based on the niche they're in, the quality of
the management and their growth rate."
   The fund's largest position, at 16% of assets, is Sanifill
Inc., an operator of landfills in Georgia and Texas. "It's a
great cash generating business with prices moving in the
right direction," said Mr. Cutler, who reckons the company
will earn 50 cents to 60 cents a share this year. Sanifill
closed in American Stock Exchange composite trading at
$21.25, up 50 cents.
   Mr. Cutler also has a big stake in Martech USA Inc., which
is in the marine pollution control business. Martech played a
role in the Exxon Valdez oil cleanup. "Nobody wants to see
large oil spills, but there are spills every day," said Mr.
Cutler. "Most of them don't get reported in the news." He
expects Martech, which fell 25 cents in national
over-the-counter trading to $13.25, will earn 95 cents a
share for the year ending in August.
   Schield Progressive Environmental charges a 4.5% sales
commission on investments. The fund also has projected annual
expenses of 2.5%, well above the 1.5% average for stock
mutual funds.
