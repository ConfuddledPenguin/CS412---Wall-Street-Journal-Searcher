   TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan
climbed 25% to set a monthly record for June of 22,253 units
from 17,840 units a year earlier, the Japan Automobile
Importers' Association said.
   Statistics show sales of imported, foreign motor vehicles
topped year-earlier levels for the 78th month in a row.

   Sales for the first six months of this year set a record
of 113,622 units, representing a 40% gain from 81,318 units
in the first half of 1989.
   The association said booming personal consumption was
behind the strong gain, as Japan's economy continues to
expand for the 43rd month in a row.
   The strong increase from year-earlier levels was traced in
part to a Japanese consumption tax imposed in April, 1989,
which replaced a higher commodity tax. The price gap between
Japanese cars and imported cars also has narrowed as Japanese
auto makers have unveiled more expensive models.
   By country, in all imported vehicle categories, West
Germany was the source of 13,531 units, up 16% from 11,708
units. The trend of rising sales of West German cars since
the introduction of a consumption tax is not likely to
change, despite an average price rise of 3% for West German
models in the domestic market.
   Sales of all U.S.-made vehicles grew 28% in June to 2,898
units from 2,258 units. Sales of all British vehicles
registered a 67% upsurge to 2,230 units in June from 1,338
units.
   French car sales showed a 43% jump, totaling 1,520 units,
while Swedish sales registered a 29% increase to 1,305 units.
