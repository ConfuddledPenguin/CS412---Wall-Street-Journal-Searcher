   NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. said it agreed to sell its citric
acid business before the end of the year to
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a Decatur, Ill., processor of
soybean, wheat and corn products, including ethanol fuel.
   A spokesman for Pfizer, a health care and pharmaceuticals
concern, said it was too soon to discuss terms of the
transaction. Pfizer said the sale is expected to generate a
gain.
