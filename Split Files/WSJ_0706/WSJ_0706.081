   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Wayne A.
Davidson, president of the pharmaceutical and nutritional
group, will take on additional responsibilities to head the
company's world-wide pharmaceutical business.
   The new duties strengthen Mr. Davidson's position as a
candidate to succeed Richard L. Gelb as chief executive
officer and illustrate the continued consolidation of the
company under control of executives from Bristol Myers.
Bristol Myers Co. and Squibb Co. merged last year.

   Mr. Davidson, 58 years old, who came from Bristol Myers,
assumes responsibility for the Bristol-Myers Squibb
Pharmaceutical Research Institute, which previously was
overseen by Richard M. Furlaud, president of the company.
Moreover, Mr. Davidson, who had reported to Mr. Furlaud,
Squibb's chairman and chief executive officer before the
merger, now will report directly to Mr. Gelb, who previously
headed Bristol Myers.
   The changes are more evidence that the transaction
announced last July as a merger was actually Bristol Myers's
acquisition of Squibb. "At the top, it's Bristol, except for
the head of research and development," says Marc Mayer,
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. And the research
chief, Edgar Haber, reports to Mr. Davidson.
   Both Mr. Gelb, who is also chairman of the new company,
and Mr. Furlaud are expected to retire soon, analysts say.
"Now we have to say that Davidson is the person to watch,"
says Viren Mehta of Mehta &amp; Isaly, drug industry analysts.
   Mr. Furlaud remains as president and also was named as a
member of the Office of Chairman to work on strategic and
policy issues with Mr. Gelb, the company said.
   When the merger was announced, speculation about who would
succeed Messrs. Gelb and Furlaud focused on Mr. Davidson and
Jan Leschly, then president of Squibb and head of its
pharmaceutical operations. But Mr. Leschly, explaining that
he wasn't part of the acquiring company, resigned in October
and last month was named to head SmithKline Beecham PLC's
world-wide pharmaceutical business.
   Charles A. Heimbold Jr., executive vice president, and
another Bristol Myers official, heads the company's consumer
products business and is also considered a potential heir
apparent. Because the pharmaceutical business is regarded as
the company's biggest profit center, some analysts believe
Mr. Davidson, also an executive vice president, is in the
stronger position.
   The company said Mr. Davidson wasn't available for an
interview yesterday.

   BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB Co. said that responsibilities of
executive vice president Charles A. Heimbold Jr. include the
health care and medical products groups and corporate
strategic planning and development, as well as the consumer
products group. Mr. Heimbold's duties weren't fully described
in Friday's edition.
