   BUENOS AIRES -- There is at least one benefit to
Argentina's dramatic economic decline: The deterioration has
reached such an extreme level that all social sectors seem to
have come together to demand an immediate resolution,
focusing on privatization of an obsolete, statist economy.
While resistance to privatization efforts continues,
opposition groups retreat a bit more every day as they are
forced to come up with productive responses when faced with
an increasing public awareness of the urgent solutions
required.
   Much attention recently has focused on the privatization
of Argentina's byzantine state-owned telephone company. But
the privatization of the oil and gas sector -- lorded over by
the state oil monopoly YPF -- may be a better indicator of
the forces for change in Argentina as well as the resistance
that still has to be overcome.

   With other entities, privatization usually means little
more than the transfer of public assets to private hands. But
privatization in the oil and gas sector also can imply
substantial new investments that lead to expansion and
economic growth. For such projects there is an abundance of
international expertise available as well as substantial
investor interest, if the right conditions pertain. Hence
their significance as they clear the channels for an
investment flow that also can benefit other sectors of
Argentina's economy.
   Argentina is not a major oil producer, but it is blessed
with abundant reservoirs of both oil and gas, commercially
quite viable at current world price levels. Yet major areas
of its territory remain largely unexplored. The only way to
break the current cycle of stagnation in Argentina's
oil-and-gas-producing sector lies in the opening of those
resources to private capital investment, be it of national or
multinational origin. Therein lies the financial strength and
operational capability with which to develop those fields.
   This proposal is certainly not original. What is new is
the almost universal support it has garnered from public
opinion generally in Argentina.
   Thirty years ago, the Movement of Integration and
Development political party first suggested transforming half
a century of state monopoly of all oil and gas activity;
multinational oil companies were invited to share in the
production process. Such a break with nationalist tradition
brought on one of the nastiest political debates in Argentine
memory. The fiercest critics were the "Radicales" of the
Radical Civic Union (which elected President Raul Alfonsin in
1983) along with certain sectors of the "Peronista" Party to
which Argentina's President Carlos Menem belongs.
   Years went by and in 1984 President Alfonsin traveled to
the U.S to make an announcement -- at the Houston Petroleum
Club -- inviting foreign investors to participate in the
development of Argentina's oil and gas resources. Now
President Menem is embarked on a more ambitious effort to
open areas where the primary producing fields are currently
located to joint-venture participation with the private
sector. These have been YPF's exclusive preserve and will
require a high level of investment to maintain productivity
and develop new fields. These are also the areas that will
provide the quickest return on investment, if properly
managed.
   This project now faces delays and political challenges of
various sorts. These will be unimportant if the president's
determination holds steady, and if there is a clear
understanding that what is at stake is much more than who
will be the operator of this or that field.
   Perhaps the most notorious obstacles to privatizations
(though not the most difficult) are the conditionalities that
the oil workers union seeks to impose on the process. There
are strong and valid reasons behind their lobbying: The
specter of unemployment looms ever larger in Argentina's
recessionary environment.
   Public-opinion polls spell it out clearly. On the one hand
a majority of the population (80%) backs the privatization
drive. On the other, a high percentage wants it to happen
without affecting employment. This might not be a problem if
there were a prosperous economic environment offering
alternative job opportunities. Such not being the case,
privatization efforts demand a return to economic growth if
social upheaval is to be avoided.
   Another hurdle in the way of definitive oil and gas
privatization is the inconsistency between the positions of
various government officials. Territorial squabbles seem to
underlie these differences and undermine a resolute execution
of the project. This is especially so when ambiguities evoke
understandable but undesirable suspicions. There is only one
way to jump over this hurdle: political determination and
resoluteness at the highest level.
   If the overriding objective is that of promoting
investments and productive growth, there will be clear and
acceptable answers to each challenge that may appear. An
example of a critical subject that is part of this discussion
concerns who will be the operator of a field when there is a
joint-venture association with YPF. If greater efficiency is
desired, there is only one viable answer: the private-sector
oil company investor. Any other response would scare away
potential investors and/or defeat the objective of achieving
increased efficiency.
   Another source of opposition to genuine privatization is
the group of companies that has been accustomed to
comfortable positions as ensured suppliers to the state. The
whole area of public-sector purchases and contracts lacks the
agility and the controls that are normal in private-sector
business. Purchasing procedures -- not to mention corruption
-- increase the operating costs of public-sector companies
for the benefit of privileged suppliers, many times acting as
"cartels." Such sinecures are not lost without a fight,
naturally.
   Argentina's provinces have become yet another player in
the YPF privatization process, claiming that they should
receive a larger share of the royalties. This is not the
place to get into the complexities or merits of this debate.
But the underlying cause for such confrontations is the
stagnant economy. A concerted and intense investment drive
would increase oil royalties to a level that could satisfy
provincial governments as well as fulfill the requirements of
the nation as a whole.
   What is substantive in all this is that Argentina is
opening a promising path for oil and gas production to be
driven fundamentally by private investment -- domestic and
foreign. Even though there are obstacles to be overcome,
there is a strong and healthy undercurrent of popular support
for this policy direction. Building on this support, and with
the political determination and executive decisiveness that
alone can achieve worthwhile goals, success well may be at
hand.
