   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- A state court judge dismissed a
class-action lawsuit filed by Cablevision Systems Corp.
subscribers, charging the cable-TV operator with fraud,
restraint of trade and false advertising.
   The suit stemmed from a dispute between Cablevision and
the Madison Square Garden Network sports cable channel. MSG
is a subsidiary of Paramount Communications Inc.

   In September 1988, a contract under which Cablevision
carried the MSG network as an optional service expired. MSG
had wanted Cablevision to carry the sports network as part of
a basic package. From mid-September until July 5, 1989, the
network wasn't carried on Cablevision at all.
   The subscribers charged that Cablevision was obligated to
reduce its rates while it didn't carry MSG, and they demanded
damages from the company.
   In dismissing the suit June 29, Judge John Copertino said
that when Cablevision started carrying MSG, the Woodbury,
N.Y., cable operator couldn't have known that the network
would become unavailable. Further, the court said, once the
dispute arose, Cablevision notified its subscribers that MSG
might become unavailable, and "all a dissatisfied customer
had to do was cancel the more-expensive package or terminate
the relationship in its entirety."
   On the issue of restraint of trade, the subscribers failed
to show a conspiracy existed to keep MSG out of Cablevision's
offerings, the court said. Cablevision also runs
SportsChannel, a sports network that competes with MSG.
   And the subscribers didn't show that at the time they
subscribed, "MSG was unavailable and that the advertising
complained of was then being run, rendering such advertising
or inducements to take service based on MSG's availability
`deceptive,'" the court said.
   Cablevision and MSG settled their dispute in July 1989; in
most of Cablevision's systems, MSG remained optional. It will
be an option on all Cablevision systems after the 1990
baseball season.
   Cablevision did reach agreements with state regulators to
make refunds to some subscribers. In November 1989, it agreed
to refund $490,545 to Connecticut subscribers; and in January
1990, it agreed to refunds in New York totaling as much as
$1.1 million. The company wasn't found to have violated any
laws or regulations.
   Thomas J. Sinnickson, the subscribers' attorney in Center
Moriches, N.Y., said the plaintiffs will seek to reargue the
case "based on new evidence arising from certain admissions"
Cablevision made in its settlement agreement in New York. The
plaintiffs also will file an appeal with a higher state
court, he added.
