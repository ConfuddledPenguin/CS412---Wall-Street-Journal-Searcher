   We keep thinking of how Yankee pitcher Andy Hawkins lost a
no-hitter because a rookie left-fielder dropped a fly ball.
"That's baseball," shrugged the rookie. Sad but true. Why, we
ask, should baseball continue as if it were still possible to
find a league's worth of young players who can hit, field and
chew gum at the same time? Perhaps baseball ought to consider
revising the pathetic spectacle of shortstops who bat .200
and slugging outfielders who can't catch. Maybe baseball
should do what everyone else has done: Specialize. Instead of
one designated hitter, how about nine designated hitters and
nine designated fielders? Traditionalists would scream, but,
Pop, times have changed since you were a boy. Kids don't play
pickup baseball all day anymore; they play only in organized
leagues, which means some rookies arrive in the Majors with
the fielding skills of a Little Leaguer. Let kids see what
real fielding and batting used to look like, before they're
extinct.
