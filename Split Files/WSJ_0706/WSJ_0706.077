   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department proposed fines of
$508,000 against Pyro Mining Co., a coal-mining concern, and
$1 million against Johanna Farms, a dairy and citrus-product
packaging firm, on charges of safety violations.
   The department's Mine Safety and Health Administration
cited Pyro Mining's William Station mine in Union County,
Ky., for 121 violations, including alleged electrical-safety
violations and failure to make required safety examinations.

   The mine-safety agency said the proposed fine stemmed from
a methane explosion at the mine last September that killed 10
people. The agency said the explosion occurred after
explosive methane gas accumulated without being detected.
   The penalties would be a record amount for the mine-safety
agency, four times the largest fine assessed for any previous
single mine accident. The violations were "flagrant" and
showed Pyro Mining's "negligence," William Tattersall,
assistant secretary of labor for the agency, said.
   Separately, the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration cited Johanna Farms, Flemington, N.J.,
for violating safety and record-keeping standards. The
company, which packages dairy products, citrus juices and
yogurt, is a unit of John LaBatt Ltd., a holding company
based in North London, Ontario.
   Johanna Farms was cited for 197 willful instances of
failure to report injuries and illnesses and for 23 instances
of allowing workers to be exposed to unguarded machinery.
OSHA said 34 employees also were exposed to unguarded
sprockets and chains, among other safety violations. Gerard
Scannell, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said the
company suffered "a serious breakdown in its internal safety
and health program."
   Pyro Mining has 30 days to contest its citations and
proposed fine before the independent Federal Mine Safety and
Health Review Commission. Johanna Farms has 15 days to
contest its citations and fine before the Occupational Safety
and Health Review Commission.
