   Prime Motor Inns Inc., Fairfield, N.J., closed the sale of
the Rodeway Inns International franchise system for $14.9
million to Manor Care Inc., Silver Spring, Md.
   "As with the sale earlier this week of the Howard Johnson
and Ramada franchise systems, we will apply the proceeds of
this transaction to further reduce our bank debt," Prime's
chairman, Peter E. Simon, said. Prime sold Ramada and Howard
Johnson to Blackstone Group's Blackstone Capital Partners
L.P. affiliate for $170 milllion.
