   Tokyo stocks finished lower in dreary trading Thursday,
hurt by investor reluctance to participate amid weaker
currency and bond markets, traders said.
   London stock prices also were down.

   At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down
94.25 points at 32351.67. The index gained 31.32 points
Wednesday.
   At midmorning Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was up
39.72 points to 32391.39.
   Thursday's volume on the First Section was estimated at
460 million shares, down from 546 million Wednesday.
   Winning issues narrowly outpaced losing issues, 476 to
463, while 187 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which rose 13.87 points Wednesday,
slipped 1.31 points, or 0.06%, to 2362.04.
   The Second Section index, which added 19.17 points
Wednesday, jumped 30.96 points, or 0.73%, to close at
4253.80. Volume was estimated at 31.4 million shares, up from
28.3 million Wednesday.
   Julian Jones of W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co. (Overseas) Ltd. said
that the yen's retreat in Tokyo trading after a strong
performance overseas overnight was the underlying cause of
the quiet activity.
   The dollar reached a high of 151.10 after closing at
149.75 yen in London late Wednesday and 150.30 yen in Tokyo
Wednesday.
   The currency rate's move above 150 yen to the dollar was
bearish news for the Japanese bond market, with the yield on
the benchmark No. 119, 4.8% coupon of 1999 remaining near
7.22% throughout the day, up two basis points on the day.
   The bond market's weakness inhibited buying in futures,
offering very limited opportunities for arbitrage, which has
been keeping the market afloat over the past few days, Mr.
Jones said.
   Although large brokerage houses were spotted performing
basket purchases on the Nikkei index, including some limited
arbitrage buying, the adverse situation in currency and bond
markets prevented any large gain in futures, putting a cap on
profitability.
   Mr. Jones said, meanwhile, that the recent increased
participation of Japanese brokerage firms in conducting
arbitrage is a new and significant factor for the market.
   Oil stocks were one of the few advancing sectors in the
market Thursday.
   Kevin Haag, a trader in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities Co., said that the rise was probably technically
triggered, with share prices at relatively inexpensive levels
lately.
   But Stephen Good, a representative in Japanese equity
sales at McIntosh Securities, noted that the rise may have
been more fundamental, on speculation that oil prices may
have bottomed out.
   W.I. Carr's Mr. Jones lent support to the latter theory,
making reference to still-higher inventory reports in the
U.S. that have damped oil prices there and have helped weaken
U.K. Brent prices.
   Mr. Haag argued, however, that prospects for oil companies
aren't strong for the mid-term, adding that 4% or 5% growth
on earnings prospects isn't strong enough to justify
fundamental-based buying.
   Petroleum shares advanced broadly, with Mitsubishi Oil
gaining 40 yen (26 cents) to 1,260 yen and Nippon Oil rising
30 yen to finish at 1,360.
   Also higher were electricals and precision machinery
makers. Aiwa was up 90 at 2,540 and NEC advanced 30 to 1,990.
   Nikon increased 20 to 1,700 while Konica gained 60 to
1,630.
   Construction companies generally finished the day lower
after their strong advances Wednesday. Ohbayashi went down 30
to 1,660, while Kajima lost 40 to 1,950.
   London share prices posted hefty losses at the close of
trading, as the worsening outlook for U.K. corporate profits
and the continued spate of company downgradings by analysts
have taken center stage.
   The market started the session easier and continued its
descent. When Wall Street also reversed its recent trend and
shares softened throughout the London afternoon session, the
London market took its cue from that drop and ended mostly in
the red.
   But volume was relatively poor, with 386.8 million shares
changing hands. This was only slightly above Wednesday's 353
million shares, when the U.S. market was closed for
Independence Day.
   Traders said it was too soon to tell whether the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was establishing a new,
lower trading range, but they conceded that negative
sentiment is mounting.
   The 100-index ended down 24.1 points at 2331.4. At the
day's low the index was down 27.7 points. The intraday high
was reached just after the start of official trading, when
the index was 3.3 points easier.
   The narrower FT-SE 30-share index ended down 22.9 points
at 1858.2.
   In the futures market, the September FT-SE 100-share index
was quoted at 2393.0, down from its close Wednesday of
2424.0.
   Shares to post large losses included Pearson, down 16
pence (28 cents) at 768, and RMC, down 24 at 665.
   P&amp;O continued to suffer from Wednesday's downgrading by
James Capel, ending down 11 pence at 617. Reckitt &amp; Colman
also continued its descent, following its profit warning
earlier in the week, ending down 21 pence at #1,244 pence
($22.09).
   The only sector to show gains was the retail banks. One
dealer said this was largely due to continued rumors of a
merger between Midland and its 14.9% shareholder, HongKong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp. A dealer with County Natwest Woodmac,
which issued a buy recommendation for Midland Wednesday, said
the firm was convinced the merger would take place within
12-18 months.
   Midland ended up 8 pence at 303.
   The entire banking sector benefited from the talk, but the
sector appears to be generally undergoing an upward move
after its recent underperformance on debt worries.
   National Westminster ended up 2 at 322, while Barclays was
up 4 at 391. Lloyds closed 6 higher at 287.
   Share prices closed higher in Stockholm, lower in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Madrid, and mixed
in Milan. South African gold stocks were lower.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and
Manila, were mixed in Wellington and lower in Hongkong,
Taipei and Seoul.
