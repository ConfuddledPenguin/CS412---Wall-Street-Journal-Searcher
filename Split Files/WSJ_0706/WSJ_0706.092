   SAN FRANCISCO -- Two environmental groups here said they
filed an administrative complaint against Dow Chemical Co.,
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and six other concerns charging that 16
common household spot removers and paint strippers made by
the companies violate California's tough toxic labeling law.
   Among the products named were Dow Chemical's popular K2-r
Spot-lifter and Sears Paint and Varnish Remover. Under the
law, makers of products containing known carcinogens must
label them with "a clear warning of the cancer risks."
Companies that fail to do so can face fines of as much as
$2,500 per consumer estimated to have bought the product
during the time that chemicals have been on the state's
official carcinogen roster.

   In the case of the 16 products named in the complaint, the
exposure is 15 months, thus the potential liability adds up
"comfortably to hundreds of millions of dollars," said David
Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund. The fund filed the
action with the Sierra Club. The toxics law, known as
Proposition 65, was adopted by voters in 1986 but contained
phase-in provisions designed to give companies time to
comply.
   The fund and the Sierra Club filed a similar complaint in
September against Gillette Co. for its alleged failure to
label its Liquid Paper correction fluid. Gillette, without
admitting guilt, agreed to pay a $300,000 settlement to the
state and changed the Liquid Paper formula to eliminate the
offending carcinogen.
   Under the toxics law, any citizen or group may file an
administrative action if it believes the labeling law isn't
being adhered to. The complaint by the fund and Sierra Club
triggers a 60-day period in which the state must decide
whether it will prosecute the alleged offenses. If it
declines to do so, the law allows the environmental groups to
file their own suits to seek damages on behalf of the public.
   As the Gillette case demonstrated, the unofficial purpose
of the 60-day period is to give alleged offenders an
incentive, avoiding the prospect of enormous fines, to
reformulate their products or quickly comply with Proposition
65's labeling provisions. Any such voluntary agreement,
however, "doesn't {necessarily} exempt the companies from
potential penalties," said the fund's Mr. Roe.
   Besides Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich., and Chicago-based
Sears, the action names Jasco Chemicals Corp., Mountain View,
Calif.; Standard Brands Paint Co., Torrance, Calif.; Thompson
&amp; Formby Inc., Montvale, N.J.; Carbona Products, Brooklyn,
N.Y.; Northern Labs Inc., Manitowoc, Wis.; and Cadillac Shoe
Products Inc. of Royal Oak, Mich.
   A Dow Chemical spokesman said, "If we're not in
compliance, we'll change that. But whether or not we're in
compliance, I can't say right now." He added that there has
been some confusion over which products should be covered by
the law.
   Daniel Thomas, general manager of Jasco, and Craig Walker,
a Standard Brands vice president, said the companies hadn't
seen the complaint but are in compliance with the law.
   Officials of the other companies couldn't be reached for
comment.
