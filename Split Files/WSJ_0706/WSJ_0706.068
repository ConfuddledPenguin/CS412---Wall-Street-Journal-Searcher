   EUROPEAN TV CONSORTIUM

   A group of 14 broadcasting and telecommunications concerns
from five European Community nations will launch next week a
consortium to promote high-definition television, familiarly
termed HDTV.
   The consortium, called Vision 1250, "will set up and
manage both fixed and mobile HDTV facilities to be made
available to TV and audio-visual professionals and
broadcasters in the European Community," the EC Commission
said. Vision 1250 is an initiative of the commission, which
last year unveiled a strategy to guarantee a healthy share of
the global HDTV market for EC industries.
   Under the EC's strategy, HDTV will be introduced
commercially in the EC beginning in 1992 -- in time to cover
the summer and winter Olympics.
   HDTV promises better picture and sound quality than
conventional television. However, international standards and
equipment for transmission must be set. The EC, Japan, and
the U.S. haven't yet agreed on those standards.
                                                                                                       

   LANDMARK RULING IN TOKYO
                                                                                                       

   A Tokyo district court has ruled for the first time that
female workers were denied promotions due to sex
discrimination. It awarded 18 women a total of $640,000 in
lost wages they would have received had they been promoted.
The suit was filed 10 years ago by women who worked for a
medical-insurance fund. In addition to money for lost wages,
the plaintiffs had also sought promotions, but the court
refused, saying it couldn't direct such personnel decisions.
                                                                                                       

   TRINIDAD TOURISM
                                                                                                       

   Tourism officials in Trinidad and Tobago are wooing
Europeans. "We feel Europe is a better market {than the U.S.}
for us," said one tourism official, adding: "Europeans stay
longer and spend more." According to a study by the country's
Tourist Development Authority, U.S. travel to Caribbean
holiday destinations, already in a slump, is expected to
decline further. "The fall-off in demand is being attributed
. . . to a loss in {Caribbean} competitiveness together with
the impact of an expected recessionary period" in the U.S.,
the study said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW JAPANESE COINS
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Finance Ministry officials, overseeing the
minting of 100,000 yen ($662) gold coins to celebrate the
enthronement of Emperor Akihito in November, are going to
great lengths to ensure that the issue is counterfeitproof. A
Japanese news-agency said the new coins would be larger,
contain more gold and be etched with a more elaborate design
than 11 million similar coins issued in 1986 and 1987 to
commemorate the 60th year of the reign of the late Emperor
Hirohito. Allegations last winter that some of the Hirohito
coins were counterfeits reportedly underlies the Ministry of
Finance's attempts to make the enthronement coins impossible
to fake.
                                                                                                       

   BP'S EAST GERMAN PLANS
                                                                                                       

   British Petroleum PLC's West German operating subsidiary
plans to market a range of petroleum products in East Germany
and intends to establish a network of service stations there.
Deutsche BP AG said that to realize its goals of expanding
into the newly opened East German market, it has agreed to a
cooperative arrangement with East Germany's Leuna Werken
refinery and trading group Intrac Handelsgesellschaft.
                                                                                                       

   ITALY'S CATHOLICS VS. MADONNA
                                                                                                       

   Italy's Roman Catholic establishment has begun a campaign
to keep Madonna's European concert tour out of the country.
The Catholic news agency SIR, which reflects opinions of the
Italian Bishops' Conference, decried the singer's use of
crucifixes and sacred symbols in concerts and videos. "Her
new show . . . is an offense to good taste," the agency said.
Madonna, whose ancestry is Italian, is due to perform in Rome
and Turin next week.
                                                                                                       

   EC LABOR-COST STUDY
                                                                                                       

   Southern European Community countries may not have as much
of a labor-cost advantage over the richer northern countries
as is often believed, according to a new EC study.
   Differences in nominal labor costs throughout the EC are
largely offset by differences in productivity, the study
said, meaning there is little incentive for companies to
shift production to low-wage member states.
   "Low wages do not necessarily mean low labor costs," the
EC Commission report said. It said the cost of labor as a
percentage of the value added to a product during
manufacturing varies only slightly from one EC country to
another.
   The study notes that the United Kingdom, where wages are
often lower than in other EC states, "has unit labor costs .
. . comparable to, and in a number of cases higher than,
those in the Federal Republic of Germany, France and Italy."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Police in Buenos Aires arrested three employees of the
Argentine capital's largest municipal cemetery. The three are
suspected of stealing hundreds of used coffins and, after
refurbishing them, selling them as new. . . . In London,
Barbara Johnson, an heiress to the Johnson &amp; Johnson
health-products fortune, bought an 18th-century cabinet at
Christie's for $15.3 million. According to the auction house,
the lavishly inlaid "Badminton Cabinet," made in Florence for
a Duke of Beaufort, thus became the most expensive piece of
furniture in the world.
