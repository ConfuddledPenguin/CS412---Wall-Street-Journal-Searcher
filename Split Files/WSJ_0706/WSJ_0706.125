   Union Carbide is still paying the price for escaping the
clutches of GAF Corp. in 1986. To avoid a takeover, Carbide
went deeply in debt to pay a huge special dividend. It also
sold its consumer products operations.
   Now Carbide is mainly a maker of commodity chemicals --
those made in large quantities by several manufacturers. The
company is caught in a cyclical downturn of
commodity-chemical prices and still bears a heavy, though
reduced, debt burden. Its shares, which briefly rose above 30
in 1987 and 1989, closed yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange at 19 1/8, down 1/4 from Tuesday.

   No question the stock is cheap. The question is whether
cheapness is enough. Carbide is selling for only eight times
estimated 1990 per-share earnings -- and a mere five times
the past 12 months' earnings. It yields just over 5% in
dividends.
   At these prices, Carbide is picking up some fans. Five
brokerage houses recommend it -- not a huge cheering section,
but the biggest in quite a while. "The stock is arguably as
cheap as it has ever been over the last 20 years," writes
John L. Garcia, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder. It could
double in two years, suggests Leslie Ravitz of Salomon
Brothers. And Sasho Dalov, editor of Wall Street Wire,
speculates that Carbide could be a takeover candidate.
   But others who follow the stock closely say that Carbide
is likely to stay cheap for at least a year or two. Earnings
are being hurt by world-wide oversupply of Carbide's mainstay
chemicals -- polyethylene (a common plastic) and ethylene
glycol (used in antifreeze and polyester fabric). Carbide's
profit is likely to fall to around $2.50 a share this year
from $3.92 last year, analysts say.
   That unfavorable outlook is already reflected in the stock
price. But William Young, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, says it is too early to buy on fundamentals. The
balance between supply and demand for commodity chemicals
began worsening a little over a year ago, he says, and "that
down cycle tends to last more than one or two years."
   Mr. Ravitz of Salomon Brothers thinks Carbide should
appeal to patient investors. "Short-term, we don't think the
stock's going to do anything," he says. But "the downside is
moderate." Some time in the first half of 1991, he argues,
the stock market will begin anticipating a recovery in prices
of commodity chemicals.
   Carbide's other major division -- industrial gases -- is
growing faster than the chemicals-and-plastics division and
enjoys improving prices. Unfortunately, it has major
operations in Brazil, where an iron-handed anti-inflation
program crushed economic activity earlier this year. So the
industrial-gases division's 1990 results are expected to be
flat.
   Money managers and analysts have been hoping Carbide would
spin off the industrial-gases business or sell a minority
interest in it to the public to avoid the risk of a future
takeover. Their appetites were whetted last year when Carbide
set up separate divisions for its major business lines. But
this February, Carbide said that it had decided not to do a
spinoff or partial public offering.
   Among the disappointed parties was the T. Rowe Price
family of mutual funds, which had bought 600,000 shares early
this year. "We thought that management was beginning to take
actions to unlock the value" of the company, says Charlie
Ober, a T. Rowe Price analyst. "We have been unpleasantly
surprised that there hasn't been any follow-through."
   The lack of follow-through, some money managers think,
means Carbide no longer fears a takeover, now that such
activity has cooled. A Carbide spokesman declined to go
beyond the statement the company made in February or discuss
the company's stock price.
   Mr. Ravitz, for one, still has hopes. He thinks the
marketplace may bludgeon Carbide into action. "Before the
(February) announcement, the stock was at 24; now it's at
19," he says. He thinks Carbide could spin off its smallest
unit, the carbon products division.
   David A. Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset
Advisors in New York, says his firm won't buy Carbide because
of its debt load. Currently, total debt is more than half of
capital.
   He prefers rival chemical makers B.F. Goodrich and
Imperial Chemical Industries. With a good dose of revenue
from specialty chemicals, Goodrich enjoys better pricing. It
sells for about nine times the past 12 months' earnings and
yields 4.7%. London-based Imperial's output is about evenly
divided among commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. ICI, based in London, produces
pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals as well as commodity
chemicals. It sells for less than 10 times earnings and
yields 5.9%.
