   Would a new tax on securities trading send the stock
market for a loop?
   Many traders, securities-industry executives and academics
believe that a federal tax on securities sales, like that now
being considered by the Bush administration, would probably
trigger an initial slump in stock prices and volume.

   But the longer-term effects on trading and capital raising
might not be as dire as Wall Street is predicting. Indeed,
the idea of a trading tax drew support from some corporate
leaders and academic experts.
   "There has been too much money made in speculation and
churning and . . . program trading, which does nothing for
America," said Eli Broad, chairman of Broad Inc. and home
builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. in Los Angeles. "It's high
time these activities be taxed," said Mr. Broad, who added,
however, that he opposes taxation on long-term investments.
   This newspaper disclosed yesterday that the so-called
securities transfer excise tax is getting serious
consideration in the White House as a way to raise taxes on
the rich.
   Word of the proposed tax drew immediate protest on Wall
Street. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. denounced such a move as
"extremely harmful to the nation's economic health." Other
critics are predicting sharp declines in the markets should
the tax be enacted.
   One prominent finance professor, Sanford J. Grossman of
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, warned: "The
Bush administration is toying with another crash."
   Indeed, traders blamed part of yesterday's 32.42-point
drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the biggest decline
in two weeks, on jitters over the possible new tax.
   "We're taking it damned seriously," said Stephen Bell, a
lobbyist for Salomon Brothers Inc., a big Wall Street
securities firm. A similar tax was proposed in 1987, and
died. But, "unlike a couple of years ago when it was opposed
fervently in the White House, we're not sure it's opposed
now," Mr. Bell said.
   If the tax is enacted, all investors, including
individuals, corporations and pension funds, would have to
pay a levy on sales of stocks, bonds, futures contracts and
other instruments. That levy could be as high as 0.5%,
although congressional aides said yesterday that a 0.15% levy
is more likely. That would be enough to raise $27 billion
over five years.
   Any actual tax could be levied at a fixed rate, but also
could be variable, based on who was doing the trading and how
long they held a security.
   But would the tax really matter to corporations looking to
raise capital, aside from the initial expected decline in the
stock market?
   Perhaps not. Many major countries already have securities
transfer taxes in place, including Belgium, Denmark, France,
Portugal, Spain, Italy, Japan, West Germany, Britain and
Canada. "Their economies appear not to have suffered from the
tax, which contributes significantly to their tax receipts,"
says a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
   Even Wall Streeters who are against the tax see how it
could eventually be digested by the markets -- albeit at
small investors' expense.
   Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equity operations at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said that after the initial
price declines, the stock market would simply have to live
with the higher costs. The problem, he said, is that the cost
of the tax would likely be passed on to small investors,
partly through the pension funds that would be paying more to
trade. (Pension funds last year accounted for 25% of all
stock transactions, by some estimates.)
   Brokerage firms would also suffer, Mr. Da Puzzo said. "It
does hurt the securities industry, which right now is coming
out of a bit of difficult times. Now you're going to increase
our costs."
   But some experts think a trading tax would help the
securities markets by imposing a financial penalty on those
who trade too much, like computer-aided program traders. The
transaction tax "would take the froth off" the securities
markets, said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard University
economics professor. "At the margin it would have no effect
on long-term investments, but it is very expensive on the
in-again-out-again guy."
   Mr. Summers said the tax "would tend to fall on
destabilizing strategies" such as portfolio insurance,
stock-index arbitrage and extensive use of stop-loss
strategies and momentum-based commodity market strategies.
   After the 1987 stock-market crash, some experts argued
that it would be helpful if the markets were slowed down
through a transaction tax. "I believe there is a strong case
for throwing a little sand in the wheels," Yale University
professor James Tobin has said.
   President Bush already is on record as favoring some type
of securities tax. In the administration's fiscal 1991
budget, released in January, Mr. Bush proposed an
11-cents-a-trade transaction tax on commodity trades and a
small levy on over-the-counter stocks that would expand a fee
charged on exchange-listed stocks.
   The administration's new proposal, which two weeks ago was
merely one of about 20 revenue-generating ideas being kicked
around in the heat of the budget summit, now has picked up
speed.
   Administration and congressional negotiators are looking
to raise $25 billion or more of revenue a year. "I think that
two weeks ago, it was one of 20 proposals," said Bruce
Thompson Jr., the Washington lobbyist for Merrill Lynch.
"Last week all of a sudden it got on a very short list."
   The proposal appears to be supported by several top
administration officials. Budget Director Richard Darman
would back such a plan because it would appear to tax the
wealthy, several lobbyists said. Then he could offer that as
a sweetener to a cut of the capital-gains tax.
   The plan also may have the approval of Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who has been an outspoken supporter of
creating incentives for investors to hold securities longer.
Since a transfer tax would penalize short-term holdings it
could help achieve that goal.
   Wall Street firms dispute the view that the new tax would
hit only the wealthy, noting that the tax would hit pension
funds. "It is instead a regressive tax on the savings and
retirement income of millions of Americans," Merrill Lynch
says in a full-page advertisement prepared for next Monday's
edition of Roll Call, a Washington newspaper. "This tax is a
terrible idea," the ad states.
   Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry
Association, Wall Street's main trade group, said that even
if the tax proposal is merely a "trial balloon" being floated
by the White House, his group wants to puncture it.
   The securities group said that many of the countries that
currently have transaction taxes -- including Italy, Japan,
West Germany, Britain and Canada -- are taking steps to
reduce or eliminate their levies.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission official, who
declined to be named, said U.S. markets would surely lose
some business if the tax is enacted. "A lot of the
discretionary business done on the U.S. exchanges could be
done elsewhere," the official said.
   Although any new tax would likely apply to trades made by
Americans on foreign exchanges, U.S. traders might well find
ways around it. Mr. O'Brien, the securities association
president, conceded that traders will "try to avoid it in the
most efficient way they can."
   Hyman P. Minsky, a scholar at the Jerome Levy Economics
Institute, said it would be almost impossible for regulators
to stop trades from migrating overseas. "Are you going to put
an SEC man or a tax collector behind every terminal?" he
asked.
   The New York Stock Exchange, which has been already hurt
by a migration of trading business overseas, said only:
"There's no proposal on the table and it is premature to
comment until a proposal is made."
   Futures brokers in Chicago, meanwhile, are worried that a
transaction tax might stand a good chance in Washington
because of the futures industry's soiled reputation over
recent trading scandals. Robert Anderson, president of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock Corp., said the
futures industry already pays extra fees that securities
traders don't. "Everybody is against having their ox gored,"
Mr. Anderson said. "But futures are a pretty easy whipping
boy."
   One of the loudest opponents of the proposed tax yesterday
was the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest
commodities exchange. "George Bush has gone from `no new
taxes' to `total new taxes.'" said Thomas R. Donovan, Board
of Trade president. "This administration is looking for the
American financial markets to bail out the savings and loans
fiasco, and with this proposal, they will compound their
error in judgment."
