   Investigating the self-serving policies of Third World
kleptocrats could wear out your shoes in no time. Guy Sorman
focused on 18 countries as he roamed five continents to write
"The New Wealth of Nations" (Hoover Institution, 215 pages,
$14). Well before he had reached his last stop, Zanzibar, a
wormy hellhole with a concrete collective housing project
nicknamed East Berlin, the French journalist and economics
professor had a long list of why the Third World is, with a
few exceptions, a basket case.
   The title is not meant to be facetious, of course, but a
tribute to the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith,
who wrote "An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations" in a Europe that resembles, writes Mr.
Sorman, the Third World today. He cites the "intertwining of
great wealth and great poverty, traditional cultures shaken
by modernization, conflict between despotism and democracy,
intense intellectual ferment." But Mr. Sorman's book also is
a tribute to the hard-working people he met on his travels,
individuals who "reject not only poverty, but the yoke of
monstrous police forces, raving dictatorships, crushing
bureaucracies."

   Obviously Mr. Sorman spent a lot of time on the African
continent. He watched farmers scratch listlessly on land they
don't own, and he flew high above it with one of the lunatics
who took it away. "How then is it that such a perfect
society, the Tanzanian nation, has continued getting poorer?"
Mr. Sorman asks Tanzania's Julius Nyerere.
   "It's Reagan's fault; Margaret Thatcher caught him and the
infection spread even to Mitterrand]" Mr. Nyerere screams
over the roaring engines. When Tanzania's maximum leader
ponders dwindling revenues from once-profitable cashew crops,
he blames prices set by free-market "imperialists" somewhere
far away. He does not blame his own state monopoly that pays
peasants an unrealistically low price for which they just
will not grow lots of those little nuts.
   It seems that Mr. Nyerere didn't get around to reading
Smith when he studied in Scotland of all places, though he's
pretty fluent in socialist slogans. The sight of Third
Worldians the world over proudly replacing colonial shackles
with Western left-wing ideologies never fails to enchant Mr.
Sorman. Encounters with innovative thinkers never fail to
elate him.
   "I would render ill service to my people if I made them
pay, like the rest of the continent, for their independence
with poverty," says Gatsha Buthelezi, chief of South Africa's
seven million Zulus. Unfashionably pro-capitalist, unlike
Nelson Mandela, Chief Buthelezi doesn't get much space in the
Western media, which cheers the rejection of socialism in
Eastern Europe but welcomes it eagerly in South Africa. There
are many ironies in the world and in this book.
   There also is much that is out-of-date. Since "The New
Wealth of Nations" was first published in France in 1987,
much has changed in the Third World landscapes that Mr.
Sorman describes in a jargon-free, breezy prose nicely
captured by Asha Puri. Updating here and there, Mr. Sorman
does refer to Tiananmen Square, if only to enter the massacre
as evidence that China's gerontocracy will continue to
maintain a clear-cut distinction between economics and
politics. "The instruments of central, civil and military
power are being modernized in China," he writes, but only to
consolidate the power base, not to affect the development of
society as a whole."
   Curiously, Mr. Sorman makes no mention of Mexico's ongoing
attempts at reform (including privatizing agriculture),
though the meeting he had with Octavio Paz, the wise old
chronicler of Mexican misdeeds, remains interesting reading
and sets up most of the book. Why is it, Mr. Paz asks, that
the Mexican who in his country conforms to the "cliche of the
passive, lazy peasant, suddenly becomes hardworking and
enterprising when he crosses the border? Is it not proof that
poverty and servility are products of the Mexican political
system rather than deriving from historical or natural
causes?"
   The way Mr. Sorman sees it, less government always is
better. Socialism has not brought ongoing progress to any
country; state capitalism has only dramatized the gap between
rich and poor with its grotesque emphasis on
industrialization and bloated public sector. And
international aid packages mostly entrench and enrich the
bureaucracy. If countries can't repay their debts, writes Mr.
Sorman, it is because most of the billions have been
redirected to private bank accounts. Why don't we hear more
about shameless stealing come restructuring time? he wonders.
   Why, for that matter, is not more made of the Soviet aid
package to Cuba? Still $4 billion plus, it's a sum that could
help retire the annoying begging bowl Mikhail Gorbachev
travels with on the Beltway. In an amusing chapter, Mr.
Sorman reports how he fell into a hypnotic stupor listening
to Cuba's minister of health droning on about the wonderful
network of polyclinics sprouting like cigars all over the
sunny isle. "Was it really necessary," he asks, "to force a
million Cubans to go into exile, curtail individual liberty,
and imprison political opponents by the thousands so that the
Cuban people could have good teeth?"
