   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision said it has
decided to make public its conflict-of-interest case against
Neil Bush, the president's son and a former director of a
failed Denver thrift, over his protests that the action is
"political."
   The thrift office also announced that an administrative
law judge has ordered a Sept. 25 hearing in the case
involving Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association.

   The thrift office announced the date of the hearing and
released its administrative charges against Mr. Bush as part
of a new policy under which more of the agency's enforcement
cases will be made public. The September hearing will be open
to the public as well.
   Mr. Bush objected that making his case public "would be
political," said Harris Weinstein, chief counsel of the
thrift office. But Timothy Ryan, thrift office director, made
the decision to open the case.
   Mr. Ryan said the new policy "is necessary to reassure the
public that as regulators we are doing everything possible to
assure the integrity of thrift institutions and the
protection of the taxpayer."
   The thrift office has charged that Mr. Bush violated
savings-and-loan regulations by voting to approve Silverado
loans to a business partner, and by failing to disclose to
the Silverado board his business ties to borrowers. The most
important charges released yesterday had already been aired
in House Banking Committee hearings on the Silverado failure.
   Mr. Bush has denied any wrongdoing, arguing that while his
business partners invested in his oil and gas operations, he
didn't invest in their businesses and thus wouldn't benefit
by helping them obtain loans. Mr. Bush served on Silverado's
board from August 1985 until August 1988. He resigned after
his father won the Republican presidential nomination.
Silverado was taken over by the government in December 1988,
at an expected cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   The OTS is seeking an order barring Mr. Bush from
violating S&amp;L regulations in the future. He refused to sign a
consent agreement in January, leading to the filing of the
administrative charges in February. The administrative law
judge will recommend action to Mr. Ryan, who will make the
final decision.
   Under the thrift office's new policy, administrative
hearings on enforcement actions involving thrifts that have
been closed or taken over by the government will be open to
the public. The targets of the charges may ask that the
thrift office close the proceedings, but the final decision
lies with the agency's director.
   The thrift office said enforcement hearings that involve
officers of still-operating S&amp;Ls will generally be closed,
out of concern that publicity could cause a depositor run.
But if the individual involved isn't a current officer, the
OTS said it will be "inclined" to make the proceedings
public.
