   LOS ANGELES -- Visa International Inc. and MasterCard
International Inc. said they filed a lawsuit charging 10
individuals and 11 companies with carrying out a
telemarketing scheme designed to saddle consumers with
millions of dollars in fraudulent charges.
   The parties lured credit-card holders to call
telemarketers by promising free cars and cash prizes,
sometimes passing themselves as sanctioned by MasterCard and
Visa, the companies charged. Telemarketers in "boiler-rooms"
then used high pressure tactics to sell water purifiers,
security systems, travel packages and vitamins to card
holders, they said. Visa and MasterCard said customers didn't
receive merchandise and were billed as many as three times.

   Visa and MasterCard said losses from the alleged scheme
total $4 million, and they expect that total to grow. The
companies are seeking damages and $10 million in punitive
damages.
