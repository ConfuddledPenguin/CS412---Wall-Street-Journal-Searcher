   NEW YORK -- Stock prices fell sharply in very thin
trading, triggered by news that the Bush administration might
back a 0.5% tax on securities sales as part of a budget
deficit-reduction package.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 32.42 points to
2879.21. Bond prices also sank, but the dollar was mixed.

   Much of the activity in stocks was generated by program
traders intent on capturing profits from fleeting price
discrepancies between stock-index futures contracts and the
underlying stocks. Stock futures prices fell faster than
stock prices, so program traders bought the cheaper futures
and sold stocks. Their tactics caused the Dow Jones
industrials to fall in spasmodic fashion during the morning.
   Moreover, "Talk about a stock transfer tax provided some
excuse to sell" following five sessions of rising stock
prices, said James Solloway, chief economist at Argus
Research. He added that "it's way too early to tell whether
that tax will ever become a reality." In fact, the report may
turn out to be a trial balloon that quickly gets shot down,
he said.
   Another reason program trading had so much influence is
that many investors are either on vacation or sitting on the
sidelines awaiting this morning's disclosure of June jobs
data. Many investors are hoping that payroll employment
growth will be weak enough to coax the Federal Reserve into
lowering interest rates soon.
   "I'm not buying that," said Mr. Solloway. "I think there
may be the chance to see a surprising gain in payroll
employment." If he is right, and if many investors already
have bet on a near-term Fed ease, both stocks and bonds could
be in for rough sledding.
   Bond prices didn't react to the tax talk and were
unchanged most of the day. Then, June car sales came in
stronger than expected, leading some investors to wonder if
today's employment report might follow suit.
   Uncertainty about interest rates continues to affect the
dollar. It closed only slightly higher against the mark,
which is holding steady in the aftermath of monetary union
between East and West Germany. The yen strengthened on the
expectation of lower U.S. interest rates, which would make
Japanese rates relatively more appealing.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 128.3 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues swamped
advancers, 1,058 to 397.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell more than a quarter of a point, or more
than $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount, in light trading.
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to
8.40%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6517 marks and 150.60 yen, compared
with 1.6505 marks and 150.90 yen Tuesday.
