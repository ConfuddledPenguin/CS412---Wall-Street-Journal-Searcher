Nutricia has a simple product strategy: It makes food for
people who don't have any choice about what they eat.
   Nutricia is one of the top European makers of infant
formula and baby cereals, competing with the likes of Nestle
S.A. of Switzerland and Milupa AG of West Germany in a market
where doctors and parents call the shots. Once an infant
outgrows such fare, Nutricia bows out, leaving the
mass-market food companies to scrap over fickle appetites.

   "The moment you don't feel well," says Erlend van der
Hagen, Nutricia's management-board chairman, "we jump in
again." The company's other core business is making special
foods and nutritional supplements for the ill, sold mostly to
hospitals.
   Somewhat less simple are Nutricia's choices about where to
expand outside its base in Western Europe -- a vital question
as the company seeks to retain its independence in a rapidly
consolidating food industry.
   Many Dutch companies have long viewed the U.S. as their
top priority for overseas growth. But Nutricia, which got a
late start breaking out of its home market, says it wants to
avoid an expensive fight for a large slice of the U.S.
market. Instead, Mr. van der Hagen said in an interview, the
company will put a higher priority on Europe (notably the
southern and eastern parts where its sales are still small)
and on the Far East.
   For decades after it was formed in 1901 by a doctor and a
dairy-plant operator, Nutricia was content with the Dutch
market. After World War II, the company spilled over the
border into Belgium. Then, in the 1970s, Nutricia made a
strategic choice that Mr. van der Hagen says was "totally
wrong." Rather than trying to become a global player in the
products it knew best, the company confined itself to the
Benelux market and diversified its product range into
margarine, sauces, pickles, processed fruits and snacks.
   By 1979, that strategy had driven Nutricia into the red.
The company's product range was too unfocused, and its
markets too small.
   Mr. van der Hagen, a grandson of one of the founders,
reacted by moving from Nutricia's supervisory board to the
management board in 1979. He quickly began selling the
diversified food units. "I simply put the company back to its
origins," he says.
   Mr. van der Hagen decided that Nutricia's future was in
products for which medical endorsements are vital rather than
those that require mass marketing. (The company kept a few
mass-market products, such as Chocomel chocolate milk and
Nutroma coffee creamer, which provide an outlet for milk fat
separated out in making infant formula. But those products
are sold only in the Benelux countries.)
   Mr. van der Hagen's approach has worked so far: Nutricia's
net income has doubled in the past five years, reaching 60.3
million guilders ($32 million) last year on sales of 905.3
million guilders, and the company's return on equity is well
above average at about 20%. The company also has raised the
share of its revenue derived outside the Netherlands to about
64% from 20% a decade ago.
   Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia began to organize
production on a pan-European scale long before the 1992
unified market plan took off. Asked about 1992, he says, "We
invented it in 1980."
   Even so, Nutricia had little presence in West Germany
until April, when it acquired Immergut Milch G.m.b.H., a
dairy-products company. Mr. van der Hagen promises to
transform Immergut into a German version of Nutricia.
   Milupa, Germany's leading infant-formula and baby-cereal
maker, says it isn't worried. Told about Nutricia's
ambitions, Milupa director Joerg Zehelein says, "Well, good
luck." Mr. Zehelein notes that other foreign health-care and
nutrition companies have found the German market extremely
hard to penetrate.
   One challenge for Nutricia is that German doctors tend to
favor feeding hospital patients intravenously. Nutricia's
products are "enteral" -- that is, absorbed through the
digestive system rather than the blood stream. But Mr. van
der Hagen says the German market is rapidly changing as
doctors recognize the advantages of enteral feeding, which is
far cheaper.
   Meanwhile, Nutricia predicts that it can increase its
market share in southern Europe and says it is gradually
building up ties with the medical profession in Eastern
Europe. Last year, after an eight-year effort, Nutricia
finally cracked the Soviet market with a big sale of infant
formula.
   The graying of the population is expanding the market for
medical nutrition throughout Europe; Campbell Management
Consultants of Brussels estimates that European sales of
enteral foods are growing 15% to 20% a year. But competition
is growing, too. Last year, Nestle and Baxter International
Inc. of the U.S. set up a joint venture in medical nutrition,
Clintec International Inc., which already has set up units in
Britain and Italy.
   While defending its home market, Nutricia also is trying
to expand in Asia, where it has sales units in Hong Kong and
Taiwan and a 50% share of a new infant-formula plant in
Indonesia. Though Asia accounted for just 3.6% of sales last
year, Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia aims to become one of
the leading suppliers there.
   The U.S. market already is mature and offers less room for
growth. In any case, analysts suspect that Nutricia doesn't
want to draw retaliatory attacks in its home market from such
companies as Abbott Laboratories Inc. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., which dominate the U.S. infant-formula market.
"We have no ambition to get into a fierce fight with Abbott,"
Mr. van der Hagen says.
   Milupa apparently agrees. The German company closed a
small infant-formula factory in the U.S. last year after
deciding it had better growth prospects in Europe.
   Still, Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia needs to be present
in the U.S. market to keep up with developments. Toward that
end, Nutricia acquired Loma Linda Foods Inc., a Riverside,
Calif., maker of soybased infant formula, from a Seventh-day
Adventist Church organization in 1988. Loma Linda has about
2% of the U.S. infant-formula market, and Mr. van der Hagen
says Nutricia hopes to boost that share gradually.
   Though Mr. van der Hagen talks cautiously, Dutch
investment analysts tend to be bullish on Nutricia. On the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the company's nonvoting
certificates, representing shares held by a trust, are
trading at about 14 times projected 1990 earnings, compared
with a market average of 9.7. Even with that high rating,
says Frans van Schaik of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland
N.V., Nutricia is still an attractive investment. He predicts
net income will surge at least 20% this year and another 10%
in 1991.
   Nutricia's certificates occasionally get a boost from
takeover speculation. Mr. van der Hagen says that many major
food companies have approached him about making a friendly
bid for Nutricia but that none has been able to tell him what
would be in it for Nutricia. (Unigate PLC of Britain owns
about 25% of the shares but can't raise its stake without
permission of Nutricia's board.)
   Though Nutricia says it is in good shape to survive as an
independent company, it isn't taking any chances. The company
has armed itself with all the protective barriers allowed to
Dutch companies, making a hostile takeover virtually
impossible.
   Earlier this year, the Amsterdam exchange pressed Nutricia
and other companies to give up some of their protective
barriers in an effort to bring Dutch stock market practices
closer to international norms. As a gentle form of pressure,
the exchange began using a special symbol in its official
gazette to flag companies that refuse to modify their
protective devices.
   Nutricia was unimpressed. "We have a black dot," Mr. van
der Hagen says gleefully, "and we're very proud of it."
   Eventually, the European Community is expected to force
Dutch companies to reduce their takeover protections. If that
happens, Mr. van der Hagen says, the company will simply find
somewhere else to list its nonvoting certificates.
