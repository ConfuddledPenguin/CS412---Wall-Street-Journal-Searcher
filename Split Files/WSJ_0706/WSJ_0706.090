resigned as a director of the London financial services
concern.

   Company officials weren't immediately available for
comment.
   Philip Arkless, company secretary, later said the
resignation was effective July 2. He said Mr. Thompson hadn't
given a reason for his departure in his letter of
resignation.
   Mr. Arkless also said it wasn't clear at this stage
whether Mr. Thompson would be replaced, given the company's
"unusual circumstances."
   British &amp; Commonwealth is under the administration of
Price Waterhouse given its inability to raise bank financing
last month.
