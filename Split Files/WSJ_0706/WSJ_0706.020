   ROME -- Italy's unemployment rate fell to 10.6% of the
labor force in April from 11.5% in January and from 11.9% a
year earlier, according to figures released yesterday by the
state statistical agency, ISTAT.
   The unemployment rate was still by far the highest in the
southern, so-called Mezzogiorno region, but even here the
jobless rate showed a significant decline. The southern
unemployment rate fell to 19.1% of the labor force in April
from 20.1% in January and from 21.3% a year earlier.
