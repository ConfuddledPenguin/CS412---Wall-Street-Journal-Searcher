   LOS ANGELES -- A shareholder sued Medco Research Inc.,
alleging the company misled investors into thinking it might
soon be sold.
   In a complaint seeking class-action status in federal
court here, Thomas Duffy also alleged that William C. Govier,
Medco executive vice president, sold 41,000 shares of the
company's stock at between $18 and $20 a share just before
share prices dropped sharply.

   Last November, Medco retained Oppenheimer &amp; Co. to advise
it on maximizing shareholder value through a possible sale.
No one expressed an interest in buying the Los Angeles-based
drug formula licensor, but Medco announced that several
companies were reviewing the possibility, the complaint said.
   Mr. Govier allegedly sold his shares between March 12 and
March 27 this year knowing that no one had expressed an
interest in acquiring Medco. The Medco share price dropped
$3.75 to $15.75 on March 30, the complaint said. Yesterday,
Medco was quoted at $9.75 bid over the counter, up 62.5 cents
from Friday.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Also named as
defendants are Mr. Govier; Manfred Mosk, Medco's chief
executive officer; and Sanford J. Hillsberg, the company's
general counsel.
   Neither Medco nor its officials named in the suit could be
reached for comment.
