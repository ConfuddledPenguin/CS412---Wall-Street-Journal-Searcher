   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Exxon Co. USA will spend $2.8
million to improve environmental safeguards at a refinery to
settle a lawsuit over the fouling of a New Jersey waterway,
officials said.
   Exxon Co. USA, based in Houston, is a division of New
York-based Exxon Corp.

   The settlement resolves allegations that Exxon violated
terms of its state waste-water discharge permit at its
refinery in Bayonne, which discharges into the Kill Van Kull
waterway.
   The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group and Friends
of the Earth filed the lawsuit in May 1989 in federal court
in Newark under the Clean Water Act, which provides for such
citizen action.
   Exxon, without any finding or admission of liability,
agreed to invest $2.8 million for "environmentally beneficial
mitigation projects" at the Bayonne facility, the public
interest group said.
   An Exxon spokesman said the agreement "demonstrates
Exxon's commitment not only to comply fully with all permit
requirements but also to take further responsible steps
designed to reduce or eliminate waste materials at their
source."
