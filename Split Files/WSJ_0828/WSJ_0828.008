   A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, granted a request by
American Airlines to prohibit United Airlines from making any
immediate changes to its flight schedules at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. American alleged that the planned
changes violated a federal agreement and would give United an
unfair advantage in Chicago.
   Judge John McBride issued a temporary restraining order
barring United, a unit of UAL Corp., Chicago, from changing
its schedules before the court can hold a full hearing on the
matter next Tuesday.

   Because of the high volume of traffic at O'Hare, the
federal government restricts the number of takeoffs and
landings per hour. As a result, the government in the past
has given United and American permission to coordinate their
flight schedules to ease delays and prevent overburdening the
air traffic control system.
   American, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, alleged that
United planned to move up the departure times of many of its
flights as of Oct. 1. American said that United had already
filed a notice stating its plans and that the changes would
put American at a competitive disadvantage.
   United called American's complaint "without basis in
fact." The carrier said it was only responding to changes
American had said it was planning to make in its Chicago
flight schedules as of Sept. 15. United also said the proper
forum for solving the dispute is the Federal Aviation
Administration, which regulates air traffic at O'Hare.
   The FAA could step in if it believed any of the changes
contemplated would result in worse delays or additional
problems for air traffic controllers. United and American are
the dominant airlines at O'Hare. United operates 729 flights
daily out of Chicago; American operates 581. Most of the
changes contemplated affected flights departing between 7
p.m. and 8 p.m.
