   Linda Pearson, a former flight attendant turned
consultant, is giving a roomful of 100 business travelers her
latest safety tip: Polyester can kill.
   In a plane crash, she says, polyester can melt on skin and
hamper a prompt escape. So she advises wearing cotton or wool
when flying. She also suggests bringing smoke hoods, wearing
seat belts snugly, and making frequent trips to the bathroom
-- because, she explains matter of factly, "a full bladder
can burst on impact."

   Ms. Pearson is giving a course on how to survive an
airline disaster -- a new and somewhat bizarre breed of
consulting. In seminars and books, a handful of specialists
explore the best ways to prepare for the worst. Some students
even go through eerie evacuations on mock-ups of planes,
complete with stage smoke and screaming flight attendants.
   So far, the tutelage hasn't attracted leisure travelers.
But businesses are taking a keen interest: J.C. Penney Co.,
Primerica Corp., and MCI Communications Corp. have used or
plan to hire these consultants to train some of their
executives and corporate jet crews. "We figure it gives us a
leg up in a disaster," says Milton Bickle, director of
aviation services for Primerica.
   But along with clients, the advice is attracting some
controversy. Critics think the consultants, who charge as
much as $1,600 a day, may be profiting from, or at least
preying on, paranoia, noting that on average there is only
one accident resulting in fatalities for every two million
U.S. flights. They also say some tips -- such as bladders
bursting -- are based more on theory than empirical evidence.
"Some of it is overkill," says Denis Day, a travel management
consultant in Oak Brook, Ill. Adds a spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, an airline trade group: "It may just
scare people more than anything else."
   Still, even skeptics say these specialists are addressing
some important safety issues. The flight attendants main
union, for example, has been pushing airlines to tell
passengers more about preparing for crashes. And there are
many cases of people perishing because of inadequate safety
education. In 1986, 23 people died on a smoking Air Canada
jet that made a forced landing in Cincinnati; many of the
victims sat in their seats instead of evacuating, whereas
most survivors had memorized exit locations.
   "Just having a plan worked out in your mind can make all
the difference in the world," says Ken Burton, president of
Stark Survival Co. in Panama City, Fla., which has trained
executives at more than a dozen companies.
   The training isn't for the squeamish. Students tend to
squirm in their seats when Mr. Burton explains how travelers
who don't wear seat belts properly (tight and around the hip)
can be sucked under the belt in a crash. Ms. Pearson, who has
set up a company in Dallas called SafeAir, gets similar
reactions when she describes how unrestrained babies can
become "deadly projectiles," or how hairspray can act as
lighter fluid for hair. Forget to remove a loose pen before a
crash, she adds, and it may "take off part of your face."
   Ms. Pearson says her lectures are meant to be dramatic.
"The shock of the information helps people to remember it,"
she says.
   But executives say the lessons, while memorable, can be
disturbing. "It gave me flashbacks to my days in Vietnam,"
says D.J. Downing, corporate travel manager for Phillips
Petroleum Co., who recently attended a seminar Ms. Pearson
gave before the National Business Traffic Association, a
trade group for corporate travel managers. But Mr. Downing
says he found the seminar useful.
   The training can also be scary. On a recent afternoon in a
hangar at Westchester County Airport in New York, Mr. Burton
shows five Primerica executives how donning a life vest the
wrong way can cost them their lives, because it won't inflate
properly. Then, he asks the five to crouch into brace
positions on board a parked corporate jet. Slowly, the cabin
fills with stage smoke. "Evacuate]" he yells.
   Even in these controlled conditions, there is panic. To
their dismay, the executives are so blinded by the smoke they
can't see their outstretched hands, and must crawl to find a
window exit. Opening the exit door turns out be tricky, too,
and the group takes more than five minutes to get out.
   Safety experts from the Federal Aviation Administration
and the National Transportation Safety Board haven't attended
any of the classes, but they have mixed reactions to the
concept. On the one hand, they say, most travelers are far
too lax about safety preparations; they ignore the briefing
sessions flight attendants give and rarely read the safety
cards. "I'm for anything that gets people to think in advance
about airline safety," says Tom McSweeny, an FAA deputy
director.
   But Mr. McSweeny doesn't think the traveling public needs
to go quite so far as some consultants suggest. Synthetic
clothes can melt, he says, but that's even rarer than plane
crashes. "I wear polyester when I fly all the time," he says.
   The programs are definitely not cheap: Mr. Burton charges
as much as $1,600 a day to train executives and corporate jet
crews, and a 20-minute video offered by Ms. Pearson costs
$495. There is a cheaper alternative: a book called "Just in
Case," by Daniel Johnson, president of Interaction Research
Corp., an Olympia, Wash., company that makes airline safety
cards. (Curiously, while the consultants say their business
is brisk, Mr. Johnson says his book has sold only 3,000
copies in five years.)
   If the Association of Flight Attendants has its way, the
airlines will be dispensing some of these tips for free. The
union argues that the safety briefing airlines give
passengers needs to have more details on such things as
operating exit doors, using oxygen masks and wearing life
vests. So far, the industry contends it's doing enough. "You
shouldn't have to take some class to learn about airline
safety," says Matt Finucane, safety director for the union.
"But the industry doesn't want to frighten people."
