   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co., continuing its
aggressive marketing, introduced what it called an improved
DeskJet computer printer model at its lowest price ever.
   The company said its DeskJet 500 will carry a list price
of $729 and will offer better performance than the two
DeskJet printers it replaces. The newer of those two printers
was introduced in May 1989 and lists for $995.

   The DeskJet uses a non-impact technique that results in
sharper print and quicker printing than inexpensive
dot-matrix printers, which are often criticized for the
quality of their printing. Hewlett-Packard makes its DeskJet
printers in the U.S., while Japanese and other overseas
manufacturers dominate the dot-matrix business.
   Analysts said the new printer, which is expected to retail
for less than $500, should steal business from dot-matrix
printers. "H-P is meeting an important price point," said
John Seybold, editor of Seybold's Report on Desktop
Publishing. "This is deliberately priced to take a very
significant share from dot-matrix printers."
   Hewlett-Packard will take in an estimated $1.4 billion in
revenue from computer printer sales this year. Besides
nonimpact printers, the company sells the more expensive
laser printers, which are credited with sparking a boom in
the publication of computer-produced documents and
newsletters.
