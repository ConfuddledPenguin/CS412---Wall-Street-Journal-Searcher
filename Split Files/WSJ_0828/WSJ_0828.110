   Scandinavian Airlines System said its group net income
before extraordinary items in the first half of 1990 skidded
to 369 million Swedish kronor ($64.2 million), from 593
million kronor in the year-earlier period. Revenue climbed 9%
to 15.2 billion kronor.
   The company, 50%-owned by the governments of Sweden,
Norway and Denmark, blamed the weaker results on increased
capital and operating costs. SAS said the current
international situation and uncertainty in the oil markets
make it difficult to assess the rest of the year. But the
company said the group's full-year operating results before
depreciation are expected to be in line with comparable 1989
figures. Pretax profit in 1989 plunged 38%, to 1.46 billion
kronor, on revenue of 21.2 billion kronor.

   In the latest six months, the airline's operating profit
fell to 128 million kronor, from 416 million kronor the year
earlier, due to investments in airplanes and computer
reservation systems, an expansion of the route network,
higher fuel prices and industrial disputes.
   The company's hotel subsidiary widened its operating loss
to 114 million kronor as a result of financing costs
associated with taking a 40% stake in Inter-Continental
Hotels Corp., SAS said.
