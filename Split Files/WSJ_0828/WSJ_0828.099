   The food situation in Iraq doesn't appear nearly as
desperate as first thought, U.S. officials say, but Iraq is
running into severe problems feeding its army in Kuwait.
   Three weeks after Iraqi troops rolled through Kuwait,
there are frequent reports of bedraggled Iraqi soldiers
demanding water, juice, bread and even gasoline at gunpoint
from Kuwaiti refugees fleeing across the desert.

   "We understand they're facing persistent shortages" of
essential supplies in some of the southernmost battalions,
said Brig. Gen. Rich Timons, assistant commander of the
Army's 82nd Airborne division, one of the first U.S. units to
arrive in the Mideast. Iraq's military "isn't accustomed to
sustaining {supply lines} over long distances," Gen. Timons
said in an interview. "That already may be showing up."
   Senior U.S. and Saudi military strategists are convinced
that such problems, if they become more widespread and
pronounced over the next few days or weeks, are bound to
demoralize Saddam Hussein's forces and become an increasingly
important factor in shaping the U.S.'s military response.
Gen. Timons said there already are signs of "some internal
conflict" in the Iraqi military, though he didn't elaborate.
   In Iraq, however, while the U.N.-backed embargo is
pinching, the summer harvests of wheat and barley were
decent. Iraqi farmers are in the midst of their corn harvest
and are about to begin harvesting rice. While both crops are
tiny by U.S. standards, they should help stave off famine in
a nation that imports more than 70% of its food.
   The result is that U.S. officials now believe that Iraq
will have enough wheat and rice for four months of normal
human consumption, and that rationing and belt-tightening
could stretch those supplies another month or so. In a pinch,
Iraqi bakeries could switch to barley, which is usually fed
to livestock, when they run out of wheat flour. Iraq has
enough barley stockpiled to last seven months, according to a
report by the U.S. agricultural attache in Baghdad.
   As for corn, there will be enough for one more cycle of
broiler production, the report projects. With the embargo
already cutting off imports of mutton and beef, Iraq faces
severe meat shortages as soon as the last batch of chickens
are eaten, probably within two months.
   Early in the Mideast crisis, U.S. officials were saying
that Iraq only has a two-month supply of wheat and
three-month supply of rice. In addition, Iraq was said to
have only enough barley to last one month and enough corn to
last less than two weeks. But that assessment, it turns out,
focused on grain stockpiles as of July 1, and didn't factor
in the summer harvests.
   The latest assessment comes amid mounting evidence that
the trade embargo is beginning to bite. Several ships
carrying grain and other foodstuffs to Iraq and to the
Jordanian port of Aqaba have been rerouted to other
destinations -- and other customers -- since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, according to grain-trade experts. "It's
remarkable how much everybody has come into line," said a
U.S. trade official. At the same time, U.S. officials are
receiving reports of bread lines and skyrocketing prices for
cooking oil, sugar and other commodities in tight supply in
Iraq.
   But it appears that the pinch of the economic sanctions
won't give way to widespread pain for many months. "I think
it might be a little too soon to have that effect all across
the country," said Christopher Goldthwait, a senior
Agriculture Department official. "There may be localized
shortages. It is in fact their harvest season."
   With Iraq on war-time footing, wheat and barley production
in Ninevah and other northern provinces may have fallen
somewhat short of projections by agricultural attache Larry
Panasuk.
   He forecasts a total wheat harvest of 800,000 metric tons
for 1990, up from last year's drought-shriveled 491,000 tons.
Coupled with 700,000 tons still in storage, that would meet
Iraq's wheat needs for four months.
   The flight of Egyptian and other foreign laborers who
customarily help out in Iraqi fields may hamper the corn and
rice harvests. But Mr. Panasuk projects a rice harvest of
166,000 tons, or about 25% of annual consumption. Combined
with Thai and U.S. rice stockpiled before the embargo, this
should be enough for four months, according to his report.
   The corn crop now coming in is projected at 110,000 tons,
far below of Iraq's annual needs of 820,000 tons. With
stockpiles virtually exhausted, the harvest will be only
enough to sustain one last burst of broiler production. Some
Iraqi broiler operations, anticipating the crunch, have begun
selling hatching eggs for human consumption.
   The Barley crop is estimated at one million tons. "In this
emergency, the Iraqis could reduce feeding of livestock and
use it for barley flour," one government official said.
   The Iraqi army's logistics system, however, faces new
stresses along the country's northern border, where Turkey
and Syria are said to have moved as many as 90,000 troops
closer to Iraqi positions. This will force Saddam Hussein to
move troops and "stretch out his supply lines to the
maximum," according to one U.S. official.
   But others worry that Iraq's staying power, honed during
its bloody war with Iran, will help keep its military intact
during this crisis. "They managed to last eight years against
the Iranians," said Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who runs the U.S.
Army's supply operation in Saudi Arabia.
   Efforts to disrupt Iraqi communications and supply lines
coincide with an important turning point in the largest U.S.
commitment of military might since the Vietnam War. With more
than 50,000 troops already in Saudi Arabia or on the way,
about that many more scheduled to leave during the next few
weeks, and hundreds of additional tanks slated to be deployed
shortly, the commanders of Operation Desert Shield now have
the firepower to begin thinking about possible offensive
moves.
   But many officers and soldiers here believe it's likely to
take weeks for the next phase of the operation to become
clear. "We're fundamentally in a training mode" to get
adjusted to the desert environment, said Gen. Timons, whose
airborne troops are trained for swift assault operations. "We
have no plans at this point to go into an offensive mode," he
said.
   That message was echoed by a contingent of U.S. senators
who visited troops and air crews during a three-hour stop at
a major air base in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   The eight lawmakers, including Senate Republican Leader
Robert Dole of Kansas and Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, emphasized the
importance of maintaining international support for the U.S.
operation in Saudi Arabia. "The mission here is to deter and
defend," Sen. Nunn told reporters. "It is very important that
we keep it in that context."
