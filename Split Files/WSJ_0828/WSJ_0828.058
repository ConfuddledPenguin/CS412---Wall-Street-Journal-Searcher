   American Glace's products complement the Steve's Homemade
lines of premium ice cream, marketed under the Steve's Super
Premium, Steve's Gourmet Light, and Swensen's brands, and
Heidi's frozen yogurt, said Gary P. Stevens, president of
Steve's Homemade. Steve's Homemade also franchises
restaurants and ice cream shops.
   Steve's Homemade recently reported a second-quarter net
loss of $86,000, or one cent a share, compared with net
income of $531,000, or four cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue fell 24% to $6.8 million from
$8.9 million. Officials have said, however, that they expect
third-quarter results to turn around.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Steve's Homemade
shares were quoted at $1.0625, unchanged.
