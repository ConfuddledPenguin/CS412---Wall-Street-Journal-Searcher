   HACKENSACK, N.J. -- Alpine Group Inc. said its agreement
to sell its General Plasma Inc. subsidiary to closely held
Ontario Corp., Muncie, Ind., was terminated.
   Alpine said Ontario Corp. couldn't arrange financing for
the purchase, which the companies definitively agreed upon
late last month. Alpine plans to pursue other expressions of
interest it has received regarding General Plasma, which
operates thermal spray coating systems used to coat
industrial parts.

   Alpine also has interests in information displays. Ontario
Corp. officials couldn't be reached for comment.
