   AUBURN, Ky. -- Retired high school teacher Helen Raby is a
Democrat. But she says she's backing Republican Sen. Mitch
McConnell for re-election because he wrote her a letter that
"sounded real personal."
   The typewritten missive expressed sympathy for the plight
of her husband, George, who is confined without insurance to
a nursing home near here. "It really appealed to me," she
says.
   Chalk up another vote to the power of incumbency. Though
Mrs. Raby is convinced the letter came from Mr. McConnell's
own hand, it was in fact drafted by his staff, and taxpayers
paid the postage. In hopes of winning converts like Mrs.
Raby, Sen. McConnell has spent nearly $2 million of
taxpayers' money over the past six years mailing letters all
over Kentucky.
   In terms of lawmaking, Mitch McConnell doesn't have much
to show for his six years in the Senate. By his own
admission, his chief legislative concerns are eclectic, and
have so far been unsuccessful. One is to limit plaintiffs'
rights in injury suits. Another is the GOP effort to alter
campaign-finance laws -- an enterprise Democrats disparage as
something less than reform.
   But in terms of using his office to cement the loyalties
of home-state voters and shake the political money tree, the
48-year-old senator is an acknowledged master. He has used
visits by high government officials, from the agriculture
secretary to the president, to attract campaign
contributions. He has dipped deeply into the pockets of
political-action committees, which strongly favor incumbents
over challengers. And he has kept his exposure in the state
high by meeting with constituents almost every weekend.
   Though he plays down many of these benefits, he
acknowledges: "I'd rather be an incumbent than a challenger."
   The result is likely to be good news for the senator come
November. Though Kentucky is normally an inhospitable state
for Republicans, Sen. McConnell is currently favored to win a
second term this year over his Democratic opponent, former
Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane, who hopes to make an issue of
the senator's use of his incumbency.
   "Politicians like McConnell are just looking after their
own self-interests as opposed to the public interest,"
contends Dr. Sloane, who is a physician. "I'm glad he's
exploited his office to such an extent. It makes him
vulnerable."
   But making that charge stick will be difficult --
ironically, because Mr. McConnell has been so skillful in
using his office to raise campaign funds. He is assured that
his own message of how he has looked out for Kentucky's
interest will be all over the airwaves.
   His first commercial this year was almost an unintentional
parody of the old Washington adage that there are two kinds
of lawmakers, workhorses and show horses. The TV ad, run
during this year's Kentucky Derby, brags that he prevented
the shutdown of his state's show-horse industry after a judge
raised questions about how the horses were being treated.
   His war chest also helps him make up for any legislative
shortcomings through sometimes questionable claims. One
commercial casts Sen. McConnell's as the deciding vote to
override the veto of a 1987 highway-construction bill that
President Reagan considered pork barrel, but which he asserts
was important to Kentucky. In fact, the deciding vote was
cast in a dramatic and widely reported fashion by Sen. Terry
Sanford (D., N.C.), who changed sides after an initial roll
call upheld the veto.
   Sen. McConnell learned many of the tricks of incumbency at
the expense of his predecessor. In 1984, he was the upset
winner over Democratic Sen. Walter Huddleston, an entrenched
but complacent incumbent who failed to persuade voters he was
anything but the "shadow senator" Mr. McConnell accused him
of being. The McConnell campaign ran commercials depicting
bloodhounds in search of the frequently absent senator.
   Once in office, Mr. McConnell took advantage of his new
position to spend almost every weekend for the next two years
holding town-hall meetings throughout the state -- more than
120 in all. He also chose wisely in coming out early for
then-Vice President George Bush for the 1988 GOP presidential
nomination, a gutsy move considering that Mr. Bush's chief
opponent was the Senate's Republican leader, Robert Dole of
Kansas. The risk paid off big when Mr. Bush chose to hold his
first fundraiser as president in Kentucky, collecting a state
record $1.3 million for Sen. McConnell's re-election bid.
   Sen. McConnell continues to play an insider's game by
bringing a parade of cabinet secretaries to Kentucky to make
speeches on his behalf, hold out the hope of special favors
and then wring campaign dollars from the starry-eyed locals.
So far, the secretaries of energy, agriculture, labor and
transportation have made the circuit.
   The senator makes much of these ties to top-ranking
Republicans and the president, and the voters know it. "He
and the president are like this," says Auburn farmer Robert
Earl Chyle, crossing his fingers.
   "The relationship does make a difference for Kentucky,"
Mr. McConnell asserts.
   Though Sen. McConnell is fighting to eliminate PACs as
part of campaign-finance revision, he is unembarrassed about
taking their money in the meantime. Over the years, he has
collected at least $1.1 million of PAC contributions, making
him one of 78 Senate million-dollar PAC recipients.
   Even the standoff with Iraq gives him a chance to cloak
himself in the establishment. During a tour of Dollar General
Corp. headquarters near here, he hugs the mother of a
serviceman dispatched to active duty in the Middle East, and
then promotes his reassurances during a radio interview soon
thereafter. "Our thoughts and prayers should be with the
Moore family," he says.
   At the Southern Kentucky Fair in Bowling Green, he and his
entourage attach "Stick with Mitch" stickers onto almost
every passer-by. One who stops to shake the senator's hand is
Larry Cole, a meter reader and owner of five show horses that
now compete thanks to the senator. "He sure has my vote," he
says.
