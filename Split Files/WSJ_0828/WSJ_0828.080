   London -- Earlier this year, the Royal Warrant Holders
Association, a select society of merchants that provide goods
and services to the royal family, regretfully announced that
Cartier could no longer be numbered among the firms that
display her majesty's coat of arms. A routine investigation
of the jewelers, a must for all Warrant holders once a
decade, revealed that the queen had not purchased a
sufficient quantity of baubles, bangles and beads for Cartier
to retain her Warrant.
   The news made headlines and raised eyebrows throughout the
land. A Cartier spokeswoman got right to the point: "This is
not something you take lightly."

   The royal demotion also created a gaggle of annoying
little expenses and inconveniences for Cartier. The large
relief of the queen's coat of arms, which had hung in front
of Cartier's elegant Bond Street shop for nearly three
decades, was taken down, and the crest removed from company
letter paper.
   Cartier, which provided many of the eyepopping bibelots
snapped up by the Queen's uncle the Duke of Windsor, is still
pretty royal, of course. The queen mother still shops there;
her stately coat of arms has replaced her daughter
Elizabeth's both at the front of the store and on Cartier
letterhead. And should QEII alter her shopping habits,
Cartier can again apply for a double entry in the
association, the organization Britons consider the ultimate
Better Business Bureau.
   Next year marks the 150th anniversary of the Royal Warrant
Holders Association, which, like cholesterol-enriched
breakfasts and the monarchy itself, is one of those uniquely
British institutions. Membership, which numbers between 850
and 900, is limited to manufacturers, suppliers and
individuals who provide goods and services to British
royalty's Big Four (the queen's husband, Prince Philip,
grants Warrants, as does Prince Charles).
   Members, all carefully vetted by the Lord Chamberlain's
office, range from the very simple to the downright grand.
Some are household words, particularly around plush
households (Rolls-Royce, Harrods, the tailors Gieves &amp; Hawkes
and gunsmiths James Purdy &amp; Son). Others are somewhat more
obscure (Southern Tree Surgeons, Lincolnshire Drainage Co.).
   Membership, not surprisingly, is heavy with rules. Warrant
holders can display the appropriate royal coat of arms in
subtle ways, such as on labels, shopping bags and delivery
trucks, as long as the image is small. But the minute you
hear an advertisement for the succulent raspberry preserves
the queen spreads on her toast each morning, you can safely
assume the association has just retired a member.
   The association also keeps an eye out for nonmembers who
brandish crests and adjectives like "royal" on their labels
and logos. It even keeps an attorney on retainer in the U.S.,
where many royal pretenders have surfaced over the years.
   Just what does a company gain by becoming a member of the
association? "Very little, except prestige," says Harold
Brooks Baker, editorial director of Burkes Peerage, the
163-year-old registry of the British aristocracy. Members get
to attend a special banquet each year, a tradition that goes
back 150 years, when members gathered to celebrate Queen
Victoria's birthday and the queen reciprocated by providing
venison for the main course.
   Current members also can see their names, and in some
cases their photographs, in the association's lavish new
coffee-table book, "By Appointment: 150 Years of the Royal
Warrant and Its Holders," by Tim Heald. The 336-page tome is
crammed with regal trivia. You learn that Rexel Business
Machines supplies the royal security shredders, that the
royal piper uses bagpipes made by Glasgow's R.G. Hardie &amp;
Co., and that a toothy lady named Kathy Pow is Warranted to
do the queen mum's royal nails.
   Though the association has been an official group only
since 1840, the notion of royal tradesmen stretches back
centuries. In 1155, the Weavers Company received a royal
charter from King Henry II, and by the time of Queen
Elizabeth I, records exist for royal purveyors of muttons,
"veales," "beeves" and fish. The ranks of official royal
tradesmen have always been exclusive. Though a palace
document from 1775 listed the Royal Rat Catcher and the Royal
Mole-Taker, it failed to credit the Royal Bug-Taker, an
oversight that caused one Andrew Cooke to complain that he
had successfully removed bugs from numerous royal beds.
