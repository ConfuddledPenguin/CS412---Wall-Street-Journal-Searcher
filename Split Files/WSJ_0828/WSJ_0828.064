   NEW YORK -- Mal Lowenthal seems to have landed on his
feet.
   The high-producing stockbroker, fired by Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. for calling the brokerage business "dirty" in
an article published in USA Today, was hired by Wertheim
Schroder &amp; Co.'s New York office.

   Mr. Lowenthal, in the Aug. 3 newspaper article, commented
on why there are so many complaints about brokers: "Because
this is a dirty business. Our product is money. And money
attracts scum." He also said a broker is a "dummy" if he
focuses only on his own firm's research ideas. Shearson, an
American Express Co. unit, said in response that Mr.
Lowenthal's views didn't "conform with the firm's philosophy
of quality service."
   Wertheim Schroder, by contrast, yesterday called Mr.
Lowenthal a "consummate professional" with a good record and
"an excellent group of clients." The firm said, "He shares
our philosophy of putting our clients' interests first."
