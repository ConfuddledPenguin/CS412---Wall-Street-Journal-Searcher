   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- First Chattanooga Financial Corp.
and BMR Financial Group Inc. said they agreed to terminate
BMR's planned $76 million acquisition of First Chattanooga.
   In February, BMR, a bank holding company based in Atlanta,
agreed to acquire First Chattanooga for cash and stock valued
at $27.25 a share. Yesterday, however, the two companies said
that instability in financial markets had made the
transaction less promising and that both companies had agreed
to end their agreement.

closed at $6 a share, unchanged.
   Separately, First Chattanooga, a thrift holding company,
said its board authorized an increase in the company's stock
repurchase program to $4 million from $1.5 million. First
Chattanooga has about 2.8 million shares outstanding.
