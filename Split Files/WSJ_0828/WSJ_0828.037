   The Bush administration had managed the Gulf crisis with
great skill, deploying a large military force in the region
and winning international backing for the use of weapons, if
necessary, to enforce the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq.
They've adeptly increased the pressure around Saddam Hussein.
But now the Bush team's backing for a "peace mission" to
Amman by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
mainly confuses matters.
   We wonder exactly what it is that Mr. Perez de Cuellar
plans to discuss Thursday with Tariq Aziz, Saddam's
smooth-talking foreign minister. A face-saving way for Saddam
to retreat from Kuwait? That doesn't begin to solve the Gulf
problem.

   The U.N. initiative runs the danger of muddling the point
of the entire Gulf undertaking. Yesterday, for instance, the
Bush folks in Maine were on various sides of Spin Street. On
the one hand there is Marlin Fitzwater saying "we are
pleased" with the U.N. effort, while the President himself
threw lukewarm water on it, saying he doubted that Saddam
would deal. But what if Saddam actually started to play the
U.N. card? Does Mr. Bush truly want to become bogged down in
some U.N.-sponsored "negotiation" with this character?
   The Gulf problem has a name: Saddam Hussein. George Bush's
initial instinct, that ridding the Middle East of Saddam
Hussein should be his minimum goal, was the correct one. If
the Iraqi survives this confrontation, he will simply lay low
for a while, building bigger rockets, concocting more poison
gas and working toward his most cherished goal, a nuclear
warhead.
   If removing Saddam still is the President's minimum goal,
what is there for the mild-mannered Secretary-General to
negotiate? He no doubt would win an amused smile from Tariq
Aziz if he demanded that Saddam Hussein step down. "Please,"
Tariq would say. "Do you think I'm foolish enough to carry
that message back to Baghdad? Saddam personally shoots people
for less."
   On the generous side, we suppose it's possible here that
the Administration is displaying its occasional tin ear in
matters of public perceptions. The most visible U.S. weekend
supporters of the Perez de Cuellar mission were National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and the State Department's
John M. Kelly. Mr. Scowcroft conducted his own poorly timed
goodwill mission last year, traveling to Beijing not long
after Deng Xiaoping and colleagues had killed several hundred
Chinese students and democrats in Tiananmen Square on the
night of June 4. Mr. Kelly is the Mideast expert who assured
Congress of Saddam's likely good behavior a few days before
the Iraqi sent his tanks rolling toward Kuwait City.
Embracing the U.N. mission just doesn't ring true in the
current context of events.
   Allied commanders say that forces are now in place to
punish Saddam in a way he understands, by destroying his air
force, his missiles, his tanks, his poison-gas factories and
his nuclear installations. After Saddam's generals and other
assorted accomplices are cleaned out, Iraq could be put under
the suzerainty of an Arab leader the West and Iraqis
themselves could trust. That means someone who does not
habitually murder Kurds and Shiites, threaten peaceful
neighbors or harbor terrorists who prey on Europe and Israel.
   Will military action against Hussein receive support from
the American people? As with all military actions against
tyrants, it will win support if it succeeds and if its
purpose is made clear. Successful actions against Moammar
Gadhafi, Castro-backed forces in Grenada and Manuel Noriega
in Panama were applauded. If the operation falls apart,
George Bush will be skewered by both his natural enemies and
frequent supporters. Events in the world often force
Presidents to take those kinds of risks. They are minor
compared with those his troops run. The odds this time are in
his favor.
   The alternative is to leave U.S. and British troops
sweltering in the desert while Mr. Perez de Cuellar shuttles
back and forth trying to do a deal with Saddam. High-tech
airplanes designed for such jobs as neutralizing the Iraqi
air force on the ground will be threatened by sandstorms and
corrosion. After Labor Day, Congress will return and start
compromising the Commander in Chief's authority. Mr. Bush
should not leave himself in that position.
