   Komatsu Ltd., Japan's top maker of contruction machines,
said it revised its sales and earnings projections upward for
the fiscal year ending March 31 because of
stronger-than-expected domestic demand.
   Komatsu officials said unconsolidated sales will total
about 690 billion yen ($4.7 billion), up from 660 billion yen
estimated last May, while pretax earnings will reach 50
billion yen, up from an initial 45 billion yen estimate.

   Profit is now seen at around 21.5 billion yen, only
slightly higher than 21 billion yen in the original
projection.
   Officials said their company is more bullish because of
unexpectedly strong domestic demand for construction and
industrial machinery that they said apparently reflects
sustained economic growth.
   Komatsu expects sales to amount to some 980 billion yen,
up from 950 billion yen estimated in May, while it sees
consolidated pretax and earnings at about 77 billion yen and
35 billion yen, respectively. Its previous projections called
for pretax earnings of 73 billion yen and profit of 34
billion yen.
