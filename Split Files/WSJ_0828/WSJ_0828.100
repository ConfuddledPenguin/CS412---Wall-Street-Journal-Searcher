   CRI Insured Mortgage Association Inc., a real estate
investment trust based in Rockville, Md., amended its plan to
acquire four mortgage investment partnerships managed by New
York-based Integrated Resources Inc.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, CRI said
it is proposing to swap cash plus shares of either CRI or a
new company it formed for all the units outstanding of the
four partnerships.

   Under the previous offer, the partnerships' unit holders
would have received only shares. Now CRI proposes to pay 10%
of the units' exchange value in cash and 90% in stock. CRI
said the plan must be cleared by the SEC and by holders of a
majority of CRI shares.
   Integrated, which is operating with protection from
creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code, manages investment partnerships. It has been fighting
the CRI offer because it would lose certain management fees
if the bid succeeds. This month, a plan under which
Integrated would sell its interests in the partnerships for
as much as $45 million to Krupp Cos. collapsed. Krupp is a
Boston-based real estate investment manager.
