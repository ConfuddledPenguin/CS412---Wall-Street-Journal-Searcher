   NEW YORK -- Bond prices soared yesterday in reaction to a
hefty decline in the price of oil and a sense that tensions
in the Mideast are abating.
   In active trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil futures for October delivery fell $4 a barrel to
close at $26.91.

   Even before oil prices started to fall, government bond
prices were rising around the world on relief that officials
in both the U.S. and Iraq have signaled a willingness to
negotiate an end to the Mideast crisis.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds climbed more than 1 1/2
points for a gain of more than $15 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, eased to 8.99% from 9.15% on Friday.
   Tax-exempt municipal bonds, high-grade corporates and
mortgage-backed bonds followed the Treasury market, posting
moderate to big gains. Most junk bonds, which were boosted by
rising stock prices, ended between 3/4 and one point higher
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 78.71 points to
end at 2,611.63. Junk bonds are speculative-grade bonds that
carry low ratings or no ratings at all.
   But bond market activity was very light yesterday. Traders
said that yesterday's rally may have been exaggerated by a
large number of speculators who were buying notes and bonds
to cover short sale positions. In a short sale, investors
sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities.
Essentially, these traders were betting that prices would
fall.
   "A lot of people had gone short into the weekend expecting
a major confrontation in the Middle East," said Elizabeth
Reiners, money-market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
But after nothing happened in the Middle East, "people who
were short had to come into the market and cover their
positions," she said.
   Fear that political turmoil in the Persian Gulf would
disrupt oil supplies and lead to spiraling prices and
inflation has haunted the bond market for weeks. Late last
week, war seemed imminent when Iraqi troops surrounded
foreign embassies in Kuwait and demanded that foreign
diplomats abandon the embassies.
   While yesterday's rally was welcomed by investors,
analysts warned that the market remains vulnerable to both
political and economic news.
   It was a busy day for new issues in the mortgage-backed
securities market. More than $3 billion of new real estate
mortgage investment conduit securities were offered.
   Yesterday's offerings included the first Remic ever
collateralized with Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. new Gold
PCs, or participation certificates.
   The $1 billion offering, through Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., is collateralized with Freddie Mac Gold 9.5%
participation certificates.
   Gold PCs reduce the delay between the time homeowners make
their monthly payments and the time investors get their
payments from Freddie Mac to 45 days from 75 days on the
regular PCs. By October, all new PCs issued by Freddie Mac
will be Gold PCs.
   The remaining three offerings, all Federal National
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Remics, were priced late
last week and unveiled publicly yesterday.
   The issues were a $1 billion offering in Series 1990-119
in 15 classes through Goldman, Sachs & Co.; a $563 million
issue in Series 1990-117 in 10 classes through Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. and a $500 million offering in Series 1990-120
in 12 classes through PaineWebber Inc., backed by Fannie Mae
9% securities.
   Heavy new Remic issuance had been expected. Last week, the
mortgage-securities market outperformed the Treasury market,
as dealers sought collateral for the new Remic offerings. The
incentive to issue Remics increases when the yield curve
steepens, as it did last week.
   The bulk of Remic offerings are short-dated instruments,
so it becomes more attractive to underwrite these issues at
times when short-term rates are falling faster than long-term
yields.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were sharply higher in
light trading activity.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 97 13/32 to
yield 8.99% compared with 95 26/32 to yield 9.15% on Friday.
The latest ten-year notes ended at a price of 99 4/32 to
yield 8.86% compared with 98 2/32 to yield 9.03%. Two-year
notes ended at 99 21/32 to yield 8.17% compared with 99 15/32
to yield 8.28%.
   The Treasury sold a total of $18.49 billion of short-term
bills yesterday at its regular weekly auction.
   The average discount rate on the three-month bills was
7.49%, down from last week's auction when the average rate
was 7.55%. But the rate for six-month bills at yesterday's
auction was 7.48%, which was slightly higher than the 7.45%
rate at last week's auction.
   Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell $11.5 billion of
two-year notes and tomorrow the Treasury will sell $8.5
billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading activity,
the yield on the two-year notes was quoted late at 8.16%
while the yield on five-year notes was quoted at 8.54%. Here
are details of yesterday's short-term bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Aug. 30. The 13-week bills mature
Nov. 29, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 28, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds took their cue from the stock market and
advanced as some shortcovering by dealers pushed the market
higher.
   "I think the dealers took the market down and the dealers
are taking the market back up," said David Briggs, senior
trader at Federated Investors Corp., which manages mutual
funds. "We are just basically getting whipsawed by dealers."
   Junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., which lost ground most of
last week, staged a partial rebound.
   RJR Nabisco's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, rose 1 1/2 points to 108 3/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind issues pay interest in the form
of additional securities. The company's 17% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended 1 3/4 points
higher at 83 3/8.
   Deferred-interest bonds, which are highly volatile, were
the biggest gainers yesterday.
   American Standard Inc.'s zero-coupon subordinated
debentures gained two points to close at 52 while RJR's
zero-coupon subordinated debentures added 1 3/4 points to end
at 46 1/4.
   Other gainers: Duracell Holdings Corp.'s 13.125% senior
subordinated notes chalked up one point to end at 101 while
Kroger Co.'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures advanced
one point to close at 101.
   These bonds, which rank in the top tier among junk bonds,
were relatively unscathed during last week's bout of selling.
However, market participants said that when the broader
market appeared to firm, investors started scrambling to buy
these better-quality names at Friday's prices.
   Meanwhile, junk bonds of Stone Container Corp. shrugged
off news of a credit-rating downgrade from Moody's Investors
Service Inc. Stone Container's 11.50% senior subordinated
notes finished up 3/4 point at 84 3/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Moody's said it downgraded the rating of Stone Container's
$350 million issue of 13.625% subordinated notes, due 1995,
to single-B-3 from Ba-3; and the rating of the company's $200
million issue of 11.5% senior subordinated notes to
single-B-2 from Ba-3.
   In addition, the credit agency said it assigned a
single-B-1 rating to the company's forthcoming junk-bond
issue.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds also posted gains, but lagged the U.S.
Treasury market. Intermediate-term corporate bonds gained 1/2
point while long-term corporate bonds advanced 3/4 point, on
average.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   The decline in oil prices helped municipal securities,
which closed as much as 1 3/8 points higher.
   Among actively traded issues, the price of the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 climbed 1 3/8
points to 97 1/8.
   Despite the price increases, activity during the session
was dominated by dealers and short sellers covering their
positions.
   Traders remain skeptical about whether the market will
climb much higher this week, focusing on the Mideast
situation.
   "I think people would just rather wait and just do nothing
because one change in circumstance in the Middle East could
turn things around," said one trader.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   In the secondary market for mortgage securities, prices
rose on the drop in oil prices.
   Among actively traded issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues for September delivery were up 23/32
at 98 6/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues for
September delivery were up 22/32 at 97 25/32, and Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were up 22/32 at 98
10/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds

   Prices of most foreign government bonds ended higher
yesterday, although dealers in many markets said that
yesterday's rebound was not the start of a new bullish trend.
   In Japan, bonds were helped by a stronger yen, talk that a
large securities firm was supporting the market and
aggressive intervention in the money market by the Bank of
Japan.
   Through several operations, the central bank added 1.4
trillion yen ($9.57 billion) to the market. Before the
central bank intervention, the overnight unsecured call money
rate was bid as high as 7 24/32%, but after the operations
the rate dropped to 7 18/32%.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year bonds was quoted at
82.64, up 0.37 point, to yield 8.2%. (Foreign bond yields are
quoted here in local terms and therefore differ somewhat from
yields calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms,
which tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare
yields across markets. Using that method, the yield on
Japan's No. 119 bond ended at 7.53%, according to Salomon
Brothers Inc.)
   In Paris, French government bonds gained about one point,
with the market taking some encouragement from easing tension
in the Middle East. Dealers said short-covering by
professionals also lifted prices, especially at the longer
end.
   "We get to the point that the French market starts to look
cheap vis-a-vis the German market, and that always brings in
some buyers," said a Paris-based dealer.
   Among French Treasurys, the 8.5% bond due 2000 ended 0.81
point higher at 89.53 to yield 10.26%.
   The French rally helped fuel a 0.55 point rise in West
German bond prices.
   But aside from a flurry of buying out of the Far East,
turnover was light, dealers say. Activity also was curtailed
by a bank holiday in London, which closed the London
International Financial Futures Exchange and the Bund future
contract.
