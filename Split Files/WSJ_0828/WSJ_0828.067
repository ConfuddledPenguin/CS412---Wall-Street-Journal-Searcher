   VLSI Technology Inc., San Jose, Calif., said it expects to
report a loss and lower revenue for the third quarter.
   The semiconductor maker said the loss will mainly be the
result of a decision to withdraw from a segment of the
memory-chip business. It said the withdrawal from the static
random-access memory business will result in a one-time
charge to operations of $12 million to $15 million against
third-quarter results.

   VLSI also said it will lay off about 100 of its 2,000
employees between now and the end of the quarter.
   Revenue is running below expectations because of declines
in demand for older products, VLSI said.
