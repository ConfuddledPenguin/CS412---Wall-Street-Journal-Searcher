   An investor group including Leonard M. Ross, Merri Jean
Ross, and RRH Capital Management Inc. said it intends to
nominate slates for election of trustees and directors of
Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp.
   Hotel Investors Trust is a real estate investment trust
based in Los Angeles whose shares are paired for trading with
Hotel Investors Corp. in San Diego. The companies are in the
process of selling most of their assets.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the investors said they believe that current managers have
failed to maximize shareholder value.
   "We disagree with the allegations and will file complete
proxy materials to respond more fully," said a spokesman for
the two companies. The companies' annual meeting is set for
Sept. 24.
   The investors said they also intend to propose the repeal
of the recent amendments to the by-laws and regulations of
the companies which they said are designed to restrict
shareholders' ability to make proposals and nominate
opposition candidates.
   Mr. Ross and his wife own a 7.6% stake in the two
companies. RRH Capital Management, an investment concern,
owns 6.3%.
