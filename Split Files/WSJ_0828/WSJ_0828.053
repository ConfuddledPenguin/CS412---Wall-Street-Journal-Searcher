   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said that for the 1991
model year, it will triple the number of its U.S.-built cars
equipped with driver-side air bags as standard equipment.
   The No. 1 auto maker, which has lagged behind rivals
Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in offering standard air
bags, said it expects to sell about 1.3 million cars equipped
with air bags during the 1991 model year that begins Oct. 1.
The bags will be offered as standard equipment on 21 car
lines, the company said.

   So far this model year, GM has sold about 450,000 cars
equipped with driver-side air bags. That represents only
about one-seventh of the auto maker's current annual U.S. car
production. The bags are now offered as standard equipment on
13 car lines and as an option on two others.
   "Customers have indicated that they like the air bag, and
therefore we will put them on," a GM spokesman said.
   The No. 1 auto maker appears now to be stepping up
production of air bag-equipped cars as a reaction to
increasing competition and consumer demand.
   Within hours of GM's announcement, Chrysler Corp. released
a statement announcing its plan to roll its one-millionth air
bag-equipped car off the assembly line. Chrysler was the
first of the Big Three to offer air bags as standard
equipment on all its domestically built cars.
   Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, said driver-side bags are
standard equipment on nine of its U.S. car lines accounting
for about 45% of its product line. By the mid-1990's, Ford
said it will offer driver-side and passenger air bags on all
U.S. cars.
   The major Japanese auto makers also have been slow to
introduce air bags on their high-volume cars, preferring
instead to offer automatically fastening seat belts.
   Federal law requires that all cars be equipped with
so-called "passive restraints." Auto makers have a choice
between offering automatically fastening seat belts, or
installing driver-side air bags that inflate during a crash
to cushion the driver from the force of impact.
   GM said that for 1991, it will offer standard air bags for
the first time on three of its highest-volume car lines: the
Chevrolet Corsica, Beretta and Caprice. In addition, GM said
the Buick Park Avenue, Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon,
Oldsmobile Eighty-eight and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Wagon
will also come with air bags as standard equipment for 1991.
   GM said virtually all of its U.S.-built cars will have air
bags by the fall of 1995. Additionally, the auto maker said
it will add passenger-side air bags in more cars for the 1992
model year.
