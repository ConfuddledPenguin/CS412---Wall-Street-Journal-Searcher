   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Oracle Systems Corp. said its
review of certain revenue transactions has not resulted in
any restatement of either revenue or net income for its year
ended May 31.
   However, the company said the review has resulted in
restatements of the quarterly results for the fiscal year. It
said the changes result from "the company's determination
that a portion of revenue and related sales expenses reported
in some fiscal quarters should have been recognized as
revenue and expenses in different periods."

   The announcement by Oracle, which makes computer software,
came after the close of trading yesterday. A spokeswoman
declined to elaborate on the terse prepared statement.
   Oracle posted record revenue of $970.8 million and net of
$117.4 million, or 86 cents a share, for fiscal 1990. But in
recent months, the company's marketplace success -- it sells
popular database software for minicomputers and mainframes --
has been partly obscured by concern over its accounting
methods.
   In March, the company cited an accounting glitch as the
reason for lower-than-expected revenue in its third quarter.
The day after the announcement, the company's stock fell 31%
on record-breaking volume for a single over-the-counter
issue.
   As restated, Oracle's revenue was unchanged for its first
quarter. Revenue totaled $209 million for the second quarter,
compared with $224.6 million originally reported. For the
third quarter, revenue totaled $245.6 million, compared with
$236.4 million reported. For the fourth quarter, revenue
totaled $340.8 million, compared with $334.4 million.
   As restated, Oracle's net was unchanged for the first
quarter. For the second quarter, net was $19 million,
compared with $28.5 million reported. For the third quarter,
net was $29.8 million, compared with $24.3 million. For the
fourth quarter, net was $56.8 million, compared with $52.9
million.
