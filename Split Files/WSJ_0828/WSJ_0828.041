   CHICAGO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing lack of
growth in demand for containerboard products, said it lowered
its ratings on about $550 million in debt issued by Stone
Container Corp.
   The rating concern said "overcapacity and declining
prices" in the containerboard market will mean that Stone's
"internal cash generation will be insufficient to allow for
meaningful debt reduction this year or next."

   Moody's said that "rising containerboard capacity, against
a no-growth demand background, is producing overcapacity and
declining prices." This, Moody's said, could reduce Stone's
internal cash generation below the level of its capital
spending in 1990 and 1991, allowing the company, the largest
containerboard producer in the country, to reduce its debt
only by selling assets.
   The production facilities that Stone operates are more
expensive to run than those of its main competitors, Moody's
said, and "significant investment" is needed to bring
production costs down.
   Moody's downgraded $350 million in 13.625% subordinated
notes, due 1995, to single-B-3 from Ba-3, and $200 million in
11.5% senior subordinated notes to single-B-2 from Ba-3.
   Arnold Brookstone, Stone senior vice president and chief
financial officer, disputed Moody's assessment. "We believe
that the containerboard industry is not operating in a
no-growth demand background," he said. "It's our opinion that
linerboard today is in a relatively tight supply-demand
relationship, and whatever new capacity is coming on is being
absorbed without difficulty."
   Mr. Brookstone said: "We feel there is an excellent
opportunity for prices in linerboard to be going up rather
than declining. Prices are due to increase overseas, and we
hope that will be a prelude to price increases domestically."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Stone shares closed at $13.125, up 37.5 cents.
