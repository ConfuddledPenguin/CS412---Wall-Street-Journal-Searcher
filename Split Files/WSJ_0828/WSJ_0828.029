   BOISE, Idaho -- Albertson's Inc. reported net income
increased 16% to $52.9 million, or 40 cents a share, for its
second quarter ended Aug. 2.
   Sales rose 14% to $2.07 billion, although year-earlier
results were slightly depressed by a strike by workers at 34
of its stores in the Seattle, Wash., area. The company
estimated that sales would have increased by only 7.7% if the
strike had not occurred.
