   Trefoil Capital Investors L.P. said it signed a definitive
agreement with CNC Holding Corp. for Trefoil's previously
announced purchase of CNC's 82% stake in Child World Inc.
   Terms of the non-cash transaction haven't been disclosed.
Earlier this month, doubts were raised about the transaction
when Trefoil announced that the planned signing of a
definitive agreement with CNC had been postponed.

   Trefoil, based in Burbank, Calif., was formed by the
executives of Shamrock Holdings Inc., a holding company
controlled by Roy E. Disney. CNC is a Cleveland-based holding
company. Child World is an Avon, Mass., toy retailer.
   Trefoil said it also signed an agreement for its plan to
purchase the 18% of Child World now in public hands for $14 a
share, or $28 million.
   Trefoil said both transactions have been approved by Child
World's board. The transaction with CNC is expected to be
completed on or about Nov. 19, and the Child World
acquisition is expected to be completed about 90 days later,
Trefoil said.
