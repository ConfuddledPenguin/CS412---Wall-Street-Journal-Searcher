   LONDON -- The longest-running financial scandal of the
Thatcher era neared a conclusion as a London jury convicted
the former chairman of Guinness PLC and three co-defendants
of charges arising from the company's 1986 takeover of
Distillers Co.
   After a three-year investigation and a trial of more than
100 days, a Southwark Crown Court jury found former Guinness
Chairman Ernest Saunders, 55 years old, guilty of 12 of 13
charges against him. Mr. Saunders, who resigned from Guinness
in 1987 after the scandal broke, allegedly conspired to
inflate the company's stock price to help win its #2.53
billion ($4.91 billion) bid, made in late 1986, for
Distillers, a Scottish spirits company.

   Mr. Saunders's son, James, said his father plans to
appeal.
   Much like the separate U.S. proceedings against arbitrager
Ivan Boesky and "junk bond" king Michael Milken, in Britain
the Guinness Affair -- as it was called -- came to symbolize
the excesses of the 1980s bull market and economic
prosperity. As the investigation dragged on and targeted a
few big Conservative Party contributors, the case also became
a political embarrassment to the Conservative government of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The guilty verdict, though nearly four years in the
making, will enhance the oft-tarnished reputations of British
financial regulators. After the scandal broke, Mrs.
Thatcher's government accelerated adoption of a broad series
of reforms in U.K. legislation on financial crime, insider
trading and corporate law. The Guinness case was the most
far-reaching undertaken by the government's new white-collar
crime squad. And in London's financial district, it became a
major test of the government's mettle.
   "It is an important case because it demonstrates the
authorities' intention to prove that the new legislation . .
. actually sticks and is made to work," said Peter Smith,
partner in charge of the London office of management
consultants Coopers Lybrand Deloitte.
   "Had there not been a guilty verdict, it might have been
open house for quite a lot of undesirable practices" in
London's financial district, Jonathan Guinness, a former
Guinness director, told the British Broadcasting Corp. A
spokesman for the London-based spirits company, which was
never implicated in any of the charges, declined to comment.
   But the case was hardly a resounding victory for British
prosecutors or the legal system. The criminal inquiry didn't
get very far until some help came in 1987 from the U.S.,
where investigators found a link between the Guinness and
Boesky cases.
   Even then, the trial's start was repeatedly delayed, and a
mistrial was declared after some jurors pleaded that they
couldn't withstand what promised to be a six-month hearing.
And the trial that ended yesterday, after six days of jury
deliberations, is only the first of two: Mr. Saunders and
three other defendants are expected to go on trial in October
on related charges.
   Mr. Saunders, who now claims to be impoverished, faces a
maximum penalty of 90 years in prison from yesterday's jury
verdict. His sentencing is scheduled for today.
   Convicted along with Mr. Saunders on the conspiracy
charges were British financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, and Gerald
Ronson, 50, chairman of Heron International PLC, a big
British property concern. A fourth defendant, stockbroker
Anthony Parnes, 45, was found guilty of false accounting and
theft charges. Sir Jack faces a maximum penalty of 45 years
in prison; Mr. Ronson, 31 years, and Mr. Parnes, 68.
   The charges all stem from the tactics Mr. Saunders and his
colleagues used to ensure Guinness's victory in the 1986
takeover battle for Distillers. By the then-decorous
standards of British takeover fights, the Guinness contest
against rival bidder Argyll Group PLC was unusually nasty.
Under Mr. Saunders, the once-sleepy Guinness company in the
1980s had embarked on a spending spree to become a global
force in the brewing and spirits business.
   Because both Guinness and Argyll were offering their own
shares for Distillers, the success of the takeover battle
depended partly on how well Guinness and Argyll shares
performed on London's stock exchange. During the trial,
prosecutors alleged that Mr. Saunders and colleagues tried to
inflate Guinness's share price.
   Among other things, prosecutors said he authorized payment
of #5.8 million to Mr. Ronson, partly to indemnify him
against losses on the #25 million of Guinness stock that he
bought.
   The prosecutors also alleged that Sir Jack received a fee
of #3 million from Guinness, and Mr. Parnes #3.4 million, for
their help in arranging the illegal share-support scheme. The
defendants maintained that the payments were normal business
transactions.
