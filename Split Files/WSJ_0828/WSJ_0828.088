   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Peter Kolokouris, former president of
North Atlantic Fisheries Inc. here, was sentenced to a
$10,000 fine and five years of probation in U.S. District
Court here.
   Mr. Kolokouris had pleaded guilty to filing a false tax
return and filing a false statement with regulators about the
company's initial public offering.

   Mr. Kolokouris, appearing before federal Judge Michael
Telesca, faced a sentence of as much as 13 years in prison
and $110,000 of fines, said Charles M. Pilato, assistant U.S.
attorney in charge of the case.
   In June, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Mr.
Kolokouris settled a lawsuit filed against him by the
Securities and Exchange Commission by giving up a total $2.1
million of stock in North Atlantic and three other companies.
That suit charged that the executive had a secret ownership
interest in the company's underwriter and that he received
kickbacks from the underwriter.
   John Parinello, attorney for Mr. Kolokouris, said his
client had helped to initiate the civil settlement and that
this cooperation was reflected in the outcome of the criminal
proceeding.
   The criminal and civil charges both were filed in June
1989. The civil settlement also bars Mr. Kolokouris for five
years from being an officer, or owning 5% or more, of any
public company.
   North Atlantic Fisheries, a fish processor, is being
overseen by a court-appointed receiver.
