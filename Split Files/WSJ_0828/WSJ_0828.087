   Last Thursday Stuart Lockwood, aged five, stood straight
and brave and calm for all the world to see. Dressed in blue
soccer shorts and a white shirt, arms crossed firmly in front
of his chest, the English boy seemed to be staring past the
burly man in the business suit sitting in a chair next to
him. Maybe he was looking at his mother, who was among the 26
or so other hostages and the military officers in the room
where the cameras were working.
   The man talked to Stuart and as he was talking his big
left hand for a moment gently took hold of the boy's right
arm by the elbow, then stroked his hair. Stuart stood, his
face quiet, and let Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq, talk
to him and touch him. A man sitting off to the side repeated
the president's words in English so Stuart and all the rest
of us would understand them. Stuart couldn't have known what
sort of being Saddam Hussein is, only that he was dangerous.

   In the next few days the picture of Stuart standing there
so alone would enter our minds many times from television and
from newspapers. What was said is fading, but Stuart stays --
like the young man halting the column of tanks in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in June last year, like John-John Kennedy
saluting his father's coffin, like other such pictures; we
each have our own.
   Stuart didn't jerk his arm or his head away when Saddam
Hussein put his hand there; he didn't move even a little. His
small body said clearly it didn't want to be touched but
Stuart let it be touched. You could see he was tense, but not
if he was afraid, which he must have been. How did he know to
stay so calm? I think it was a woman who told him, probably
his mother, or an older sister or an aunt or a neighbor, but
almost certainly a woman. In the days and hours before those
cameras were set up and the bright lights turned on in that
room somewhere in Iraq, I think that woman talked to Stuart
quietly, with no panic in her voice, about the mad and deadly
world they had suddenly landed in and that she wanted them to
come out of alive.
   That "mad world" was just here for a while, she would have
said, and promised the world Stuart knew would come back
again. One day everybody would be happy once more. But now,
she had to talk to him about things to do with right now; and
if she repeated herself he should be patient because she
wanted him to clearly understand what she said and to
remember it.
   I may be wrong, but I think women are often better than
men at teaching the calmness, courage and common sense it
takes to live through brutal times, especially to children.
Is it that women at such times are able to think more about
the person they're trying to reach than about themselves? Are
they able to give their words such exactness, fit them so
perfectly, that the words become the other person's own?
   When I was about seven, a bit older than Stuart, I began a
three-and-half-year stay in Japanese prison camps. I lived in
what is now Indonesia, on the island of Java, in the city of
Bandung, in a small house my mother, my older brother, Jerry,
and I shared with three other Dutch families. Around one part
of the city they had built a high bamboo fence topped with
barbed wire and 5,000 of us lived inside the fence. The camp
was guarded by soldiers with rifles with bayonets on the end
and they would only let you out if you were extremely sick
(that was in the early days) or dead. The place was called
Bloemenkamp, which means Camp of Flowers, and it held women,
girls and small boys. Men and older boys were in other
prisons far away; my father was in one of those and in about
a year, when Jerry turned 12, he would be trucked to one
also.
   The three of us lived in what used to be a storage room,
with one mattress for my mother and one for Jerry and me, and
a wooden box that was our table. During the day my mother and
Jerry worked for the soldiers, in the vegetable gardens, the
kitchen, the above-ground sewers; I was still too young to
work and, as there was no school, I played all day.
   In the evening the three of us would sit around the box,
on which burned a smokey oil lamp. We would talk in low
voices for only a little while because the days were hot and
long and my mother and Jerry needed their sleep. We would
talk about what happened that day and about "the old days"
when we had lots of eggs and fruit salad. We could see each
other's eyes shine. Jerry and I did most of the talking and
my mother listened. She was very good at that and still is.
Sometimes, though, she would insist on speaking and often she
was serious then. You could tell because her lips grew thin.
   I remember one such time among many: I had told a story of
an adventure I'd had that day with a well-known guard called
Jantje Tomaat (Johnny Tomato). He had this name because, as
he patrolled the camp on his bicycle, he would keep an eye
out for edible tomatoes in the little vegetable plots
prisoners were still permitted. If he spotted a red one, he'd
jump off his bike, pluck it and eat it on the spot. It was
foolish to let your tomatoes ripen on the plant. That day he
picked a tomato in the front yard of the people across the
street. He saw me looking at him eating it, and I quickly
straightened my shoulders and bowed from the waist as was the
rule.
   Jantje Tomaat grinned at me and swung onto his bike -- it
was known that he liked little kids. I watched him slowly
ride down our street and then, just before he reached the
corner, there was a woman who either hadn't bowed quickly or
deeply enough, or maybe he didn't like her face. Anyway,
Jantje Tomaat got off his bike and holding the steering wheel
in the middle with his left hand walked yelling up to the
woman who was still bowed forward and rammed the front wheel
between her legs and hit her with the flat of his right hand
many times on the sides of her head, on her ears, until she
crumpled onto the road. Then he climbed back on his bike and
pedalled around the corner.
   I ran over to where the woman lay. Two women who'd also
seen what happened were carefully helping her sit up. Her
head was wobbling, her eyes stared, not even crying.
   My mother had listened and then, lips thin, she spoke
slowly, as she had done before and would again: "They are
your enemy. Always remember that. They have guns and they are
dangerous. They don't like you, even if they smile at you.
They don't like any of us. We are their enemy and if we
disobey them or get in their way they will kill us. Always be
polite, always be serious, always stay calm. Don't laugh,
don't smile, don't joke. You may lie if something in you
tells you that you must. I am afraid and I know that you are
afraid. But you'll be less afraid if you remember what I'm
telling you."
   We don't know what the words were that helped Stuart
Lockwood stand so brave those few moments in his life, but at
the heart of danger clearly the right words spoke to him.
