   NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER, Saudi Arabia -- Saddam Hussein has
hundreds of powerful tanks poised to attack, but many of the
heavy U.S. tanks are still chugging their way here by ship.
U.S. troops don't even have a dependable hand-held antitank
weapon; one under development may be available in a few
years.
   If a war starts, U.S. ground troops will be dependent on
the protection of helicopters noted for performing poorly in
harsh Third World weather conditions. Much of remaining
hardware badly needed by U.S. forces is still weeks away from
delivery. The Navy has too few cargo ships, and many are just
too slow.

   The U.S. military is a lumbering beast slouching toward
the Middle East. It doesn't have enough airlift capacity. Its
heavy tanks are too heavy to be moved easily; the Sheridan
light tanks, which can be airlifted, date from the 1960s.
"The threat remains very high," says Brig. Gen. Turki bin
Nasser, commander of a major Saudi air base. Until additional
forces are deployed, he says, the Iraqis "could go on the
offensive at any time."
   No one is suggesting that Saddam Hussein or anyone else
could overrun the U.S. military, which, in terms of total
firepower (and especially air power) remains incomparably
more powerful. Capitalizing on aircraft carriers and a
gigantic aerial refueling operation, the Pentagon poured in
an impressive force of more than 300 frontline jet fighters
in a matter of days.
   But planners for the Joint Chiefs of Staff are counting
the hours until specially built cargo ships will disgorge
hundreds of tanks and other weapons to shore up U.S. ground
positions in Saudi Arabia. The monumental military buildup of
the 1980s, in which defense spending doubled, was intended to
meet the threat of a well-known, monolithic Soviet enemy.
Now, the Cold War is fading -- and much of the buildup in
Europe is to be brought home.
   Overall, the mighty U.S. military isn't designed for
fighting in this Middle Eastern desert or in many of the
other Third World hot spots where war is most likely to
erupt. Along the India-Pakistan frontier, for example, where
two of the world's largest armies and most bitter enemies are
arrayed, similar logistical problems would hamper U.S.
military involvement. The same would be true if the U.S. were
suddenly dragged into a war in the politically volatile
deserts of Africa or jungles of South America.
   The shortcomings of today's military are only part of the
problem. Defense experts generally agree on a wide range of
reforms that the U.S. must begin right away, but the
political and military bureaucracies are getting in the way.
Congressional logrolling, bitter service rivalries and
massive bureaucratic inertia are the enemies of military
preparedness, blocking reforms that are desperately needed to
prepare the military for the 1990s and beyond.
   "The services are defending budget priorities that simply
have been overtaken by events," says Jacques Gansler, a
prominent defense analyst. Democratic Rep. Les Aspin,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, adds that the
U.S. "is still shaping and sizing our forces on the Soviet
threat," blocking the transformation of the military into a
smaller, more agile force with a "much quicker reaction
time."
   The longtime polarization of the defense-spending debate
in stark left-vs.-right terms is a big part of the problem.
Hawks, convinced that almost any significant Pentagon cuts
will decimate U.S. readiness, continue staunchly defending
Star Wars anti-missile research, the B-2 Stealth bomber and
the breakneck modernization of the nation's nuclear arsenal
-- all designed to meet a Soviet threat that is waning.
Doves, meanwhile, insist on fast and deep cuts in Pentagon
expenditures, resisting the kind of difficult choices
necessary to reshape Pentagon priorities.
   The White House insists the crisis means the U.S. must
maintain a big defense budget. "I think it means just the
opposite," Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska
countered Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. While the U.S. has
been building up for a big land war in Europe, "the first
post-Cold War crisis has occurred in the Middle East," he
said. "Our military strategy has to be evaluated."
   The Mideast conflict, erasing any doubt about the kind of
changes the military must make, is "likely to establish the
type of forces that will be required for the rest of the
decade," says Gen. Edward Meyer, a retired Army chief of
staff.
   But even if the military adapts, the political structure,
a labyrinth of special interests overlaid with a cumbersome
committee structure on Capitol Hill, may not evolve so
readily. Despite Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait, "the
politics of cutting the defense budget have changed only
slightly," Rep. Aspin says.
   Just what kind of a force do the 1990s demand? How should
the U.S. shift its focus away from a powerful, monolithic
enemy toward a diversity of smaller -- though highly
dangerous -- threats? And, just as important, what obstacles
are blocking the path of reform? Following are some of the
broad areas in which government, industry and other defense
planners see the need for change, and some of the factors
standing in the way.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. land forces must become lighter, more mobile and more
versatile.
   Although the situation in Saudi Arabia might make this
seem painfully obvious, it is hardly a novel concept. One of
the fathers of the light-forces philosophy is Robert Komer,
the Pentagon's senior policy official during the Carter
administration. As a young aide to President Kennedy in the
1960s, he persuaded the U.S. to lease Diego Garcia, a
strategically located island in the Indian Ocean, to provide
a jumping-off point for U.S. forces to potential trouble
spots in the region. It turned out to be a godsend in the
present crisis: The first wave of heavy armor to reach here,
Marine M-60 tanks, came from that island. In crises like the
present one, "We have a military that is much larger than one
we could get somewhere within three months," says Mr. Komer.
"That's kind of silly."
   Since the oil crisis of the early 1970s, the notion of
light forces has gotten little more than lip service. The
problem is buried in the Pentagon's Byzantine arms-buying
bureaucracy.
   Consider the saga of the 20-ton tank. Irving Wolf, a
marketing official at a unit of United Industrial Corp., says
his firm spent more than 10 years trying unsuccessfully to
entice the Army into building this "Rapid Deployment Forces
Tank." Designed so half a dozen could be carried in a C-5
transport, it would be mounted with a high-velocity, 75mm
cannon developed by Pentagon researchers to penetrate Soviet
tank armor -- precisely the kind of weapon now needed against
Iraq's tanks.
   But the Army always remained cool to the idea, Mr. Wolf
says. Its officers were a "little bit concerned about whether
or not a light tank would affect {funding for} the M-1 tank."
   Defending the M-1 is a religion in the Army. Even though
officials admit that they could use a good, light tank for
fast deployment, they cannot abandon their 100% commitment to
the 60-ton M-1, only one of which could be carried by a C-5
to places this far away. The Army has been promoting
development of a much heavier tank -- versions of which are
estimated to weigh a whopping 80 tons. This proposed
behemoth, development of which has been slowed up by budget
pressures, simply couldn't fit into any airplane or travel on
most roads. It would collapse bridges even in developed
countries such as West Germany, let alone ones in the Third
World.
                                                                                                       

   Airlift and sealift capacity must be upgraded.
   Historically, efforts to enhance cargo-carrying capacity
have been relegated to the back burner by gung-ho generals
and admirals, who tend to focus instead on more sexy combat
equipment. Lawrence Korb, who helped oversee President
Reagan's trillion-dollar military buildup, says civilian
officials had to force the Navy to develop the fast roll-on,
roll-off ships now carrying M-1 tanks and Bradley Fighting
Vehicles toward the Persian Gulf. "The Navy didn't want to
spend all the money to fix these ships so that they could be
used to put Army stuff on," he says flatly. The first batch
of the long-awaited heavy armor is expected to reach the
field later this week.
   Spurred by the crisis in the Middle East, the Army's top
brass now appears committed to trying to solve the problem by
advocating creation of a stronger, unified "Transportation
Command." It would have a big budget. It would have a lot of
clout. There's just one problem: It would dilute Air Force's
authority to buy transport planes.
   The outlook for the C-17, the Air Force's next-generation
cargo plane, is also bleak, but for other reasons. Built by a
McDonnell Douglas Corp. unit, the project is beset by delays,
cost overruns and nagging manufacturing problems that
threaten to keep it mired in low-rate production for years.
   Meanwhile, much of the Air Force's present cargo fleet is
almost ready for retirement, because many of the planes have
been flying since the 1960s. The strain of moving immense
quantities of weapons, food, and other supplies to Saudi
Arabia -- equivalent to relocating a U.S. city of about
40,000 -- is beginning to show on pilots. "Many of us are up
to our maximum {monthly} flying hours," says Air Force Lt.
Steve Jank of Lexington, Mass.
   Improving ship transport, while a goal everyone supports
in the abstract, also faces problems. Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney, committed to improving nuclear defenses and
buying new aircraft, opposes such spending. "Everyone gives
the issue pious approval," fumes Rep. Charles Bennett, the
veteran Florida Democrat who has fought for fast sealift as
chairman of an armed services subcommittee. "But nobody wants
to pay for it."
   The Navy, for its part, saves its clout for backing ships
with guns, not cargo ships.
   Summing it up, Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who is in charge of
the unprecedented supply operation for Desert Shield, says
his crews are "doing the job with host-nation support the
best they can." But the acute shortages of cargo ships and
planes, he says flatly, "have both been documented" during
the crisis.
                                                                                                       

   As nuclear needs decrease, the Pentagon must transfer high
technology to conventional weaponry.
   Here, the situation isn't nearly so glum.
   Just look at Star Wars, the high-tech venture conceived as
a shield against annihilation by Soviet missiles. The
Pentagon lately has been researching a proposed anti-missile
system dubbed "brilliant pebbles," a swarm of small rockets
in space that would guard against Soviet or even Third World
missiles.
   As Iraqi troops were rushing into Kuwait, the Senate
reversed years of solid, bipartisan support for Star Wars,
and voted to delay brilliant pebbles for at least a decade.
Little noticed at the time, though, was a move by lawmakers
to beef up funding for a less ambitious anti-missile system,
called the Arrow, which the U.S. and Israel are jointly
developing with Star Wars money. It may be an archetype for
applying outsized technology to a new array of enemies.
   Researchers say the Arrow, with a speed of approximately
17,000 miles an hour, is designed to intercept ballistic
missiles at such a height that their warheads -- carrying
nerve gas, for instance -- would be destroyed in the
explosion or evaporated before inflicting damage on the
ground. It's intended to protect smaller areas than the
original brilliant pebbles concept. As political backing for
other Star Wars projects fades, support for the Arrow, says
an Israeli official, "is as safe as sun coming up tomorrow in
the Middle East."
   Other more down-to-earth weapons could eventually help
U.S. forces surmount Third World conflagrations. One example
is the FOG-M, a fiber-optic guided missile being developed by
Boeing Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft unit.
Classified Army reports brag that it will "dominate"
battlefields when it is introduced, sometime in 1996.
   Army officials describe the missile, light enough to be
launched from a Jeep, as exactly what the troops in Saudi
Arabia need right now. It is guided through a thin
fiber-optic filament that, unlike the weapons they have now,
allows soldiers to shoot at tanks while keeping their cover.
Not everyone in the Army is so enthusiastic, however. Some of
the service's acquisition officials, resentful of anything
that might make tanks look bad, have insisted on deployment
of the FOG-M only as an anti-helicopter weapon.
                                                                                                       

   Weapons must be developed and produced much faster.
   All this technology transfer is meaningless without rapid
development, something the military establishment has been
notoriously bad at. Take, for example, the FOG-M missile. It
was first demonstrated in an Army laboratory in 1984, yet
remains nowhere near production. The French and the Japanese
have meanwhile swiped the idea for the weapon, and are likely
to field it first. Another example is the AAWS-M, a potent
light anti-tank weapon scheduled to replace the LAW, the
bazookalike missile that U.S. soldiers are carrying here.
Since Vietnam, the LAW has been widely regarded as
ineffectual. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has just started to
develop its replacement, which won't be available for at
least a few years.
   From leathernecks in the field to John Betti, the Defense
Department's top acquisition official, everyone agrees that
the current average of eight or nine years to bring a
relatively simple piece of hardware from the drawing board to
the combat zone is simply too long. Some major Army and Navy
programs take twice that long to become reality.
   The military could field many more weapons by also
improving the ones it has now; with up-to-date radar,
computers and missile-guidance systems, for example, current
fighters and warships could be used instead of altogether new
models. The Air Force and Navy have started down that road,
but the lure of new weapons systems continues to distract
them.
   Pentagon planners proudly boast, for instance, that the
Air Force F-15s and F-16s rushed into Saudi Arabia are more
agile, better maintained and more sophisticated than Iraqi
jet fighters, half of which are believed to be aging
Soviet-built MiG-17s, MiG-21s and Su-7s. But at the same
time, senior Air Force generals have been telling Congress
that U.S. air superiority will diminish in the next decade
unless Congress preserves nearly $100 billion in spending on
new fighters and ground-attack planes.
   Maneuvers such as that are used by all sides in the
defense debate -- a game, says Rep. Aspin, in which all seek
to "argue for their past positions." Iraq's military threat,
he says, "won't be decisive" in shaping the Pentagon's plans
for spending next year. "You don't turn around the U.S.
defense establishment overnight."
