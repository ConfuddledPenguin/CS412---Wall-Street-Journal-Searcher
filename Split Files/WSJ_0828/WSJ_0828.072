   EMERYVILLE, Calif. -- Cetus Corp. said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office has reaffirmed the validity of two of its
patents that are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Du Pont
Co.
   Cetus's stock rose 87.5 cents in national over-the-counter
trading yesterday, to close at $7.625.

   Du Pont filed suit in federal court last year, seeking to
strip Cetus of the two patents, which cover a new
biotechnological tool described as extraordinary by some
observers. The tool is polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,
which gives scientists the power to zero in on a single gene
and multiply it.
   The potential market for PCR is huge, and Du Pont's
interest in the field is intense. But Cetus spurned Du Pont's
efforts to obtain a license to the patents, allying instead
with a competitor.
   Cetus said the reaffirmation of its patents, originally
awarded in 1987, should be "especially helpful" in fighting
Du Pont's action. Last month, Du Pont asked the judge
presiding over the case to rule the patents invalid.
   The judge hasn't yet ruled on Du Pont's motion, and
despite the patent office's reaffirmation the court could
still rule Cetus's patents invalid, said a Cetus spokeswoman.
