   DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said the Michigan
Supreme Court has restricted the company from using its debt
securities in the Midland Cogeneration Venture.
   However, the court released CMS from any restrictions on
its equity interest in the venture, including about $87
million of cash. The utility holding company said it used the
cash yesterday to reduce bank debt.

   The court continued to allow CMS to use the current
earnings on the approximately $1.2 billion principal amount
of notes it holds.
