   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Wholesale sales in West Germany
in July jumped 10% from a year earlier in real, or
price-adjusted, terms, as the economic and monetary union
with East Germany got under way, the Federal Statistics
Office said.
   The price-adjusted data are based on 1985 levels. In
nominal, or unadjusted, terms, West German wholesale sales
increased 10% to 74 billion marks ($47.45 billion).

   The statistics agency said sales of finished products, as
well as of raw materials and intermediate goods, rose
strongly in what was a "very clearly marked development" last
month. The July rise was especially strong, compared with the
real 4% annual drop in wholesalers' sales in June, when sales
also were down 5% in nominal terms.
