   MANILA, the Philippines -- Foreign investments in the
Philippines dropped 73% to 269.5 million pesos ($11.4
million) in June from one billion pesos a year earlier, the
Securities and Exchange Commission reported.
   The June figures on paid-up foreign equity investments in
domestic and foreign stock companies showed a 64% drop from
739.1 million pesos in May.

   The commission noted that investor confidence
significantly waned with the discouraging impact of
controversies surrounding the Luzon Petrochemical Corp. and
the pull-out of Marubeni Corp. from a planned industrial
estate southeast of the capital.
   Luzon Petrochemical and its Taiwanese principal, USI Far
East Corp., have been accused of trying to obtain behest
loans from Philippine financial institutions.
