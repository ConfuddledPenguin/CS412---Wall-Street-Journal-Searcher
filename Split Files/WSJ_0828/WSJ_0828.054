   NEW YORK -- W.R. Grace &amp; Co., a diversified chemical
concern, said its Grace Specialty Chemicals Co. unit plans to
reduce pollution emissions 50% over the next five years,
primarily by substituting materials and modifying certain
manufacturing processes to minimize hazardous waste. Grace
Specialty Chemicals had 1989 sales of $3.3 billion.
   Separately, W.R. Grace said its European Darex division
purchased an additional 22.5% of Neue Transvac Maschinen AG,
based in Kriens, Switzerland, raising its stake to 47.5%.
Grace said it also raised to 39.2% its stake in Canonie
Environmental Services Corp., based in Porter, Ind.
