   DALLAS -- Triton Energy Corp. said it will consider the
request of a major shareholder that Triton sell its three
biggest partly owned units.
   The request came from Industrial Equity Ltd., which holds
a 10.4% Triton stake and has said it might seek control. In a
letter filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Industrial Equity said it had encouraged Triton
to dispose of its interests in Triton Europe, Crusader Ltd.
and Triton Canada -- assets that Industrial Equity called
mature and no longer strategic. Industrial Equity is
controlled by New Zealand investor Robert Brierly.

   Michael P. McInerney, Triton vice president, said the
company's first priority was the completion of its previously
announced restructuring program. "But after that, the sale of
those subsidiaries is something we would consider," he said.
   He declined to estimate the value or size of the three
units. But previously the company estimated that its stake in
Triton Europe -- the largest of the three -- was worth $180
million.
   In the SEC letter, Industrial Equity said it generally
approved of Triton's restructuring plan, which calls for the
sale of aviation operations, a securities portfolio and a
seismic-equipment subsidiary. The plan is designed to
redirect the company's focus toward oil and gas exploration.
   Industrial Equity also said in the letter that it had sold
110,000 Triton shares, lowering its stake to 10.4% from
10.9%.
   As previously reported, Triton took a $31.1 million fiscal
fourth-quarter charge for the write-down of certain assets in
connection with the restructuring plan. For the year ended
May 31, the company recorded a net loss of $54.2 million, or
$2.93 a share, on revenue of $260.1 million, after a
$593,000, or three cent a share, extraordinary gain from a
tax-loss carry-forward.
