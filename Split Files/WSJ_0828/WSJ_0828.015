   AUSTIN, Texas -- Tracor Holdings Inc., overwhelmed by
interest expense taken on in its 1987 leveraged buy-out,
proposed a plan to restructure $730 million in debt and said
it may seek Bankruptcy Court protection if the plan isn't
approved by the defense contractor's bondholders.
   Under the complex proposal, Westmark Systems Inc., the
holding company for Tracor, would be separated into three
independent companies, to be divided among shareholders and
creditors. Tracor's operations will be divided up into those
three companies. While calling the plan "unusual" and
"ingenious," an analyst familiar with Tracor's creditors said
their approval was far from guaranteed and that the company
might be forced to carry out a bankruptcy filing.

   The restructuring proposal came only days before Friday's
deadline for a $16 million interest payment on the company's
14% senior subordinated notes -- a payment the company is
certain to miss. Tracor already is in default on its bank
debt, and in late July those lenders issued a blockage notice
preventing the company from making payments to bondholders,
Tracor said.
   The bankruptcy threat illustrates just how far Tracor has
fallen. While selling about $400 million in Tracor junk
bonds, Merrill Lynch praised Tracor as having the brightest
of futures. At its helm was Navy Adm. Bobby R. Inman --
former head of the National Security Agency -- and on its
board sat a host of other luminaries. Under their leadership,
Merrill predicted, Tracor would post steadily higher
earnings, make strategic acquisitions and convert its
contacts at the Pentagon into rich government contracts.
   It didn't happen. Sales, which Merrill predicted would
grow 15% in 1989 and at double-digit rates after that,
started falling as defense contracts dried up, the victim of
friendlier relations between the U.S. and the Soviets. Mr.
Inman, instead of winning big contracts at the Pentagon,
started speaking out publicly on the perils of LBOs, in which
a small group of investors acquires a company largely with
debt that is ultimately paid with funds generated by the
acquired company. Finally, late last year, Mr. Inman
resigned, and to make debt payments the company began selling
off assets.
   The proposal calls for the creation of three companies:
Westmark Systems Inc., a fuse and electrical devices
manufacturer; Tracor Aviation Inc., a commercial aircraft
modification and maintenance services concern; and TDH Inc.,
a defense contractor.
   Under the proposed program, Tracor's public bondholders
would exchange about $458 million of notes and debentures for
all of the common of two of the companies, Westmark and
Tracor Aviation, plus $48 million face amount of zero-coupon
convertible subordinated notes of Westmark due February 1,
1998, and $45.3 million face amount of zero-coupon senior
secured notes of Tracor Aviation, to mature either in five
years or upon the sale or disposition of Tracor Aviation's
operations, whichever came first.
   Lenders would exchange about $272 million in debt for $125
million in senior secured debt of Westmark, $32 million face
amount of the zero-coupon convertible subordinated debt of
Westmark, $75 million of a senior secured revolving credit
facility of TDH and $22.7 million face amount of the
zero-coupon senior secured notes of Tracor Aviation.
   Existing holders of Westmark common, THI warrants, Tracor
warrants and Tracor common would receive all the common of
TDH, the defense contractor.
   The proposal requires the approval of the company's banks
as well as of bondholders representing 95% of each of two
Tracor issues. Tracor Chairman James B. Skaggs said that if
"less than 95% but more than two-thirds in principal amount
and a majority in number" of the Tracor bondholders approve
the recapitalization plan, the company will file a
"pre-packaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law petition and
reorganization plan.
   By entering Chapter 11, which provides protection from
creditor lawsuits, with its reorganization plan pre-approved
by creditors representing two-thirds or more of its debt, the
company would solve the problem of holdouts, Mr. Skaggs said.
"In that event, 100% of bondholders would be bound by the
recapitalization plan," he said.
