   DALLAS -- When credit was easy and corporate managements
were eager, Thomas Hicks and Robert Haas racked up impressive
returns for their leveraged buy-out partnership. By
negotiating a dozen deals in three years and selling off most
of the assets before prices began plummeting, Hicks, Haas &amp;
Co. turned $90 million into a pile of cash and equity stakes
valued at $1.3 billion.
   Last year, though, the two Dallas investors, best known
for merging Dr Pepper Co. with Seven-Up Co., split up and
headed in different directions.

   Mr. Hicks is trying to raise a $300 million buy-out fund
that he hopes to invest, among other things, in
financial-services firms and companies struggling with too
much debt. And he wants to strike quickly, aiming to buy $3
billion of companies over the next two to three years.
   Mr. Haas, however, wants to stick with small industrial
companies and doesn't believe in "blind pools," which are
funds raised without a specific deal in mind. Nor is Mr. Haas
in any hurry to make new investments, believing that business
owners and managers haven't yet lowered their expectations
from the high prices paid a year or two ago.
   "Some people forget there are two parts to `buy low, sell
high,'" says Mr. Haas. "We knew when to sell."
   Now, Hicks, Muse &amp; Co. and the unrelated Haas &amp; Partners
want to prove that they also know when to buy. While other
buy-out firms, notably Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., have
been selling some businesses while trying to patch up
troublesome deals, the Hicks and Haas firms are hovering like
buzzards, waiting to pounce on the overly indebted companies
emerging from the buy-out binge.
   Mr. Haas says he's interested in picking over the remains
of "deals that were done at the extreme end of the leverage
spectrum, where the capital structure doesn't fit, like a
suit that's two sizes too big." Says Mr. Hicks: "A lot of
companies bought at 10 to 11 times cash flow will hit the
wall. They'll have to be restructured. They'll need new
money."
   There's a lot of competition to provide that money,
however. Well over $3 billion has been raised in various
funds dedicated to turnaround and bankruptcy investing
strategies, including one $1.8 billion pool raised by E.M.
Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. Deals today require more equity than
before because lenders are leery of piling on the debt, says
Max Derden, principal at William M. Mercer Inc., a Dallas
pension-fund investment consultant. The staggering returns of
the junk-bond era now will subside to more "realistic"
levels, he says.
   During the two men's six-year partnership, Mr. Hicks, an
outgoing, native Texan and former oilman, specialized in
bringing in the deals and sweet-talking the target company's
management. Mr. Haas, a lawyer from Ohio, is a cautious
numbers-cruncher; he focused on the detailed work of closing
deals and monitoring company performance. Working together,
they amassed what was one of the largest soft-drink empires
in the country. Hicks &amp; Haas reaped a 10-fold return when Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up Cos. was recapitalized, although the
soft-drink company is currently struggling under heavy debts.
   The only disagreement the two men will discuss publicly
concerned financing. Mr. Hicks wanted to raise a fund in
advance that would take 10% equity stakes in buy-outs itself
while also seeking other equity partners for specific deals.
But Mr. Haas preferred raising money solely on a deal-by-deal
basis, as the two men had done in the past. As a result, Mr.
Hicks formed a new partnership with John Muse and Jack Furst,
who had worked with Hicks &amp; Haas in earlier deals. Mr. Hicks
says he has raised about $170 million so far from
institutions, Dallas companies and wealthy individuals.
   The fund takes an annual management fee of 1.5% on all
commitments and will get an additional fee of 1.5% of each
buy-out's total cost for arranging the deals. Fund investors
will receive the first 20% return on each buy-out; further
profits will be split 50-50 by the investors and Hicks Muse.
Scott Ozanus, a mergers and acquisitions specialist at Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co. in Dallas, which does some work with Mr.
Hicks, says, "there's no doubt" that having a prearranged
fund will benefit a firm pursuing deals in the next few
years.
   But Mr. Haas wonders why anyone would argue with success.
Raising capital from scratch for each buy-out gives investors
a chance to question terms and contribute advice, he says.
"It's a healthy exercise to have to convince your sources of
capital" that a deal is a good one, he says, adding that it
was blind capital pools that led to some of the "excessive"
buy-outs of the 1980s.
   "We didn't have blind capital and we did not have a single
blowout," Mr. Haas says. Rather than raise a fund, he and his
partner Thomas Harrison, who also worked with Hicks &amp; Haas,
are building informal alliances with institutions and other
investors who can be called upon to back their deals.
   Mr. Haas says he expects he and his sometime partners will
have to put up between 20% and 30% equity into deals, much
more than in the past. But he is confident that the investors
who did so well with Hicks &amp; Haas will continue to back him.
"When you go back to these institutions with a third deal,
it's easier than it was the first time," he says. Says Mr.
Derden of William M. Mercer: Mr. Haas "knows where the funds
are, so I don't think {the lack of an equity fund} will make
much difference."
   The former partners also are aiming at some different
targets these days. While Mr. Hicks wants to continue
pursuing the same kinds of industrial companies the pair once
pursued, he is also going after life insurance companies, a
business Hicks &amp; Haas avoided. "We think it's a large,
fragmented industry that is consolidating," he says.
   Mr. Hicks says many small, old-line life insurers have
stumbled of late, mainly those whose managers were too
conservative in investment strategies. He plans to
concentrate on small, inefficient operations that can't
survive on their own. He has a cadre of managers in place
from the management buy-out he led of seven operating units
of troubled I.C.H. Corp.
   Mr. Haas doesn't like financial companies' sensitivity to
interest rates and economic cycles, and he doesn't like the
uncertainties of regulation. He says he'll stick with
industrial companies, such as the $70 million buy-out his
partnership led last fall of Jackson Products Inc., a
safety-equipment manufacturer, from Airgas Inc. He's looking
for more safety-equipment makers to combine with Jackson
Products and for other companies that are leaders in
industrial niche businesses.
   Although Hicks Muse has negotiated two buy-outs so far
this year -- the latest is a $100 million purchase of two
media-services companies -- Mr. Haas isn't in any hurry.
   "The quality of deals for sale is inferior today to what
was for sale several years ago," Mr. Haas says. He also
declines to set a total dollar-amount goal for his
acquisitions because, he says, such goals can encourage bad
investments: "If the good deals aren't there, you'll
overpay."
