   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rallied in their
biggest one-day gain since shortly after the October 1987
market crash, but traders remained wary of the recovery.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 13.94 to 381.27, a 3.79%
gain. That's the largest one-day percentage gain for smaller
stocks since Oct. 30, 1987, and the fifth largest in history.

   However, volume fell to 129.4 million shares from 161.1
million Friday. Advancing stocks swamped decliners, 1,560 to
543, but only 19 stocks hit new highs while 107 fell to new
lows.
   Encouraged by falling oil prices and hopes for a
negotiated settlement in the Middle East, small investors
joined institutions in snapping up shares battered by last
week's market plunge, traders said. The day's relatively
light trading made many traders nervous about the strength of
the revival.
   "I think it will be like a rally in a bear market --
sudden, sharp and short," said Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of
world-wide equities for Shearson Lehman Brothers. Without
further bad news from the Middle East or on the economic
front, he suggested OTC stocks could extend their gains the
next few days, but would succumb to profit-taking late in the
week.
   "There's a lot of uncertainty out there," agreed E.E.
"Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., New
York. "I think it's all still up in the air until we get
something definitive out of the Middle East."
   Emboldened by buoyant markets overseas, investors rushed
to buy shares on the opening. The recovery in foreign
financial markets "set the stage" yesterday morning, said
William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons,
St. Louis. However, Mr. Sulya said that as the day closed he
saw investors taking some profits. "I wouldn't be surprised
if they take the market down tomorrow," he added.
   The day's largest gainers included some of the OTC's
biggest stocks or, as Mr. Da Puzzo described them, "our Nifty
50." Among the day's leaders, Nike sprinted 6 1/2 to 68,
Microsoft jumped 4 3/4 to 60 3/4, Apple Computer added 2 to
37 3/4, MCI Communications advanced 1 to 33 7/8 and the
American depositary receipts of Reuters Holdings PLC leaped 3
to 51 3/4.
   Corporate plans to buy back stock continued to boost
shares. Liz Claiborne rose 1 3/4 to 27 1/2 after the clothing
retailer said it would buy back an additional $50 million of
its stock -- about 1.9 million shares at Friday's price.
   Intel, the day's most active stock, added 1/4 to 36 1/4,
extending Friday's gains. Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif.,
semiconductor maker said it will buy back as many as 20
million of its 195.6 million shares outstanding.
   Sun Microsystems surged 1 1/4 to 28 7/8. Friday, the
Mountain View, Calif., computer workstation maker confirmed
it dropped a planned public offering of 5.9 million shares of
common.
   Among other technology shares, 3Com Corp. jumped 1 to 12
7/8 and SynOptics Communications added 1 to 26 1/4. The two
California makers of computer networking systems announced a
strategic alliance designed to integrate the management of
certain products.
   Novell eased 1/4 to 24 after trading as high as 25 1/2.
After the market closed, the Provo, Utah, maker of personal
computer network systems reported net income for its third
quarter rose to 38 cents a share from 18 cents a year
earlier.
   Trans World Music leaped 3 1/2 to 23 after the Albany,
N.Y., retailer of records, tapes and videos reported net
income for the second quarter, ended Aug. 4, rose to 18 cents
a share from 11 cents a year ago.
   Scitex jumped 3 to 32 1/2 after the Israeli maker of
computer imaging products declared a 2-for-1 stock split.
Ordinary shares of another Israeli computer concern,
Optrotech, added 1 to 5 1/2.
   Medical-related issues also rebounded. Summit Technology
gained 1/4 to 11 3/4 on nearly 1.6 million shares, more than
six times average volume. The Food and Drug Administration
told the Watertown, Mass., developer of laser surgery
products it can proceed with the second phase of tests of a
Summit laser for the treatment of nearsightedness. Among
other medical products issues, Marquest Medical Products
gained 1 1/8 to 8 1/4.
   Chiron surged 3 1/2 to 35 1/4 after Ciba-Geigy AG, the
Swiss pharmaceutical company, said that a two-year human
trial of an experimental AIDS vaccine produced encouraging
results, but was only a limited success. The experimental
vaccine is being developed by Biocine Co., a joint venture of
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy's U.S. subsidiary. Human trials of a
new experimental vaccine, using knowledge gained in the
Geneva study, will start in the U.S. before the end of the
year, Ciba-Geigy said.
   Among biotechnology issues, Cetus rose 7/8 to 7 5/8. The
Emeryville, Calif., company said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office will issue certificates reaffirming the
validity of all claims of two Cetus patents. Cetus said the
move supports its position in a lawsuit with Du Pont Co.
involving the patents.
   Bullish comment by analysts boosted other issues. Centocor
catapulted 6 3/4 to 37 after Labe Simpson &amp; Co. analyst
Joseph Edelman repeated a "buy" opinion on the Malvern, Pa.,
biotechnology concern, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report. Mr. Edelman also repeated a "buy" rating on
Chiron.
   Ryan's Family Steak Houses added 7/8 to 6 1/8 after
Prudential-Bache analyst Leslie Steppel upgraded her
investment opinion on the Greer, S.C., restaurant operator to
"buy" from "hold," PIR said. Ms. Steppel estimates Ryan's
will earn 47 cents a share in 1990 and 55 cents in 1991,
compared with 41 cents in 1989.
   Maynard Oil rose 7/8 to 7 5/8 after Barron's magazine gave
the Dallas oil company a favorable review. Maynard, which has
a book value of $6 a share, is expected to earn 65 cents a
share this year, up from 44 cents in 1989; 1990 cash flow is
estimated at $1.40 a share.
