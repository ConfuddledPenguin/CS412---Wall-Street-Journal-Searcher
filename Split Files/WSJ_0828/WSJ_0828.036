   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Amwest Insurance Group Inc. said
it will post a fiscal third-quarter gain of $797,000, or 34
cents a share, in the wake of a state measure signed into law
Sunday.
   The law exempts certain types of insurance, including
surety bonds, from rate rollbacks and other major provisions
of Proposition 103, a controversial initiative that passed in
1988. Amwest is an insurance holding company that specializes
in surety bonds.

   Amwest had established a $1.4 million pretax reserve for
potential premium rebates in its second quarter, ended June
30. The $797,000 gain reflects a reversal of the reserve in
the current quarter, ending Sept. 30.
