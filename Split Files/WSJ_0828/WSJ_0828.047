   It's scary enough to open a new restaurant anywhere. But
one of the toughest acts of all is starting a restaurant
aimed at New York's hip young trend-setters.
   If you're not chic there on day one, you're deserted on
day two.

   Every year, though, a few places make it big. Three months
ago, Coffee Shop on Union Square didn't exist. Today, police
barricades control the lines of young hopefuls waiting
outside for a chance to be in the right place. Actor Matt
Dillon has eaten there. So has television personality Julie
Brown. New York magazine calls it "this summer's place to
be."
   Unfortunately, there's no simple formula to create this
sort of success. "You just know it when you see it," says
Frank Zagat, editor of Zagat's Restaurant Survey.
   But experts on New York hipness have developed a few rules
of the trade. First is: Don't worry about the food. "Terrible
food is almost a prerequisite," says Mimi Sheraton,
restaurant critic for Time Magazine, although she cites the
currently fashionable TriBeCa Grill, whose partners include
Robert De Niro, as an exception.
   Hip restaurateurs agree that ambiance counts for more than
cooking. "We see ourselves as designers as much as
restaurateurs," says one owner of Coffee Shop, "because the
restaurant business today is a total entertainment package."
Though Coffee Shop has a stylish, informal modern interior,
its nondescript exterior has a touch of down-market chic: a
neon sign saying "Coffee Shop."
   In other respects as well, the more novelty the better,
owners say. For instance, Coffee Shop employs models to work
as waiters and waitresses. Even the bouncer at the door is a
model. Owners Eric Petterson, Carolyn Effer and Charles
Milite have made this gimmick a trademark; they also used it
successfully at their first restaurant, Live Bait.
   Bernard's Cafe, on the other hand, benefits from the
novelty of an incongruous setting. On Avenue A, the French
brasserie brings to Manhattan's Lower East Side a very
different crowd from the poor artists and the just plain poor
who live nearby.
   Another rule, experts say, is that advertising doesn't
really work. "If you start to advertise, people assume you
must be herding," says Coffee Shop's Mr. Petterson.
   Instead, much depends on word of mouth -- and on the
connections and associations of the restaurant's owner. Thus
the owners of Coffee Shop, all with backgrounds in the
modeling business, attracted a professionally good-looking
crowd they already knew.
   And Rick Wahlstedt, co-owner with Ulrich Troejerborg of
the equally trendy Punsch restaurant, brought with him the
fashionable crowd that used to frequent Indochine, the
restaurant where he worked as manager until last year.
   Owners go to many lengths to attract the "right" crowd.
Before it even opened, Punsch hosted four private parties,
including fashion designer Thierry Mugler's birthday
celebration. The parties brought in celebrities and society
writers, says Mr. Wahlstedt.
   In some cases, newly opened restaurants can't keep up with
their own success.
   By the time La Coupole opened in January 1982, it couldn't
have generated more excitement with the fashionable set.
Following a two-page spread in New York Magazine, the
240-seat restaurant was packed. Says James Devine, who left
River Cafe to work there, "We couldn't bang the food out fast
enough."
   But that was just the problem. The restaurant just
couldn't handle "240 people sitting down at the same time"
and the food wasn't good enough to make people want to come
back again, he says. Slammed by the same critics who had
hyped it only 14 months earlier, La Coupole closed in March
1983. Says Mr. Devine, "It would still be alive today if
everyone had been prepared for the onslaught of people."
   But even if restaurants survive the onslaught, they can't
expect to keep the "in" crowd forever. Says Brian McNally,
whose creations include Indochine, Canal Bar and 150 Wooster:
"That's inevitable. It's in the nature of trendiness."
   Mr. Petterson of Coffee Shop remembers a friend's warning
at the opening night of Live Bait in September 1987: "It's
like modeling. . . . You start at the top and then it's all
downhill."
   Some restaurateurs seem to thrive on shooting-star
businesses. Mr. McNally's formula has been to take places
that are already restaurants and to spend comparatively
little on them. Of Canal Bar, in which he invested less than
$100,000, he says, "We made a lot of money and then we got
out."
   But for most restaurants-of-the-moment, the safest bet is
to become the kind of restaurant where people actually go to
eat -- where quality of service and food count.
   It also helps to attract a neighborhood crowd. Says Gael
Greene, restaurant critic for New York Magazine, "If you
don't have something to give the neighborhood when the heat
cools, you've had it." Coffee Shop may also thrive as a
neighborhood restaurant, says Chip Fisher, a corporate
catering executive and an authority on the restaurant
business. He believes the place will benefit from catering to
a specific group -- models and photographers who work around
Union Square.
   Drew Nieporent, managing partner of the chic TriBeCa
Grill, hopes his restaurant will develop into a family
restaurant. If so, it may be part of yet another restaurant
trend -- toward more moderate, family-oriented places.
   Says Michael Musto, columnist at the Village Voice,
"People are just getting bored of spending a lot of money on
something which isn't really satisfying."
   Even Brian McNally seems to be abandoning the spirit of
the '80s. He says he wants to be "almost obsessively
egalitarian" about letting people into his next creation, a
brasserie in the recently opened Paramount Hotel.
   But he still may get a hip crowd. Judging by all the
publicity, the Paramount Hotel itself has just become chic.
