   Phone, Phone on the Range: Now,
   It's Simpler to Call on the Hoof

   Cowpokes who ride tall in the saddle can now phone home
without having to dismount.
   Three new pay phones, 80 inches from hoof to coin slot,
were installed recently at the Lazy E Ranch just north of
Oklahoma City, which plays host to the World Championship
Quarter Horse Show each November. Spending 25 cents while
astride a favorite steed should give new meaning to the term
quarter horse, suggests St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co., a unit of Southwestern Bell Corp.

   Convenience for cowhands is just part of Southwestern
Bell's plan to go beyond its 187,000 traditional,
54-inch-high public phones.
   This is the target market: active Americans who can't be
bothered to move too many muscles to make a call.
   Near the 15th tee at the Westwood Park Golf Course in
Norman, Okla., is Southwestern Bell's first 50-inch-high
Phone From Golf Cart, a boon for beeper-carrying doctors and
executives whose athletic skills don't include the sprint, or
bailing out of a golf cart for that matter.
   "Golfers would have a heart attack if they had an
emergency and had to run all the way back to our clubhouse,"
says Westwood golf pro David Lisle.
   Along the Arkansas River is the Sooner State's only Phone
From Bike. Without resort to a kickstand, bikers can dial up
on a phone perched 50 inches above the bike path. And soon to
be shipped are 36-inch-high phones for lakes and reservoirs
in Southwestern Bell's five-state region, where boaters will
be able to make calls without disembarking.
   Ergonomical public phones have already gotten good
reception. Southwestern Bell and other Baby Bells have been
putting in pay phones with extra-long cords for drivers in
cars and trucks for years.
   But the trend's latest extension doesn't ring true for
some beneficiaries.
   "That's a curious adaptation of America's drive-through"
tradition, says a spokesman for the Bicycle Federation, a
Washington group promoting "a bicycle-friendly society." He
isn't impressed: "People don't usually lose their balance and
fall off the trail when they make phone calls astride their
bikes."
   Other telephone companies, too, are skeptical. "We just
don't have enough horses," says an Ameritech spokesman in
Chicago, who adds it isn't customizing phone booths "for the
Guinness Book of World Records."
