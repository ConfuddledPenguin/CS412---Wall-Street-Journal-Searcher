   DALLAS -- E-Systems Inc. pleaded guilty to charges that it
falsified test results and defrauded the U.S. government on
contracts for Army field radios. It agreed to pay $4.6
million to settle civil and criminal charges.
   An E-Systems spokesman said the settlement will allow the
electronic systems and products company to continue doing
business with the U.S. government. "All of our problems have
been cleared up," he said.

   E-Systems said it will pay a $2 million fine and $1.8
million in restitution to settle criminal charges filed in a
Tampa, Fla., federal court as well as $850,000 to settle
civil charges brought by the Department of Justice. As part
of the plea agreement, E-Systems said it will drop its
pending $38 million lawsuit against the federal government.
   E-Systems took an $8.6 million write-off against its
second-quarter earnings in anticipation of the guilty plea,
the spokesman said.
   The tactical field radios were supplied to the Army by
E-Systems through its Memcor division, which has since been
discontinued. The indictment charged that E-Systems and
others falsified performance records of the radios and
concealed repairs and defects.
   This month, three former Memcor managers and a former
supervisor were charged by a federal grand jury with
falsifying records and test results to conceal failures and
defects in radios supplied to the U.S. Army.
   A production supervisor, Sadonna S. Hobbs, was convicted
Jan. 31 of perjury relating to denials of her activity in
connection with suits filed by E-Systems before the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals. She is serving a 16-month
federal prison term.
