   NEW YORK -- Responding to law-enforcement officials'
claims that future insider-trading prosecutions were at risk,
the federal appeals court in Manhattan agreed to a rare,
full-court review of the reversal of former stockbroker
Robert Chestman's conviction.
   The reversal decision, issued May 2 by three members of
the appeals court, essentially gutted two major laws used by
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department in fighting insider trading. The U.S. Second
Circuit Court of Appeals typically doesn't grant a full
review of decisions by its three-judge panels.

   In asking the court to rehear the appeal, the SEC said,
"The panel decision, unless set aside, could undermine the
ability of {authorities} . . . to police insider trading,
which has been one of the most important areas of
securities-law enforcement in recent years."
   The U.S. attorney's office, which made the formal request
for a rehearing, said in its brief that the panel's "decision
may well be viewed by the securities industry as providing a
safe harbor within which to trade on inside information."
   Richard A. Kirby, the SEC's senior litigation counsel,
called the decision to rehear the case "a positive step for
the SEC."
   The decision reversing Mr. Chestman's conviction focused
on two areas: whether a fiduciary duty has to be violated for
an insider-trading law to apply, and whether someone who
trades on a stock tip violates the law if the tipper didn't
specifically say that the information was confidential.
   The appeals court announced that a majority of its judges
had voted to reconsider the decision. Oral arguments on the
appeal will be heard by the court at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9. The
court could decide to uphold the panel's decision, which
resulted in Mr. Chestman's release from prison, or it could
rule that the conviction before the trial judge was proper.
   The court said it will address issues raised regarding a
securities regulation called Rule 14e-3, which makes it a
crime to trade on misappropriated information involving a
tender offer. The SEC commonly relies on Rule 14e-3 in
pursuing insider-trading cases against defendants who aren't
company insiders.
   The court also will look at Rule 10b-5, which makes it a
crime to trade on a stock tip that is nonpublic information.
Law-enforcement officials said the earlier decision would
prohibit the use of circumstantial evidence in showing that
someone who received a tip knew or should have known that the
stock information was confidential.
   Already the appeals-court panel's reversal of the Chestman
conviction has been cited in at least one lower-court
decision in a federal insider-trading case. And Thomas
Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel, said the panel's
decision is being cited by defense attorneys in cases across
the U.S. In its brief, the SEC said, "The impact of the panel
decision is enhanced by the pre-eminent role of this circuit
in the development of the law of insider trading."
   "The original decision was potentially very damaging for"
the SEC's law-enforcement division, Mr. Newkirk said. "The
fact that this circuit is where all our good cases have
historically originated makes it even more important."
   The court's agreement to review the reversal means the
decision now is not binding on federal district judges in the
circuit.
   Mr. Chestman's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Chestman, formerly a broker with Gruntal &amp; Co., was
found guilty in March 1989 of 31 counts related to alleged
insider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock just before the
company's takeover in 1986 by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea
Co.
   The trading was based on information that Mr. Chestman
received fourth-hand, from an in-law of Waldbaum's
then-president. The court reversed the conviction on the
ground that Mr. Chestman hadn't been told that the
information was confidential.
