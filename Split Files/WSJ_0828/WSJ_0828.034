   HEWLETT, N.Y. -- Anchor Savings Bank named 47-year-old
Richard W. Dalrymple, formerly Bank of Boston Corp.'s head of
world-wide banking services, as president, chief operating
officer and a director.
   The executive succeeds William G. Schneider Jr., who
resigned last September. Mr. Schneider had claimed his duties
had been reduced by a reorganization initiated by James M.
Large Jr., Anchor's chairman and chief executive officer.

   In July, the savings bank, which has 13 directors,
reported net income for the fourth quarter ended June 30 of
$40.9 million, or $2.15 a share, versus a net loss of $26.9
million, or $1.75 a share, in the year-earlier period.
   The earnings reflect gains from asset sales that are part
of Anchor's effort to fully meet federal capital standards.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Anchor
shares gained 12.5 cents to close at $1.75.
