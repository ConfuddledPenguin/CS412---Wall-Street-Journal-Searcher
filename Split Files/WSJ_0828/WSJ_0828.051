   It looks as if Irish rock singer Sinead O'Connor won't be
playing New Jersey's Garden State Arts Center again. She
announced backstage Friday that she wouldn't perform if the
U.S. national anthem were played first, as is policy at the
state-run center. Officials felt it was too late to cancel
her performance. She wasn't acting out of solidarity with
Roseanne Barr, last seen spewing spit onto the turf after
singing "The Star Spangled Banner." No, Sinead O'Connor
objects to how the U.S. government grants arts subsidies. "I
feel very strongly about censorship," she said, "and I don't
want to go onstage after the anthem of a country that's
arresting people and harassing people for expressing
themselves onstage." We haven't heard about any arrests in
the United States yet of chocolate-covered women, but
censoring the national anthem does give new meaning to Ms.
O'Connor's hit, "Nothing Compares 2 U."
