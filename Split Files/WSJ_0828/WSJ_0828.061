   Some Hispanic media executives fear that proposed
restrictions on alcohol and tobacco advertising would
threaten the existence of many minority newspapers and
magazines.
   "It would be devastating" for Hispanic magazines and
newspapers if Congress banned such advertising, said Tino
Duran, president of the National Association of Hispanic
Publications and the owner of two small newspapers in Texas.
Mr. Duran, who attended a recent forum on the subject,
estimated that the 350 Hispanic newspapers that belong to his
association receive about 20% of their ad revenue from
alcohol and tobacco companies. Without it, Mr. Duran said,
many would fold.

   Latino publications depend on tobacco, alcohol and
fast-food advertising because many other companies don't see
Hispanics as important consumers, said Alfredo J. Estrada,
editor and publisher of Hispanic magazine. "Many companies
view them as being poor," said Mr. Estrada. "It's hard for
them to realize there are Hispanic professionals."
   Community activists and lawmakers, citing higher levels of
diseases associated with smoking and drinking among blacks
and Latinos, are pushing to rein in companies that
aggressively pitch tobacco and alcohol to those groups.
   A report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
a nonprofit advocacy group for public-health policies, titled
"Marketing Disease to Hispanics" criticized Hispanic groups
for taking advertising revenue and charitable donations from
the tobacco, alcohol and junk-food industries in the face of
rising health problems among Hispanics.
   The center's report said Mexican-American men are 40% more
likely to die from cirrhosis of the liver than white men. The
death rate from adult diabetes for Mexican-Americans in the
Southwest is double that of whites, the center said. And the
incidence of cancer among Hispanics is also on the rise.
Meanwhile, the study notes, tobacco, alcohol and junk-food
advertising to Hispanic communities is increasing. The report
parallels earlier findings on blacks.
   At the forum earlier this month, Hispanic media
professionals gave a collective thumbs-down to congressional
efforts to restrain alcohol and tobacco advertising in U.S.
publications. The Hispanics also lambasted the report from
the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Mr. Duran
called the study racially paternalistic, saying it implies
that Hispanic consumers must be protected because they aren't
smart enough to know better.
   Ernest Bromley, president of Sosa &amp; Associates, San
Antonio, Texas, one of the largest Hispanic advertising
agencies in the country, called the 100-page report "yellow
journalism" for implying that Hispanic organizations have
"sold out" to the corporate dollar.
   The media representatives argued that attempts to restrict
advertising infringe on freedom of speech, the position taken
by tobacco, alcohol and fast-food companies. "I don't want
the great white father leading the Hispanic to the proper
course," said Mr. Duran. He scoffs at the report's suggestion
that ads from such ubiquitous marketers as Coca-Cola and
McDonald's be banned, asking, "Why don't they censor Jello?"
   The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce also opposes the
advertising restrictions. That group is lobbying to defeat a
bill that would allow each state to regulate tobacco ads.
Jose Nino, president of the Hispanic chamber, said such a
bill, if passed, would have an "extremely severe" impact on
the Hispanic population by depriving Hispanics of "thousands"
of jobs in the advertising and publications field.
   Some Hispanic groups, most notably the National Coalition
of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations, support
the idea of restricted advertising and a ban on donations.
"If they are marketing a product that kills our youths, we
should look elsewhere {for money}," said Dr. Jane Delgado,
president of the nonprofit Hispanic health coalition. The
coalition never has taken money from tobacco companies, and
three years ago it stopped accepting donations from the
alcohol industry.
   Debate at the forum, called specifically to address the
advertising issue, spilled over into talk about donations
made by alcohol, tobacco and fast-food companies to nonprofit
Hispanic organizations. Mr. Estrada of Hispanic magazine said
the study's recommendations would have a "chilling effect" on
corporations that have provided scholarships and educational
programs to the Hispanic community.
   Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest and co-author of the report,
said many Hispanic groups have had to rely more and more on
donations from corporations since federal funds for social
programs were slashed during the Reagan administration. But
such gifts have strings attached, Mr. Jacobson charges. "They
want something in return," he said. "They want silence, if
not advocates."
   The National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest
Latino advocacy organization, accepts donations from tobacco,
alcohol and food companies, but maintains there's no problem
with doing so.
   "The total amount of money we get from alcohol and tobacco
companies amounts to 1% or 2%" of the organization's total
annual budget, says Raul Yzaguirre, president of the council,
"so they are hardly in a position to influence us."
