   Cyprus Minerals Co. said it will spend $92.5 million to
modernize and expand its Miami, Ariz., copper smelter.
   Cyprus said the expansion would command a sizable portion
of the Denver mining company's 1991 capital expenditure
budget, which has been about $200 million a year for the past
couple of years. The expansion, which is designed to make
Cyprus self-sufficient in copper smelting capacity, will be
completed in mid-1992, the company estimated. The move will
increase Cyprus's concentrate smelting capacity to 650,000
tons from 450,000 tons annually.

   The completed facility will reduce the consumption of
electric power, the biggest cost in producing copper, a
spokesman said. The upgrading of the facility has been part
of the company's long-term plans since it bought the smelter
from Inspiration Resources Corp. in 1988.
   Cyprus said that regardless of the plans for the expanded
smelter, the company will "meet its obligations" in a
copper-concentrate smelting contract it has with Magma Copper
Co., which runs through mid-1996. Magma processes about
150,000 tons of copper concentrates annually for Cyprus at a
San Manuel, Ariz., smelter.
