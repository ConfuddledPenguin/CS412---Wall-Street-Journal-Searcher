   NEW YORK -- A slight relaxation of Mideast tensions and a
sharp decline in oil prices caused precious metals prices to
plunge. Gold sustained its biggest one-day loss in more than
seven years.
   There had been widespread fear that war might break out in
the Middle East over the weekend, analysts said. When it
didn't materialize, and then Iraq was reported to be willing
to talk with United Nations officials, heavy selling
developed, they said.

   Gold gave up most of the gains it had run up since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. Silver and platinum, which had
reluctantly followed the gold advance, fell to levels below
those prevailing before the invasion.
   December delivery gold fell $27 an ounce to $396.20, the
biggest one-day drop since the price plunged $42.50 on Feb.
28, 1983, according to the Commodity Exchange. The decline
wiped out 73% of the December contract's gains from its high
of $425 reached twice this month. The day before the invasion
of Kuwait, the December contract settled at $382.40.
   December silver fell 35 cents an ounce to $4.9650, the
biggest one-day decline since July 25, 1988, when the price
fell 57 cents to $7.036, the exchange said. On Aug. 1, the
December contract settled at $4.96.
   October platinum dropped $21.30 an ounce to $486.00, the
largest one-day decline since Dec. 19, 1988, when the price
fell $29.20 to $525.30. On Aug. 1, the October contract
settled at $492.20.
   "It goes to show how fundamentally weak this market really
is," said Peter Cardillo, director of commodity research for
Jesup Josephthal &amp; Co., New York. "It took only one day to
wipe out most of the gains that it took gold three weeks to
accumulate. It shows that the main force behind this market
is Iraq and that country's effect on the oil price and its
inflationary potential. Whichever way oil moves, gold will
move with it."
   Another analyst said, "this is what happens when you have
a one-issue scenario." He also said the London market's
closing for a holiday may have contributed to the heavy
trading and the price declines.
   Analysts, however, warned that yesterday's reaction to the
Mideast situation didn't accurately reflect existing
conditions.
   "You can't tell me that conditions have changed to the
extent that they warrant a $27 change in one day," one
analyst said.
   Another analyst, Douglas Newby, of S.G. Warburg, &amp; Co.,
said: "I don't see anything that suggests a peaceful
settlement is going to take place. War could still break out
this week, next week or at any time."
   Anthony Rizzuto Jr., analyst for Nomura Research
Institute, said: "If a diplomatic solution takes place, the
gold price will fall another $30. But will the situation be
resolved that easily?"
   On the other hand, Jeffrey Nichols, president of American
Precious Metals Advisors in Toronto, said that even when gold
was rising, it didn't have a particularly strong
underpinning.
   "There has been little evidence of any widespread or
meaningful rise in physical investment demand for gold in
either North America or Europe," he said. "Sales of bullion
coins or small bars are up on both continents but not enough
to matter much to the overall world market."
   Caution is advised, Mr. Nichols said, because the market
has moved higher on the basis of "short-term views and hot
money," both of which have been reflecting the volatile
Mideast crisis.
   Mr. Nichols said that before yesterday's setback, market
professionals had expressed disappointment that the price of
gold was up only to $405 or $415. Their argument, Mr. Nichols
said, was that gold should have risen considerably higher in
view of the Mideast situation, oil at $30 a barrel, plunging
stock markets world-wide and a weaker U.S. dollar.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND LIVESTOCK: Speculation that the chances of war
in the Middle East are easing had opposite effects on the
agricultural markets. Prices of futures contracts for cattle
and hogs jumped yesterday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, however, contracts for corn,
wheat and soybeans slipped. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, some
economists predicted that the burden of rising oil costs
would help push the U.S. economy into a recession. Livestock
traders pushed down hog and cattle prices on the assumption
that consumers would respond to any recession by buying less
beef and pork. With the Middle East crisis seeming to slip
into a stalemate, livestock analysts are downgrading the
chances of a full-blown recession, so livestock prices are
rebounding. In the grain pits, however, the apparent easing
of tensions helped to depress prices. For several weeks,
traders had been speculating that higher oil prices would
help some oil-producing countries, such as the Soviet Union,
generate more currency to finance grain purchases from the
U.S. That speculation is being deflated at least temporarily.
Corn prices also are being depressed by forecasts for a
relatively large harvest this fall. In the wake of heavy
summer rains, much of the Midwest crop is well suited to
withstand a recent spate of high temperatures, analysts said.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose. The December contract ended
with a gain of 1.30 cents a pound at $1.2485. With most of
the interest focused on the Mideast and on oil, copper was
little noticed, an analyst said. The market opened higher and
held there most of the day. Another analyst said that, while
the 11-day-old miners' strike in Peru was causing some
concern over supplies, a union spokesman reportedly expressed
confidence that the walkout would end this week. Demand for
physical copper remained quiet, a dealer said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices rose. The December contract gained
0.64 cent a pound to 72.99 cents. Demand was stimulated by
concern that the quality of cotton in the Mississippi Delta
and Southeastern states might have been affected by the
recent heat and drought, an analyst said. Also, he noted,
after the close of trading Friday the government raised its
estimate of mill consumption during the first 10 months of
the 1989-90 season, which ended July 31, to 8,725,000 bales
from 8.6 million. The rally in futures encountered aggressive
selling by people in the cotton trade, according to the
analyst. He speculated this selling was aimed at locking in
prices for the cotton these dealers and others have on hand.
