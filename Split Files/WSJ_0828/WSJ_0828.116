   NEW YORK -- Speculation about a possible diplomatic
resolution to the Mideast crisis sent stock prices soaring in
the biggest rally this year.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 78.71, or 3.11%, to
2611.63. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange
swamped decliners 1,453 to 256.

   Contributing to the gain were a $4 drop in the price of
crude oil to $26.91 for October delivery, sharp rallies in
foreign stock markets and a powerful surge in bond prices,
all of which helped coax investors to continue the
bargain-hunting rally that began Friday. With Friday's
49.50-point gain, the Dow Jones industrials are up 5.2% from
the lowest close of the year of 2483.42 hit last Thursday.
   Yesterday's gain was the fifth-largest for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, in point terms, and the largest since the
88.12 point rebound on October 16, 1989, the session
following last year's "mini-crash."
   Broader indexes also rose sharply: Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index climbed 9.93 to 321.44, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index rose 5.13 to 176.18 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index rose 9.12 to 297.66.
   But despite 2- and 3-point jumps in several big stocks,
the rally lacked stamina. Stocks held to narrow ranges after
a powerful jump on the opening.
   In the first nine minutes of trading, the industrial
average rose 50 points -- prompting the Big Board to put its
rule on stock-index arbitrage transactions into effect.
Friday was the first time the rule took effect during a
rally. In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell stocks
and offset the trade in stock-index futures to lock in slight
price differences between the New York and Chicago markets.
   For the rest of the session, stock buying related to index
arbitrage could be completed only after the shares to be
purchased had gone down in price.
   But by the end of the first half-hour of trading, the Dow
Jones industrials were up nearly 81 points as bargain-hunters
and traders looking to cover short positions poured into the
market.
   Several big stocks, such as International Business
Machines and Procter &amp; Gamble, opened late due to delays
caused by too many buy orders. By noon volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was a hefty 98,760,000.
   But trading slowed in the afternoon, with a total of
160,150,000 shares changing hands during the day. That
compares with 199,040,000 shares Friday.
   "It was a typical bear-market, low-volume rally," said Leo
Grohowski, director of equity investment at Marinvest. Blue
chip consumer and growth stocks dominated most of the
activity. Among the most active shares were Philip Morris,
Wal Mart Stores, General Electric and Boeing. More than 2
million shares changed hands in each of those stocks.
   "There is a sense of gradualism on the buy side," said
John B. Burke, an independent trader at the Big Board. "Many
people already own these stocks" at higher prices.
   Signs of easing tensions in the Persian Gulf caused
investors to consider how the stock market will respond to
sluggish U.S. economic growth. Said Chung Lew, head trader at
Kleinwort Benson North America Inc.: "It would be foolish to
think that all of the market's {fall} was due to the Middle
East" tension.
   IBM soared 4 to 104 3/8 in Big Board composite trading of
1.6 million shares, while Procter &amp; Gamble tacked on 4 to 75
7/8 and Union Carbide advanced 1 1/4 to 16 7/8. Other issues
subject to opening delays included such institutional
favorites as Toys "R" Us, which went up 1 1/4 to 26 1/4 on
1.4 million shares; PepsiCo, which rallied 3 1/4 to 73; and
Compaq Computer, which rose 1 5/8 to 49 3/8.
   Among the 30 Dow Jones industrials, only Primerica failed
to close higher, ending unchanged at 28 1/2. Meanwhile,
General Motors rose 1 3/4 to 39 1/8, Philip Morris rose 1 1/2
to 44 3/4, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph climbed 1 1/4 to 33
1/8 and Merck soared 3 3/8 to 81.
   Despite all the buying, several analysts said they weren't
expecting to see the market make a quick recovery from its
steep drop since late July, in which the industrial average
tumbled more than 500 points after flirting with 3000.
   "This snapback rally is very much akin to {what happened}
the last time we went down 500 points" -- namely in October
1987, said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis
group at Salomon Brothers.
   Before the market can stage a sustained advance, Mr.
Spence said, "a bottoming process" will be needed that may
take a month or two to be completed. "We've done a tremendous
amount of technical damage," he said.
   Energy stocks generally held firm despite the steep drop
in oil prices, in which October crude-oil futures fell $4 a
barrel in New York trading and contracts for later months
dropped their daily price limits.
   Exxon gained 3/4 to 49 5/8, Chevron added 1/8 to 74 3/8,
Texaco went up 1/2 to 61, Mobil  rose 1/4 to 62 1/4 and Amoco
rose 3/8 to 54 3/8. In the oil-services sector, Halliburton
went up 1/8 to 52 1/8 and Schlumberger finished unchanged at
62.
   But precious-metals issues plunged along with the price of
gold, in a reversal of the "haven" buying tied to the Middle
East crisis which had boosted the issues earlier in the
month. October gold futures skidded $26.80 an ounce, to
$391.30, in New York trading
   American Barrick Resources skidded 1 7/8 to 20 1/4 as 1.4
million shares were traded. Among other gold stocks, Home
stake Mining dipped 2 1/8 to 19 3/4, Placer Dome slid 1 to 17
3/8, Hecla Mining fell 3/4 to 11 1/8, Battle Mountain Gold
lost 5/8 to 10 1/2 and ASA slid 4 3/8 to 48 1/8.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 38.32 to
908.03, scoring its fifth-largest point gain on record.
Airfreight and railroad issues paced the move; Airborne
Freight jumped 3 3/8 to 21 1/2 and Federal Express rose 2 5/8
to 39 1/2, while Norfolk Southern advanced 2 5/8 to 39 1/2
and Consolidated Rail added 2 3/8 to 36 7/8.
   USAir Group climbed 1 7/8 to 16 1/4 as the drop in oil
prices, which could eventually mean lower jet-fuel costs,
lifted the airline sector. UAL, the parent of United
Airlines, rallied 3 1/4 to 96 3/4; AMR, which owns American
Airlines, advanced 2 1/2 to 47; and Delta Air Lines rose 2
1/8 to 58 1/8.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 4.44
to 320.73. Volume totaled 17,730,000 shares.
