   NEW YORK -- Investors will soon have to fork over stiffer
fees to bring their stockbrokers to arbitration.
   In the first substantial fee change for customers since
1978, the nation's stock exchanges, squeezed for cash, are in
the process of quietly boosting the cost of filing
arbitration claims.

   The brunt of the fee increase will be borne by those
investors who bring relatively large claims. "A customer who
brings an arbitration claim for $1 million can carry his own
freight," says James E. Buck, senior vice president at the
New York Stock Exchange. "For small customers, we do
everything we can to help them."
   Until now, investors put up a "hearing deposit" when they
filed a case, ranging from $15 for the smallest claims to
$1,000 for disputes of more than $500,000. Now, the exchanges
are essentially tacking on a separate filing fee, creating a
two-tier structure. This amounts to an extra $15 for the
tiniest claims to an extra $800 for investors seeking more
than $5 million.
   The Big Board is expected to put the new fees into effect
within weeks. The arbitration arms of the nation's other
stock exchanges will soon follow suit. The National
Association of Securities Dealers, which handles nearly
two-thirds of all cases, launched the new fee schedule
several weeks ago.
   Last year, the NASD shelled out $10 million to subsidize
its arbitration program -- about 10% of its total budget --
while it took in just $3 million in fees.
   The increases are targeted at areas that cost the
exchanges the most to administer, arbitration specialists
say.
   "Now, somebody who has a big claim that requires several
sessions who is intent on going to a hearing is going to pay
the biggest part of the fees," says Richard P. Ryder, editor
of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,
newsletter.
   The specter of fatter out-of-pocket expenses in a long
case could lead customers to consider settling their cases
more quickly, Mr. Ryder says. Last year, investors settled
nearly 1,500 cases at the NASD, representing about 36% of the
cases filed there, compared with about 41% of 1989 cases
filed at the Big Board.
   Arbitration still costs less than litigation, and it is a
good thing for investors: Many stock customers sign a
standard agreement when they open a brokerage account,
binding them to go to arbitration rather than file a lawsuit
if a dispute arises.
   And even with the new price boost, it still generally
costs less to bring a case at the stock exchanges than at the
major independent forum, the American Arbitration
Association. The association, which is privately funded,
charges a fee of 3% of any claim to a maximum $25,000, with a
minimum of $300. Claims of more than $5 million cost $14,250,
plus one-tenth of 1% of the excess above $5 million at the
association.
   "The difference is the {securities} industry supports
fairly lavishly the operations of the NASD and the NYSE,"
says Robert Coulson, president of the American Arbitration
Association.
