   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- A version of the Air
Force's next-generation fighter jet, built by Northrop Corp.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp., took to the skies for the first
time yesterday, setting the stage for a showdown with another
version of the aircraft built by a rival team of aerospace
companies.
   The twin-engine YF-23, with a Northrop test pilot, Paul
Metz, at the controls, climbed to 25,000 feet, and functional
checks of basic subsystems were performed during the
early-morning, 50-minute flight. United Technologies Corp.'s
Pratt &amp; Whitney division made the engines on the YF-23.

   "The airplane flies very clean, much cleaner than we
expected," Mr. Metz said. "During the climb-out, I was using
considerably less power than I expected, and the chase
airplanes were on afterburners just to stay with me -- with
my landing gear down."
   The other team, composed of Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and
General Dynamics Corp., is scheduled to roll out its Advanced
Tactical Fighter, the YF-22, tomorrow at a Lockheed site in
Palmdale, Calif. The first flight of that plane is expected
to be next month.
   The Air Force, which wants 750 of the jets to replace the
aging F-15 fighter, is scheduled to choose the winning team
in April and award the full-scale development contract three
months later. A second YF-23, which was delivered to a test
facility here in June, will fly with General Electric Co.
engines.
