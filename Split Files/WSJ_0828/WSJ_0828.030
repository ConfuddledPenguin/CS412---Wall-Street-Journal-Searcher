   Eugene Hasenfus, a crew member on a plane shot down over
Nicaragua in 1986, lost his bid to be compensated for his
role in the White House-sanctioned Contra supply mission.
   After indicating they were deadlocked late last week,
jurors in a federal district court in Miami yesterday
rejected the former mercenary's claims. The setback followed
a blow to Mr. Hasenfus's case earlier this month, when
federal Judge C. Clyde Atkins tossed out a major portion of
his claims. That action whittled down Mr. Hasenfus's request
for compensation to only $500, according to Brian Strange, an
attorney with Strange &amp; Hoey, the Los Angeles law firm that
represented Mr. Hasenfus.

   Almost two years ago, Mr. Hasenfus sued people he claimed
had been his employers, alleging that they failed to
adequately equip the aircraft and abandoned him after his
capture by the Sandinista government.
   The suit, filed in Miami, sought unspecified damages from
Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based cargo airline, and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a key figure in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The suit alleged that Mr. Hasenfus was nominally employed
by a Pennsylvania carrier, but that Southern Air and Mr.
Secord "substantially ran the Contra resupply operation." The
jury found in favor of Mr. Hasenfus on that charge, but then
found that he wasn't eligible to be compensated.
   Mr. Hasenfus, sole survivor on the plane downed by a
heat-seeking missile, said he was "captured, imprisoned and
mentally tortured for three months" because the plane was
ill-equipped. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison by the
Sandinista government, but pardoned several weeks later and
permitted to return to the U.S.
   But even before the case went to the jury, Judge Atkins
ruled that the jurors couldn't consider damages for mental
stress suffered by Mr. Hasenfus and his wife. The judge also
threw out claims of negligence and punitive damage claims by
Mr. Hasenfus and the family of the late Wallace Sawyer Jr.,
another crew member who died on the ill-fated mission.
   Defense attorneys had argued that Mr. Hasenfus was aware
of the risks involved in the covert flight. But attorneys for
Mr. Hasenfus and the Sawyer family contended that the
couriers deserved to be compensated for working on behalf of
a White House-approved operation to support the Contra
rebels.
   Mr. Strange said he thought the judge erred in dismissing
some of the claims. "If we can raise the funds, we will
appeal the case," he said.
   Despite the jury's finding that Mr. Secord and Southern
Air had ties to Mr. Hasenfus, David Kirstein, an attorney
with the Washington, D.C., law firm of Beckman &amp; Kirstein
that represented Southern Air, said: "The bottom line is they
didn't find any liability."

   REPORTERS CAN BE FORCED to disclose nonconfidential
information.
   A Michigan appeals court in Lansing ruled that news
organizations must turn over unpublished photographs and
notes to people involved in civil lawsuits.
   It was the first time that a Michigan court has considered
whether the First Amendment protects reporters from having to
disclose nonconfidential information. And lawyers involved in
the case said they believed that the Michigan court is among
the first in the nation to refuse to recognize that any
constitutional privilege exists for nonconfidential
information.
   The decision involves the Ann Arbor News, which is owned
by Booth Newspapers Inc. of Grand Rapids and which appealed a
lower court order that it turn over 20 unpublished
photographs of a 1986 fire at an Ann Arbor video business.
   The photographs had been sought by American Employers'
Insurance Co. for use in a lawsuit brought by the business's
owner after the company rejected his insurance claim.
American Employers, a unit of Commercial Union Corp. of
Boston, contended that arson was involved.
   Most courts have ruled that the First Amendment protects
journalists from turning over information unless it is
critical to the prosecution or defense of a claim and
unobtainable elsewhere, said Thomas Leatherbury, a First
Amendment lawyer with the Dallas firm of Rocke Purnell Rain
Harrell. (Reporters are often compelled to turn over
materials in criminal cases.)
   But the appeals panel refused to recognize a qualified
privilege. In its decision last week, the panel ruled that no
privilege exists for nonconfidential information under the
First Amendment, the Michigan Constitution and the Michigan
Press Shield Law, which protects journalists from having to
disclose confidential information to grand juries.
   The panel found that journalists' traditional argument
that their ability to gather news depends upon the right to
protect confidential sources does not extend to
nonconfidential materials. And the panel said that there is
no evidence that having to produce such information would
disrupt reporters' news gathering activities.
   "The rationale for the privilege simply breaks down in a
nonconfidential situation. The source has no expectation of
privacy," said Richard Winter of the Chicago firm Clausen
Miller Gorman Caffrey &amp; Witous, a lawyer for American
Employers.
   Lee Levine, a media defense lawyer with the Washington
firm of Ross, Dixon &amp; Masback, argues that First Amendment
protections should still apply in cases involving
nonconfidential information.
   "Newspapers make editorial judgements about what to
include or exclude. Once they have decided to exclude
something, to be required to disseminate it against their
will intrudes on First Amendment freedoms," Mr. Levine said.
   The Ann Arbor News' lawyer, Jonathan Rowe of the Ann Arbor
firm of Dykema Gossett, said his client had not decided
whether to appeal.

   IMMIGRATION LAW changes to ease nursing shortage gain
ground.
   The changes are part of an immigration bill approved by
the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month to allow
more skilled immigrants into the U.S. The immigration package
hasn't been voted on by the full House.
   The rules affecting nurses are meant to correct problems
in a law passed last year to ease the severe shortage of
nurses in many U.S. hospitals. The 1989 law was expected to
enable 16,000 foreign-citizen registered nurses to remain in
the U.S. as permanent residents. But immigration lawyers and
health-care groups said many of the nurses were being
disqualified under rules adopted by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to enforce the law. For instance,
foreign nurses who did unauthorized work, such as for a
hospital other than the nurse's work-visa sponsor, were
disqualified.
   The changes adopted by the House committee would remove
that disqualification, said a spokesman for Rep. Charles
Schumer (D., N.Y.), who added new language to the bill. The
changes also would allow the nurses' families to become
permanent residents, removing another hurdle for many of the
nurses.
   The immigration package approved by the House committee
also would remove a clause that had been used to ban some gay
immigrants. An amendment introduced by Rep. Barney Frank (D.,
Mass.) would remove a list of health-related reasons under
which foreigners can be banned, including sexual deviance,
mental retardation, insanity and chronic alcoholism.
   The measure would substitute two conditions: Immigration
would be barred for drug abusers or addicts, and for anyone
with a physical or mental disorder that endangers the
individual or others.

   MERGER CONTEMPLATED by two Boston law firms.
   Gaston &amp; Snow, with 260 lawyers, is negotiating a merger
with Csaplar &amp; Bok, a Boston firm that hopes to establish a
national presence. Like many law firms of its size, 48-lawyer
Csaplar &amp; Bok decided that "we couldn't call ourselves a
national firm and be in competition with people on Wall
Street at that size," said partner Richard C. Csaplar Jr. The
law firm has shrunk by nearly 20 lawyers since the partners
decided to stop working for small local clients two years
ago.
   Gaston &amp; Snow has grown rapidly in recent years, and now
has offices in New York, Washington, San Francisco, and
Phoenix.
   The firms have been talking for two weeks and are hoping
to make a final decision by the end of September.
