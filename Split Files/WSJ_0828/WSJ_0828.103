   Berkshire Hathaway Inc., controlled by stock-picker Warren
Buffett, has a substantial holding in Champion's convertible
preferred stock.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Loews said it holds 7,326,100 Champion shares, including
shares bought from June 25 to Aug. 23 at prices ranging from
$26 to $30.375 per share.
   The shares were bought for investment reasons, Loews said.
   Late last year, Loews got what it described as "routine"
advance clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to
purchase the Champion shares as an investment. FTC clearance
was needed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for the purchase
of more than $15 million of stock.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Loews closed at $92.875, up $1.75, and Champion
closed at $27.375, up 37.5 cents.
