   WASHINGTON -- Banks continued to tighten their lending
standards in recent months, largely out of foreboding over
the economic future and the state of certain industries, a
Federal Reserve Board survey of top lending officers found.
   The results of the August survey may give the Federal
Reserve ammunition to ease interest rates slightly. The most
recent rate cut, engineered by the Fed in July, came after
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said he was worried that banks
might be turning away some worthy borrowers, thus putting an
unnecessary drag on the economy. But as reported, last week's
meeting of Fed policy makers apparently gave Mr. Greenspan
leeway to reduce short-term rates if the financial markets
settle down.

   In the Fed's survey, the first since a May report that
also found tightening credit standards, bankers reported that
they had tightened standards for loans not related to
mergers, with medium-sized businesses feeling the worst
pinch. Fully 43% of the 60 domestic banks surveyed said they
had toughened their criteria for lending to medium-sized
companies, while more than a third reported more stringent
hurdles for large and small borrowers. The Fed defines
medium-sized companies as those with annual sales of between
$50 million and $250 million.
   No banks reported easing standards for business borrowers
of any size.
   Amid the current real estate slump in nearly every region
of the country, the survey found bankers again toughening
their criteria for commercial real estate loans. About 75% of
the banks said they had imposed stiffer standards for loans
to finance commercial office buildings. In the May survey,
80% said they had tightened those standards.
   However, few banks appear to be forcing consumers applying
for home mortgages to meet tougher requirements. Only six
banks said they had tightened their standards since May, and
one bank reported easing.
   More than one-third of the banks cited a "less favorable
economic outlook" as their main reason for tightening lending
standards. The survey was taken from mid-July until Aug. 1.
Since then, many economists have begun to fear that the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait will further hurt the economy.
   About 20% said "industry-specific problems" were a factor
in the toughened standards, and about 15% noted "regulatory
pressures." The banks didn't identify which industries
presented problems.
   The Fed does about six surveys of bank lending each year.
