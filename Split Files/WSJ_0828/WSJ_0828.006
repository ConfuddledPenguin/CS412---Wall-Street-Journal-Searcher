   HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. reshuffled
top management at two subsidiaries, Carrier Corp. and Otis
Elevators.
   When the changes take place Saturday, Karl J. Krapek,
president and chief operating officer at Otis, will become
chairman, president and chief executive officer at Carrier.
He succeeds William A. Wilson, who will become a senior vice
president at United Technologies until he retires at the end
of March. Jean-Pierre van Rooy, president of Otis's North
American operations, will succeed Mr. Krapek.

   The reorganization comes as Carrier, a maker of air
conditioning and heating units, is coming under intense
competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers. United
Technologies' second-quarter results reflected an $18 million
after-tax charge for a Carrier compressor-plant closing.
Also, Carrier's profit dropped sharply because of a weak U.S.
market for residential air conditioners.
   In 1989, Carrier contributed about $4 billion of United
Technologies' $19 billion in revenue. The unit is United
Technologies' second largest subsidiary in terms of sales,
after aircraft-engine producer Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   A spokesman for United Technologies said Mr. Wilson "made
his own decision to take early retirement." The spokesman
wouldn't speculate as to why Mr. Wilson, who is 56 years old,
wants to step down and he said he had no idea what Mr. Wilson
will do afterward. Mr. Wilson's decision to retire early
prompted the changes, the spokesman said.
   Struggling to keep ahead of the competition in heating and
cooling systems, Mr. Wilson has been pushing Carrier to
improve its product line. In the past three years, Carrier
has introduced 93 products, which now account for 70% of the
company's North American sales, the spokesman said.
   United Technologies makes high-technology products and
provides services for the aerospace, automotive and building
systems industries. Otis makes elevators and escalators.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
United Technologies rose 62.5 cents to $49.375.
