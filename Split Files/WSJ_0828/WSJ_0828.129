   NEW YORK -- New American Magazine Co. is negotiating for
the possible merger of its men's magazine, Smart, with the
as-yet-unpublished Men magazine.
   Owen Lipstein, chairman of New American, confirmed that he
was discussing a possible acquisition of Men, which will
begin circulation next year. It is owned by Norris
Publishing, the Fairfield, Conn.-based company newly formed
by Christopher Kimball, former publisher of Cook's magazine,
and Peter Kaplan, the former editorial director of the
now-defunct Manhattan inc.

   Mr. Lipstein said he hopes to complete an agreement some
time next week.
   At Norris Publishing, Mr. Kimball wouldn't comment on
whether a merger would result in an entirely different
publication. Smart, a general-interest magazine for men, has
a literary bent. Men magazine has been described by Mr.
Kimball as a "field guide for men in their 20s and 30s."
   The talks come as publishers are rushing to create new
general-interest and life style magazines, with a handful of
editors jumping to new jobs at rival titles. Should the
negotiations break down, Mr. Kimball said he would follow
through with the launch of Men in early 1991. "After 25 years
of the woman's movement, men are back. The question is how
you design a magazine for that need," he said.
   Smart's Mr. Lipstein is looking to shore up the fortunes
of his two-year-old magazine. Last week, in a surprise move,
Smart's founding editor Terry McDonell was named the new
editor of Hearst Corp.'s Esquire magazine. Earlier this
month, Mr. Lipstein sold 50% of his New American Magazine Co.
to Tokyo-based Japanese Independent Communication Co.,
bringing in cash to pay debt accumulated in the 1980s.
