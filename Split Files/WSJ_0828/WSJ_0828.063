   In the 1950s, an active and sometimes vindictive and
acrimonious debate arose over the question, "Who lost China?"
In the 1990s, an active, but more civilized, debate has begun
over the question, "Why did we so badly misestimate the
Soviet economy's size and performance?"
   In "Meltdown: Inside the Soviet Economy" (Cato Institute,
Washington, D.C., 144 pages, $19.95 cloth, $9.95 paper), Paul
Craig Roberts and Karen LaFollette suggest one answer: the
predisposition of Western intellectuals "to look favorably on
societies that seem to be the antithesis of their own" led
them to view the Soviet economy through rose-tinted glasses.
Because Western intellectuals often favored centrally
planned, collectivist systems while harboring antagonism
toward marketized, capitalistic ones, they "dropped standards
of professional objectivity in their portrayal of the Soviet
regime."

   One example, among many cited by the authors, is Harvard's
John Kenneth Galbraith, who, writing in 1984, proclaimed that
"the Russian system succeeds because, in contrast to the
Western industrial economy, it makes full use of its
manpower." Evidently Mr. Galbraith had never heard the
familiar joke among Soviet workers: "We pretend to work and
they pretend to pay us."
   Of course, other answers besides those offered by Mr.
Roberts and Ms. LaFollette have been suggested. Peter
Drucker, Igor Birman, Viktor Belkin, among others, have said
simply that the Soviets typically havelied in the economic
data they've publicized. And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has
placed the onus on the CIA for overestimating the size and
growth of the Soviet economy during the past 20 years.
   Clearly, these explanations are not mutually exclusive.
Probably each has some validity.
   Only the latter portion of "Meltdown" addresses the
question of why and how the Soviet economy has been
misestimated. Most of the book is devoted to a topical
analysis of the Soviet economic system as it has actually
operated. Focusing successively on the Soviet producer and
the Soviet consumers, Mr. Roberts and Ms. LaFollette
highlight the inefficiencies, mistakes and wastage, as well
as the corruption and fraud characterizing an economy based
on quantitative norms and bureaucratized, nonmarket
decisions.
   In this system, they suggest, production "frequently
amounts to destroying the original value of . . . inputs."
Whereas, in market systems, "the production process adds
value to materials . . . in the Soviet Union the opposite is
often the case." In the process of conforming to quantitative
production norms, the consumer has little influence on either
the quantity or quality of what is produced.
   The Roberts-LaFollette style is an eclectic combination of
anecdotes, secondary source references, and commentary that
is strong in its insights and readability, and less so in its
rigor and precision. "Meltdown" occasionally vaults toward
hyperbole. For example, they assert that "no one in the
Soviet Union places any faith in economic statistics"
(although they themselves use and cite many economic
statistics with a presumption of their accuracy).
Nevertheless, their 75-page description of the Soviet economy
in operation is cogent, as well as readable.
   Still, two important caveats should be kept in mind. The
first is a reminder that, notwithstanding its inherent
weaknesses and inefficiencies, the Soviet economy has
produced and maintained massive and sophisticated military
and space capabilities. The second is that the sorry
predicament of the Soviet economy does not warrant the
conclusion, sometimes drawn by others, that the U.S. was
misguided in its defense preparations of the past 10 years.
Clearly, Soviet defense capabilities were not indefinitely
sustainable. Nevertheless, the prospect of losing them might
well have increased temptations for using them absent
countervailing capabilities in the West.
   Mr. Roberts and Ms. LaFollette also address the question
of whether the Soviet system is "redeemable." Their analysis
of prospects for economic reform emphasizes the central
importance of property rights, and they suggest several
practical ideas for accomplishing privatization: by vesting
ownership in plant workers and managers, while establishing
securities markets for trading these equities. They also
explain why price deregulation and a social "safety net" are
essential parts of the reform package, and accompany these
suggestions with the important admonition that "a market
economy cannot be established piecemeal."
   In assessing the prospects for reform, the authors
repeatedly urge reliance on and support for Mikhail
Gorbachev. This is, at best, arguable. The West may be
ill-advised to rely for systemic economic reform on one who
has repeatedly said that he does not intend "to switch the
country to capitalism," that he favors "a regulated market
economy," and that he wants to preserve and invigorate
socialism, not to supplant it.
   To be sure, one should not underestimate Mr. Gorbachev's
capacity to shift positions, and to do so with flair and
conviction. He has demonstrated this proclivity with
remarkable frequency in recent years. Nevertheless, it is at
least as appropriate to view Mr. Gorbachev as part of the
problem of achieving genuine economic reform in the Soviet
Union, as to view him as part of the solution.
