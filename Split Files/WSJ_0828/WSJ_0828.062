   ATLANTA -- BellSouth Corp.'s paging unit and CellTelCo
Nationwide Paging Partnership agreed in principle to form a
joint venture to operate a nationwide paging service.
   CellTelCo, a Memphis-based partnership that owns one of
the three licenses granted to build and operate nationwide
paging systems, will contribute its license in exchange for
50% of the new company. BellSouth's MobileComm paging unit
will provide network facilities and capital and will market
the paging service. MobileComm expects to start offering
service after reaching a definitive agreement.

approval of CellTelCo partners, the Federal Communications
Commission and other regulators.
   Also, MobileComm and Robert Blow, general partner of
CellTelCo, announced that they executed an option agreement
under which MobileComm can acquire R.B. Management Services'
20% partnership interest in CellTelCo.
