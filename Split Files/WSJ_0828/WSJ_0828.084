   Anti-tax ballot measures will be voted on in at least
eight states this November, the most since 1980. The large
number of initiatives is explained in part by a Commerce
Department report. It showed that state tax collections in
1989 were up 7.5% overall from the year before, well above
inflation. The largest gains were in Oregon and California,
up 22.5% and 14.2% respectively. Both have anti-tax votes
scheduled.
   In California, local officials have recently circumvented
Proposition 13's tax cap by passing special taxes and fees
earmarked for a specific purpose. One proposed amendment
requires a two-thirds vote of the people for such changes.
The state Legislature also would be barred from raising taxes
without a vote of the people unless two-thirds of the
lawmakers approved. California voters approved an earmarked
gasoline tax in June, but by only 52% of the vote despite the
fact that the entire political establishment endorsed it.

   Oregon has two initiatives on the ballot -- one to cap
property taxes and another to allow a tax credit of up to
$2,500 for parents sending their children to a private
school. Poor families who don't pay income tax would receive
a payment from the state, but since the state now spends
close to $6,000 on each public-school student it should save
money overall.
   Massachusetts is the only state in the nation to have
raised its taxes three years in a row. An initiative by
Citizens for Limited Taxation would repeal a 15% state
income-tax increase and all other taxes adopted after August
1989. State officials are already warning that voter approval
will mean cuts in police and fire protection. CLT leaders say
such scare tactics are akin to telling a man who has to lose
five pounds that he will have to cut off his arm instead of
going on a diet.
   Sales taxes often disproportionately hurt the poor, and
Utah tax groups are sponsoring an initiative to exempt all
food items from the state sales tax. Unless a court throws
two efforts off the ballot, Oklahomans will vote on two
initiatives to repeal an education-related tax hike and to
require that all new taxes be approved by a three-fourths
vote of the Legislature or a vote of the people.
   All the initiative sponsors had to run a gauntlet of
dubious legal challenges. In Illinois, proponents of a
measure to mandate a 60% vote in the Legislature to raise
taxes turned in more than 480,000 signatures, double what was
needed. After ballot certification, a circuit-court judge
rejected a constitutional challenge to it. Then last week,
the Illinois Supreme Court threw it off the ballot on the
grounds that it was not confined to changing the operations
of the Legislature.
   However, the overwhelming public support for the measure
has already forced both the Republican and Democratic
candidates for governor into an anti-tax corner. Within a day
of the court's ruling, both pledged they will not sign any
tax increase that doesn't meet the requirements of the
proposed amendment.
   All of the initiatives lead in the polls, but the barrage
of ads from the financially well-heeled special interests
hasn't started yet. Even so, the large number of initiatives
this year should serve as a message to both President Bush
and Congress that voter resentment over high taxes has by no
means dissipated.
