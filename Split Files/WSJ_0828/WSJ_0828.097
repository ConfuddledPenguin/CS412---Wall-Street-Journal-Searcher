   Excel Industries Inc., Elkhart, Ind., said it agreed to
purchase the door-systems division of Johnson Controls Inc.
of Milwaukee for an undisclosed amount of cash.
   The maker of windows for cars, trucks and other vehicles
said the division is expected to have annual sales this year
of $80 million. Excel said the division will boost its 1990
revenue to about $300 million. In 1989, Excel had sales of
$259.9 million.

   Johnson Controls said the sale reflects its desire to
focus on its automotive seating and related interior-systems
operations. "We don't believe we need to be in the
door-systems technology business," a spokeswoman said.
   Excel said the acquisition of door systems, which supplies
window-regulator systems for the automotive market, will
"strongly position the company in the rollup glass area." The
company said it has worked closely with the Johnson Controls
division in the past two years in developing a modular door
cartridge, which combines all internal functions of
side-window, rollup glass in a module that can be assembled
into the sheet metal door.
   The transaction is scheduled to close on Oct. 1.
