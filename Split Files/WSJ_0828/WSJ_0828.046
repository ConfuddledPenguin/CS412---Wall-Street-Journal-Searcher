   CHERRY HILL, N.J. -- Subaru of America Inc. said its
shareholders approved an agreement under which Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. of Japan will buy the 50.4% of the auto
distribution company that it doesn't already own in a
transaction valued at about $208 million.
   Under the accord, holders of Subaru, the U.S. distributor
for cars made by Fuji, will receive at least $8.50 a share --
$6 from Fuji and an additional amount equal to at least $2.50
that is expected to come from proceeds of the sale of
Subaru's portfolio of vehicle leases.

   Fuji acted to acquire all of Subaru earlier this year.
Most Japanese and European auto makers have moved in recent
years to take complete control of their U.S. distribution
operations.
