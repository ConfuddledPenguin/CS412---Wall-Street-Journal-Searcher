   DUBLIN -- Prime Minister Charles Haughey called an
emergency session of parliament for today to act on
legislation designed to protect troubled beef producers from
creditors.
   Ireland sends 44% of its beef exports to the Middle East
and North Africa, with most of that going to Iraq, Iran and
Egypt. But recent restrictions on shipments to the Persian
Gulf have cut sharply into Ireland's beef exports.

   One person who would benefit most from the proposed
legislation is Irish beef baron Larry Goodman, who is
responsible for about 50% of the country's annual 1 billion
Irish pound ($1.72 billion) beef trade. Iraq alone owes Mr.
Goodman about 180 million pounds.
   The question is how big a salvage operation the Irish
government is willing to undertake to save Mr. Goodman,
Europe's largest meat processor.
   Mr. Goodman's debts are said to be at least 50 million
Irish pounds more than his assets. He owes up to 500 million
pounds to 33 banks in Ireland, Europe, Japan, South America
and Australia, and is believed to need at least 200 million
pounds to back his day-to-day operations over the next few
months.
   The Irish government isn't expected to have any trouble
getting the new legislation passed. The measure, which is
modeled on Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, provides
for a court-appointed examiner to oversee financially ailing
companies for three months.
   Even Labor Party leader Dick Spring, who called the
legislation a bill to protect rich men from their bankers,
said Mr. Goodman "is too big a player to allow the banks to
walk in and destroy him."
