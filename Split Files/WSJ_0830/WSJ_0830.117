   TORONTO -- Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's major
commercial banks, cut its prime lending rate to 14% from
14.25% effective today.
   Canada's other commercial banks didn't immediately follow
Bank of Montreal's move.

   Lloyd Atkinson, Bank of Montreal chief economist, said a
lower prime rate was appropriate because of "the stability of
the Canadian dollar combined with evidence of weak economic
activity."
   Bank of Montreal last adjusted its prime rate Aug. 14 when
it lowered the rate one-half percentage point to 14.25%.
Canada's other commercial banks lowered their prime rates
later in the week.
