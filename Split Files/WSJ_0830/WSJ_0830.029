   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, a British beverages and sweets
manufacturer, reported a 12% rise in pretax profit on the
back of strong earnings in Europe which were partially offset
by a sharp rise in interest charges.
   Pretax profit for the six months to June 16 rose to 105
million pounds ($204 million) from 93.9 million pounds.

   Cadbury said U.K and overseas properties acquired in the
last year are making "satisfactory progress" and contributed
to the gain in earnings.
   Group sales jumped 22% to 1.41 billion pounds from 1.15
billion pounds, including record sales of 640 million pounds
in the U.K., up from 506 million pounds last year.
