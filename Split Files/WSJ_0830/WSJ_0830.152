   Egghead Inc. posted net income for its fiscal first
quarter ended July 21 of $2.1 million, or 13 cents a share,
continuing the company's improved performance.
   The profit included a gain of $569,000 on the sale of the
company's training center and a charge of $1 million for
reserves to cover actual and anticipated legal expenses. In
the year-ago period, Egghead had a loss of $5.2 million, or
32 cents a share.

   Egghead, one of the nation's largest retailers of computer
software, had a loss of $12.1 million for 1990 despite a
rapid expansion; for the second half of the year, however,
the Issaquah, Wash., company had small but increasing
profits.
   The improvements partially stem from the closure of
marginal stores and Egghead's heavier reliance on direct
sales to customers, which contributed 58% of Egghead's
revenue in the first quarter.
   Egghead's sales grew 18% to $144.7 million, compared with
$122.3 million a year ago.
