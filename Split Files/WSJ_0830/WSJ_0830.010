   BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- Bethlehem Steel Corp. said it will
reorganize certain customer service and marketing functions,
eliminating 56 customer service positions.
   When fully implemented in about two years, the changes
will save about $3 million a year, as well as provide better
service to customers, the company said.

   Customer service work currently performed at field sales
offices will be consolidated at plants in Burns Harbor, Ind.,
and Sparrows Point, Md., and at the Structural Products
division in Bethlehem, the company said.
   Also, separate marketing offices will be established for
hot and cold rolled products and coated sheet products, the
company said.
