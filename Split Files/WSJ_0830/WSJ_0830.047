   Saturday, Sept. 1, 10:30-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "AFI
Presents TV or Not TV?" an American Film Institute special
hosted by Jack Lemmon and featuring skits developed at the
AFI summer workshop. The program is the work, in short, of
aspiring comedy writers, normally a prospect to make the
blood run cold. This would be no exception but for one
laceratingly clever sketch called "Cooking With God" that
makes the whole enterprise, complete with sendups of Roseanne
Barr and "Twin Peaks," seem worth enduring. "Cooking With
God" is four minutes of wildly inspired nastiness aimed at
money-hustling television ministries. Harry Shearer stars as
the Rev. Robert Tilton, author of "The Robert Tilton Blind
Faith Cookbook," which among other things implores us to
"Accept the Lord as your personal chef."
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 9, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on HBO: "Somebody Has to
Shoot the Picture," a compelling and oddly stylish film
notwithstanding the ungainly title. Roy Scheider is at his
lachrymose best as the photographer hero drawn into the
(fictional) case of a death-row inmate facing imminent
execution despite substantial questions about his guilt. Both
a murder mystery and a raw closeup of the business of
execution, the film is unmistakably a brief against the death
penalty, but one that fortunately avoids the usual
sermonizing.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Sept. 10, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT: "The Lost
Capone." You probably didn't know Al Capone had a nice
younger brother. Well apparently he did, and TNT has
unearthed him for us, via the work of newspaper columnist
James Bacon, on whose research this quasi-biographical saga
is based. Young Jimmy Capone, it appears, shared none of the
family predilection for violence, which outraged his
soon-to-become-famous brother Al the mobster and his barber
father who was sympathetic to mobs. Young Jimmy lit out for
new territory, where, to his elderly parent's further
mortification, he became a law officer. The relatives cannot
hold their heads up for shame. Clearly this is a crime-family
version of "The Jazz Singer," wherein this youth breaks his
old father's heart by running off to become a good citizen
instead of a singer. Under the alias Richard ("Two Gun")
Hart, the wayward Capone becomes the scourge of bootleggers
out West, among them, needless to say, Brother Al. The
producers note that some aspects of this history have been
fictionalized, which is also needless to say. Eric Roberts is
a credible Al Capone, despite an Italian accent that
regularly veers off into something a lot more like a cross
between Navajo and Romanian. Nevertheless, all this is
enormously entertaining, with a noteworthy performance from
actor Titus Welliver, who extracts more from the role of
middle brother Ralph Capone than one would have thought
possible.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 12, 8-9 p.m., on CBS: "Are You Safe? A
National Test on Crime Prevention." Kevin Dobson is the host
of this grimly practical compendium of pointers on ways to
avoid becoming a crime victim. It makes use, to be sure, of
test gimmickry, with answers and points scored, but there is
nothing relaxing or gamelike about this hour, which is
chillingly evocative in its portraits of the criminal
endeavor. Nothing gets one's attention more than the sight of
criminals about to pounce, and that sight, in all its hideous
variety, from street muggings to burglary to worse (all
reenactments), is what ensures that no one will fall asleep
watching this. It also is the reason a good many citizens
watching it are likely to want to go out and get a gun,
though this clearly is not the response intended by the
producers. The program underlines and amplifies the
well-justified sense now haunting everyone's life, that crime
and danger are just around the corner, waiting to strike.
This hour is, to repeat, no barrel of laughs, but it is hard
to imagine any television program that comes closer to
peoples' real concerns than these sometimes predictable,
sometimes surprising instructions on ways to stay alive.
Watch.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 12, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E: "The 1960
National Democratic Convention." The hit of the year was
"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini," which did
not augur well for the new decade. The 1960 Democratic
Convention, which resulted in the nomination of John F.
Kennedy, brings back a lot more of the flavor of the time. It
was one of the last conventions that could still lay claim to
the appearance of a contest, as opposed to the ceremonial
annointments of today. John Chancellor narrates this
irresistible look back at a convention in which Kennedy's
competitors were, among others, Adlai Stevenson and Lyndon B.
Johnson.
