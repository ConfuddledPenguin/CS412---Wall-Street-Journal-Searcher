   Here's something you should know about that war that's
going on in the Gulf:
   Much of the news that you read or hear or see is being
censored.

   Any reporter who showed up last week in Saudi Arabia was
given a list by our military people. It said, among other
things:
   The following categories of information are not
releasable.
   (1) Number of troops.
   (2) Number of aircraft.
   (3) Number of other equipment (e.g. artillery, tanks,
radars, trucks, water "buffaloes," etc.).
   (4) Names of military installations/geographic locations
of U.S. military units in Saudi Arabia.
   (5) Information regarding future operations.
   (6) Information concerning security precautions at
military installations in Saudi Arabia.
   (7) Names/hometowns of U.S. military personnel being
interviewed {although that seems to have been relaxed over
the weekend}, and names of Saudis being interviewed.
Commanders of U.S. units being interviewed are excepted from
this provision.
   {The list omits (8).}
   (9) Photography that would show level of security at
military installations in Saudi Arabia.
   (10) Photography that would reveal the name or specific
location of military forces or installations.
   And, the rules add, "If you are not sure whether an action
you take will violate a ground rule, consult with your escort
officer PRIOR TO TAKING THAT ACTION."
   When they're on military bases occupied by U.S. troops,
reporters are constantly accompanied by U.S. military
"escorts." These escorts listen in on virtually every
interview and conversation. Censors, performing a "security
review," read the stories of some print reporters before the
pieces are filed. Censors on occasion tell TV reporters they
can't do this or that story.
   Reporters are told where they can go and can't go in Saudi
Arabia -- put simply, they can't go very many places -- and
the television reporters are forbidden from telling their
viewers just where the reporters are other than "someplace in
Saudi Arabia." When not on military bases, the reporters
often are accompanied by Saudi bureaucrats who hamper and
hinder the newsgathering.
   So what we have is this: A war, or near-war, that has not
been declared by the president, that has not been debated by
Congress, and that cannot be reported by the press. Further,
it's a three-front war, and no reporters can get into Kuwait,
the few who get into Iraq can get no meaningful information,
and those allowed into Saudi Arabia are censored.
   "At the first post-Cold War moment when we're putting
Americans in harm's way, we aren't, it seems to me, being
provided a sufficient amount of information to really engage
meaningfully in a debate about whether or not this is
appropriate," Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam Medal of Honor winner
who now is the Democratic senator from Nebraska, said on
"Meet the Press" last Sunday.
   "I know from reading the newspaper that it's hot in the
desert and that the chow is bad," he went on, and the
implication was clear: that's about all the American people,
including Congress, are being told.
   This is no way to run a war.
   Right now, the New York Times estimates, the U.S. has
about 50,000 Marines, 50,000 soldiers, three naval battle
groups, and 250 aircraft involved in Operation Desert Shield
in the Gulf. Add in the cost of 50,000 reservists who will be
joining in, and you get a war that is costing America, by
estimate of the Times, about $32 million a day.
   For $32 million a day, the government should tell us
what's going on. There is no reason -- there is no excuse --
for this kind of censorship in this undeclared and undebated
war. It is understandable why the government would want to
keep secret the most sensitive strategies of a war, but this
censorship in Saudi Arabia -- a censorship of facts, not of
plans and strategies -- exceeds even the most stringent
censorship of World War II.
   Further, it's a continuation of a trend that has been
clearly established by the Reagan and Bush administrations.
The press was shut out of Grenada, cooped up in Panama, and
put on the late plane into Saudi Arabia.
   At the moment, this huge buildup of men and machines has
the support of the American people and of the young men and
women who are being dispatched. That's the understandable
first blush of patriotism, the instinct to rush in and get
the bad guys. If the war goes on, though, all that will
change: The troops will tire of the war -- the boredom of
waiting or the horror of fighting -- and Americans will tire
of its costs.
   Only one thing can change this: facts.
   And right now, at least, that's the one weapon the
Pentagon has no use for.
