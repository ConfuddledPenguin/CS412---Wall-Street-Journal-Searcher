   Perkin-Elmer Corp. reported a 3% increase in net income
for the fourth quarter ending July 31 as sales rose 7.4%,
reflecting successful restructuring efforts completed during
fiscal 1990.
   Perkin-Elmer, which manufactures analytical instruments
used in material-science laboratories, reported quarterly net
income rose to $13.6 million, or 38 cents a share, from $13.2
million, or 30 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Per-share earnings reflect the company's buy-back of 10.1
million of its common shares.

Conn., company.
