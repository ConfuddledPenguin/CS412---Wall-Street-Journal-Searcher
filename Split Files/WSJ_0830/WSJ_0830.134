   CHICAGO -- GATX Corp. said its aircraft-leasing joint
venture with France's Credit Lyonnais agreed to obtain $400
million in additional capital from new Japanese and U.S.
investors.
   The move will trim the two original partners' stake to 30%
each, GATX said.

   The new investors -- Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Nichimen Corp.,
and Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Japan; and the Household Commercial
Financial Services unit of Household International Inc. --
each received a 10% interest in the venture, and committed to
invest $100 million apiece.
   GATX and Credit Lyonnais began the aircraft-leasing
venture, known as GATX/CL Air, in 1988, with total funding of
$1 billion. The funds were used to acquire aircraft that are
leased to certain South American airlines, and for 20 Airbus
A320-200 jets to be delivered to other airlines over the next
several years.
   GATX said it anticipates the new financing will be used to
acquire additional aircraft.
   GATX has interests in railcar and aircraft leasing,
financial services, and bulk liquid terminal storage.
