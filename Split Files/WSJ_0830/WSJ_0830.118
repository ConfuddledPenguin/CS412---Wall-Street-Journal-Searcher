   AMAX Inc. and its 87%-owned Amax Gold Inc. said they filed
a registration statement for a secondary offering of at least
9.5 million shares of Amax Gold. At yesterday's New York
Stock Exchange closing price for Amax Gold common of $16.875,
the sale would raise about $160 million for the parent
company. Thomas McKeever, Amax executive vice president, said
the New York-based energy and mining company would use the
proceeds for general corporate purposes. Under the offering,
Amax would sell 9.5 million units consisting of one share and
a warrant to buy another share of Amax Gold. If all the
shares are sold and the warrants exercised, Amax's stake in
Amax Gold would be reduced to 55%. If the warrants aren't
exercised, the parent would continue to hold about 71% of
Denver-based Amax Gold. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is the
lead underwriter.
