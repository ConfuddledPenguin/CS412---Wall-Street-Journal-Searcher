   "Darkman" doesn't have a crackerjack plot -- though it
does have five screenwriters. At times director Sam Raimi
constructs shots that are almost deliriously corny; for
example, standing his heroine in front of a background that
changes from a burning building to a cemetery as she glistens
in the foreground like a giant cutout doll. The
characterizations are undeniably melodramatic.
   Yet there is great giddy pleasure to be found in this
peppy Gothic thriller. Mr. Raimi got his start doing
low-budget horror films ("The Evil Dead" and its sequel), and
has carried the unbridled nuttiness of the genre to this more
mainstream picture. As, for instance, when Darkman forces an
adversary's head up through a manhole in the middle of a busy
street; the man bobs in traffic until he is flattened. Mr.
Raimi has shot this scene, and the entire movie, with a fluid
visual wit that sustains the mood through some implausible
turns in the story.

   Indeed, "Darkman," an original film that seems very
familiar, has captured the moody romanticism of certain comic
book heroes without losing a sense of fun. Mr. Raimi hasn't
weighed the material down with the somber self-importance of
"Batman" or the pretty dullness of "Dick Tracy."
   Mr. Raimi is in top form with his villains, a great
assortment of geeks and brutes who can be bad in horrendously
imaginative ways. The main baddie specializes in guillotining
fingers with a cigar cutter, then collecting his trophies in
a velvet-lined box, as if it were Mother's best sterling.
   This scary fellow with the hard eyes, Durant, is one of
the movie's strangest surprises: He's played -- extremely
well -- by Larry Drake, best known as Benny, the mentally
retarded clerk on "L.A. Law" who periodically is trotted out
rather cynically to demonstrate that the show's careerist
characters really do have heart.
   "Darkman" begins life as Dr. Peyton Westlake, an earnest
research scientist on the verge of developing perfect
synthetic skin. He punches data into a computer and noses
float through the air -- then melt. He's also on the verge in
his personal life. He wants to get married to his girlfriend,
a perky lawyer named Julie. She says she loves him but she's
not quite ready to stick around either.
   Julie works for a real estate developer whose evil doings
become the catalyst for the creation of Darkman. The details
don't matter. It's enough to know that thugs blow up Peyton's
laboratory with him in it. Enough of him survives for him to
re-create himself as a character openly modeled on the
Phantom of the Opera, and to take his revenge.
   Irish actor Liam Neeson ("The Good Mother," "Suspect")
plays Peyton and the tortured Darkman as near to the top as
possible without going over, which seems entirely appropriate
for this operatic role. Mr. Neeson allows this creature, who
takes no pleasure in his revenge, dignity and poignancy that
don't seem cartoonish at all. Frances McDormand does what she
can with the relentlessly stalwart Julie, who is allowed one
amusing line: "If you're not going to kill me I have things
to do."

   The late Jim Thompson wrote 29 novels in the '50s. His
tough, pulpy literature was filled with neurotics, psychotics
and con men trying to paper over their nowhere lives with big
schemes. The schemes inevitably failed, and ended in violent
death.
   Movie makers have long been attracted to Thompson's gritty
vision, and he wrote a few screenplays himself. The tough
talk of Thompson's drifters and whacked-out dreamers can be
wonderful in the right hands. It also can seem oblique and
pretentious.
   An example of the oblique and pretentious Thompson
currently is available in director James Foley's new film,
"After Dark, My Sweet," based on a Thompson novel published
in 1955.
   Mr. Foley has done much to blur and sentimentalize this
story of a former boxing champ and mental patient who shows
up somewhere one day. Collie hooks up with a widowed dame
named Fay (Thompson's women inevitably are dames and more
than one is named Fay) and a con artist called Uncle Bud. He
sleeps with Fay and agrees to go along with Uncle Bud's plans
to kidnap a rich young boy.
   Like the plans of many Thompson character's, Uncle Bud's
isn't terribly well conceived, and even if it were, something
would happen to throw it off. Here, the little boy has
diabetes.
   There is inherent interest in the situation that Mr. Foley
manages to undercut with annoying soft-focus of thought and
camera. He encourages his actors to overdo everything, which
means a lot of neck-popping and eye-rolling on the part of
everyone. Pudgy Jason Patric, as Collie, has no edge at all,
while Rachel Ward's Fay is nothing but edges. She looks very
hungry. It's hard to know what Bruce Dern is doing as Uncle
Bud. Mr. Foley's attention seems to be occupied mainly with a
large table lamp in Fay's living room, the only object that
is framed nicely whenever it appears onscreen.

   "My Blue Heaven" is interesting as an example of how
talented or at least experienced people can spend a great
deal of time, money and effort on a movie that fails
consistently, in almost every single scene. The movie,
written by Nora Ephron and starring Steve Martin and Rick
Moranis, is billed as a comedy, though you will find yourself
wondering why Carol Kane appears briefly, and why she
disappears.

   The British director Nicolas Roeg has specialized over the
years in bizarre fantasies, sexual and otherwise, that rarely
made sense in any conventional way but that always were
fascinating to see. Now he's made his most coherent movie, a
nasty fairy tale called "Witches," in which Anjelica Huston
plays a vampy witch whose goal is to turn the children of
England into mice. It's a diabolical giggle, though parents
should know that in order for the little hero's kindly
grandmother to help him save the day, his parents must die.

   VIDEO TIP: Jim Thompson's unblinking vision needed to be
put on screen by a director with a tough-minded intelligence
and a cool eye and a sense of humor. Stanley Kubrick has all
of them, and had them even as a young director, when he made
"The Killing" in 1956. Sterling Hayden is great, the
mastermind behind a racetrack heist. There is a dame named
Fay, too. And Thompson and Kubrick teamed up again for "Paths
of Glory," the first of Kubrick's cynical, powerful anti-war
pictures.
