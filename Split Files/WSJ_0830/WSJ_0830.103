   NEW YORK -- CBS News is exploring the possibility of
producing a late-night program to focus on the crisis in the
Middle East.
   If the program succeeds, a new half-hour series produced
by CBS News could remain on the air to compete with ABC
News's "Nightline."

   The show could be anchored by CBS News correspondent
Charles Kuralt. Company insiders said that chief White House
correspondent Lesley Stahl also might have a role. The
experiment began last night with a special CBS News broadcast
featuring an exclusive interview by anchorman Dan Rather with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   In an interview, Eric Ober, who was named president of CBS
Inc.'s news division last week, confirmed the plans. Talks
about a half-hour CBS News program that would be aired at
11:30 p.m. in most time zones began last week when CBS
Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer decided to remove
CBS News President David W. Burke and replace him with Mr.
Ober, who was president of the CBS-owned television stations
division.
   "CBS News is looking seriously at time periods for
expansion, and 11:30 p.m. is one under consideration," Mr.
Ober said.
   Mr. Ober declined further comment, but other people at CBS
News, who didn't want to be quoted by name, said CBS has no
firm plan for a regular nightly series at 11:30. The division
is taking a "wait and see" attitude, they said.
   CBS News's plans come as network news divisions are
devising new ways to boost revenue. For example, ABC News is
considering an overnight newscast, perhaps to begin on
Election Day in November. ABC News said it was exploring this
possibility at the request of its more than 200 affiliates.
   CBS's television network long has been frustrated in the
financially lucrative late-night arena, most recently by its
big-budget flop, "The Pat Sajak Show." With its
action-adventure shows, CBS runs a poor third behind "The
Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" on General Electric Co.'s
NBC network and "Nightline" on Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC
network.
   At stake is a share of the $429 million in ad revenue
earned by the three major broadcast networks in the 11:30
p.m. to 2 a.m. period.
   It was another crisis facing U.S. citizens, the hostage
situation in Iran more than 10 years ago, that was
responsible for the creation of "Nightline." ABC News's
series of nightly reports on the 1979-80 Iranian hostage
crisis evolved into the highly respected late-night news
program.
   The ratings of "Nightline," which generally finishes No. 2
in its time period, soar when a major news event occurs. For
instance, A.C. Nielsen Co.'s ratings for "Nightline" have
climbed 27% since the Middle East situation began.
   CBS News already produces a two-hour overnight program,
"Nightwatch." When Mr. Burke was removed last week after just
two years, CBS officials said privately that he wasn't
"creative" enough and didn't "energize" the beleaguered news
division, which has suffered rounds of layoffs and budget
cutbacks since 1985.
   But individuals at CBS said that CBS News's annual
operating budget, estimated at $340 million, will increase
next year.
   CBS News had been hoping for millions of dollars in ad
revenue from a new series, "Face to Face With Connie Chung,"
which the network scheduled for one of its best time periods,
Mondays at 10 p.m.
   But last month, Ms. Chung unexpectedly canceled her own
series, and instead would like to air periodic specials,
because she wants to try to have a child. That move cost CBS
News millions of dollars, insiders have said.
