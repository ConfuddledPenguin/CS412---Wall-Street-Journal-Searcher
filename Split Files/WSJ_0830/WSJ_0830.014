   Ladbroke Group PLC, a London hotel, retailing and betting
concern, reported a 12% rise in pretax profit for the first
six months of the year, led by strong growth in its Hilton
International hotels chain.
   Pretax profit for the half year ending June 30 increased
to 158 million pounds ($307 million) from 141 million pounds.
However, the gain left earnings slightly below market
forecasts, which ranged between 160 million and 170 million
pounds.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests firmed to 112
million pounds, a rise of 15% from 97.1 million pounds a year
earlier. Per-share earnings rose 15% as well to 13.1 pence
from 11.4 pence.
