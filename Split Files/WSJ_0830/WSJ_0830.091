   GLEN ROCK, N.J. -- Citizens First Bancorp Inc. said it met
with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, its outside auditor, to "review the
circumstances" of loans to a Coopers partner that are in
default.
   Citizens and Coopers declined to name the partner, specify
the size of the loans or indicate when the default occurred.
But, raising questions about a potential conflict of
interest, Citizens said in a statement that Coopers, which is
based in New York, "will promptly take a special in-depth
review" of its audit work and the partner's involvement.

   The partner wasn't directly responsible for auditing
Citizens' financial statement but acted in a secondary review
capacity, the statement said. The loans, from the Citizens
First National Bank of New Jersey unit, were not in default
at the time.
   Coopers "remains confident that its audits were properly
conducted and that Citizens' financial statements are fairly
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles," the statement said.
   Rodney Verblaauw, Citizens' president, said in an
interview that the bank had provided for the unsecured
portions of the partner's loans as part of a $70 million loan
loss provision taken in the second quarter. He termed the
personal loans in question "inconsequential in terms of the
overall picture," saying they amounted to "no more than"
several hundred thousand dollars.
   Citizens, the holding company for the 51-branch bank unit,
reported a net loss for the second quarter of $34.5 million
because of the $70 million loan loss reserve. For 1989, the
company reported earnings of $37.1 million on revenue of
$289.3 million. Its assets totaled $3 billion at July 31.
   Pending completion of the Coopers investigation, due
within two weeks, Mr. Verblaauw said he wasn't concerned "at
this time" about a conflict created by the partner's loans.
   Accountants and their clients usually take great care to
avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Professional
standards typically prohibit accountants from holding an
ownership interest in an audit client, and certain other
business relationships -- while not forbidden -- must be
undertaken with caution, said John C. Burton, a professor of
accounting at Columbia Business School and former chief
accountant with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In the case of an accountant holding loans from a bank
whose audits he oversees, Mr. Burton said "it might be more
sensible to borrow from someone else to avoid the appearance
of impropriety."
   "If there is any business relationship between the partner
and the client, it would create an independence problem," Mr.
Burton said. "Then there would be a question of whether the
audit was an independent audit."
