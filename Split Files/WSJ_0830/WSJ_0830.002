   ("Technology Now Keeps Caller From Feeling Alone" --
headline)
                                                                                                       

   The caller of a bygone day,
   Who twiddled his thumbs when told,
   "Your party's on another line,"
   Is now serenaded on hold.
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   As time passes by
   It is shocking to see
   That I'm starting to look
   Less and less like me.

   Considering the spate of tell-all books on the market,
it's safe to say that exposes are at an all-time peek.
