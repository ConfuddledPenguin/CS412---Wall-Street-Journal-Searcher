   I read with interest your July 19 "Lawyers Who Switch
Sides Draw Ire With Big Checks." It raises questions about
the relationship between attorney and client.
   Jerry Jackson, formerly with the National Wildlife
Federation and now with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom
is undertaking the defense of what appears to be a state
agency that has been accused of polluting the environment.

   While it would be unethical of Mr. Jackson to comment on
the particular case strategy absent a release from his
client, he could hypothesize as to whether he would "defend"
clients who are clearly wrong, or if he felt that his
obligations under his public trust as an attorney would
either compel him to decline the engagement or ensure that
his obligation as an attorney was not in conflict with his
client's objectives. This is especially true where the
conduct alleged to be in error is continuing.
   Barbara Brown, the women's rights attorney now
representing corporations in sex-discrimination matters,
might have been asked what she would do if, upon independent
investigation by her, she found her corporate client had
indeed done the dastardly deeds outlined in the complaint.
Would she tell her client to settle and pay up, or defend to
the bitter end if that is what the client desired?
   There is a fine line that separates ethics and advocacy,
and many times a substantial fee or career walks along that
line with you.
   Where one stands on those types of issues is the real test
of character.
