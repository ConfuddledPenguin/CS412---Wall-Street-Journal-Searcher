   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan boosted its benchmark interest
rate Thursday, taking what some economists warned could be an
internationally risky step to avert inflation at home.
   The central bank said it would raise its discount rate
0.75 percentage point to 6.0%, effective immediately. The
discount rate is the amount the central bank charges on loans
to financial institutions.

   The increase was the fifth since authorities started
tightening official credit in May 1989. The last time the
discount rate was at this level was Dec. 11, 1981, when the
Bank of Japan lowered it to 5.5% from 6.25%.
   More critically to the rest of the world, though, the rate
change was the first since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug.
2 sent oil prices soaring and threw most countries' economic
plans into limbo.
   And Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno suggested it
might not be the last rate increase if the crisis continues.
   Mr. Mieno said the central bank hoped its action would
help sustain, not derail, economic growth. "Under these
circumstances at home and abroad we concluded that we had to
act at this time to ensure continued stable growth," he said.
   By raising the discount rate, the Bank of Japan said it
hoped to ward off inflation at home. The bank said in a
statement that the decision to raise the rate reflected
domestic economic concerns, including a tight labor market,
rapidly expanding money supply and rising money market
interest rates. Unstated was the worry uppermost in many
officials' minds here that high oil prices eventually could
translate into inflation in Japan, a country that imports 99%
of its oil. People in Japan still refer to the 1973 and 1979
oil crises as "shocks."
   But coming in the midst of the crisis in the Middle East
and a slowing U.S. economy, some analysts warned that the
Bank of Japan's decision could prove too focused on domestic
concerns -- and harmful to the international economy.
   "If it causes any upward pressure in rates
internationally, it could be very bad," said Keikichi Honda,
director of economic research at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
   Japanese policy makers were presented with an agonizing
conundrum. At issue was whether, with rates in the Japanese
credit market already rising, authorities should push
interest rates higher. Higher interest rates probably will
succeed in forestalling inflation with the domestic economy
expanding rapidly -- many economists expect it to grow nearly
5% this year. Japan's annualized inflation rate during June,
as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.2%.
   But Japan's effort to hold down its relatively tame
inflation could be the nail in the U.S. economy's coffin when
many are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a
U.S. recession. Policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve
have been leaning toward a modest easing of credit. Fed
officials suggest, however, that they won't move to cut
short-term interest rates until financial markets settle
down.
   Higher Japanese interest rates would compound Washington's
problem by making it harder for the U.S. authorities to lower
rates. Japanese investors already have grown weary of funding
the U.S. debt when they can obtain equivalent returns on
Japanese government bonds.
   In an interview before the rate change, Tomomitsu Oba,
president of the Japan Center for International Finance and a
former vice minister of finance, warned that if Japan raises
rates too quickly, "the world economy will be facing a very,
very serious problem."
   So delicate is the economic balance that analysts Thursday
morning were speculating that Mr. Mieno, the central bank
governor, must have discussed the rate change in advance with
U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. Mieno himself said
Wednesday that he was taking "international" considerations
into account in setting Japan's monetary policy. Bank of
Japan officials wouldn't elaborate on their statement
announcing the rate change.
   The world's financial markets are acutely sensitive to the
dangers, though. Rumors this week that the Bank of Japan was
considering a discount-rate increase pushed the yen to its
highest levels of the year. Wednesday, markets were upset
again by leaks in the Japanese media that the central bank
had begun discussions with the Ministry of Finance on raising
the rate by 0.75 percentage point to one point. The reports
cited worries about the inflationary effects of higher world
oil prices resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and
of tight labor conditions in Japan.
   Although the Bank of Japan moved aggressively to squelch
any such speculation, its announcement Thursday that the rate
indeed would rise gave mild reassurance to the markets. But
the stock market gave back most of its early gains, finishing
up 34.68 points at 24929.47. It had been up more than 300
points earlier.
   "They kind of caught people off guard after denying it"
Wednesday, said Mike Morizumi, a strategist in Tokyo for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "But people are basically
accepting it."
   Only a day earlier, reports of a possible increase in the
discount rate had crushed a three-session recovery on the
beleaguered Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei index plunged
815.97 points, or 3.17%, to 24894.79.
   Now, analysts say, the great fear is that Thursday's rate
change won't be the last. In a news conference Thursday
morning, Mr. Mieno hinted that there could be more, saying
that the situation in the Persian Gulf would require flexible
monetary policy.
   "The prospect of war is so close," said Richard Koo, an
economist at Nomura Securities Co.'s research affiliate. "It
would be much worse if they tried to raise rates now, a war
starts, oil prices rise, and they have to do it again."
