   Brunswick Corp., Skokie, Ill., said it expects to report a
one-time gain of $45 to $50 million from dispositions of
non-defense, Technical businesses in 1990.
   Such a gain would represent about 51 cents a share to 57
cents a share, the maker of marine and recreation products
said.

   "We are concluding key transactions and have sufficient
information to approximate the gain," the company said. The
dispositions are part of Brunswick's previously announced
plans to sell its Technical segment's Industrial Products and
Technetics divisions.
   Net proceeds from dispositions, which could range from
$120 million to $150 million "depending on which transactions
are closed," will be used to pay down debt, Brunswick said.
   For the first six months, Brunswick had net income of
$34.2 million, or 39 cents a share, on sales of $1.36
billion.
