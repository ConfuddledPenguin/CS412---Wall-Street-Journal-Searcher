   TOKYO -- Japan's steel exports dropped 15% in July from a
year ago, continuing a five-year trend of year-on-year
declines, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported.
   Steel exports were particularly lower to China, Taiwan,
South Korea, the Soviet Union and the U.S., a federation
spokesman said, although domestic demand continued to buoy
business for Japanese producers.
