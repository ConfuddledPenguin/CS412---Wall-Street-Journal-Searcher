   WASHINGTON -- The savings-and-loan bailout agency has
chosen an Alexandria, Va., real estate firm to manage $2.4
billion of real estate and loans seized from a Houston
thrift, government and private-sector sources said.
   If a contract to oversee and sell the properties is
finalized with the management firm, J.E. Robert Co., it would
be the first major asset-management contract awarded by the
Resolution Trust Corp. It also is likely to be one of the
largest single blocks of assets the agency puts under a
management contract.

   The package is made up of thousands of loans and
properties previously held by University Savings Association
of Houston. The government seized the thrift, which was one
of the bigger failed savings and loans, and it was sold last
October to banking firm NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., for $129
million. NCNB, however, assumed the thrift's deposits and
left most of the assets in the hands of the government. NCNB
has been managing the properties under an interim contract.
   Among the assets are delinquent commercial real estate
loans, shopping centers, hotels and land. Under the contract,
J.E. Robert would prepare the properties to be sold. In the
case of loans, that includes the arduous legal process of
foreclosing on the loans and sorting out other claims so that
the government can sell the properties.
   It wasn't known how much J.E. Robert bid to manage the
properties, but generally the asset manager receives an
annual fee of about 0.5% of the total value of the properties
and then anywhere from 1.5% to 4% of the sales price. Thus,
the value of the contract could be $100 million or more if it
lasts four or five years.
   RTC officials have said they expect to have $20 billion to
$30 billion of real estate and real estate loan assets under
management contract by year's end. As of June 30, the RTC had
total assets of $165.3 billion, but about $120 billion of
that was in securities and performing mortgages that the
agency finds easier to sell than the real estate and
delinquent loans that generally will make up the packages put
under contract.
   Joseph Robert, president of J.E. Robert, declined to
comment.
   A spokesman for the RTC also wouldn't comment on whether
J.E. Robert had been selected, but he said, "Our
asset-management program has been established now, and we
expect to be regularly awarding contracts in the weeks
ahead."
   The agency had a false start with the asset-management
program this year after many firms protested that the RTC's
process of randomly narrowing the field of bidders was
"irrational." The RTC changed the system to try to take the
experience of the bidders more into account.
   Separately, the RTC said it agreed to sell $379.2 million
of residential mortgage loans to Lehman Capital Corp. The
portfolio of 5,246 fixed-rate first mortgages, which were
assets of Horizon Financial, Southampton, Pa., will be sold
for 98.25% of the unpaid principal balance on the day of
settlement, expected within three weeks.
