   STOCKHOLM -- AB Investor and AB Providentia, key holding
companies in Sweden's Wallenberg group, exercised an option
to buy a 22% voting stake in Saab-Scania AB in a transaction
valued at 4.3 billion Swedish kronor ($751.3 million).
   The move, which was expected, boosted the Wallenberg
group's voting stake to 58% in Saab-Scania, an auto and
aerospace group. The transaction rekindled market speculation
that the Wallenbergs plan to take Saab-Scania private in what
would be Sweden's biggest-ever leveraged buy-out.

   Expectations of such a buy-out have buoyed the price of
Saab-Scania shares amid volatile, declining markets here in
recent weeks. Saab-Scania B-free shares, the series most
traded internationally, rose 10 kronor ($1.747) during the
past week but closed unchanged at 250 kronor yesterday on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange.
   Investor and Providentia said they are seeking "to create
an ownership structure able to optimize Saab-Scania's
long-term development potential." The companies added that
"this process is continuing" but declined to elaborate.
   The option pact completed yesterday dates from late April.
At that time, Investor and Providentia agreed to pay a hefty
premium over prevailing market prices for Saab-Scania stock
to dispose of a big, unfriendly holder, Sven-Olof Johansson,
a Stockholm property tycoon. Mr. Johansson had assembled the
Saab-Scania holding through aggressive market purchases over
several months.
   However, the Wallenbergs, who had held sway in
Saab-Scania's boardroom for decades, rebuffed Mr. Johansson's
requests for board representation. That soured relations. And
when the investor threatened to offer his Saab-Scania stake
to other, potentially hostile Swedish investors, Investor and
Providentia stepped in with a pre-emptive bid.
   The holding companies said financing for the purchase of
Mr. Johansson's stake would be arranged in both Swedish and
international capital markets. The Saab-Scania transaction is
only one of several completed by the Wallenberg group this
year. For instance, Investor and Providentia provided 25% of
the financing for affiliate Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB's
4 billion mark ($2.57 billion) takeover of West Germany's
Feldmuehle Nobel AG in May.
