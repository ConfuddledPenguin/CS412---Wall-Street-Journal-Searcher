   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. and two other defense
contractors displayed a prototype of their candidate in the
competition to build the Air Force's next-generation fighter
jet.
   The winner of the contest between two proposed versions of
the so-called Advanced Tactical Fighter, or ATF, eventually
would replace the aging F-15s that have been pressed into
service in the Middle East.

   The first YF-22, as the new Lockheed plane is known,
wouldn't be available for use by the military until the
beginning of the next decade. By that time, both company and
Pentagon officials stress, the F-15 will be nearly 30 years
old, and many Third World nations are expected to have added
to their arsenals today's top-of-the-line Soviet fighters,
the MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker. Already, 11 countries
possess the former.
   The YF-22, which Lockheed is manufacturing with Boeing Co.
and General Dynamics Corp., is competing with a YF-23 built
by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The Northrop
plane made a 50-minute maiden flight earlier this week,
climbing to 25,000 feet and flying at 333 miles an hour.
   "As current events demonstrate, there are those in the
world willing to test American resolve and readiness," said
Gen. Ronald Yates, who runs the Air Force Systems Command.
"That, in a broad sense, is why we need the ATF."
   In an interview, YF-22 program chief Sherman Mullin said
the fighter is tentatively set to make its first flight on
Sept. 14, but Air Force officials insisted yesterday that
they didn't want to be pinned down on an exact date. Lockheed
Chairman Daniel Tellep reiterated the company's strongly held
view that the victor on the ATF won't be "he who flies first,
but he who flies best."
   The ATF, through a unique combination of speed, agility,
range and stealthiness, is designed to take and maintain
control over enemy airspace, providing ground troops and
ships with safe room to maneuver in battle. "It will preserve
our security well into the next century," Gen. Yates
asserted.
   But, in the eyes of many lawmakers, the federal budget
deficit remains as much of a threat as potential Third World
aggressors. And at a projected $51 million per aircraft -- a
40% higher price tag than that carried by the most advanced
model of the F-15 -- it's doubtful to many that the Pentagon
will ever be authorized to buy all of the 750 ATFs that it
now says it needs. The Navy also wants its own variant of the
ATF, and currently has plans to procure 546 of them to
replace the F-14.
   The YF-22, which was presented while Wagner's "Ride of the
Valkyries" blared over a speaker system, in some respects
resembles Lockheed's F-117 Stealth fighter, with its angular
airframe. In fact, Mr. Mullin called it "loosely speaking,
the son of the F-117." With four tails and stubby wings, the
aircraft also has a far different appearance from the rival
YF-23. It is shorter than the Northrop plane, which features
a more cigar-shaped fuselage: 64 feet, 2 inches, vs. 67 feet,
four inches.
   The stakes are high for all the companies involved,
including engine makers General Electric Co. and United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, with this being
seen as the Defense Department's last major airplane project
of the century that is still up for grabs. "You don't have to
be a Rhodes Scholar to see that the military-aircraft
business is compressing," Mr. Mullin said. "The loser is
going to be hit very hard."
   Still, Mr. Mullin said that even with expected cuts and
stretch-outs in the defense budget, Lockheed can foresee the
ATF generating as much as $100 billion in revenue for its
team over the years between the Air Force and Navy
requirements. "Admittedly, there is no guarantee that is
going to happen," Mr. Mullin said. "But we just can't
envision the production of 1970-era airplanes in the year
2000."
   Collectively, the industry has sunk more than $1.3 billion
into the 54-month demonstration-and-validation phase of the
ATF program, meaning that even if Mr. Mullin's rosy
assessment is correct, it would take about 10 years for the
winners just to recover their investment. Major
subcontractors on the project have contributed another $800
million or so.
   The ATF "would be a nice piece of business for us," said
William Anders, vice chairman at General Dynamics. B. Daniel
Pinick, president of Boeing's defense and space group, said
that for his company, the YF-22 "meets one of our long-term
objectives: to be a maker of tactical aircraft."
   "The reason for that is simple," he added. "If you look at
where defense dollars around the world are going, it is into
these types of planes."
   But the success of the YF-22 is clearly most important for
Lockheed. Although Mr. Tellep asserted that winning the ATF
is "not make it or break it for Lockheed aircraft
activities," the company's historic role as a major supplier
of U.S. warplanes would almost surely be threatened by a loss
of this business. Although the YF-22 roll-out ceremony at
Lockheed's factory here was at times drowned out by riveting
on P-3 aircraft, most of the company's major lines have wound
down or are slated to do so soon. In addition, the Navy
recently terminated the company's contract to build the
successor to the P-3, the P-7.
