   NEW YORK -- Johnathan Rodgers was named president of the
five television stations owned by CBS Inc., inheriting a
division with a decidedly uneven performance.
   Mr. Rodgers, 44 years old, will guide the division from
Chicago, where he served as general manager of CBS-owned
WBBM. As expected, he was chosen to succeed Eric Ober, who
was named president of CBS News last week.

   The CBS-owned TV stations in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago and Philadelphia have a combined cash flow of about
$170 million. Its Miami station, WCIX, is losing several
million dollars a year and has signal problems.
   "CBS stations are laggard but extremely profitable," said
John Kornreich, analyst with Sandler Capital Management.
"They could be even more profitable and contribute more
heavily to CBS's bottom line, but they have to better deliver
the audience share."
   CBS has major headaches at KCBS in Los Angeles, where Mr.
Rodgers once served as news director and station manager.
Among the three network-owned stations in the city, KCBS
ranks a poor third, especially during the early-evening
newscast. (Local news programs provide stations with most of
their revenue.)
   WBBM in Chicago is a strong No. 2, though it finishes a
distant third during the late local news. That probably
results, however, from the CBS network's weak prime-time
schedule delivering a small audience -- a problem plaguing
CBS stations and affiliates all over the country. Although
WCAU in Philadelphia is ranked No. 2 from sign-on to
sign-off, most of its local newscasts are rated lower. WCBS
in New York has solidly improved, although it's still a
distant No. 2 to powerhouse WABC, owned by Capital Cities/ABC
Inc.
   "Certainly the stations group is not in great shape," said
Richard A. Kurlander, vice president and director of
programming at Petry Television Inc., a firm that advises TV
stations. "CBS rarely brings in people from the outside, so
it gets too inbred. But Rodgers is an excellent manager who I
expect will do a good job."
   Mr. Rodgers is an easygoing, affable executive who joined
WBBM in 1986 after serving as an executive at CBS News. He is
known for a demanding yet relaxed management style. For
example, he implements a strict "dress down" Friday policy;
that is, he encourages wearing blue jeans to the office.
   Mr. Rodgers said in an interview that he believes his role
is to "allow general managers to get their own job done" and
to allow the stations to operate independently. The most
important job for the CBS stations is "program acquisitions,"
he said. Because stations can no longer win 40% audience
ratings, he said, "we have to go after programs that will get
not only a 20 share but the right 20 share, meaning the right
demographics."
   With the exception of KCBS in Los Angeles, the CBS-owned
stations made several major purchases of syndicated product
for the 1990-91 TV season, which begins next month.
   WCBS, for instance, bought "Entertainment Tonight,"
syndicated by Paramount Communications Corp. And the four
stations purchased "Trump Card," syndicated by Warner Bros.
Television, a division of Time Warner Inc.
