   NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. reclaimed its rank of
No. 1 program trader on the New York Stock Exchange.
   While some other brokerage firms continue to shy away from
computer-aided program strategies, Kidder has used advanced
technology to overtake Morgan Stanley Group Inc. as the most
active program-trading firm, averaging 13.6 million shares
traded weekly since early July. Most striking, Kidder now
accounts for one-third of all stock-index arbitrage activity,
the most disputed form of program trading.

   While program traders don't agree on this, critics have
blamed index arbitrage for exacerbating big market plunges,
including the 1987 stock market crash and last October's
190-point minicrash.
   Executives and traders at Kidder argue that their program
trading -- most of it for the firm's own account, rather than
for customers -- is being done responsibly, in ways that
don't disrupt the markets. And the firm needs the profits,
after posting a net loss of $23 million last year.
   But the stepped-up program activity could cause public
relations problems for Kidder and its parent, General
Electric Co. Kidder is still smarting from the angry letters
and phone calls, including some from of its own brokers, that
helped spur the firm to cut back its program activity last
October.
   In Fairfield, Conn., GE declined to comment yesterday on
its Kidder unit's program activities.
   In stock-index arbitrage, traders make rapid-fire
purchases and sales of long lists of stocks with offsetting
trades in stock-index futures, profiting by slight price
discrepancies between the two markets.
   Rival traders and market analysts have been surprised by
the amount of Kidder's trading, because in recent weeks, it
has been difficult to gauge the discrepancies, or spread,
between the markets.
   Kurt Schultz, senior stock-index analyst for Refco Group
Ltd. in Chicago, said index arbitrage has "been real
sporadic, and it's been jittery, which can be a problem for
these guys. You have all these kneejerk reactions out of the
Middle East. The futures and {stocks} get out of line, but
it's tough" to do index arbitrage, "because everyone's trying
to go the same way."
   Such problems haven't stopped Kidder.
   "They are aggressive," Jeremy Lefkowitz, managing director
at Chancellor Capital Management in New York, said. "They are
executing when other people are waiting" for more obvious
opportunities.
   For example, Big Board statistics show that during the
first half-hour of trading on Aug. 3, when the stock market
plunged 57.70 points, Kidder was the most active program
trader among firms that were trading both for their own
accounts and customers -- selling 633,000 shares for its own
account and 387,000 as an agent for customers.
   Kidder had been one of several major brokerage firms that
stopped doing stock-index arbitrage for their own accounts.
But Kidder jumped back into the activity three months ago, a
few months after a similar resumption by Bear Stearns Cos.
The two biggest U.S. brokerage firms, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said
they have discontinued all index arbitrage.
   When Kidder resumed stock-index arbitrage for its own
account, the firm pledged that it would at all times -- even
before so-called circuit breakers to help slow down big
market swings are triggered -- sell stocks only on "upticks,"
when a stock is rising, and buy only on "downticks." This
approach is meant to avoid accelerating a market move already
under way.
   Many index-fund managers said the limits make it
impossible to do index arbitrage effectively.
   So how can Kidder trade with self-imposed restrictions and
still make money? People familiar with Kidder said the
in-house program trading unit, under the direction of Peter
Klein, senior vice president, is taking advantage of
sophisticated computer software it has developed over the
past few years. The computer programs are a closely guarded
secret within the firm and haven't been shown to customers.
"Peter got the mandate to develop good analytics," said an
individual familiar with the operation.
   Another system, developed for customers with the help of
GE researchers, is programmed to monitor the buying and
selling prices of "program stocks" -- those issues that are
part of stock indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index -- and how much stock is offered for sale or purchased
at a given time, or what traders call liquidity.
   It isn't surprising that Kidder has been doing so much
trading for its own account; for example, 7.1 million shares,
compared with 5.3 million for customers, in the most recent
week for which data has been released by the Big Board. The
customer-oriented part of Kidder's program trading unit has
experienced some personnel tumult. Joseph R. Schmuckler, head
of the customer unit, has left to join Nomura Securities
International, a unit of Nomura Securities Co. Steve
Bodurtha, a top analyst at Kidder who worked on trading
ideas, left to join Merrill Lynch.
