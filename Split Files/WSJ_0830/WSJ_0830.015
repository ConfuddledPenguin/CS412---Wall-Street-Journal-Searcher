   Over-the-counter stocks missed the climb in
exchange-listed shares as gloomy news in the technology
sector shadowed smaller stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.08 to 381.78, a 0.3%
loss, as volume edged up to 118.1 million from 117.8 million
Tuesday. Despite the day's loss, advancing shares edged out
decliners, 987 to 887. However, 120 stocks fell to new lows
while only 13 reached new highs.

   3Com lost nearly a third of its market value and led the
day's bad-news bearers with an unexpectedly bleak short-term
outlook. That news came just one day after Oracle Systems
skidded on nervousness about its near-term earnings outlook.
   "People were spooked by what happened with 3Com and
Oracle," said Jerry Newman, an institutional trader in San
Francisco for Cowen &amp; Co.
   At Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco, shares sold by
institutions were being bought primarily by small investors,
according to James Tarantino, head of OTC trading there.
   A number of large technology issues ended the day lower.
Intel fell 5/8 to 35; Apple Computer slid 7/8 to 37 1/4; and
Microsoft dropped 2 3/8 to 60 1/2. The Nasdaq Industrial
Index, which includes many computer stocks and larger OTC
issues, fell 1.45 to 409.26.
   Also pressuring the market was its largest utility, MCI
Communications, which fell 1 5/8 to 31 3/4. The Nasdaq
Utility Index fell 7.19 to 497.81. Financial issues fared
better as four Nasdaq financial indexes posted gains.
   Investors continued to punish the stocks of companies that
surprised them with bad news. 3Com tumbled 3 7/8 to 8 3/4 on
more than 4.8 million shares after delivering analysts a
pessimistic near-term outlook. Pharmacy Management Services
dove 3 1/8 to 7 7/8, well below its $12-a-share initial
offering price in April, after cautioning that upcoming
first-quarter earnings for fiscal 1991 will fall below
expectations.
   Investors also reacted strongly to the resignation of One
Price Clothing president Brian P. Woolf; the stock plummeted
3 5/8 to 10 1/8. And Barry's Jewelers fell 1 1/2 to 4 1/4
after reporting widening losses.
   Investors took 3Com to the woodshed after officials with
the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of computer communication
systems told analysts the declining U.S. economy is
pressuring their near-term outlook, Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report said. The stock was the day's most active as
more than 4.8 million shares changed hands.
   3Com Chief Financial Officer Christopher B. Paisley told
DJPIR the company is cautious about the short term and called
it "appropriate" for expectations to come down. However, he
called the sell-off an "overreaction" to management's
comments. He also said the company's board will consider a
share buy-back program at a Sept. 20 meeting, in addition to
an existing one-million share repurchase program.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst Therese M. Murphy
advised investors to avoid 3Com shares until revenue growth
picks up, probably not until late in the second fiscal
quarter ending November or early in the third quarter. Both
she and Salomon Brothers analyst Michele Guite also cut their
estimates for the company's 1991 first quarter and full year.
   Ms. Murphy said 3Com indicated sales of both its software
and server products have been hurt by confusion about the
latest local area network manager products by Microsoft Corp.
3Com acknowledged that "the clear beneficiary of this
confusion is Novell, which is the established market share
leader," she added.
   Pharmacy Management said it's comfortable with estimates
it will earn 50 to 77 cents a share in fiscal 1991 ending
next July, compared with an estimate of 27 cents a share for
1990 provided by First Call. However, the Tampa, Fla.,
provider of medical cost containment services and products to
workers' compensation payers and claimants said that
first-quarter earnings will fall below earlier expectations
because of expansion costs.
   One Price Clothing skidded after the departure of
president Brian Woolf. Robinson Humphrey Co. analyst Dan R.
Wewer Jr. slashed his investment opinion on the South
Carolina retailer to "sell" from "buy" and lowered his 1990
earnings estimate, noting the company indicated sales are
running below plan.
   Mr. Woolf told DJPIR his resignation was "a very amicable
leaving," and attributed his decision to differences in
management style. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry
D. Jacobs Jr., who will assume Mr. Woolf's post until a
replacement is found, also told DJPIR that recent retail
sales haven't been up to expectations, although they aren't
"alarmingly low."
   Barry's Jewelers reported that its loss for the fourth
quarter ended May 31 widened to $2.24 a share from 15 cents a
year earlier, citing increased provisions for bad debts. For
the year, the Duarte, Calif., operator of jewelry stores
reported a loss of $3.10 a share, compared with net income of
$1.21 a year earlier.
   Trans World Music skidded 2 to 20 1/4 after the Albany,
N.Y., retailer of prerecorded music and video products said
it postponed a one-million-share stock offering originally
indicated at $33 a share.
   Interphase fell 1 to 4 1/4. The Dallas maker of
microcomputer products said it will take a charge of 85 cents
a share in the third quarter ended July 31 after deciding to
discontinue its majority-owned subsidiary, OMNI Solutions
Inc. Before the charge, Interphase had net income of three
cents a share for the quarter.
   Among the day's gainers, Computer Data Systems jumped 1
3/8 to 8 5/8 after the board of the Rockville, Md., data
processor authorized a share repurchase of as many as 200,000
of its 2.8 million common shares outstanding.
   International Lease Finance gained 1 7/8 to 31 5/8 on more
than 1.2 million shares after American International Group
and International Lease Finance said they may complete their
proposed merger even if the closing price of American
International is below $66.45 a share.
   Sierra Tucson tumbled 4 to 12 1/4 before the National
Association of Securities Dealers halted trading in the stock
for pending news. After the market closed, the Tucson
operator of alcohol and drug treatment centers said it
expects a charge of 17 cents a share in 1990 because of
higher initial operating costs at its German operations. The
company now expects earnings of 14 cents a share for the
third quarter and 73 cents for the full year, compared with
year-earlier net income of 20 cents and 62 cents,
respectively.
