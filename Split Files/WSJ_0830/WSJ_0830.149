   Sick children are among the toughest cases hospitals
handle. Scared, in pain and separated from home and parents,
young patients can get worse even though medicine says they
should get better. But thanks to 50 employees of a GTE Corp.
unit in Waltham, Mass., patients at Boston's Children's
Hospital now have an antidote to sick room blues: the
computer.
   Calling their project KidBits, the GTE Laboratories
employees have given about 10,000 hours of their own time
over the past three years to teach hospitalized children how
to use personal computers. The machines, donated by GTE, are
a therapeutic diversion for many hospitalized children, who
use them to play games, and a welcome communications tool for
those few youngsters whose illnesses or injuries confine them
to sterile isolation rooms.
   KidBits volunteers mostly help out on evenings or
weekends, though their employer lets them run quarterly
workday "computer fairs" for their young charges. "The GTE
people have made an outstanding contribution to our
department and to our patients and their families," says Myra
Fox, director of the hospital's patient activity department.
"They have extended themselves in a most unique volunteer
capacity."
   KidBits was started in 1987 by George Boggs, a GTE
research psychologist, after hearing of a friend's concern
for the morale of an 11-year-old nephew who had been in a
hospital isolation room for two months following a bone
marrow transplant.
   Mr. Boggs contacted hospital administrators, volunteering
to develop a computer-communications system for the young
patients. At first, the hospital staff was skeptical, citing
possible problems of patient safety, privacy and security.
But Mr. Boggs, who believes isolation slows a child patient's
recovery, persisted and won support from Ms. Fox.
   Although Mr. Boggs since has left GTE to join another
company, KidBits continues. There is, for example, Michael
Hackney, a 32-year-old chemist working on ceramics for auto
engines, who has averaged two hours a week over the past
three years teaching computer techniques to a total of 75
children. An easy-mannered and cheerful man, Mr. Hackney
instructs the children in such things as designing
computerized get-well cards for their other friends at the
hospital.
   KidBits' first installation was a voice system which
allowed children to dial up riddles on their hospital room
phone. Later, the KidBits volunteers trained 30 hospital
therapists to use the computers so that they, in turn, could
train the sick children. The GTE-sponsored computer fairs at
the hospital draw many of the KidBits volunteers. "You really
get something back when you see these sick kids giggling as
they help Snoopy escape the Red Baron on their computer
screens," says Rebecca Hudson, an active KidBit leader.
   But the most time-consuming project of the GTE crew has
been the development of a computer system that links a
network of four germ-free rooms to an activity room. This
system provides both communication and entertainment for the
young patients, who may have to stay in the isolated room for
six to 12 weeks. The first of these systems, eventually to be
installed in 13 rooms, began operation last month.
   David Fay, a GTE Labs psychologist, spent 15 evening hours
over a recent two-week span to help wire together the first
two rooms in the new system. "It makes me feel good to do
something with my professional skills {that has} a positive
impact on someone needing help," he says.
