   Sierra Tucson Cos. said it expects a 2% decline in
third-quarter earnings because its new addiction-treatment
center in Germany won't break even this year.
   Net for the quarter ending Sept. 30 will be about
$980,000, or 14 cents a share, the company said. In the third
quarter a year ago, net was $1 million, or 20 cents a share,
on revenue of $5 million.

   Sierra Tucson said, however, that it still anticipates a
42% increase in full-year net, to $5.1 million, or 73 cents a
share. Net for 1989 was $3.6 million, or 62 cents a share, on
revenue of $18.4 million.
   The company declined to forecast its revenue for the
latest third quarter and year. It opened the treatment center
in Garmisch, West Germany, in December 1989.
