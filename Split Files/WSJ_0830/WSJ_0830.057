   REEDPOINT, Mont. -- Before Montana, there was Spain. And
in Spain, there is Pamplona. And in Pamplona each July, there
is the running of the bulls, in which the mighty animals tear
through city streets, from corral to bullring, while
thrill-seeking humans try to dodge or outrun them.
   Ernest Hemingway used Pamplona as a backdrop for "The Sun
Also Rises." As a symbol of adventure and romance, the
running of the bulls there is world-famous.

   Which brings us to Reedpoint.
   Reedpoint isn't world-famous. It is hardly even
Montana-famous. It has 96 citizens and seven businesses, and
its high school this year should have a graduating class of
one, assuming Robert Ulmer doesn't stumble along the way. It
is in the wide-open ranch country of the Yellowstone River
valley, where the access ramps to Interstates have grates to
keep the livestock off the four-lane. Reedpoint has no water
system, sewer system, mayor, police force, city government or
city taxes. The signs on the highway south of town spell its
name as one word; the signs on the railroad north of town
spell it as two.
   Nonetheless, little Reedpoint has at least one thing that
puts it squarely, if gently, in the heroic tradition. As
surely as July means Pamplona and the bulls, September means
Reedpoint. And the sheep.
   Next Sunday, thousands of people are expected to flock to
Reedpoint for what is being billed as the "101st Running of
the Sheep." (It is actually only the second running of the
sheep, but more about that later.) The festivities stretch
from morning until midnight, but the main event comes around
noon, when a thousand or so sheep will be herded the four
blocks down Reedpoint's main street, from the abandoned grain
elevators at the north to the Conoco service station at the
south, threading their way through the humanity. People can
race or pet or mingle with the sheep. The sheep, unlike the
bulls at Pamplona, don't seem to mind.
   "The sheep are so docile," says Russell Schlievert, an
organizer of the event, which is a civic fund-raiser
sponsored by a group called the Reedpoint Community Club.
"It's a very hands-on thing."
   Last year's thing started as a low-budget spoof of a
high-priced cattle drive that was the biggest event of
Montana's 1989 centennial celebration. Reedpoint ended up
attracting an estimated 12,000 people, and it raised enough
money to pay for doubling the size of the Reedpoint Memorial
Library, to two rooms from one. This year's proceeds will go
toward buying a used fire truck and emergency medical
equipment for the town.
   No one knows how big a crowd to expect this year -- or
what to expect from the crowd. Last year, many people arrived
with their favorite sheep in tow and in costume. One sheep
wore tennis shoes. Another was painted to resemble an
American flag.
   The winner of the Prettiest Ewe contest wore red-and-black
satin garters on her legs and a lacey bonnet on her head; her
owner, who led the sheep on a leash, wore a matching bonnet
and turn-of-the-century satin dress. The Ugliest Sheep
winner, by contrast, had a polka-dot look, its shaved coat
punctuated with unshorn clumps of wool, which were dyed
various colors.
   Aside from the beauty pageant, events this year range from
a parade to a street dance to a "sheep-to-shawl" contest,
which is exactly what it sounds like and is expected to take
six hours or so; the shawls will be auctioned. On the
cultural front, there are sheepherder-poetry readings.
(Sample from last year: The place I lived in wa'nt too clean/
It smelled like somethin' died/ When I talked to other
people/ They'd stay on the upwind side.)
   And there's the Smelliest Sheepherder event. Last year, it
began as a joke, with a few adequately groomed sheep men
gamely getting up on stage to the hoots of the crowd.
Suddenly, the real thing -- a herder named Festus, straight
from the hills -- pushed his way through the crowd, climbed
up on stage -- and literally overwhelmed the competition.
   "Everybody else on stage just turned around and walked
away and said, `Hey, it's his,'" says Mr. Schlievert, who
emceed the contest. "Then he got up and talked about living
on the range with the sheep." (Festus couldn't be located for
comment or for determining his last name. He's out with his
herd.)
   The idea for a sheep drive came when the Reedpoint
Community Club began looking last year for a new gimmick to
liven up its annual Labor Day weekend fund-raiser, Bachelor
Daze. That event, which included the auctioning of bachelors,
usually attracted a couple of thousand people to town, but
the idea was getting old, as were the bachelors.
   At the time, the Montana press was playing up something
called the Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive, a six-day
extravaganza in which anyone could ride along with the herd
and play cowboy at a price of not much more than, say, six
days in Paris or Rome. Reedpoint decided that it might be fun
to have something a little more down-to-earth. Sheep are
about as down-to-earth as you can get; here in cattle
country, they're treated as rather a joke. Soon, the Great
Montana Centennial Sheep Drive was born.
   The parallel with Pamplona's bulls was pointed out by a
newspaper reporter in Billings, about 60 miles east of here;
Reedpoint folks hadn't heard of Pamplona. But the small-town
promoters proved adept at big-city media manipulation.
   "We took our sheep to downtown Billings, unloaded them
right in front of the TV stations and let them eat their
flowers and stuff until they came out and interviewed us,"
says Chery Leicht, who was secretary-treasurer of the
Community Club last year.
   The word spread, and on Labor Day weekend, people
descended on Reedpoint. Vendors ran out of food by
midafternoon. Connie MacLean, the official silkscreener, ran
out of T-shirts; after selling 560 of them that day, she
later had to print up and mail another 400 to people who left
orders. The event was thoroughly homespun: One old ranch lady
set up a gas stove on a corner and made fried bread for
passers-by.
   "The Great Montana Centennial Sheep Drive must be the most
successful spoof since Orson Welles's `War of the Worlds' was
broadcast in 1938," an editorial in the Billings Gazette
declared. "Certainly it was the most fun."
   It also brought money into a town that doesn't have much
of its own. The high-school girls' basketball team made
enough from its hamburger stand to pay for new jerseys and a
trip to Billings for the district tournament. And the
Community Club netted enough -- $9,131 -- for a 20-by-22-foot
addition to the library, a former one-room schoolhouse
roughly 12-by-14 feet.
   "It was unbelievable," says Librarian Evelyn Burton, a
retired schoolteacher, whose house is next door to the
library. (People don't have library cards in Reedpoint,
because Mrs. Burton knows everyone by name.) Mrs. Burton says
that as a result of the expansion, she is considering
increasing the library's hours -- or, more precisely, hour:
It's open from 3 to 4 every Wednesday afternoon.
   Given the success of last year's event, there was no
question but that it would be revived this year. Indeed, the
only issue was what to call it. The organizers settled on the
"101st Running of the Sheep" -- even though it's only the
second -- because it's Montana's 101st birthday. "It didn't
make much sense to me," says Ms. MacLean, the silkscreener.
"But I think they just liked the sound of it."
   It sounds like a tradition, an end-of-summer celebration
that every year should give Reedpoint its moment in the sun.
It might even become a continuing boon to the town's coffers.
At least, say many residents, isn't it pretty to think so?
