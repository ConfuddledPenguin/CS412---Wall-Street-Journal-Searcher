   Semiconductor makers went into a frenzy this week when
word spread that the U.S. Patent Office had granted a
far-reaching patent covering many of the electronics
industry's most lucrative chips.
   The patent recipient, they learned, was little-known
Gilbert P. Hyatt, a 52-year-old divorced inventor living
alone in La Palma, Calif. If it survives challenges, his
patent could drain hundreds of millions of dollars from
chip-company coffers.

   The patent could also turn chip-industry history on its
ear. Mr. Hyatt applied for a patent in 1970 that covered his
invention of what he says was the world's first
microprocessor, the type of chip that now plays the role of
central commander in tens of millions of computers around the
world.
   But Ted Hoff, a former Intel Corp. engineer, is generally
considered to be the inventor of the microprocessor. Intel
commercially produced the first microprocessors in 1971. If
Mr. Hyatt is able to enforce his patent, which covers a
technology he said he invented in his living room in 1968, he
could demand royalties from big microprocessor makers such as
Intel and Motorola Inc.
   Chip companies refused to say what the impact of the
patent would be or if they planned to contest it. An Advance
Micro Devices Inc. spokesman said the company's lawyers had
just learned of the patent, which was granted July 17. A
Texas Instruments Inc. spokesman said the company had a
policy of not commenting on other people's patents.
   Intel said its lawyers are studying the scope of the
patent. "We respect valid intellectual property claims," said
an Intel spokeswoman. "There's been no notification of any
infringement on a patent."
   Chip-industry officials had one thing in common: No one
seemed to know who Mr. Hyatt was. "He's very obscure," said
Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, a closely
read newsletter. "I've never heard of him before."
   Even Mr. Hyatt's publicist, Charles McHenry, conceded he
knows little about his client. "He's very private," said Mr.
McHenry. "A classic techno-nerd: Give him the beanie and
propeller and he'd be right there."
   Mr. Hyatt said his obscurity was planned. "I've kept a low
profile because I'm a little guy who's very vulnerable to the
big companies," he said in a phone interview.
   Mr. Hyatt's story plays like many other Silicon Valley
garage-shop legends. After working for several Howard Hughes
companies and Teledyne Inc. in the early 1960s, he formed a
company called Micro Computer Inc. to develop computer
technologies. Using a bedroom in his Los Angeles ranch-style
home as an office, he set up soldering irons and other
laboratory equipment in his living room, where his wife
helped him wire together "breadboards," the prototypes that
chip makers create to test their ideas.
   There, Mr. Hyatt said, he came up with the idea of
combining various computer circuits on a single sliver of
silicon to make what is known now as a microprocessor. In
1970, after he had received venture capital and moved his
company out of his home, he began what was to be an arduous
20-year process of patenting his invention. The patent office
repeatedly rejected his applications, asking for proof that
he had solved certain thorny problems, such as how to wire
tiny transistors together on the chip.
   Since his company folded in 1971, Mr. Hyatt has funded his
private research by consulting for the aerospace industry,
helping companies develop computer systems that track
missiles, find enemy submarines and aim signals at
satellites. Still, the pending chip patent "has been a
continued financial and time drain," said Mr. Hyatt. "It's a
real relief to have it now . . . and it should help correct
historical events."
   Whether chip-industry heavyweights will concede his
version of history isn't clear, because chip companies aren't
talking. Patent lawyers familiar with the case say it's too
early to tell how Mr. Hyatt will be able to enforce his
patent. Intel and others have a track record of fighting
fiercely to protect their chip-making rights, and a
protracted court battle could ensue.
   "It's hard to know what a fundamental microprocessor
patent like this will cover," said Peter Courture, an
intellectual-property lawyer with the Palo Alto, Calif., firm
of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, who works with chip
companies. "But there's one thing I can guarantee: A lot of
companies will fight it tooth and nail."
   Wall Street didn't react strongly to the news, with
analysts saying that they hadn't figured out what impact the
patent would have. Intel and Motorola stocks closed down
slightly, while Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor
Corp. stock prices rose.
   What chip makers will probably do is search for "prior
art," evidence that work done before Mr. Hyatt's invalidates
his patent, said Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. "There
was a lot of simultaneous independent invention going on" in
the 1960s, he said. "There are many ways to attack a patent."
   Mr. Hyatt said he expects to gain royalties, but added
that "I'm not a litigious type of person." He said he is
forming a joint venture with a large U.S. company with a chip
division to take care of licensing his patent. Mr. Hyatt said
he plans to use royalties to fund inventions to add to the 50
patents he already holds on various technologies, including
computers and liquid-crystal displays.
   "The patent is a basic one, the royalty rates will be low,
and I don't think it will be a problem," Mr. Hyatt said.
   The chip industry has a history of disputes over basic
patents that could set a precedent for how Mr. Hyatt's patent
is treated. Two inventors, Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby, each
claimed for years to have invented the first integrated
circuit. The patent office eventually ruled that it was a
joint invention.
   Texas Instruments has recently cashed in on some basic
patents it has had for decades. Analysts estimate that it
collects about $100 million a year in royalties from Japanese
and Korean companies for a basic memory-chip technology. And
last December, TI was granted a patent in Japan for the basic
integrated-circuit technology, a patent that analysts say
could bring TI $150 million to $650 million a year.
   Whether Mr. Hyatt can expect royalties approaching TI's is
unclear, lawyers said. "This looks like a credible claim,"
said Willis E. Higgins, a Palo Alto chip-patent lawyer. The
Los Angeles law firm representing Mr. Hyatt is very good, he
said, but "he could end up getting out of this patent
anything from nothing to many millions of dollars."
