   BASF AG said its 1990 first-half group pretax profit
tumbled 21% to 1.74 billion marks ($1.11 billion) from 2.19
billion marks in the year-earlier period.
   The profit decline for West Germany's largest chemical
concern came on a 4.5% drop in group sales, which fell to
23.37 billion marks from 24.46 billion marks a year before.

   For the second quarter, group pretax profit plummeted 31%
to 891 million marks from 1.29 billion marks. Group sales
fell 8.1% to 11.48 billion marks from 12.49 billion marks.
   BASF said it sees difficulties for the rest of the year.
The company said that although there are "good" prospects for
boosting the volume of products sold, it expects to attain
only the "solid earnings" level of 1987, rather than the
level of 1988 or the record performance of 1989.
