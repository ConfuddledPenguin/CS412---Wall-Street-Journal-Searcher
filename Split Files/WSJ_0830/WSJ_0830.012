   STOCKHOLM -- Smarting from a third consecutive quarter of
plunging pretax profit, AB Volvo announced plans to trim
heavy truck production in the U.S. for the rest of this year
and begin hefty job cuts at both its car and truck divisions.
   The Swedish auto concern said profit before taxes skidded
56% in the second quarter, to 1 billion Swedish kronor
($174.7 million) from 2.29 billion kronor a year earlier.
Pretax profit was down 54% for the first six months, to 2.06
billion kronor from 4.48 billion kronor the previous year.

   "It's quite clear that market conditions this year are
tougher than we expected. Downturns in some of our larger
markets -- the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia -- have hit us
pretty hard," said Christer Zetterberg, Volvo's chief
operating officer.
   Mr. Zetterberg admitted the company "doesn't expect to get
much help from markets during the rest of this year or 1991."
Consequently, Volvo management has ordered tough cost-cutting
steps "which are necessary to restore our Swedish
competitiveness," he said.
   Investors seemed to welcome the move. Volvo B-free shares,
the series most traded internationally, jumped 10 kronor to
close at 325 kronor in trading yesterday on the Stockholm
Stock Exchange.
   Volvo intends to eliminate 5,000 jobs by the end of next
year, with about 80% of the layoffs affecting car plants in
Sweden.
   But overseas units also are beginning to feel the pinch.
Volvo GM heavy Truck Corp. -- the three-year-old alliance
with General Motors Corp. -- is about to lay off 350
employees, about 8.5% of its total payroll, and reduce 1990
production by 2,000 trucks or about 10%.
   Sagging heavy truck demand this year has taken its toll.
Volvo said unit sales of its heavy trucks in the U.S.
declined 22% during the first six months. The total U.S.
market fell 18% during the same period.
   Volvo's sales dropped 2.4% in the second quarter to 22.92
billion kronor from 23.48 billion kronor the previous year.
First half sales shrank 4.2% to 44.59 billion kronor from
46.55 billion kronor a year earlier, the company said.
