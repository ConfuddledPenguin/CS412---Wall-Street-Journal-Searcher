   The board of Northeast Bancorp Inc., holding company of
Union Trust Co., adopted a poison-pill measure designed to
make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   The move comes two weeks after the Federal Reserve Board
turned down a proposed acquisition of Northeast by Bank of
New York Co. The Fed said the acquisition would have hurt the
New York bank's ability to maintain a strong capital
position.

   On Sept. 11, Northeast will distribute rights to purchase
common stock to holders of record Sept. 10. Under certain
circumstances, the rights would entitle the holders to
acquire shares of Northeast Bancorp or its acquirer at half
price.
   Northeast Bancorp, which had about 7.3 million shares
outstanding at June 30, said the plan isn't a response to any
effort to take control of the Stamford, Conn., banking
company.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Northeast
shares fell $1.125 to $12.125.
