   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- Commercial Intertech Corp. said
directors authorized repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of
common stock in the open market or through privately
negotiated transactions.
   The producer of hydraulic parts, fluid purification
products and metal products last month completed repurchase
of a previously authorized 2.5 million shares.

   "The current depressed market price of Commercial's shares
represents an undervaluation," said Paul Powers, chairman,
president and chief executive officer. The stock closed
yesterday at $14.75, about half the 52-week high of $28.625 a
share. There are about 9.9 million shares outstanding.
