   WASHINGTON -- Ponce Federal Bank, one of the largest
thrifts in Puerto Rico, was hit with strong enforcement
measures by the Office of Thrift Supervision -- including an
order to change the locks on its doors.
   The measures, designed to "increase the bank's safety and
soundness," according to the OTS, include a temporary
cease-and-desist order issued against Ramiro L. Colon, former
chairman, president and chief executive officer and now a
stockholder, and his brother, Wendell W. Colon, former thrift
counsel and also a stockholder.

   According to the OTS, the Colons have been ordered to stop
causing the bank to violate federal regulations against loans
to affiliated parties and insider transactions, and to post a
$50,000 bond to make funds available for restitution to the
thrift.
   The OTS order also calls for members of the thrift's board
and Ramiro Colon to pay $615,000 in restitution to Ponce
Federal.
   Ponce Federal itself has been directed, among other
measures, to comply with OTS regulations dealing with loans
to affiliated parties and insider transactions; to stop any
direct employment-related payments to Ramiro Colon; and to
deny the Colons access to any of the institution's records or
files. Federal regulators also ordered the thrift to change
its locks and deny keys to the Colons.
   Regulators noted that the measures don't affect the
thrift's daily operations or depositors' accounts, which
continue to be insured up to $100,000.
   Thrift officials and Messrs. Colon weren't available for
comment.
