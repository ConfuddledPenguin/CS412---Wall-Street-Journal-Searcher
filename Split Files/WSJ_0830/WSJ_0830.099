   TEL AVIV -- If there is no certainty that economic and
diplomatic sanctions will dispose of Saddam Hussein, the same
is true of a massive air strike. I was a member of a
government that decided on a very successful air strike
against Nasser in 1967, but he remained in office and his
armaments were replenished within six months.
   The Gulf situation today has no quick fix. If the U.S. is
not prepared for phased action and perseverance in pursuit of
its declared aim, it cannot hope for success. The anti-Saddam
coalition will be more likely to endorse armed action if it
is proposed after exploring the slender prospect of success
by watertight quarantine. And if armed force is to be
effective either as a deterrent or as a means of ultimate
sanction, it must be, and appear to be, invincible. Thus both
the advocates of military action and those who believe,
however skeptically, that blockades and interdiction will
suffice have an objective interest in a patient attitude to
time.

   Meanwhile, the foreign media have done Israel no service
in portraying it wrongly as a source of agitation for
impatient courses. Conspicuous unobtrusiveness is not a
familiar Israeli posture, but in this case it has its own
logic. The task of resisting major international aggressions
must be carried on shoulders broader than ours. Israel's role
consists in an increase of vigilance, a serene and
unprovocative projection of its strength -- and clarity in
defining the points at which its vital interests would be
engaged. All this has been well accomplished in a mood of
bipartisan understanding between the major elements in the
Israeli parliamentary system. If there have been occasional
strident departures by individuals from those limits, this
only proves that lunatic fringes are universal.
   The fact that Iraq is not contiguous to Israel is of great
importance. It means that Saddam could engage us directly
only by inaugurating a missile exchange that would expose him
to untold devastation. The other theoretical option would be
available only if he were to obtain a base for action in
Jordan. This would mean multiplying his adversaries, of which
he seems to have more than enough already, and he cannot
realistically believe that he would be able to avoid
encountering Israel far away from his own ground and from
ours.
   The paradox of Jordan is that its integrity is safeguarded
by Israel's deterrent power, not by an illusory alliance with
Baghdad. King Hussein should look westward across the narrow
river for his kingdom's safety, not eastward toward the Gulf.
His anxiety about the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
would be more understandable if it were less self-righteous.
He is the architect of that problem through his decision to
fight Israel in 1967 and should therefore take a role in its
solution.
   Geopolitical realities are stronger than passions, and
these realities tell us inexorably that Jordanian and
Palestinian destinies have an Israeli context and are by
their very nature remote from the tumult of the Gulf.
Jordanians and Palestinians will have to rediscover the
Israeli dialogue, for they have nowhere else to look.
   The Gulf crisis is not Israel's only or main problem. It
does not weaken our national structure, our democratic
principles, our Jewish vocation, our national unity, our
economy, our society, our regional peace or our international
relations. All these are weakened by the burden of enforcing
our jurisdiction over a Palestinian population half the size
of our own, without being able to offer them civic equality
or any expression of their national identity.
   Israel is one of the 160 countries whose parliaments or
governments have never committed themselves to recognizing
the permanent legitimacy of this situation. It is therefore
encouraging to note that the suspended peace process may be
discussed next week between the U.S. and the Israeli foreign
ministers. It is tendentious to assert that peace between
Israel and the Arab states is more urgent than progress in
Israel-Palestinian relations. These two issues are
inseparable. Does anyone know the name of an Arab state that
has either the will or the capacity to discuss peace with
Israel without placing the boundary question and the status
and identity of the 1.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza at the head of the agenda?
   Secretary of State James Baker's proposal for a Cairo
dialogue with Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian participation
was the most innocuous, safest and least hazardous proposal
ever submitted to Israel by a foreign power. It had majority
support in Israel. It could lead in time to a community
structure in which Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians
could maintain separate juridical and cultural identities
while closely integrating in all other domains. What Europe
can best offer Israel and its neighbors is the example of its
own community structure, which evolved after wars more
frequent and lethal than all the conflicts of the Middle
East.
   Saddam's squalid maneuvers must not only be resisted by
international condemnation. They must also be discredited by
competing models of national freedom, social harmony and
institutionalized regional cooperation. Only thus can Middle
Eastern nations emerge from deadlock into the movement and
impulse of the modern age.
