   SEYMOUR, Ind. -- Home Federal Savings Bank said it will
ask shareholders at the annual meeting, scheduled for Oct.
30, to approve the formation of a holding company, to be
named Home Federal Bancorp.
   The company said a holding-company structure would provide
it with "greater operating flexibility, as well as increased
ability to take advantage of possible future acquisition
opportunities."
