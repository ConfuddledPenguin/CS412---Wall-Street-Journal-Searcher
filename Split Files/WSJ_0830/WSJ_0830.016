   "The Forgotten Ally" (editorial, Aug. 10) is off the mark.
Turkey is scarcely forgotten -- it is the third-highest
recipient of U.S. military aid. In addition, over the past
decade it has received loans and other economic support from
Europe. It has also received up to a billion dollars a year
in support and aid from the Soviet Union and its erstwhile
satellites -- the only NATO country to do so.
   The congressional limits to U.S. aid to Turkey resulted
from its invasion of Cyprus and continuing threats against
another NATO member, Greece. It is also worth recalling the
more complete Turkish record on human rights and on the
treatment of ethnic minorities. It is uneven at best. While
it is true that it has harbored Kurds fleeing gruesome
conditions in Iraq and Iran, their brethren have been
subjected to humiliations and torture in Turkey. Amnesty
International and similar organizations have been documenting
these human-rights violations for years.

   Other ethnic minorities no longer present problems because
they have been persecuted out of existence. Pogroms in 1955
and later reduced the historic Greek Christian community in
Istanbul and the islands of Imbros and Tenedos from 250,000
people to fewer than 4,000 today.
   The problem of Western perceptions of Turkey derives from
that country's record. Even the more-enlightened Turkish
leaders -- for example, President Turgut Ozalhave never faced
up to these horrors. Turkey's unwillingness or inability to
face up to the barbaric moments in its recent past is the
main reason why European peoples and governments "look down
their noses."

   Your editorial on Turkey deserves a Pulitzer Prize for
distortion for portraying Turkey as the champion of the West,
a model of democracy and a haven for the ethnically
oppressed. You trivialize Turkey's past and recent record
regarding the mistreatment of minorities (Armenians, Kurds),
the occupation of Cyprus and the lack of true democratic
pluralism.
   Furthermore, you fail to acknowledge that Turkey's
cautious assistance in the current Middle East crisis is a
result of political and economic considerations, including
promises of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance, rather
than of Turkish kinship with the West. Indeed, any Western
bias toward Turkey is due not to religion but rather to
Turkey's lack of respect for human rights and its 16-year
military occupation of Cyprus. Turkey is, of course, a
strategic friend and ally of the U.S.; as such, it would be
served best by our helping it overcome its shortcomings
instead of sweeping them under an Anatolian carpet.

   Turkey has grossly violated human rights in Cyprus since
it invaded the island in 1974, occupying 37% of its territory
and forcibly uprooting some 200,000 Greek-Cypriots. Turkey
consistently ignores numerous resolutions that call for the
immediate withdrawal of its occupation troops.
   Indeed it could be argued that Iraq took the consistent
refusal of Turkey to abide by the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus
as a precedent to invade Kuwait.

   Your editorial referred to Turkey as "secular." In terms
of being a "secular" state, Christian churches in Turkey are
prohibited from ringing their church bells -- except perhaps
once on Sunday. Christian clergymen are prohibited from
wearing clerical outfits in public. The Christian religion in
Turkey is terribly oppressed -- but I don't think the term
"secular" is the right word for this situation. In these
terms, the modern world's ultimate "secular" leader would be
Stalin.
   You also refer to Turkey as "democratic." In Turkey,
torture of political prisoners is so widespread that Amnesty
International does not list individual names, but only round
numbers, of the 250,000 Turkish political prisoners tortured
in recent years.
   Like our previous aid to Iraq, aid to Turkey could prove
to be a very smart short-term strategy -- and a very stupid
long-term strategy.
