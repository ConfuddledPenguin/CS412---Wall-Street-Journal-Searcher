   Recently you noted (editorial, Aug. 2) that Meryl Streep
is analyzing Hollywood's employment practices. Projecting
from a study showing "men had twice as many roles as women in
1989's movies, Ms. Streep says that . . . `by the year 2000,
we will have 13% of roles . . . and in 20 years, we will be
eliminated from the movies.'" But will the trend stop there?
   Golly, this is even worse than she imagined, because when
the trend is projected for an additional 10 years, men will
be playing women] And yes, there is irrefutable evidence to
support this: 10 years ago, one man, Dustin Hoffman, played
one woman in "Tootsie." Today, two men, Eric Idle and Robbie
Coltrane, play two women in "Nuns on the Run." The trend is
obvious.

   Apparently, Ms. Streep has seen the future and it isn't
her.
