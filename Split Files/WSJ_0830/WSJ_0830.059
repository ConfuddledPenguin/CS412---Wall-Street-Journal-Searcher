   STANLEY WORKS directors boosted the quarterly dividend 11%
and authorized the tool maker to buy back as many as three
million, or 7.1%, of its shares outstanding. The board
declared a dividend of 30 cents a share, up from 27 cents,
payable Sept. 29 to stock of record Sept. 10. Richard H.
Ayers, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
dividend action reflects the New Britain, Conn., company's
confidence in its prospects. The board authorized the
buy-back because it considers Stanley Works shares
undervalued, he added. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Stanley Works shares rose 75 cents to
$30.375.
