   On Nov. 28, 1987, a 15-year-old black girl, whose
stepfather had stabbed his first wife 14 times in 1969 as a
dress rehearsal for killing her with four bullet holes to the
head in 1970, was seen crawling into a plastic garbage bag
outside the Pavillion Condominiums near Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
The girl's clothing had been singed by fire, she was covered
in dog excrement, and the words "KKK" and "nigger" had been
scrawled onto her body. It was not the sort of thing that
happened in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., every day.
   It is the premise of "Outrage: The Story Behind the Tawana
Brawley Hoax" (Bantam, 408 pages, $21.95) that Tawana Brawley
was so fearful of returning to her stepfather's house, from
which she had been absent four days, that she and her mother,
Glenda, cooked up an elaborate story about rape and abduction
at the hands of white policemen and Ku Klux Klan members to
prevent Ralph King from punishing her for visiting a
boyfriend serving time in a nearby prison. As a result of
this hoax, various innocent people had their reputations
besmirched, well-meaning celebrities such as Bill Cosby and
Mike Tyson were duped, and the black people of America,
already victimized by poverty, crime and an enduring racism,
were sucker-punched by a clan of ne'er-do-well pranksters and
their publicity-mongering advisers. All the same, it's worth
remembering that 15-year-old girls often will dream up wild
tales, particularly if they happen to have a stepfather who
stabbed his first wife 14 times before dropping by a year
later to polish her off for good.

   "Outrage" is the work of six New York Times reporters
(Robert D. McFadden, Ralph Blumenthal, M.A. Farber, E.R.
Shipp, Charles Strum and Craig Wolff), some of whom covered
the case, some of whom rewrote the stories filed by those who
covered the case. It is, as one would expect of a Times
undertaking, very well-researched and very well-written, and
it is, as one would expect of a Times undertaking, more than
vaguely self-congratulatory. The Times reporters chide their
downscale upstate journalistic colleagues for their lack of
zeal in pursuing the story, and also take potshots at their
less gifted competitors in the broadcast news community.
Piling on the inside baseball about the workings of a
big-city newspaper, the sextet recount how they, the pros
from the Big Apple, busted this story wide open, leaving no
doubt that Tawana and Glenda Brawley had cooked up this
farcical tale, which was then played for all it was worth by
the Brooklyn-based James Brown impersonator and erstwhile FBI
informant the Rev. Al Sharpton and two lawyers, the
politically ambitious C. Vernon Mason and the implacable
Alton Maddox.
   The self-congratulatory tone is more than a trifle
grating, as the Times reporters were privy to all sorts of
hot tips and official leaks to which journeymen at papers
such as the Poughkeepsie Journal were not. But, more to the
point, the Times reporters hardly were cracking the crime of
the century. From very early on, it was clear that something
smelled about this story, and it wasn't just dog feces. Ms.
Brawley claimed to have been forcibly abducted and held
captive for four days, but there was never any evidence of
physical harm. She claimed to have been sexually violated but
there never was any evidence of rape. An abundance of
medical, psychological and circumstantial evidence gradually
made it clear that Ms. Brawley, whatever her reasons, was
lying. Long before the New York Times had laid the case to
rest, an awful lot of its readers already had the general
idea.
   Not that everyone thinks the case has been laid to rest.
What is most disturbing about Ms. Brawley's ludicrous yarn is
that it was believed, and continues to be believed, by more
than a tiny number of black Americans. Why? Why not? As the
authors of "Outrage" point out, black New Yorkers had grown
weary of official investigations that inevitably sided with
white police officers compelled to strangle unusually
athletic graffiti artists or gun down knife-wielding
grandmas. The mood of credulity was further abetted by the
notorious Howard Beach case, in which a terrified young black
man was hounded to his death on a Brooklyn highway late in
1986.
   "Outrage" does an admirable, evenhanded job with all this,
even explaining the motivation for Mr. Maddox's all-consuming
hatred of whites (he was savagely beaten by a white gang
while growing up in Georgia). But the book hardly is
sympathetic toward this pack of manipulative liars. Mr.
Maddox, who accused New York State Attorney General Robert
Abrams of masturbating while looking at Tawana Brawley's
photograph, comes off as a racist madman. Glenda Brawley
comes off as a media-teasing charlatan. Mr. Sharpton, who
even accused the Mafia and the Irish Republican Army of
participating in Ms. Brawley's degradation, comes off as an
amiable stooge. Ralph King comes off as a stepfather no girl
would want to mess with. Tawana comes off as Tawana.
   The authors have an eye for the telling detail: Glenda
Brawley doing her aerobics exercises on the roof of a Queens
church where she was hiding out from the government;
then-heavyweight champion Mike Tyson giving Tawana his
$36,000 Rolex watch; Gov. Mario Cuomo phoning a black radio
station in New York and confronting his adversaries on the
air. Yet the most memorable image is that of Tawana Brawley
and her entourage turning up in Atlanta to lay a wreath at
Martin Luther King's final resting place. Until then, Ms.
Brawley merely had been guilty of lying. Now she was guilty
of defiling a grave.
