   FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. -- National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc.
said the company's board approved the conversion of its
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to a Chapter 7 liquidation of
assets.
   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors in April, said its financial condition has
deteriorated and its main secured lender stopped funding its
operations.
