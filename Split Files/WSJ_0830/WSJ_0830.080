   WASHINGTON -- Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, in a
move to prop up sagging wheat prices, ordered the refilling
of a special wheat reserve for providing emergency food aid
to developing countries.
   The move was seen here and in the commodity markets as an
attempt to partly compensate U.S. farmers for the loss of
wheat sales to Iraq, which had been a major buyer of U.S.
commodities before the Persian Gulf crisis.

   Currently, the so-called food-security reserve contains 60
million bushels of wheat, as compared with its statutory
maximum of 147 million bushels. "It is prudent to replenish
the reserve with higher wheat stocks due to a bumper {U.S.}
wheat harvest," Mr. Yeutter said yesterday.
   The Agriculture Department hasn't yet decided how much
government-owned wheat to put into the reserve Sept. 28. It
depends on how much uncommitted wheat is on hand. The
Agriculture Department also sets aside surplus wheat for
domestic distribution and the overseas Food-for-Peace
program.
   "There is a reasonably good chance that we would have
enough uncommitted wheat to fill it," Mr. Yeutter said.
   He and other Bush administration officials have been under
political pressure from wheat-state lawmakers to take steps
to boost wheat prices that have been depressed by the
prospect of bumper wheat crops throughout the Northern
Hemisphere, including the Soviet Union, and a record world
harvest of 584 million tons.
   "It's a positive step," said Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.).
"It's the first sign of recognition on their part that they
need to put a floor under this {wheat} price, and for
humanitarian reasons, they need to put more wheat in the
reserve as well."
   In trading at the Kansas City Board of Trade yesterday,
the wheat contract for September delivery fell five cents a
bushel to settle at $2.72. Similarly, wheat took a four-cent
drop on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Mr. Yeutter acknowledged that the refilling of the
reserve, which had been drawn down during the drought years
of 1988 and 1989, will be "more symbolic than substantial"
for the markets, but it should still be "a plus."
   He said that the department "has to do other things" to
find customers for U.S. wheat and shore up wheat prices. The
department is willing to subsidize the sale of 11.3 million
tons of wheat this year to 40 countries under the Export
Enhancement Program, but so far "we just haven't had many
takers," Mr. Yeutter said. "Potential buyers are waiting for
the market to fall further."
   The administration is trying to counteract what he calls
the French government's "incredibly aggressive attempt to buy
market share" by selling wheat at $92 to $94 a metric ton
with subsidies ranging as high as $120 a ton.
