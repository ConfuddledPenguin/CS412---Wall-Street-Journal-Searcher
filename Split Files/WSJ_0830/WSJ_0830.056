   U.S. Shoe Corp. reported a 29% drop in profit for its
second quarter ended Aug. 4 because of a slowdown in sales at
its Lens-Crafters Optical stores, previously the specialty
retailer's fastest growing unit.
   The Cincinnati-based company, which last month predicted a
second-quarter earnings drop, said the sales slump in
eyeglasses continues in August, but that management believes
it is a temporary reaction to economic uncertainty rather
than a long-term trend.

   Nonetheless, the company said increased concern about a
general softness in the economy makes management "cautious"
about prospects for the remainder of the year.
   U.S. Shoe's second-quarter net fell to $1.9 million, or
four cents a share, from $2.6 million, or six cents a share,
a year earlier. Sales rose 15% to $671.4 million, from $583.2
million.
   For the first half, net was $19.3 million, or 43 cents a
share, more than double the $7.8 million, or 17 cents a
share, a year ago. Sales climbed 16% to $1.34 billion, from
$1.15 billion.
   Jeffrey S. Stein, retail analyst with McDonald &amp; Co.,
Cleveland, said there were no major surprises in the report.
However, he lowered his earnings estimate for the Jan. 31
fiscal year to $1.60 a share, from $1.75. He now expects
Lens-Crafters to have a second-half earnings decline, and he
has become more concerned about a general softening in retail
sales. Last fiscal year U.S. Shoe earned $49.2 million, or
$1.10 a share, on sales of $2.56 billion.
   Second-quarter operating profit at Lens-Crafters plunged
55% to $5 million, from $11 million a year earlier. While
sales rose 13% to $145.6 million, a larger number of stores
accounted for all of the gain. At the end of the quarter
Lens-Crafters operated 388 stores, up from 305 stores a year
earlier.
   The company said sales in the optical industry softened
suddenly in late April, holding second-quarter
sales-per-store about even with a year earlier after a period
of rapid sales gains. The company said it was difficult to
quickly adjust store-level expenses for the
lower-than-expected sales volume, but that Lens-Crafters did
make the adjustment late in the quarter. Comparable store
sales in August are "modestly below" second-quarter levels,
U.S. Shoe said.
   Women's apparel retailing produced a $531,000 operating
profit in contrast to an operating loss of $174,000 a year
earlier. Sales rose 17% to $313.3 million. Comparable store
sales gains have continued at double-digit levels in August,
and early reaction to the group's fall merchandise is
positive, the company said.
   The footwear group had a 47% rise in second-quarter
operating profit to $7.9 million, on a 14% rise in sales to
$212.6 million. Its second-half earnings outlook is
encouraging, U.S. Shoe said.
   Separately, U.S. Shoe said it will open several
Lens-Crafters stores in the United Kingdom during the fourth
quarter, its first outside the U.S. and Canada. U.S. Shoe
said it may open as many as 100 Lens-Crafter stores in the
U.K. within the next five to seven years. The U.K is a
logical entry point for the $6 billion Western European
optical market, the company said.
