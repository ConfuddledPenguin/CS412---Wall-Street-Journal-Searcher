   ORANGE, Calif. -- West Coast Bancorp said its
third-quarter results will include a $1.4 million loan
write-off that is expected to reduce net income by $850,000,
or nine cents a share.
   West Coast Bancorp said the increase in provision for
possible credit losses stems from its inactive nonbanking
subsidiary, West Coast Realty Finance. The loan is secured by
a second deed of trust on a 60,000-square-foot office
building.

the year despite the write-off.
