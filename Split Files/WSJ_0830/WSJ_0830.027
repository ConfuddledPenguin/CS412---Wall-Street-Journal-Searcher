   NEW YORK -- At the big U.S. stock and futures exchanges,
program traders have been "collared" and detoured into
"sidecars" in an effort to get them to "stabilize." To all
this, many program-trading investors are saying "goodbye."
   New exchange limits on stock-index arbitrage, the most
controversial form of program trading, have made the strategy
riskier and harder to execute when markets are moving sharply
higher or lower. So Wall Street's program traders are simply
doing more and more arbitrage-related trades off exchanges.

   Program trading, the simultaneous buying or selling of
hundreds of stocks, still averages about 10% of average daily
New York Stock Exchange volume. That reflects the need of
some big investors to trade large baskets of stocks in
strategies not related to index arbitrage. Also, many big
brokers such as Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. have stepped up index
arbitrage trading for the house account, making up for volume
that may have been lost from money managers.
   Advocates of program trading curbs say they help calm
panicky markets. At the same time, however, exchange
officials want the majority of trades to stay on exchanges
because, they say, it results in better pricing for all
investors.
   Program trading curbs indeed slow the abrupt advances and
declines in stock prices that this strategy, unhindered, can
exacerbate -- as demonstrated on several occasions this
month. But the volatility is reduced at the cost of market
efficiency, which means investors being able to buy or sell
easily at the best price.
   Under Rule 80A, the New York Stock Exchange mandates that
stock-index arbitrage, in which computer-assisted traders
rapidly buy or sell stocks in New York with offsetting trades
in stock futures in Chicago, must be conducted in a
technically stabilizing way once the Dow Jones Industrial
Average swings 50 points up or down from the previous day's
close. This "collar" introduces enough risk into the standard
stock-index arbitrage trade that use of the strategy almost
dries up, traders say.
   At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index futures, commonly used in stock-index
arbitrage, aren't allowed to fall more than 12 points for a
half-hour. Such a move also kicks in the Big Board's
"sidecar" procedure that routes all program trading orders to
a holding file. This "coordinated circuit breaker" tends to
block most stock-index arbitrage activity, traders say.
   Since last October's stock market "minicrash," program
traders have faced negative public opinion. The outcry was so
great that the Big Board commissioned a special panel on
volatility and investor confidence to deal with the question.
   But since last October, brokers and the big index funds
have been expecting tighter regulation. To duck the heat of
critics and sidestep regulatory blockades, they are trading
away from formal exchanges and even electronic networks, in a
completely private market run by big brokers and banks.
   "There is no question that you see a proliferation of
arbitrage-like trades in a private market because of a lack
of liquidity on exchanges imposed by program trading
collars," says Loyd Johnson, vice president at Advanced
Investment Management, a Pittsburgh investment firm.
   "Last Thursday, we had no buyers at all in the S&amp;P futures
and that was the result of the collars," he adds. (On
Thursday, program trading restrictions took effect at the Big
Board at 9:54 a.m. EDT and remained in effect all day.)
   "Ordinarily, brokerage firms {conducting arbitrage} would
be buying futures and selling stocks," Mr. Johnson says. "But
now nobody in their right mind would take that kind of risk.
Why fool around with this liquidity problem in the listed
market when I can lock a trade up" in the over-the-counter
market? he asks.
   It's difficult to measure the volume of off-exchange stock
index-related trades because regulators are having trouble
monitoring the transactions. "I do not believe that we have a
ready source who would tell us what the aggregate level of
equity-related swaps are," says Brandon Becker, associate
director of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   But investors who use these strategies say the trades have
ballooned since last October. Big brokers and banks such as
Salomon Brothers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co.
are aggressively marketing the trades, fund managers say.
Investment firms say the corporations they manage money for
are even getting visits from brokers eager to sell new
private market techniques.
   Officials from Salomon Brothers, Bankers Trust Co. and
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. declined to comment formally.
   The rise in off-exchange stock-index trading strategies is
a textbook example of how Wall Street easily innovates around
restrictions. Also, it shows how "enhanced" stock index
funds, which promise to deliver better returns than the
market, must adopt new strategies to meet more competitive
performance demands. "There is a tremendous demand for
customized derivative products," says one Bankers Trust
official.
   Typically, the off-exchange transactions involve hundreds
of millions of dollars in stock positions, with some
involving $1 billion or more. The term of the swap agreements
can last several months or years.
   Index fund managers say the trades have lower commissions,
none of the risk involved in juggling futures and stock
positions, and much cheaper administrative costs. All these
savings help boost returns.
   "The over-the-counter market is wonderful because you can
define a strategy any way you want," says J. Thomas Allen,
president of Advanced Investment Management.
   One simple and popular strategy is swapping the return on
S&amp;P 500 over a specified time period for an interest rate
return, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, for
example.
   The index fund can speculate by buying a security, such as
commercial paper or even a junk bond, that delivers a higher
return than Libor; so at the end of the year, the fund shows
clients that it earned the S&amp;P return plus added returns from
its interest rate bet.
   Brokers can speculate by deciding to hedge or not to hedge
the commitment the firm made to deliver the S&amp;P's return.
   These transactions are simple swaps with both sides
betting that they can do better than the commitment they've
promised to deliver.
   Often, the swaps give brokers a desired "short" position
in stocks that offsets their day-to-day purchases of stocks
from customers.
   The swaps are also being conducted using foreign
stock-market indexes, such as the DAX index of major West
German stocks. Some of these markets don't have related
futures contracts, so the brokers are, in effect, creating
them with swap agreements.
   As the transactions proliferate and become more
innovative, some investors are starting to voice concerns
about credit risk. "There is a whole chain link: Does the
broker fail on his end, or does the investment manager fail
on his promise?" says Jeffrey Geller, managing director at
BEA Associates. Ordinarily, investors and brokers put up with
credit risk for a day or two as trades settle. But swap
transactions are often long-term bets, making credit-quality
concerns all the more intense.
   "Credit risk is the biggest factor," says Al Slosky, chief
investment officer of MTH Asset Management. "It's market
changes that create defaults. What if you entered into a
three-year swap agreement with Drexel Burnham Lambert two
years ago?"
