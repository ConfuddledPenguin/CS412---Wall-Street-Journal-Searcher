   HARTSVILLE, Tenn. -- McDonald's Corp. is testing a 1950's
style diner concept in this archetypical small-town U.S.A.
   Called the Golden Arch Cafe, the one-of-a-kind restaurant
features such traditional fare as pork cutlets, mashed
potatoes and cole slaw. There's also waitress service, a free
jukebox, movie posters on the walls and a nickel Coke
machine.

   McDonald's intentions for its version of the diner -- a
restaurant format enjoying something of a renaissance --
aren't clear. The company opened the Golden Arch Cafe with
only local fanfare in this town of 2,674 some 50 miles from
downtown Nashville.
   While McDonald's has experimented in recent months with
pizza, fried chicken and spaghetti in an effort to bolster
dinnerhour sales, this time the world's biggest fast-food
concern is trying out an entirely new type of restaurant.
   Same-store sales at McDonald's restaurants have slumped in
the past year, yet analysts were surprised at the company's
latest move. "While it makes some sense, I would question
whether this {concept} is something you could really build a
business around," said Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. Although he said such
restaurants are attractive to an aging population, "you have
to wonder whether nostalgia is a fad or not."
   The company chose Hartsville for its prototype, an
official told the local newspaper, because it wanted a town
of 2,500 to 3,000 people with no other traffic generator.
   Early reviews from patrons of the Golden Arch are mixed.
They're delighted that the fast-food giant chose Hartsville
for its test -- but some residents say they don't
particularly like the hamburgers it serves.
   "The worst comments I've heard are about the hamburgers,"
says Kathy Atwood-Gammons, editor of the local newspaper, the
Hartsville Vidette. "Everybody thought they'd be like
McDonald's, but they're not."
   But the cafe's French fries fare better. They're exactly
like the ones available at the nearest McDonald's -- 19 miles
away, says Rosemary Denham, the newspaper's office manager.
   The Golden Arch opens at 5:30 a.m. and normally closes
about 9 p.m. but plans to stay open late Friday nights to
accommodate post-football game fans. It also will operate
Sundays, when most other restaurants in town are closed. The
cafe also has drive-thru window service, perhaps to compete
with the local Sonic hamburger-chain outlet.
   Reminiscent of the real thing, the McDiner's menu includes
hearty country breakfasts, sandwiches and Salisbury steak
platters with a vegetable-of-the-day at $2.99 for lunch, and,
after 4 p.m., catfish dinners. Local residents say ribeye and
sirloin strip steaks also are planned. Desserts include
banana splits, sundaes and pie a la modes.
   Patrons must order at a counter, but are served the food
by waitresses, who bring it on china instead of paper plates.
   "This is real exciting to us," says Ms. Atwood-Gammons.
Since a nuclear plant project was scrapped here more than a
decade ago, Hartsville business people have been trying to
recruit new employers. "We've had our economic problems," the
editor says.
   Apropos of small-town hospitality, other local merchants
sent bouquets of flowers when the Golden Arch opened Aug. 20.
