   Banco Espanol de Credito confirmed it is postponing a
share offering in its industrial holding group, Industrial &amp;
Financiera de Banesto S.A.
   A spokesman said the delay was decided in the light of
adverse stock market conditions. Since the start of August,
international market turmoil has taken about 100 billion
pesetas ($1.04 billion) off the holding company's market
value.

   Banesto wanted to raise between 85 billion and 95 billion
pesetas from the sale of 25.4% to 26.3% of the holding
company, of which it owns 76.4%. Under current conditions, a
bank official said, such a target wouldn't be realistic.
Instead, he said, the bank intends to go ahead with technical
planning so that the offering can proceed as soon as market
conditions improve.
   The Banesto holding company owns stakes in such
corporations as oil refiner Petroleos del Mediterraneo S.A.,
metals producer Asturiana de Zinc S.A. and steelmaker
Acerinox S.A., whose shares have fallen steeply in recent
weeks.
