   As part of their strategy to confront Saddam Hussein, the
Saudis have committed themselves to boost their oil
production to make up, at least partially, for the losses
resulting from the international boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
oil. Before it did so, Saudi Arabia felt that it needed the
approval of OPEC.
   Although it obtained that approval yesterday, this need to
seek foreign approval for acting in the Saudi national
interest at a moment when Saudi Arabia is facing what might
be the greatest challenge in its modern history, should make
it clear that OPEC, from a Saudi perspective, has outlived
its usefulness -- if it was ever useful to Saudi Arabia at
all. To protect its vital interests, which happen to coincide
with those of the world at large (including the developing as
well the industrialized countries), Saudi Arabia should leave
OPEC.

   Multinational oil companies once enjoyed great discretion
to decide where oil was produced and in what quantities. The
fact that many oil producing regions were under colonial rule
greatly enhanced oil company power. OPEC was created in 1960
by Venezuela, Iraq and Saudi Arabia as a counterweight to the
power of the multinational oil companies. The founders of
OPEC hoped to enhance their bargaining position by
negotiating with the companies jointly.
   These hopes were disappointed, despite the powers that the
mass media and sanctimonious politicians have attributed to
OPEC. It is probably correct to say that the emergence of
OPEC restrained the oil companies somewhat and impelled them
to pay more attention to the interests of their host
countries. But the crucial events in the subsequent history
of oil had very little to do with OPEC.
   Specifically, the success of the producing countries in
increasing oil prices and wresting control over production
levels from the oil companies were effected essentially
independently of OPEC. The rise of oil prices prior to the
Arab oil embargo in 1973 was the result of favorable market
conditions and the quirky nature of Libyan politics.
   When Col. Gadhafi seized power in Libya in 1969, he took
advantage of tight oil supplies of the "sweet" -- low sulfur
-- oil that Libya produces to play one oil company against
the other. Rises in Libyan oil prices naturally led the other
countries to demand equal treatment. OPEC made little
difference.
   OPEC was even less relevant to the truly revolutionary
developments in the fall of 1973 when the producing
countries, once and for all, gained control over production
levels and prices from the oil companies. It was the Arab oil
embargo that achieved these results. OPEC again had nothing
to do with it.
   With the producing countries making the decisions that oil
companies had once made, OPEC became irrelevant as a
collective bargaining agency. It took on, however, a new
mission in the 1980s: enforcing oil production quotas to
prevent oil prices from dropping. These efforts have
basically proven unsuccessful. Whatever results were achieved
were realized because Saudi Arabia sacrificed its own
interests and held its production far lower below capacity
than any of its OPEC partners.
   As the largest oil producer in OPEC and the possessor of
the largest reserves in the world as well, Saudi Arabia had
to assume the leadership of OPEC. But instead of offering
Saudi Arabia a vehicle to protect its national interest, OPEC
proved to be an instrument in the hands of its adversaries to
impose undesirable constraints upon Saudi decisions.
   The national interest of Saudi Arabia is obvious: stable
and reasonable oil prices. Oil prices should never be allowed
to rise to the point where energy alternatives become so
economically competitive as to displace oil. Saudi Arabia is
a one-resource country. It needs to market its oil for as
long as it lasts, which will be a long time.
   Other countries, with bigger populations and smaller
reserves, have different interests. And these countries have
often sought to use OPEC to impose their goals on Saudi
Arabia. In the 1970s, the Shah of Iran led the pack; today it
is the unholy alliance of the Ayatollahs and Saddam Hussein.
   It was these other interests that had begun to prevail
even before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The July OPEC
meeting agreed to raise the price of oil to $21 a barrel.
This was a clear threat to the Saudi interest in maintaining
the competitiveness of oil. After the turmoil of the early
1980s, oil prices collapsed and so did the demand for OPEC
oil. It took a long time for oil prices and consumption to
recover, but by the late 1980s the trends were encouraging.
Saudi Arabia could increase its income by boosting production
while maintaining the lower prices.
   Iraq and Iran, unable to increase output, advocated a rise
in oil prices. The July meeting, had its outcome not been
made obsolete by Iraq's military move, put Saudi Arabia in a
position where it would have had to choose between its own
interests and obeying an OPEC edict.
   In light of this discouraging history and to deprive its
enemies of whatever levers they enjoy under the OPEC
umbrella, Saudi Arabia should simply walk away from OPEC.
OPEC might be retained as a harmless but useful "trade
association" to collect information and publish oil
statistics. But Saudi Arabia should no longer permit it any
policy-making power.
   Saudi Arabia is the superpower of oil. With this status
come challenges and responsibilities -- challenges and
responsibilities that Saudi Arabia is fully capable of facing
without the OPEC cover.
   The Middle East is a nasty neighborhood with armed thugs
on the loose. We cannot do much about that, but the Saudis
owe it to themselves (and to the world) not to be exploited
by those thugs through the mechanism of OPEC.
