   Legg Mason Inc., Baltimore, said it reached an agreement
with Philadelphia-based First Fidelity Bancorp. to acquire
Latimer &amp; Buck, a mortgage banking unit of First Fidelity.
Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
   Latimer &amp; Buck's loan service portfolio exceeds $3.1
billion, and it manages about $1.1 billion in commercial real
estate and mortgage investments, primarily for state pension
funds. Latimer &amp; Buck, will operate as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Legg Mason.

   In July, First Fidelity said it would sell two units,
Latimer &amp; Buck and Fidelcor Business Credit Corp., and said
it expected to book a one-time gain in the third quarter.
Analysts estimate the one-time gain in the range of $60
million to $70 million. The sale is part of First Fidelity's
restructuring efforts to streamline operations.
   The companies anticipate the closing of the transaction,
which is subject to certain conditions, to occur by the end
of September.
   M. Walter D'Alessio will continue as chairman and chief
executive officer of Latimer &amp; Buck, and all current
employees will be able to stay with the firm.
