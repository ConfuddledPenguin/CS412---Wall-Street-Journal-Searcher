   In the days since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the United Nations
has acted with greater promptitude and cohesion than at any
time since the Korean War. Within 48 hours the U.N. Security
Council issued a resolution condemning the invasion,
demanding that Iraq withdraw, and invoking comprehensive
Chapter VII sanctions. Even more striking is the most recent
resolution authorizing member states to use minimal force to
enforce the sanctions. Even rogue states like Libya, Syria
and Iran have supported the U.N. actions and declared that
they will respect them. Armed with this universal solidarity,
the U.N. secretary general will meet with Iraq's foreign
minister today, leading some to hope that the U.N. will
provide an escape route from war.
   It is probably fair to say that the U.N. has never before
in its history looked more like the peacekeeping,
order-preserving institution it is supposed to be. Many
observers ascribe this to the apparent end of the Cold War.
There has certainly been an unprecedented degree of Soviet
cooperation with the Security Council's actions. But the
superpower conflict hasn't been the only, or, in many cases,
the main, obstacle to an effective U.N. response to regional
threats to peace.

   In fact, the Korean War is a good example of a tough U.N.
response against the wishes of the Soviet Union. Of course,
at the time the U.S. dominated the world scene. This nation's
relative power combined with the strong support of Western
Europe and the Latin American countries to give us an almost
automatic majority in the U.N. bodies. In the Korean case
this led to circumstances in which we could even circumvent
the Soviet veto on the Security Council.
   As Europe's colonial empires in Africa and Asia collapsed,
however, U.S. domination of the U.N. gave way to domination
by a new majority composed mainly of developing countries --
the so-called Third World. This majority has since determined
the issues that dominated the U.N.'s political agenda. Two
components of the majority, the Africans and the Arab states,
proved most effective at promoting their preoccupations,
South Africa and Israel, to the top of the U.N. agenda.
Beyond these regionally determined priorities, an
anti-colonial and leftist ideological thrust superficially
united the Third World majority. This gave the Soviets some
advantages in advancing their anti-Western agenda through
U.N. institutions.
   To see how destructively this arrangement has worked, it
helps to look at the numbers. A Heritage Foundation review of
voting patterns during the U.N.'s 44th General Assembly
(September-December 1989) shows that the rest of the world
voted the same way the U.S. did an average of only 17% of the
time. The average overall coincidence of voting with the
Soviet Union for these countries was by contrast 95%. On
Middle East questions, the rate was about the same. Some 94%
of U.N. members supported resolutions 44/40 A and 44/42,
which condemned Israel for being "terrorist" and "aggressive"
and called for Israeli withdrawal from "occupied
territories."
   Long before last fall, once it became clear that we could
no longer dominate its decisions, the U.S. ceased to take the
U.N.'s politics seriously. It seemed easier for us to use our
great power unilaterally, or to take advantage of the
superiority in bilateral relations that our global economic
dominance made possible.
   As a result, the U.N. ceased to be a viable instrument for
pursuing U.S. policy goals. Yet the Third World majority that
dominated its decisions had no effective power to translate
decision into action outside the U.N. In this sense the
great-power veto on the Security Council merely reflects
reality. Without involvement and support from the great
powers, the U.N. can't do much more than talk. The necessary
but not sufficient condition of its effectiveness is the
support, indeed the leadership, of a nation powerful enough
to add meaningful economic and political muscle to its
actions. The Third World majority can provide the chassis for
the U.N. vehicle. The great powers, and especially the U.S.,
must provide the engine.
   The U.N.'s remarkably cohesive response to Iraq's
aggression reflects a set of circumstances that have at least
temporarily pushed aside the factors that have rendered the
U.N. impotent. In the context of the Soviet Union's apparent
collapse in the Cold War competition, the U.S. has, for the
moment, emerged again in a position of undisputed global
preeminence.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait posed an immediate threat to
Saudi Arabia, whose wealth and quiet political skills have
made it a very influential player among Arab countries. Other
traditional or more moderate Arab regimes (Egypt and Morocco,
for example) also feel the shadow of this threat, while the
leaders of the radical states (such as Libya and Syria) don't
want to see Saddam Hussein achieve the Nasserite position of
dominance in Arab politics that will result if his bold move
against Kuwait succeeds. Given Iraq's regional military
dominance, and the Soviet Union's current weakness, the U.S.
represented the only power with the wherewithal to respond to
Iraq's move in time to forestall an Iraqi takeover of Saudi
Arabia.
   A combination of regional self-interest and U.S. readiness
have created an opportunity to fashion a coalition of support
for prompt, and even forceful, U.N. action. The Soviets are
in no position to oppose this coalition (which has some of
the same elements as the one that repeatedly secured passage
of resolutions in the General Assembly against the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan). In fact, since a prolonged crisis
in the Gulf will increase U.S. eagerness for continued good
relations, the Soviets have an interest in encouraging
international action -- with the U.S. in the lead role. Given
the importance of Middle Eastern oil to their economies, the
Europeans and the Japanese clearly have an important stake in
making sure that supplies are not disrupted, or permanently
controlled, by an Arab power less susceptible to their
influence than the Arab monarchies.
   It would be a mistake to believe that the U.N.'s ability
to deal with the Gulf situation means that the organization
itself has suddenly overcome its inherent structural and
political deficiencies. The organization is not a catalyst or
agent of events, it is more like a barometer. Its present
role reflects a certain state of existing interests and power
relations in the world. At the moment, those interests and
relations have allowed the U.S. to reassert the strong
leadership role that allowed the U.N. to take decisive action
in the early years of its existence. What we are witnessing
therefore tells us more about the current pre-eminence of the
U.S. than it does about the U.N.
   Even with that insight, we should be wary of concluding
that the U.N. has now become a routinely reliable instrument
for U.S. policy. The self-interest of certain Arab states
combined with our readiness and Soviet weakness have made the
current moment possible. The key factor, in U.N. terms, is
majority support in the Arab bloc. Even in the present crisis
it is not hard to envisage a change in that support over
time. If Saddam Hussein can foment anti-American,
anti-Western feeling among the Arab masses, this might weaken
the resolve of the vulnerable moderate and traditional
governments that are the core of the coalition that supports
our presence and forceful action in the region. Weakness at
the Arab core would give rise to European vacillation and
doubtless affect the Soviets' calculations about the wisdom
of being too positive in their cooperation with the
international effort built around U.S. power.
   We should also bear in mind that at some point this
situation may become the precedent for actions less consonant
with U.S. interests than at present. Will we someday find
ourselves called upon to acquiesce in an effort built around
Soviet military power (which still exists, by the way,
despite current Soviet preoccupations that discourage its
use), aimed at South Africa or Israel, with an African or
more radical Arab majority at its core? The U.N. remains a
highly politicized arena, in which -- for the moment --
global and regional circumstances favor our leadership.
Circumstances can change, however. Rather than betting on
naive theories about a fundamental reform of the U.N.'s weak
character, we should constantly remember that there can be no
substitute for our own prudence, diplomacy and decisiveness.
