   Medical researchers cleared the last big scientific hurdle
to gene-based treatment of major diseases by implanting a
nonhuman gene into patients in a clinical trial.
   Proponents believe the accomplishment will lead to new
treatments for cancer, immune system ailments and hereditary
diseases.

   "It's the first time that foreign genes have been
introduced into humans," said Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of
surgery at the National Cancer Institute and the leader of
the team that performed the experiment. "It's the base from
which we will begin using gene therapy to help people who are
sick."
   In the trial, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues attached a
special marker gene with no therapeutic value to certain
cancer-fighting cells in five patients with advanced
melanoma, a fatal skin cancer. The implanted gene survived in
all five patients for at least 19 days -- and in one patient
for as long as 189 days; it turned up in the tumors of three
of the five patients, who suffered no side effects attributed
to the gene. "This showed the genes can be introduced safely
and efficiently," Dr. Rosenberg said. "Now we just have to
learn how to apply it to a variety of diseases."
   Years of work in both the laboratory and the clinic remain
before effective gene-based treatments are widely available.
But the accomplishment "is tantamount to the first satellite
that was launched that showed we could escape gravity," said
Nathan A. Berger, a researcher at Ireland Cancer Center,
University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland. "That opened up the whole space program. This is
going to open up a whole new era of gene transplant for
therapeutic purposes."
   The results also strengthen the belief that doctors can
use the body's innate cancer-fighting cells as couriers to
deliver cells with more powerful, gene-modified anti-cancer
properties to tumors. The next step is to replace the inert
marker gene with such potent genes in an effort to shrink or
eliminate the tumors.
   A report on Dr. Rosenberg's work appears in today's New
England Journal of Medicine. Collaborators include Michael
Blaese, also of the cancer institute, and W. French Anderson,
of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Some of the
results were previously disclosed at scientific meetings.
   The first tests of gene therapy are expected to be on
melanoma patients and on children with severe combined immune
deficiency, or ADA deficiency, which leaves victims
vulnerable to death from infection. Proposals for these
experiments were approved late last month by the National
Institutes of Health and await clearance by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. Dr. Rosenberg said the treatments could
begin within two months.
   Current immune system approaches to cancer have been only
partly successful. Although some patients have achieved total
remission for months or even years, immunotherapy works only
about half the time, and in most patients lasts only for a
short period before tumors begin growing again. "There's
enormous room for improvement," Dr. Rosenberg says.
   While the anti-cancer strategy calls for genes to bolster
the body's existing cancer-fighting agents, scientists will
try a different tack against ADA deficiency. Here they will
seek to insert a gene that makes an enzyme called adenosine
deaminase, which eliminates toxic wastes from the body.
Victims of the disease lack the gene and thus don't produce
the enzyme. Similar efforts are expected in treatment of such
ills as sickle-cell anemia, muscular dystrophy and
hemophilia.
   Some researchers are looking at bone marrow cells or skin
cells as possible places to implant therapeutic genes, Dr.
Berger said. Dr. Rosenberg has focused on lymphocytes, or
certain white blood cells, as part of his strategy to marshal
the body's own immune system to fight cancer. In the latest
experiment, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues attached the
gene marker to cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes,
or TILs, which congregate in tumors as part of the body's
immune response to invading cancer cells.
   The researchers extracted TILs from the patients' tumors
and steeped them in interleukin-2, a growth factor
manufactured by Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., to produce
huge amounts of the cancer-fighting TILs. Patients were also
treated intravenously with doses of interleukin-2. In
previous trials, the researchers have reinfused these TILs
into cancer patients. Tumors shrank in about half the cases,
and total remissions resulted in about 10% of patients.
   This time, researchers added another step, splicing the
gene marker into the mixture before reinfusing it. The marker
gene was derived from bacteria resistant to the antibiotic
neomycin. Later, the scientists exposed tumor biopsies and
blood samples to neomycin. The antibiotic killed cells that
lacked the resistant marker gene, but some cells survived the
antibiotic, proving that the implanted gene -- and its TIL
companion -- survived in the blood stream or had traveled to
the tumor. Had the body's immune system attacked the foreign
gene, it would have been a major setback to the gene-therapy
effort.
   Tumors regressed in all three patients whose tumors showed
evidence of the marker gene and one patient remains in total
remission 13 months after the therapy. These patients
responded to the TIL treatment itself, not to the marker
gene, the researchers said. The other two patients died
within a year of the start of treatment from progressive
cancer.
   The hope is that replacing the marker gene with a gene
having tumor-fighting properties, such as tumor necrosis
factor, interleukin-2 or interferon alpha, will enhance the
TILs' ability to kill the cancer cells. The experiment also
showed that some TILs are more capable of migrating to tumors
than others. Extracting these "tumor-reactive" TILs,
cultivating them with interleukin-2 and reinfusing them could
result in more effective treatment, whether or not they
carried gene-spliced cargo to the tumor.
