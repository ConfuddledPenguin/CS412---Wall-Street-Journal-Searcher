   TOKYO -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan unveiled a
package of financial, logistical and medical contributions as
its part of the effort to enforce the sanctions against Iraq,
calling them "the utmost" the country can do under its
war-renouncing constitution.
   Japanese officials emphasized that this was the first time
Japan has taken part in a tense military confrontation in a
distant region since World War II. They pleaded for
international understanding of the country's inability to
send military forces or weapons.

   But it's unclear what kind of reviews the package will get
abroad. The U.S., in particular, has been pressuring Japan
for a sizable contribution to the region. But many details of
the package remain to be worked out, and Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe declined to put a price tag on it.
   Late Thursday morning in Tokyo, Mr. Watanabe said that
after an evening of strenuous internal negotiations, Japan
had decided to estimate the value of its logistical and
medical contributions at $1 billion but still didn't have any
total figure for its contributions to countries in the
region.
   Japanese press reports said Mr. Kaifu explained the
package to President Bush by telephone before unveiling it in
a televised news conference. The reports said Mr. Bush
expressed understanding but urged Japan to do more. Briefing
foreign reporters, Mr. Watanabe declined to confirm whether
the call had taken place.
   In Washington, Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, said the measures announced by Japan were
"useful initial steps in responding to the Persian Gulf
crisis." She made clear that the U.S. was hoping for further
actions. "We look forward to discussing with Japan the exact
details of what Japan will do, as we consider what further
steps and contributions might be necessary as the situation
in the Gulf evolves," she said.
   Under the package, Japan will help transport food, water
and medical supplies to the U.S.-led multinational forces in
the Persian Gulf area and dispatch a 100-person civilian
medical team. Japan will also give at least $10 million to
help evacuees from Kuwait and Iraq and will help the
economies of Turkey, Jordan and Egypt with an unspecified sum
of low-interest loans and grants.
   "It's difficult to say whether it's millions of dollars or
billions of dollars," Mr. Watanabe said of the loans and
grants.
   It's also difficult to estimate the price tag of the whole
package. The only figure mentioned in the government's
seven-paragraph press release is the $10 million. According
to an air-cargo industry source, a charter flight from Japan
to the Middle East would cost about $650,000 plus insurance.
But it's not clear how many flights will be covered under the
package.
   Bureaucrats crafted the measures to minimize domestic
controversy over the constitutionality of assisting a
military operation outside Japan. The country won't send any
members of its euphemistically named Self-Defense Forces. The
private Japanese ships and planes that the government will
charter won't carry any munitions or weaponry, a condition
insisted on by some unionized crews.
   But the government could come under fire domestically over
one provision of the package. In addition to chartering its
own ships and planes to carry food, water and medical
supplies, Japan will help pay for charters by other
countries. The foreign ships and planes chartered by these
Japanese payments may be used to transfer munitions and
weaponry.
   Mr. Kaifu, defending his package, said: "We cannot afford
to be seen not doing anything about a problem which threatens
our own national interests." He suggested that Japan adopt a
"United Nations Peace Cooperation Law" that would enable the
country to react more quickly in the future. But he didn't
say when, if at all, he might introduce such legislation, nor
what exactly it might stipulate.
   Some senior conservative politicians have called in recent
days for legislation that would allow Japan to dispatch its
Self-Defense Forces overseas. But Mr. Kaifu gave no sign of
supporting their call.
   While declining to give examples of the kind of equipment
Japan might supply, he said the country would give the U.S.
and other countries a list of all the equipment available in
Japan and pay for any of it they chose. After exhausting
Japan's supplies of such equipment, Japan would buy similar
items in other countries for use by the multinational forces.
   Mr. Watanabe said some American officials had been briefed
on this plan, "and the reaction was positive."
   Japanese officials hope to work out the details of its aid
to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt before Mr. Kaifu visits those
countries along with Oman and Saudi Arabia, probably in early
October. Mr. Watanabe said the aid would be based on requests
from the countries, which are now being reviewed.
   The process is taking longer than expected, he said, in
part because some countries, instead of asking for grants as
expected, asked for low-interest loans and technical
cooperation. But Mr. Watanabe emphasized that at least part
of the "significant magnitude" of aid that Japan will give
will be outright grants.
   A senior Finance Ministry official had said previously
that Japan wanted aid to be financed by several big countries
jointly and funneled through the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund. The government's news release suggested that
Japan would give the aid both directly and through the World
Bank and IMF, but Mr. Watanabe said that "even if we go ahead
with unilateral aid, we want to have multilateral
coordination."
