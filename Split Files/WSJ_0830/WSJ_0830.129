   CHICAGO -- University of Chicago researchers said they
developed a solar device that can concentrate sunlight to an
intensity 15% greater than on the surface of the sun itself.
   Roland Winston, head of the Department of Physics and a
researcher, said scientists have been trying to heighten the
intensity of collected sunlight because a highly concentrated
beam of light could someday power laser communication in
space or incinerate hazardous wastes, among other uses.

   The group's feat, which amounted to concentrating sunlight
to 84,000 times its normal intensity on Earth, surpasses the
previous record achieved by the researchers in 1988 by 40%,
he said.
   He said the group achieved the feat by first using a
conventional telescope mirror to focus the light to a
square-centimeter area. A precisely machined cone of sapphire
then concentrated that focused light into a square-millimeter
area. Key to the advance in intensity was a sapphire that was
"mathematically designed" to give the maximum possible
refractive index, or ability to bend light.
   In the latest experiments, the researchers measured the
energy output of the solar collector by heating fluid. The
solar collector generated 72 watts a square millimeter,
compared with 63 watts generated at the surface of the sun.
Normal sunlight that reaches Earth amounts to less than
one-thousandth of a watt a square millimeter.
