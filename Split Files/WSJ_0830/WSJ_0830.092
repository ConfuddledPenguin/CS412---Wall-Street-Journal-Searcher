   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. urged
Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co. to meet with its officials before
entering talks with any other potential buyers.
   Kansas City P&amp;L last month launched an unsolicited
$27-a-share, or $857 million, tender offer for the Wichita
utility. But Kansas G&amp;E rebuffed the offer as inadequate and
overly conditional, saying also that the bid "raises
substantial and serious legal questions and numerous
uncertainties under state and federal statutes."

   Earlier this week, Kansas G&amp;E disclosed in a Securities
and Exchange filing that it might consider a merger or
recapitalization plan as a means of foiling its unwanted
suitor.
   In a letter made public yesterday, Kansas City P&amp;L
President and Chief Executive Officer Drue Jennings told
Kansas G&amp;E Chairman and President Wilson K. Cadman: "We are
concerned that KG&amp;E's statement indicates that you may enter
discussions with third parties without also engaging in
discussions with us."
   Mr. Jennings urged: "Let's meet before you take any steps,
such as agreeing to substantial commitment and other fees or
agreeing to merge with, or sell significant assets to, a
third party."
   Kansas City P&amp;L's offer has been extended until Sept. 14;
at the time the original expired Aug. 20, about 43% of Kansas
G&amp;E's common shares had been tendered.
