   NEW YORK -- Another steep decline in crude-oil prices and
heightened optimism about the prospects for a peaceful
resolution of the Mideast conflict sent stock prices higher,
but trading remained light.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 17.58 to 2632.43
amid reports pointing toward a more conciliatory position by
Iraq and news that most members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to permit increased
oil production.

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 972 to 508 on
the New York exchange. Among broader market indexes, Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 2.85 to 324.19, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.52 to 177.78 and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 2.46 to 300.13.
   Big Board volume rose slightly, to 134,240,000 shares from
127,650,000 Tuesday, but the total reflected several large
block trades that appeared to be designed to capture
quarterly dividend payments.
   Also, traders noted that buying and selling resulting from
stock-index arbitrage contributed to the market's volatility,
as arbitrage buying surfaced just after midday and some
arbitrage selling cut into the market's gains late in the
session.
   Based on yesterday's closing price levels, the stage may
be set for further index-arbitrage selling as trading opens
today. September contracts on the S&amp;P 500 finished at 323.85,
a discount of nearly 1/2 point to the cash index.
   In recent days, "fair value" for the S&amp;P 500 contract -- a
price level that reflects the different costs and benefits of
owning futures as opposed to stocks -- has been about one
point above the cash index, according to a trader at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Stocks spent the first half of the latest session drifting
within narrow trading ranges, duplicating their performance
Tuesday when the Dow Jones industrials eked out a 3.22-point
gain.
   However, as crude-oil prices tumbled below $26 a barrel in
New York trading, "oil started to dictate where {stocks} were
going," said Jeffrey Kaminsky, head of block trading at
Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co.
   The October futures contract for light crude oil retreated
$1.96 a barrel, to $25.92, amid expectations that OPEC's
accord would resolve the shortfall in oil output stemming
from the Mideast crisis.
   Separately, Iraq reportedly offered to withdraw from
Kuwait and release all foreign hostages if certain conditions
were satisfied -- a proposal coming the day before a meeting
between United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   However, the market's late pullback reflected some renewed
concerns that the Middle East situation could deteriorate.
And the White House denied that it has received any direct
offer from Baghdad.
   "That fear is still overhanging the market, even though
the picture is improving a little bit as far as oil prices
and the overall status" of the Mideast situation are
concerned, said Joseph J. McAlinden, director of research at
Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Food, beverage and drug issues were among the session's
best performers as market players continued to steer toward
groups whose earnings are considered least likely to falter
in a weak economy.
   Philip Morris added 1/2 to 45 1/2 in composite trading of
2.6 million shares, while Coca-Cola gained 1 to 42 3/4,
Hershey Foods climbed 1 7/8 to 37 1/2 and Merck rose 1 1/8 to
82.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 1 3/8 to 60 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares amid word that the Food and Drug Administration had
set Oct. 16 as the date for an advisory committee to conduct
a review of Pravachol, the company's cholesterol drug. The
news prompted analysts at Goldman Sachs and Cowen &amp; Co. to
repeat their buy recommendations, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Three of the Big Board's most active issues were among
apparent targets of dividend-capture trades by institutions:
Texas Utilities, which dipped 1/8 to 33 7/8 on volume of 3.9
million shares; First Interstate Bancorp, which added 1/4 to
28 7/8 on 3.5 million shares; and First Bank System, which
lost 1/4 to 12 3/4 on 2.1 million shares.
   U.S. Shoe dropped 3/4 to 13 3/8. The company reported that
net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 4 fell
29% from a year earlier.
   Perkin-Elmer gained 1 3/8 to 22 7/8. In reporting that
earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in July were up 3% from
a year ago, the company pointed to "operational improvements"
growing out of a recent restructuring, such as stronger cash
flow and "accelerating order growth" for new instrument
products.
   Anthem Electronics plunged 3 3/8 to 21 1/2. Smith Barney,
Harris Upham lowered the stock's investment rating to hold
from buy and reduced its 1990 and 1991 earnings projections.
Analyst James L. Barlage told the Dow Jones investor report
that he has turned cautious on the company's shortterm
prospects as a result of continuing "spotty order patterns"
in its third quarter and the possibility of a U.S. recession
ahead.
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric rose 3/4 to 25 1/2. The company,
targeted in a $27-a-share takeover offer from Kansas City
Power &amp; Light, disclosed that it may hold discussions about
its possible merger or reorganization, among other things.
Kansas City P&amp;L went up 1/8 to 29 3/4 on one million shares,
with dividend-related trades accounting for most of the
activity.
   Beazer added 3/8 to 10 3/8. The company agreed to sell a
50% stake in its Midlothian, Texas, cement manufacturing
plant for about $45 million to a U.S. unit of Pioneer
International, another British-based firm.
   Talley Industries, which said it stands to benefit from
General Motors' decision to boost the number of U.S.-built
cars equipped with air bags, rose 1 to 6 5/8. Under a 12-year
royalty agreement with TRW, which acquired the company's
airbag business in April 1989, Talley receives payments for
every bag sold in North America by any manufacturer and for
every bag sold by TRW world-wide.
   Stanley Works added 3/4 to 30 3/8. The company's board
approved the repurchase of as many as three million common
shares and raised its quarterly dividend 11% to 30 cents a
share.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 2.45
to 324.23. Volume totaled 11,670,000 shares.
