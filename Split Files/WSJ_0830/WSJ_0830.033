   FLINT, Mich. -- Action Auto Stores Inc. said it will
auction pieces of its property next month in an effort to

   The automotive-parts retailer said it hopes to raise about
$8 million from the sale of more than 50 property sites
throughout Michigan.

   The company in June filed a petition for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
