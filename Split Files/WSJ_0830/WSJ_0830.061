   LONDON -- Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC Chairman and
Chief Executive Robert Maxwell, his family and related
interests increased their collective stake in MCC to 28% from
about 26%, the group said.
   Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC, a Maxwell investment
vehicle, purchased a 2% stake, or 10 million shares, in MCC.
The trust last week made a slightly larger purchase of 15.6
million shares, which took the Maxwell stake to 26%.

   Mr. Maxwell couldn't be immediately reached for comment on
the purchases.
   MCC's shares closed yesterday at 168 pence ($3.27),
unchanged on the day. Mr. Maxwell and his interests now
control 181.6 million shares in the publishing and
communications concern.
   The shares stand near the low for the year of 162.5 pence,
and well below the year's high of 234 pence.
