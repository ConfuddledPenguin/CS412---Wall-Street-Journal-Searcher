   OSAKA, Japan -- As technological breakthroughs go, strides
in computer screens may seem to be a mundane matter. But to
some in Japan, it's gripping stuff.
   In a 20-page comic book published in May by a Japanese
business magazine, Sharp Corp. scientists sweat over
microscopes, and demanding executives pound on their desks as
the company rises to leadership in liquid-crystal displays
(LCDs), a key ingredient in shrinking personal computers into
popular laptops.

   The company's first real-life derring-do comes in October.
At a plant near its headquarters here, Sharp will begin mass
producing the specialized color LCDs that are likely to
become the industry standard in the next five years.
   Other major Japanese electronics companies are transfixed
by Sharp's progress. Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and NEC
Corp., among others, plot their own strategies. For many,
only semiconductors will take up more of their research and
production budgets. "In terms of importance to the {computer
system,} our executives say the {1990s equivalent of the DRAM
chip} is LCDs," says Takashi Shimada, the top engineer in
Toshiba's electron tube and device group.
   Japan's rush into technology's latest commercial frontier
is good news for consumers seeking smaller computers. But for
some Americans, it's cause for concern. In Washington
yesterday, the International Trade Commission ruled
unanimously that U.S. producers are being hurt by imports of
Japanese thin-panel displays. That was in response to a July
petition by seven small U.S. companies trying to enter the
market. They accused Japan's 12 electronics giants of
"dumping" -- selling the screens in the U.S. at prices below
their production or home-market prices -- to monopolize the
market.
   Yesterday's ruling means the U.S. Commerce Department will
continue investigating the allegations, which cover imports
valued at more than $90 million a year, and will issue its
own preliminary ruling by Dec. 26. An affirmative decision
could result in stiff duties on imports.
   To many analysts, however, U.S. companies would have a
tough time jumping in, regardless of Japanese behavior. The
advent of a new generation of LCDs, they say, is a stark
illustration of the slippery slope of dependence that starts
when a country forsakes critical technologies. In the 1980s,
Japan virtually chased the U.S. out of the basic memory-chip
business, as well as many of the peripheral-equipment
markets. That may come back to haunt the U.S. industry. The
same techniques used to make chips and printers are the keys
to making LCDs.
   Indeed, International Business Machines Corp. opposes the
dumping petition, claiming that no U.S. producer has been
able to meet its needs for LCDs. The U.S. computer maker, in
a joint venture with Toshiba, is the only major U.S. computer
company currently entering the business.
   U.S. computer companies don't make their own conventional
screens now. But as a mature product, the standard cathode
ray tubes (CRTs) are commodities, readily obtainable from
many different suppliers. That's not the case with
sophisticated LCDs. They will be available mainly from Japan
for the foreseeable future, and U.S. companies shouldn't
expect easy access to those supplies, especially while
capacity is limited and the technology is still being
perfected.
   "It may be difficult," says Atsushi Asada, a senior
executive vice president at Sharp, "to meet demand." NEC will
only make the screens for in-house use.
   Moreover, Japanese screen makers may have an incentive to
withhold the new LCDs, which started going on sale a few
months ago. The Japanese companies are increasingly making
the computers as well as the screens, turning them into
competitors of the U.S. companies that they are supplying.
   This could be very bad news for U.S. computer makers. The
laptop market, which is already dominated by the Japanese, is
the fastest-growing segment in the computer industry. Andrew
Grove, the outspoken chief executive officer of Intel Corp.,
a leading microprocessor maker, predicted to reporters in
June that the growth of portables would help Japan pass the
U.S. as the world's largest computer maker by 1992, taking
42% of the market.
   The principles behind the LCD screen were first discovered
by RCA Corp. in 1963. Liquid crystals, when charged with
light, line up parallel to the electric field. The crystals
can be manipulated either to block light or to let it pass
through, thus creating images.
   Big U.S. companies failed to pursue practical
applications, but the Japanese, most notably Sharp,
persisted. In 1973, Sharp sold the first LCD-screen
calculator. The technology quickly spread to a number of
other small consumer appliances, such as wristwatches.
   LCDs had certain limits, however: they had to be kept
small, could only work in black and white, and were slow to
respond. In recent years, the technology has improved enough
to work in laptops, with the 27-millimeter-thick,
10-inch-diagonal LCDs replacing bulky CRTs, which are seven
centimeters thick by comparison. But the screens still can be
slow and difficult to read.
   Now that the breakthroughs are starting to appear,
however, the major Japanese makers are investing heavily.
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.'s Tokyo office, in a report
published in December, estimated the Japanese will spend
roughly 350 billion yen ($2.44 billion) in the next three
years to build LCD plants.
   Many different LCD approaches exist, but most of the
companies have turned to a technology called active-matrix,
thin-film transistors. A black-and-white screen requires only
a matrix of wires, with the intersecting dots controlling the
image. But crossing wires are too imprecise, especially for
color. So the companies are making screens with a separate
transistor for each dot with the appropriate use of primary
color filters to create the desired color. The production
techniques are similar to semiconductor manufacturing, using
clean rooms, thin films of material and sophisticated
etching.
   That approach is fraught with problems, most notably that
the quality requirements for LCDs are much higher than for
semiconductors. One bad dot in a million can ruin a screen.
The Japanese press estimates that as much as 80% of the
current output gets scrapped. That means the best target for
cost per screen at the end of next year is still a pricey
200,000 to 300,000 yen, according to Sharp's Mr. Asada. His
goal is to cut that to 50,000 yen to 80,000 yen in five
years.
   But the Japanese makers are confident of success. The
industry estimates, according to Jardine, that LCDs will take
more than half the PC display market by 1995. That would be
$12.5 billion in revenue, or the equivalent of nearly
one-third the total Japanese consumer electronics output.
   The makers also are looking beyond computer displays to
put their LCDs in a range of new products, such as automobile
navigation systems, high-definition TVs, and optoelectronic
computing. Those companies that dominate the LCD technology,
analysts say, will likely have the edge in those markets,
too.
