   NEW YORK -- Horn &amp; Hardart Co. agreed to sell its
Bojangles chain of chicken restaurants to a unit of Sienna
Holdings, a closely held Los Angeles investment firm.
   In return for Bojangles, which is profitable, Horn &amp;
Hardart will receive a $20 million, 14% senior subordinated
debt that Sienna holds. Horn &amp; Hardart is selling the
restaurant chain as part of a plan to focus on its
direct-marketing operations.
