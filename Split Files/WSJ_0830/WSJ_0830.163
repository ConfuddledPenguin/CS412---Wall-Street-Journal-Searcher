   WASHINGTON -- Saddam Hussein damped hopes there might be a
quick negotiated settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis, as
the U.S. announced that it was rushing jet fighters, tanks
and Stinger missiles to Saudi Arabia.
   In an interview on CBS television, the Iraqi president
said, "Kuwait is part of Iraq," and he denied reports that he
had offered any concessions to the U.S. to defuse the
standoff in the Gulf. At the same time, he tried to sound a
conciliatory tone, asserting that he was "prepared to conduct
a dialogue" with President Bush and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.

   Even when asked provocative questions, including one about
the comparison President Bush drew between him and Adolf
Hitler, Saddam Hussein remained calm and spoke in carefully
measured terms. But at one point he did show a flash of anger
toward Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, an outspoken Arab
critic of the Iraqi invasion, saying Mr. Mubarak "no longer
is a friend."
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials last night said they were still
waiting for Saddam Hussein to fulfill his promise to release
U.S. women and children who have been held hostage in Iraq
and Kuwait. Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, said Baghdad asked U.S. officials for the names
of those who want to leave in order to give them exit visas.
She said: "We are responding to that request." If Iraq lets
these foreigners go, she said, it would be "a significant
step in the right direction."
   Saddam Hussein's combination of defiant statements and
promises, in the view of a senior State Department official,
is part of a campaign to buy time in hopes of sowing disunity
among the nations that are arrayed against Iraq. In addition
to his interview with CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, the
Iraqi dictator appeared yesterday on French television.
   There were reports yesterday that the Bush administration
had received a number of overtures from intermediaries
claiming to represent Iraq. But the White House denied that
it has received any direct offer from Baghdad.
   One report, in the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday,
said that an unidentified official from a past U.S.
administration suggested recently to National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft that Iraq might be willing to
withdraw its troops from Kuwait on the following conditions:
an end to United Nations sanctions, guaranteed access to the
Persian Gulf and ownership of a disputed oil field on the
Iraq-Kuwait border.
   The White House confirmed that such a meeting occurred.
But a spokesman said, "There was nothing in this particular
proposal that merited its pursuit." It was unclear where the
ideas originated.
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, is sending tough
signals to Saddam Hussein. In a radio message to U.S. forces
sweltering in Saudi Arabia's desert, President Bush said,
"Nobody's feeling the heat more than the government in
Baghdad." Separately, NBC News reported last night that the
U.S. is providing intelligence and training to the Kuwaiti
resistance movement, which it said is mounting daily
guerrilla raids inside the occupied country.
   The administration also confirmed that it is selling about
$2.3 billion of weapons to Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15
aircraft, 150 M-60 tanks, 50 Stinger anti-aircraft launchers
and missiles and 150 spare Stinger missiles and 1,500 rounds
of depleted uranium anti-tank ammunition.
   The White House signaled that the arms sale is just the
beginning of a broader U.S. effort to arm the Saudis. "We are
also looking at additional arms sales in the near term and
long range to help provide the Saudis with the force
structure necessary to help them defend themselves," said a
White House spokesman.
   A group of U.S. Jewish leaders met recently with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and expressed support for the
administration's policy, including its decision to provide
"assistance for the defense of Saudi Arabia, to deal with the
present emergency," according to a statement released by the
group.
   But the prospect of a continued military buildup in Saudi
Arabia is creating some concern among Israel's supporters in
the U.S. An official at Aipac, the major pro-Israel lobbying
group, said yesterday that Jewish leaders are worried that
the weapons being sent to the Saudis someday could be turned
against Israel. "It's simply an objective fact that this
stuff will be a substantial problem for Israel in the
future," he said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said they see little basis for
negotiating with Iraq in the reported unofficial feelers that
are surfacing in Washington.
   The U.S. would be loath to grant Iraq possession of an oil
field in return for a withdrawal from Kuwait, for instance,
because such a concession would be seen as a reward for Iraqi
aggression. In addition, an Iraqi request for guaranteed
"access" to the Persian Gulf is widely viewed as a disguised
demand for possession of strategic Bubiyan Island -- a
Kuwaiti island just beyond the mouth of the narrow Shatt
alrab waterway, now Iraq's only path to the Gulf. Iraq has
long coveted the island, but Kuwait has refused to consider
giving it up.
   The flurry of reports about possible Iraqi offers precedes
a meeting between United Nations Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
scheduled for today in Jordan. The U.S. has said it approves
of that meeting, but Washington professes to have little
expectation that it will bring about an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
