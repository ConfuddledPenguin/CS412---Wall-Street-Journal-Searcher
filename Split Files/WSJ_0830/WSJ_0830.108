   WASHINGTON -- President Bush's nominations to the newly
created Federal Housing Finance Board are being stalled by a
dispute with members of Congress over whether the positions
should be filled on a full-time basis.
   In a letter to the president last week, Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich) asked Mr. Bush to
withdraw the names of the four nominees if they are unwilling
to accept full-time positions. Sen. Riegle said he hadn't
scheduled confirmation hearings because the disagreement with
the Bush administration, which wants the four to serve part
time, hasn't been resolved.

   In addition, consumer groups have called for hearings on
the nominees, particularly Daniel Evans, who is chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and a longtime
associate of Vice President Dan Quayle. Mr. Evans, the
Consumer Federation of America contends, may have a conflict
of interest because his law firm has represented a bank whose
parent company has acquired defunct savings and loans.
   The five-member housing finance board was created by last
year's thrift-bailout law to regulate the nation's 12 home
loan banks, which have 3,200 S&amp;L members. (The secretary of
housing and urban development is a permanent member.) The
member thrifts buy shares in the home loan banks and get
lower interest rates for mortgages.
   Chase Untermeyer, director of presidential personnel, said
the White House counsel's office is "absolutely vigilant"
about potential conflicts of interest. "They would not let
anybody out" who even appeared to have a conflict, he added.
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the House
Banking Committee, argues that a part-time board "where
members maintain employment and business interests in the
private sector can be the breeding grounds for serious
conflict-of-interest situations."
   In his letter last week, Mr. Riegle also urged the
president not to give the nominees recess appointments, as
the White House has considered doing. Recess appointments are
made when Congress isn't in session and therefore can't hold
confirmation hearings. Recess appointees can hold office
until the subsequent session expires, which in this case
could be about a year.
   Mr. Untermeyer said making recess appointments is "an idea
that's in the air," but added there are no plans to make any
housing finance board appointments during the current recess.
   The Consumer Federation of America has called for the
Senate's full confirmation process to examine Mr. Evans's
relationship with Bank One in Indianapolis, whose parent
company, Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, has purchased
thrifts in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio. He is a partner in the
Indianapolis law firm of Baker &amp; Daniels, which has
represented Bank One. Mr. Evans also served as chairman of
the Quayle for Vice President Committee in 1988 and as
director of the vice president-elect's transition team.
   Sen. Riegle has asked the American law division of the
Library of Congress to study the part-time, full-time issue.
Administration officials say a part-time board would be able
to meet its responsibilities fully and would have the
flexibility to work as much as is necessary.
   Mr. Untermeyer, in an Aug. 13 letter, told the consumer
group that the administration believes part-time members
could "fully discharge the important responsibilities given
it." Part-time status would allow them to work as much as
needed, including every day during some months, he said.
