   Oka, Quebec -- Sometimes it's tough to get a reservation
in a good restaurant. When I telephoned L'Auberge Clementine
in this village just an hour's drive west of Montreal, the
answering machine said in French: "We're sorry we can't take
your call. We hope the crisis will be over soon."
   Clementine is a country inn famous for its fresh foie gras
from local ducks, for squab with mushrooms and wild rice,
pheasant breasts with cool sweet pepper sauce, quail with
wild garlic and apple brandy. Owner-chefs Michel and Louise
Beaulne have based their menu on the rich agricultural
resources of the surrounding region. But they currently are
unable to serve this sublimation of cuisine quebecoise
because their previously idyllic village has been under siege
for weeks over an issue of Indian land claims. Townspeople
have been caught in a confrontation between radical Mohawks
and the Quebec provincial police.

   Until the Mohawks dug in at Oka -- after the municipality
threatened to expand the local golf course onto
Indian-claimed land -- it was just another pretty little
Quebec town just a couple of hours from Ottawa. If known at
all, it was for the restaurant and for a smooth cheese
similar to Port Salut that is made by Trappist monks who've
been there since 1788.
   This summer in Oka, a baleful standoff has been
maintained, the Mohawks entrenched behind their blockade at
the top of a hill on the town's main street, the police at
the bottom of the slope in scattered groups behind concrete
barriers. TV pictures have shown grim-faced government
ministers marching up the hill for a series of stalemated
talks, and journalists who have been allowed into the Indian
encampment have brought back reports of radical activists
from outside Oka, allegedly including some American Indians,
trained ex-Vietnam vets. They are heavily armed with
semiautomatic weapons, Uzis, even rocket launchers, and are
said to have taken control of the local group. No one except
local residents and those with special accreditation have
been allowed in or out of the town for weeks.
   Inside Oka, there is an eerie quality to its abandoned
streets with their well-kept houses, trimmed lawns and hedges
and colorful municipal flowerpots hanging from the lampposts.
Many residents have left to stay elsewhere. Down along the
water's edge, past the deserted beaches of the marina with
its grounded boats, is Clementine, a comfortable old
Quebec-style house overlooking Lac Deux Montagnes. Mrs.
Beaulne bursts from the door and hugs me, a welcome stranger
in the tense, hushed world that this town has become.
   Twenty yards from the front door a squad of police, some
with shotguns cradled in their arms, lounge under a brightly
striped marquee set up to protect them from the sun. Inside,
tables still are set for guests with pretty apricot
tablecloths, white lace overlays, copper salvers at each
place; the vases on each table still contain a few fresh
flowers. Around the warmly panelled room are hung antique
platters and old photographs, including one of a beautiful
young woman taken in 1898. It turns out to be Clementine,
Mrs. Beaulne's grandmother, who was, in her day, a celebrated
cook in Oka. Many of the restaurant's recipes, Mrs. Beaulne
explains, are based on Clementine's: traditional dishes of
Quebec, tourtiere, or meat pie, ragout des pattes de cochon,
a pig-foot stew, and for dessert, sugar pies made from maple
syrup. Over time, Mr. Beaulne has refined this heavy country
fare into the elaborate and delicious sounding plates now on
offer: oak leaf lettuce with smoked game meat, maple-flavored
quails from the region, carefully de-boned young saddle of
rabbit glazed with a honey and citrus sauce.
   As head of the local businessmen's group, Mr. Beaulne has
been in meetings all morning with a government minister
discussing compensation for local farmers and businessmen.
Unharvested raspberry crops lie rotting in the fields and
some farmers, Mr. Beaulne explains when he joins us, have
even been prevented from moving their cattle from one
pasturage to another. He himself is losing thousands of
dollars weekly, but thinks he'll be okay if things are
settled quickly. His neighbor at the marina and others in the
town aren't so secure. They have big mortgages. They rely on
the summer season to make money and many are close to
bankruptcy.
   The Beaulnes are disgusted with their government, both
provincial and federal. With political relations between
Quebec and Canada at an all time low this summer after the
collapse of the Meech Lake accord -- which was supposed to
declare Quebec a "distinct society" within Canada -- neither
authority has moved to help Oka.
   Mrs. Beaulne, who doubles as the pastry chef and hostess
for Clementine, slips away and returns with coffee and a
promised "light" dessert she has prepared. It's a fluffy
floating island in a rosehued pool of fresh raspberry coulis
set off by a single nasturtium. The talk turns to food and
how the Beaulnes discovered, almost by accident, the bounty
from the farms around Oka. "One day I was out of pheasant and
my supplier from Montreal was late," Mr. Beaulne says. "Then
I discovered the guy up the road was raising pheasant and I
could buy them for half the price." Not only was it "fabulous
for freshness," he goes on, but "I started to buy locally for
the money. I could offer a pheasant breast with cranberries
for six bucks less than my competitor]"
   Soon he had organized the local farms into a small company
that supplied him, and later local groceries and
supermarkets, with everything from lettuce to cheeses as well
as hormone-free ducks and chickens and delicious Quebec beef,
which previously had been shipped to Western Canada as cattle
for fattening and for the stamp that declared it western
beef. "I really went overboard with local produce," he says
now, recalling how he got one village market gardener to
switch her entire crop from vegetables to raspberries.
   As we talk, Mr. Beaulne absently waves away a garbage
truck that has backed into the driveway. No garbage today.
   Soon it is time to go, and back outside we reenter a war
zone. A short stroll around the corner from the restaurant we
stand at the base of the disputed hill. At the top we can
glimpse the dark, masked figures of the Mohawk guards
standing beneath the lazily flapping flag of the Mohawk
nation. When I move to step beyond the curb and the yellow
plastic police line, a Quebec policeman waves me back.
   "This," says Mr. Beaulne, "must be what it feels like to
live in Lebanon." He stands with his arm around his wife on
the front steps of the empty restaurant, and as I turn to
leave I wonder when I will be able to return for the simple
pleasures of a meal at L'Auberge Clementine.

   Ed.: Since Ms. Jennings's visit to Oka earlier this month,
the Quebec government has called in 3,000 Canadian soldiers
with tanks and armored personnel carriers. They now are in
position around Oka and the other disputed locations. On
Tuesday the army was given orders to take down the
barricades. Frantic last-minute negotiations now are under
way to settle matters peacefully. As of last night, the
barricades at Oka still stood, although a barricade blocking
a major commuter bridge into Montreal was dismantled withput
violence yesterday.
