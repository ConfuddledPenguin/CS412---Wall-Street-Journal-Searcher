   NEW YORK -- When will Wall Street stop beating Sallie Mae
stock?
   Until a few weeks ago, the Student Loan Marketing
Association, or Sallie Mae, was the darling of portfolio
managers, a financial growth stock with a triple-A credit
rating. Propelled by earnings increases of more than 20% a
year and the market's enthusiasm for growth stocks, Sallie
Mae shares rose from around 30 each in early 1988 to a peak
of 56 1/2 on July 17.

   But less than a week later, this newspaper reported
deepening financial difficulties at the Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, a privately run firm that had become
the largest student-loan guarantee agency in the nation.
   Fearing that Sallie Mae might face losses from HEAF's
woes, portfolio managers dumped the stock. Sallie Mae shares
were trading in the mid-40s within days, and sank as low as
34 3/4 in last week's stock-market rout. Based on yesterday's
closing price of 41 5/8, investors have trimmed nearly $1.5
billion from Sallie Mae's market value in less than six
weeks.
   Several Wall Street analysts who follow Sallie Mae believe
the company won't suffer any losses from HEAF's troubles and
that the market has punished Sallie Mae far more than it
deserves. These analysts are pounding the table to try to
lure portfolio managers back into the stock.
   "Sallie Mae is one of the strongest financial institutions
in the United States," says John E. Keefe, an analyst with
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, who believes Sallie Mae's stock price
will head back toward 50 by the end of the year. At the heart
of Mr. Keefe's recommendation is his belief that whatever
happens to HEAF, the Department of Education won't allow
Sallie Mae or other holders of student loans to suffer a
loss.
   Eric I. Hemel, a First Boston analyst, takes a similar
view and expresses it with a lack of equivocation unusual on
Wall Street. "We see zero, and we mean zero, HEAF-related
losses at Sallie Mae," Mr. Hemel declared in a report this
month on Sallie Mae. Mr. Hemel and others, including Sallie
Mae executives, argue that the government can't allow lenders
to take losses on student loans as a result of HEAF's
problems, because lenders will then stop making new loans and
the program will grind to a halt.
   Sallie Mae buys government-guaranteed student loans from
banks and thrifts and earns a spread between the interest
paid on loans and its cost of borrowing. HEAF is an
intermediary between holders of student loans, such as Sallie
Mae, and the Department of Education.
   If a borrower defaults, the loan holder seeks payment from
a guarantee agency such as HEAF, which submits a claim for
reimbursement to the government. If too many of an agency's
guaranteed loans default in one fiscal year, the government
cuts its reimbursement to 90% and then to 80%. HEAF, which
guaranteed many trade-school loans, is now in the 80%
category.
   Lawrence A. Hough, Sallie Mae's recently appointed
president and chief executive officer, said in an interview
that Sallie Mae owns about $2.5 billion of HEAF-guaranteed
student loans, and has loans and loan commitments totaling $1
billion to HEAF and its affiliates. All the loans are backed
by more than enough collateral in the form of cash, student
loans or receivables from the government, Mr. Hough said. He
believes the government will make sure Sallie Mae and other
loan holders get 100% reimbursement on their HEAF-guaranteed
loans. But even if that doesn't happen, Mr. Hough says Sallie
Mae's maximum pretax loss would total between $30 million and
$50 million, spread over three or four years.
   A concern of analyst Lacy M. Shockley at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, who isn't recommending Sallie Mae, is that the
company may have to get into the loan-guarantee business
itself to help resolve HEAF's problems. Though Sallie Mae
once proposed taking on some guarantee business, Mr. Hough
said that proposal was withdrawn and that Sallie Mae won't
become a guarantor unless it can be done with "the same
virtually zero-risk characteristic that describes our normal
business."
   Sallie Mae's shares are being hurt, in part, because the
resolution of HEAF's troubles and the future size of the
studentloan program are political issues unfamiliar to Wall
Street. "When political questions enter the valuation
equation, many investors just don't want to take the time and
they head elsewhere," Mr. Keefe says. "For years, Sallie Mae
has been a 90-second story. Now it takes three minutes. In a
difficult market, the portfolio manager just doesn't have
that much patience."
