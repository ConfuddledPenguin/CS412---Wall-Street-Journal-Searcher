   WASHINGTON -- The financial troubles at the Small Business
Administration's venture-capital program are intensifying and
are likely to worsen if the economy deteriorates, top
lawmakers and officials say. But the program, which has
helped finance thousands of small businesses over the past
three decades, will almost certainly survive the crisis,
these experts believe.
   The SBA program licenses small business investment
companies, or SBICs, to provide government-guaranteed loans
and equity financing for small companies. For the immediate
future, it faces a period of retrenchment as lawmakers and
government officials try to piece together what led to a
string of failures of SBICs.

   The SBA ordered a moratorium on granting new SBIC licenses
in June, and auditors from its inspector general's office
just completed an exhaustive scrutiny of the books at about
20 of them. At the same time, the SBA has asked the Justice
Department to decide whether to sue the directors of the
largest failed SBIC, River Capital Corp. of Springfield, Va.
   An SBA study shows potential SBIC losses of more than $800
million. (SBICs currently hold $1.4 billion in leveraged
federal funds.) Sen. Dale Bumpers, chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee that recently completed hearings on
the program's troubles, calls the SBIC insolvencies "a
mini-savings and loan" crisis. "It's hard for me to have
faith in a program that could possibly lose half of the money
it's borrowed," the Arkansas Democrat says.
   A combination of factors contributed to the mess.
Officials lay much of the blame on lax regulation by the SBA
and poor management by some investment companies. The
procedures under which the companies operate also have come
under criticism. To be licensed as an SBIC, investors need $1
million in private capital. They can then borrow as much as
four times that amount from the agency, and can renew their
debentures or loan commitments. The result, say some experts,
can be continuous, rolling loans that last until a company's
investments run into trouble.
   In addition to all this, the risk inherent in financing
small, growth-oriented enterprises increases as U.S. economic
growth slows. The fragile economy could mean more problems,
Sen. Bumpers believes. So far this year, about 25 companies
have gone into liquidation, double the program's annual
average. A recession could mean a tripling or quadrupling of
liquidations, the senator predicts.
   Although the inspector general's office hasn't released
results of its review, the consensus on Capitol Hill and in
industry circles is that the program's past successes will
guarantee continuing congressional approval. SBICs provided
the start-up money for the likes of Apple Computer Inc. and
Federal Express Corp. Sen. Bumpers says they have generated
enough tax revenues to more than cover the cost of all the
SBA's losses.
   He and other committee members praised SBA Administrator
Susan Engeleiter for swift damage-control action, including
replacing the program's director and toughening the
accounting practices of investment-company auditors.
   The SBA has also been active in following up the 1988
River Capital failure, which will cost the government about
$29 million. In addition to asking the Justice Department to
decide whether to sue the company's directors, SBA general
counsel Sally Narey says, it asked the department to
determine whether charges should be brought against Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co., the accounting firm that was under contract
to review River Capital's records and investment procedures.
   The SBA contends that Arthur Andersen should have looked
more deeply into whether River Capital's managers were
correctly valuing its investments, while the accounting firm
maintains it performed its role properly. In a review of the
case, the General Accounting Office didn't blame Arthur
Andersen for the company's failure but strongly recommended
the use of government auditing standards for investment
concerns.
   During the recent Senate hearings, SBA officials and other
witnesses blamed poor management decisions by the investment
companies and inadequate regulation by the agency for the
current crisis. One of River Capital's main investments, for
example, was a hazardous waste disposal company in Rhode
Island that never won a state permit.
   Until recently, the SBA had only five staffers handling
SBIC liquidations; they were responsible for a caseload that
experts say would have required 50 people by private industry
standards. The failure of another SBIC, Royal Business Funds
Inc. of New York, left the SBA saddled with a Colorado ski
resort that agency officials operated for several years at a
loss of $11 million. This month, First Connecticut Small
Business Investment Co. of Bridgeport went into bankruptcy
proceedings owing the SBA about $28 million.
   Currently, 159 SBICs are in liquidation proceedings, owing
Uncle Sam about $476 million, the SBA says. The agency says
it expects to collect about half of the sum, which doesn't
include interest owed on the money. So far this year, the
agency has collected $66 million from the assets of failed
investment companies. And an earlier review by the inspector
general's office found that the SBA risks losing another $130
million from still-operating SBICs with a high risk of
failing.
   Representatives of the SBIC industry say the negative
publicity resulting from the hearings and the moratorium on
new licensing has been unfair.
   "We hope the hearings and the spotlight on the business
failures will be a cleansing experience," says Peter McNeish,
president of the National Association of Small Business
Investment Companies.
   Some venture capitalists also believe indictments of the
program have been overblown. Jim Parsons, a general partner
with RFE Investment Partners, New Canaan, Conn., says while
there have been "problems in the industry, this is a pretty
risky means of investment. I think on balance, the program
has been a real benefit to the economy."
   JoAnn Price, president of the National Association of
Investment Companies that represents minority-owned SBICs,
often called Mesbics, worries that the negative publicity
will hurt efforts to expand private capital available to
those companies. Congressional aides and others familiar with
the industry say Mesbics have had far fewer problems than
SBICs in general.
   This is a critical time for small business, which faces a
dearth of start-up financing. Venture firms have been moving
away from high-risk financing of small and early-stage
companies to larger, more established ones. Many venture
capitalists believe if funds continue to dry up for start-ups
in the 1990s, SBICs will be relied on more than they are
today.
