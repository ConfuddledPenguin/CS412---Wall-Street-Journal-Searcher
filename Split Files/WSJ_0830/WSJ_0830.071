   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc., a
brokerage firm, said its chairman and chief executive
officer, J. Craighill Redwine, resigned.
   Mr. Redwine, 49 years old, was named chief executive in
1986. In an interview, he said that he had decided "it was
time to move on" from his posts, and that there wasn't any
pressure to leave the firm. He said that he probably will
remain in the brokerage industry, but that he doesn't have
any immediate plans.

   Interstate/Johnson, one of the largest brokerage firms in
the Southeast, has had several quarters of declining revenue
and widening losses. In the quarter ended June 30, the
company had a loss of $1.4 million, or 20 cents a share, on
revenue of $31.9 million. The loss included a $750,000 charge
related to litigation.
   Elmon L. Vernier Jr., president and chief operating
officer, said Interstate/Johnson's board decided to leave Mr.
Redwine's posts vacant temporarily. The company, Mr. Vernier
said, is reviewing its businesses and options to develop a
"strategic direction."
