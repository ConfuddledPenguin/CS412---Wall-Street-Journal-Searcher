   WASHINGTON -- The Mideast crisis will probably force a
closer look at the cost of the clean air bill -- the biggest
energy legislation around -- but the measure isn't expected
to change much.
   The jump in oil prices and increased likelihood of
recession in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait have
given new ammunition to White House and industry lobbyists
who have attacked the bill's steep price tag. "This sobering
Middle East crisis should cause everyone to re-evaluate
America's energy priorities and should raise grave concerns
about the new Clean Air Act," said Richard Seibert, vice
president for resources and environment at the National
Association of Manufacturers.

   The Bush administration estimates that the legislation
would impose annual costs of $25 billion on industry when it
is fully phased in, with utilities and oil refiners -- and
their customers -- among the hardest hit. The measure, which
is pending in a House-Senate conference committee, would
impose the nation's first controls on acid rain, curb
cancer-causing emissions from factories and take a new
approach to cleaning up smog in all U.S. cities by 2010.
   At the same time, however, powerful forces stand in the
way of any effort to make wholesale changes in the measure.
An attempt to substantively alter the measure would risk
unraveling the series of carefully crafted compromises that
was worked out over more than a year of negotiation. With
enactment -- and the congressional elections -- in sight, few
lawmakers are likely to be willing to take that risk.
   Furthermore, the strength of the environmental movement
remains a strong counterweight to any new push by business or
the White House to scale back the measure on cost or any
other grounds. "The people who have argued against clean air
for a long time will use this recession argument against it
now," said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "But
with the deadlines in this bill, there will be plenty of time
for business to comply long after any recession is just a
memory."
   Most important, the impact of the Mideast instability is
blunted because it can support many sides in the debate.
Besides bolstering arguments for limiting the clean air
bill's costs, it also helps people who want to use the
measure to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
Sometimes the two goals are at odds.
   For example, both the Senate and House measures would
force the oil industry to begin selling cleaner-burning
reformulated gasoline in some cities. The industry has
contended that the provisions would force them to close
refineries temporarily and could boost the price of gasoline
as much as 15 cents a gallon in those cities. Both effects
would be particularly undesirable at a time when the economy
is weak and gasoline prices are rising.
   Over the longer term, though, replacement of gasoline with
non-gasoline additives -- as the provisions would require --
could help reduce oil imports. Higher gasoline prices would
promote conservation.
   Still, fears about the economy may well make a difference
in the clean air debate, at least at the margins. They could
help bolster the less costly provision in areas, such as
provisions designed to reduce industrial smog emissions,
where one house's bill is more stringent than the other.
Industry also may be able to use the crisis to help push back
effective dates, such as deadlines for cleaning up auto
tailpipe emissions.
   In addition, the Mideast crisis may boost small business's
efforts to win a softening of provisions that would impose
additional requirements for permits and paperwork. For
energy-intensive small businesses, "it's almost a double
whammy with clean air kicking in and the Iraqi situation,"
said Terry Hill, a spokesman for the National Federation of
Independent Business.
