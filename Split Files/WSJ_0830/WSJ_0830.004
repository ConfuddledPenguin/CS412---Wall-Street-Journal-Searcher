   Yields on taxable money-market mutual funds resumed their
slide in the week ended Tuesday, and investment inflows
slowed markedly.
   The average seven-day compound yield of 433 taxable funds
slipped to 7.76% from 7.80%, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. The annual yield had increased
fractionally in the previous week after declining since early
July. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.

   After pouring several billion dollars a week into money
funds for three weeks, investors added just $475.4 million to
the taxable funds in the latest week, the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter reported. The total now stands at $400.9 billion,
by Donoghue's count.
   "Recent optimism about the Mideast crisis has reduced the
turmoil in the stock and bond markets," said Martha
Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's, explaining the small
increase. She noted that institutional investors took about
$528 million out of taxable funds, meaning that individuals
added a total of about $1 billion.
   Institutional investors typically take cash out of money
funds when yields on competing investments look better. Stock
prices, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have
risen somewhat in the past few days, and yields on Treasury
bills sold at auction have moved slightly higher in the past
two weeks.
   Yields on taxable money funds are unlikely to change much
any time soon. The average maturity of the funds' investments
-- such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate
IOUs), bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills --
remained at a fairly long 45 days for the fourth consecutive
week.
   Yields on tax-free funds rose in the week ended Tuesday.
The average seven-day compound yield increased to 5.34% from
5.26%. The latest yield is equivalent to 7.42% for an
investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.97% for someone paying
33% in taxes.
   Assets of the 229 tax-exempt funds tracked by Donoghue's
declined $392.6 million, to $80.7 billion. Average maturity
lengthened two days, to 55 days.
