   Preliminary census figures are beginning to confirm the
belief that the centers of political power have tipped.
Altogether, California, Texas and Florida may pick up 14
congressional seats, while New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts lose ground. We pick the latter three because
each is in the process of significantly raising taxes to
cover public outlays that they won't reduce. It is an
interesting spectacle to watch the political culture of these
prominent states operate in apparent obliviousness to
potential losses both of fleeing residents and of political
importance.
