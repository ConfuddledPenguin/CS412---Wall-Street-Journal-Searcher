   General Development Corp., the beleaguered real-estate
company, introduced a plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami
to reassure its customers and to stabilize its own
operations.
   The Miami-based company, which filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in April, said the plan includes, among other
measures, financial incentives for buyers of the company's
home sites to continue making payments, and a lot-transfer
program, under which customers with contracts for home sites
that are currently undeveloped would be transferred to a
comparable developed one.

   General Development said company surveys have shown that
the top priority among its home-site buyers is assurance that
they will receive a deed to a developed home site. About 21%
of the company's customers made their July home-site payment.
But if customers received assurances of obtaining a deed and
financial incentives, the survey indicated, then about 63% of
customers would continue making payments.
   General Development's president, Thomas J. Hutchison,
characterized the program as the "first major step in
establishing a reorganization plan which will allow General
Development to emerge from bankruptcy."
