   ATLANTA -- Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. and Sovran Financial
Corp. named top executives to manage the two banking
companies when they merge.
   The merger, announced last year, is expected to be
completed Saturday. It will create the nation's 13th-largest
bank holding company, based on its more than 1,000 offices in
seven states and about $50.3 billion in assets. The newly
created company will be named C&amp;S/Sovran Corp., but local
banks will continue to operate under their current names. The
new company will have dual headquarters in Atlanta and
Norfolk, Va.
