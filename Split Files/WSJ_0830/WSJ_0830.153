   Fujitsu Ltd. said it has made various enhancements to its
VP2000 series supercomputers, including the introduction of
two new models.
   The new systems, the VP2400/40 and VP2200/40, provide
improved high-speed program processing, the Japanese company
said.

   The systems will be available in September 1991, with a
monthly rental fee of about 79 million yen ($550,156) for the
VP2200/40 and of about 103 million yen for the VP2400/40.
   The other enhancements are intended to respond to
increased user demands for large-scale program processing
involving simulations, Fujitsu said.
   In a separate announcement, Fujitsu disclosed the release
of the UXP/M operating system for the VP2000 series
supercomputers and M series of mainframes, the first
mainframe computer adaptation of Unix System V Release 4. The
SVR4 is the latest standard for the Unix operating system.
   Fujitsu said it plans to adopt the Unix SVR4 standard for
all its Unix products.
   Basic software for UXP/M is scheduled to be delivered next
April, with a monthly rental fee beginning at 210,000 yen.
