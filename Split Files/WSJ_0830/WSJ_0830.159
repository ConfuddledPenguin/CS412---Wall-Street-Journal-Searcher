   James River Corp. posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of
$84.8 million, or $1.11 a share, after taking a charge of
about $143.6 million, or $1.76 a share, to restructure its
operations.
   In the year-ago quarter, the paper-products maker had
profit of $57 million, or 64 cents a share, including
one-time items that resulted in a net gain of $800,000, or
one cent a share.

   James River announced the reorganization plan earlier this
month, and the loss for the first quarter, which ended July
29, was generally in line with analysts' expectations. As
part of the plan, the company intends to sell or shut down
operations with sales of $1.3 billion.
   The Richmond, Va., company said revenue for the quarter
was $1.42 billion, compared with $1.48 billion in the
year-ago period.
   James River said earnings dropped in its communications
papers division due to continued low prices for uncoated
freesheet papers, but its towel and tissue division posted a
"significant" increase in earnings.
   The company's specialty papers division also posted an
earnings gain. James River has agreed to sell 80% of the
division to a new company controlled by AEA Investors Inc.
and a management group.
