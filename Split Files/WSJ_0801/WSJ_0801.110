   Cambridge Capital Fund Limited Partnership, a New York
investment company, said it doesn't believe it can structure
a purchase of Whitehall Corp., a Dallas-based defense
contractor, that would be "economically justifiable" and
still be acceptable to Whitehall's shareholders.
   Cambridge earlier this year attempted to acquire
Whitehall, proposing to acquire the 90.4% that it didn't own
at the time for about $20 a share. But Cambridge lost a proxy
battle to place five directors of its choosing on the
Whitehall board in April. The investment firm then withdrew
its offer to buy the company, but said it would continue to
explore alternatives.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Cambridge said it reached its conclusion following the recent
loss of business at Whitehall's Aero subsidiary in Florida
and the resignation of Whitehall's chief financial officer.
   Cambridge said it believes "a substantial redirection" of
Whitehall's business strategy is needed to "halt the erosion
of value of the stockholders' investment." Officials at
Whitehall didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Whitehall shares closed at $12, down 50 cents.
