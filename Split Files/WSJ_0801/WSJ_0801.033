   In 1927, a steel mogul and socialite named Eben MacBurney
Byers tumbled from the top berth of his private Pullman
compartment en route home to New York from the Harvard-Yale
football game. He was apparently engaged in some vigorous
post-game revelry at the time.
   What happened next led ultimately to his gruesome death 4
1/2 years later -- and to his place as a central character in
a bizarre episode in U.S. medicine.

   The saga of Mr. Byers is the subject of a report in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association. While it
has timely implications for contemporary medicine, it also
provides an evocative look at a period in medicine before
regulators and lawyers spoiled the fun.
   "Byers was the personification of the Roaring '20s," says
Roger M. Macklis, principal author of the report and a
radiation oncologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston and the Harvard Joint Center for Radiation Therapy.
"He was into everything."
   The chairman of A.M. Byers Steel Co. and a director of
Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing, Mr. Byers was also a
U.S. amateur golf champion, a horse racing enthusiast and, by
reputation, an ardent ladies' man.
   Dr. Macklis's interest in Mr. Byers was provoked in part
by the doctor's acquisition late in 1989 of four mostly empty
bottles of a patent medicine called Radithor. It was a status
drink: At $1 a bottle, only the well-to-do could easily
afford it. And it was a health drink -- marketed by an
entrepreneur named William J.A. Bailey, it promised to cure
more than 150 maladies.
   Mostly, Mr. Bailey sold it as an aphrodisiac. "Improved
blood supply sent to the pelvic organs and tonic effects upon
the nervous system generally result in a great improvement in
the sex organs," touted a pamphlet entitled "Radithor, the
New Weapon of Medical Science," which was mailed to doctors
in the mid-1920s.
   Radithor's magic ingredient was radium. The concoction
rode the crest of the Mild Radium Therapy movement, a
phenomenon in U.S. social circles shortly after the Curies
discovered radium at the turn of the century. It was based on
the premise that radiation, taken in minute doses, provided a
metabolic kick to the body's endocrine system and infused
depleted organs with energy.
   Dr. Macklis says Mr. Bailey "was a born con man" who had
been peddling various miracle cures, especially for
impotence, for years. But none achieved the success of
Radithor, an over-the-counter tonic he asserted was the
result of years of laboratory research, but which was really
just distilled water laced with one microcurie each of two
isotopes of radium.
   He sold more than 400,000 bottles for $1 each -- a 400%
profit, says Dr. Macklis, adding: "He was the chief
impresario in the radioactive patent medicine field."
   Mr. Byers was 47 when he fell out of the berth and injured
his arm. Over the next several weeks, he complained of
muscular aches and a run-down feeling that undermined his
performance both athletic and, it was rumored, sexual, Dr.
Macklis reports. A Pittsburgh physiotherapist recommended
Radithor.
   For the next two years, Mr. Byers gulped two or three
bottles a day. His activities while under its influence
aren't well documented. But initially, he was apparently so
satisfied with the results that he sent cases of it to
business partners and girlfriends, and even fed it to his
race horses.
   The science of the day gave at least a measure of support
to Mr. Byers's faith in radium water. And U.S. regulatory
agencies at the time were more concerned about truth in
advertising than about potential harmful effects. The Federal
Trade Commission, for instance, took action against makers of
potions that lacked advertised levels of radioactivity.
   Over two years, Mr. Byers guzzled perhaps 1,400 half-ounce
bottles of the potion, Dr. Macklis says. He finally quit in
October 1930, complaining to his doctor then that he'd lost
"that toned-up feeling." He began to lose weight and
experience headaches; many of his teeth fell out.
   By 1930, the FTC had begun to raise questions about
another advertised claim of radium-water medicines: that they
were harmless. It asked Mr. Byers to testify at hearings in
1931, but by then he was too sick. An agency lawyer
dispatched to take his statement at his mansion on Long
Island was aghast.
   Mr. Byers's "whole upper jaw, excepting two front teeth,
and most of his lower jaw had been removed," the lawyer
reported. "All the remaining bone tissue of his body was
disintegrating, and holes were actually forming in his
skull."
   By the end of the year, the FTC ordered Mr. Bailey's
operations closed. And on March 31, 1932, Mr. Byers died in a
New York City hospital. He was 51. The next day, a front-page
headline in the New York Times proclaimed the medical
examiner's initial autopsy findings: Mr. Byers died of radium
poisoning.
   The news alarmed some members of the upper class, although
James J. Walker, then mayor of New York City and an avowed
user of radium water, at first resisted warnings to stop. In
Pittsburgh, there were whispers in the press that a lady
friend of Mr. Byers had also died of a mysterious ailment.
Health officials in some cities ordered store shelves cleared
of such potions. And some doctors stepped forward with
evidence of other cases. A doctor went on a New York radio
program and held radioactive bones of one victim in front of
a Geiger counter to demonstrate "the deadly sound of radium,"
Dr. Macklis says.
   Dr. Macklis bought his bottles of Radithor from a dealer
in medical antiques; he's not saying how much he paid. Then
he and two colleagues at the Harvard Joint Center, Marc R.
Bellerive and John L. Humm, conducted a radiochemical
analysis of the Radithor. It confirmed that Radithor was
laced with significant amounts of radium isotopes.
   Using a complex computer program, the scientists
reconstructed the radium's life cycle through dozens of
generations as it decayed to form new isotopes, and
calculated the level of Mr. Byers's exposure. "He took enough
radium to kill four people if he took it all at once," Dr.
Macklis says. "The mystery is how did Byers survive so long,
feeling so good, and have such a super-lethal burden in his
body?"
   He speculates that despite Mr. Byers's macabre demise, it
is possible that chronic, low-level doses of powerful "alpha"
radiation really do have at least a temporary stimulative
effect, probably by provoking a defensive response that
triggers production of fresh blood cells within the bone
marrow.
   Dr. Macklis and his colleagues also believe if alpha
radiation could be safely harnessed, it could become a
precise medical weapon that would attack cancerous cells
without damaging nearby healthy tissue. Two years ago, Dr.
Macklis succeeded in accomplishing that in mice.
   It was his search for information on the impact of alpha
radiation on people that led Dr. Macklis to the lost story of
Mr. Byers, which he pieced together from medical literature,
press accounts and historical documents.
   In the end, Mr. Byers's death caused the collapse of the
radioactive patent medicine industry. But all along, Mr.
Bailey insisted that his potion was safe. After all, he said,
he had probably drunk more Radithor than anyone else, and he
felt fine.
   Nearly 20 years after Mr. Bailey's death in 1949 of
bladder cancer, medical researchers exhumed his remains. They
had been ravaged by radiation. They were still "hot" when
pulled from the ground.
