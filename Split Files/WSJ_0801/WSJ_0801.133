   NEW YORK -- Oppenheimer Management Corp.'s top executives
have apparently teamed up with Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co. to purchase Oppenheimer Management, a $14
billion fund company, from British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings
PLC.
   Oppenheimer Management's president, Jon Fossel, declined
to comment on the report, which first appeared in Investment
Management Weekly, a Boston newsletter. Mr. Fossel did,
however, say he expected to make an announcement on the sale
this morning.

   British &amp; Commonwealth, a U.K. financial-services group,
purchased Oppenheimer from another British firm, Mercantile
Holdings, shortly before the 1987 stock-market crash. But in
early June, British &amp; Commonwealth entered "administration,"
the U.K. equivalent of the U.S.'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings, and it is now looking to sell Oppenheimer and
other assets to reduce its $2 billion of debt. Oppenheimer
Management isn't related to Oppenheimer &amp; Co., the U.S.
brokerage firm.
   Springfield, Mass.-based MassMutual, the U.S.'s 11th
largest life insurance company, manages and distributes
MassMutual Integrity Funds, a group of mutual funds that were
launched in 1988 and have more than $350 million in assets.
MassMutual's agents sell both the firm's own mutual funds and
those of other fund companies, including Oppenheimer's.
