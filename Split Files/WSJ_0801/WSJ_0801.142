   ATLANTA -- Georgia Power Co. said it agreed in principle
to sell one of its coal-fired power plants in a transaction
valued at about $810 million over four years.
   The company, a subsidiary of Southern Co., said it plans
to sell unit No. 4 of its Scherer electric generating plant
in Forysth, Ga., to Florida Power &amp; Light Co. and
Jacksonville Electric Authority. The sale will be made in
stages during the years 1991 through 1995. Florida Power &amp;
Light, a unit of FPL Group Inc. in North Palm Beach, Fla.,
would eventually own 76% of the 846-megawatt unit;
Jacksonville Electric Authority would own the remainder.

   Georgia Power said the first part of the sale, totaling
about $300 million, is expected to be completed in the first
six months of 1991. The entire transaction is subject to
negotiation of final agreements and regulatory approvals.
   James L. Broadhead, chairman and chief executive officer
of Florida Power &amp; Light, said the move will fulfill a
significant portion of the utility's need for additional
generating capacity.
   Georgia Power said it hasn't determined how it will use
proceeds from the proposed sales, but added that one
alternative is a special redemption at par of outstanding
first mortgage bonds.
   Unit No. 4 of the Scherer facility was completed in 1989.
Units Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are owned jointly by Georgia Power,
Oglethorpe Power Corp., the Municipal Electric Authority of
Georgia, Gulf Power Co. and the city of Dalton, Ga.
