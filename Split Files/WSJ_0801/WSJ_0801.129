   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government is opposed to Varity
Corp.'s plan to reincorporate in the U.S., said a senior
official of Canada's Department of Industry, Science and
Technology.
   William Terry, director of machinery in the department,
said Varity undertook to maintain its head office in Ontario
and to remain a Canadian corporation in a 1986 agreement with
the federal government and the province of Ontario. As part
of that agreement, the two governments invested 200 million
Canadian dollars (US$173.5 million) in Varity to help it
stave off bankruptcy-law proceedings.

   Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of
Varity, told the company's annual meeting Monday that he
plans to seek shareholder approval to reincorporate the
industrial concern as a Delaware corporation and
simultaneously conduct a 1-for-10 share consolidation. He
said after the meeting that the company's legal advisers
believe that a move to the U.S. doesn't violate any covenants
with the government.
   "We expect Varity to live up to {its} legal obligation" to
remain a Canadian concern, Mr. Terry said. He said Canadian
government officials have met with Varity executives to
discuss the planned move, but that the talks haven't changed
the government's position.
   If Varity proceeds with the plan, Mr. Terry said the
government "would have to consider the full range of
alternatives open to us."
   One alternative could be to vote against the proposal at a
shareholders meeting. After injecting capital into Varity,
the provincial and federal governments received all the Class
II preferred shares of Varity. According to Varity officials,
the reincorporation and share-consolidation measures require
approval of at least two-thirds of each class of shares.
   Mr. Rice, of Varity, has said that it would be difficult
for the company to implement a share consolidation as a
Canadian corporation. Under Toronto Stock Exchange
regulations, a company conducting a share consolidation must
change its name. Mr. Rice said that isn't very feasible for
Varity, which changed its name from Massey-Ferguson four
years ago.
   A spokesman for the Toronto Stock Exchange said an
exemption from the regulation can be granted to a
non-Canadian company when most of its shares are traded on
foreign exchanges.
