   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- The stakes couldn't be higher for
Chrysler Corp.
   With its car sales slumping, the continued success of
Chrysler's minivans is the keystone to its future. Yet
stronger competitors, General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor
Corp., have unleashed sleeker, more modern minivans in the
past year.

   Now Chrysler is answering by revamping its minivans for
the first time since it popularized the "people mover" market
seven years ago. The changes are significant, but subtle.
   Chrysler is betting that a slightly sleeker body combined
with lots of interior refinements -- more convenient
switches, "sweat-proof" seats, added cup holders and even
juice-box holders for kids -- will be just what buyers want
and will continue its dominance of the minivan market. If,
that is, consumers can swallow one change that they are
certain to dislike: a markedly higher price.
   "When you're dealing with the crown jewels of the
corporation, you don't get too exotic," says Trevor Creed, a
Chrysler designer involved in remodeling the new minivans,
which make their debut next month. Chrysler spent $600
million to redesign its models and retool the plants that
build them. "It was time for a change," Mr. Creed says, "but
not time to completely throw out something that has been
working so well."
   Working well is an understatement. Chrysler's minivans
were the single most successful vehicles of the 1980s. Though
formidable competitors launched their own versions, Chrysler
still accounts for nearly half of U.S. minivan sales. This
dominance has literally kept Chrysler in business.
   Profits from minivans equaled 65% of the company's overall
net income last year after a huge write-off for plant
closings caused by weakening car sales. Industry analysts
estimate Chrysler gets $4,000 in gross profit on each 1990
minivan sold.
   So, Chrysler figures, why mess with success? The 1991
Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country
will be built on the same chassis as previous versions,
meaning they will be no longer or wider than their
predecessors. Interior space will remain the same. And they
will use the same transmissions and engines to achieve the
same horsepower.
   The most significant updates came in the suspension and
interiors of the vans. The suspension is supposed to provide
a ride that is steadier and firmer. Inside, Chrysler put new
"foam-cast" seats that allow the body heat of passengers to
escape, and a new dashboard layout with radio, heater and
air-conditioning switches within closer reach of the driver.
   The exterior, which Chrysler says is 80% new, is more
rounded with a much smaller front grille and a revamped
tailgate. But it still bears such a strong resemblance to the
old shape that it has the same "drag coefficient," a measure
of wind resistance. Chrysler, in short, rejected the
high-styling approach taken by GM and Toyota, because it
believes most minivan buyers are a practical sort.
   Chrysler's changes are so evolutionary, in fact, that the
new minivans won't draw many stares. George C. Peterson,
president of AutoPacific Group Inc., a market research group,
notes that on a recent road test of the minivans, most people
who passed him didn't give the new models a second glance.
Only drivers of older minivans, he says, turned their heads.
   Still, Mr. Peterson says he agrees with Chrysler's
reasoning: "By fixing the ride and the interior, they spent
their money wisely, because these are products sold for their
utility value instead of style."
   Chrysler officials say they designed the 1991 minivans to
address suggestions from current minivan owners instead of
reaching to attract a new group of buyers. The new dashboard
layout was the most asked-for alteration, followed by the
addition of bucket seats and shoulder belts in the second
row. Chrysler designers also added their own innovation:
juice-box holders in the back of the stretched minivans so
kids won't spill the popular containers.
   "We have two million minivan customers out there and we
can't afford to be arrogant" with them, explains Francois
Castaing, Chrysler's vice president of vehicle engineering.
"We have to respond to what they want first."
   One thing minivan buyers aren't likely to want is higher
prices. Chrysler minivans have sold well because prices
remained below most competing models. Chrysler managed to do
that by having far more capacity to build minivans -- up to
500,000 annually -- than other manufacturers.
   But now Chrysler is making some previously optional
equipment -- such as power mirrors and rear-seat shoulder
belts -- standard. Manual transmissions no longer will be
available. Instead, a three-speed automatic becomes standard,
with a four-speed automatic (which boosts pickup and gas
mileage alike) available for extra charge. Chrysler officials
say the new equipment adds more than $1,000 in retail cost to
the vehicles, but consumers may balk.
   Preliminary 1991 prices provided to fleet buyers show
Chrysler is boosting the price of its minivans as much as 12%
from prices set at the start of the 1990 model year. Chrysler
officials maintain the 1991-model prices are only 2% higher,
as adjusted for comparable equipment. Still, as things stand
with the preliminary prices, a base-model 1991 Dodge Grand
Caravan LE will cost $19,300, compared with $18,698 for a
comparable base-priced Toyota Previa LE. That is up from
$18,325 for the base-model 1990 Grand Caravan LE.
   "They're being rather aggressive" with the pricing, says
Harvey Heinbach, auto analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in
New York. "I suspect they have the attitude of erring on the
high side so they can add incentives {e.g. rebates} if
necessary. Even with a terrific product these days, it's hard
to sell without incentives."
   In the past two years, Chrysler's grip on the minivan
market has loosened only slightly with the introduction of
the plastic-skinned APV minivans by GM last summer and
Toyota's egg-shaped Previa last spring. The APVs, expected by
GM officials to mount a serious challenge to Chrysler's
minivans, afford an awkward forward view because of their
steeply sloping noses. Sales have been so disappointing that
GM temporarily idled some assembly workers to cut production.
   The Previa received rave reviews, but is arriving in the
U.S. in limited quantities. What's more, its "mid-engine"
design, in which the engine sits under the front seat, gives
some buyers pause. Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has tried to
belittle the design by quipping: "At Chrysler, we believe
your engine ought to arrive at the scene of an accident
before you do."
   Other minivans also have limitations that have kept them
from clobbering Chrysler. Mazda Motor Corp.'s MPV has a
superior finish, engine and transmission, say car magazines,
but is smaller than Chrysler's minivans. Ford Motor Co.'s
Aerostar has been the second-best selling minivan to
Chrysler's, but has more of a truck-like feel and features
rear-wheel drive to Chrysler's front-wheel drive. (Both the
Ford and Chrysler vans, as well as those made by Toyota and
Mazda, also come in all-wheel-drive versions. So do GM's
older models, the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari.)
   But Chrysler officials say they expect Ford to bring out
by 1994 two new minivans -- a replacement for the Aerostar
and a van built in a joint venture with Nissan Motor Co. --
that will come much closer to their own. In the meantime,
they are hoping the refinements in the 1991 models will
satisfy customers until they come out with an all-new minivan
in 1995.
   "We've been fortunate nobody has decided to just copy our
formula," says John E. Herlitz, director of exterior design
for Chrysler. "Everybody's been happy so far to nibble around
the edges to find their own niche instead of hitting us head
on."
