   LOS ANGELES -- Telecredit Inc., which in June agreed to
merge with Equifax Inc., said terms of the merger pact
require it to reduce its dividend payable in September to 25
cents a share from the 30 cents paid in June.
   As reported, Los Angeles-based Telecredit, which provides
credit verification and debit-card processing services,
agreed to merge with Equifax through a stock swap valued at
about $580 million. Equifax, based in Atlanta, is a major
provider of credit reports for retailers, banks and insurers.

   The new dividend is payable Sept. 7 to stock of record
Aug. 15. The cut represents an about-face from the previous
quarter's five-cent boost to 30 cents.
   Lee A. Ault III, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company's merger agreement also calls for Telecredit
to redeem the company's so-called poison pill for five cents
per right attached to each share. The redemption is to take
place shortly before the merger, which is expected sometime
this fall. The total per-share payout over a period of time
thus would total 30 cents.
   Mr. Ault said that, should the merger not proceed,
Telecredit's board would resume payment at a rate of 30 cents
a share. Asked if there was any reason to believe that the
merger might not occur, Telecredit's executive said "nothing
is over until it's over."
   Telecredit stock yesterday fell 12.5 cents to $47.75 in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Equifax stock climbed 25 cents to $18.625 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
