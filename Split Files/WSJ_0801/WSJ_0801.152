   VIENNA -- Communist Albania announced it will permit
foreign investment and joint ventures. It also decreed
limited freedom to stage public demonstrations.
   The new economic measures decreed by the Tirana leadership
appeared designed to alleviate economic backwardness, provide
technical know-how, improve living conditions and circumvent
a ban on foreign credits.

   The decrees were approved by the presidium of the People's
Assembly and reported by the state news agency ATA only weeks
after some 5,000 Albanians, holed up in foreign embassies,
were allowed to emigrate from Albania, the poorest country in
Europe and a lone stronghold of Stalinism.
   "Foreign embassies, firms or individuals or Albanians
residing abroad can make investments or carry out related
economic activities," said a decree issued on "the protection
of foreign investments in the People's Socialist Republic of
Albania."
   While the official announcement didn't specifically
mention joint ventures, it said that in Albania "enterprises
with participation of foreign capital can carry out their
economic activity in various sectors of the economy."
