   DOMINGUEZ, Calif. -- Pic 'N' Save Corp., embroiled in a
proxy fight with Girard Partners L.P., unveiled a plan to cut
costs and resume a stock buy-back program in an effort to
placate shareholders.
   The company also announced the resignation of its
chairman, president and chief executive officer, Lewis
Merrifield III, who had been under fire.

   The plan includes immediate resumption of the discount
retailer's $60 million program to repurchase its shares in
the open market and a schedule of cost cuts. Capital
expenditures and general and administrative expenses will be
slashed and unprofitable operations curtailed, the company
said.
   "The message from our stockholders that they wanted an
immediate increase in shareholder value was not lost on the
board or the management of the company," the board said.
   Mr. Merrifield, 50 years old, chairman, president and
chief executive for the past three years, had attempted to
expand the company by opening more stores. But he came under
sharp criticism from shareholders for increasing expenses and
a 34% decline in 1989 earnings even though sales increased
18%.
   In April, Girard Partners, an investor group controlled by
David H. Batchelder, announced that it planned to make a bid
for the company, which specializes in close-out merchandise.
But on Monday, Girard said it couldn't come up with the cash
to acquire Pic 'N' Save at a price attractive to
shareholders. The battle had been headed for a climax at the
company's Aug. 29 annual meeting.
   Pic 'N' Save's plans and Mr. Merrifield's resignation
appear to meet most of the demands of the Batchelder group.
Mr. Batchelder didn't respond to a request to comment on Pic
'N' Save's plan.
   Some analysts reacted favorably to the plan, saying they
thought it would get the company back on the track of
earnings growth. "But management has a lot of proving to do,"
said Marcia Koory, analyst at Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith,
Pollan, an Omaha, Neb., brokerage firm. "A lot of big
shareholders have been disenchanted with Mr. Merrifield's
performance."
   Mr. Merrifield will resign effective Jan. 1 as president
and chief executive. Arthur Frankel, 63, former chairman,
president and chief executive of Pic 'N' Save, was elected
chairman. Mr. Merrifield relinquished that title immediately.
The board said it intends to form a search committee to find
a president and chief executive who is a specialist in
merchandising. Mr. Merrifield is an attorney with a
background in corporate law.
   Mr. Merrifield said he had accomplished "most of what I
wanted to" and that his investments and programs were
beginning to achieve their desired results. A specialist in
merchandising would manage the company "in accordance with
its new strategy of maximizing cash flow," he said.
   Pic 'N' Save said that over the past several days it has
been in discussions with Girard Partners to try to find a way
to avoid resumption of a proxy fight but that Girard's
demands were unacceptable to the board. The company said that
despite its efforts for 2 1/2 months, it had received no
satisfactory offers to purchase the company. The board said
it is still willing to speak with interested parties
concerning a sale of the company.
   Under the $60 million share-repurchase program, Pic 'N'
Save said it will immediately begin buying its shares,
subject to market conditions. The company said it also is
"aggressively pursuing prudent senior bank debt borrowing
opportunities in order to increase its repurchase program to
up to $150 million." Pic 'N' Save said it has a "strong
expression of interest" from a financial institution to
provide funds for an increased buy-back.
   The company said its plan includes a 20% reduction in
corporate staff and a continued moderation in the rate of new
store openings. A total of 59 positions and related expenses
are being eliminated from the corporate, store,
administrative and warehousing staffs, the company said. Pic
'N' Save said it plans to open 20 stores this year, 15 fewer
than in 1989. The company plans to open only 10 stores in
1991 and 1992.
   Some analysts who follow the stock advised shareholders to
hold tight through the current unrest. "The story isn't yet
played out," said Ms. Koory, who said she expects further
"maneuvers" by the Batchelder group. Barry Rothberg, analyst
at Mabon Nugent, a New York investment firm, called the moves
"a reasonable course of action which should return the
company to earnings growth in 1991." He said he doesn't see
"much risk" in the stock at the current depressed level. Pic
'N' Save shares closed at $10, down 62.5 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday.
