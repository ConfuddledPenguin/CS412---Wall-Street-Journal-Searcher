   TORONTO -- About 16,000 workers were expected to begin
striking this morning at Canada's two largest steelmakers.
   The walkouts would follow the breakdown of contract talks
between the United Steelworkers of America and officials of
Stelco Inc. and Algoma Steel Corp., a subsidiary of Dofasco
Inc.

   The expected shutdowns come with Canada's steel industry
under pressure from a slowing domestic economy and increased
penetration of the Canadian market by U.S. steel producers.
   Leo Gerard, director of District 6 of the United
Steelworkers, said, "There's no way we can prevent a strike."
He said the union, representing about 10,000 workers at
Toronto-based Stelco, has rejected what the company has
called its final contract offer, which proposed wage
increases of about 2.5% in each year of a three-year pact.
The union is seeking a bigger wage increase and better
protection against inflation for workers and retirees.
   At Algoma, where the union represents about 6,000,
monetary issues haven't been broached, Mr. Gerard said. Talks
with the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, company broke down over
language concerning the contracting-out of work.
   Both companies said an orderly shutdown of operations has
been under way for several days in anticipation of a strike.
Fred Telmer, president of Stelco's steel division, also said
inventory stockpiles have been transferred to customers.
