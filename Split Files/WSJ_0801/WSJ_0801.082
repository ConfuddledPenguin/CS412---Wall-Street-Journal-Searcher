   WASHINGTON -- A former government official said he
regretted the sale of an ailing thrift, in a lucrative
government-assisted deal, to an Arizona insurance executive
who had been indicted for fraud 12 years earlier.
   George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, said that the government staff should have looked
more deeply into the background of James Fail, the insurance
executive. Mr. Barclay said that he was aware of the fraud
indictment at the time of the sale but that by itself it
wasn't enough to disqualify Mr. Fail from bidding. However,
in testimony before a Senate Judiciary subcommitee
investigating government-assisted thrift sales in 1988, Mr.
Barclay admitted that his staff failed to inform senior
officials that an insurance company owned by Mr. Fail was
convicted of fraud as well.

   "If we had the time to work in a more orderly basis,
people like James Fail would not have slipped through the
net," said Mr. Barclay. "Had I known the facts, I would have
objected," he added.
   But Mr. Barclay and other regulators denied that Mr. Fail
was given preferential treatment in the transaction because
of White House ties to Mr. Fail's attorney, Robert Thompson,
a lobbyist. Danny Wall, the former top S&amp;L regulator,
testified yesterday that any hint of political pressure "is
totally absurd."
   The sale of 15 Texas thrifts, which were merged into
Bluebonnet Savings Bank, is the subject of a lengthy inquiry
by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) and a panel of the
Senate Judiciary Committee. The Bluebonnet sale occurred in
an end-of-year rush in 1988, in which dozens of insolvent
thrifts were sold to buyers who reaped billions of dollars in
tax benefits and government assistance in compensation for
the poor thrift investments.
   The Bluebonnet case has attracted particular scrutiny
because Mr. Fail contributed just $1,000 of his own capital
to acquire the S&amp;Ls, while the U.S. pledged $1.8 billion in
assistance.
   Mr. Thompson, under subpoena by the subcommittee, refused
to appear, contending that the committee lacks the authority
to investigate the transaction and that the committee staff
disclosed private financial information to a reporter. Mr.
Thompson's attorney said he would fight the subpoena in
court.
   Sen. Metzenbaum has charged that Mr. Fail was able to win
regulatory approval even though a competing bid would have
cost the government $91 million less. "This all would appear
as though Mr. Thompson had the inside track," said Sen.
Metzenbaum.
   But the former regulators said that the competing bid
flopped on its merits. "It was a novel, cockamamie idea,"
said Stuart Root, former executive director of the thrift
agency. He argued that the competing bid would have
selectively pooled assets and tax breaks of several thrifts
under the supervision of a limited partnership, which isn't
permitted under thrift regulations. "The proposal was not
feasible," said Mr. Root.
   The regulators also defended the 1988 sales, overall,
saying they had little choice but to offer lucrative
long-term assistance in order to attract buyers because the
savings-and-loan insurance fund was low on cash in the short
term. "They weren't brilliant, or strokes of genius, but they
were responsive to the marketplace," said Mr. Wall. "We had
no alternative."
