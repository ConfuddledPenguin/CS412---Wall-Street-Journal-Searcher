   MOSCOW -- Bowing to the inevitable, the government is
officially condoning the dollar-based economy that has
burgeoned in the Soviet Union in the past year.
   Starting today, Soviets will be allowed to spend and save
convertible currency without having to state the source of
their income. The government plans to open a network of
stores that will sell imported and high-quality domestic
goods to individuals and organizations for hard currency.

   The ruble isn't a convertible currency, but the Soviet
Union requires foreigners to pay hard currency for anything
from hotel rooms to utilities according to so-called
"hard-currency ruble" prices. Prices are stated in
hard-currency rubles on anything foreigners might buy, and
payment is made in hard currency.
   The hard-currency ruble doesn't exist in any tangible
form, but the government sets its value at about $1.65. (The
more realistic tourist exchange rate introduced last year is
six rubles to the dollar.)
   The new system marks the reversal of a decades-old policy
under which it has been illegal for Soviets to earn or spend
convertible currency in their own country. Now the government
wants to draw in what it estimates to be hundreds of millions
of dollars of hard currency, and wants it to be spent at
home. To do so, it is tacitly acknowledging that a
hard-currency economy operating in parallel to the ruble
economy has grown rapidly in the past year.
   "It's just the latest case in which the weakness of the
Soviet ruble has been demonstrated," said an article titled
"Ruble, Our Poor Relative," last week in Komsomolskaya
Pravda, the nation's largest circulation daily.
   It still isn't clear exactly how the new system will
operate. For one thing, although the government decree goes
into effect today, it doesn't address the fact that the law
making the holding of foreign currency illegal hasn't been
changed.
   Many economists and bankers oppose the move, fearing it
will undermine the already battered ruble. "I am afraid,"
said Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the U.S.S.R. State
Bank. "It is the wrong move in the long run because people
first of all should be motivated here to use the local
currency."
   For years, only people who had worked overseas, had
foreign relatives, or dared to deal in the black market had
access to hard currency. Those who acquired their dollars
legally could open bank accounts in the Soviet Union, but
could only withdraw money if they presented an exit visa as
proof that they needed the money for travel abroad.
   That system still exists, but control over it has eroded
rapidly in the past several years. The increase in Soviets
traveling overseas and the opening of joint ventures and
cooperative businesses aimed at foreigners in the Soviet
Union has opened the floodgates to hard currency. And as
shops are nearly bare of things to buy for rubles, more
people are demanding payment in dollars, marks or pounds.
