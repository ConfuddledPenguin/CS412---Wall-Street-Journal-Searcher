   MEXICO CITY -- A conglomerate that racked up double-digit
annual sales growth through most of the 1980s should have
international lenders lining up at its door, right? Not if
that company's home office is in Mexico, like that of Grupo
Carso S.A.
   When fast-growing Carso recently began looking for
expansion loans, it discovered that foreign bankers were
still licking their wounds from the Latin lending bloodbath
of the early 1980s. Borrowing in Mexico was hardly more
attractive for Carso. Domestic interest rates, while falling
rapidly, are still well above what the Mexican company's U.S.
competitors pay.

   So in June, Carso made a public offering of $108 million,
the largest in the Mexican stock market, known as the Bolsa
de Valores, since the debt crisis exploded in 1982. It is
only one of a growing number of Mexican firms turning to the
booming stock market and elsewhere for financing.
   Mexico companies are even returning in force to the
Eurobond market, from which they had been largely excluded
for almost a decade. All of the half-dozen or so Mexican
issues announced in the past several months have been small,
creatively designed and attractively priced.
   Cementos Mexicanos S.A., one of the largest cement makers
on the continent, needed money to help finance a recent
acquisition in the U.S. So in June, an affiliate company
issued $100 million in Eurobonds that are convertible to
American depositary receipts in a Cemex unit. Cemex had to
offer a generous 13.5% coupon, but the issue was placed
within two weeks.
   Even some state-owned companies are going to the debt
market, provided they can offer investors the allure of
dollar income. In March, Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., the state
oil monopoly, placed a Eurobond issue of 100 million German
marks. Although the oil giant had to offer an attractive
11.25% coupon to gain acceptance for the bonds, the issue was
a breakthrough: the first Eurobond issue by Pemex since the
oil price collapse of 1982.
   Corporate Mexico's return to debt and equity markets has
been driven both by signs of resurgence in the Mexican
economy and by the government's bold new trade policy. In
1989, Mexico enjoyed its most robust economic growth in
years, 2.9%, double the predicted level.
   Growth this year is shaping up slower, about 2%, but
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has provided an
additional spur to private sector investment. He has said
Mexico would seek a free-trade agreement with the U.S. "When
trade borders are stripped away, only companies large enough
to achieve economies of scale will survive," says Fernando G.
Chico Pardo, a top Carso executive.
   But the high cost of capital for Mexican companies has put
them at a disadvantage as they gird for the showdown with
their northern competitors. As President Salinas's reforms
have picked up steam, interest rates in Mexico have dropped
to about 30%, the lowest since 1982; but they are still
significantly higher than rates U.S. companies pay. Bankers
abroad aren't lining up to sink money into Mexico either, as
evidenced by the recent Bush administration debt-relief
initiative that nearly foundered when bankers hesitated to
ante up new loans.
   All of that has capital-hungry Mexican firms looking
toward the Bolsa for the first time in a long time. Large
public offerings have been infrequent in Mexico. The market
is still small, being capitalized at about $35 billion, and
there is a tradition of keeping shares in a few hands. But
the market's rocketlike surge in the past six quarters has
made public offerings an attractive proposition. "If ever
there was a time to think about an offering, it's right now,"
says Carlos Muriel, international director of Inverlat S.A.,
a big brokerage house.
   The Bolsa's price-earnings ratio had grown to 10.5 by the
end of the second quarter, up from four at the time President
Salinas took office. The Bolsa's growth has been helped by
Mexico's opening to foreign investment that has funneled $600
million into the market since November.
   Carso is just the kind of company that can use the Bolsa
boom to launch its coming-out party. The group was quietly
consolidated during the past decade by Carlos Slim, a
reclusive investor. In many ways Carso retains the low-rent
look of a startup company. The door to Mr. Slim's office has
to be opened gingerly, lest it upset a water cooler parked
just outside. There are only 20 executives in the corporate
staff.
   But appearances are deceiving. The companies under Carso's
umbrella had consolidated revenue last year of more than $1.5
billion, higher than any Mexican private company except the
giant conglomerate Grupo Alfa S.A.
   The group includes everything from Empresas Frisco, a
mining company, to Cigatam, a cigarette producing joint
venture with Philip Morris Products Inc., to Sanborn
Hermanos, a family restaurant chain. Some of the companies
previously were traded on the Bolsa individually, but were
consolidated under the holding company as part of the public
offering. An investment house and insurance firm controlled
by Mr. Slim were spun off from the group at the same time.
The Carso offering, which represents about 13% of the
conglomerate's equity, was snapped up by investors in about
two weeks.
   About the same time Carso went to market, Maseca S.A., a
producer of corn products, and Grupo Gamesa S.A., a maker of
cookies, crackers and other foods, were unveiling offerings
of $39 million and $11 million, respectively.
   Three or four more Mexican companies are nearly ready to
go to market, according to Jose Mantecon, a vice chairman of
the National Stock Commission. "I think this is the direction
more and more companies will be going," says Mr. Mantecon.
