   ROCKVILLE, Md. -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel recommended approval of alpha interferon to treat a
form of chronic viral hepatitis, or liver inflammation.
   A formal approval by the FDA, which is expected to follow
the panel's advice, would make interferon the first
specifically approved treatment for any form of viral
hepatitis.

   It would also clear the way for Schering-Plough Corp. to
market the biotechnology product for a form of the disease
which is formally known as chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis.
About half a million Americans now suffer this form of liver
inflammation, which is spread by tainted blood transfusions,
unclean hypodermic needles and sexual contact. About 150,000
new cases are diagnosed each year, of which half progress to
a state of chronic infection. A virus responsible for about
85% of such cases was recently identified and dubbed
hepatitis C, making antibody testing possible.
   World-wide, the number of cases of the disease is
increasing and has assumed "epidemic" proportions in Japan,
according to Robert J. Spiegel, a Schering vice president of
clinical research.
   Chronic hepatitis sufferers, who are at increased risk of
death from cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer, would be
candidates for alpha interferon treatment under the panel's
recommendation.
   Schering, based in Kenilworth, N.J., said it was
"immensely pleased" by yesterday's action, which virtually
ensures a much broader market for interferon. The drug
previously has been approved for only a few small niches,
mostly in cancer treatment. The action also marks a major
milestone in the evolution of biotechnology industry, where
interferon held the rank of a pioneer, previously consigned
to play a bit part, but now stepping up to fill what may
become a major role.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Schering
closed at $48.875, up 37.5 cents.
   To win the panel's approval, Schering scientists presented
data on more than 300 patients, showing that liver
inflammation subsided in 53% of the patients treated with
alpha interferon, as opposed to 7% of untreated patients.
Conversely, 16% of the untreated control group worsened
during the study, compared with 2% of the treated group.
   "These are impressive data," said Jordan Gutterman, a
panel member and a pioneer interferon researcher at the
University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Side
effects consisted mostly of flu-like symptoms including
fatigue and nausea.
   To date, interferon has received approval for use in a
rare cancer known as hairy-cell leukemia, which affects about
2,500 people in the U.S., and in Kaposi's Sarcoma, an
AIDS-related malignancy with a roughly equal number of
patients, Schering said. The FDA has also approved its use in
treating genital warts.
   But analysts said FDA approval for chronic non-A, non-B
hepatitis would expand its potential market at least
five-fold. "We see this as adding another $100 million to
Schering's annual interferon sales," doubling last year's
level, said Michael Sorell, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in
New York. Looking ahead to continuing studies in other
cancers, not to mention in AIDS and hepatitis B, Dr. Sorell
predicted $300 million to $400 million in sales "looks
readily achievable" by 1993 to 1994. In the evolution of
biotechnology, Schering's Dr. Spielgel said, "Interferon is
an interesting story as the pioneering biotech product."
   It may also prove to be a classic case history of the new
biological agents which start small, and expand to fill
larger therapeutic roles as scientific knowledge about their
activity in the body and their potential use expands.
   Interferon was touted in the 1970s as a panacea, only to
prove disappointing and only narrowly useful at first. "A few
years ago, when interleukin-2 made the headlines, people
said: `Interferon -- so what?'" Dr. Spiegel said. "But it's
stood the test of time, and today's action puts us in a whole
new league."
   On Monday, an FDA panel withheld approval from
interleukin-2 as a treatment for kidney cancer, demanding
additional information from its maker, Cetus Corp. of
Emeryville, Calif.
   In a separate action, the FDA advisory panel recommended
that the agency grant Treatment IND (investigational new
drug) status to Immunex Corp.'s GM-CSF product. GHM-CSF is a
blood-cell growth factor that shows promise as a treatment
for bone marrow transplant failure in cancer patients and
those suffering certain kinds of anemia. However, the panel
asked Seattle-based Immunex for more study data before making
a formal recommendation to the FDA on market approval.
   Treatment IND status would make the drug more widely
available free of charge to patients during studies. About
5,000 patients receive bone marrow transplants each year.
