   FRANKFURT -- Daimler-Benz AG said it is now prepared to
negotiate the takeover of Spain's state-owned truck maker,
Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A., either alone or in
partnership with the government.
   Daimler, which is West Germany's largest industrial group
and one of the world's largest producers of cars and trucks,
said it has decided to seek an Enasa takeover on its own
rather than in partnership with other European truck makers
because it hasn't been able to find a suitable partner.

   Originally, Daimler had sought to take a 20% stake in
Enasa, with the West German engineering and truck group MAN
AG acquiring 60%. The plan called for the two companies to
manage Enasa jointly. But the arrangement was rejected two
weeks ago by the West German Federal Cartel Office on
antitrust grounds. MAN then dropped out of the running for
Enasa.
