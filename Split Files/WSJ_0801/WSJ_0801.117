   Energy Service Co., Houston, said it agreed to sell two
semi-submersible rigs and related equipment from its Penrod
Drilling Corp. affiliate's fleet of offshore and onshore rigs
to Wilrig AS of Norway for $95 million.
   Energy Service, an oil and gas drilling concern, said the
sale is expected to help finance a recapitalization of
Penrod, of which Energy Service, as partner in an investment
group, holds 40.2%.

   The sale is conditional upon completion of the purchase of
the remaining 31% of Penrod's senior debt and equity
securities by the investor group and another group holding
28.5%. Energy Service said the two groups expect to complete
that purchase by Oct. 31.
   Energy Service said the two rigs are currently operating
in the Gulf of Mexico, and are expected to be moved to the
North Sea by Wilrig. As part of the pact, Wilrig has options
to purchase three additional rigs.
