   TOKYO -- The Japanese economy's leading indicators for May
rose to 63.6, well above the boom-or-bust line of 50.0,
suggesting continued steady growth for the economy, Japan's
Economic Planning Agency reported.
   The leading indicators were up from a revised 54.5 in
April. It was the third consecutive month that the index
stayed above 50.0.

   The agency interprets any figure above 50.0 as a sign that
the economy should continue to expand over the next six
months, an official said. Any number below 50.0 is seen as a
sign that the economy could begin to contract.
   Although four of the 11 components of the index -- new job
offers, real machinery orders, construction orders and
consumer durable shipments -- fell from the previous month,
agency officials called the decline a reaction to high
previous levels rather than a sign of slowdown.
