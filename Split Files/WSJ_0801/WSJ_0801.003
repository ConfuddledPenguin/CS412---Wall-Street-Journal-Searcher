   WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved an amendment to the
campaign-financing bill that would prohibit foreign-owned
companies in the U.S. from forming political action
committees.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D.,
Texas), a critic of increasing foreign investment and
influence in this country, would outlaw PACs operated by
companies that are more than 50% foreign-owned. It was
approved by a vote of 73-27 during the Senate's second full
day of debate on legislation to overhaul the financing of
federal elections.

   Senate Democrats and Republicans have both embraced a
total ban on PACs, but are worried that such a stringent step
might not withstand constitutional challenge. The Bentsen
amendment would apply only if such an outright ban were ruled
unconstitutional.
   Federal law prohibits foreign nationals and corporations
from directly contributing money to U.S. political
candidates. Since 1978, through a series of advisory
opinions, the Federal Election Commission has said that as
long as a company is incorporated in the U.S, it isn't a
foreign entity and may sponsor a PAC if it follows certain
rules.
   In June, however, the commission reversed course and voted
to open a rule-making proceeding to prohibit PAC sponsorship
by U.S. corporations owned or controlled by foreign
interests. That could lead to regulations that would be
almost identical to the amendment passed by the Senate. A
similar amendment will probably be introduced when the House
takes up campaign-finance legislation later this week.
   Sen. Bentsen said his amendment would "limit what has been
a rapidly growing source of foreign influence on domestic
American politics." He cited a recent study done for his
office by the Congressional Research Service that showed PACs
of companies with significant foreign ownership gave $2.8
million to federal candidates in the 1987-88 election cycle,
representing 5% of the total given by all corporate PACs.
   Opponents of the amendment said it discriminated against
U.S. citizens who happen to work for companies that are
acquired by foreign conglomerates. "The effect will be to
create two classes of Americans," warned Sen. Mitch McConnell
(R. Ky).
