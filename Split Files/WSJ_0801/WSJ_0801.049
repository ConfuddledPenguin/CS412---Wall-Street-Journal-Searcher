   WOULD YOU PAY to be audited? New York state gets $110 an
hour from banks.
   The state says it collected an unseemly 37% of bank taxes
through audits in fiscal 1990. So to deter such delayed
payments, legislators directed tax collectors to impose an
audit fee during fiscal 1991. The rate is meant to equal
costs and produce $3 million; it is about what big CPA firms
charge for young staff, says Stanley Sherwood of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand. But the New York State Bankers Association says it
will seek to have the fee repealed and to prevent it from
being extended into the following year.

   Banks and CPAs complain that the fee could be expensive
and even exceed any tax deficiency revealed by an audit. And
what about verifying the bill, especially if a bank thinks
auditors wasted time on a wild-goose chase? Tax Commissioner
Wetzler says banks will be able to ask for an accounting. But
banks audited by the IRS or New York City could get a break;
the state often relies on such fee-free audits. The audit fee
is considered to be a deductible business cost.
   Oklahoma charges for travel expenses of auditors who go
out of state.
                                                                                                       

   HIGHER SIN TAXES drive revenues and jobs over state
borders, a study says.
   It's obvious that states with low taxes on cigarettes,
liquor and gasoline draw business from their neighbors. But
with sin taxes rising, the American Legislative Exchange
Council, a national group of conservative state legislators
seeking ammunition to fight increases, released a study
detailing some effects. In 1975-88, it says, high-tax
Massachusetts had average annual losses of $27.4 million in
excise-tax revenue and $132.6 million in retail sales because
residents dropped over to New Hampshire.
   The study by Price Waterhouse, CPAs, estimates the Bay
State lost 1,546 jobs paying $14.7 million a year. New
Hampshire, which has no sales or liquor tax and a lower
cigarette tax, gained $22.6 million in taxes on the increased
sales, plus 796 jobs, the study says. In the same years,
Illinois lost gasoline and cigarette sales to Indiana, which
lost liquor sales to Illinois.
                                                                                                       

   DON'T COUNT ON the IRS's estimates of enforcement revenue,
the GAO warns.
   Congress's General Accounting Office agrees that the IRS
can raise revenue with more staff for audit, collection, and
related programs. But a GAO report to Sen. Domenici (R.,
N.M.), says the IRS still estimates results of enforcement
efforts; it has no system to count the actual revenue.
Further, past estimates appear to have been "far too high" --
by 40%; and there are wide, unexplained differences between
IRS revenue forecasts and result estimates.
   The IRS's $6.1 billion budget for fiscal 1991, passed by
the House, would add 3,600 enforcement staffers; it estimates
they would increase revenue by $500 million in 1991 and by
$6.5 billion through fiscal 1995. But until the IRS develops
more reliable ways to measure results and forecast the
effects of staff increases, the GAO says, Congress should use
"the most conservative assumption" for added revenue.
   After saying for several years that enforcement efforts
produced $50 billion a year, the IRS changed its methods and
estimated 1989 results at $29.6 billion.
                                                                                                       

   BRITISH CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer Major writes Treasury
chief Brady to propose a joint inquiry into tax avoidance by
multinational companies. House hearings raised concerns about
price manipulation by foreign companies. But all nations face
the problem and should act together to allay damaging
suspicions, Major suggests.
                                                                                                       

   AMNESTY'S NOT FOR US, IRS Commissioner Goldberg and the
Treasury's Michael Graetz told a House panel last week. They
repeated contentions that a federal amnesty wouldn't raise
large revenues and could have counterproductive effects on
enforcement programs and compliant taxpayers.
                                                                                                       

   AWAY WITH WORDS] Encouraged by the IRS, the American Bar
Association's tax section has drafted proposals to simplify
and sharply condense hundreds of pages of regulations on
partnerships, employee benefits, and passive-activity losses.
                                                                                                       

   BIG CORPORATE AUDITS are the targets of an IRS improvement
plan.
   Neither the IRS nor companies are happy with the
decentralized special program for auditing the 1,565 largest
corporations. The IRS devotes 27% of audit resources to this
work, which produces about $10 billion in tax claims -- over
half the audit total. But the IRS concedes it loses tax
dollars because it lacks enough industry and issue expertise
and fails to coordinate activities that cross its district
lines. Companies complain of delays and inconsistencies.
   The IRS now has a plan to centralize and strengthen the
program. It calls for a national policy board, a national
program director, more industry and issue specialists,
improved training, and other measures. "Overall, it's a
positive step, although that depends on how they implement
it," says William Burk of CPC International, who is president
of the Tax Executives Institute, an organization of corporate
officials.
   Companies are wary of plans to involve IRS lawyers in
audits; but the IRS insists that the goal is technical aid,
not preparation for litigation.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Vermont has limited its income-tax credit against
property taxes to $2,000 a year and to people whose household
income doesn't exceed $60,000; there were no limits before. .

exemptions for certain foods, because they find the new law
too confusing to follow.
