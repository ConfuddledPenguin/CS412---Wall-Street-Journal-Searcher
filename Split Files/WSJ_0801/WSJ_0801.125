   PowerGen PLC reported pretax profit of #233.6 million
($431.6 million) for the year ended March 31. The company is
one of two U.K. electricity generating companies scheduled to
be privatized in February.
   The results, made public for the first time, also showed a
net loss of #79.9 million, after #185.8 million of
extraordinary provisions against the cost of layoffs and a
restructuring.

   Comparative figures for the year earlier weren't provided.
   Robert Malpas, PowerGen chairman, wouldn't comment on a
possible bid for the company by Hanson PLC, a British
industrial conglomerate, which the government has said might
pre-empt a public share sale.
   Mr. Malpas also wouldn't comment on speculation that
PowerGen management might launch its own bid for control of
the company.
