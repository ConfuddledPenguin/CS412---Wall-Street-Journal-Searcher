   PARIS -- France's independent stockbrokers are looking
nervously over their shoulders and they don't like what they
see: the fierce face of competition.
   The once-gentlemanly ways of the stockbrokering community,
little changed since Napoleon's times, were shattered in 1988
by France's "Big Bang" reforms.

   "Today the club has dissolved and it's no-holds-barred
when it comes to getting your neighbor's client," said Alain
Boscher, chairman of independent brokerage firm Boscher S.A.
   Ever since Tuffier, Ravier, Py &amp; Associes, one of France's
largest independent stockbrokage firms, went bankrupt last
month, rumors have run rife of who will be the next to go
under.
   Brokers talk of a list circulating in London that warns
investors away from certain Paris houses.
   And the independents are crying foul over a letter from
one of the larger brokerage firms, backed by a big foreign
bank, that stresses the limits of the Paris Bourse's new fund
that doesn't fully guarantee investors against losses caused
by brokerage firm bankruptcies.
   "It's shocking, and a sad state of affairs," Mr. Boscher
said of the letter from Sellier Natwest, owned by Britain's
National Westminster Bank PLC, to its clients.
   "The guarantee {fund} is limited. . . . Sellier offers you
security of a different dimension," says the letter from
Patrick Poupon, Sellier chairman.
   Mr. Poupon said in a telephone interview that he wasn't
trying to throw doubt on other French brokerages.
   "I want to defend Paris as a financial center," he said,
"But there will inevitably be a concentration in the number
of brokers." Only the weight of a major bank behind a broker
would guarantee "absolute security" for customers, he added.
   It isn't as though French brokerage firms have never gone
bankrupt before. But Tuffier's problems, and the ensuing
spate of rumors, highlight how stockbrokering in France has
changed recently.
   Under the Napoleonic Code governing the guild-like
community of stockbrokers from the nineteenth century until
1988, if any broker went under, the others were collectively
responsible for his debt. "We used to look after our own,"
said Jean-Pierre Pinatton, chairman of independent brokerage
firm Jean-Pierre Pinatton S.A.
   Big Bang changed that by allowing the mostly family-owned
partnerships to open their capital to French and foreign
financial institutions. Today only six of Paris's 43
brokerage firms are independent.
   The influx of money from banks, insurance companies and
foreign brokerage-firms, all keen for a seat on the Paris
Bourse, has made very rich men of some brokers. But the
influx also introduced a new breed of business-like manager
to the profession.
   Mr. Boscher said that with today's computerized trading,
brokers don't go to the exchange anymore. He knows the names
of only half of the brokerage firms' chairmen. And when they
do meet, except for the handful from the old school, brokers
call each other a formal "Monsieur."
   "How can you have any kind of solidarity between a major
financial institution and a Pinatton?" asked Mr. Pinatton.
   Mr. Pinatton is chairman of the Paris Bourse's guarantee
fund that came into effect at the beginning of this year.
   Tuffier was the first brokerage to qualify for protection
under the fund, which limits total refunds to 200 million
French francs ($37.2 million) for clients who cannot recover
their shares or cash from a bankrupt broker. No details are
available on how much the fund will have to pay out in
Tuffier's case.
   Tuffier was also the first Paris stockbrokerage firm to be
hit severely by the squeeze on brokers' margins since fixed
commissions were abolished last year.
   Thierry Tuffier, the company's chairman, blamed the firm's
demise on a price war among brokers and on a slump in trading
volumes. He added that many other firms are facing similar
losses.
   After Mr. Tuffier's remarks, several of the closely held
independents -- including Pinatton, Patrice Warny S.A. and
Fauchier Magnan, Durant des Aulnois -- broke with tradition
and disclosed half-year financial results.
   The independents were also quick to blame Mr. Tuffier's
problems on hubris, saying overambitious expansion raised the
firm's break-even point too high.
   The independents, arguing against allowing the market to
become the preserve of a few all-powerful banks, are quick to
dispute any suggestion that they will be the first to suffer
in a tight market.
   Philip Best, responsible for foreign sales at Fauchier
Magnan, said, "The key does not lie in being owned by a bank,
as any ex-employees of Greenwell Montague, Scrimgeour Vickers
or Morgan Grenfell would probably point out."
   Equities trading at all three British firms has been wound
up by their parent banks after large losses.
