   LONDON -- Redland PLC said it will take an initial 20%
stake in a European plasterboard joint venture headed by
Lafarge Coppee S.A. of France.
   Lafarge, a French building products manufacturer, and
Redland will combine their plasterboard operations and buy
out CSR Ltd.'s minority shareholding in Redland Plasterboard
PLC.

   Lafarge, whose other gypsum-product businesses and
majority stake in National Gypsum Co. are excluded from the
venture, will pay #39 million ($72 million) and Redland #16
million toward the acquisition of CSR's 49% stake in Redland
Plasterboard.
   Redland, which under the agreement is entitled to expand
its stake in the new venture to 33.4% after five years, said
the combination will form Europe's second-largest
plasterboard group. BPB Industries PLC, a British gypsum
products manufacturer, is currently the continent's largest
plasterboard supplier.
