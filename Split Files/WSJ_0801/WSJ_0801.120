   Moody's Investors Service Inc., New York, said it upgraded
the ratings on J&amp;L Specialty Products Corp.'s senior
subordinated notes to double B-3 from single B-2. The credit
rating change affects about $200 million of long-term debt.
   The ratings agency said it based its upgrade on the
financial strength of J&amp;L's new parent, French-based
Usinor-Sacilor, which Moody's views as investment grade.

   Moody's said it believes that J&amp;L, a stainless-steel maker
based in Pittsburgh, should benefit from Usinor-Sacilor's
commitment to augment investments in its American operations,
the parent's better access to financial markets, and its
expertise in stainless-steel production.
   Usinor-Sacilor, headquartered in Paris, is one of the
world's largest steel makers.
