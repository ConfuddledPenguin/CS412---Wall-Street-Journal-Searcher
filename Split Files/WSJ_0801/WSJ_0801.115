   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co. has sued Federal Insurance
Co. for allegedly failing to reimburse the media concern for
a $7.1 million settlement of a class-action suit over a
company pension plan.
   According to a complaint filed in federal court here,
Warren, N.J.-based Federal issued a "fiduciary liability"
policy to Times Mirror in September 1987, but has asserted
that the policy does not cover a dispute over the "excess
assets" of a Dallas Times Herald pension plan.

   Federal Insurance officials in Warren and in New York City
couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday.
   The class-action lawsuit against Times Mirror was filed in
Texas in December 1988. It charged Times Mirror with
breaching its fiduciary duty to employees by attempting to
terminate a pension plan and retaining about $14 million of
excess assets.
   A settlement increasing benefits to the lawsuit class
members by about $7.1 million was approved in June last year.
   According to the Times Mirror complaint, Federal argued
that Times Mirror was not acting in a fiduciary capacity in
regard to the pension plan, the class suit did not allege a
"wrongful act" as defined in the insurance policy, and the
policy does not cover benefits becoming due in the future
such as pension benefits.
   Federal has, however, paid more than $750,000 in legal and
actuarial costs arising out of the class action. The Times
Mirror suit seeks a declaration of rights plus $7.1 million.
