   NEW YORK -- Slower growth looms for the world's major
industrialized countries, judging from the countries' leading
indexes, the Conference Board said.
   The board's latest International Economic Scorecard shows
the composite index of leading indicators for the 11 major
countries as flat, indicating slower growth for the rest of
the year. The board said that, although none of the world's
three major regions looks encouraging economically, some
individual countries show strength.

   In Europe, West Germany's index rose 5%; in the Pacific
region, South Korea's index rose 6%; in North America, the
U.S. index is growing at a 1% rate.
   The growth rate for the 10 major industrialized countries
outside the U.S. was 5% a year ago but has dropped steadily
to 2% the past four months.
   "An important implication of the general pattern is that
the outlook for continued growth in U.S. exports has become
less sanguine," said Edgar R. Fiedler, economic counselor for
the Conference Board.
   Among other indexes, Japan's showed a 2% growth rate, as
did France's. The indexes for Britain and Canada each showed
a 1% decline.
   The Conference Board is a nonprofit business-research
organization.
