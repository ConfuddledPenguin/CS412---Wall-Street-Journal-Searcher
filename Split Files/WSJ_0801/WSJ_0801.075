   IRVINE, Calif. -- Troubled FundAmerica Inc., a discount
buying club under investigation by Florida authorities,
turned to financial writer Howard Ruff to bail it out of its
problems.
   Mr. Ruff, editor and publisher of "The Ruff Times," a
Springville, Utah-based financial newsletter, and operator of
several other businesses, was named president. The
59-year-old author will attempt to buy out founder Robert T.
Edwards and other shareholders within the next month, the
company said. Mr. Edwards resigned Monday as president and
chief executive officer of FundAmerica in the wake of the
Florida investigation.

   Florida authorities arrested Mr. Edwards July 19 on
charges of organized fraud and conducting an illegal lottery.
He is free on $1 million bail. The state also filed a
cease-and-desist order against FundAmerica charging that the
club is actually an elaborate pyramid scheme. If the order is
upheld, FundAmerica would be banned from doing business in
Florida.
   Mr. Ruff was one of several prominent investment advisers
to recommend FundAmerica to their clients. Mr. Ruff urged
readers of his newsletter and persons attending his recent
national convention in Los Angeles to join FundAmerica and to
sell memberships. He was one of several dozen "presidential
directors," people at or near the top of the chain of
salespeople in the organization. Economist Arthur Laffer was
a member of the organization's board but he resigned after
the announcement of Mr. Edward's arrest.
   FundAmerica, based in Irvine, Calif., sells $100 annual
memberships entitling members to rebates on vacations,
credit-card purchases, long-distance telephone calls and
purchases of consumer goods. If consumers spend enough,
rebates cover the yearly fee and accumulate in a savings
account for retirement.
   FundAmerica recruited sales representatives or "directors"
-- who paid $3,200 to sign on and who bought bundles of
memberships for resale. This is how the company really made
its money rather than through the members' purchases, Florida
authorities charge.
   FundAmerica operated in California, Florida, Texas,
Arizona, Utah, Washington and Colorado. A federal judge in
Irvine froze more than $20 million in company bank accounts
last Friday after several California investors sued Mr.
Edwards, alleging that he violated federal securities laws.
   Mr. Ruff gained fame in the late 1970s with a best-selling
book, "How To Prosper in the Coming Bad Times," in which he
suggested that readers store food and buy gold. When the bad
times never showed up, he switched into other advice,
recently recommending that middle-aged Americans start their
own businesses. FundAmerica was one of these.
