   Several years ago, Jerzy Kosinski wrote "Being There," a
strange little book (later turned into a Peter Sellers movie)
about a strange little man who, through no fault of his own,
was suddenly thrust into the whirl of American politics. A
simple fellow who had grown to maturity tending to his
business was an instant hit in official Washington: It had
not seen his like before. His every utterance was taken with
the utmost seriousness; he was acclaimed profound. All the
world hung on his every word.
   His words, however, were not what they appeared. He was a
simple man, with simple thoughts, who sought simply to
express them. His depth was added by his audience; the little
man had no depth at all. The joke was that his audience did
not know that; indeed, they did not care. He spoke to their
fears and their hopes and in so doing gave them what they
both wanted and needed.

   Enter Judge David H. Souter.
   By all accounts, Judge Souter is a very nice man: kind to
friends and family; a quietly pious fellow; a hard worker; an
old-fashioned frugal Yankee. But that is not what got him the
nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. What
got him to the courthouse door is the notion that he is
brilliant; he is, we are assured, "a scholar."
   To say the least, the evidence is thin. In a legal career
that has spanned nearly three decades, Judge Souter has
published nary a word on the law; delivered no memorable
speeches; and, if it is to be believed, has not so much as
engaged in spirited discussions with his closest friends and
associates about the most intellectually interesting ideas of
our time. By all accounts, the great public issues of our day
do not interest Judge Souter very much. This should be
troubling to conservatives and liberals alike.
   Neither side of the ideological divide should accept at
face value the assurances of President Bush and Sen. Warren
Rudman (R., N.H.) that Judge Souter is indeed a scholar and a
brilliant thinker. If the process of advice and consent is to
mean anything, the Senate has to refuse to limply accept that
he is a scholar worthy of the Supreme Court: It has to make
him prove it. The Constitution and the country deserve at
least that much.
   The one way to make sure that does not happen is to focus
on abortion to the near exclusion of everything else. That
strategy is already being put into play, at least in the
media. And the political shadows cast by Roe v. Wade (more
accurately now, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services)
threaten to obliterate any serious consideration of Judge
Souter's worthiness to sit on our highest court.
   The question is not how Judge Souter would or would not
vote on the issue of abortion; the question is how he
understands the Constitution and the nature and extent of
judges' power under that Constitution.
   At a minimum, the Senate -- both sides of the aisle -- has
to get to the bottom of this enigmatic man from Weare, N.H.
It has to resolve to know him, to know what he thinks, to
understand his conceptions of the law and judicial power.
   That will be easier said than done. But there is a way, a
way that would also carry with it political advantages for
all concerned -- including the country as a whole. The Senate
should refuse to broach the abortion issue during the
confirmation hearings. Period.
   By so doing, the Senate Judiciary Committee can give this
nominee a good deal greater scrutiny than if it allows the
process to slide into the abortion mire, there to sink
beneath the surface of reason. Indeed, it would provide the
perfect opportunity to exhibit something akin to
statesmanship by going beyond the instant heat of political
passion to the more permanent concerns that will confront the
Supreme Court as it lopes into the next century.
   There are many other areas of fruitful inquiry the Senate
can and should undertake. How does Judge Souter understand
the idea of separated powers; of federalism; of the role of
the founders' intention in constitutional construction?
   What is his view of "stare decisis," the binding power of
precedent? Does he believe precedents are sacrosanct or does
he, with Thomas Hobbes, believe that precedent merely shows
what was done, not what was done well? Again, going beyond
the particular cases to more general principles.
   Or take the big one: Is there a right to privacy in the
Constitution or not? But beyond that, how would he criticize
both Justice William O. Douglas's majority opinion in
Griswold v. Connecticut and Justice Hugo L. Black's famous
dissent? In other words, force the nominee to bring the
scholar's way of thinking to bear on one of the most famous
cases in American constitutional history.
   More generally on the question of the relationship of
higher law to the Constitution, the Senate can go beyond the
passions of the moment and focus on what is fundamental. Ask
the judge, for example, to share his views of Justice James
Iredell's rejection of natural law in constitutional
construction and Justice Samuel Chase's defense of it in the
1798 case Calder v. Bull. The fundamental legal issue is the
same -- only the politics have changed, have calmed down.
   To allow Judge Souter to escape close scrutiny would be an
injustice to the Constitution and the process of advice and
consent it provides. This is the nation's one chance to know
what this man thinks before he dons the robes that affect our
lives on a daily basis; perhaps more important, this is the
only chance to know how he thinks.
   The Senate can easily do this in a way that honors rather
than besmirches its reputation as a great deliberative body.
The acrimony of the Bork debacle can be avoided if the Senate
chooses to examine this man's scholarly credentials in a
scholarly way. That, after all, is what advice and consent
should be about.
