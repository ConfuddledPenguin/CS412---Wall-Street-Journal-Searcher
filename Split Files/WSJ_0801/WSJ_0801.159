   DALLAS -- Edisto Resources Corp. said it agreed to
purchase $10 million face amount of 13 1/4% convertible
secured notes issued by Hall-Houston Offshore for $17 million
in cash, plus accrued interest, from certain Prudential-Bache
Energy Growth Fund Partnerships.
   Edisto, an oil and gas exploration and production company,
said the notes are convertible into a general partner
interest representing 10.4% of Hall-Houston Offshore, a joint
venture formed in 1988 by Edisto and Hall-Houston Oil Co., a
closely held company, to develop and explore offshore Gulf of
Mexico reserves.
