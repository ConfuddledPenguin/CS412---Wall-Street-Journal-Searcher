   OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product fell 0.2% in May
from April on a decline in construction, Statistics Canada, a
federal agency, said.
   The May drop followed a 0.1% decline in April and a 0.2%
rise in March. Gross domestic product is the total value of a
nation's output of goods and services.
