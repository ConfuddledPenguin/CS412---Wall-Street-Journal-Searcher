   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. will
announce today that it is close to an agreement to sell its
typewriter and keyboard businesses and some printer
operations, industry and financial executives said.
   As reported, the computer giant has been negotiating to
sell the businesses in a leveraged buy-out valued at about
$2.5 billion. The buyer is expected to be Clayton &amp; Dubilier,
a leveraged buy-out firm that has made similar purchases of
low-technology businesses in the past.

   Spokesmen for IBM, Armonk, N.Y., and Clayton &amp; Dubilier,
New York, declined to comment. But some IBM employees said
the company called meetings for early this morning of all
managers and later of all employees in Lexington, Ky., where
IBM makes typewriters, keyboards and some printers for the
U.S. market. Securities analysts also said that IBM has
arranged a conference call for this morning.
   The industry and financial executives said that IBM won't
provide many details of the planned sale and cautioned that
it could be a few months before a final agreement is signed
on the complex arrangement.
   The executives added that after the IBM operations are
spun off, they will be headed by Marvin Mann, an IBM vice
president, in a move that could allay some concerns among
Lexington employees about their future.
   Leveraged buy-outs are often followed by the sort of heavy
cost-cutting that doesn't fit in a paternalistic culture such
as IBM's. But Mr. Mann, as a longtime IBMer, will bring much
of IBM's culture with him. In addition, in the mid-1980s, he
ran IBM's information products division, which includes the
Lexington facility, so he is known to many of the people
there.
   Separately, IBM said it discontinued production of several
models of its Personal System/2 personal computers, citing
poor demand.
   IBM doesn't break out sales figures for individual models,
but industry watchers said the discontinued machines -- the
PS/2 Model 60-041, Model 60-071, Model 80-041 and Model
80-071 -- were weak performers in a generally strong PS/2
family.
   "The Model 60 especially was very underpowered and wasn't
selling at all," said Marcia Sanford of Dataquest Inc., a
market research firm. "And the Model 80 was old technology.
IBM is just doing a bit of housecleaning here."
   Though they were all marketed as "servers," machines that
act as file cabinets and traffic cops for computer networks,
the discontinued models lacked the memory and processing
strength that are necessary as networks become more powerful.
   The two Model 60s will be replaced by the Model 65 SX,
introduced in March; and the two Model 80s will be supplanted
by faster, more capacious versions of the same basic machine,
also introduced in March.
   IBM said the computers may be ordered from existing stock
until Oct. 31 and that their list prices have been reduced by
24% to 34%.
