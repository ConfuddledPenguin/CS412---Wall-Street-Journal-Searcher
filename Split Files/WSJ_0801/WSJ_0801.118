   WASHINGTON -- Average prices received by U.S. farmers in
July were unchanged from June, as higher prices for milk and
vegetables offset lower beef and grain prices.
   Farm prices last month were still 2.7% higher than in July
1989, the Agriculture Department said. Milk prices averaged
$14.10 per hundredweight, up 30 cents from June. Commercial
vegetable prices rose 20% in July, while fruit prices rose
7.9%.
