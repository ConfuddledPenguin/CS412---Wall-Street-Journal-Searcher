   BETHESDA, Md. -- A National Institutes of Health panel
opened a new frontier in medicine by approving the first
human tests of gene therapy to fight disease.
   One experiment cleared by the panel will enable NIH
doctors to implant genes designed to enhance the body's
ability to fight metastatic melanoma, a fatal skin cancer.
The second experiment will test the use of gene implants to
treat ADA deficiency, a rare and congenital immune-system
defect.

   In recent years, scientists have traced a number of
inherited disorders, such as ADA deficiency, hemophilia and
cystic fibrosis, to specific malfunctions by genes, which
instruct cells to perform various tasks. At the same time,
researchers are concluding that diseases such as cancer,
diabetes, heart disease and some manic-depressive illnesses
partly result from genetic malfunctions. Thus, scientists
have begun to focus on therapies to replace missing genes or
to enhance the performance of existing genes as a possible
key to treating many diseases and disorders.
   Scientists believe that gene therapy will eventually
graduate from the laboratory to medical practice and emerge
as a common method of treating a wide range of diseases and
disorders. "In the next 20 years, we may be able to treat
some of the more common genetic diseases with gene therapy,"
predicted Robert Murray of the division of medical genetics
at Howard University in Washington. He said there would be
strong medical and commercial benefits in developing a gene
therapy for fairly widespread genetic defects, such as
sickle-cell anemia, which afflicts about 50,000 American
blacks. He also said the gene therapy eventually may treat
certain types of high blood pressure.
   Yesterday's approvals move gene therapy "from abstract
science to research and patient care," said Gerard McGarrity,
chairman of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the NIH
panel that cleared the tests. "The field of medicine has been
looking for this kind of therapy for a thousand years," he
said, calling the panel's votes "an historic moment."
   "Unfortunately, we don't know exactly what the
ramifications are," warned Mr. McGarrity, who is the
president of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in
Camden, N.J. "Nobody can say where this is going in the
future or how many applications we'll see."
   Scientists don't know for sure how -- or even whether --
human gene implants will work, much less the risks of trying
to fine-tune the body's genetic mechanism. Moreover, gene
therapy has attracted criticism from groups that worry it
could lead to pressure to tinker with genetic structures in
order to improve the human race.
   For these reasons, the NIH has put the proposals through a
rigorous review process. The Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee, a group of scientists, ethicists and lawyers, is
the last major hurdle. The Food and Drug Administration and
the acting director of NIH must still sign off on the
proposed experiments, but their approval is considered a
certainty.
   In both experiments, scientists will remove immune-system
cells from patients and grow large amounts of these cells,
called lymphocytes, in the laboratory. Then they will splice
specific genes into the cells and infuse them into the
patient. The cancer therapy will add a gene for
tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), a protein that destroys tumor
cells. The ADA therapy will add a gene responsible for the
enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). Victims of the disorder
lack ADA, which is responsible for clearing wastes from the
body.
   The tests will start in the fall on small numbers of NIH
patients who consent to take part in the experiments, which
draw heavily on gene-implant research done by French Anderson
of NIH's Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It may be some time
before scientists know how safe the therapies are and how
well they work.
   The advisory panel authorized Dr. Anderson and two NIH
colleagues, Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver, to start the
ADA therapy on as many as 10 children. The review process,
which took almost a year, was complicated by the fact that
all the test subjects will be children. In addition, there
are already two therapies available for patients with ADA
deficiency: bone marrow transplants, which only work for a
minority of the fewer than 10 children born each year in the
U.S. with the disorder; and the drug PEG-ADA, a treatment
developed about five years ago that improves immune response
in most patients. The researchers will administer the ADA
gene therapy along with PEG-ADA.
   Even though ADA deficiency is rare, it received wide
publicity several years ago from television reports of a
Texas boy who had to live in a plastic bubble to protect him
from infection and who subsequently died. Most victims of ADA
deficiency die from respiratory diseases in their youth.
   The panel authorized Steven Rosenberg of the National
Cancer Institute to test the safety of TNF therapy on as many
as 50 volunteers. In an unusual move, the panel approved Dr.
Rosenberg's proposal the first time he presented it. Members
of the panel said the quick approval came because Dr.
Rosenberg is dealing with terminally ill patients for whom
there is no therapy. In addition, Dr. Rosenberg, who has won
committee approval for two other experimental cancer
therapies, did an effective job of using new data from tests
with monkeys to address safety concerns.
   Monday, Dr. Rosenberg told the panel's Human Gene Therapy
Subcommittee that TNF has "almost been miraculous in what it
can do" in reducing tumors in mice. "Within 15 to 30 minutes
we can see necrosis and the dissolution of tumors." However,
he said that "TNF administration to humans has been an
abysmal failure" when attempted in a solution injected
intravenously.
   Now Dr. Rosenberg will insert TNF into tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes, especially grown and strengthened cells that are
designed to zero in on cancers in the body. He hopes that the
combination will produce a promising therapy.
   When administered in some earlier applications, TNF has
caused the body to begin wasting away. Dr. Rosenberg hopes
that the more targeted application will be less risky. The
point of his initial tests will be to test the human
tolerance and safety of TNF gene therapy when administered in
connection with interleukin-2, a protein made by Cetus Corp.
