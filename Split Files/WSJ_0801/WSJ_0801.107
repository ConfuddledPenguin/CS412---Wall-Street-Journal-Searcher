   UDC-Universal Development Limited Partnership, Tempe,
Ariz., said it retained an investment banker to help review
strategic and financial alternatives for the company to
"increase shareholder value."
   A spokesman said "we haven't limited our alternatives"
when asked whether the options might include a sale of the
partnership. The review wasn't prompted by any expressions of
interest from potential acquirers, he said.

   UDC-Universal, a home builder with operations in
California, Arizona, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, said
it believes its stock is undervalued because investors are
focusing on its current financial results rather than its
long-term value.
   UDC-Universal shares, which traded as high as $27.25
earlier this year, rose $1.375 to $13.625 yesterday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Last week, UDC-Universal reported that second-quarter net
income fell 59% to $4.9 million, or 16 cents a share, from
$12 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
