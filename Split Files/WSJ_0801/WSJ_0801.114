   WASHINGTON -- The White House said senior advisers to
President Bush will recommend a veto of House-passed
legislation to curb unsolicited sales pitches delivered by
fax machines and automatic telephone-dialing services.
   Under the bill, which passed by voice vote Monday,
consumers and businesses would have "the ability to `just say
no' to unsolicited telephone advertisements," said Rep.
Edward Markey (D., Mass.), an author of the legislation. But
a White House spokeswoman called the bill unnecessary, saying
the number of complaints are small and that problems can be
resolved through existing procedures.

   Under the bill, the Federal Communications Commission
would establish a national clearinghouse to keep a list of
consumers and businesses that don't want to receive "junk"
facsimile messages or recorded telephone solicitations
delivered by automatic dialing machines. Advertisers would
have to pay a fee for the list, but the service would be free
for consumers.
   The FCC would set penalties for advertisers that ignore
the list and would establish technical and procedural
standards for fax machines and automatic dialers.
   Junk-fax problems have mushroomed with the boom in
facsimile machine sales. Similarly, more and more consumers
have been bombarded with unsolicited pitches from automatic
dialers as telemarketers cut costs by reducing their work
forces. Many of the consumer complaints have been directed at
computerized dialing machines that tie up phone lines while
the machines deliver their messages.
   Just how far the bill can go is uncertain. The Senate
Commerce Committee has sent to the Senate floor a separate
telemarketing fraud bill with a provision that requires the
Federal Trade Commission to regulate automatic dialers,
banning those that tie up consumers' phone lines. A House
aide suggested that differences could be ironed out by a
conference committee.
   Separately, the Senate Commerce Committee approved by
voice vote a measure to allow telephone companies to provide
a "video dial tone," carrying movies and other
cable-television fare over the public switched network as
common carriers without the need to obtain a cable franchise.
Although the measure appeared to be a step forward for phone
companies, it could hurt them as they push for the ability to
own the content of video programming carried over their
networks.
   The argument is somewhat academic because the phone
networks currently aren't capable of carrying video signals.
Although the phone companies had told lawmakers that they
would speed up installation of fiber-optics networks if they
were allowed to own video programming, the potential problem
of phone companies using their monopoly phone service to
subsidize competitive video services outweighed any promised
benefits.
   The video dial-tone measure was substituted for a bill
that would allow independent telephone companies into the
cable business with limited ownership of programming. The
video dial-tone bill could be added to the cable legislation,
but cable and consumer groups said they believe the measure
kills the telephone companies' efforts to expand into cable.
   The seven regional Bell companies face an additional
hurdle: They are barred from the cable business by the
consent decree that broke up the Bell System in 1984. The
seven Baby Bells wouldn't be allowed into the business until
the consent decree restrictions are lifted.
