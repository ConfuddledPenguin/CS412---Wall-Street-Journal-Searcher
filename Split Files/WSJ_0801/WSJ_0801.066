   NEW YORK -- Bank bashing is big these days.
   Flying squads of regulators are forcing banks to own up to
billions in questionable loans. Rating agencies are
downgrading banks' credit ratings. Investors are dumping bank
stocks, driving prices to unprecedented lows against the
overall market.

   An overreaction? Hardly.
   While the real-estate boom that fueled bank profits in the
1980s has gone bust, the banking industry's woes run far
deeper than one of its periodic property slumps. What worries
analysts, investors and bankers themselves is the
ever-bleaker long-term outlook at many banks.
   "The real-estate problems could last 18 months or maybe
two years," says Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon
Brothers Inc. "But after that, where does the profitability
of the industry come from? It's not a pretty picture."
   The basic problem: One by one, the traditional wellsprings
of bank profits are drying up. Lending to America's blue-chip
corporations, once the big banks' lucrative "raison d'etre",
has dwindled. The merger-and-acquisition mania, with its fat
fees for lenders, has faded, leaving banks stuck with too
many loans to dangerously leveraged companies. Even booming
businesses such as credit cards are under siege from powerful
new competitors. And billions of dollars in bad debts to
developing countries still haunt many big banks.
   The banking climate is "as difficult as any in the history
of the global financial-services industry," says Thomas G.
Labrecque, the president of Chase Manhattan Corp., parent of
the nation's second-largest bank. Mr. Labrecque is a man who
knows. Chase celebrated his pending promotion to the
chairmanship last month with a shakeup that could cost as
many as 3,000 of the bank's 41,600 employees their jobs.
   But not only bank employees are at risk. The nation's
banking system is built on confidence, and if, as seems
likely, banks' problems linger for years, that confidence
will be sorely tested. A weakened banking industry, in turn,
could hurt the global competitiveness of many smaller U.S.
companies, which would find borrowing more difficult.
   Despite all the bad news, however, the banking industry
isn't on the verge of a collapse like that of the savings and
loan industry, which has left taxpayers saddled with a
multibillion-dollar bailout bill. Many analysts predict that
a big bank or two may fail this year or next and that the
already-skimpy profits of most big banks are likely to get
skimpier. But compared with S&amp;Ls, banks have a much larger
capital cushion to absorb economic shocks, they are better
regulated and managed, and they aren't rife with the outright
fraud that undermined some S&amp;Ls.
   Although the groaning over the big banks' plight focuses
on bad loans, the real problem isn't necessarily the loans
made in the past. Rather, it's the good loans that banks
aren't making now. Plain-vanilla corporate lending used to be
the big banks' main business, but years ago major
corporations began seeking cheaper financing in the debt and
securities markets.
   Now, according to Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a top-rated
industrial company can raise funds by selling commercial
paper, short-term IOUs, at only 7.85% to 7.95%, slightly less
than the 7.9% to 8% that a top-rated bank would pay. A
corporation just a step down in the ratings would pay 8% to
8.1%, while a similarly rated bank's cost would be 8.2% to
8.3%. Add in the bank's operating costs and a profit, and it
clearly will have a hard time lending to such an industrial
company.
   Faced with tough competition, big banks have had to cut
their lending rates, and that, in turn, cuts into profits. In
the 1980s, banks earned an anemic 7% to 12% return-on-equity
on loans to large corporations, says James McCormick,
president of First Manhattan Consulting Group. And despite
the efforts to trim rates, corporate lending has declined
steadily as a percentage of total bank loans, and banks have
tried to push such fee-generating services as helping
corporations manage their cash and issuing letters of credit.
But in those fields, too, they face intense competition and
razor-thin profit margins.
   Only now is the damage from the erosion of banks'
corporate-lending business becoming apparent, however. For a
while, the extent of the problem was obscured by the rich
fees and high margins that banks earned by financing the
1980s merger boom. These highly leveraged transactions helped
swell banks' average returns to a more respectable 14% to
18%. The low-margin corporate lending "was just being
subsidized," Mr. McCormick says.
   But as a result of muscling into investment banking, the
big banks are now stuck with some of the same problems facing
their cousins on Wall Street -- highly paid deal makers with
an acute shortage of deals to make. "Banks went out and put
together these talented teams of brain surgeons, but now they
have few patients," Mr. McCormick says.
   At Bankers Trust, one of the biggest banks to adopt a
merchant-banking strategy, Ralph McDonald, head of corporate
finance, acknowledges that the slack pace of new deals is
hurting the bank. But he expects a quick recovery. He
believes that Bankers Trust can increase its European
business by brokering some of the cross-border mergers and
acquisitions that are likely as the Common Market drops trade
barriers in 1992 and Eastern Europe struggles to shape up. In
addition, Bankers Trust, like most investment firms,
anticipates hefty fees from helping U.S. companies
restructure to lighten the enormous debt burdens stemming
from the merger and buy-out binge.
   "There's going to be a demand for brain surgeons to repair
other peoples' botched operations," Mr. McDonald says.
   A resurgence in deal making is especially critical to
Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., two big banks that lack
consumer-banking operations. For many other banks, however,
consumer banking has largely offset the decline in corporate
lending. But consumer banking is a highly competitive game.
   In recent years, for example, banks' long-profitable
auto-loan business has been losing ground to the auto makers'
captive finance units, such as Ford Motor Credit Corp. and
General Motors Acceptance Corp. Just as in the corporate-loan
field, many banks have been hurt in auto lending because they
now have lower credit ratings than the auto makers' units and
thus can't raise money as cheaply.
   Auto lending has become so difficult that Marine Midland
Banks Inc., the nation's fourth-largest auto lender after the
three big captive auto-finance companies, is throwing in the
towel. Marine Midland is negotiating the sale of its
auto-finance subsidiary, which holds about $6 billion of auto
loans, to Ford Motor Co.
   Credit cards are the current, often-lucrative fad among
big banks. Citicorp, the nation's largest credit-card issuer,
earned $600 million in 1989 from credit cards. But a
successful card operation requires huge investments in
technology and huge outlays for marketing; for this reason,
many smaller banks have sold their credit-card portfolios to
bigger banks.
   Over the past five years or so, the credit-card business
"has become a game of economies of scale," says Robert H.
Burke, general manager of Bank of New York's credit-card
operation. "In effect, you're running a factory, and the more
volume you can push through your fixed costs, the better the
profits are." Augmented by the recent purchase of a
650,000-account credit-card portfolio from Houston-based
First City Bank, the Bank of New York's card operation has
grown since the beginning of 1989 to $3.8 billion in
outstanding charges from $2.6 billion.
   Moreover, big new credit-card players, such as American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., are
taking on the banks. In just four months, AT&amp;T has signed up
more than a million Visa and MasterCard accounts with its
offer of no-fee cards and discount long-distance phone calls.
Bankers profess no great concern about AT&amp;T's entry into the
field, but some banks are challenging it in court. And within
a few weeks, Citicorp countered by offering cheap credit-card
calls through MCI Communications Corp.
   Through all this, the increase in problem loans continues
to plague banks. Witness how some premier banks scrambled to
bail out Donald Trump after he failed to meet debt payments;
the banks had already lent the real-estate developer hundreds
of millions of dollars without requiring any collateral.
Real-estate problems continue to mount in New England and New
York, and now the highflying California real-estate market is
losing altitude.
   "It's very difficult at this stage of the cycle to
understand what the losses will be to the banks," says Judah
S. Kraushaar, a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch. He notes that
in the 1970s real-estate crunch, some banks lost 30% of the
principal of their real-estate loans -- and that was without
an overhang of foreclosed S&amp;L properties.
   Also dragging down bank profits are the Third World loans.
Eight years after the loans began going sour, U.S. banks are
still stuck with more than $40 billion of them. Citicorp
Chairman John Reed argues that although his bank still holds
some $8 billion of Third World loans -- the biggest one-bank
total -- the problem is, for all practical purposes, behind
it.
   Regulators and investors disagree. Federal regulators
recently demanded that banks write off 20% of the money still
owed them by Brazil. That won't hurt some big banks, such as
J.P. Morgan, that have hefty reserve coverage for the loans,
but it will cut deeply into banks with less coverage --
Citicorp among them.
   Still lurking in the wings are an estimated $55 billion of
loans stemming from the wave of mergers, acquisitions and
buy-outs. Many of these once-glamorous leveraged deals have
been turned by the sluggish economy into desperately shaky
operations struggling to meet debt payments.
   With all the banking problems, it isn't surprising that
the S&amp;L crisis is never far from bank regulators' minds.
Signs of trouble late last year in the once-thriving New
England real-estate market set the Comptroller of the
Currency, the principal regulator of nationally chartered
banks, off on a binge of so-called targeted real-estate
examinations aimed at forcing banks to identify shaky
real-estate loans. As the property slump spread beyond New
England, the vigor of the examinations increased.
   Other agencies are getting tougher, too. With S&amp;L fraud so
rampant, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently
required Ohio's Banc One Corp., a highly respected regional
bank, to put this disclaimer on the front of its prospectus
for a 10-million-share sale: "The shares of common stock
offered hereby are not savings accounts, deposits or other
obligations of the bank or savings association and are not
insured by the FDIC, Bank Insurance Fund or any other
government agency."
   The SEC says such warnings to investors will now be
standard for all bank securities issues; so will tougher
reviews of offering documents. A Banc One spokesman comments,
"This was a very, very thorough review. They had a prepared
set of questions that we had to reply to, even though many
didn't pertain to us."
   As banks' financial performance has eroded, credit-rating
agencies have been merciless in downgrading bank debt. Of the
nation's 50 largest banks, only one, Bank of America, has
been upgraded in the past six months; many more have been
downgraded. Such giants as Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Banking have lower ratings than many of their
potential corporate customers.
   Both MNC Financial Corp., the parent of the biggest bank
in the Baltimore-Washington area, and Midlantic Corp., based
in Edison, N.J., have endured the ignominy of having their
debt classified as "junk." Trading in Midlantic debt "is
virtually by appointment," says Ann L. Robinson, a bond
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. And
because of investor anxiety, NCNB Corp., another large
regional bank, had to halt a $150 million private offering of
preferred stock. That forced NCNB to drop plans to bid for
Miami-based CenTrust Savings Bank.
   Bankers, in turn, complain that regulators are too harsh
and ratings agencies too finicky. Such clampdowns force banks
to increase their loan-loss reserves, write off more loans
and increase their capital levels -- to the detriment of
already-sick profit margins.
   Although none of the big banks have been forced by the
mounting problems to alter long-range strategies, those
strategies are being subordinated as bank managers scramble
to meet the crisis of the moment. Personnel layoffs and
retreats from some lines of business have become common.
Several thousand bank employees have already lost their jobs,
mostly in New England and New York, and thousands more will
be let go as banks such as Chase and Manufacturers Hanover
implement announced cost-cutting plans.
   But however unpleasant cutbacks are, many bank executives
find even more dismaying having to think about what most
experts, and bankers themselves, agree is the real long-term
solution to the industry's ills: consolidation.
   With more than 12,600 banks, the U.S. simply has far more
than it needs. Overcapacity wasn't a problem when banking
laws gave banks virtual oligopolies in their communities. But
the liberalization of interstate banking laws and the success
of nonbank competitors such as money-market funds, securities
firms and finance arms of industrial companies have given
savers and borrowers new choices.
   Now, bankers have to consider the once unthinkable:
mergers with cross-town rivals. For instance, a merger of
Chase, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover might reduce
overhead by as much as $700 million a year. But it's a rare
bank chairman who would be willing to hand over the reins to
a former rival.
   Nevertheless, many analysts expect that once current
real-estate problems have bottomed out, market forces will
eventually push many banks into consolidation. U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke predicts that the
number of U.S. banks will drop to fewer than 11,000 in the
next year and a half.
   That probably would still be too many. Although no one
suggests that the U.S. banking system should dwindle to just
six big banks, as Canada's has, thousands more institutions
probably must vanish for banking to prosper again.
