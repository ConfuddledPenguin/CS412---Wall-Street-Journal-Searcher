   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms declined slightly in the week ended
Tuesday.
   The average yield on six-month small-denomination CDs sold
directly by banks slipped to 7.53% from 7.55%, according to
an 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a New York
information service. The average for two-year consumer CDs
fell to 7.79% from 7.80%. However, the average yield for a
five-year consumer CD remained at 8.02%.

   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker dealers were also down. The average yield on a
one-year CD fell the most, to 7.80% from 7.93%, while the
average for five-year CDs fell to 8.27% from 8.34%, according
to Banxquote.
   Average yields for large-denomination CDs, which typically
require deposits of $90,000 or more, declined. The average
yield on a one-year jumbo CDs eased to 7.68% from 7.79%,
while the average for two-year maturities slipped to 7.90%
from 7.97%.
   "Many big banks cut their jumbo rates, which may be a sign
that they expect rates to fall further," says Norberto Mehl,
chairman of Banxquote.
