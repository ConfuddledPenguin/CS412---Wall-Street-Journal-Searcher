   It's that time of year again. The boat people are heading
out of Vietnam and putting their lives at risk in hope of
finding a safe haven.
   But even if they escape the pirates and the perils of
ocean travel in unseaworthy vessels, there is no assurance
they will reach their goal. If picked up at sea by merchant
or naval vessels, they may not be allowed to disembark
because Indonesia, Macao and Singapore will not allow them
first asylum. If they reach Malaysia or Thailand, they are
likely to be turned away and pushed back to the open sea. If
they reach Hong Kong, they face the arbitrary distinction
between economic and political deprivation; 90% will be
"screened out" as people "merely seeking a better life," as
one British official put it. In consequence, they may be sent
back forcibly to Vietnam, a fate many view as worse than
death.

   This pathetic human drama continues, along with the
attendant juridical and political nonsense that keeps
desperate people from finding safe harbor. About 194,000
Indochinese refugees are languishing in camps in Southeast
Asia because no one will give them a home. Some of them have
been interned for as long as 10 years.
   It is this situation that the U.N.-sponsored conference on
refugees -- a rite of summer as sure as waves of boats from
Vietnam -- is considering this week in Geneva. The favored
"solution" of many of the convention's participants is to
ship the boat people back, mostly to Vietnam and against
their will if necessary, and to pretend that they are not
"real" refugees.
   The irony is that just as it has become much more
difficult for boat people to resettle because countries
everywhere -- including the U.S. -- are cutting their refugee
quotas, the boat people who made it have proved their worth
as immigrants.
   From 1981 to 1986, my colleagues and I conducted a
large-scale study of the economic and social adaptation of
nearly 7,000 boat people, constituting nearly 1,400
households across the U.S. The refugees were predominately
Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese from Vietnam; the remainder
were Lao. All had been allowed into the U.S. during the late
1970s.
   Unlike those airlifted out of Vietnam after the fall of
Saigon in April 1975, this wave of refugees had limited
education and occupational skills, little or no prior contact
with the West, and endured greater hardship in their effort
to flee -- in short, they were much like today's boat people.
Only one in 10 knew enough English on arrival to be able to
count or to read street signs and, in terms of material
belongings, they arrived with nothing. In addition, they
entered the U.S. during its worst recession since the Great
Depression.
   Nonetheless, in a few years the adults had found
employment and climbed out of poverty, while their children
surprised even experts in refugee resettlement with their
remarkable academic progress. Indeed, little in their
backgrounds prepared us to expect the great leaps that gave
them parity or better with other Americans in such a brief
period.
   According to our studies, unemployment dropped sharply
from almost 90% during the first months of resettlement to
about 15% for those in the U.S. for 3 1/2 years or more. (The
nationwide unemployment rate at the time ran as high as 11%.)
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, today the
unemployment rate among all Indochinese -- including the
Hmong and Cambodians, who have not been as economically
successful as the Vietnamese -- is 8%, against a national
average of 5.3%.
   When the unit of analysis is the household instead of the
individual, an even more encouraging picture emerges. The
number of jobs per household increased the longer the
refugees were in the U.S. By the end of three years, there
were about as many -- 42% -- two-job households as one-job
homes. After three years, almost 85% of all households had at
least one person working, and half of those had two. This was
because with few exceptions, the first parent who could find
a job took it and the other spouse entered the labor force as
soon as the youngest child reached school age. The steady
increase in the percentage of multiple-job households is the
main reason for the boat people's consistent economic
improvement.
   The boat people in the U.S. for four months or less earned
only 46% of the poverty-level standard. By their 40th month,
however, the 1,400 households studied were earning an average
of 171% of the poverty standard, or about $1,400 per month
per household ($16,800 a year). That still falls short of
middle-class comfort, but it is adequate to meet basic needs
and to attain a reasonable standard of living.
   And remember, the boat people achieved this during the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when the U.S. was in a recession,
and unemployment and poverty levels were rising. During these
hard times, the boat people not only survived, but improved
their economic status.
   Equally remarkable is the scholastic achievement of the
refugee children. Although in the U.S. for an average of less
than three years at the time of our study, and with virtually
no English skills upon arrival, four out of five of the
children attained a very high (A or B) overall grade-point
average, compared with about 27% of American children as a
whole. In general, the school grades for the Indochinese
refugee children were highest in courses with no language
component. For example, almost half -- 47% -- earned an A in
math.
   School administrators across the country reported that the
refugee children excelled in their schoolwork not only in an
absolute sense, but also when compared to their non-refugee
cohorts. Said one superintendent of a city school system,
"These children are hard-striving and eager to learn.
Teachers feel rewarded to have them, even in overcrowded
classrooms."
   The administrators often referred to the boat children's
overrepresentation among valedictorians to underscore the
point. For example, in Garden Grove, Calif., in 1985 the
Indochinese refugee community made up less than 20% of the
school population, yet 12 of the 14 high school
valedictorians were of Indochinese refugee background.
Finally, conversations with administrators and examination of
transcripts revealed virtually no suspensions, drug use, or
serious misconduct among the children of the boat people.
   In view of the time the boat people spent in refugee
camps, the disruption of life, and their lack of English and
transferable job skills, their economic and educational
attainments are stunning. To a surprising degree the boat
people have achieved a high level of control over their
destiny -- something that cannot be said of their compatriots
in Vietnam.
   What is done about a problem depends on how it is defined.
In Hong Kong, which suffers both a labor shortage and a brain
drain, the boat people themselves -- not the country they
have fled -- have been fingered as the problem. That was the
principle behind the June 1988 decision by Hong Kong's
British authorities to institute a screening process that
could discern the supposed difference between "economic
migrants" and "political refugees."
   Screening has changed the way refugees are treated not
only in Southeast Asia, but world-wide. Refugees are becoming
regarded as a social malignancy, instead of as victims. In
regard to the boat people, it seems paradoxical that such
gross injustice should be applied at a time when many nations
could take them in. The U.S. and much of Western Europe, for
example, bemoan the shortage of labor and the failure of
their own citizenry to show the energy and dedication needed
for an achieving society -- the very attributes that the boat
people have demonstrated by their success in the U.S.
   The boat people have proved that they are solid,
productive citizens, even under difficult circumstances. The
Geneva conference should note that the way to solve the
"problem" of the boat people is to get them out of the camps
and into societies where they can get on with their lives.
