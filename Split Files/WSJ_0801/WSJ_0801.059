   WASHINGTON -- The Student Loan Marketing Association said
that it has agreed to lend another $200 million to the Higher
Education Assistance Foundation, the financially troubled
student-loan guarantee agency.
   Sallie Mae said the Education Department asked it to
provide the short-term financing while the government
continues its efforts to find an entity to take over the
assets and operations of HEAF. Sallie Mae, a
government-chartered, stockholder-owned corporation that has
created a secondary market for student loans, and several
other guarantee agencies are candidates to take over HEAF's
guaranteed student-loan portfolio, which totaled $8.8 billion
as of July 17, according to congressional auditors.

   The government has engaged Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., the Wall
Street unit of General Electric Co., to help it sort out its
options.
   The additional $200 million short-term financing is
collateralized by student loans, and the Education Department
has assured Sallie Mae that it will reinsure 100% of these
loans. Prior to the latest loan, Sallie Mae had loaned HEAF
$200 million and loaned affiliates of HEAF about $600
million. In addition, Sallie Mae owns about $2.4 billion of
loans guaranteed by HEAF. Sallie Mae asserts that it faces no
risk on these assets because they are fully reinsured by the
Education Department.
