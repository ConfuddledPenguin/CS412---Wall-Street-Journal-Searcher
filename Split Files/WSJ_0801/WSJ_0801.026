   NEW YORK -- New troubles for the proposed UAL Corp.
buy-out failed to seriously shake the stock market.
   Despite indications that two more of the major banks
involved in the employee buy-out had withdrawn, the market
avoided the steep downturn that took place last October when
an earlier buy-out proposal fell through.

   Share prices rebounded from a late bout of selling to
finish mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 12.13
to 2905.20, but broader indexes managed to post modest gains.
Advancers outnumbered decliners by 817 to 731 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Oil and utility stocks, which set the pace Monday as the
industrial average climbed 18.82, once again were market
leaders. The Dow Jones index of energy stocks rose more than
1.5%, while the Dow Jones Utilities Average gained 2.96 to
210.01.
   Among other measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
rose 0.60 to 356.15, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.42 to 194.60 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained 0.47 to 329.96. Big Board volume swelled to
173,810,000 shares from 146.5 million Monday.
   "From a trading standpoint, it still seems like it's
fairly quiet," said Ronald B. Doran, director of
institutional trading at C.L. King &amp; Associates, Albany, N.Y.
Concern about economic reports coming later this week is
keeping many investors out of the market, he said.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 31.57 to
1093.43, its first close below 1100 since late February. UAL,
which skidded 16 7/8 to 140, accounted for most of the
decline.
   The sell-off in UAL, the parent of United Airlines, came
amid indications that the group of five banks that had agreed
to lead the labor group's effort to arrange funding may be
falling apart. UAL plunged after two more banks, Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan, indicated they have withdrawn temporarily
from work on the proposed $4.38 billion, $201-a-share
buy-out.
   On Monday, this newspaper said Chemical Banking Corp. had
withdrawn.
   Andrew Geller, an airline analyst at Provident National
Bank of Philadelphia, said the odds that the union-led group
will be able to complete the deal are "too close to call" at
this point.
   "There's just a general lack of feeling that they will get
financing," Mr. Geller said, adding that his price target for
the stock if there isn't any prospect for an accord would be
$120 a share.
   Last Oct. 13, the industrial average plunged 190.58 points
amid a wave of heavy selling in the wake of news that the
unions hadn't been able to obtain the financing for an
earlier buy-out offer.
   This time around, the downturn wasn't nearly so severe.
The average hit bottom in late trading with a loss of about
28 points as sell programs related to stock-index arbitrage
pushed prices lower.
   "We have a market that is really basically trying to find
some direction here," said C.L. King's Ronald B. Doran, as
some investors pin their hopes for higher stock prices on the
possibility of lower interest rates.
   That prospect has drawn attention to this week's key
economic data, which include the July survey of corporate
purchasing managers, due today, and the July employment
report, set for Friday.
   Student Loan Marketing Association, the Big Board's most
active issue, sank 2 7/8 to 42 3/8 as 2.3 million shares were
traded. The company said it has agreed to lend as much as an
additional $200 million to Higher Education Assistance
Foundation, a financially strapped guarantor of student loans
that counts Sallie Mae among its major creditors.
   Nervousness about potential weakness in California's real
estate market fueled selling in issues of bank and thrift
holding companies based in the state. Wells Fargo fell 3 3/8
to 68 1/2, Security Pacific lost 1 1/4 to 31 5/8, First
Interstate Bancorp dropped 2 1/8 to 33, HomeFed dropped 1/4
to 11 1/8 and Glenfed fell 3/8 to 11.
   And CalFed, which fell 1 1/2 Monday, went down another 1
to 10 3/8 as recent heavy activity in the stock continued.
Selling by a large institutional shareholder appeared to be
fueling the stock's downturn, traders said. CalFed, which
recently reported a $53 million loss for the second quarter,
said there weren't any new corporate developments to explain
the decline.
   Chase Manhattan dropped 1/2 to 19 1/8 on 1.5 million
shares. Dividend-related trades by institutions swelled
activity in the bank holding stock, which now has a 13.4%
dividend yield. The record date for the next quarterly payout
is today.
   Lowe's tumbled 2 3/4 to 29 7/8. Salomon Brothers and
Merrill Lynch both downgraded the stock and reduced its
earnings projections for the fiscal second quarter and year
Monday, when the stock fell four points on the Big Board.
Salomon analyst Jack D. Seibald subsequently reiterated his
comments.
   Arkla fell 1 3/4 to 22 on 1.4 million shares following
news of its plans to acquire Diversified Energies in a stock
swap valued at about $630 million. Diversified Energies rose
5 7/8 to 35; Arkla agreed to exchange stock worth about $39 a
share for each common share of the company.
   Freeport-McMoRan Oil &amp; Gas rallied 2 to 10 on 1.2 million
shares. Freeport-McMoRan Inc., which already owns 81.5% of
its common shares, agreed to swap stock valued at $10.50 a
share for the rest. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. lost 1/4 to 35 1/8.
   Exxon rose 1 1/8 to 51 7/8 on 2.3 million shares, and
other oil stocks also posted solid gains. Chevron climbed 1
1/4 to 79 3/8, Texaco rose 1/4 to 63 1/4, Mobil went up 1/8
to 65 1/4 and Amoco rose 7/8 to 55 5/8; among oil-services
issues, Schlumberger climbed 2 1/4 to 65 3/8 and Halliburton
gained 1 5/8 to 54 7/8.
   Smith Corona advanced 1 to 5 3/4 on 1.3 million shares.
After falling sharply in the year since Britain's Hanson PLC
sold a 50% stake to the public at $21 a share, the stock may
now rank among the market's best buys, this newspaper
reported in its "Heard on the Street" column.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.05
to 353.60. Volume totaled 12,560,000 shares.
