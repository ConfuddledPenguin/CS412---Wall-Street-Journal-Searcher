   In response to your July 3 editorial-page article "Through
the Open Door: What Is It Like to Be an Immigrant in
America?" Of the immigrants interviewed, eight were from
other than an English-speaking country. Of these eight, five
made comments worth reviewing for the reasons they came to
America. These are shortened and excerpted as follows:
   1. ". . . Hitler would invade Switzerland."

   2. ". . . from Nazi Germany in 1937."
   3. ". . . fleeing Castro and his communist thugs."
   4. ". . . the Nazis broke into our house."
   5. ". . . for the same reasons as everyone."
   The thought occurred to me that these people's families
had some place to come to in order to escape totalitarianism.
   If America loses its freedoms, where would the immigrants
of today go?

   Your article hardly shows an awareness of, or sensitivity
to, the broad spectrum of immigrants who make up the
diversity of the U.S. population.
   Contrary to your statement, virtually every American does
not know where he or she comes "from." The largest part of
the American black population, involuntary immigrants whose
families were torn apart before and after they reached our
shores, cannot trace where they come from (or can do so only
with great difficulty and diligence).
   I realize the thrust of your article was statements by 13
naturalized prominent Americans and was not meant to be
representative. I respect your right to make an editorial
judgment. However, why five Germans and three Canadians out
of a group of 13 "immigrants"? (If you count the British-born
Bob Hope and Swiss-born Madeleine Kunin, that is two more
white Anglo-Saxon types in the top-heavy majority.) Where are
the Asians, Italians and Latin Americans who contribute so
heavily to the monetary and cultural wealth of our country?
There must be a few who are "prominent."

   I was puzzled by your selection. Note the following
breakdown:
   -- Five German-born
   -- Three Canadian-born
   -- Three other European-born
   -- Two Caribbean-born
   -- All Judeo-Christians
   No Oriental-born, no South American-born, no African-born.
Also, no representatives of large immigration countries such
as Ireland and Italy.
   The professional breakdown also puzzles me:
   -- Seven politicians
   -- Two artists
   -- Three academics
   -- One business person
   Are you saying America is the land of political, rather
than business opportunity? That artists and capitalists are
less relevant to our country's development?

   May I point out that nearly every one of the immigrants in
the article came to this country when the door was not quite
so open, because certain standards of decency and selectivity
were applied.
   For the benefit of those too young to remember them, let
me enumerate the three principal requirements for admission:
   1) You had to prove that you would not become a public
charge within the foreseeable future, either by being
personally solvent or by obtaining an affidavit of support
from a responsible and solvent person.
   2) You had to give evidence of a clean criminal record in
every country where you had resided before coming to the U.S.
   3) You had to produce a medical certificate that you were
not afflicted with any contagious or disabling disease.
   In other words, we had an immigration policy in those
days.

   The immigration experience also includes the
African-Americans. We, too, know and remember that our
ancestors were from a foreign land. We, too, have been
transplanted, although not by choice. The only difference is
that we were never entitled to a naturalization ceremony. Too
bad you didn't choose some African-Americans to tell about
their or their relatives' immigration experiences -- they
would have a very different story. The weight of slavery's
shackles will never leave our memories.
