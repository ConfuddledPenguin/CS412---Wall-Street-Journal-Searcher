   DALLAS -- Triton Energy Corp., hoping to bolster its
sagging share price, said it will sell assets, reduce debt,
cut overhead and eliminate its current 10-cent quarterly
dividend.
   The company's restructuring is the latest in a series of
moves, which include earlier asset sales and a poison pill
plan adopted in June, to keep raiders at bay. New Zealand
investor Sir Ronald Brierly has accumulated 10.9% of the oil
and gas exploration company and has said he might seek
control.

   Triton said it hopes to raise $150 million by selling
aviation operations at nine airports, some of its U.S. oil
and gas interests and its securities portfolio. Triton also
expects to spin off its seismic equipment subsidiary,
Input/Output Inc., in a public stock offering. "The primary
focus of the company will be redirected toward . . . oil and
gas exploration projects," said Chairman William I. Lee.
   The company said it will use the proceeds to reduce
long-term debt. One-time charges related to the sales will
deepen the losses that Triton expects for its fourth quarter
and fiscal year ending May 31.
   The company's losses have battered Triton stock over the
past year. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, Triton shares closed up 25 cents at $11.875.

   TRITON ENERGY Corp. eliminated a 10-cent annual dividend
as part of its restructuring. Yesterday's edition misstated
the amount.
