   Shareholders in Alan Bond's financially troubled Bond
Corp. Holdings Ltd. agreed to a proposal to sell the
company's Australian brewing assets to independently managed
affiliate Bell Resources Ltd.
   But a banking syndicate led by National Australia Bank
Ltd. that is owed 880 million Australian dollars (US$697
million) by Bond unit Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. requires the
asset sale to be completed immediately.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And the A$1.85 billion sale of the company's brewing
assets needs further approval from a meeting of bondholders
in London Aug. 9 and from shareholders in Bell Resources Aug.
15 before it can proceed.
   Under a settlement reached in May, if the sale didn't
proceed by yesterday, Bond Brewing would have until Sept. 30
to repay the banks. If the sale went ahead, Bond Brewing
would have until July 1991 to repay the A$880 million.
   However, the banks were expected to agree to extend the
deadline to await the outcome of the meetings of bondholders
and Bell Resources.
