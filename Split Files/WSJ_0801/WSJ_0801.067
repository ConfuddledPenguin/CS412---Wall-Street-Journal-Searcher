   Siliconix Inc. said AEG Aktiengesellschaft, a subsidiary
of Daimier-Benz AG, agreed to invest $13 million in it and
cancel a $2 million secured note.
   In April, Siliconix filed for reorganization under Chapter
11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The Santa Clara, Calif.,
company, which makes semiconductors, said the accord with the
unit of Daimier-Benz must be approved by the bankruptcy
court.
