   NEW YORK -- Borden Inc. said second-quarter profit rose
7.7%, with strong gains in its pasta and snack businesses
offsetting sharply lower earnings from its dairy operations.
   For the quarter, Borden reported net income of $90.4
million, or 61 cents a share, up from $83.9 million, or 57
cents a share, during the year-earlier period. Sales inched
up to $1.9 billion from $1.88 billion.

   Operating income at Borden's snack and international
consumer products division rose 18%, buoyed by strong results
from the company's U.S. snack business. Borden's Wise brand
of potato chips and popcorn and its Moore's snack unit
reported significant gains, helped by lower potato prices and
manufacturing costs.
   The grocery and specialty products division posted a 17%
gain in operating earnings, driven by strong sales of its
Prince and Creamette brands of pasta in the U.S. and Catelli
pasta in Canada. Sales of its Elmer's and Krazy Glue
adhesives were also up.
   The company also benefited from an 8% decline in its tax
rate during the quarter. A company spokesman attributed the
drop to reduced state and local taxes and to tax benefits
related to dairy restructuring.
   Borden's dairy division, however, had a 35% decline in
operating income as continued weakness in markets for
raw-milk prices cut into earnings.
   "During the quarter, we saw the beginning of a turnaround
in domestic-snack earnings and an improvement in dairy
margins over the first quarter," said R.J. Ventres, Borden's
chairman and chief executive officer. "However, all of our
consumer products markets are becoming increasingly
competitive, and we anticipate sharply higher raw milk costs
this fall."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Borden closed unchanged at $35.625.
