   STOCKHOLM -- Saab Automobile AB, the fledgling joint
venture between General Motors Corp. and Saab-Scania AB,
agreed to begin selling GM's U.S.-built cars, light trucks,
pickups and vans through its Swedish dealer network.
   The move offers GM a national sales base in Sweden in time
to tap an expected surge in pickup and van sales in coming
years. In turn, the addition of GM models could help
beleaguered Swedish dealers plug a gap caused by plunging
sales of new Saabs this year.

   The GM marketing alliance also underlines Saab
Automobile's growing autonomy by thrusting the unit into
head-on competition with its Swedish parent. GM's biggest
rival in Sweden's burgeoning pickup and van market is the
Swedish sales unit of Volkswagen AG -- in which Saab-Scania
owns a controlling 67% stake.
   Saab officials expect to sell about 5,000 GM vehicles --
representing revenue of about one billion Swedish kronor
($170.8 million) -- during the pact's first year. Last year,
GM sold about the same number of vehicles here, directly
imported from the U.S. by less than a dozen independent
dealers.
   In all, Swedes bought about 10,000 new U.S. autos last
year -- a sharp increase in volume compared to the early
1980s when the buoyant dollar effectively priced U.S. gas
guzzlers out of the Swedish market.
