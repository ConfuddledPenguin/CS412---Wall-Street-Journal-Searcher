   Commonwealth Mortgage of America L.P. said it made a
preliminary agreement to sell its mortgage-servicing
operation and $7.2 billion mortgage-servicing portfolio to an
investor group affiliated with Fort Worth, Texas, billionaire
Robert M. Bass. It wouldn't disclose terms.
   Included in the sale is a data-processing center owned by
Commonwealth Federal Savings Association, an insolvent thrift
that owns all the Series I preferred units of limited partner
interests in Commonwealth Mortgage. The thrift is controlled
by the Resolution Trust Corp., a government agency.

   Buyers include Castine Partners Ltd., an affiliate of
Robert M. Bass Group, and Barron Financial Group, a Tustin,
Calif. mortgage bank.
   The proposed sale, part of a planned liquidation of
Commonwealth Mortgage, would strip the company of
"substantially all remaining assets," a spokesman said.
Proceeds will be used to reduce debt, the company said,
adding that holders of the Class A units are unlikely to
receive any liquidating distribution.
   Commonwealth Mortgage said its mortgage-servicing
operation, which services loans nationwide, and its staff of
about 450 will continue to be based in Houston.
