   AUCKLAND, New Zealand -- It was about 1 a.m. on an April
morning when a phone call from his lawyer woke Michael Fay
with bad news. A New York court had just dashed his dream of
possessing the America's Cup and bringing fame and fortune to
Auckland and New Zealand as host of the next regatta.
   The dream had driven the yachting upstart through nearly
three years of legal wrangling, and cost him and his
secretive investment bank, Fay, Richwhite Holdings Ltd., tens
of millions of dollars. A chunk of the money went to
constructing the New Zealand, the biggest racing yacht built
in 50 years.

   Come 1992, the dogged New Zealander, who confesses to
becoming queasy on sailboats, will be at it again with
another boat. Why? "Unfinished business," he says. This time
he'll be mounting the challenge as Sir Michael, having been
knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in June "for services to
merchant banking and yachting."
   The 41-year-old investment banker has challenges ahead on
land as well as at sea. He and his partner, David Richwhite,
are in the midst of a controversial plan to sell their
closely held banking interests to a publicly listed
subsidiary in New Zealand. The proposal set off a storm of
criticism over the amount the two entrepreneurs are demanding
for their holding.
   The plan to sell Fay Richwhite's investment-banking
operations to its 63%-owned finance subsidiary, Capital
Markets Ltd., is aimed at "positioning" the bank for the next
decade, Sir Michael says. Fay Richwhite has operated "very
successfully for 16 years, but there's a limit to what you
can do as a private company," he adds.
   The son of an insurance executive, Sir Michael founded
what later became Fay Richwhite in 1974 with less than 5,000
New Zealand dollars (US$2,955) and an overdraft. His career
path included stints as a sheepshearer and truck driver. In
college, where he earned a reputation for partying, he
operated New Zealand's first mobile disco.
   Still, he got a law degree and practiced for five months
before trying work in a local bank. But he was soon fired for
being a "disruptive influence" after suggesting the bank's
senior management was incompetent. (The bank, he notes with a
smirk, has since folded.)
   Within days, he had set up shop in Auckland and attracted
a former bank colleague and accountant, Mr. Richwhite, now 42
years old, to join him.
   Besides investment-banking operations in New Zealand,
Australia and London, Fay Richwhite controls, through its
Capital Markets unit, 29.5% of Bank of New Zealand, a major
commercial bank. It acquired the stake last year for NZ$300
million; the government retains 51%, and the rest is publicly
traded. In June, Fay Richwhite agreed to take a small stake
in Telecom Corp., the state-owned telephone company that was
sold for NZ$4.25 billion to a consortium led by Ameritech and
Bell Atlantic Corp., both U.S. regional telephone concerns.
Fay Richwhite also acted as a consortium adviser on the
arrangement, the country's biggest commercial transaction.
   In the past five years, the two founders have allowed
three young New Zealand men to buy into the partnership, but
Sir Michael and Mr. Richwhite retain control of about 75% of
the company.
   Insiders say Fay Richwhite really blossomed when New
Zealand's Labor Party government deregulated the financial
markets in the mid-1980s. "We seemed to excel in that
process," says William Birnie, a partner who manages the
firm's Wellington offices. "We were young. We were working
longer hours. We had 7:30 breakfasts. We didn't go out for
lunch. . . . People laughed about this."
   The bank shunned making loans and instead focused on such
areas as trading domestic bonds and financial futures and
fee-income transactions including arranging finance for
clients in ways that minimize tax. The corporate culture is
still one of early staff meetings and late evenings, hard
work, company-provided meals -- and high-class entertainment,
such as a blacktie dinner the Wellington office recently
threw for 120 top clients, using the in-house chef.
   Like the two founding partners, most of Fay Richwhite's
220-member office staff are either lawyers or accountants.
The partners sit at plain tables on the trading floor
surrounded by their respective teams. Sir Michael and Mr.
Richwhite also have posh offices in their pink-granite and
glass Auckland headquarters equipped with massive desks hewn
from North African rock so "we can look the part," Sir
Michael says. The stone is flecked with the fossils of tiny
prehistoric creatures -- but there isn't so much as a paper
clip on either desk.
   Competitors say Fay Richwhite is variously: shrewd and
arrogant; aggressive and expensive; flexible and flashy --
down to its glossy brochures -- but furtive; long on
marketing hype but sometimes short on performance.
   The bank expanded in 1983 to Australia, where it has a
reputation for attracting bright staff. Jim Tate, who heads
the national fixed-interest department at Westpac Banking
Corp. in Sydney, says that while he regards Fay Richwhite as
"quite a capable" participant in the local markets, in some
circles the firm has "always had a smell they are a
fly-by-night."
   Mark Dunphy, a partner who heads the Australian
operations, says the bank has made money in Australia every
year since 1983, and Sir Michael says Australia now generates
more profit than New Zealand, where he claims Fay Richwhite
is the No. 1 investment bank in terms of "market
penetration." (Competitors dispute the claim, noting that the
point is difficult to quantify.)
   Critics and supporters alike agree that, from all
appearances, Fay Richwhite is highly profitable and has made
its owners two of the richest men in New Zealand. Sir Michael
won't talk about his personal wealth, which the country's
National Business Review newspaper puts at a minimum of
NZ$170 million.
   Because the figures are so closely guarded, few people had
any idea how profitable Fay Richwhite's investment-banking
operations were until April, when the company disclosed its
banking-related profits as part of the proposed merger.
According to the figures, those operations earned an average
annual pretax profit of NZ$38 million in the past four years,
peaking at NZ$52 million in 1988. Fay Richwhite projects
pretax profit for the year ending March 31, 1991, at NZ$42.8
million.
   Sir Michael describes his bank as "pretty conservative"
and "risk averse." But competitors and others say the firm
has run a high-risk profile over the years, particularly by
taking equity stakes in projects. That willingness
"differentiates them from people who either aren't able to do
it or won't" invest, says Andrew Meehan, chief executive of
Southpac Corp., one of Fay Richwhite's biggest rivals in New
Zealand.
   Meanwhile, Sir Michael is plotting his next run at the
America's Cup. Although a nation of yachtsmen, New Zealand
didn't pay much attention to the America's Cup until
Australia's Alan Bond won it away from the Americans in 1983
for the first time in its 132-year history.
   "Once it was in Australia, it was just too much to believe
that New Zealand wouldn't have a go" at it, Sir Michael says.
With him at the helm, the nation came tantalizingly close in
its maiden run at the 1987 races in Perth.
   Shortly after the 1987 races, won by the San Diego Yacht
Club, Sir Michael challenged San Diego to a race -- with
giant yachts. San Diego declined. That led to a legal fray
over the interpretation of the rules governing America's Cup
races and eventually to San Diego beating Sir Michael's big
boat with a catamaran. Sir Michael cried mismatch and got a
U.S. court to agree to give him the cup. After a series of
appeals, it all ended in late April when San Diego was
declared the rightful holder of the cup.
