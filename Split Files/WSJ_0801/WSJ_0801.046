   German ophthalmologists reported they had successfully
corrected near-sightedness in 10 of 13 patients by
"sculpturing" their eyes with an American-made laser.
   The eye researchers called the eye sculpturing a success
if the patient was able to see without eye glasses at least
as well as he or she did with glasses before the laser
treatment.

   The German scientists, from the Charlottenburg Clinic in
Berlin, are the first to report the results of laser eye
sculpturing in near-sighted patients although there have been
previous reports of tests of the technique in blind patients.
They reported the results in the May/June issue of Refractive
&amp; Corneal Surgery, an American medical journal.
   Copies of the medical journal article were distributed to
reporters by Summit Technology Inc., Watertown, Mass., which
made the ultraviolet excimer laser used at the Berlin clinic.
Summit is in a race with two other small U.S. laser makers to
bring to market excimer lasers that can correct
near-sightedness and far-sightedness. The two competitors,
Taunton Technologies Inc. in Monroe, Conn., and VisX in
Sunnyvale, Calif., recently agreed to end a protracted patent
dispute and to merge.
   The lasers are designed to reshape the cornea of the eye
in a fraction of a second, flattening it to correct
near-sightedness or increasing the curvature to correct
farsightedness. To do this, the lasers can almost instantly
vaporize layers of the cornea less than a millionth of an
inch thick.
   Theo Seiler and his colleagues at the Berlin clinic
reported the results of laser sculpturing on eight women and
five men, aged 26 to 48 years, who had varying degrees of
near-sightedness. They said the results six to eight months
after treatment were equal to or better than those achieved
with radial keratotomy, in which the cornea is surgically
flattened by cutting tiny radial slits around the edges of
the cornea.
   Six months after treatment the degree of near-sightedness
was reduced in all 13 patients, but in three the correction
fell short of the correction afforded by eye glasses. This
undercorrection was deliberate in two of these patients who
decided not to risk an overcorrection that would have made
them somewhat far-sighted. Hence, in only one patient did the
technique fall short of expectations.
   All the patients had an ache and a feeling of a foreign
body in the treated eye for 24 to 36 hours after the laser
treatment, the researchers reported. Glare was a common
problem for about two weeks afterwards and two patients
reported having "ghost images" in their eyes for about two
weeks.
   The eye doctors said they could see a haze in the eyes of
the treated patients during the first three months after
treatment but the haze gradually cleared up in the subsequent
three months.
   The main problem was predicting the degree of correction.
The researchers deliberately sculptured the corneas to
produce initially a degree of far-sightedness. As expected,
the corneas moved toward near-sightedness as they healed. The
rate at which this happened was slowed by medications to
prevent scarring. In three cases, the medication was stopped
to permit sufficient compensation for the deliberate
overcorrection, a move that proved successful.
   "In the present series of eyes, the predictability {of the
degree of correction} was good but not excellent," Dr. Seiler
and his associates reported. Results should improve with
experience, they said.
