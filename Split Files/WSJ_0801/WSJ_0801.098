   Boeing Co., Seattle, said a subsidiary plans to make a $20
million cash tender offer to acquire UTL Corp., a
Dallas-based designer and maker of electronic warfare
systems.
   Boeing said its $4.75-a-share offer, which will begin by
Monday, has been approved by the boards of UTL and Boeing's
ARGO Systems unit in Sunnyvale, Calif. The offer is subject
to certain conditions, including the tender of at least a
majority of UTL's 4.2 million shares outstanding, Boeing
said.

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, UTL shares
rose $1.25, to close at $4.625. Boeing shares fell 87.5
cents, to close at $57.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.
   A UTL spokesman said that Boeing, which currently accounts
for about 40% of UTL's backlog, is one of the company's four
major customers. UTL supplies systems used for reconnaissance
and surveillance by Boeing's Airborne Warning and Control
System aircraft, better known as AWACS.
   "By including UTL in the Boeing operating structure, we
will significantly improve our ability to meet schedule and
performance commitments to our national and international
military customers," said Dan Pinick, president of Boeing's
Boeing Defense &amp; Space Group.
