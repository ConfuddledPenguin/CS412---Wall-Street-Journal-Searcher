   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. unveiled preliminary
plans for its third major U.S. theme park development, "Port
Disney," a proposed $2.3 billion waterfront resort in this
city of 400,000, 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.
   The development, which Disney says it will build only if
it can cut the right deal with government officials, would
include five hotels with nearly 4,000 rooms, a
retail/entertainment center and a theme park to be called
"DisneySea," centered on a cluster of futuristic bubbles
called "Oceana."
   The plans include a whole new set of creations from
Disney's "Imagineering" unit, with names such as Mysterious
Island, Pirate Island, Nemo's Lava Cruiser and Heroes'
Harbor. The complex would include the world's largest
aquarium, a Caribbean lagoon, a Grecian village and an Asian
floating market. Guests would be lowered in a steel cage into
a tank full of sharks.
   The plan, laid out in a 70-page booklet and submitted to
meet two deadlines on options on city land, also includes a
waterfront promenade, a "port" with ferry service and harbor
excursions, a marina and public parkland, and marine research
facilities.
   But negotiations with bevies of city, state and federal
officials are yet to come, and Disney is coyly saying it
might not go to Long Beach at all but instead build a second
gated attraction 15 miles away in Anaheim, adjacent to
Disneyland.
   As if to remind Long Beach officials that "Port Disney"
isn't a foregone conclusion, a report surfaced over the
weekend that an Anaheim plan being readied for next year
includes among its concepts a theme park similar to Epcot
Center, part of Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla.
   "We have not yet begun discussions about how to structure
the financial arrangements," said Alan G. Epstein, Disney
Development Co. vice president. Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner said in January that the company would build one new
attraction, not both. "It depends which community wants us
more," he said.
   Disney will begin "community briefings" on the plan this
month, but so far no organized opposition seems to have
emerged. The complex could attract 10 million visitors in its
first year, Mr. Epstein said.
   Once a seedy Navy town with peep shows and tattoo parlors,
Long Beach is newly fat with Japanese development money,
drawn by a seaside location fit snugly between the Los
Angeles basin and Orange County. The port of Long Beach is
part of the nation's largest port complex.
   Nevertheless, the city still hopes Disney will help bail
it out of a host of urban problems: a dearth of popular
retail complexes (the city has no major shopping mall) and
the resulting weak sales tax revenue, sprawling low income
neighborhoods full of drugs and crime, the challenge of
integrating a burgeoning community of new immigrants,
including the largest Cambodian population outside Cambodia,
and declining income from city-owned oil wells.
   Traffic may be one of the major incentives for Disney to
come to Long Beach rather than to Anaheim: Disneyland is
located near heavily trafficked thoroughfares, whereas the
Long Beach Freeway is one of the least-used freeways in the
Los Angeles area. Even so, the plan requires that two lanes
be added to it. The plan also calls for the sewer system to
be expanded, natural gas pipelines upgraded, and other
infrastructure improvements.
   Long Beach port officials said the permitting and review
process is expected to take two years to complete. Then, up
to 250 acres of landfill would have to be constructed, which
would take another three years, Mr. Epstein said. In all, it
would be "at least 10 years" before the complex would be open
to the public.
   By owning hotels and operating a retail complex in Long
Beach, Disney would avoid the situation in Anaheim that still
galls it: Because it didn't own the land surrounding
Disneyland, independent motels and souvenir shops sprouted
like weeds around the park. On its 28,000 acres in Florida,
Disney urges visitors to buy a four-day pass and never leave
the grounds.
   Anaheim, however, is "optimistic" about winning a new
Disney park, said City Manager James Ruth. "We've had a
35-year working relationship with Disney which has been very
productive for both of us," he said. "We've demonstrated an
ability to manage tourism."
   Disney gained a foothold in Long Beach when it bought the
72% of Wrather Corp. it didn't already own in two
transactions for about $200 million in 1987. They included
the lease on the Queen Mary and the Spruce Goose, Howard
Hughes's massive flying boat, both of which are tourist
attractions in Long Beach.
   In Disney's proposed park, the fate of the Queen Mary,
currently operated as a tour and hotel, is up in the air. The
Spruce Goose isn't included in Disney's plans.
