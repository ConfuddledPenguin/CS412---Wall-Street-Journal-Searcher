   NEW YORK -- GPU Nuclear Corp. said it will pay a $50,000
fine imposed by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for
a 1987 incident in which a control room shift supervisor at a
Three Mile Island nuclear reactor unit was found sleeping on
duty.
   The utility, a subsidiary of General Public Utilities
Corp., Parsippany, N.J., said the NRC confirmed the findings
of a 1987 company investigation that led to the dismissal of
the shift supervisor.

   Although the commission said its investigation found that
prompt and thorough action was taken by the company to
prevent a recurrence, it levied the fine because the incident
wasn't dealt with adequately by site managers.
   The company said a site manager, who was slow to act and
allowed the shift supervisor's behavior to go uncorrected for
months, was dismissed.
   The company said an internal investigation began after
people at the unit sent anonymous notes to top managers
accusing the shift supervisor of sleeping on the job.
   The utility said the incident occurred while damaged fuel
was being removed from the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor
vessel. That work was completed last January, the company
said.
   In 1979, a reactor cooling system failed, allowing
radioactive water to flood the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant near Harrisburg, Pa. It was one of the nation's
worst nuclear power plant accidents.
