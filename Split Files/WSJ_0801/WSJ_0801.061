   Kenichi Ohmae's "The Borderless World: Power and Strategy
in the Interlinked Economy" (Harper Business, 224 pages,
$21.95) contains insight and guidance for anyone engaged in
business. To understand the global economy accurately, he
argues, we must come to understand that national borders are
almost disappearing, never mind the eager preservationist
efforts of bureaucrats, politicians and the military.
   Economic policies based on conventional macroeconomic
statistics that compare one nation with another are outmoded,
Mr. Ohmae argues. Instead he proposes that we think in terms
of an Interlinked Economy (ILE), in which the U.S., Europe
and Japan are dominant, joined by Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore.

   Mr. Ohmae, the managing director of McKinsey &amp; Co. in
Japan, discusses a wide range of topics in his short, very
readable book. One chapter, for instance, is devoted to the
"equidistant manager." Ideally, such a manager no longer
distinguishes between home and overseas markets, but views
all key customers as important and thus equidistant from the
corporate center. In another, he critiques the time-worn
notion that beating the competition should be a primary
strategic tool.
   "Of course, it is important to take the competition into
account," writes Mr. Ohmae, "but that should not come first
in making strategy. First comes painstaking attention to the
needs of customers and close analysis of a company's real
degrees of freedom in responding to those needs."
   Amen to that] In fact, a concerted attempt to do just that
underlay the major Ford Motor Co. efforts of the 1980s.
Before that, our halls echoed with the old theme song: "Beat
Chevrolet]"
   Mr. Ohmae offers Japanese examples to make his point that
you are on the wrong track if all you are thinking about is
competition. I especially liked his discussion of how the
Japanese toiletry company, Kao, took the old Japanese bath
gel and additives industry to the cleaners. Instead of
competing with already existing products for the home bath
market, Kao came up with Babu, which looks like a jumbo Alka
Seltzer tablet and, once plopped into the bath, duplicates
the effect of a Japanese hot spring.
   Know your customer is a frequent refrain; spend money on
R&amp;D its obvious corollary. It seems to me that Mr. Ohmae
could have made an added point -- the importance of having
strong technical people at the top of a company. They know
the product. Still, readers no doubt will be intrigued by
some of the stories he tells from his own experiences as a
consultant. Don't rely exclusively on surveys; talk to the
customers, he says in an amusing chapter, "Brewing Wisdom,"
which describes the search for the perfect percolator.
   The book describes equally well the dangers of driving
profit out of an industry by what he calls excessive
companyism and the often detrimental role accounting systems
play in determining how managers will behave. "When nothing
else gets measured or rewarded, managers will blindly strive
to do more better." But more is not often better.
   He writes intelligently about the obsession with control,
to make the point that people often are very unwilling to do
the key thing that must be done when entering into a global
alliance: Give up some control and extend trust to your
partners.
   Still, when one considers how closed Japan has been for
most of its history and how difficult it still is in many
instances to gain entry into the Japanese economy, Mr.
Ohmae's examples of American or European reluctance to let in
Japanese investors ring a bit hollow. He says little of
significance on the subject of equity, other than saying an
obsession with it is dangerous.
   Even now, many Japanese companies continue their longtime
habits of focusing on themselves, never mind the effect this
may have on the profitability of the entire industry. Indeed,
someone from the auto industry might easily argue that
present overcapacity in world markets is proof of myopic
thinking. Mr. Ohmae's borderless world still is partly in the
future.
   To his credit, he often cites the Japanese government as
an obstacle to the smooth interflow of goods and ideas. For
instance, it protects the turf of Japan's drug industry by
forcing foreign drugs to undergo five years of retesting.
"Governments," he argues, "must move to a modern system that
stresses giving people as much choice as possible to keep
them well informed so they are capable of making a choice.
Government's role in a borderless world, then, is to
represent and protect the interests of its people, not of its
companies or its industries."
   "The Borderless World" contains much wisdom, questions and
issues that must be debated more extensively (for instance,
jobs and job security, the lack of a common currency,
floating exchange rates, and just what kind of an impact an
interlinked economy will have on the various segments within
it). But all in all, Mr. Ohmae has made a major contribution
to contemporary thought about the world economy.
