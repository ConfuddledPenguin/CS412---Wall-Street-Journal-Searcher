   Allianz AG said in Munich that consolidated net group
profit totaled 1.16 billion marks ($698 million) in 1989.
   This is the first time the West German insurance company
has published consolidated group earnings, so year-earlier
figures weren't available.

   Allianz said that, of the 1.16 billion marks, 460 million
marks of profit came from its foreign operations. Based on
available data, Allianz's 1989 domestic group net profit thus
climbed 32% to 700 million marks from 529 million a year
earlier.
   World-wide group premium income jumped 8.9% to 31.8
billion marks from 29.2 billion, Allianz said. It added that
it expects 1990 premium income to rise further, to about 36
billion marks.
   Allianz said it expects earnings to be "satisfactory" in
1990. Current earnings levels are running according to plans,
the company said.
