   Some retirees serve on boards;
   Some pursue active hobbies;
   Some retirees do volunteer work;
   Some join political lobbies.
   Some retirees attend reunions
   At companies where they were hired;
   (The frantic pace of some retirees
   Simply makes me tired])
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   The Annual Meeting
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was high against the yen;
   Parts were delivered late;
   There was pressure on our profits again,
   But everything is great.
   -- Richard F. Barrett.
