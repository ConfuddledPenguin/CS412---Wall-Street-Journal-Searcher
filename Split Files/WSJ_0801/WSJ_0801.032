   CINCINNATI -- Procter &amp; Gamble Co. is considering a $200
million expansion of its century-old Ivorydale plant near
this city.
   P&amp;G officials say the soap and detergent plant is one of
several midwestern U.S. plants that could be expanded as part
of its restructuring.

   Local officials expect the expansion following the
Cincinnati consumer products company's request for a property
tax abatement on $200 million in plant improvements.
   P&amp;G yesterday won a 75% property tax abatement for new
buildings and machinery at the site. The abatement could save
P&amp;G up to $15 million in taxes over 10 years, said David
Main, executive director of Hamilton County Development Co.,
the county's economic development agency.
   A spokeswoman for P&amp;G said the abatement makes the
Ivorydale site competitive with other locations, but
expansion plans aren't official because "there are several
projects under consideration."
   Other P&amp;G sites that could be expanded include laundry and
cleaning products plants in Alexandria, La., and Augusta,
Ga., or a peanut-butter plant in Lexington, Ky. P&amp;G could
choose to build a plant at another site, according to a
company spokeswoman.
   It's unclear whether the Ivorydale expansion will include
new products or simply shift production from other plants
that P&amp;G plans to close.
   For instance, P&amp;G has announced plans to close its Port
Ivory plant in Staten Island, N.Y. That plant employs 425
people and makes soaps, detergents and cleaners.
