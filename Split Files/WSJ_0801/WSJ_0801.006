   Because of the savings-and-loan disaster, it rains in
Clarice Leunzman's living room.
   Three years ago, Ms. Leunzman retired and started a new
life in a condominium in Cotati, Calif. She reported the
condensation problem to the condo's developer, but he went
broke before he fixed it. His lender, Atlas Savings &amp; Loan,
foreclosed on the project, but then it, too, went belly up.
It was acquired by another S&amp;L, Empire of America. Ms.
Leunzman barely raised an eyebrow when Empire was taken over
by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Before it
could make repairs, even the federal agency disappeared,
wiped out by last year's thrift-bailout law.

   Now the condo is in the hands of another government
agency, and the living room is still wet. "This really says a
lot about our nation," Ms. Leunzman says glumly. "I hope this
doesn't continue into the '90s."
   In fact, it will continue into the next century. The S&amp;L
bomb has exploded, and the fallout has begun raining from
coast to coast.
   Partly because of the stupefying cost of the bailout
(which even by conservative estimates exceeds $130 billion,
without interest), the new restrictions mandated by the
bailout law, and the regulatory crackdown that is following
it, real estate isn't selling, business loans are shrinking
and local taxes are rising.
   "There's a sense that, my God, that black hole is so much
deeper than we realized, and it could really have some
effects," says George Iden, an economist at the Congressional
Budget Office.
   Not all of the effects of the S&amp;L mess are yet visible.
But already it is clear that the disaster will reach into the
life of almost every American. Here is a survey of some the
major effects that are appearing now across the country:
                                                                                                       

   THE ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   Just as the thrift buildup helped fuel the go-go '80s, the
S&amp;L collapse is helping usher in the go-slow '90s.
   It's generally recognized that Reagan-era deficit spending
helped fuel the expansion. It's less often realized that
freewheeling S&amp;L spending, using deposits guaranteed by the
government, also pumped billions of dollars into the economy.
   "It was an integral part of the boom that was occurring,"
says Martin Regalia, a former Federal Reserve economist now
with the National Council of Savings Institutions, a thrift
trade group. Every white-elephant office building put up by a
thrift in Dallas employed construction workers who in turn
bought new cars. "A lot of the expansion was artificial,
created partly by law and regulatory whim."
   Now, in an uncharacteristic fit of prudence, the
government wants to settle up the budget deficit and S&amp;L
losses all at once. That means Americans could pay higher
prices for beer, cigarettes and gasoline as the Bush
administration and Congress go after the easy revenue
targets. A tax on the sale of stock is possible, too.
   Cuts in spending also loom. Federal aid to cities and
states is likely to be one of the first programs to be
shaved.
   Local governments may compensate by boosting their own
taxes. With real-estate prices being hammered, the city of
Austin, Texas, already has seen its tax receipts fall to $101
million from $144 million, even after a steep property-tax
increase. "Over the next year," says Mayor Lee Cooke, "I
believe you will see a flood of concerns and anger by folks
like me."
   Moreover, some economists argue, the bailout is a transfer
of cash to the wealthy from the less-so. Not everyone in the
U.S. holds savings, so by bailing out S&amp;L depositors, the
general populace is footing the bill for a smaller group
that, by definition, is wealthier than average. Many of those
depositors were holders of big certificates of deposit who
chased the above-market rates offered by insolvent thrifts.
   "If one were honest, this probably works against the less
wealthy," says James Barth, a former thrift-agency economist
now at Auburn University.
                                                                                                       

   THE CREDIT CRUNCH
                                                                                                       

   Five years ago, S&amp;Ls doled out loans to just about anyone.
That's over. Now builders can't get loans, and housing starts
are down for the fifth straight month. A shortage of
low-income housing threatens to become a major issue in the
1990s. To be sure, a real-estate slump in parts of the
country and a weaker economy have also hurt the availability
of credit, prompting Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
to ease interest rates.
   Shaken by the thrift debacle, regulators are forcing
thrifts and banks to suddenly ante up more equity, or
capital. But the regulators also are forcing them to set
aside more reserves from profit, even for on-time loans to
solvent parties. Second National Bank, Annapolis, Md.,
already has a hearty capital base, but its president, Henry
Berliner, still is doubling reserves for the "performing
nonperforming" loans. Satisfying the regulators' new appetite
for reserves, he estimates, will trim about $1 million from
Second National's earnings next year.
   Norman Flynn, president of the National Association of
Realtors, complains that "banks are under such regulatory
paranoia that they won't touch real estate or construction."
   In Owensboro, Ky., banker William Spurrier wants to lend
$22 million to Tommy Thompson of Thompson Homes Inc., a
reliable construction borrower for 42 years. The
thrift-bailout law says he can't: It places limits on the
amount he can lend to any single borrower. So Mr. Thompson's
160-house development is on hold.
   William Sinclair, president of Washington Federal Savings
made a big loan for the construction of 123 houses on the
Potomac River. Loan repayments are on schedule, and 114 of
the houses are finished. Nonetheless, unless he sells an
interest in the loan, he must foreclose on the builder: The
loan exceeds by $1.3 million what he is permitted to lend
under the new law.
   After he forecloses on the builder, Robert Mitchell, he
plans to hire him to complete construction. "Who better to
finish the project?" asks Mr. Sinclair.
                                                                                                       

   INSIDE THE BELTWAY
                                                                                                       

   For the longest time, the S&amp;L disaster hovered like a big,
black cloud on the Washington horizon. Now the storm has
broken. Partly because of the thrift troubles, George Bush
has reneged on his no-new-taxes promise, the central theme of
his 1988 campaign. If the economy sours, the S&amp;L problem will
loom even larger over his 1992 re-election effort. Meanwhile,
his son Neil has become a national symbol of the thrift mess
for his role in the $1 billion collapse of a Denver thrift,
where he was a director. And congressional Democrats, putting
aside their own role in creating the mess, now are trying to
lay the botched bailout at the president's feet.
   But the storm is still new. The most startling fact about
the S&amp;L crisis may be just how little effect it has had so
far in Washington. For all the fuss about the "Keating Five"
senators who intervened with regulators on behalf of an S&amp;L
executive who made big campaign contributions, life on
Capitol Hill has changed very little. No sweeping laws have
been passed to revamp campaign finance. And many in Congress
are still happy to accept donations from S&amp;L executives.
   GOP Sen. Phil Gramm should be in a position to judge the
effects of the S&amp;L mess. He's from Texas, the black hole of
S&amp;L money. And he is a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, home to some of the legislation that deregulated
the thrift industry, and to two of the Keating Five. But when
asked for evidence that Congress has been embarrassed by the
S&amp;L mess, he points only to an obscure amendment on a housing
bill to increase premiums on government-backed mortgages
that, despite opposition from the housing industry, passed.
   "We would never have been able to pass that before the S&amp;L
problem," says the Texas Republican.
