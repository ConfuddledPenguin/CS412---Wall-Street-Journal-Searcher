   PARIS -- Executives at French nuclear power plant builder
Framatome said the long-running wrangle between shareholders
is seriously hindering the group. But, they said, the dispute
should be resolved by early September.
   Company officials also threw a new element into the debate
by calling for Framatome's one-time rival Schneider S.A. to
take a 20% stake in the company to counter the unwelcome
presence of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, or CGE.

   Framatome has been the focus of a dispute between the
state and the private sector since CGE agreed last March to
buy construction group Dumez Group's 12% stake in the
company, thereby raising its own stake to 52%. State-owned
firms and Framatome's employees own the remaining 48% of the
group's capital.
   France depends heavily on nuclear power, and so CGE's move
drew opposition from President Francois Mitterrand and the
governing Socialist Party, neither of whom wanted to see such
a strategic industry pass out of the public sector. They
asked CGE to cut its stake to less than 50%.
   Marcel Chabrillac, Framatome's director for nuclear
engineering, sharply attacked CGE yesterday. "CGE has never
brought us anything. It has just taken its dividends. . . .
For some of its shareholders, Framatome is nothing more than
a cash cow," he said.
   Mr. Chabrillac also said that the uncertainty over the
group's future had held up its plans to develop new business,
especially in the U.S. and in China.
   A CGE official said later that the company was willing to
discuss cutting its stake, but he declined to give further
details.
   A Schneider official said an alliance between the
engineering group and Framatome was sound industrial logic
because the two companies already worked together on many
nuclear plant projects.
   But officials at Schneider and Framatome said several
tricky details remained to be resolved: Both Schneider and
CGE are reluctant to share a role in Framatome with the
other; a price has to be set for any Framatome shares that
CGE sells. And the government, a key player in the
negotiations, is unlikely to smile on Schneider's entry into
Framatome.
