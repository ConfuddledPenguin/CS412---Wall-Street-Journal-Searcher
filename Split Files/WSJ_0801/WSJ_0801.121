   NEW YORK -- F.A.O. Schwarz has a new owner again -- the
sixth since the founding family sold the famous toy-store
chain in 1963.
   Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer N.V., Amsterdam, purchased
the 17-store chain from an investor group led by the
Philadelphia investment banker Peter Morse. That group had
acquired F.A.O. Schwarz in 1985 and engineered its current
recovery.

   Terms of the latest sale weren't disclosed, but an
industry executive estimated the price at about $40 million,
nearly four times what the Morse group paid in 1985. F.A.O.
Schwarz said its sales will exceed $50 million this year.
   The transaction won't change the way F.A.O. Schwarz
operates, said Peter Harris, its chief executive officer. The
current management team will continue to operate
independently, he said, but "KBB's financial strength will
give F.A.O. new capital to grow and fuel its expansion into
Europe."
   The purchase of F.A.O. Schwarz gives KBB, a Dutch retail
conglomerate with sales of $2.2 billion in 1989, its first
major acquisition in the U.S. The high-end retailing business
is a niche that has proved extremely attractive to foreign
buyers. Investcorp International Inc., a partnership of
Arabian investors, recently purchased Saks Fifth Avenue for
about $1.5 billion. Investcorp earlier had made more than
$100 million in profit buying and selling Tiffany &amp; Co.
   "The acquisition gives F.A.O. access to KBB's capital and
international expertise," says Carol Farmer, a Boca Raton,
Fla., industry consultant who helped put the deal together.
"In return KBB has acquired a premier brand name in the
selling of toys and gifts," she says.
   When Mr. Morse and the investor group purchased F.A.O.
Schwarz in 1985, the 123-year-old company had lost much of
its glitter. With sales of only $20 million a year, and with
many of the stores in poor locations, F.A.O. Schwarz was
losing money.
   The new investors closed down some of the unprofitable
stores, moved the company's New York flagship store to a
larger location and opened a giant new store in San
Francisco. They also revitalized the company's catalog
operations and added a new line of products sold by mail. The
changes were instrumental in attracting about $7 million in
new capital from such venture capitalists as Prudential
Venture Partners, New York, and Boston's Charles River
Ventures. By the end of last year, sales at F.A.O. Schwarz
had more than doubled from 1985 and the company was highly
profitable, the company says.
   Frederick August Otto Schwarz, an immigrant from Germany,
opened the first Schwarz store in 1862, in Baltimore. After
running the company profitably for more than a century his
family sold it in 1963. The company then had a succession of
owners, including Parents Magazine Inc., W.R. Grace &amp; Co.,
and Christiana Cos., a San Diego real estate and specialty
retailer.
