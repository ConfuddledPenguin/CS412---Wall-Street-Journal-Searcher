   WASHINGTON -- The House, anticipating voter anger over the
expanding savings-and-loan mess, overwhelmingly approved
legislation aimed at invigorating the investigation and
prosecution of thrift-related crime.
   The bill, which passed 424-4, would increase maximum
prison terms for S&amp;L offenses and would make it a federal
crime to conceal assets from the receiver of a failed thrift
or to obstruct a government examiner. The legislation also
would authorize greatly increased funding over the next three
years to hire hundreds of additional investigators and
prosecutors specifically to handle fraud cases involving
financial institutions.

   The bill includes provisions that would vastly expand the
government's civil authority to freeze or take over assets of
those suspected of S&amp;L fraud.
   Focusing on the imminent summer recess and election-year
constituent meetings, representative after representative
rose to declare that the bill would help "put the S&amp;L crooks
in jail."
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who caught some of his
colleagues by surprise when he hastily introduced the measure
under a suspension of normal House procedures, called it "an
effective blueprint" to "bring S&amp;L criminals to justice."
   In fact, none of the bill's criminal provisions would
apply retroactively. That means that the increased prison
terms and new categories of federal crimes couldn't be used
against anyone associated with the S&amp;L debacle of the 1980s.
Moreover, the bill would create redundant criminal statutes
covering acts already prosecutable under existing law,
according to Justice Department officials and defense
lawyers.
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), one of the four
dissenters in the vote, complained that the measure hadn't
been sufficiently debated and was being rushed through the
House because of "election-year fears." Lawmakers, he
contended, "are very zealously eager to prove that we want to
get these crooks in jail."
   The Senate has approved S&amp;L-related enforcement provisions
with goals similar to those of the House bill but some
differences in the mechanics. The Bush administration has
backed some of the congressional proposals but strongly
opposes a provision in the House bill that would create a
bipartisan investigative commission to study the causes of
the thrift crisis.
