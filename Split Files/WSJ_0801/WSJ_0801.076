million videocassette recorders in the first half of 1990, up

   For June, about 2.2 million VCRs were exported, up 13%
from a year earlier.
   VCR exports to the U.S. posted sharp year-to-year declines
both in June and in the first half, an association official
said. Despite the decline, the U.S. remained by far the
biggest importer of Japanese VCRs.
   The U.S. imported 657,849 VCRs in June, down 28% from the
year before, while imports for the January-June period
declined 26% to 3.7 million.
