   NEW YORK -- If liberal Protestantism had a Vatican,
Riverside Church would be its St. Peter's. Perched
cathedral-like on the high ground between Manhattan's Harlem
and Upper West Side, Riverside since its founding nearly 60
years ago has been committed to what once was known as the
"Social Gospel."
   During the 1930s, Riverside's famous pastor, the Rev.
Harry Emerson Fosdick, exhorted millions of American families
via network radio to "work together in unheavenly places" to
help the poor and needy. During the late 1970s and the 1980s,
William Sloane Coffin made the church a center of protest
against racism, militarism and nuclear weaponry.

   Today, non-denominational Riverside and the movement it
represents have fallen on hard times.
   Liberal white Protestants -- among them Presbyterians,
Episcopalians and Methodists, who dominated the nation's
religious mainstream for much of the 20th century -- now find
themselves short on members and struggling for recognition.
Their voices are all but lost as evangelicals, Roman
Catholics and black Protestants have gained in relative
strength.
   On the surface, little seems to have changed here at
Riverside. In its sanctuary, inspired by Chartres cathedral,
the glow from towering stained glass still softens into a
reverent gloom. The light plays across a chancel screen
carved with 70 Christian heroes from John the Baptist to J.S.
Bach. A nine-ton limestone-block pulpit, carved with the
figures of five prophets, still offers the famous and
powerful one of the most coveted places to speak in
Christendom. Nelson Mandela was the latest of many
dignitaries to take the pulpit.
   But today, instead of a network, a single New York radio
station broadcasts Riverside's taped services -- at 5 a.m. on
Sundays. Debt, inflation and investment losses have shrunk
its endowment, supplied by John D. Rockefeller Jr., from $120
million in the late 1970s to about half that now. Over the
years, most of its richest members have deserted.
   To keep operating, Riverside in 1988 was forced to reduce
its yearly budget by nearly 20% to $6.4 million. It
eventually laid off 40 of its 150 staffers. Last April, a
consultant warned the church that to regain a sound financial
footing it must double its average attendance to 3,000
people, recruit younger members and get more money from
everybody.
   In the view of old-line Riversiders, however, the church's
waning influence nearly dwarfs its money troubles. "The
issues that unified everyone at Riverside in the 1980s have
evaporated," says Donald H. Elliott, a longtime member and
former trustee of the church. Fran Massey, a former deacon,
says a new kind of worshiper with little taste for an
"action-oriented" church is being attracted to Riverside.
"Now, perhaps, we're attracting people who are looking for a
haven," she says. "There's nothing wrong with that -- but
it's not Riverside."
   The most prominent newcomer is Riverside's pastor, the
Rev. James A. Forbes Jr., a Baptist minister highly regarded
in religious circles but little-known outside them. A year
after his appointment, some New York ministers are still
surprised at the choice, in no small part because Riverside
had a tradition of pastoring by Northern whites.
   Mr. Forbes, 54, who was professor of preaching at nearby
Union Theological Seminary, describes himself as a member of
"triple minority" -- a black and a Southerner with roots in
pentecostalism, a tradition that emphasizes intensely
personal religious experience, often through fervent singing,
clapping and speaking in tongues.
   In Mr. Forbes's view, pentecostal fervor -- refined and
intellectualized for middle-class tastes -- could help
re-energize Riverside's social activism. He says he told the
church's search committee last year that he "might have
something which, combined with what was the tradition of this
place, could be a dynamite combination."
   Others at Riverside say they are still waiting for the
explosion. "I just feel we're kind of standing still," says
Ms. Massey. "Jim Forbes has been with us a whole year now,
and we still don't seem to be moving in any particular
direction."
   Such comments reflect the powerful grip that Mr. Coffin's
activism still exerts on Riverside's flock, even though the
former pastor has been gone nearly three years.
   Arriving at the church in 1977, he brought with him a
national reputation for his opposition, as chaplain at Yale
University, to the Vietnam war. In sharp contrast to the
reflective and affable Mr. Forbes, Mr. Coffin is remembered
as spontaneous, abrasive and so audacious that he once opened
a sermon by warning a pair of federal agents that he would
have TV cameras at the church "in 15 minutes" if they
attempted to arrest Guatemalan refugees being sheltered
there. "Bill Coffin was larger than life," says Geoff Martin,
vice chairman of Riverside's council.
   Mr. Coffin's brusqueness and his obsession with politics
at times alienated even his supporters. Still, says the Rev.
Eugene E. Laubach, the church's minister of parish life,
"they loved the fact that he had a national and international
reputation."
   While millions of Americans rallied to the idea of a
nuclear freeze in the early 1980s, Mr. Coffin's Riverside was
squarely in the lead. Hundreds of new members flocked to the
church. But the spotlight faded as the Cold War began to
wane. And in December 1987 Mr. Coffin left to head an
anti-war organization.
   These days, Riverside plays host to a crazy-quilt of
liberal causes. After Sunday services, worshipers taking
coffee and cake in the lounge find themselves encircled by
the information booths of nine different "task forces."
They're pushing boycotts, mounting letter-writing campaigns
on issues from Central America to South Africa, and promoting
black, Hispanic and homosexual causes. There's even a
right-wing group, the Men's Class, a venerable but shadowy
organization that campaigned hard for Mr. Coffin's ouster and
continues to denounce him in its bimonthly newsletter.
   Mr. Forbes acknowledges that somehow he must knit such
groups into a common cause without stifling their creative
impulses. The first step, he says, is the "spiritual
revitalization" in the church. "If the Gospel I am talking
about is true," he says, "it ought to be able to function in
the midst of chaos and confusion, because that's where it's
needed."
   Born in rural North Carolina the son of a minister in the
pentecostal United Holy Church of America, Mr. Forbes
originally set his sights on becoming a physician. He changed
plans while at Howard University, after a series of incidents
that culminated, he says, in his hearing the voice of God
speaking to him through the music of a Tchaikovsky symphony.
   He went on to attend Union Theological Seminary, across
the street from Riverside. After graduation, he returned to
the South, eventually to head a conservative congregation
that he tried to prod into joining the civil-rights movement.
He was arrested during sit-ins -- as he was again this decade
during anti-apartheid demonstrations in New York.
   In June, as he marked his first anniversary in Riverside's
pulpit, Mr. Forbes began sketching out a vast new project for
the church. Urban problems, particularly race relations, are
replacing war and peace as the crucial issues in the 1990s,
he says. Where better to address those questions than at
Riverside, whose members have worked hard since the 1960s to
integrate their church? The once overwhelmingly white
congregation is now almost evenly balanced between whites and
blacks along with smaller Hispanic and Asian minorities.
   Thus, he proposes that Riverside lead a broad effort to
create a "center for the health of the city," a think-tank of
sorts for religious leaders, academics and social activists
to meet and work on New York's problems. He hopes to offer
details to the congregation in October, when Riverside marks
its 60th anniversary.
   This approach seems rather academic, however, to many
Protestant social activists in New York. Black churches in
particular, whose members make up the overwhelming majority
of the city's Protestants, tend to value direct action to
further specific causes. Seventeen blocks north of Riverside,
at historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, the Rev. Calvin O.
Butts III repeatedly risked arrest this year as he led
members of his congregation through central Harlem, painting
over billboards that pitched cigarettes and alcohol to a
community suffering from high rates of cancer and liver
disease.
   "Evil has so gripped this city that God's people -- and
particularly God's prophets -- cannot afford to take a
laid-back, diplomatic style," says Mr. Butts. "We have got to
go in and turn over the tables of Herod."
   Mr. Butts, also a graduate of Union seminary, is
frequently sought out these days by print and television
journalists for his opinion on city issues. Many at Riverside
would like to see Mr. Forbes's words attract the same kind of
attention, says the Rev. Erik Kolbell, an associate minister
at the church. "We want to see Jim emerge as a major
Protestant figure in this city, who will be looked to in the
same way as the cardinal," he says, referring to New York
Roman Catholic archbishop John J. O'Connor, a frequent
newsmaker. But Mr. Kolbell wonders: "How do you market him?
What do you do?"
   At a minimum, some Riverside members say, Mr. Forbes could
spend more time critiquing capitalism than citing Christ.
Sandy Donaldson, the former head of the church's disarmament
program, says she supports Mr. Forbes, but she misses Mr.
Coffin's often overtly political preachings. "I personally
like the politics," she says, "and for me, being politically
active is being spiritually aware." Ms. Massey, the former
deacon, says momentous world events don't seem to find their
way into Mr. Forbes's preaching. "Even when the Berlin Wall
fell, there wasn't a mention of it in the Sunday sermon," she
says.
   Mr. Elliott, the former trustee, says Mr. Forbes is simply
trying to give his congregation a better grounding in the
Bible, out of his belief that social activism is best founded
on a thorough understanding of Scripture. Mr. Forbes,
soft-spoken as always, takes criticism in stride, saying
simply that Riverside gets "nervous when it does not have an
action program." Indeed, twice during the past year, some of
the church's more ardent members have trooped up to his
office to voice anger and worry over Riverside's direction.
   Some of those critics, however, now say they are growing
more comfortable with Mr. Forbes. "Jim is uniquely
compassionate and reflective and pastoral," says Liz
Gonzalez, who helped organize the meetings. "Most of us have
gotten over the idea that change comes overnight."
   Even before troubles beset Riverside, its pastor's role as
the national spokesman for religious liberalism was called
"the toughest job in Protestantism." Now, more so than ever
before, "you have to be really Superman," says Mr. Laubach.
"And even if you are Superman, you may not be able to make
it."
