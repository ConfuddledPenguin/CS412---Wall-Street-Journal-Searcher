   It was a coincidence of constitutional moment that Justice
William Brennan resigned the day a conservative federal
appeals court reversed the convictions of a high-profile
criminal defendant. The judges were guided by the Bill of
Rights, prosecutorial abuses and a legal brief from the ACLU.
That the defendant was Oliver North is a timely reminder that
original-intent jurisprudence, not result-oriented activism,
is the best guarantee of individual rights.
   Mr. North's appeal should have been a no-brainer for
judges. The facts were simple. The Iran-Contra congressional
committee wanted Mr. North to testify in 1987 on live
television. As was his right, Mr. North invoked his Fifth
Amendment freedom from self-incrimination; no claim to any
constitutional penumbras or emanations was needed. As was
Congress's privilege, it forced him to waive his rights in
exchange for immunity from any later prosecution using the
coerced information. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
warned Congress that such "immunity would create serious --
and perhaps insurmountable -- barriers to the prosecution of
the immunized witness."

   The trouble began two years and millions of prosecutorial
dollars ago when Mr. Walsh ignored his own legal analysis and
charged Mr. North anyway. It was clear before trial that the
memories of many witnesses were "refreshed" by Mr. North's
congressional testimony; one, Robert McFarlane, even got a
second round of testimony to Congress to respond to what Mr.
North had said. The American Civil Liberties Union warned,
"there is no conceivable way this case can be tried free of
the taint of the defendants' immunized testimony," that a
trial would "eviscerate the privilege against
self-incrimination" and cause a "gross miscarriage of
justice."
   In more than 200 pages of legal reasoning for the federal
appeals court in Washington, Reagan-appointed Judges Laurence
Silberman and David Sentelle agreed with the ACLU, while
Carter-appointed Judge Patricia Wald dissented. The court
vacated the convictions pending a hearing "witness-by-witness
. . . line-by-line and item-by-item." Trial Judge Gerhard
Gesell already has said many witnesses were hopelessly
tainted. The appellate opinion stressed that the Fifth
Amendment means the "government must occasionally decide
which it values more: immunization (perhaps to discharge
institutional duties, such as congressional fact-finding and
information dissemination) or prosecution."
   Mr. Walsh may decide to appeal, but the reversal of the
most famous criminal conviction in years and most expensive
ever raises more doubts about the entire system of
independent counsel. The ACLU hasn't been heard from yet, but
many critics have seen these special prosecutors -- created
by Congress to go after officials in the executive branch --
as civil-liberty time bombs.
   In layman's language, much of the appeals court ruling on
this point can be interpreted as Kaboom] One purpose of the
Fifth Amendment is "to prevent the prosecutor from
transmogrifying into the inquisitor, complete with that
officer's most pernicious tool -- the power of the state to
force a person to incriminate himself." The court noted that
"we do not countenance political trials in this country" and
even doubted whether the most serious charge on which Mr.
North was convicted should have been brought. "No one can
seriously question that people constantly attempt, in
innumerable ways, to obstruct or impede congressional
committees," the court said, but we don't always assume this
amounts to a crime.
   Judge Silberman's separate opinion was especially tough.
He began by referring to the prosecution summary to the jury,
which not only compared Mr. North to Hitler but also referred
three times to the Iran-Contra middlemen making a "killing"
on the deal. Prosecutors wanted to show that money, not Abu
Nidal's threats, motivated the "illegal gratuity" of a
$13,800 security fence for Mr. North's home. The problem was
that Judge Gesell had barred any such description of the
profits without risking rebuttal testimony.
   "I consider the improper comments in the IC's closing
argument to be egregious prosecutorial misconduct," Judge
Silberman wrote, "because they were deliberate rather than
inadvertent." This was an example of how "the IC wished, even
to the extent of violating the agreed upon `rule of
engagement' of the trial, to impugn North's motives." It was
"severe misconduct" to have "coolly crafted" such
"intentionally improper arguments."
   Judge Silberman said this alone would have been nearly
enough to reverse the convictions. He cited a precedent with
lesser sanctions for prosecutorial misconduct, but "of
course, one of the premises of that analysis is that
prosecutors employed by U.S. Attorneys work in something of
an ongoing relationship with federal judges so that a message
sent by one disciplinary action would act as a deterrent to
other prosecutors." Whatever the merits of this argument for
prosecutors who are not independent counsel, "they are
obviously inapplicable here due to the nature of the
prosecutorial unit."
   He also criticized President Reagan for his failure to
invoke executive privilege against Congress or Mr. Walsh. "I
completely fail to see how an ex-President can give answers
to a prosecutor who is independent of any presidential
supervision," Judge Silberman wrote, "and yet assert
executive privilege over the same or similar material when
sought by a defendant." This is especially true because Mr.
North was convicted on "criminal statutes (never before
employed as here) and his defense is that he was lawfully
doing the President's bidding" in an area, foreign policy,
"at the core of the chief executive's constitutional
responsibility."
   This was not the first time Judge Silberman has critiqued
the problems with independent counsel. In a case in January,
1988, involving former Independent Counsel Alexia Morrison,
he dismissed congressionally controlled prosecutors as
unconstitutional. His opinion, reversed by the Supreme Court,
would have saved everyone here a lot of trouble.
   Targets such as Mr. North face prosecutors with unlimited
time and funds to pursue charges no matter how insignificant.
"The independent counsel is cut off from the accumulated lore
and wisdom of career Department of Justice officials," Judge
Silberman wrote in his earlier opinion. "A case that seems
strong and important when viewed in isolation may look weak
or trivial when measured against past cases or in relation to
broader considerations." He concluded, "This is no abstract
dispute concerning the doctrine of separation of powers. The
rights of individuals are at stake."
   Civil libertarian conservativism is a natural in an age of
political prosecutions, independent counsel and RICO. The
good news is that when President Bush made his list of
possible replacements for Justice Brennan, Judge Silberman
finished second runner-up for the job and is a likely
frontrunner for future vacancies.
