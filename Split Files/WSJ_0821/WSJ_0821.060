   Tokyo stocks finished lower in extremely thin trading.
Prices were pushed up and down largely by arbitrage trading
amid few participants on the market.
   In London, the crisis in the Persian Gulf continued to
take its toll, as U.K. shares again closed sharply lower,
albeit above intraday minimums.

   Tokyo trading was quiet, except for some test buying
midday by some individuals and dealers who were trading for
their own accounts. Mainly, investors remained on the
sidelines without new developments in the Middle East.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 296.25 points to
26490.47. Volume on the first section was estimated at 200
million shares, the lowest daily volume since January 1986,
traders said. Friday, 290 million shares changed hands.
Decliners outnumbered gainers 653 to 246, while 187 issues
were unchanged.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was up
319.17 to 26809.64.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 10.32 points Monday, or 0.51%, at
2022.98.
   The second section index dropped 24.01 points, or 0.59%,
to 4048.24. Volume in the section was estimated at seven
million shares, down from 13 million shares Friday.
   The Nikkei Index, which opened the day at 26759 points,
fluctuated in a range of 26456 to 26923. Traders said that
just a small amount of buy or sell orders was able to move
the index because of the thin overall volume.
   Stocks declined from midday gains to close slightly above
intraday lows. Traders said, however, that they saw the
market regain some stability.
   "Money placed on the stock market has become extremely
small," said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading
at Okasan Securities. And any major move in the Middle East
can widely swing prices, he said.
   But a decreased amount of selling and the recovery of
futures indexes back above cash indexes Monday encouraged him
as well as other traders to think that the market has come to
a lull for now.
   Investors held off from buying because of anxiety about
Saturday's warning fire by the U.S. Navy on Iraqi oil tankers
in the Persian Gulf and because of concern about an economic
slowdown in the U.S., as many economists predict a larger
impact of higher oil prices on the U.S. economy than on the
Japanese economy.
   "But sell orders declined sharply Monday, especially from
foreigners," said Shigeru Akiba, head of equity at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   "It says that investors have already sold what they think
they should {in response to the Persian Gulf unrest}. Stock
prices appear to have stopped falling," the official said.
   What lifted the market's mood was the upward swing of
futures indexes to climb above cash indexes, traders said.
   Reflecting growing expectation for future declines and
active short hedging by institutions, futures indexes had
fallen below cash indexes during most of the past trading
days and early Monday morning.
   But as futures indexes recovered a regular spread Monday,
partly supported by stability on the bond market, fear for a
further sharp fall of stock prices was reduced, traders said.
   Among gainers Monday was Pioneer, which ended at 5500 yen,
up 60 yen ($37.30, up 41 cents), following Friday's report by
the company that said consolidated net income this year will
rise 36% to about 40 million yen.
   Non-ferrous metal shares were bought on rising gold prices
and growing demand for aluminum by beverage can makers and
car makers. Nippon Light Metal gained 20 yen to 1210 yen.
Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced 20 yen to 1580 yen.
   In London, dealers said investors were unwilling to take
new positions or hold existing ones, reflecting the
uncertainty and mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   But, while some dealers said the overall decline was
merely a markdown by market makers trying to entice buying
interest, others said investors were growing more jittery
about holding open positions.
   And there was little comfort from other European stock
markets, badly hit on Middle East worries that spilled over
into the London market, commentators said.
   In addition, a handful of major bluechip issues began
trading ex-dividend, pressuring the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index. The index fell 20.3 points to
2156.6, ranging during the day from 2176.5 to 2149.2.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 19.4 points at
1659.5. Turnover amounted to a relatively moderate 350.6
million shares, compared with the 500.5 million shares
Friday.
   International issues were pressured from the outset on a
sharply weaker dollar, continuing the recent weak trend.
Unilever shed 14 pence to 643 pence (27 cents to $12.37)
while Courtaulds dropped 13 pence to 299 pence. Moreover, a
handful of stocks with exposure to the U.S. leisure market
were hurt on perceptions of pending recession across the
Atlantic. Rank Organisation slipped 18 pence to 648 pence,
while Grand Metropolitan retreated 13 pence to 574 pence.
   Guinness continued to lose ground after last week's
earnings results from French luxury group LVMH proved
disappointing. Guinness and LVMH have symmetrical
cross-shareholdings in each other. Guinness fell 12 pence to
678 pence.
   Polly Peck slid 17 pence to 307 pence, up from the
intraday low of 294. The retreat came after the company's
chairman late Friday said he would abandon plans to take the
company private through a buy-out of the 74% of shares he
doesn't already own. The London Stock Exchange said soon
afterward that it will launch an investigation over details
regarding the change in plans.
   Among ex-dividend issues, Barclays shed 14 pence to 349
pence, British Petroleum gained 2.5 pence to 368.5 pence,
Commercial Union Assurance fell 8 pence to 468 pence, GKN
dropped 8.5 pence to 332 pence, Standard Chartered dropped 15
pence to 382 pence, and SmithKline Beecham skidded 6 pence to
528 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan.
South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong,
Seoul, Manila and Wellington, and higher in Taipei.
