   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Fairfield Communities Inc. said First
National Bank of Boston terminated Fairfield's right to draw
additional loans under its $45 million revolving credit
facility, and is requiring Fairfield to repay the loan
outstanding amount of $23.2 million in 47 equal monthly
installments, beginning next month.
   The loss of financing will result in a "significantly"
reduced level of resort-site sales in the third-quarter, as
well as layoffs of an unspecified number of the company's
3,000 workers, said Fairfield, a developer of recreational
and retirement communities. As for earnings, the company said
it was "not yet able to quantify the scope, possible effects
or financial result" of the credit termination.

   Fairfield President John W. McConnell said the bank's
decision came as a surprise. "We've had a 20-year banking
relationship with the Bank of Boston, and we've never
defaulted," he said. Asked to explain the bank's move, Mr.
McConnell said, "That would be speculation. But we do know
that the Bank of Boston has written off hundreds of millions
in loans, and we know that Fairfield Communities' performance
has been less than satisfactory."
   In the second quarter, the Bank of Boston charged off $200
million in bad loans, enabling it to reduce its nonperforming
assets to $1.96 billion from $1.98 billion.
   In the year ended Dec. 31, Fairfield Communities posted a
loss of almost $25 million, or $2.27 a share, on revenue of
about $240 million. Almost $23 million of that loss came from
the sale of discontinued operations. In the first half of
1990, the company had net income of $1.7 million, or 16 cents
a share, including an $840,000 benefit from tax-loss
carry-forwards.
   Observers of the company said they shared Mr. McConnell's
puzzlement. Said Kenneth Campbell, president of Audit
Investments and editor of the Realty Stock Review, "It looks
like someone in Boston said, `Where can we get some money
back?' and went down the list of profitable customers."
   Others say Fairfield's mistake was simply being in the
real estate industry. "There's a generalized credit crunch
affecting real estate borrowers," said Sheldon Grodsky,
director of research for Kenneth, Jerome &amp; Co., adding that
the Bank of Boston in particular "has had its head handed to
itself in real estate lending."
   Mr. McConnell said Bank of Boston was "one of several"
major lenders to Fairfield. He said he had not been notified
of any other credit terminations. He said the $23.2 million
owed Bank of Boston represented less than 10% of Fairfield's
debt. He said the company would seek a lender to replace Bank
of Boston.
