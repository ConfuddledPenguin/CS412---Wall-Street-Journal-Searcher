   The 1980s were a bull market in consumer plastic --
credit, charge, debit and automated-teller cards -- that
changed the way Americans bank and spend. They brought
convenience that is one of the rather invisible gains in
quality of life enjoyed by most of us in a period that is too
casually written off as a gilded era.
   Some equate plastic with phony, contending in this case
that expenditures-made-easy represent a false prosperity for
which we must soon pay dearly. Doubtless, some recklessness
in consumer finance was part of the debt pollution that now
is being cleaned up. But those voices on the political
periphery calling for restrictions on credit cards as part of
a return to solvency have it wrong. The fact that banks, now
the predominant card issuers, are generally pushing these
loans while they tighten up in other sectors is evidence
these purchase plates grease the economy but do not bloat it.

   You get a distinctive view of the card industry at the
Santa Monica, Calif., offices of H. Spencer Nilson, who puts
out a monthly newsletter devoted to the business that has
occupied half of his 69 years, including executive stints at
Diners Club and Carte Blanche.
   Mr. Nilson is upbeat on credit cards, by which he means
any plastic that lets you delay payment -- if only until the
end of the billing cycle. Using figures he boasts of being
singularly able to elicit from card issuers, he says this
debt tripled in nominal terms during the 1980s while the
economy only doubled. Bank cards were the big gainers, up
sixfold. The 1986 tax revision that began a phase-out of
consumer-interest deductions, widely thought to have put a
dent in this trade, registers hardly a blip on his chart. He
shows this growth slackening to a mere doubling during the
'90s, but he attributes that to a lower GNP trajectory not an
aversion to charging.
   If economists don't buy his line, Mr. Nilson scoffs,
that's because they don't have the industry sources that he
does and must rely on incomplete Federal Reserve data. He
admits that not every company confides in him and he must
make an educated guess about some entries. Skeptics among
what Mr. Nilson says are 10,000 readers suspect that he makes
a lot of guesses.
   The card craze that over this century spread from oil
companies to department stores to financial houses has
reached the point where a fanatic such as Mr. Nilson can
accumulate 172 of them. Americans hold a billion, and the
shopper who has any cards at all will have an average of nine
with a total unpaid balance of more than $2,000. Remaining
barriers to use are breaking down, with medical services,
movie tickets and charitable contributions the latest
inroads.
   These paper-work-free loans are hardly high finance, or
even a good way around the crunch that some builders and
other small businesses are complaining about. Although
cardholder Nilson once estimated he could amass a
half-million dollars in cash advances within a month,
job-creating enterprises wouldn't last long paying an annual
rate of about 20%.
   Neither is plastic an end to cash. Indeed, electronic
tellers have made it easier to carry safe amounts, and
greenbacks will always be demanded for small purchases or
those that must be kept secret to avoid taxes, prosecution or
embarrassment. Personal checks, the convenience boon of the
1950s, stand to be the loser, but people still like the float
-- even though technology has shortened it -- that these give
between purchase and payment. That's one reason that Mr.
Nilson isn't big on debit cards, which usually draw down a
bank balance instantly. Giving a merchant the ability to tap
directly into his funds bothers him. He also thinks consumers
will resist shifting from credit to debit cards and losing
the option of contesting a billing before it has been paid.
   As with other competitive industries, buyer preference
along with market structure and technology will shape the
card trade. In addition to paying higher fees for status
cards such as those from American Express, some consumers
have clung to using retailer cards even though bank-card
acceptance has made alternatives unnecessary in most
instances.
   Merchandisers maintain their own label cards (while
increasingly farming out the billing) largely because the
holders make up a great marketing list. James F. Smith, a
veteran of the Sears charge operation (he oversaw the rollout
of the company's Discover card in 1985) who now teaches
finance at the University of North Carolina, recalls that the
chain once offered a Winnie-the-Pooh doll to pregnant
cardholders and got a 25% response.
   Big U.S. banks, hurting in so many ways, are aggressively
seeking new card accounts because they remain profitable. But
Mr. Nilson thinks the big players in Visa and MasterCard this
decade will be the European banks. The JCB card from Japan,
meanwhile, is still a minuscule presence in the U.S.; First
Interstate Bancorp. economist Jerry Jordan says this is
partly because Japanese banks don't care to hold dollar
assets at present.
   The big story in credit, however, is the AT&amp;T card
introduced this year. At no annual fee, Mr. Nilson believes
it is the wave of the future. "AT&amp;T amazed me in how
professional and smart they were in so many ways," he says,
placing it No. 6 in the market already. At this pace it will
be No. 2 behind Citibank (which now has 29 million holders)
within a year. Meanwhile, the card issuers are expanding
their service scope to provide insurance, discounts on phone
bills and legal services.
   The downside for consumers, Mr. Nilson forecasts, is a
steady rise in interest rates on cards, maybe to 25% (largely
because of losses from skyrocketing personal bankruptcies,
which he and other specialists blame on lax new laws and not
overborrowing). And, he says, higher rates charged to
merchants by banks will, with cards now so pervasive, bring
on a general rise in retail prices. Others in the field
challenge that notion.
   Without a general price effect, it's hard to argue that
even the 75 million American adults without credit cards are
losers in the positive-sum world of plastic. (Many of them
are missing the fun by their own doing; Mr. Nilson says
Citibank alone purges 2.5 million a year from its rolls.)
With tax revision having eliminated the deductibility of
consumer finance for those who itemize, the only hidden
subsidies remaining are those folded into the outrageous
write-off for "home-equity" loans.
   State usury laws impeded this revolution until the
interest-rate blowout a decade ago finished most of them off.
Now the appeal of freedom of choice, and the ability of
lenders to work their way around restrictions by locating
processing centers (and jobs) in friendly states, has
rendered the legislative threat virtually moot. And for the
nearly half of card users who pay their bills off before any
penalty applies, the future of low-fee, no-hassles credit --
brought to us by competitive banking and retailing -- looms
bright indeed.

   James Smith, although active in earlier efforts at Sears
to develop a credit card, left the company prior to the
introduction of the Discover card and didn't oversee its
rollout. This information was misstated in Tuesday's Business
World column.
