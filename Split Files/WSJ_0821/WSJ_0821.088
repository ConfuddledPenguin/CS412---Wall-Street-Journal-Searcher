   Questar Corp., an oil and gas concern based in Salt Lake
City, said it increased its expected capital expenditures for
this year to a record $160 million from its initial estimate
of about $140 million. The previous high is $146 million in
1982.
   A spokesman said the spending increase, which will mostly
go for petroleum reserve acquisitions and pipeline
construction, was in the works before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait triggered higher oil prices. But he acknowledged that
turmoil in the Middle East "certainly re-enforced our
strategy of increasing oil and gas reserves."

   Questar said it will finance the spending mainly through
internal sources of funds. It said the expenditures won't
have much effect on earnings in the short term.
