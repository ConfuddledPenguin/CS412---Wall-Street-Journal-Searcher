   SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT, Saudi Arabia -- Marine Cpl. Jerry
M., a thin young man with a worried smile, has set up his
mortar unit in what could only be described as a moonscape of
lifeless rock and hot, wind-parched sand.
   His stubby 81mm mortar is ready, pointed north toward the
Kuwaiti border. The five men in his squad sit in the sparse
shade afforded by a thin camouflage net. The chaos of the
past five days -- the 23-hour flight from California, the
massive confusion at a plane-choked airport, the long drive
to the sea to unload Marine equipment -- is finished. Now
comes the hardest part: the waiting.

   He and thousands of other noncommissioned officers are now
the key players here, in the aftermath of the largest
military buildup over a short span in U.S. history. Now that
the troops are here, they must be kept in fighting trim.
   It is about 110 degrees on the baked, white floor of an
old cement quarry where Cpl. M.'s commander, Lt. Col. James
Mattis, has positioned his company. Col. Mattis talks
excitedly about how interesting it is to be in a place where
the only neighbors are a handful of Bedouins and their
camels: "This is just like Lawrence of Arabia."
   Meanwhile, for the benefit of a visiting television crew,
some of the troops are doing wind sprints, showing how
quickly they can run and set up a machine gun.
   But the harshest aspect of being here is probably what is
most on the minds of the men sitting quietly under Cpl. M.'s
camouflage net. "The sergeant and I are trying to keep their
morale up, joking around and all. As long as they stay in
good humor, we'll be all right," he says. "But the main thing
that's getting everybody out here is the heat."
   (Under the rules of press censorship established by the
Pentagon for this operation, officers can be identified, but
not enlisted men and the names of military bases and troop
positions here.)
   Complaints about sitting around in the heat with no
obvious enemy to confront come first to Cpl. M. "I have to be
a father figure, reminding them when to drink water and
things like that. And I'm only 22 years old," he adds. "It's
a drastic change."
   The complaints eventually filter up to Maj. Gen. John
Hopkins, who notes that his men train regularly in the Mojave
Desert at 29 Palms, Calif. But he admits that he, too, is
awed by the brutal, more humid climate here. "This desert
would make 29 Palms look like Aspen, Colo.," he says.
   Nonetheless, he adds, "I feel confident about it. This is
our stock and trade. This is exactly what the Marine Corps is
all about."
   The introduction to Saudi Arabia comes for most soldiers
on what seems to be a square mile of concrete, floating in
the desert here in the Eastern Province of the kingdom. Like
most Saudi facilities, it was built king-sized. It is one of
the largest air bases in the world.
   There are times, though, when the U.S. Air Force almost
fills it up, simultaneously positioning, unloading and
refueling as many as 15 transports at one time. Tanks, jeeps
and other equipment sprawl over the runway as dazed Marines
and paratroopers stumble into the humid night after their
long journey from home.
   The first troops to arrive last week, a brigade of the
82nd Airborne Division, literally outran their supply line
and had to be supported in the field for two days on Hardee's
beef sandwiches mysteriously produced by the Saudis. There
was a one-day traffic jam on the runway when officials
discovered they didn't have the proper equipment to refuel
the planes.
   It has been an ordeal for the pilots, too. Often flying
24-hour shifts, they shuttle in and out from U.S. bases in
West Germany and Spain. Sgt. Walter K., the Air Force "port
director" who choreographs the movements of the giant,
whining C-141 and C-5B transports on the runway, can let them
stay only for two hours -- just long enough to unload and
refuel.
   "I don't think anything in history has happened with a
surge this big," says the sergeant. The top brass here agree,
saying that even counting World War II, the U.S. has never
airlifted so much so quickly.
   So far, after hundreds of arrivals, only one transport has
broken down on the runway. Maj. T.J. Hedding III, 37, an Air
Force reservist from San Bernardino, Calf., wonders how long
the human side will hold up.
   He flew his C-141 in yesterday and stood watching as a
group of young Marines prepared their equipment. When he
flies back to the U.S. air base at Torrejon, Spain, he will
sleep in a cramped 10-by-10-foot room with three other pilots
on cots. Ten hours later, he will be aloft on another run to
Saudi Arabia. He has been doing that for seven days in a row.
   "These kids are all gung-ho," says Maj. Hedding, referring
to the Marines. "I don't think the fact that they are on the
brink of a real shooting war has sunk in yet."
   If there is a war here, it will be the first one in which
the troops are driven to the front in red, white and blue
double-decker buses. The Saudis have borrowed them from
transit systems in Riyadh and elsewhere and they line up at
the air base day and night, waiting to shuttle the troops out
to the desert.
   After waiting at the air bases for a day-and-a-half,
Marine Sgt. David J., 29, of Lawrence, Ill., and his men
boarded one of the buses and it promptly got lost, the driver
weaving back and forth on the empty Los Angeles-sized
freeways here for five hours before he found the seaport
where the Marines were to draw their heavy equipment.
   "For a while, all we talked about was chemical weapons,"
recalls the sergeant, who says his men have gradually become
acclimated to the heat and resigned to the possibility of
having to face an Iraqi poison-gas attack.
   The seaport is the key to the sudden presence of Gen.
Hopkins's 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. There, Col. Bob
Redlin, the brigade's logistics officer, says 2,000
containers and 3,000 tanks, howitzers, trucks, armored cars
and other items were unloaded in 36 hours from three ships
that sailed in from the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean.
   "Ten days ago, I was in Norfolk, Va., at my
father-in-law's funeral and this stuff was sitting in storage
in Diego Garcia. A week later, I was in this port unloading
the equipment," he says, referring to the growing mountain of
gear and supplies -- enough to sustain 16,500 men for 30 days
of combat -- that is arriving on the docks here.
   The next problem he and other officers face is how to
provide relief for their tired troops if the Persian Gulf
crisis evolves into a long waiting game. Arranging rest and
recreation will be difficult here, in a country that forbids
alcoholic beverages and is extremely concerned about
protecting women from even the gaze of outsiders.
   "As long as it remains Saudi R&amp;R, we have no trouble with
that," notes one Saudi official.
