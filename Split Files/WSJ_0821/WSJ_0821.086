   Although an overwhelming 72% of Americans back President
Bush's actions in the deserts of the Middle East, they're
less sure about his conduct in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Only 53% approved of his taking time to vacation at his
seacoast home just now, with 39% disapproving, in a poll
taken over the weekend before the hostage drama escalated.
Television news has juxtaposed Mr. Bush playing golf with
poignant interviews with relatives of Americans presumably
being held hostage.

   "I was saddened to see . . . Mr. Bush playing golf and
going fishing after having sent U.S. troops overseas," said
Lawrence Naumoff, 44, a Chapel Hill, N.C., novelist. "It was
a vision of the old-fashioned ugly American who doesn't
reflect on what his actions have caused."
   However, Edith Seibert, a housewife from Hermitage, Pa.,
said, "His mind is much clearer up there {in Maine} without
everybody in Washington beating on him to make a military
strike."
   Mr. Bush broke off his vacation for the second time
yesterday to meet with advisers in Washington, then returned
to Maine. The White House says that this is a working
vacation and that, thanks to sophisticated communications,
Mr. Bush can manage the nation's affairs as well in Maine as
in Washington.
