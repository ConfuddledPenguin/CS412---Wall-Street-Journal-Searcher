   I read with interest your July 19 page-one article on TV
fan clubs. Fan clubs centering on a particular series are not
a recent phenomenon, nor are those which are bizarre or
narrowly focused.
   As an undergraduate at Princeton in the early '70s, I was
a charter member of just such a fan club. The Royal Huntation
Society of Princeton University (its full name) comprised a
small group of hard-core devotees. The members were devoted
enough, in fact, to secure official recognition from the
university as an extracurricular activity.

   What did we do? We watched old episodes of "Sea Hunt" on
late night TV and counted the number of times Lloyd Bridges
would say "Huh." (Such as, "So you think those air tanks were
deliberately poisoned, huh?") We counted at least 500 huh's
in one semester.
   Great, Huh?
