   BONN -- Reiner Gohlke quit as director of the trust agency
responsible for privatizing East Germany's economy, raising
new speculation that the country is on the brink of economic
chaos.
   Mr. Gohlke, former head of West Germany's railways, said
he was leaving his post because of differences with fellow
board members over how best to fulfill the job. But West
German sources said Mr. Gohlke was increasingly impatient
with the unwillingness of Western industry to invest in the
East. Mr. Gohlke also has complained about resistance within
the East German trust agency, known as the Treuhandanstalt,
from holdover employees from the former communist government.

   Meanwhile, the rapid collapse of East Berlin's government
continued with the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from
the post-communist ruling coalition. Analysts said that by
bolting, the Social Democrats would accelerate the move
toward formal German unity, currently expected by Dec. 2.
   The political crisis in East Berlin is likely to
fundamentally alter relations between the two German
governments. Until now, there seemed a good chance that the
two sides could get an agreement that maintained the illusion
of unifying two equal partners.
   But now that their government has crumbled, the East
Germans are likely to simply declare themselves out of
existence by joining the West. In that case, West German laws
would extend to East Germany and the country would be
governed by a set of interim regulations until formal unity
after the Dec. 2 all-German elections. And even that date
could be advanced: The Social Democrats are vowing to seek a
vote in the East German parliament this week to accelerate
German unity to mid-September.
   The resignation of Mr. Gohlke comes as doubts are growing
over the East German government's ability to carry through an
aggressive economic reform program. Having committed itself
to the ultimate goal of German unification, East Berlin is
hard-pressed to make difficult or unpopular decisions.
   "There's hardly any state authority left in East Berlin to
carry through on any decisions," said one West German
official. The resignation of Mr. Gohlke "is just another sign
of that weakness."
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said Mr.
Gohlke would be succeeded by Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, head
of Hoesch AG, the big West German steel concern. Mr.
Rohwedder, a former official in Bonn's Finance Ministry,
already is head of the trust agency's supervisory board.
   Mr. Rohwedder met yesterday with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, presumably to discuss strategies for dealing
with East German economic problems.
   The trust agency is trying to determine which of East
Germany's 8,000 companies can be salvaged and is arranging
for temporary financing to allow most of the companies to
continue functioning.
   The two Germanys merged their economies on July 1, but
most East German companies appear unable to compete in the
new competitive environment without special assistance.
