   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Donald J. Trump reached a
compromise with about 60 subcontractors who are owed about
$70 million for their work on the Taj Mahal casino here.
   A pact was signed by Mr. Trump and the subcontractors just
in time for the New Jersey Casino Control Commission to rule
on Mr. Trump's $65 million bank bailout today without the
threat of an immediate default judgment against Mr. Trump
hanging over the proceedings. The contractors, many of whom
said they had employed extra personnel to help Mr. Trump open
the Taj by April 2, 1990, had threatened to force Mr. Trump
to seek bankruptcy-law protection if they weren't paid. Mr.
Trump hasn't paid them because the casino hasn't generated as
much cash as expected.

   Terms of the deal are believed to include a deferral of
almost all the claims against Mr. Trump for at least a week.
After that, the contractors are scheduled to get about 20
cents on the dollar, or about $14 million, with future
payments deferred, said one person familiar with the terms of
the agreement. It isn't clear where Mr. Trump will get the
cash to make the payments or whether he can use any of the
expected $65 million bank loan for that purpose.
