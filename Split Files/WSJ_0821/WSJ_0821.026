   LOS ANGELES -- Mark E. Buchman was named president and
chief executive officer of BKLA Bancorp and of its Bank of
Los Angeles subsidiary, succeeding Gerald S. Weisstein, who
has held those posts since 1985.
   Mr. Weisstein, 51 years old, said he was leaving because
"my contract is at an end," and "it's my desire to get into a
larger bank where the challenges might be a bit more
expansive." During his tenure, the bank's assets grew to
about $173 million from about $120 million, he said.
