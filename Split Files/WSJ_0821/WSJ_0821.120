   NEW YORK -- National construction contracting activity
seems to be stabilizing after a steep decline early this
year.
   In the latest revision of its 1990 outlook, F.W. Dodge,
McGraw-Hill Inc.'s forecasting unit, projected a 7% decline
in construction contracting this year to $247.08 billion from
1989's record $266.97 billion.

   "The worst seems to be over for the building market
nationally," said George A. Christie, vice president and
chief economist at Dodge. Still, Mr. Christie warned that
while reduced construction because of the savings and loan
crisis had already occurred, replacing S&amp;Ls as a source of
construction loans will be a "time-consuming process."
   The survey said it expects non-residential building
contracts to decline 10% this year, to $85.6 billion,
including a 17% decline in commercial and manufacturing
buildings, a 7% gain in educational building contracts, and a
1% decline in hospital and health construction. Office
building contracts are expected to decline 23%.
   Funding for nonbuilding construction is expected to ease
2%, to $47.7 billion, with transportation contracts flat and
environmental public works down 1%. Utility construction is
expected to fall 15%.
   Residential construction, forecast at $113.8 billion, is
expected to fall 7%, with a 3% decline in single-family
houses and a 20% decline in multifamily housing.
