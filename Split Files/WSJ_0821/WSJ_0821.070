   Before we can buy our dream house
   We must sell the home we now own,
   And the party who hopes to buy it
   Is facing the same syndrome.
   The person he wants to sell to
   Must have a contingency deed
   Based on whether he can get
   The financing he will need.
   So all concerned are on needles and pins
   And our nerves are nearly wrecked
   As we learn the hard way what is meant
   By the "domino effect."
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   Beginning to End
                                                                                                       

   It starts with waiting
   To be old enough
   To cross the street alone;
   To select what you choose
   To wear --
   To walk to school
   On your own.
   Then it happens --
   You're an adult
   Able to set pace
   And tone --
   Then the last thing
   You want is to be
   Left alone]
   -- Beatrice Kess.
