   NEW YORK -- Investors, relieved that once again the Middle
East didn't explode over the weekend, timidly bid prices of
big stocks slightly higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.64 points to
2656.44 on volume of 129.6 million shares. Long-term U.S.
Treasury bond prices ended little changed, although they were
up in very light trading most of the day partly because of a
dip in oil prices. The dollar was mostly higher.

   The gain in the Dow Jones industrials doesn't signal a
market turnaround, traders said. Broader market measures
didn't perform as well. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and
the New York Stock Exchange composite index both rose
proportionately much less than the Dow, and over-the-counter
stocks fell. Even on the Big Board the number of declining
issues was well ahead of advancers.
   Barry Saghal, research director at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp;
Co., noted that the Dow derived much of its strength from
oil-related issues. Assuming the Mideast situation doesn't
develop suddenly into either all-out war or peace, he expects
stock prices to sag in midweek and then take another nose
dive before the weekend.
   "The markets just don't know how to discount acts of war,"
said Mr. Saghal.
   Paul Kronlokken, technical analyst at Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised to see
blue-chip stocks rise a little. The market's 11.4% decline
since the Dow Jones industrials nearly breached 3000 last
month has been more persistent than the 9.5% selloff in
January that took the Dow to 2543.24, the low for the year,
he noted.
   Bond traders said what little action there was for much of
the day consisted of investors selling short-term notes and
buying long-term bonds in anticipation of an auction of
two-year and five-year notes next week. Traders are betting
such an auction will depress prices on short-term debt. But
trading was extremely thin and prices fell back in late
afternoon.
   The dollar rose against most major currencies but fell
against the yen because of cross-trading among non-U.S.
currencies. Traders were buying yen, having concluded that
Japan is less vulnerable to the lack of oil supplies from
Iraq and Kuwait than previously thought, said Jeffrey
Mondschein, foreign-exchange director at Continental Bank in
Chicago.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in thin trading. Declining Big Board
issues outnumbered advancers, 920 to 629.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.93%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5650 marks and 146.44 yen, compared
with 1.5495 marks and 147.58 yen Friday.
