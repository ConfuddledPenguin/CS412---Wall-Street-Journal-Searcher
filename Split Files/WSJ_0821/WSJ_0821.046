   My, aren't the Ukrainians brave, now that the modern world
has forgotten their role in World War II (page one, July 17).
Armed with bouquets of flowers, they greeted the invading
Nazis. They remind me of the obnoxious, badly behaved child
who petulantly craves constant attention. I refer you to the
book "Mila 18," wherein they were called the "nightingales"
because they sang and betrayed anyone to the powers that be
in concentration camps.
