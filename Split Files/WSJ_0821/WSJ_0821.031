   The controversial Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant,
long at the center of the battle between opponents and
supporters of nuclear power, is up and running at full power.
   The $6.6 billion plant was completed four years ago, 14
years after construction began, but it sat idle while various
groups challenged the adequacy of evacuation plans in the
event of an accident at the plant. It received a full-power
license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission earlier this
year.

   The plant, owned by 11 New England utilities, had been
tested at the 100% power level in recent weeks. It started
full-power operations on Sunday and will produce 1,150
megawatts of electricity -- enough to supply one million
homes, Seabrook officials said.
   The prolonged battle over Seabrook caused substantial
write-offs for several of its owners and eventually led to
the bankruptcy-protection filing by its lead owner, Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire. The utility couldn't service
the debt it took on to finance its Seabrook stake.
   Several legal challenges over the adequacy of evacuation
plans remain, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
conducting an inquiry into its own procedures in licensing
the plant. But analysts believe it is highly unlikely that
the plant's license will be revoked.
