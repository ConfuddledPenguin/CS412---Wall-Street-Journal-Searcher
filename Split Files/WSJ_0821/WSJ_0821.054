   Dallas and Fort Worth enjoy a reputation as the nation's
best location for industry. There's nothing wrong with that
to the extent that it means first-class public services at
reasonable cost, or cutting red tape. But in one glaring
instance Dallas's "pro-business" leadership has succumbed to
the "what's good for General Motors is good for Detroit"
fiction. The city is even engaging in a costly exercise in
corporate socialism.
   This example of private interest superseding the public
good has its roots in 1974, when Dallas-Fort Worth opened as
a regional airport. It was built to take over regional
traffic from Dallas's older municipal airport, Love Field. In
1979, then Fort Worth Congressman and House Majority Leader
Jim Wright secured legislation, now known as the Wright
Amendment, to restrict commercial air traffic at Love Field.
The amendment limited Love Field traffic to origins and
destinations within Texas or four contiguous states. The
rationale was twofold: to nurture the new Dallas-Fort Worth
Airport until it could stand on its own and to allay Fort
Worth's fears that Dallas was not seriously committed to the
newer airport.

   Stated rationale aside, the appropriate question to ask
with respect to such protection is, cui bono? Obviously, DFW
Airport has been a major beneficiary of the "infant industry"
protections accorded by the Wright Amendment: In the 11 years
since the amendment's passage, DFW has become the nation's
second-busiest airport and is projected to surpass Chicago's
O'Hare as the world's busiest within five years. The
amendment's restrictions have also promoted Fort Worth-based
American Airlines' dominance of DFW while allowing
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines to carve out a profitable
niche at Love. In fact, Southwest is Love's sole carrier.
   Anyone who has passed through DFW of late knows this
heavily congested airport no longer needs the "protection" of
the Wright Amendment. But passengers originating in or
connecting through DFW desperately need protection from the
inflated airfares that result from a federally sanctioned
duopoly (of American and Delta) at DFW and monopoly at Love
Field. For example, a recent Department of Transportation
study, which concluded generally that airline deregulation
has been a boon to travelers, also observed that typical
fares at DFW are 15% to 20% higher than the national norm. A
1989 Federal Trade Commission investigation found that
passengers at both airports would reap lower airfares and
experience fewer flight delays if the restrictions at Love
were repealed.
   In turn, last year Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) sponsored bills to repeal the
Wright Amendment. Neither bill went anywhere; Mr. Glickman's
was stymied in the House Aviation Subcommittee, whose
membership includes Rep. Pete Geren (D., Texas) from Jim
Wright's former district, while the Senate opted to steer
clear of what it perceived to be a local matter.
   Nonetheless, encouraged by these efforts and recognizing
Love Field as an underutilized asset that could contribute to
the city's economic development, the Dallas City Council --
Love's governing body -- last fall passed a resolution
supporting replacement of the Wright Amendment. It advocated
extending the airport's perimeter limit to 650 miles -- a
reach as far north as Omaha and as far east as Nashville. Not
surprisingly, officials in neighboring Fort Worth went
ballistic, accusing Dallas of reneging on a sacrosanct
agreement thought of as the basis for regional cooperation.
   Sensing a groundswell in Dallas for modification of the
Wright Amendment -- and a challenge to its position --
American Airlines' Chairman Robert Crandall then weighed in.
First he demanded access to 11 gates at Love Field and
promised 200 flights daily out of the airport. Then he
threatened to cancel plans to build a new terminal at DFW.
The former was effective in heightening neighboring
residents' noise and safety fears, while the latter indelibly
identified American's interests with those of DFW Airport
and, more important, the entire North Texas region. Last, but
not least, American convinced virtually every public and
civic group in North Texas to lobby against the City
Council's effort to open access to Love Field.
   Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, this spring broke its
long-standing silence to propose to the City Council a
self-serving "compromise" that would not only preserve the
Wright Amendment restrictions -- and the airline's Love Field
monopoly -- but also permit direct and connecting flights
beyond Texas's four contiguous states. Not surprisingly, a
majority of the City Council caved in under American's
full-court press and rescinded its resolution endorsing the
650-mile perimeter.
   How does the City Council justify its decision? Mainly
with the weak excuse that it's the "pro-business" thing to
do: American is a major employer and contributes mightily to
the regional economy. Half-apologetically, Mayor Annette
Strauss has been heard to quip with reference to American:
"Where does a 2,000-pound gorilla sit? Anywhere he wants to."
The unspoken and less humorous reality of the situation,
however, is that Dallas has meekly agreed to perpetuate an
outdated legislative relic that restricts competition, limits
choices, hinders local economic development and imposes undue
costs on the flying public across the nation.
   The Love Field matter could be quickly resolved by
Congress, but Washington's self-styled paladins of free
enterprise, including several from the Texas delegation,
apparently don't have the stomach for a fight that would
displease the nation's largest and most powerful airline.
Ultimately, air travelers must seek redress in court -- the
only place, it seems, where public policy is made these days.
