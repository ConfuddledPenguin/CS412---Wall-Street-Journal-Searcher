   Recession-Proof Stocks Haven't Always Protected

   Many investors nowadays figure that as long as the economy
muddles through without a recession, stocks will do all
right.
   Even worrywarts can rest easy, as long as they load up on
stocks in such "recession-proof" industries as drugs, food,
tobacco and utilities, or so the conventional wisdom says.

   History, however, has another story to tell: Not only do
bear markets often arrive without a recession -- and
recessions without bear markets -- but defensive stocks don't
always offer much protection when stocks do fall.
   A bear market is often defined as a market in which stock
prices fall 15% or more. Since 1960, investors have been
mauled by six of them. But only half of those bear markets
were recession-related, according to Ibbotson Associates
Inc., a Chicago investment-research firm.
   The most notable exception was the downdraft that
culminated in the 1987 stock-market crash, one of the worst
drops since the crash of 1929. From its peak in mid-August
1987 to its trough in October, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index plunged about 36%. (Even looking at full-month total
returns, including dividends, the drop exceeded 23%.) But
there wasn't any sign of negative economic growth, let alone
a recession. Ordinarily, the National Bureau of Economic
Research, the official scorekeeper on such matters, requires
at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth before
it calls a recession.
   This isn't to say that bear markets aren't important
economic signals. "In most of these cases {where no recession
materialized}, the market did accurately predict a growth
slowdown," said Anirvan Banerji, an economist at Columbia
University's Center for International Business Cycle
Research.
   The Columbia researchers, unlike the Commerce Department,
don't include the stock market in their index of leading
economic indicators because it is "too sensitive to the
economy," he said. In the cases where the market did
correctly foresee a recession, it was on average eight to 10
months early, according to Mr. Banerji.
   Stock prices also tend to anticipate economic recoveries
by four to six months. A look at the track record shows that
when a recession is mild, stock prices are often on the
rebound about the time the recession is getting under way.
But when a recession is long and severe, the market often
takes its most harrowing pratfall after the recession
arrives.
   The market's subtle knack for spotting economic shifts
stems from the fact that stock prices reflect future
expectations, not just current realities. In particular, the
market's performance is frequently linked closely to how
investors view the changing long-term outlook for corporate
profits and interest rates.
   That means, for instance, that when the economy is running
at full steam, straining capacity and reviving inflation,
investors are already looking ahead to higher interest rates
and softer company earnings. As investors rush to take their
bull-market gains, the market can sell off sharply even when
the anticipated downturn fails to register as a recession.
   Investor expectations also help explain why five out of 11
recessions that occurred since 1929 weren't accompanied by
bear markets. "Most of those {solo} recessions were extremely
mild" and occurred in periods, such as the '40s, '50s and
early '80s, when the economy was recovering from a very low
base, said Laurence Siegel, managing director at Ibbotson
Associates. The market was factoring in "not just the next
few months of recession but a long period of tremendous
anticipated growth in the future."
   Today, in contrast, the economy is sputtering at the end
of one of the longest economic booms in history, and a
growing number of investment professionals see high odds of a
bear market ahead, whether an "official" recession
materializes or not. They think the market isn't sufficiently
discounting some clear and present troubles on the corporate
profit front that justify an additional 10% drop in share
prices, even after the latest oil-induced slide.
   "The market is still complacent," said Carmine Grigoli,
chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp.
"There are certain characteristics that are not yet reflected
in stocks prices but should be."
   Among the biggest threats to corporate profits, and by
inference to stock prices, is debt, the pros say.
   Even before the Iraqi invasion sent oil prices soaring,
companies were "having trouble passing through costs," said
Mr. Grigoli. "Meanwhile, interest expense is already
absorbing a near record proportion of corporate cash flow."
This pincer movement "will make the earnings decline much
more pronounced than in past recessions" if the economy
weakens further, he said.
   Because of the unusual profit risks today, Mr. Grigoli
believes stock prices, on average, shouldn't be more than
13.5 times companies' per-share earnings. That's well below
the current "market multiple" of about 15 times earnings, but
not as bad as it could get, he said. "Multiples have hit an
average low of 10 times earnings in post-war recessions," he
said.
   Why isn't the market discounting these risks? One reason
is that expectations may still be too rosy after the go-go
experience of the 1980s, said John Hagler, of investment
advisers Hagler, Mastrovita &amp; Hewitt. "We've cranked into
stock prices great expectations with respect to future
corporate profitability and growth" that are based on the
leverage-driven performance of the last decade, he said.
   That performance is "probably unrepeatable," given the
current high level of corporate, government and consumer
debt, Mr. Hagler said. But before investors' expectations
drop to realistic levels, the market may go through "either a
short and painful correction or, as my suspicion is, a long
Chinese water torture lasting three or four years."
   Hilda Ochoa, president of Strategic Investment Management,
sees other reasons why stocks could be in for trouble now.
"The market is definitely more overvalued now than it was in
the {weak economy of the} late '70s and early '80s" by as
much as 20% to 30%, she said. And history shows that the more
overvalued stocks are, the "more vulnerable {they are to} the
slightest negative shock or change in evaluation of the
economy."
   And that's not all. "Shrinking liquidity arising from debt
problems and lower structural demand for stocks" also bode
ill for stocks, she said. For instance, corporate buyers have
less appetite for stocks now that the takeover boom is over;
most pension funds are fully funded and won't be adding much
to their portfolios; and foreign buyers aren't as likely to
venture into U.S. stocks at a time when they too are being
hurt by higher oil prices and rising interest rates, she
said.
   Under the circumstances, stock-market investors who think
they can play it safe may have some rude surprises coming.
Many classic "defensive" plays have backfired in recessions
and bear markets over the past 20 years, an analysis by
BARRA, a Berkeley, Calif., investment-research firm shows. As
the table accompanying this article shows, most stock groups
widely considered to be defensive caused investors big losses
when the market fell. Moreover, they often lost more than the
market as a whole.
   Despite what brokers may say about these blue-chip
bastions, the performance of these stocks has a lot less to
do with their "recession-proof" earnings than the multiple of
earnings that investors pay to buy them in the first place,
the pros say.
   "What's recession-proof about them?" asked Ibbotson's Mr.
Siegel. "By the time everybody wants them, they're probably
priced too far out of reach to offer good returns."
