   WASHINGTON -- The crisis in the Middle East has already
started to boost official estimates of the U.S. budget
deficit.
   The White House budget office and the Congressional Budget
Office said they increased their estimates of the budget
deficit for fiscal 1991 by about $1 billion as a result of
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. That increase reflects
government-guaranteed farm loans and export loans to Iraq now
unlikely to be repaid.

   And that's just a small beginning. The figures don't show
it, but government officials say that the increase in defense
spending and the slowdown in the economy that result from the
Mideast crisis will add tens of billions of dollars to the
budget deficit next year. The result, barring new
deficit-cutting measures, will almost certainly be the
largest budget deficit in U.S. history, between $250 billion
and $300 billion.
   President Bush met with his staff on the budget in
Washington to complete work on a Republican proposal for
cutting the deficit. White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said: "We will have a significant package to put on the
table" when negotiations with Congress resume after Labor
Day.
   The new White House budget estimates, which exclude any
effects on the economy from the Middle East crisis but
include costs of the savings and loan bailout, put next
year's deficit at $232.3 billion.
   Yesterday's White House report, required by the
Gramm-Rudman budget law, shows that following that law's
strict formula, which excludes much of the S&amp;L spending, the
deficit for next year is estimated at $149.4 billion. That
means the government must cut the deficit by $85.4 billion to
meet the Gramm-Rudman law's target of $64 billion for fiscal
1991.
   If Congress and the White House fail to agree on a budget
plan in September, the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic spending
cuts will take hold Oct. 1, when the fiscal year begins. The
White House report said those cuts would slash many domestic
spending programs at least 32.4% and cut defense programs --
excluding military payrolls -- by a sharp 35.3%.
   The spending cuts are so Draconian, and their effects on
the government so severe, that most government officials say
Congress and the White House are virtually certain to prevent
them from taking place. Although the cuts are automatic,
Congress and the president can cancel them with a simple
piece of legislation.
   The White House budget office estimates are based on an
economic forecast that was prepared before Iraq invaded
Kuwait. Since that time, a sharp rise in oil prices has led
administration officials to acknowledge that economic growth
is likely to slow substantially. Internal administration
estimates suggest a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of
oil will cut growth by roughly 1.2 percentage points. That,
in turn, could add a further $25 billion to $30 billion to
the budget deficit. Higher interest rates could make that
deficit boost even larger.
   In addition, the massive deployment of U.S. troops to the
Middle East is likely to put upward pressure on defense
spending. President Bush said yesterday "we cannot attack the
deficit by attacking the very heart of our armed forces,
committed men and women who are motivated and ready."
   Mr. Bush said he will "oppose the defense budget slashers
who are out of tune with what America needs to keep freedom
secure and safe." And he criticized the House Armed Services
Committee for suggesting "unacceptable cuts from our defense
budget for fiscal year 1991."
   Later in the day the president told reporters that all
Pentagon cuts aren't off the table, just "reckless Pentagon
cuts are -- we just can't tolerate them. And I think that
most members of Congress will return and understand this
now."
   President Bush continues to push for a broad
deficit-cutting accord, and he plans to meet with
congressional leaders at Andrews Air Force Base in the first
week of September. The White House goal is to cut roughly $50
billion from the deficit in fiscal 1991, and $500 billion
over five years.
   But in the wake of the Mideast crisis, some members of
Congress say the chances for a budget deal have faded. With
the odds of recession rising, politicians worry that
deficit-cuts could push the economy over the brink. One
possible compromise discussed by some administration
officials would be to cut significantly less than $50 billion
in the first year, but still try to make close to $500
billion in cuts over five years.
   The Congressional Budget Office report calculated next
fiscal year's deficit by Gramm-Rudman rules at an even-larger
$165.2 billion, requiring cuts of $101.2 billion to reach the
Gramm-Rudman target. But while the congressional report is
required by the Gramm-Rudman law, it has no effect in
calculating the automatic spending cuts.
   Like the White House, the Congressional Budget Office said
that including savings and loan spending, next year's deficit
is estimated to exceed $230 billion. The largest budget
deficit in the past was in 1986, when it reached $221.2
billion.
