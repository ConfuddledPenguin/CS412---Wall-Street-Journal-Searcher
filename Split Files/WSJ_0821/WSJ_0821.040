   The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 805 registered voters
conducted Saturday and Sunday by the polling organizations of
Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 263 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental United States. Each region of the
country was represented in proportion to its population.
Households were selected by a method that gave all telephone
numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being
included. One registered voter, 18 years or older, was
selected from each household by a procedure to provide the
correct number of male and female respondents. The results of
the survey were minimally weighted by race and party
identification to assure that the poll accurately reflects
registered voters nationwide.

   Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
3.5 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.
