   K mart Corp., citing increased sales and "careful
monitoring" of expenses, said its second-quarter earnings
rose 2.1% to $148 million, or 74 cents a share, from $145
million, or 72 cents a share.
   Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 1 rose 11% to $7.78
billion from $7.01 billion a year earlier.

   The discount retailer said that despite a relatively weak
retail environment, its earnings improved as increased sales
and expense monitoring offset higher interest expense and the
reduction in gross margins from the lowering of prices. K
mart, which is based in Troy, Mich., said it was particularly
encouraged by the strength in apparel sales as well as strong
sales of seasonal merchandise.
   In the first six months, K mart earned $248.1 million, or
$1.24 a share, compared with $239.1 million, or $1.19 a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $14.83 billion from
$13.07 billion.
