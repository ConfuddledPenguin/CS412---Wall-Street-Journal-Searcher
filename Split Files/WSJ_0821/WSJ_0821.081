   Holnam Inc.'s holding company Holderman Inc. agreed to
increase its stake in the cement manufacturer to 89.3% from
87.2% by acquiring 22.2 million newly issued common shares
for $99.9 million.
   Separately, Dundee, Mich.-based Holnam said it expects a
loss of 10 cents to 15 cents a share in 1990 because of cost
increases and declining sales. The company earlier predicted
it would finish the year with net income of five to 10 cents
a share.
