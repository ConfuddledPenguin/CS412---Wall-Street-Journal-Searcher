   CHINA'S BUDGET DEFICIT

   China unveiled figures showing its budget deficit for this
year is widening.
   Government spending climbed 16.4% in the first seven
months this year, outpacing an 11.6% rise in revenue, said
the China Daily, quoting the State Statistical Bureau. The
official newspaper didn't give specific budget figures for
the period.
   The official projection for the 1990 budget has set the
deficit for this year at the equivalent of $1.8 billion,
narrowed from $1.9 billion in 1989. But economists said the
reduction was unlikely to be achieved. "The lower deficit
called for in the budget is now looking increasingly
optimistic," one foreign economist said.
   The newspaper didn't say why spending was rising, but it
noted that profits of state companies slid 20% in the first
seven months of the year. Last year, subsidies to keep prices
artificially low and to bail out inefficient state companies
accounted for one-third of government spending.
                                                                                                       

   EC ANTI-DUMPING ACTIONS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community opened an investigation into
imports of disposable Japanese lighters. The EC also said it
will reconsider a decision, announced in January, to end
anti-dumping duties that were imposed in 1985 on hydraulic
excavators from Japan.
                                                                                                       

   ISRAEL DELAYS TRANSMITTER
                                                                                                       

   Israeli environmentalists won a temporary injunction
barring the Voice of America from building a
radio-transmitter complex in the Negev desert until
environmental questions are answered. Last month, a
government planning board approved the billion-dollar project
aimed at broadcasting programs of the Voice of America and
Radio Liberty.
                                                                                                       

   VIETNAM-SOUTH KOREA TALKS
                                                                                                       

   Vietnam will send a delegation to South Korea next month
to discuss economic cooperation, the first official visit
since before the Vietnam War, officials in Seoul said. South
Korean business groups have expressed interest in mining and
in building small factories in Vietnam to take advantage of
cheap labor costs.
                                                                                                       

   MARCOS'S SWISS ACCOUNTS
                                                                                                       

   A brother-in-law of Philippine President Corazon Aquino
launched a movement to pressure Swiss authorities to return
millions of dollars allegedly stolen by the late President
Ferdinand Marcos and deposited in Switzerland. Sen. Agapito
Aquino said he formed the "Swiss Watch" organization because
the government had failed to recover the money through court
actions. The Aquino government has accused Mr. Marcos of
stealing up to $10 billion from the national treasury during
his 20-year rule.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino said she will attend
Emperor Akihito's enthronement rites in Japan in November, as
scheduled, despite domestic problems and new coup threats
against her government. . . . The Matterhorn claimed the life
of a mountain guide for the first time in 39 years when a
Swiss guide and a U.S. climber fell to their deaths.
