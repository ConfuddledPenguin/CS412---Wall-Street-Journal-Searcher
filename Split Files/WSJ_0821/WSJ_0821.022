   NEW YORK -- After competing with each other for years, the
two largest networks of automated teller machines said
yesterday they had agreed to give access to their machines to
each others' customers. The move could double the number of
ATMs available to consumers nationwide within a year.
   The announcement by Cirrus System, a unit of MasterCard
International Inc., and Plus System, which is owned by a
group of banks and Visa International Inc., however, does not
automatically give access to the other system; each bank must
agree to open its machines to customers of the other system.

   ATM cardholders presently have only Cirrus or Plus
imprinted on their cards; these cardholders will have access
to additional ATM machines only if those machines display the
other system's logo. As a Cirrus spokeswoman said, "People
will still have to match up the Cirrus logo on their card
with a Cirrus logo on the door of a bank to make sure they
can conduct business there."
   Cirrus and Plus apparently made the move to allow access
because of pressure from member banks that want to attract to
their ATMs as many transactions and accompanying fees as
possible.
   Although some banks may not believe the added convenience
for customers is worth the extra cost banks will incur, some
of the largest banks, including BankAmerica Corp.'s Bank of
America and Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Manhattan Bank,
have already signed up for the new network sharing
arrangement.
   The announcement by Cirrus and Plus was hailed by industry
observers who have long criticized the confusing array of
regional and national arrangements for sharing ATMs.
   David Taylor, a group executive with the Bank
Administration Institute, said, "This is a very positive step
for everybody. It gives consumers much greater accessibility
and approaches the convenience in ATMs that we should have
had long ago."
   In addition, wider sharing of ATMs will relieve banks from
some of the costs of expanding their own ATM networks. Most
banks, with the notable exception of Citicorp's Citibank
branch system in New York City, belong to one network or the
other.
   The Cirrus network has about 33,000 ATMs nationwide
available to 275 million cardholders, including all holders
of MasterCard credit cards. Plus has about 27,000 machines
that are accessible to 130 million cardholders.
