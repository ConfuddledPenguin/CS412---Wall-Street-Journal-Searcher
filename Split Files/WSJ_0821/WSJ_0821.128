   SAN DIEGO -- A small group of union employees involved in
labor contract negotiations with one of the subsidiaries of
Triton Group Ltd. are urging Triton shareholders to reject a
proposed merger with Intermark Inc.
   The merger is unfair to Triton shareholders and would hurt
union members by weakening Triton and its subsidiaries, said
Richard Zell, secretary-treasurer of United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers Local 1119 in the San Francisco area.

   Under the merger agreement, Triton holders would receive
1.4 shares of Intermark common stock for each share of Triton
common. Intermark, a San Diego-based holding company that
already owns a 51.6% stake in Triton, would be the surviving
entity.
   Roughly 300 United Food union members are employed by
Liquor Barn, a retail chain with 65 stores in California.
Only 11 are members of Local 1119, Mr. Zell said. Triton,
also based in San Diego, acquired a two-thirds interest in
Liquor Barn in October.
   In recent weeks, contract talks between Liquor Barn and
its food union employees have stalled. Mr. Zell said that
Liquor Barn management has proposed "a long list of
takeaways" and "is trying to deprive members of union
representation." The workers' contract expired last month.
   Mitchell Woodbury, vice president and corporate counsel
for Triton and Intermark, said that Triton "has been
bargaining in good faith." The merger proposal is "fair, just
and equitable" to shareholders of both companies, he said.
   Mr. Woodbury said Triton has rejected requests by the
union for the company's shareholder lists "as not being made
in compliance with applicable law." Local 1119 purchased
advertising space in this newspaper to urge shareholders to
vote against the merger. Shareholders will vote on the
proposal at Triton's annual meeting Aug. 30.
