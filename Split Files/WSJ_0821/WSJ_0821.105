   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- The U.S. has moved a
contingent of Air Force transport planes to this tiny kingdom
and has received pledges of military cooperation from Oman
and Qatar, illustrating America's newfound acceptance in
parts of the Arab world.
   A fleet of 16 C-130 aircraft and nearly 600 Air Force
personnel secretly were moved here a week ago from Little
Rock, Ark., to participate in the enormous airlift of troops
and war materiel into Saudi Arabia. The arrangement was
announced yesterday during a visit here by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney.

   Its significance extends beyond speeding the movement of
cargo. The sudden and now publicly acknowledged presence of
U.S. forces in the United Arab Emirates, which had
consistently rebuffed such requests over the years,
demonstrates the sharp and perhaps long-lasting change in
America's role in the entire region following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   "It is a big step for the emirate" and "a number of
governments in the Gulf to invite United States forces in,"
Secretary Cheney told reporters after meeting at the
presidential palace with Sheik Zayid, ruler of the U.A.E.
   "They are deeply concerned that their very existence is
threatened by Saddam Hussein," Mr. Cheney said, and are
"eager to cooperate with the U.S." and other Arab governments
to ensure that the Iraqi president doesn't advance any
farther.
   Secretary Cheney is discussing possible arms sales with
several other countries in the region, and military officials
said Oman already is a busy transshipment point for the U.S.
military buildup in Saudi Arabia. In addition, Qatar has
agreed in principle to allow U.S. planes there during a
crisis.
   Mr. Cheney met with the rulers of Oman and Qatar during
his tour, before heading for sessions with Saudi Arabia's
King Fahd and other Saudi officials.
   Mr. Cheney's hectic flights crisscrossing the Middle East
illustrate his increasingly important diplomatic role to
isolate Iraq's Hussein, while the U.S. builds up its naval
forces and ground troops in Saudi Arabia.
   The United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have all pledged
to send troops into Saudi Arabia, and their air bases and
harbors are important to keep supplies moving steadily. Use
of airports in the Persian Gulf countries also would provide
U.S. airmen emergency landing strips if shooting breaks out,
an official traveling with Mr. Cheney said.
   Mr. Cheney's comments reflected the sea change affecting
the region. Amid the splendor of Abu Dhabi's seaside palace,
decked with marble and an ornate rug as large as a tennis
court, the secretary emphasized that "our defensive efforts
of the past few weeks apply to all our friends in the Gulf."
He is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the U.A.E.
in its 18-year history.
   Later, standing in the 110-degree weather, Mr. Cheney
talked about the potential for longer-term military ties.
Countries in the region "are now prepared to actively engage
with us to enhance their security," including buying
"additional equipment if that's what they need," he told
reporters.
   For the airmen who work in a rickety hangar and sleep
packed together in makeshift air-conditioned trailers put up
by the U.A.E in 48 hours, short-term concerns are paramount.
"We slept in the hangar the first night, on the floor," said
Col. Richard Pluchinsky, a Vietnam veteran who now serves as
the unit's operations officer. "Right now we can sustain our
operation for 30 days" without receiving additional spare
parts or other materiel from the U.S.
   Despite the immense logistical problems, the colonel said
morale is pretty good. "The flyers want to fly. The
maintainers want to fix," he said.
   After looking over the primitive living conditions for
U.S. military personnel in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Cheney said the
American people must understand that "we are here because we
need to be here." The Bush administration, he said, is
committed "to stay as long as we're needed and as long as
we're wanted. That is what I have told to troops, too."
