   Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" is a delightful piece of
fiction . . . and so was your recent July 30 page-one article
about Peterborough, N.H.
   Your selection of sources resulted in a distinctly
one-sided portrayal of the town's relationship with Minebea
Co., owner of the New Hampshire Ball Bearing plant here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tone of the piece, in fact, reflected a preconceived
bias against small towns and their adjustments to changes in
management of local companies. Further, it was written in the
unfortunate tradition of Japan-bashing articles that have
become all too popular in recent years.
   The article implied NHBB is strictly bottom-line-oriented,
having little interest in the community, but this is not
borne out by the facts. The company has been actively
involved in community and regional affairs for years.
   Certainly there are adjustments to be made under the new
ownership, but change is inevitable with the passage of time
and evolving business conditions.
   Let's keep Thornton Wilder's work as great entertainment
and let the Peterboroughs of the nation find their way of
dealing with new management in their vital industries.

   Peterborough's business community is much more than just
Minebea's NH Ball Bearings subsidiary. There is certainly a
small-town flavor that natives and more recent arrivals
cherish. I've enjoyed this community since moving here in
1975 as founding editor and co-owner of my first major
magazine, BYTE. Numerous businesses large and small find this
kind of small town quite acceptable.
   Our town's publishing industry alone employs hundreds of
people. Our economy is much more balanced than a single
manufacturing company recently acquired by new owners.
Peterborough, N.H., co-exists with and trades quite well with
a global world of commerce.
