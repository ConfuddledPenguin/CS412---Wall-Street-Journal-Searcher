   TEL AVIV -- Israelis flocked as usual to the azure waters
of the Mediterranean here, but beneath the colorful beach
umbrellas the talk seemed to be of only one subject: war.
   "It feels like the quiet before the storm," said Orly
Vilenski, 26 years old, applying a coat of suntan lotion
before attending to the pressing issues of geopolitics. "Me,
I'm not worried, because I'm going with my whole family on
holiday to New York next week. But my friends have been
joking that we should call first before coming home, just to
make sure Israel still exists."

   With gallows humor, macho swagger, and carefully phrased
official statements, Israel is walking a fine line between
preparedness and panic as the escalation in the Persian Gulf
continues.
   During the weekend, tension mounted when two armed
Jordanian soldiers, described by Israel's government radio
station as "Moslem extremists who hoped to carry out an
attack on Israel in solidarity with Saddam Hussein,"
infiltrated Israel's border. Israeli army troops killed one
and wounded the other, who was taken for questioning.
Jordan's Radio Amman noted that the two soldiers had been
"missing from base," suggesting their absence was
unauthorized.
   The incident served to underline Israel's sense of
vulnerability. Israeli officials, who had been striving with
U.S. encouragement to maintain a low profile in an effort not
to be drawn into the Gulf conflict, began to sound more
alarmist.
   "Personally," said a senior government official who asked
not to be named, "I now think there will have to be a war."
He added, "It's getting more and more dangerous every day.
The entire region is now a powder keg." Israel's
government-run radio news sounded a similar note, stating
that "senior government officials" have concluded that "war
in the Gulf is now inevitable."
   These officials argue that given his past record, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is unlikely to respond to diplomatic
overtures or to be frightened by military deterrents. But the
Israeli analysis may be colored by the preference of many
officials that Saddam Hussein be eliminated from Middle East
politics -- especially if it can be done by a nation other
than Israel.
   A number of senior Israeli officials, particularly in the
Defense Ministry, hope that the U.S. will conduct massive air
and missile strikes against Iraq. The alternative -- a slow
war of nerves -- may allow further spread of Arab nationalism
and unrest, increasing the likelihood of instability in such
moderate Arab states as Jordan, they argue.
   "The West must stop {Saddam Hussein}" argued one such
senior Israeli official. "Otherwise he will simply try this
again in another eight years."
   Some Israeli officials worry that Saddam Hussein, if
cornered, may see an attack on Israel as his best shot at
uniting Arab allies. One official calls this the "Samson and
Delilah scenario," in which Saddam Hussein pulls the pillars
down on all his enemies rather than surrender.
   Whether Israel might be drawn into any military conflict
is a matter of debate here. Military analysts and
policy-makers believe Saddam Hussein would like to portray
his invasion of Kuwait as an Arab fight against Israel. They
are determined not to give him the opportunity, unless Iraq
threatens Israel directly or places troops in Jordan. In an
attempt to appear uninvolved and peaceful, Israel hasn't
called up most of its military reserves, though officials
confirm that some air force reservists were called into
service and that anti-missile batteries have been massed on
the Jordanian border.
   The army has also refused to distribute gas masks to
civilians, despite a clamor from those fearing Iraqi chemical
warfare. Some Israeli politicians, including Foreign Minister
David Levy, have called for immediate distribution. An
Israeli lawyer frustrated by the army's refusal took the
issue to court, where a judge will decide on it later this
week.
   Meanwhile local papers have begun to carry accounts of
runs on baking soda, a homemade remedy against poisonous gas,
as well as accounts of people stocking up on such staples as
rice, sugar and oil. One newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, alerted
readers to such early signs of chemical attack as the sudden
death of "foliage and small pets."
   At the beach here, people most fear the threat of chemical
weapons. Yuda Baker, a Tel Aviv diamond merchant, worries
that gas masks will be distributed only to soldiers. "I want
my family and other civilians protected," he says. "They may
be in real trouble."
   Tippi Wall, 32, a teacher, says, "I think war is coming.
Every day I have more and more fear. It's getting very hot."
Calling for a pre-emptive strike, as do many on the beach,
she says, "I think we should attack Iraq first. Saddam
Hussein is a murderer. He wants to rule the whole Arab
world."
   Up in the lifeguards' hut, the mood is even more macho.
Ron Wohlberg, 32, flexes his biceps and from the shade of his
sunglasses suggests, "I'm not afraid, why should I be? I
think Saddam Hussein will lose. The Americans will finish him
off. And if they don't, we will."
   Betty Merion, a tourist from Philadelphia, doesn't want to
take any chances. "It's been a great trip," she says, "but
I'm happy to be going home. We've been lucky, but I don't
want to push my luck."
