   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Varian Associates Inc. said it signed
"a multimillion dollar" pact with the Soviet Union to supply
cancer radiotherapy systems to several treatment centers.
   The order includes a range of cancer therapy equipment,
including linear accelerators to deliver precise doses of
radiation, radiotherapy simulators, therapy planning
computers and radiotherapy management systems.

   The first of the new systems was installed in early summer
at Moscow's All Union Oncology Center, the company said in a
news release. The other four cancer centers will receive
equipment next year, it said.
