   MILAN, Italy -- A Milanese stockbrokers' committee met to
try to avert the forced liquidation of stock held by
Commissionaria Lombardfin S.p.A.
   The meeting was amid concern that time may be running out
for a solution to the brokerage's problems, which contributed
to a further plunge on the Milan Stock Exchange.

   Lombardfin problems stem from its purchase of a 32% stake
in Partecipazioni Finanziarie &amp; Industriali (PAF), 52%-owned
by Gianni Varasi and his family. Italian press reports have
put the value of that purchase at about 100 billion lire ($88
million).
   Lombardfin's difficulties have been public knowledge for
several weeks. But the situation worsened Friday when a group
of creditor banks was unable to agree to roll over loans that
Lombardfin had taken to help finance the acquisition of the
PAF stake.
   The Varasi family's majority stake apparently leaves
Lombardfin's holding with little strategic value.
   Bruno Pazzi, the newly appointed president of Consob, the
Milan stock market's regulatory body, has made it clear that
he regards a forced liquidation of the broker's portfolio as
a last resort, and would prefer that a compromise be reached.
   PAF shares fell a further 3% to 4,900 lire ($4.29)
yesterday after shedding nearly 20% in panic selling Friday
on news of the impasse between Lombardfin and its banks.
