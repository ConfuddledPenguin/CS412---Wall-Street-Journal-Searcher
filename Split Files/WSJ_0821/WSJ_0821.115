   HARLEYSVILLE, Pa. -- Harleysville Group Inc. and its
parent company, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., announced
an agreement to acquire the property and casualty insurance
operations of USLICO Corp., for $135 million in cash and
securities.
   Under the agreement, Harleysville Group and Harleysville
Mutual will purchase all of the capital stock issued and
outstanding of Hawkeye Insurance, based in Des Moines, Iowa,
and its consolidated subsidiaries: United Security Insurance
Co., also based in Des Moines, and Western States Insurance
Co., based in Freeport, Ill.

   The transaction price of $135 million will consist of a
cash payment of $110 million, of which $93 million will be
contributed by Harleysville Group, which is a publicly traded
company. Harleysville Mutual will contribute $17 million and
will issue a $25 million, seven-year, 10% note to USLICO.
Immediately prior to the closing of the deal, Hawkeye will
return to USLICO 500,000 common shares of USLICO.
   Bradford W. Mitchell, chairman and chief executive officer
of Harleysville Group, said that the acquisition may have a
moderately dilutive effect on the company's per-share
earnings next year and in 1992, but that it "will have an
anti-dilutive effect on our earnings after that time."
   Mr. Mitchell said the acquisition of USLICO's
property-casualty business will help Harleysville continue
its strategic plan to build its national network of regional
insurance companies. The acquisition will give Harleysville,
which now operates four regional property-casualty insurers
that cover the East Coast, a new presence in Midwest and
Western states. The company will have operations in 34
states, up from 19.
   In a separate but related transaction, Harleysville Mutual
will sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Harleysville Life
Insurance Co., to USLICO for a $17 million, seven-year, 10%
note that Harleysville will hold in its investment portfolio.
