   NEW YORK -- Paramount Communications Inc. said Michael S.
Hope, an executive vice president, will leave the company at
fiscal year end on Oct. 31 to pursue other opportunities.
   Mr. Hope, 48 years old and one of two executive vice
presidents at Paramount, oversees planning and operations,
and played a large role in restructuring the company from a
conglomerate into a trimmer concern focused on entertainment
and publishing. He said he made "a personal decision" to
leave, now that the restructuring is complete.

   Some analysts said Mr. Hope also may have seen little
opportunity for advancement at Paramount, a highly
decentralized company run by Martin S. Davis, chairman and
chief executive officer, who doesn't have a clear No. 2
executive.
   Formerly a partner at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young,
Mr. Hope joined Paramount in 1983 as chief financial officer
and was named to his current post four years later. His
duties will be assumed by Paramount's chief financial
officer, Ronald L. Nelson, 38.
