   Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil-rights group,
declined to end its national boycott of Nike Inc. products
despite the company's announcement Friday of new
affirmative-action goals.
   The Beaverton, Ore., athletic apparel company's new goals
include naming a minority to the Nike board, increasing the
number of non-white department heads by 10% within 12 months
and naming a minority vice president within 24 months.

   Rev. Tyrone Crider, director of PUSH, called Nike's goals
"inadequate." He repeated PUSH's demand that Nike use
minority-owned banks, advertising agencies and other service
companies.
   "The boycott and blackout campaign against Nike has not
ended. In fact, our efforts have intensified," he said.
   Operation PUSH has called for the boycott because it says
that Nike gets about 30% of its $2.4 billion of annual
revenue from black customers, but invests little in the black
community and has no high-level black employees.
   Nike says it gets closer to 15% of its revenue from
blacks. It has defended its policies and has alleged that
PUSH has financial connections with rival athletic wear
company Reebok International Ltd. PUSH has denied the
allegation.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Nike shares closed
at $73.25, down $2.25.
