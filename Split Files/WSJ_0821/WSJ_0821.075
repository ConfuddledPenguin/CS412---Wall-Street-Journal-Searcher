   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. appointed three new
division presidents: Jonathan C. Crane, president of the
Northeast division; Gregory A. LeVert, Midwest division; and
Douglas L. Maine, Southeast division.
   Mr. Crane, who had been Southeast division president,
succeeds Nathan Kantor, who announced his resignation to
start a business telecommunications service company. Ronald
E. Spears, who has been president of the Midwest division
since 1985, also announced his resignation; the company said
he decided against a new job within MCI that would have
required a move from Chicago. Messrs. Kantor and Spears will
continue with MCI until the end of the year to ensure a
smooth transition.
