   CAMDEN, N.J. -- John W. Argabright, senior vice president
of Campbell Soup Co. and president of its international
division, decided to retire early.
   Mr. Argabright, who will turn 55 years old in October,
joined Campbell in 1986 as a vice president and took charge
of the international division. The group of businesses hasn't
been a bright spot for the food products company in recent
years.

   In late May, Campbell put its least profitable foreign
operations on the block, conceding that these businesses
can't deliver adequate returns to shareholders. The move also
is part of Campbell's companywide cost-cutting measures.
   Among the businesses for sale are Campbell's British
frozen vegetable and seafood lines of its Freshbake Foods
unit and its Italian cookie company, D. Lazzaroni &amp; Co.,
which has been plagued with production and distribution
problems.
   Mr. Argabright said his retirement will take effect when a
successor is named. While he plans to spend more time with
his family, he said, he also wants to return to his "first
love -- consumer marketing and advertising."
