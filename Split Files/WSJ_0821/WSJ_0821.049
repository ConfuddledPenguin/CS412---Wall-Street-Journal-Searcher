   MONTREAL -- One of Canada's two main East-West railroad
lines reopened and the second was expected to reopen soon.
   Government-owned Canadian National Railways said freight
began moving Sunday night on a segment of its
transcontinental route in northern Ontario. The track had
been blocked for a week by native Indian protesters who were
seeking action on land claims and other issues.

   Meanwhile, Canadian Pacific Ltd. said its CP Rail unit
obtained a court injunction ordering a separate group of
Indians to end a blockade on a segment of its main
transcontinental route. A CP Rail spokesman said he couldn't
say when the track would reopen but added that the railroad
is confident the Indians will obey the injunction. The CP
Rail blockade began last Thursday.
