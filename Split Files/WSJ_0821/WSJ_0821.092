   BOSTON -- When Harris Leviton was looking for an analyst's
job in 1987, he jumped at the chance to work for Fidelity
Investments, the U.S.'s largest mutual fund group.
   "Some of the other places I interviewed wouldn't let you
near money for three or four years, sometimes even a decade,"
says Mr. Leviton, who was recently chosen to run the $62
million Fidelity Convertible Securities fund.

   Not so at Fidelity, where an analyst often is running one
of Fidelity's 38 Select portfolios within two years of
arriving at the Boston-based firm. Select portfolios, which
are volatile mutual funds that invest in a single industry,
are one of the fund industry's most controversial products.
But for young analysts eager to manage money, they are a
godsend.
   The Select funds are part of Fidelity's strategy for
attracting and nurturing novice stock pickers. William Hayes,
the firm's director of fixed-income research, says: "You're
not going to sit on the bench for years, hoping that some
senior portfolio manager is going to get hit by a bus."
   The prevailing assumption at Fidelity is that if you hire
analysts who are young and bright and give them lots of
responsibility, and if they work harder than the competition,
this will translate into better performance for Fidelity's
stock funds.
   Now that top stock-picker Peter Lynch has retired as fund
manager of Fidelity Magellan, the quality of Fidelity's
research department is more important than ever. Fidelity
needs to convince investors that -- even without Mr. Lynch --
the firm can continue to generate stellar investment results.
   Fidelity does attract "younger, more aggressive, more
arrogant people who are very smart," says Eric Kobren, editor
of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter on Fidelity
published in Wellesley, Mass. "They attract a Morris Smith
{the new manager of Fidelity Magellan} or a Beth Terrana
{manager of Fidelity Growth &amp; Income}, who are in their early
30s and work 80 hours a week and are constantly on airplanes
flying off to visit companies."
   All told, Fidelity's stock-picking department employs 105
analysts and fund managers. According to Fidelity, that makes
it the country's largest "buy-side" research department.
   But is Fidelity's research department really that good? If
the performance of Fidelity's stock funds is any guide, it
seems so. Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., a Boston mutual-fund
research firm, puts Fidelity in the top 10% of all fund
groups, based on the performance of its stock funds over one,
three, five and 10 years. Kanon Bloch's ratings give equal
weighting to all funds, so the results aren't skewed by
Magellan's huge size.
   Fidelity Select was the brainchild of Edward C. Johnson
III, chairman and owner of 47% of closely held Fidelity
Investments. His daughter, Abigail, now manages two Select
portfolios. Mr. Lynch, who initially oversaw the Select funds
as head of the growth stock group, was one of Select's
earliest backers.
   Since Fidelity launched its first four Select portfolios
in 1981, they have often been criticized as poor investment
vehicles. Because Select portfolios concentrate on a single
industry, the funds frequently are volatile. They often grace
the top of the quarterly and one-year fund performance charts
-- but can also be found languishing at the bottom. Despite
criticism, Fidelity has continued to add Select portfolios,
arguing that the funds are useful for those who want to
invest actively in the stock market without actually picking
stocks.
   "From a public relations standpoint, it's done some
damage," says Mr. Kobren, the newsletter writer. "But it's
also attracted a new breed of fund investor who was
previously at Merrill Lynch buying individual stocks."
   As a way of attracting new investors, the Select funds
have only been a modest success. The funds range in size from
the $313 million Health fund to Life Insurance and
Automotive, with assets of only $500,000 each. Fidelity
Magellan, by contrast, boasts $13 billion in assets. In all,
the Select funds account for less than 6% of Fidelity's total
stock fund assets of $43 billion.
   But pulling in money isn't the only role for the Select
funds. They also act as a proving ground for Fidelity's
analysts and generate investment ideas that can be used by
the stock-pickers who run Fidelity's large, diversified stock
funds. The Select portfolios are managed by 25 fund managers,
mostly young analysts whom Fidelity has recruited from the
top business schools. Fidelity analysts have an average age
of 33 and typically start at salaries of $55,000 or $60,000 a
year.
   For Select managers, the ultimate goal is to run one of
the big, diversified mutual funds. Many young analysts "think
they'll blow the world away," says Fidelity's Mr. Hayes, who
is heavily involved in recruiting new analysts. "If you
really are that good, you will move up quickly here."
   There are two ways for Select managers to stand out. One
way is to turn in a good performance with their Select fund.
Because a Select manager's fate is closely tied to his
sector, the fund's performance is rated by comparing it with
a benchmark index for the sector.
   But far more important are the investment ideas that a
Select manager feeds to the managers of Fidelity's large,
diversified funds. Fidelity's analysts provide around half
the stock ideas used by the bigger funds.
   A Select fund manager "who sits in their office and beats
their benchmark by 90% a year but doesn't talk to the
diversified fund managers isn't doing us any good at all,"
says Richard Spillane, who oversees the Select funds. "The
worst thing is if they have a great stock in their Select
fund and they don't tell the diversified fund managers."
   At Fidelity, a new analyst doesn't sit on the sidelines
for long. "My second week here, I walked into Peter Lynch's
office," recalls Lawrence Bowman, who manages two Select
portfolios, computers and technology. "He was a god to me. I
walked in and said, `I think you should buy this stock.' He
picked up the phone and bought some right there. It blew me
away."
   Not all Mr. Bowman's picks have panned out. A year ago, he
had been recommending Sun Microsystems Inc. when the earnings
outlook turned sour and Sun slipped from $23 a share to below
$13.50. "We were loaded to the gills," recalls Mr. Bowman.
"We owned a couple of million of shares going into this. I
loved it. I was sure I was right."
   But Mr. Bowman adds: "There isn't a person here who hasn't
made a big mistake."
   At Fidelity, picking a few bum stocks is expected. Not
admitting to mistakes is another matter. "What portfolio
managers don't like is that you put them in a stock and then
it goes down and you don't talk about it," says Deborah
Wheeler, who runs Fidelity Select-Retail. "Peter {Lynch}
hated that."
   A Select manager's biggest headache used to be managing
the fund's cash flow, as shareholders rushed to withdraw
money or bought in like crazy. Ms. Wheeler was running Select
Housing when the bond market tanked in April 1987. Over the
next month, investors -- fearful that a spike in interest
rates would damage home sales -- redeemed away half of the
fund's $50 million in assets.
   Last November, Fidelity moved to curb big cash movements
by charging $7.50 plus a 0.75% redemption fee for switches
made within 29 days. Cash flows now are far less drastic, but
Select managers still have to suffer through nail-biting
market swings.
   "We all commiserate when our sector is doing poorly, and
we have fun when our sector is doing well," says Lawrence
Greenberg, who runs two Select portfolios and is an assistant
to Magellan's Morris Smith. "There's only so much you can do
when your sector is in the tank."
   Fidelity already offers small investors 80 stock funds,
but the firm will have to add more if it's going to
accommodate the aspirations of Mr. Greenberg and other Select
managers. Mr. Hayes, the director of fixed-income research,
says that won't be a problem. He predicts that, just as there
now are funds that invest in distinct parts of the U.S. stock
market, so that sort of specialization is likely to spread
among funds that invest abroad.
   Even with Mr. Lynch gone, Mr. Hayes figures Fidelity will
go on producing stellar results. He likes to point out that
Fidelity (or Fido, as the firm is known among employees) has
survived the departure of other top stock-pickers. When Mr.
Hayes joined in 1969, the company was still feeling the loss
of star fund manager Gerald Tsai, who had left three years
earlier to start his own fund.
   "Gerry Tsai was the wunderkind at Fidelity in the 1960s,"
Mr. Hayes recalls. "When I arrived here, people were
wondering what would happen to Fidelity after Gerald Tsai.
Peter {Lynch} was a singular dimension at Fidelity. But life
goes on."
