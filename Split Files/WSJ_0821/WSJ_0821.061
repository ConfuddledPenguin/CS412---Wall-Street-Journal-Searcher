   NEW YORK -- A stalemate in the desert means a narrow
trading range for stocks on Wall Street.
   That's how analysts and traders alike described
yesterday's trading activity and summed up expectations for
the foreseeable future.

   While stock market averages strained to register moderate
gains, most stocks ended lower or unchanged.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 11.64 points to
2656.44, largely due to gains in oil stocks. Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.68 to 328.51, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.23 to 180.42, and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.26 to 304.00.
   But the averages belied the underlying weakness evident in
the market's breadth. Only 629 issues advanced while 920
issues declined and 457 issues ended unchanged. Volume on the
Big Board slumped to 129,630,000 issues, from 212,560,000
shares on Friday.
   "{The activity} could hardly be viewed as a rally," said
Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at First
Boston.
   Dale Tills, manager of institutional equities trading at
Charles Schwab, said investors are likely to take any
strength as an opportunity to sell, which should keep the
market trading in a range between 2620 and 2660, he said.
   But Mr. Grigoli was less optimistic, saying he expects the
market will continue to move lower in the months ahead as the
impact of oil prices is felt further.
   "I'm looking for the Dow {industrials} to move closer to
the 2500 level in the next few months," Mr. Grigoli says.
   In the meantime, the price of oil will likely determine
the daily swing in prices.
   "Oil to bonds to stocks," is how Kidder Peabody's Stefan
Abrams describes the link between oil and share prices.
   Oil issues rose along with crude-oil futures. Chevron rose
1 3/8 to 80; Exxon added 5/8 to 52 3/4; Texaco rose 1 3/4 to
65 5/8; USX, which owns Marathon Oil, rose 5/8 to 33 1/8; and
Du Pont, which owns Conoco, added 1/4 to 37 5/8.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Grigoli says, every day that the Federal
Reserve doesn't act to ease credit, the market falls further
toward a recession.
   "It would take a significant easing at this point, perhaps
as much as 100 basis points on the federal funds rate," the
rate at which banks loan money to each other overnight, to
revive the economy, he says. A basis point is 1/100th of a
percentage point.
   Mr. Grigoli has advised maintaining cash levels of 25%
since earlier this year, and he doesn't expect to commit any
of that cash to the market soon.
   "The earliest that a significant, sustained rally could
develop in the market would be November or December," he
says.
   He advises emphasizing multinational consumer growth
stocks in order to weather a recession. The earnings of
companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, Philip Morris, and PepsiCo
should remain stable even if the economy doesn't, he says, in
part because of their exposure in European and Far Eastern
markets, where economic activity may remain stronger than in
the U.S.
   But even if the Federal Reserve can steer the economy
through the obstacles presented by higher oil prices and
falling corporate profits, most analysts agree that a
standoff in the Middle East will keep a cap on stock prices.
   Among other oil stocks, Pogo Producing rose 7/8 to 8 1/2,
while Permian Basin Royalty Trust added 3/8 to 5 7/8.
   Harken Energy fell 5/8 to 2 3/8 after reporting a second
quarter loss of 73 cents a share, compared to profit of 7
cents a share in the year-ago quarter after a tax credit.
   Atlantic Richfield gained 1 5/8 to 139 1/8. The oil
company said it will maintain its freeze on gas prices, but
raise prices for diesel and jet fuel.
   British Petroleum slid 1 1/8 to 84 7/8. The company said
it will auction off its gas exploration and production
holding company in the Netherlands. Analysts estimate that
the unit could fetch between $60 million and $70 million.
   Gitano Group was the most striking decliner, plunging 4
7/8 to 19 3/8 on more than 10 times normal volume after
Goldman Sachs analyst Jay Meltzer reduced his earnings
estimates for the company, citing increasing competition in
the retail apparel industry. Mr. Meltzer reduced his 1990
outlook to $2.50 a share from $2.90, and his 1991 estimate to
$3 from $3.40.
   UAL edged up 3 to 104 1/2 while other airline stocks were
lower on rising fuel prices. The leader of the union group
trying to finance a $201-a-share buyout of UAL is scheduled
to meet this week with top Japanese bank officials, according
to the American Banker.
   AMR also rose, adding 1/8 to 47 5/8. The company's AMR
Eagle regional airline division is nearing completion of
negotiations for the purchase of as many as 100 aircraft
valued at about $800 million.
   Capital Cities/ABC added 4 to 508. The company is expected
to benefit from sharply higher ratings for its ABC evening
newscasts since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Texas Utilities added 1/8 to 35 7/8, leading the most
active list in dividend related trading.
   Federal National Mortgage Association fell 1 1/8 to 29
3/4. On Friday, the company released data that shows a key
measure of its profitability was unchanged in July. The
profit measure, the yield spread between Fannie Mae's
mortgage assets above its debt costs, was unchanged at 94
basis points in July.
   WorldCorp added 7/8, or nearly 18%, to 5 3/4. Attention
may have been brought to the stock by a newspaper article
over the weekend that says the company may benefit from the
military's airlift of soldiers and materiel to the Persian
Gulf. WorldCorp provides cargo and passenger charters to the
military and commercial customers.
   H.H. Robertson fell 7/8 to 9 3/4 following the death of a
major dissident shareholder. Anthone Pedone, who died on
Friday, held about half of the 15.9% stake controlled by the
dissident shareholder group known as H.H.R. Acquisition Corp.
The dissident group says, however, that it hasn't changed its
plans to wage a proxy contest to oppose management on certain
issues related to Robertson's merger with Ceco Industries
Inc.
   Weyerhaeuser added 3/4 to 21 1/2 after announcing that it
will resume the repurchase of its stock.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 2.32
to 331.29. Volume totaled 11,770,000 shares.
