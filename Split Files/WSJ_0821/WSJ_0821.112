   USX, Unlike Most Oil-Related Companies,
   Hasn't Benefited From Persian Gulf Conflict

   PITTSBURGH -- In the nearly three weeks since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, just about everything associated with the
oil business has shot up in price. Everything, that is,
except USX stock.
   The nation's largest steelmaker, USX is also a major oil
company, through its Marathon Oil Co. unit. And Marathon
generated 55% of USX's pretax operating profit in 1989, up
from 36% in 1988. So USX stock might seem likely to be a big
beneficiary of the Persian Gulf hostilities. The crisis has
sent crude oil prices soaring 40%, to more than $28 a barrel,
as gasoline prices have ratcheted upward.

   Yet USX hasn't been caught up in Wall Street's newfound
fervor for oil stocks. The major oil stocks in the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index are up nearly 11% from the start of July,
bucking an 8% market decline. USX shares have barely budged
in the period. And at yesterday's close of 33 1/8, USX is
actually down 3% from the day before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   The stock is dropping in part because investors worry
about the impact of a weak economy on the steel industry,
itself a big energy consumer. Steel is used in a lot of
recession-vulnerable products, notably autos and appliances.
If a recession develops, steel companies probably won't be
able to make recent price increases stick. Even more
troubling to investors is the possibility of a steel labor
strike; the USX contract has less than a half year to run.
   USX itself seems bewildered by the stock's behavior. Rex
Cooley, senior vice president and comptroller of USX, notes
that a $1-a-barrel rise in crude oil translates into $70
million pretax profit on an annualized basis for USX's oil
exploration and production segment. With crude oil up more
than $8 a barrel, the company's net income could be boosted
by roughly $305 million, or $1.20 a share annually.
   In the analysts' camp, George Gaspar of R.W. Baird has
raised his 1990 profit estimate for USX to $3.25 a share from
$2.75. Besides benefiting from higher prices for crude, he
says, Marathon should be able to increase production 3% to 5%
in the second half. Marathon had strong operating earnings in
the first half, posting an 11.8% rise from a year earlier to
a record level.
   Yet most analysts aren't changing their opinions of the
stock. Independent analyst Charles Bradford maintains a
neutral rating, saying the oil crisis hasn't allayed concerns
that Carl Icahn may dump his 13.3% stake in USX.
   A gloating Carl Icahn says the stock is being penalized by
the USX's role as the nation's No. 1 steelmaker. "People who
like oil don't buy it and people who like steel don't buy
it," he says. "It's neither fish nor fowl. Furthermore,
Marathon's future as a domestic oil producer hinges on
capital investment, which now must be shared with a
capital-consuming steel business, he says.
   In May, Mr. Icahn lost a proxy battle in which he sought
shareholder support for a spinoff of at least 80% of the
steel business. If USX had spun off steel, he insists now,
the stock would be "significantly higher." USX declined to
comment on his remarks.
   Robin Shoemaker at Shearson Lehman says a separate
Marathon Oil would trade at between $30 and $33 a share, with
steel trading at perhaps $8. The analyst says the stock's
weakness "puts more pressure on management to take some
action to separate Marathon from steel." USX has said that it
would consider reducing its exposure to steel through a
complete or partial sale, more joint ventures or an initial
public offering of as much as 20% of the steel operation. But
Chairman Charles A. Corry indicated earlier this month that
the company had nothing major in the works.
   Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst with PaineWebber, says
that even though a stand-alone oil company would be valued at
more after the invasion, a stand-alone steel company would be
less. Overall, "I don't know if they necessarily would be
better off," he says.
   As for USX, he thinks the poor performance reflects
several factors, including the presence of Mr. Icahn. "People
are afraid he's going to cut a deal for himself," the analyst
says. He also thinks investors were disappointed that the
company could sell only 30% of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas
exploration and production properties.
   Meanwhile, steel analysts say investors are worried about
approaching talks with the United Steelworkers union, whose
contract expires in January. During 1986 contract
negotiations, USX weathered a protracted strike.
   "The perception is that it might be difficult to
renegotiate that contract," says Leo Larkin, who follows
steel for Standard &amp; Poor's. "And that prevents USX stock
from benefiting from the rise in oil prices."
