   EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE plans gain increasing favor, to help
control drug use.
   Rehabilitating drug users can make drug testing more
acceptable, by showing that firing or discipline isn't
inevitable, says John Tysse of the Labor Policy Association,
an employer group. Union Carbide's employee assistance
program went national in 1988. The program shines "a better
light" on testing; the company says it wouldn't test without
it. Boeing revises its policy to stress rehabilitation, not
just testing, to curb drug abuse.

   Consultant Towers Perrin says assistance programs are
gaining credibility for "detection and management" of drug
and other worker problems. Both Mobil and Campbell Soup
strongly emphasize counseling for drug users, but insist
they're not doing so in order to sell testing. Mobil moves
more vigorously to use its plan to stop and treat drug abuse.
Valley Bank says its supportive get-help policy has made drug
testing a "non-event" with employees.
   American Airlines says assistance plans are more effective
than testing in attempts to curb drug abuse.
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYERS FEAR huge legal problems from new civil-rights
rules.
   If legislation due to emerge from Congress soon becomes
law, new punitive and other damages and jury trials would
spur litigation, says the Equal Employment Advisory Council,
an employer group. It says the bill, aimed at countering 1989
Supreme Court rulings that limited rights of plaintiffs in
race and sex discrimination cases, also promises "confusion"
over "well settled" issues. Labor attorney Victor Schachter
says employers will defensively resume "hiring by the
numbers."
   Banc One says it is preparing for any new law by making
sure it can prove lack of bias in hiring and firing. Keithley
Instruments, an electronics-gear firm, worries about zealous
enforcement. Bank of America says the law could boost many
firms' court costs, but not its own. A Bush veto could block
the bill, but many firms worry some version of it may become
law.
                                                                                                       

   FACTORY PRODUCTIVITY in the U.S. lags still more behind
other nations.
   Output per hour gained only 2% among U.S. manufacturers in
1989, exceeding only Sweden's 1.6% rise among 11 industrial
countries, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Nine other
nations topped the U.S., led by gains of 6.4% in Norway, 5.8%
in Japan and 5.1% in the United Kingdom. U.S. productivity
increases had tied for fifth among 12 nations from 1979
through 1987, but the U.S. rise in 1988 fell to 10th among
the 12.
   The U.S. has lost much of its cost advantage, too. Its
2.2% rise in unit labor costs was seventh among 13 nations
analyzed by the bureau, with the Netherlands, Norway and
France scoring cost declines. Korea's 13.6% rise was the
largest. In unit labor cost increases, the U.S. was 11th and
seventh among 14 countries in 1979-1987 and in 1988,
respectively.
   U.S. productivity won't keep up if U.S. workers aren't
trained to make decisions, the National Center on Education
and the Economy warns.
                                                                                                       

   THE THREAT OF WAR with Iraq may undercut industrial
unions' lobbying for a U.S. policy to cushion the impact of
military budget cuts on defense-plant workers. Machinists
union President George Kourpias is "scared stiff" that
legislators now won't listen, but he'll keep at it.
                                                                                                       

   THE BIG SLIDE: Labor unions in manufacturing suffered
their largest membership decline in three years in 1989, a
study by consultant Grant Thornton shows. Membership fell
3.2% to 4.6 million from 4.8 million, mainly due to rising
demand for people with high-tech skills and  a shrinking
market for low-tech workers, the most unionized, the firm
says.
                                                                                                       

   MASS LAYOFFS rose 14% in 1989 from 1988, with 2,762 layoff
actions reported, affecting 572,143 workers, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics said. But a separate BLS survey showed
worker displacement over five years from plant closings,
employers moving, staff cuts and like reasons easing by
300,000 from levels in a similar 1988 survey.
                                                                                                       

   ETHICS ARE LACKING in business, these working women
report.
   In a survey of 1,400 women by Working Woman magazine, from
52% to 70% said they've witnessed managers' lying to
employees, expense-account abuses at high levels, office
favoritism or nepotism and taking credit for others' work.
Fully 53% agreed that most successful business people must
sometimes fudge principles to get ahead. And 78% of women who
feel they're "highly successful" were more willing to bend
and break rules than others.
   Just 37% of women who took an ethical stand say it helped
their careers; 30% say it hurt. Over 60% would use a secret
report stolen from a competitor. Fully 66% have "no problem"
with a salesperson giving costly gifts to sales prospects.
Flirting to make a sale was known by 43%, sex with a client
by 10%, with the boss by 29%.
   The most unethical behavior occurs in government, said
66%; sales, 51%; law, 40%; the media, 38%; finance, 33%;
medicine, 21%; banking, 18%; manufacturing, 14%.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: The Senior Baseball Union represents former
major leaguers over 35 years old who can't put down gloves,
in a Sun Belt winter league. . . . Marketing and sales
surpass finance and accounting, the 1979 leader, as the
fastest route to top management, a study by consultant
Korn/Ferry and the UCLA graduate school of management finds.

   AMERICA WEST AIRLINES said employee assistance programs
are more effective than random drug testing in attempts to
curb drug abuse. The comment was incorrectly attributed to
AMR Corp.'s American Airlines in Tuesday's edition.
