   CHICAGO -- Just over a year after the Chicago Board of
Trade, suspecting an attempt to corner the market, ordered
large traders to liquidate positions in soybean futures
contracts, rumors about a possible similar attempt are
circulating in the soybean oil futures pit.
   ADM Investor Services, the futures trading division of the
huge grain processing firm Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., has
amassed a large position in soybean oil futures contracts,
traders said. The firm also is thought to hold more than half
of all receipts for delivery of soybean oil based on July and
August futures contracts, which show ownership of the oil
stored in warehouses.

   The price of the soybean oil futures contract for August
delivery settled at 24.36 cents a pound yesterday, up 0.11
cent.
   Talk on the floor of the Chicago exchange yesterday was
that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Board of
Trade's business conduct committee are investigating whether
ADM has a legitimate business reason for its holdings. A
spokeswoman for Archer-Daniels-Midland in Decatur, Ill.,
declined to comment. A Board of Trade spokesman also had no
comment.
   "Something's going on," said one prominent Board of Trade
member who asked not to be identified. "I'm sure it's in the
hands of the business conduct committee, and they're very
secretive about what they do."
   The CFTC routinely monitors firms with large positions in
any futures contracts as the contracts near expiration. It
was doing just that in July 1989, when Ferruzzi Finanziaria
S.p.A. came close to cornering the market in U.S. soybeans.
At the time, Ferruzzi owned contracts for 23 million bushels
of soybeans, but there were only 12 million bushels available
for convenient delivery.
   If Ferruzzi had tried to take delivery of all the soybeans
for which it had contracts, prices would have risen sharply
and some traders might have been forced to default on their
commitments to deliver the grain. The CFTC ordered Ferruzzi
to reduce its holdings by 20 million bushels, and the Board
of Trade followed suit by laying out a schedule under which
large traders had to liquidate their positions.
   Theoretically, controlling a majority of all available
soybean oil would give ADM similar influence over the price
of soybean oil futures contracts. But it's unclear what, if
any, steps the CFTC or Board of Trade has taken to curb the
company's control.
   Some traders speculated yesterday that the U.S. will
extend additional credit to the Soviet Union this fall to buy
grain, as soon as the country clears up emigration
restrictions on Soviet Jews. "That would make ADM's position
worth a whole lot of money," one analyst said.
   Others worry that ADM has no economic reason to hold its
warehouse receipts for soybean oil and may be attempting to
corner the market. Other grain-processing and trading firms
have complained to the Board of Trade and the CFTC about
ADM's holdings.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices edged higher, while
those of silver and platinum fell. December delivery gold
ended with a gain of 50 cents an ounce at $418.80 after
trading in a range of more than $5, from $414.80 to $420.10.
December silver slipped five cents an ounce to $5.2620, and
October platinum declined $3.30 an ounce to $504.10. Gold
traders concentrated on oil's inflationary potential,
ignoring the dollar's strength against European currencies.
As a result, gold fluctuated "tick for tick" with oil, said
William O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch.
It became known over the weekend that the Soviet Union sold
an estimated 75 tons, or about 2.4 million ounces, of gold
last week, according to Mr. O'Neill. "This may account for
some of the sluggishness in the market last week, when it
seemed that a firmer tone was warranted by the tense Middle
Eastern situation," he said. On the other hand, the market
showed an ability to absorb a large quantity of producer
selling and not break as it did when big Saudi Arabian sales
hit the market a few months ago, he said. About the only
negative factor in precious metals, the analyst said, is that
silver and platinum are experiencing little if any demand for
bullion. Platinum also has failed to react to tribal fighting
and tensions in South Africa, the world's leading producer,
he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices eased. October delivery sugar was
off 0.12 cent a pound at 11.28 cents. It traded as high as
11.41 cents before encountering selling, primarily
profit-taking from recent advances, one analyst said. She
said that China again was reported to be buying sugar in the
world market, but once this buying was out of the way no
other large orders were in prospect. China bought an
estimated 40,000 tons of sugar, bringing its purchases in
recent weeks to between 250,000 and 300,000 tons, the analyst
said. Another analyst said that although sugar futures
rebounded recently from a sharp drop, there still isn't any
fundamental reason for concern over supplies. In fact, this
analyst said, indications are that output will jump in the
1990-91 season that will begin Sept. 1.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices rose. The October delivery was up
1.09 cents a pound to 71.73 cents, and December cotton
advanced 0.89 cent to 70.10 cents. The October contract found
support that enabled it to rebound and offset last week's
declines, which were due to recession concerns related to the
Middle East crisis, analyst Thomas Mueller of Merrill Lynch
said. The recovery began late last week as the market
divorced itself from the Mideast situation and stock market
weakness, he said. Over the weekend, strong Far Eastern
demand developed for cotton in the cash market, which helped
boost prices, the analyst said. Separately, Louisiana, the
third largest cotton-producing state in the Mississippi
Delta, may not produce as much cotton as expected, according
to Mr. Mueller. The tops of the cotton plants are suffering
from prolonged dry weather in the state, he said. As a
result, Louisiana may produce about 1.1 million bales during
the 1990-91 season that began Aug. 1, or about 100,000 fewer
than expected earlier, Mr. Mueller said. Louisiana, unlike
Mississippi, hasn't had any significant rainfall in about a
month, he said.
