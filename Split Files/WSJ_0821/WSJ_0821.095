   Frederick "Fritz" Bensusan, a 28-year-old credit manager
in Santa Cruz, Calif., approves completely of President
Bush's handling of the Middle East crisis. "I think he has
done everything right," he says.
   But Mr. Bensusan is convinced that before it's over, there
will be loss of life. "We'll see some kind of military
action" soon, he believes, because "violence is a pattern for
the area." And he worries that here at home, the crisis will
provoke a recession.

   Mr. Bensusan's comments mirror the opinions and emotions
of American voters sampled in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll. The scientific telephone poll was supplemented by
face-to-face interviews, which show that Americans' support
for President Bush is stalwart -- and their pessimism about
quick success in the operation deep-seated.
   Overwhelmingly -- by 72% to 16% -- Americans continue to
back Mr. Bush's handling of the confrontation in the Middle
East, almost three weeks after Iraq's lightning seizure of
oil-rich Kuwait. By almost the same margin, they approve of
his decision to send military forces to Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf. And more than two-thirds of them say they are
willing to see those Americans fight under any of the most
likely scenarios.
   At the same time, these voters entertain no notions that
any of this is going to be easy. They believe that the U.S.
holds the upper hand so far. But a plurality, 42% of them,
believe the U.S. will end up in a war with Iraq.
   And in a rapid shift unusual in polling history, Americans
now conclude, 57% to 26%, that there will be a recession in
the U.S. sometime during the next 12 months. Only a month
ago, Americans believed by a lopsided 49% to 25% that there
wouldn't be one. This extraordinary turnaround, occurring at
a time of surging gasoline prices, is clearly a result of the
unfolding events in the Middle East.
   "So far, the public is pretty much of one mind. They've
concluded we've done the right thing and they back the
president by a large margin," say Peter Hart and Robert
Teeter, who conducted the poll for the Journal and NBC.
   Besides backing the general Bush approach, Americans
appear willing to commit U.S. forces to battle, particularly
if U.S. security or American hostages are at stake. If Iraq
were to invade Saudi Arabia, 74% of the poll's respondents
would support military action. Nearly as many would support a
combat role for American forces if Iraq imprisons or
mistreats Americans living in Kuwait. And 61% say they would
support an invasion of Iraq itself to try to force the
release of the hostages.
   The pollsters say they rarely have seen a survey where the
American public supported committing military forces to
battle before the fighting had actually begun. "If there is a
short message being sent to Iraq's Saddam Hussein," the
pollsters say, "it reads: `Don't mess with us.'"
   Thus, President Hussein's efforts to divide American
public opinion clearly aren't working; this poll was
conducted 2 1/2 weeks after the crisis began Aug. 2, meaning
that unlike earlier surveys, this one permitted respondents a
chance to think things through. "This is a reflective opinion
vs. the earlier reflexive opinions," say Mr. Hart, a
Democratic pollster, and Mr. Teeter, a Republican.
   But Americans are less inclined to go to war with Iraq
over economic questions, even over matters so critical as
Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti oil. If the price of gasoline
should surge to $2 a gallon, only 27% say the American
response should be military action.
   "That's not worth fighting for," says Linda Nidetz, a
34-year-old part-time legal secretary from Glenview, Ill.
"We've had gas shortages before."
   "The American voters are being very discriminating," the
two pollsters agree.
   Normally, Americans pull together, at least initially,
when their troops are committed to dangerous missions abroad.
President Reagan scored high marks for intervening in Grenada
and Mr. Bush for ousting Panama's Manuel Noriega.
   But those patriotic surges can sour if the news from the
battlefield is bad, or if the conflict shows no signs of
coming to a successful conclusion. Vietnam, of course, is the
most searing example, one that continues to burn in the minds
of Americans. "After Vietnam, I can't think of hardly
anything that's worth starting a war over," says Annette
Burt, a 40-year-old airline employee from Linden, N.J.
   But a more apt comparison may be President Truman's
intervention in 1950 to prevent South Korea from being
overrun by North Korea's powerful army.
   The American army then fought under a United Nations flag,
with U.S. Allies giving the effort limited support.
Initially, according to historical Gallup poll data,
Americans supported defending South Korea by 65% to 20% --
not so different from their current feelings about Kuwait.
But as the North Koreans overran the Allied troops, sentiment
changed. In just four months, between September 1950 and
January 1951, opinion turned around even as the news was
getting better -- until half of the American public concluded
it had been a mistake after all. Dwight Eisenhower was
elected president in 1952 on his implied promise to end the
Korean fighting.
   So far, the President's strategy of Middle East
intervention wins the support of a broad range of Americans
-- men and women, older and younger, Democratic and
Republican. Pollsters Teeter and Hart note that 62% of the
women responding support sending troops to the Middle East
(and 68% support the president's handling of the crisis).
   The one exception is blacks. Only 41% (against 74% for
white voters) approve of sending combat forces to the Middle
East.
   Priorities also are a concern to Delia Realmo, a
high-school history teacher in Chicago's predominantly
Mexican-American Little Village neighborhood. "We have a
health-care crisis, a measles epidemic and things the rest of
the country doesn't even think about," she says, expressing
reservations about the use of force in the Middle East.
   Americans who support Mr. Bush rarely express doubts about
the mission itself. Nancy Calhoun, a 46-year-old town
supervisor in Blooming Grove, N.Y., notes that she has a son
serving as a Navy pilot. "That's why my son is there {in the
Navy}; it is a stand for democracy and a stand for the
world," she says.
   "I'd throw the H-bomb at them," says Jerome Cummisky, a
79-year-old retired real estate and insurance agent from
Madison Lake, Minn.
   But there is an undercurrent, both in the poll and in the
interviews, that this operation won't be an easy one to
conclude successfully. While approving the concept, people
wonder about the execution.
   "I think the worst is perhaps ahead of us," says Gary
Patton, a 46-year-old lawyer in Santa Cruz.
   "It's really a scary, scary situation," says Pamela
Jenkins, 35, an office supervisor at Burnside Coal &amp; Oil in
the Bronx borough of New York City. "I think a guy who used
chemical warfare on his own people just doesn't value human
life, and that may get us into terrible trouble."
   "I think it's going to escalate to an armed conflict,"
says Robert O'Leary, a 36-year-old insurance salesman from
Walden, N.Y. "Our hostages are history."
   In the poll, Americans are almost evenly divided on
whether they think the crisis will lead to combat, 42% saying
it will and 40% expecting the U.S. to achieve its objectives
short of war.
   By the same token, people are somewhat doubtful that
economic sanctions and a blockade will enable the U.S. to
achieve its objectives, with 43% saying those actions will
work and 37% saying they won't.
   They tend to support some options a lot more heavily than
others. Calling up National Guard and Reserve units wins
broad approval, with more than three-quarters in support.
Blockading Jordan, if it doesn't go along with economic
sanctions, is popular too, with 59% in support.
   What happens to American hostages clearly will be a major
factor in framing public opinion. Americans feel so strongly
about this that 61% say they would support invading Iraq --
an immense military challenge -- to force Saddam Hussein to
free Americans.
   But while an overwhelming majority would agree to an
invasion of Iraq for this purpose, a much smaller majority
supports the idea of cutting off food to Iraq to the point
that innocent civilians would go hungry. Black voters, again,
part company, with only 37% supporting the idea of shutting
down food supplies to Iraq, compared with 58% of whites in
support.
   Americans worry about the hostages abroad; at home, they
worry about a recession.
   Pollsters Teeter and Hart say they are stunned by the
turnaround in economic opinion, with 57% of Americans now
believing there will be a recession in the next 12 months.
   "The economy's been teetering on the edge for some time,
and this crisis will probably put the economy over the edge,"
says Jim Lufty, who owns a card shop in Traverse City, Mich.
   Pessimism about the economy is widely distributed.
Pollsters find that black voters tend to be more pessimistic
about the direction the economy is going than white voters,
but in this poll white voters are just as pessimistic.
   And when it comes to assigning blame for the surge in
gasoline prices, there is little doubt in these people's
minds. U.S. oil companies are blamed by 70% of the
respondents -- and Saddam Hussein by only 13%.
