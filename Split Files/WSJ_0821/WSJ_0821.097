   NEVADA POWER Co. (Las Vegas, Nev.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on about $260
million of this utility's debt. The rating concern said
Nevada Power probably will have to borrow heavily over the
next five years to fund a major expansion program, and it
cited the utility's recent rate decreases. Moody's downgraded
its ratings on Nevada Power's first-mortgage bonds and
secured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-2,
unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-2 from single-A-3,
and commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1. Richard Hyte,
Nevada Power's chief financial officer, said the utility's
explosive customer growth is straining its cash flow.
"Funding for heavy construction requirements and increasing
customer service costs will need to come, in part, from
future rate increases," he said. Nevada Power said its
capital outlays increased to $120 million last year from $50
million three years ago. It said its capital budget probably
will increase 38% this year, and will average $200 million
for each of the next three years.
