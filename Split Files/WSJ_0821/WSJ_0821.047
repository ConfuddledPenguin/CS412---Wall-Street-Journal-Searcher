   LANCASTER, Pa. -- In October 1988, one of the world's most
successful corporate raiders and greenmailers set its sights
on a sleepy maker of floor coverings located here among the
peaceful Pennsylvania Dutch. For the Belzbergs, Armstrong
World Industries Inc. looked like mighty easy prey.
   The Belzbergs were, after all, the Canadian financiers who
had over the past decade made more than $250 million buying
stakes in more than a dozen companies and threatening to take
them over. The fearful target then generally offered the
family a big premium, or greenmail, to go away, or found
another bidder to buy the Belzbergs out.

   Family chief Samuel Belzberg, 62, is such a tough operator
that he mounted a successful takeover of Scovill Inc. the
week before Christmas in 1984, and the next year threatened
Arvin Industries Inc. with a takeover bid on Christmas Eve
itself.
   The Belzbergs were investors both in Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co.,
headed by the legendary arbitrager and inside trader, and in
Jamie Securities Co., run by recently convicted securities
felon John Mulheren, at whose trial Sam testified as a
character witness.
   Sam's son Marc, increasingly the family's lead player in
the takeover game, was found by a federal court in Washington
to have illegally concealed the family's ownership of Ashland
Oil Co. shares during a takeover fight for that company in
1986. A Belzberg unit paid $3.1 million to settle this civil
suit and a related case.
   Marc once expressed his business philosophy to a seminar
at his alma mater, Yeshiva University, according to a friend
who attended: "In your personal life, you meet someone and
give them the benefit of the doubt, bring them to your house,
serve them a meal; if you do that in the business world,
you'll get robbed." Mr. Belzberg says he doesn't remember the
talk.
   It was with a similar spirit of good will that the
Belzbergs went after Armstrong with a public takeover
proposal in July of 1989. In May of this year, the 10-month
battle ended and the Belzbergs, true to form, sold their
shares. But this time, no greenmail was paid: The Belzbergs
lost about $13.6 million.
   The story of how one of the last of the greenmailers went
down to defeat says a lot about the business conditions with
which the '90s have begun. Without enough equity behind them
and with junk bonds no longer considered a proper or readily
available substitute, the Belzbergs were nothing more than a
paper tiger against the then $2.3 billion Armstrong, a
company the Belzbergs would have easily been able to gobble
up or greenmail just two years earlier. What's more, their
once-successful relationship with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
and their history as greenmailers weakened the Belzberg's
reputation with the rest of Wall Street, as well as with the
shareholders and legislators who came to Armstrong's defense.
   The Belzbergs, who include Sam's brothers Hyman, 66, and
William, 58, and who have a combined estimated net worth of
$400 million, seem to have learned a lesson from the
experience. Although none of the Belzbergs would be
interviewed for this article, Sam Belzberg acknowledged in an
April interview with this newspaper: "Business is a little
bit tough right now." Adds Gordon Lancaster, executive vice
president of the Belzbergs' main holding company, First City
Financial Co., "The hostile, high-profile, newsworthy,
headline-making transaction is gone. Sam says the new First
City will be really boring."
   The Belzbergs, who first made their money in furniture,
real estate investing and oil and gas leases, may come to
relish boredom, as right now, the Armstrong failure isn't the
only problem in their far-flung empire.
   Far West Financial Corp., a Los Angeles-based savings and
loan that is 54.2%-owned by the Belzbergs, needs at least
$130 million of new capital to prevent a federal takeover,
which seems more likely since regulators rejected a
recapitalization plan last week. Far West was a major
purchaser of junk bonds, which have dragged its net worth
down perilously close to insolvency. As with many other big
clients, Drexel Burnham's Michael Milken not only sold the
Belzberg empire junk bonds, but he also raised money from
junk sales to others to finance the family's raiding
operations. "Far West is a typical Drexel-Milken daisy chain
thrift," says Kenneth Thomas, a Miami-based thrift analyst.
   First City, the family's Vancouver-based flagship, also
has problems. In recent years, gains on securities trading
and investments generated the largest part share of its
earnings.
   Such gains will probably be slimmer in the post-takeover
era. First City plans to close its New York arbitrage
operation, which invests in takeover stocks; an associate
cites losses on UAL Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp. First City
also blamed "volatile markets" and losses on arbitrage for a
sharp drop in first-quarter earnings. The results followed a
20.7 million Canadian dollar loss for the fourth quarter of
1989, owing to loss provisions on unspecified investments.
   First City's 5.6% stake in Britain's Asda Group PLC, a big
retailer, is now worth roughly $44 million less than what the
Belzbergs paid for it, according to a Toronto analyst's
estimate.
   And recently, Sam Belzberg sold First City's nine-seat
Challenger jet plane for about $7 million in a cost-cutting
move.
   When the Belzbergs first began making secret purchases of
Armstrong shares in late 1988, the target clearly looked ripe
for the picking. The home-products market was going through a
big period of consolidation, and Armstrong had strong market
share and good earnings, and was affordable. "We were on
everybody's takeover screens," says the company's soft-spoken
chairman, William Adams.
   In some ways, however, the Belzbergs' effort seemed
ill-fated from the start. Shortly after they began acquiring
Armstrong shares, their investment bank, Drexel, agreed to
plead guilty to six federal felony charges. In March of 1989,
when the Belzbergs owned 4% of Armstrong, their financier,
Mr. Milken, was indicted on racketeering and various
securities-law violations. As Drexel began sputtering toward
its eventual bankruptcy-law filing earlier this year, market
professionals suspected that the Belzbergs were losing much
of their effectiveness.
   "They were nothing more than spearcarriers for Drexel,"
says Guy Wyser-Pratte, arbitrage chief at PrudentialBache
Securities, who believes the Belzbergs couldn't do a big deal
without Drexel's help.
   Soon, the Belzbergs' secret stock purchases soared above
$15 million in value, and the government had to be notified
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. The Belzbergs'
filing put the Armstrong camp on alert.
   Mr. Adams, 56, the thin and bespectacled Armstrong chief,
proved in many ways a sharp contrast to the ruddy-faced,
stocky Belzberg family boss. Sam Belzberg is an art collector
and inveterate international traveler, a competitive
sportsman and a big fan of professional boxing.
   Mr. Adams is a lifelong Armstrong employee who is so
punctilious he records his hole-by-hole golf scores on his
home computer.
   But unlike those who had quickly capitulated under a
Belzberg merger offer, Mr. Adams quickly dismissed the idea.
The Belzbergs proposed a merger in July of 1989, announcing
that they had amassed a menacing 9.85% of Armstrong's shares.
Armstrong did offer to buy back the Belzbergs' stake, but
only at the current market price, with no premium. The
Belzbergs, in a declaration of war, refused.
   By last fall, the junk-bond market and Drexel Burnham were
reeling, so the Belzbergs searched Wall Street for other
sources of cash to finance a takeover battle. Numerous
investment and commercial banks declined to help, a former
First City executive says. First City's Mr. Lancaster says
financing commitments were lined up at one point in the
summer of 1989, but they lapsed.
   And then Armstrong struck back. Already protected with
plenty of anti-takeover armor, the company went further: It
put 10% of its stock in the hands of a new employee stock
ownership plan. It also sought from the Pennsylvania
legislature the toughest anti-takeover bill in the country --
and saw it ceremoniously signed into law in Lancaster three
days before Armstrong's annual meeting in April.
   Under that law, a raider selling his stake in a
Pennsylvania company within 18 months of making a bid to
control it has to turn over any profits from the deal to the
company he was raiding. The law also specifically allows a
target company's directors to reject a takeover bid even if
the bid seems in the best interest of the target company's
shareholders, as long as the directors believe other
"stakeholders," such as the employees, would be hurt.
   For the Belzbergs, the Pennsylvania takeover law packed a
double wallop: Not only did it make a hostile bid for
Armstrong more difficult, but the controversy surrounding the
law helped stall the company's stock price, making it
impossible for the Belzbergs to sell their Armstrong shares
at a profit. "Whatever takeover premium that might have
existed a year ago was beaten out by the mere proposal" of
the law, complains an adviser to the Belzbergs.
   With the costs of maintaining their more than $170 million
stake mounting -- they borrowed money to buy some of the
shares -- the Belzbergs had time for one final maneuver: They
would go right to the Armstrong shareholders, seeking to
unseat four of the 13 directors. The proxy fight, if
successful, would pave the way for a Belzberg takeover of
Armstrong.
   But here the Belzbergs' reputation caught up to them. Some
of the large institutional investors that controlled 60% of
Armstrong remembered all too well how the Belzbergs had cost
them money before, by accepting greenmail. In such cases, the
Belzbergs made a big profit by selling their shares in a
particular company, but the sudden removal of the Belzberg
takeover threat usually caused the target company's shares to
plunge in value.
   "Greenmail, of course, is anathema to us," says Jim
Ullman, a portfolio strategist at Batterymarch Financial
Management, which owned about 1 million Armstrong shares at
the time of the proxy fight. Batterymarch says it was burned
in the Belzbergs' greenmail play at Ashland. "Greenmail, on
the face of it, is inequitable. It almost amounts to
stealing," Mr. Ullman says.
   Sam Belzberg said in the April interview that "I don't
know what greenmail is." But he added that the family no
longer accepts a buy-out of its investment shares at a
premium not available to other shareholders.
   The Belzbergs did get some expressions of sympathy from
some big holders who disliked the Pennsylvania anti-takeover
law, but it wasn't nearly enough.
   Armstrong's management, meanwhile, had done a decent job
with the company, given the industry's cyclical nature.
First-quarter results were particularly encouraging. Profits
from continuing operations, excluding unusual items, rose 30%
to $40.7 million or 86 cents a share.
   At the April 30 shareholder vote, the Belzbergs won enough
ballots to seat only Michael Jensen, a professor of business
administration at Harvard who is widely seen as a
shareholder-rights champion.
   A chastened Sam Belzberg decided to bail out. On May 30,
the family sold its entire stake, three-quarters of it to
Armstrong, for about $171.5 million, about $18 million less
than the family paid for it. Though settlements of
outstanding lawsuits with Armstrong later won the Belzbergs
another $4.4 million, they had lost the long battle, and
ended, at least for the foreseeable future, their days as a
raider.
   The Belzbergs say they are shifting their focus to West
Coast real estate and environmental services as two potential
growth areas.
   Mr. Lancaster says First City also is now busy chasing
friendly but smaller deals, often involving assets that
debt-ridden companies need to unload. But he acknowledges
that First City isn't likely to be able to sustain the
profits it reaped from its '80s-style raids. And Sam Belzberg
is no longer talking of building a giant industrial empire.
   Instead, one of his current passions involves a big
underground reservoir in the Colorado desert, where he and
his partners have acquired a large chunk of land. They hope
to tap the reservoir to sell water to Denver residents.
   But once again, opponents are lining up against the
Belzbergs: Ranchers are worried about their wells going dry,
and a group of self-styled New Age mystics that live in the
area are also opposed. Says Belzberg aide Mr. Lancaster,
"Every environmentalist, every Indian band, every Tom, Dick,
and Harry is going to be involved in this."
