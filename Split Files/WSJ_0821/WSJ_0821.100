   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. boosted anticipated outlays for the
first-stage construction of its planned Lilly Technology
Center in Indianapolis, to $540 million from about $185
million.
   The pharmaceutical giant said the technology center will
house current production and distribution operations, and
bring together labs and related activities involved in
developing production processes for new pharmaceutical
products.

   Under the plan, Lilly will build a $120 million
biotechnology development laboratory, and will spend $145
million on other projects by 1994, in addition to $90 million
for infrastructure work.
   Also to be included at the center are a previously
announced $150 million facility for producing the company's
synthetic human insulin product, and a $35 million
administrative building.
   A Lilly spokesman said the second phase of the project,
set for the latter half of the decade, will boost the
expenditures to more than $1 billion.
   The technology center is separate from Lilly's cross-town
headquarters and basic-research labs, where a previously
announced $415 million expansion project is also under way.
