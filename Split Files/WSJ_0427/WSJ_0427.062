   LONDON -- World cocoa production will fall this season for
the first time in six years, but should still be well in
excess of consumption, the International Cocoa Organization
predicted.
   The London-based organization of cocoa producers and
consumers forecast 1989-90 (October-September) world
production of 2.37 million metric tons, compared with last
season's record 2.42 million.

   Cocoa consumption, which has been stimulated by low prices
in the past 12 months, will grow 5.7% to a record 2.2 million
tons, it said. This would still be 154,000 tons below
production.
   In 1988-89, cocoa production exceeded consumption by a
record 321,000 tons, lifting end-of-season stocks to a record
high of 1.24 million, the organization said.
   Five seasons of overproduction, and a projected sixth in
1989-90, knocked cocoa prices to a 14-year low earlier this
year.
