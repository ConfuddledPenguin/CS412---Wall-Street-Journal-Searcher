   The Menlo Park, Calif., maker of aerospace, automotive,
electronics and telecommunications products attributed the
decline to the electronics sector. Those operations
experienced price erosion, product shifts from defense to
commercial markets, high unit costs in U.S. factories and
costs of making newer commercial products.
   As a result of the company's changing business and product
mix, it said an $8 million provision for inventory
obsolescence was included in the cost of products sold in the
quarter. It said the obsolescence provision was $4 million a
year ago.
   In the first nine months, the company had a loss of $97.8
million, or $2.75 a share, compared with net of $23.4
million, or 67 cents, a year earlier. Sales climbed nearly 5%
to $819.7 million.
