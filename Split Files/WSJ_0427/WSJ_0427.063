   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp.'s first-quarter profit fell
50% to $44 million, or 56 cents a primary share, as the
company continued to feel the effects of a weakened New
England economy.
   In the year-ago quarter, the bank holding company had
profit of $89 million, or $1.23 a primary share.

   The latest quarter included a provision for credit losses
of $125 million, compared with $36 million in the 1989 first
quarter. That increase was partly offset by a pretax gain of
$33 million on the settlement of a portion of the company's
pension obligations.
   Nonperforming assets jumped to $1.98 billion, or about 8%
of related asset categories, from $1.69 billion, or 6.6% of
related assets at Dec. 31. At March 31, 1989, problem assets
totaled $1.3 billion, or 4.9% of related assets.
   "Credit quality remains a primary focus of Bank of Boston,
and given the uncertainty in the economy, we are continuing
to monitor our portfolio very closely," Ira Stepanian,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   The $291 million increase in nonperforming assets since
Dec. 31 came largely from a $177 million rise in troubled
commercial real estate loans and another $75 million in
foreclosed real estate.
   In another sensitive category, nonperforming assets in the
company's large portfolio of financings for highly leveraged
transactions edged up to $236 million from $222 million.
Peter Manning, chief financial officer, said those figures
reflect completion of a recent regulatory examination that
focused on highly leveraged transactions in which Bank of
Boston is the sole creditor. Examiners later this year are
expected to go over shared transactions at the lead banks,
including Bank of Boston, Mr. Manning said.
   Mr. Manning noted that Bank of Boston reduced its
portfolio of highly leveraged transaction financings to $4.8
billion at March 31 from $5.3 billion at Dec. 31.
   Net interest revenue dropped to $311 million from the
year-earlier $322 million, while the interest margin fell to
3.71% from 4.13%. Higher international margins, mainly in
Latin America, partly offset the effects of increased
nonperforming assets and higher rates paid to attract
long-term deposits, the company said.
   Noninterest income, meanwhile, rose to $212 million from
the year-ago $161 million. In addition to the pension-related
gain, the company had a $29 million increase in profits from
mezzanine financing and its venture-capital portfolio.
   Carole Berger, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, said,
"There's nothing in {the earnings announcement} that would
make me feel a lot better about the underlying earnings," of
the company. Ms. Berger said she continues to believe the
company may be forced to cut its dividend in future quarters,
and thinks the stock price may decline further.
   Bank of Boston confirmed that it will pay today a
quarterly dividend of 31 cents a share.
