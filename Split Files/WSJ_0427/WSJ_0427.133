   Prices of soybean futures contracts soared for the second
consecutive day yesterday amid signs of problems with the
crucial Brazilian harvest, which is about half complete.
   Some U.S. crop analysts have cut by 5% their projections
of the Brazilian harvest, which has been slowed by rainfall.
At the same time, the confusion caused by the Brazilian
government's stiff anti-inflation program appears to be
disrupting that country's exports.

   Brazil and the U.S. are the two largest exporters of
soybeans. Brazil supplies much of the world's needs this time
of year. U.S. exports pick up after its harvest in September
and October.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the
soybean contract for July delivery jumped 16.25 cents a
bushel to settle at $6.425 a bushel.
   The problems in Brazil come at a time when demand is
growing in Europe and the U.S. for soybeans and soybean meal.
European demand for soybean meal as an ingredient in
livestock feed is strong partly because it is cheaper than
corn. In the U.S., cattle and poultry numbers are increasing.
   "The important fact is that world demand for meal and
beans is excellent," said Mickey J. Luth, an analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago. "The sales and harvest in
South America are too slow to allow that demand to be met."
   The anti-inflation program by the Brazilian government
"has muddied the waters" for farmers there, Mr. Luth said. In
short, growers are holding onto their crops because they are
confused about how the program will affect prices and
currency exchange rates. That, in turn, is crimping the
supply of soybeans available for processing and export.
   One sign of a tightening of export supplies is the hectic
trading at Rotterdam, the port that handles much of the crops
shipped into northern Europe. According to analysts,
importers there are scrambling to find soybean meal because
of concerns that shipments from Brazil will be delayed.
   Some analysts also are trimming the size of the harvest in
Brazil.
   Mario Balletto, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York,
said that delays in the harvest because of rainy weather are
increasing the chances that production could slip to about 19
million metric tons.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Agriculture Department cut
its estimate of the Brazilian soybean harvest to 20 million
metric tons from the 20.5 million metric tons it forecast in
March.
   The rally Wednesday was partly fueled by rumors that the
Soviet Union was interested in buying up to 400,000 metric
tons of U.S. soybean meal. The Soviet-related rumors
continued to circulate yesterday.
   The perception, at least, of a tight supply of soybeans
for export from Brazil is making U.S. traders increasingly
jittery about planting conditions in the U.S.
   Although soil in the Midwest is generally in the best
condition of the last two years, a recent spate of
unseasonably warm weather also contributed to the price rise
yesterday by fanning speculation about dry weather. However,
only a fraction of U.S. farmers have begun planting soybeans.
   Prices of corn futures contracts rose slightly. Prices of
most wheat futures contracts also edged higher.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices traded in a narrow range
and ended mixed, as the market turned quiet following
Wednesday's spurt of selling. July delivery platinum, which
led the decline Wednesday, recovered slightly yesterday to
end with a gain of $1.70 an ounce to $473.90. One analyst,
however, observed that the advance wasn't very impressive
following Wednesday's plunge of $22.50 at one point and a
closing loss of $16.60. June delivery gold was off 30 cents
an ounce to $373.30 and May silver was lower by 0.08 cent an
ounce at $4.9140. The trading atmosphere was far less
frenetic than on Wednesday, and the absence of further
selling by producers kept prices from falling sharply again,
the analyst said. Some light demand for platinum bullion
developed from Japan, the analyst said, but there was little
buying interest for gold and silver bullion. Technically, the
analyst noted, Wednesday's heavy trading in precious metals
resulted in what could be a price-depressing factor. Open
interest, or the number of outstanding contracts that must be
nullified by an opposite trade of delivery of a commodity,
rose in all three metals, which indicates a significant
number of new short sellers, or traders who sold contracts
expecting prices to decline. According to another analyst,
John Norris, director of precious metals trading at Citibank,
New York, not only was there a lack of follow-through selling
but also demand was lacking. "And where some demand did
appear, it died out quickly," he said. A further increase in
interest rates, as bond prices fell again, also damped buying
interest in precious metals, Mr. Norris noted.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Liquidation of the April contract, which ceased
trading at the close yesterday, was "orderly," according to
Commodity Exchange spokesman Robert McGrath. The contract
ended trading at $1.35 a pound, up one cent from Wednesday.
Earlier in the day, there were indications that the gap
between available exchange supplies of copper and the number
of April contracts that remained to be satisfied continued to
narrow, leaving a smaller number of contracts to be
liquidated during trading. As the session began, the number
of outstanding contracts dropped by 279 to 557, which is the
equivalent of 6,962 tons, while deliverable exchange
inventories of copper rose 1,975 tons to 6,004 tons. Later in
the day, the exchange revised inventories upward by 615 tons
to 6,619 tons. While the April contract expired without
difficulties, as is usually the case when there is a
disparity between deliverable supplies and outstanding
contracts, the concern about deliveries this time continued
right into the last day. April expired at a 15-cents-a-pound
premium over the May contract, which was unchanged from
Wednesday at $1.20 a pound. The premium reflects a continuing
tightness of immediately available supplies, according to one
analyst, who said: "Let's see what the copper market is going
to do now without the upward pressure of the April contract."
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: World oil prices were mixed but generally lower in
listless trading. Oil analysts said there was little news to
affect the markets. Traders, meanwhile, appeared to be
sitting on the sidelines until after next week's meeting of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was
called to try to shore up sagging oil prices. In U.S. futures
trading, West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery
dropped 19 cents a barrel to settle at $18.47. The July crude
contract was down nine cents to $19.08. The crude declines
further weakened gasoline futures, which had already turned
soft earlier in the week. Unleaded gasoline for May delivery
fell 1.26 cents a gallon to settle at 61.34 cents on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. June gasoline was off 0.92 cent to
60.5 cents. Heating oil showed strength, however, at least in
the May and June contracts. May was up 0.67 cent a gallon to
53.07 cents while the June contract rose 0.1 cent to 50.61
cents.
