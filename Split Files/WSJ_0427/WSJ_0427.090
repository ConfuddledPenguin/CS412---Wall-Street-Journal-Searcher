   TOKYO -- The Bush administration's apparent decision to
refrain from again branding Japan as an unfair trading
partner stems a year-long erosion in relations between the
two countries.
   But while some government officials here are proclaiming a
thaw in the trade war, many observers fear this is only a
temporary lull, with contentious issues looming a few months
away.

   "The immediate problems seem now to have been sorted out,"
Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said at a
news conference. But, he added, "we've got a lot of follow-up
work to do."
   The Bush administration continued to play its cards close
to the chest yesterday. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the president still hasn't decided whether to
name Japan as an unfair trader under the so-called Super 301
clause of the 1988 Trade Act. But Mr. Fitzwater did praise
Trade Representative Carla Hills's congressional testimony
Wednesday, in which she indicated the U.S. wouldn't name
Japan for a second year.
   The president's Economic Policy Council met yesterday, and
administration officials said it was clear from the meeting
that Japan wouldn't be cited as an unfair trader. The council
will relay its findings to Mr. Bush in time for him to make a
decision by Monday, Mr. Fitzwater said. The administration
officials said the decision could come as early as today.
   But with the writing already on the wall, there was a sigh
of relief in Tokyo this week, in sharp contrast to the bitter
outpouring a year ago when the U.S. used the Super 301
provisions to cite Japan for protecting three domestic
industries.
   "One cannot but be impressed by the change and how far we
have come," said a senior Foreign Ministry official.
   But there have been periods of premature euphoria before.
In 1988, after Japan agreed to open its beef, citrus and
construction markets, U.S. officials said publicly that there
were no trade disputes outstanding between the two countries.
   The U.S. and Japan still face discussions this year on
construction, intellectual property, telecommunications
equipment and on Allied-Signal Inc.'s ability to sell a new
kind of metal product in Japan. In mid-1991, the five-year
U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement expires, and the American
industry remains disappointed with its access to the Japanese
market.
   "Although the sophisticated way of handling things is not
to name Japan {under Super 301}, the fact remains that all
these issues will be taken up anyway between the countries,"
noted Hajime Ohta, director of international economic affairs
for Keidanren, a business organization.
   Still, America's trade deficit with Japan, a subject of
heated political debate in the U.S., is likely to widen later
this year if the yen remains weak, making U.S. exports to
Japan more expensive and Japanese imports to the U.S. less
so.
   But Japanese officials hope the recent events augur a
basic change in the traditional trade relationship, under
which the U.S. pressures Japan, which then caves in at the
last minute under threat of sanctions. This year they settled
negotiations on satellites, supercomputers and wood products
as much as two months before the official deadline, the
Japanese said.
   Mr. Armacost, the U.S. ambassador, said at the news
conference that "we have a chance to work on them a little
more quietly." The atmosphere was anything but quiet when
Washington initially invoked the 1988 Trade Act. Japan said
that the Super 301 provisions were illegal and that it would
refuse to negotiate under them.
   But as the months dragged on, the anger went beyond the
specific trade issues to a deep fear that the U.S. had turned
hostile to Japan and that the overall relationship was
fraying. The showdown came in the past few weeks, with a
string of deadlines for U.S. retaliation.
   The U.S.-Japan trade talks had been going so poorly on
several fronts that President Bush invited Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu to an emergency summit meeting in
early March. Since then, Japan has hastened to tidy up more
than a half-dozen pending and potential trade battles and has
written a rough draft for a plan to make its economy more
open to imports.
   Japanese government officials, grown paranoid about the
level of anti-Japan rhetoric in Washington, say that for the
first time in months they feel "the atmosphere {there} has
changed in such a way that those people who like to stand up
and say positive things about Japan can do so," the Foreign
Ministry official said. "That wasn't the case two months
ago."
