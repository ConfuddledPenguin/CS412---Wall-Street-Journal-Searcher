   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The East German pharmaceutical
industry will receive protection from Western competition
until the end of 1992, the West German Federation of the
Pharmaceuticals Industry said.
   Under an agreement with the East German pharmaceutical
association, German companies will sell drugs only in the
country for which no comparable East German products are
available in that period. The supply of basic pharmaceutical
products will continue to be provided by East German
companies, the two groups agreed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That will give the East German industry a grace period to
adjust itself to Western productivity standards and raise the
skill level of its employees ahead of the scheduled
completion of a single internal market in the European
Community at the end of 1992.
   Over the next few years, West German drug companies will
help their East German counterparts to improve their
competitiveness and fulfill their obligations toward other
East European countries, the West German federation said.
