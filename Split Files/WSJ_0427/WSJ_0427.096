   WASHINGTON -- Several drug companies with
government-granted temporary monopolies to produce drugs for
rare diseases now face the chilling prospect of competition.
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) proposed yesterday to limit
the scope of the so-called orphan drug law, which bestowed
seven-year monopolies on drug companies to produce
medications for such unusual illnesses as dwarfism.

   The proposal reflects growing sentiment in government --
and in the biotechnology industry itself -- that too few drug
companies are allowed entry to the sometimes-lucrative
orphan-drug market. As a result, critics argue, a handful of
government-protected drug companies, including Genentech
Inc., Amgen Inc. and Lyphomed Inc., receive an unfair
advantage over potential competitors. That, in turn, enables
them to price their orphan drugs unnecessarily high, some
argue.
   But the Food and Drug Administration's orphan-drug program
demonstrates the benefits as well as the perils of granting
special federal privileges to individual companies.
Congress's creation of the orphan-drug designation in 1983
resulted in the approval of 42 drugs to treat a variety of
rare diseases. Many of these drugs wouldn't have been
sufficiently profitable to produce without the orphan-drug
law's guarantee of exclusivity.
   Now, Congress must decide whether the balance has shifted
too far from medical and consumer interests -- and too
closely to individual corporate interests. "The orphan-drug
act was not intended to be a way for drug companies to get a
large monopoly for a drug that had potential to create large
profits," says Mr. Waxman, who was an author of the original
1983 bill.
   Under Rep. Waxman's proposed new amendments, a drug
company would lose its monopoly on an orphan drug if another
company could demonstrate that it had developed the same drug
at the same time. Biotechnology firms that compete with
Genentech, Amgen and Lyphomed would probably benefit from
this provision.
   Genentech, for instance, produces a drug called human
growth hormone that is used to treat dwarfism. The drug is a
biotechnological version of a human hormone that was
previously marketed by a number of other companies that
extracted the hormone from human cadavers. But after this
method of producing the drug was found to spread disease,
several companies raced to create a synthetic version.
   "They were the first on the market, and I don't think
anybody disagrees that the first on the market deserves a
reward," says Thomas Wiggins, president of Serono
Laboratories Inc., which also tried to develop a
biotechnology version of human growth hormone. But "any time
you've got five companies simultaneously developing a
product, it's hardly an orphan."
   But David Beier, Genentech vice president, government
affairs, says the Waxman proposal is "a breach of contract
between the government and the people who have already
developed orphan drugs." Genentech last year had revenue of
$123 million from human growth hormone. Mr. Beier estimates
that the people who require the drug number just 10,000.
   Rep. Waxman's bill would also withdraw monopoly status if
the patient population for an orphan drug unexpectedly grew
beyond 200,000 after approval. Under current law, there is no
provision to withdraw orphan-drug status if an orphan drug's
market exceeds original estimates. Lyphomed, Rosemont, Ill.,
may be harmed by this provision because it makes an orphan
drug for AIDS-related pneumonia, Aerosol Pentamidine, whose
market is estimated to be approaching 200,000.
   Critics of current orphan-drug policy argue that with more
competition orphan-drug prices would be lower. But
Genentech's Mr. Beier points out that his company already
competes with Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which was granted orphan-drug
status for a version of human growth hormone that differs by
one amino acid.
   The issue of price is particularly contentious in the case
of EPO, an orphan drug manufactured by Amgen. The drug is
sold to kidney-dialysis patients, 80% of whose medical costs
are paid for by the federal government.
   "If the price is kept artificially high because
competition is prohibited," says Mr. Waxman, "taxpayers are
going to be paying a lot of money that could be used for
other worthwhile purposes." Amgen Chairman George Rathman
estimates that the federal government pays $200 million
annually for EPO.
   The issue of orphan-drug reform caused a recent split
within the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade
group. As a result of the group's failure to call for changes
in the law, two biotechnology firms, Cetus Corp. and Genetics
Institute Inc., resigned from the group.
   Dr. Rathman of Amgen declines to comment on the Waxman
proposal, which he says he hasn't seen. But he says any
company can market an alternative version of an orphan drug
provided it can come up with a new application for its use
for which it can receive an orphan designation.
   Lyphomed also declines to comment on the Waxman bill.
