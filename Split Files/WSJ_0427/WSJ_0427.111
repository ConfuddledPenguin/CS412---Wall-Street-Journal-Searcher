   Wang Laboratories Inc.'s revenue slump worsened in the
third quarter, ended March 31, and one-time charges caused a
"significant loss" for the quarter, Richard W. Miller,
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said.
   Mr. Miller said in an interview that by the end of June,
Wang expects to reduce employment to about 20,000, down from
22,000 now. About 1,500 of the reduction represents employees
at units that are being sold but the planned level is lower
than Wang had previously disclosed. A year ago, the Lowell,
Mass., concern had about 31,000 workers before it began
cutting.

   Mr. Miller had previously warned that the third-quarter
operating loss would be worse than analysts expected. The
one-time charges are mostly related to the sales of certain
operations to raise cash and reduce debt.
   Separately, Data General Corp., Westboro, Mass., another
minicomputer maker attempting a turnaround, reported a net
loss of $8.6 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with net
income of $7 million, or 23 cents a share, for its fiscal
second quarter, ended March 31. Revenue fell 8.2% to $314.8
million from $342.7 million.
   The two companies' results emphasize that the computer
industry isn't enjoying any universal upturn, despite the
better-than-expected results reported by International
Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. last
week.
   Mr. Miller of Wang said that revenue for the quarter was
down more than the 13% decline recorded during the first half
of the fiscal year. In the year-ago third quarter, Wang
reported a restated net loss of $63.7 million, or 39 cents a
share, on revenue of $721.4 million. Mr. Miller declined to
be specific about earnings, which Wang expects to report
today.
   He said that the results reflect the weakness of the
midrange computer industry, especially in the U.S. He said
European markets were about flat and some Asian markets were
up but Australia was down.
   The sales slump was worst in January and February when a
reorganization of corporate marketers to focus on customer
segments such as banks, lawyers and insurance companies
caused a "loss of momentum," he said. He added that "for
March and so far in April, we feel better."
   Wang will take one-time charges related to the planned
sales of its international leasing business, its Intecom
subsidiary and a financial information services business,
which are expected to be completed in a few weeks. Wang
previously announced sales agreements but hasn't disclosed
the write-offs. Charges will cover reductions from book value
and certain tax contingencies related to the leasing
business.
   Following the sales, Wang will pay off bank debt, reducing
such debt to $65 million. That would be down from $575
million last summer when Wang faced the credit crunch that
led to Mr. Miller's being hired to succeed Frederick A. Wang,
son of the late founder and chairman, An Wang. In that period
Wang has arranged to sell $600 million of "non-strategic"
assets, and still plans to sell $200 million more, Mr. Miller
said.
   In addition to its bank debt, Wang has $450 million in
long-term debt at relatively low interest rates.
   Mr. Miller said that as a result of the cost cutting and
lower interest costs, Wang is "on a path that will come very
close to operating break-even" before interest costs for the
fourth quarter, ending June 30. In the year-ago fourth
quarter Wang reported a restated record net loss of $374.7
million, or $2.29 a share, on revenue of $741.3 million.
Previously, Mr. Miller had said that he hoped Wang would
return to profitability during the quarter.
   Data General's loss was "less than I'd been forecasting,"
said Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter. Data
General is changing from a company that makes proprietary
computer systems to one that makes industry-standard
computers that use the Unix operating system. However, its
proprietary business has been shrinking faster than the new
business grows.
   Ronald Skates, president and chief executive officer, said
that the second-quarter results were an improvement from the
first quarter and said "we expect that second-half results
will show an improvement over the first six months. We are
beginning to see evidence that the strategic steps we have
taken will allow us to grow and become profitable."
   Wang's Class B shares closed yesterday at $4.75, off 12.5
cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. Data
General closed at $9.50, up 50 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
