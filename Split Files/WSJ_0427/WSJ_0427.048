   The havoc visited on Wall Street since the 1987 stock
market crash has hit women even harder than men. Let into the
club in significant numbers only a decade ago, many now have
been laid off or shoved aside as Joanies-come-lately in the
frantic downsizing of a chastened but not chaste industry.
   So what's next? "Wall Street Women" (Knopf, 177 pages,
$19.95) by Anne Fisher, a former Fortune magazine reporter,
advertises on its jacket that the reader will be told how the
Street and women fared in the 1980s and where they are going
in 1990s. The book does better with the history than with the
speculation.

   As a chronicle of the turbulent past, "Wall Street Women"
is an often-compelling narrative, told through the voices of
top-ranking financial women. Interviewing female traders,
money managers, analysts and deal makers about their jobs,
the author finds these women as determined to succeed as
their male counterparts. They work just as well as men under
intense pressure and abnormally long hours.
   But they are different from the men around them. They are
less likely to value themselves mainly by their positions or
salaries. They seem to know that men find women scary who
make salaries in six or seven figures, and as a result Wall
Street women try to marry men making just as much money as
they do or who are in professions that aren't measured by
money: artists, writers, academics.
   They also are reluctant to spend the enormous incomes they
earn as freely as their male peers. Yes, many have the
obligatory second house in Connecticut or the Hamptons. But
most avoid the ostentation and conspicuous consumption
typical of their male counterparts. Indeed, ambivalence about
the unreal pay scales, slavish hours and recent market
turmoil are causing many to rethink their lives.
   All of this is told in an engaging style, without
bitterness, cynicism or, unfortunately, much that is new.
Throughout the four segments of the book (the work
environment, attitudes toward money, their background, and
finding a sense of balance), the reader is frustrated by Ms.
Fisher's seeming reluctance to probe.
   For example, C. Austin Fitts, the first female partner at
Dillon, Read &amp; Co., now commissioner of the Federal Housing
Administration in Washington, is shown describing her view of
how to get ahead: "If you're a `girl,' men hesitate to yell
at you if you do something stupid. And sometimes the only way
to learn is by getting yelled at. So I always sought out
people to work for who would yell at me. People that nobody
else wanted to work for, because they were known as
screamers. And I'm tough on the young women who work for me."
   But does she scream at them? And what do the women who
work for her make of hard-boiled Ms. Fitts? The author didn't
ask. Nor did she press Marilyn LaMarche, the first and only
female managing director at Lazard Freres &amp; Co., who followed
a kinder, gentler route to success: "You have to know how to
read and write well, and you have to know how to analyze a
financial statement. But more important than that: You must
have humility. You must have integrity. And you must work
hard."
   Fine. But why is there only one woman partner at Lazard
Freres? How hard did Ms. LaMarche have to lobby the guys to
get promoted? And is it only the women who were expected to
be humble in an industry known for its arrogance? I felt like
begging the author to at least ask the questions.
   And what of the future of women in this business?
   Ellen Lee's views of her work as an investment banker at
Ernst &amp; Co. suggest to me that now may be the time for us to
cling to what women have been traditionally taught. "Figuring
out what others need and want, and then bending over backward
to provide it, are skills traditionally inculcated and
encouraged in girls, not boys. Men are awful at it
generally," Ms. Lee notes. "The Street has a male dominated
personality. There's a lot of strategizing going on, but not
much real planning."
   The reader would like these thoughts put in a larger
context. Do other women agree? Is there a growing recognition
among men that women with traditional feminine skills are
needed as a part of a team approach to a client? Do those
skills work better in larger firms or smaller firms, where
every person must count? Indeed, is there any common ground
between the advocates of screaming and those reflecting a
more "feminine" approach? "Wall Street Women" offers few
answers.
   Although the book fails to probe where it should, it does
provide valuable anecdotal evidence of how a wide variety of
styles has worked and can continue to work for women in a
world that until a few years ago almost totally excluded us.
We're here, and despite the layoffs, despite the volatility
of the financial markets and the disintegration of
established firms, we're here to stay.
