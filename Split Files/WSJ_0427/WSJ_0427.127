   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. said that 782
employees, or just under 1% of its work force, accepted an
early retirement package as part of the company's previously
announced plan to trim expense growth.
   The company, which makes computers and test and
measurement equipment, said the plan was available on a
voluntary basis to every employee at least 55 years old with
15 or more years of service with the company. Up to 2,400
workers were eligible for the early retirement package.

amount equal to one-half month's salary for each year of
service, up to a maximum of 12 months' salary. In addition,
retirees received the funds that had accumulated in their
accounts under the company's regular retirement plans.
   The company has 94,000 employees world-wide.
