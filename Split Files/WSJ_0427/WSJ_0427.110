   Stock prices rose modestly even as the ailing bond market
took another turn for the worse that pushed the yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond above 9%.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.14 points to
2676.58 in moderate trading. But broader market averages
didn't perform as well. Analysts also noted that more issues
on the New York Stock Exchange fell than rose, a signal that
investors remain unenthusiastic about stocks. The dollar
strengthened against most foreign currencies.

   Stock prices tracked bond prices in early trading, rising
a bit as the long-bond price rose, then falling in tandem
with declining bonds. But as bond prices continued to sink
through much of the day, stocks reversed course and rose,
helped in part by some better-than-expected first-quarter
earnings reports.
   But analysts cautioned that with the yield on the
Treasury's benchmark issue now above the psychologically
important 9% level, stock prices almost certainly can't hold
at current levels. They said first-quarter earnings reports,
although in some instances surprisingly good, aren't nearly
strong enough overall to insulate stock prices from the
effects of rapidly rising interest rates.
   "This break above 9% is very serious," said Ken Spence,
director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers.
"The stock market's response may lag a little bit, but some
event will set investors off."
   Mr. Spence said yesterday's price gains came largely from
computer-assisted program trading related to stock index
arbitrage. But he pointed out that for much of April, more
issues have fallen in daily trading than have risen. "That
says the broad market is much weaker than the Dow," he said.
   But even the bigger, well-known and more liquid blue-chip
stocks in the Dow average offer only temporary safety if
rates continue rising, and eventually will come under selling
pressure, he predicted.
   In any case, investors are looking to today's release of
the government's estimated first-quarter gross national
product as the potential event that could set off big moves
in both stock and bond prices. While economists are
predicting that first-quarter economic growth will come in at
about 2.7%, more than twice the fourth-quarter growth rate of
1.1%, some bond traders are worried that it will be even
higher. If that's the case, bond prices could tumble still
further, taking stock prices with them.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed in modest trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 141.3 million shares. But
declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 764
to 677.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6803 marks and 159.23 yen, compared
to 1.6785 marks and 158.75 yen Wednesday.
