   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Maxtor Corp. said it named one of its
executives, Taroon Kamdar, president of a unit formed to
manage the assets of troubled disk-maker MiniScribe Corp.
   Mr. Kamdar, 44 years old, has been running the Longmont,
Colo.-based MiniScribe since the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Denver approved Maxtor's $46 million bid for MiniScribe's
assets earlier this month. Maxtor, which makes data-storage
products, said Mr. Kamdar retains his position as Maxtor's
vice president for corporate development.

   MiniScribe, which last year said its previous management
had improperly manipulated its financial results, sought
protection in January from creditors under the federal
Bankruptcy Code after it was unable to settle a number of
lawsuits and bondholder lawsuits against it.
