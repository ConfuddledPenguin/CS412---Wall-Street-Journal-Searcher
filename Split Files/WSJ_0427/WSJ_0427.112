   WASHINGTON -- Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways
and Means Committee said he would consider cutting the
capital-gains tax as part of a large deficit-reduction
package negotiated with the White House.
   In answer to a question during an address to the National
Venture Capital Association, the Illinois Democrat said "a
package could be put together that could possibly include
capital gains," and added, "I'm a fellow who works in the
vineyard of compromise."

   The comments clarify what has gone largely unspoken --
particularly by Mr. Rostenkowski: One reason President Bush
might eventually embrace a big tax-increase and spending-cut
bill is that the package is a probable vehicle for the
capital-gains cut he wants.
   The comments also point up the common wisdom among
lawmakers and policy makers here that the most likely
solution to the fiscal stalemate this year is a summit
between leading lawmakers and high-level Bush administration
officials.
   Officially, Rep. Rostenkowski opposes the capital-gains
tax cut. Indeed, his prepared speech to the venture
capitalists, who are leading the fight to cut the tax,
asserted that he is prepared to make a "comprehensive case
against a preferential capital-gains tax rate."
   But his rhetoric softened when questioning turned to
compromises that might be necessary to accomplish Rep.
Rostenkowski's main goal this year, deficit reduction. In
effect, he said that compromises might be necessary to attain
the kind of budget cuts and tax increases that would
translate into a meaningful reduction in the budget deficit.
To date, President Bush has resisted supporting major tax
increases.
   Rep. Rostenkowski intends to pressure President Bush to
convene a summit by declining to move forward in earnest to
draft a tax-increase bill. Without an agreement on a tax
bill, he said, there looms the likelihood of automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law,
which neither lawmakers nor the administration prefer.
   Specifically, the chairman told a separate group
representing Coretech, a coalition of companies and
universities that is lobbying to extend the research and
development tax credit, that he intends to delay any tax bill
until there is a summit agreement. He would do that by
refusing to recommend a starting point for his tax-writing
committee, he said.
   "I intend not to do that until such time as there is some
movement," he told the group. The purpose, he explained, is
"to build a fire under 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," the address
of the White House.
   In the Senate, Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine)
said in an interview that although he would discuss any
matter with the president, he intends to move forward with
the regular budget process, which involves approving a budget
resolution and following its outlines with tax-and-spending
legislation.
   In slow-moving congressional budget deliberations, the
House rejected two Republican-sponsored alternatives to a
fiscal 1991 deficit-reduction plan backed by the Democratic
leadership. The Democrats' plan -- to cut defense spending
more than President Bush seeks, to spend more on domestic
programs and to raise more in taxes -- is likely to pass the
House Tuesday after the lawmakers consider the Bush budget
and one crafted by the Congressional Black Caucus.
   The Senate Budget Committee made little progress towards
reaching consensus, even among its Democratic majority. In
something of a sideshow, the committee rebuffed a largely
symbolic attempt by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) to get an
endorsement of a reduction in the Social Security payroll tax
by $36.5 billion. Several senators who voted no said they
still favor cutting the payroll tax, but only if the plan is
coupled with a way to make up the lost revenue.
   The committee also rejected three Democratic-sponsored
plans that would have trimmed the deficit more than either
the House or the administration has proposed, primarily with
bigger defense cuts and larger tax increases.
