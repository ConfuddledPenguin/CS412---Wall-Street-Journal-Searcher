   Work resumed on normal schedules at General Motors Corp.'s
three vehicle assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario, after some
workers walked off the job on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The Canadian Auto Workers union employees left work to
protest the suspension of a local union leader by GM. But CAW
President Bob White called the walkout a violation of union
policies and urged the workers to return to their jobs.

   GM said it lost about 5 1/2 shifts of production, or about
30,000 cars and trucks, because of the work stoppage. The
auto maker assembles Buick Regal and Chevrolet Lumina
midsized cars as well as pickup trucks at the three Oshawa
plants.
   The auto maker called the strike illegal and met with the
Ontario labor relations board yesterday to discuss the
problem.
