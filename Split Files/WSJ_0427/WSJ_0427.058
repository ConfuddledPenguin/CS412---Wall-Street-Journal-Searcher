   SEOUL -- South Korea's net foreign debt increased 45% to
$4.37 billion at the end of February from $3.01 billion at
the end of 1989, according to the Economic Planning Board.
   The government agency said that during this year's first
two months South Korea's total foreign debt decreased to
$28.9 billion from $29.4 billion. The nation's overseas
assets also fell, to $24.4 billion from $26.3 billion. Net
foreign debt equals total foreign debt minus overseas assets.

   The decrease in overseas assets largely reflects the
country's growing trade deficit in recent months that lowered
foreign-exchange holdings by the central and commercial banks
here, according to an official at the agency.
