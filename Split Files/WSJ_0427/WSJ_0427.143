   First Boston Corp. acquired a 40% equity stake in Sealy
Corp., formerly Ohio Mattress Co., in a restructuring of its
ill-fated $457 million bridge loan that became known as "the
burning bed."
   First Boston, a unit of CS First Boston Inc., plans to use
the equity in an eventual attempt to resell the debt to
investors in the battered market for high-risk, high-yield
junk bonds. But the timing of that new sale remains
uncertain.

   The first attempt to refinance the temporary bridge loan,
which enabled the leveraged buy-out firm of Gibbons, Green,
van Amerongen to acquire Ohio Mattress for about $965 million
a year ago, flopped last August just before the junk-bond
market collapsed. The loan then became one of many "hung
bridges" that Wall Street couldn't refinance.
   First Boston acquired the equity stake from Gibbons Green
and other holders in exchange for converting the bridge loan
into permanent financing at rates lower than those of up to
about 20% that it could have imposed unilaterally under terms
of the bridge.
   The terms reduce the stake of a group led by Gibbons Green
from about 90% to 50% on a fully diluted basis. In the same
restructuring, banks that lent Sealy $465 million agreed to
extend the maturity of some debts falling due in 1990 and
1991. Both Gibbons Green and First Boston also forfeited $17
million in fees they would have received under the original
buy-out terms.
   The agreement set a rate of 14% on $250 million in senior
cash paying notes, and 15.5% on $213 million of subordinated
notes that don't pay cash interest until 1993. Since March,
the senior notes have been held by CS Holding, which owns
44.5% of CS First Boston.
   Despite the extra equity, First Boston faces an uphill
struggle to recover the full amount of the loan because it
probably can't resell the bonds for their full face value
under current market conditions. The interest rates are
modest for junk bonds, and the market for non-cash-paying
bonds remains especially weak.
   However, Sealy chairman Malcolm Candlish said the
restructuring gives the company "financial stability which
will enable management to pursue its business strategy
aggressively." The maker of Sealy and Stearns &amp; Foster
mattresses was renamed Sealy Corp. in March. It reported a
loss of about $25 million for the year ended Nov. 30, 1989,
on sales of $702 million.
   First Boston wouldn't comment on whether it expects to
recoup its entire bridge-loan investment. The firm made an
unspecified provision last year against possible losses in
its merchant banking activities. David M. Malcolm, head of
the firm's high-yield finance group, said only, "We're very
comfortable with our position."
   The new terms give Sealy only a little breathing room.
Last year, Sealy reported earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation of $105 million. The new debt structure requires
$81 million in annual cash interest payments, plus non-cash
interest of $33 million annually that comes due in 1993.
