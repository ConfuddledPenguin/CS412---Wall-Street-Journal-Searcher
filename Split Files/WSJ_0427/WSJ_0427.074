   With the General Accounting Office's March 29 report on
the results of the sanctions on employers who hire illegal
aliens, the immigration debate has taken a curious turn. As
proponents of high levels of immigration, many conservatives
opposed these sanctions, mandated in the 1986 immigration
law. Perhaps not surprisingly, they now embrace the GAO's
finding that sanctions have led to "widespread
discrimination" against foreign-looking or foreign-sounding
individuals, Hispanics in particular.
   Yet in so doing conservatives have rashly abandoned the
healthy skepticism with which they usually approach the word
"discrimination." As a result, they now risk joining the
chorus encouraging U.S. Hispanics to believe, falsely, that
they are not like other immigrants but are, like black
Americans, a racial minority.

   "Discrimination" of course has multiple and muddied
meanings. Most commonly, it refers to decision-making on the
basis of presumed group deficiencies. Such prejudiced
behavior can be directed against a racial or a national
origin group. In the present debate, however, a quite
different meaning of the word refers to employers
discriminating against national origin groups, not out of
prejudice but out of fear of violating the law.
   Congress ordered the GAO to investigate national origin
discrimination caused by the employer sanctions. One part of
its study, subcontracted to the Urban Institute, focused on
prejudice-based discrimination. In its "hiring audit,"
"matched pairs" of Anglo and Hispanic job applicants
responded to newspaper ads. The result was, "Hispanic testers
were three times as likely to encounter unfavorable treatment
when applying for jobs as were closely matched Anglos."
   Dramatic though it sounds, this finding is far from solid.
It is based on a small sample of employers in only two sites
(Chicago and San Diego), with only four pairs of testers in
each city. Nor were the applicants accurately "matched
pairs."
   I viewed a videotape in which the 16 individual testers
introduced themselves and described their educational
backgrounds. I was struck by the number of instances in which
the Anglo testers attended more selective universities and
displayed more self-assurance than their Hispanic
counterparts. Indeed, the Anglos generally appeared to have a
social class advantage over the Hispanics, which would
explain much of the "discrimination" encountered by the
latter.
   With regard to discrimination directly traceable to fear
of sanctions, the GAO finds that 19% of employers surveyed
have initiated "discriminatory practices" under threat of
sanctions. But a careful reading of the evidence reveals that
only 5% of employers actually refuse to hire those who look
or sound foreign. Most Americans would object to this. But I
doubt whether they would object to the 8% of employers who
failed to verify the status of employees exactly as
prescribed by the law: for example, asking only those who
look or sound foreign for the documents -- Social Security
cards, birth certificates and the like -- actually required
of all employees. Such technical non-compliance is not what
most Americans think of when told sanctions have led to
"widespread discrimination."
   Perhaps the most striking -- and little noted -- evidence
that sanctions-related discrimination has been exaggerated is
the relatively small number of individual complaints
registered with the Office of Special Counsel, established in
the Department of Justice precisely for this purpose. The GAO
reports that during the three-year period that ended on Oct.
30, the Office of Special Counsel received 708 complaints, of
which only about 25% involved sanctions-related
discrimination.
   The GAO itself concludes that "the number of complaints is
low relative to the number of potential complainants." By way
of explanation, the GAO then adds: "Not all those harmed by
discriminatory practices realize that they have been harmed.
For a person to file an OSC charge, they must somehow become
convinced that they have been unfairly treated." But if
"discrimination" related to sanctions is not even noticeable
to its victims, then how seriously can we take the claim that
it is "widespread"?
   As for convincing Hispanics that they are being unfairly
treated, this will not be easy. A January 1989 Los Angeles
Times poll found that 49% of blacks in Southern California
claimed to have experienced at least some discrimination
personally. Only 29% of Hispanics made a similar claim. In
the same vein, fully 56% of Hispanics in the 1980 census
identified themselves as "white." Extensive research on
residential patterns reveals that Hispanic barrios, unlike
black ghettos, are not closed environments from which there
is little or no mobility. Most tellingly, the 1988 Current
Population Survey reports that 17.2% of married Hispanics
have non-Hispanic spouses is 17.2%, five times the figure for
blacks.
   Unfortunately, Hispanic leaders have been less than eager
to accept these facts. Moreover they have strained to confuse
national origin discrimination caused by the 1986 law with
racial discrimination. To be sure, at various times and
places Hispanics have been subjected to something quite close
to racial discrimination. But the evidence on the integration
of Hispanics into American society indicates that they
generally do not face the same problems as blacks -- the
efforts of Hispanic leaders to persuade their people and the
American public to the contrary notwithstanding.
   Hispanic leaders have been abetted in this endeavor by
their liberal allies, such as the Urban Institute spokesman
who recently described the hiring-audit findings as proof
that "what we have here is old-style Jim Crow
discrimination." We have nothing of the sort. We do have a
problem with national-origin discrimination, much of which
involves technical violations of the 1986 immigration act.
   Such problems point to the contradictory demands sanctions
place on employers -- who are forbidden to discriminate
against national origin groups, but obliged to discriminate
against illegal immigrants, many of whom are Hispanic and
Asian. If these demands are intolerable, perhaps sanctions
ought to be repealed.
   But as we debate immigration policy, it is imperative that
the issue not be infused with the passions aroused by the
nation's history of race discrimination. In this debate it is
ironic -- and potentially tragic -- that those most eager to
open wide the doors of freedom and opportunity to immigrants
now ally themselves with those just as eager to persuade
those same immigrants that America is the land of racial
discrimination.
