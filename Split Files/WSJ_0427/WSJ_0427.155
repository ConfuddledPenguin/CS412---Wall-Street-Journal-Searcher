   Cies. Europeennes Reunis said net profit after payments to
minority interests totaled an estimated one billion French
francs ($177.6 million) in 1989, up 52% from 656 million
francs the previous year.
   The holding company for the investments of Carlo De
Benedetti noted, however, that the earnings figures weren't
comparable because of a merger with Dumenil-Leble S.A. in
December.

   Cerus said consolidated revenue totaled 27.5 billion
francs last year.
   Management proposed a net dividend of 10 francs a share,
up from 7.4 francs a share paid out last year, Cerus said. A
shareholders meeting is set for June 20.
   Cerus oversees Mr. De Benedetti's stakes in Valeo S.A.,
Groupe Yves Saint-Laurent S.A., Societe Generale de Belgique
S.A., and other companies in Europe.
