   Four major airlines confirmed predictions of a dismal
March 31 quarter, reporting poor financial results compared
with the year-earlier period.
   UAL Corp. and USAir Group Inc. recorded net losses while
Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each eked out small
profits.

   It is the second consecutive quarter that airline results
have plunged. The primary culprit was an unexpected surge in
the cost of aviation fuel.
   UAL said the average price per gallon of fuel in the first
quarter rose to 73.3 cents, compared with 60.7 cents a year
earlier. The company said the rise contributed to a 23% jump
in fuel expense to $386 million from $315 million. Delta said
that fuel expense rose 27% and that it consumed 5% more than
in the year-earlier fiscal third quarter.
   "The thing that just kicked everybody in the pants was
fuel," said Vivian Lee, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. She estimated that in some cases fuel costs rose 30% from
a year earlier.
   Comparisons with the year-earlier period also were hurt
because the busy Easter weekend this year didn't come until
after March 31. Last year, airlines also reaped a windfall
because of the strike at Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines.
Even with its return, however, Eastern hasn't recaptured that
many passengers, particularly the high-paying business
traveler who is the meat-and-potatoes flier for most
carriers.
   Carriers attempted to boost their financial performance
this year by raising fares several times, but the increases
apparently didn't offset the higher cost of fuel. USAir also
said it was hurt by the number of free tickets it shelled out
under its frequent-flier program.
   UAL, parent company of United Airlines, had a loss of
$36.4 million, or $1.68 a share, compared with year-earlier
profit of $65.4 million, or $3.03 cents a share.
   The Chicago-based carrier was particularly hurt by a
one-time, nonoperating charge of a $77.5 million settlement
it paid to Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit. The
settlement covered several lawsuits in which United was
charged with unfairly competing in the computer-reservation
business.
   Revenue rose 8.1% to $2.52 billion from $2.33 billion. At
a shareholders' meeting, UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said he
was "clearly disappointed" by the results. Without the
one-time charge, results would have still been poor, he said.
   UAL stock fell 25 cents yesterday to close at $152.50 a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   USAir reported a first-quarter loss of $38 million, or
$1.05 a share, compared with net of $15.5 million, or 35
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue barely increased to
$1.54 billion from $1.48 billion.
   Jack T. Ciesielski, an airline analyst at Legg Mason Wood
Walker Inc. in Baltimore, said improvements in on-time
performance and pilot scheduling kept USAir's results from
looking worse. Problems in both areas hampered the carrier
through the fourth quarter.
   USAir stock rose 25 cents to close at $27.50 in
yesterday's Big Board trading.
   Although both Delta and Southwest reported profits,
earnings were sharply down from a year earlier.
   Delta said net income fell 63% to $31.3 million, or 48
cents a share, from $85 million, or $1.73 a share, a year
earlier. Like its competitors, Delta blamed the decrease
primarily on the soaring cost of jet fuel. But the carrier
acknowledged it would be hard-pressed to match the
year-earlier numbers, when traffic was inflated by the strike
at Eastern that sent travelers scurrying to Delta.
   Still, Delta was able to increase its revenue 4% to $2.12
billion from $2.04 billion. Strong business traffic, higher
fares and more cargo business helped keep revenue high, said
Thomas Roeck, Delta's chief financial officer.
   In the first nine months, Delta net fell 15% to $228.7
million, or $4.15 a share, from $270.1 million, or $5.49 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.8% to $6.34 billion
from $5.78 billion.
   In the quarter, Delta bought back 2,988,200 common shares
for $202.3 million, bringing the total number of shares
bought back to 6,255,662, at a total cost of $438.8 million.
Last year, in an effort to make a takeover of the company
more difficult, Delta placed 14% of its shares in an employee
stock option plan and sold 5% stakes each to friendly
carriers, Singapore Airlines and Swissair.
   Delta stock rose $1.125 a share yesterday to close at $74
in Big Board composite trading.
   Southwest's first-quarter net fell 74% to $5.1 million, or
18 cents a share, from $19.6 million, or 64 cents a share, a
year earlier. Dallas-based Southwest said higher fuel prices
pushed its operating expenses up 21.7%.
   In addition, the carrier said profit was further squeezed
by a decrease in nonoperating gains of $7.2 million. The
first quarter of 1989 was a record for Southwest.
   Still, revenue rose 14% to $260.6 million from $229.4
million.
   In a statement, Herbert D. Kelleher, Southwest's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said he was grateful
"to report even a meager first-quarter profit." He called the
most recent period "one of the most difficult quarters in the
history of the airline industry."
   Southwest's stock rose 25 cents yesterday to close at
$24.25 a share in Big Board trading.
   AMR Corp., American Airlines' parent and the first carrier
to release March 31 quarter results, set the tone for the
industry last week when it reported a $19.3 million loss.
   Of the major airline holding companies, only Pan Am Corp.
and Texas Air have yet to report results. They aren't
expected to buck the industry trend; analysts figure their
results will disclose big first-quarter losses.
