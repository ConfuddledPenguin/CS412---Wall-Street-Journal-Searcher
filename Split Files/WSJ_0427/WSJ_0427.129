   NEW YORK -- Number-crunching "technicians" are finding it
harder than usual to fall in love with stock charts these
days.
   For every favorite stock, "I think there are 10 least
favorites," says analyst Stan Weinstein as he pores over
charts of the price and volume action in various companies'
shares.

   Mr. Weinstein is currently among the more bearish of
technical analysts, also known as chartists. Many of them
find little to get enthusiastic about in today's stock
market. Still, almost all of them have some charts they like.
   The accompanying graphic shows the favorite and least
favorite stocks of three prominent technicians.
   Technicians often don't know -- and say they don't care --
about the details of a company's business. Looking at a chart
doesn't tell them whether a company is profiting from motor
oil or magazines nor what the company is expected to earn
this year. Such matters are the province of "fundamental"
analysts, a breed that scorns the chartists, who often return
the sentiment.
   By studying a stock's price and volume trends, chartists
believe they get clues to future price changes before the
fundamental rationale for them is known. Nearly every major
brokerage house employs at least one technician. And some
successful money managers use technical analysis as part of
their arsenal.
   While technicians vary in their methods, most have a few
techniques in common. They typically are encouraged when a
stock's trading volume rises during price upswings and
declines during price dips. That, they say, is a sign of
strong underlying demand.
   Most technicians are intrigued when a stock price goes
flat for a while. If the flattening out follows a significant
drop, then it's a possible "base" for a future advance. If it
follows a long climb it may be a "top," signaling a decline
to come. Many technicians like lengthy bases, viewing them as
a sign that a subsequent advance will be big and sustainable.
   Dick Arms, vice president of Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner in
Albuquerque, N.M., is a technician's technician who devised
the Arms index (also known as the Trading Index, or TRIN), a
market-timing measure shown on most traders' electronic quote
machines. He believes that the market could rally in the next
few days but that stock prices will slide again in May.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be stuck in a
trading range of 2520 to 2820, Mr. Arms says. "We've been
back and forth in that range three times" since September. If
the industrial average breaks out of that range, he fears it
may be on the downside: He worries that the "wide sideways"
action of the average since October 1989 may represent a top.
   His favorite chart right now is that of Unisys, a computer
maker that "has been a dog for a long time," Mr. Arms says.
But now investors are "accumulating the stock. People are
sneaking into it." After a "climactic" decline in November on
heavy volume, he says, Unisys has been building a base.
   Lately, Unisys has shown increasing volume on advances,
Mr. Arms says, and "each time it dipped down, you get light
volume on those dips." Accordingly, he believes the stock,
which closed yesterday at 14 1/8 down 1/8, is poised to rise
into the low to mid-20s. Other charts that are "looking good"
to Mr. Arms are those of Merrill Lynch (at 21 3/4, down 5/8
yesterday), American Express (26 5/8 down 1/4) and Ralston
Purina (84 3/8 up 1 1/4).
   But he doesn't like the look of Tandem Computers, or of
energy stocks such as Chevron, Amoco and Halliburton. "It
looks as though {energy stocks} have run into resistance and
have topped," he says. Tandem had a nice long ride from March
1989 to March 1990, roughly doubling in price. But it
declined on heavy volume in April, and rally attempts since
have been unimpressive.
   Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, also predicts a
"trading-range" market. His favorite chart at the moment
belongs to General Electric.
   GE shares ran up in November and December, rising to 67
from 53. After such a run-up, Mr. Goldman says, weaker issues
usually face heavy profit-taking. But strong issues
consolidate and "work off their overbought condition." That's
just what GE has been doing, he says, "consolidating in the
60 to 66 range" for the past four months.
   Recently GE shares have been strong compared with other
stocks, and Mr. Goldman now thinks they may rise to around
73. GE closed yesterday at 64 5/8, up 1/4.
   Mr. Goldman's least favorite chart is Coca-Cola's. "Coke
worries me for a couple of reasons," he says. "The shares
doubled in 1989. It was one of 1989's biggest winners.
Frequently, last year's winners are the new year's hate
objects." Besides that, he says, the shares look "tired and
toppy," with a reduction in volume on advances and a pickup
in volume on declines. Coca-Cola closed unchanged at 77
yesterday.
   Straying into fundamental analysis for a minute, Mr.
Goldman says Coke shares "were overbulled," partly on
prospects of sales to Eastern Europe. But he thinks such
business will develop only gradually. "Are people going to be
buying Coca-Colas or are they going to be buying toilet
paper?" he asks.
   Mr. Weinstein, the most bearish of the three, is
"extremely negative" on the market outlook for the next three
to six months. One thing that discourages him is the
advance-decline line, a cumulative count of stocks setting
new 52-week highs minus stocks setting new lows.
   A week ago, the advance-decline lines for the New York
Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq
over-the-counter market all closed at new 1990 lows, he says,
and the latter two were at levels below those prevailing
after the 1987 crash. "This isn't {just} the market talking
to us. It's screaming," he says.
   Another bearish sign: a string of several days in which
the Dow Jones Industrial Average was near a high, but the
tally of individual new lows outnumbered that of new highs.
In the past two decades, Mr. Weinstein says, that situation
has previously arisen only in 1973, 1981 and 1987 -- each
time before a big market decline.
   Mr. Weinstein expects a little rally to around 2,700 on
the Dow. "I would say thank you very much, and sell into it,"
he says. He then expects the average to drop below 2600, and
warns that if it falls below 2520 he sees no real support
until below 2300.
   Among the most vulnerable stocks, he believes, are
insurance issues, particularly General Re and American
International Group. "I would sell all insurance stocks," he
advises.
   But even Mr. Weinstein has a few charts that look good to
him, notably Oakwood Homes and Clayton Homes. "The mobile
home sector is coming to life," he says. "After getting
bombed," his index of mobile-home stocks has "formed a base,
and recently moved above its 30-week moving average," he
says.
