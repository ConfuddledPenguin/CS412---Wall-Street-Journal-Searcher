   How would you like to invest with legendary stock picker
Warren Buffett -- and only pay $55.625?
   Sounds like a bargain, given that people who want to
invest with Mr. Buffett were yesterday paying $6,650. That's
the price of a single share of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the
New York Stock Exchange company that Mr. Buffett runs.

   But unknown to most investors, there is actually a second
way to get a piece of Mr. Buffett's stock-picking skill.
Among Berkshire's holdings is an 80.1%-owned subsidary, Wesco
Financial Corp., which trades on the American Stock Exchange.
   Wesco may not be as good a value as Berkshire, in part
because its core businesses aren't considered as strong and
its stock portfolio is less stellar. Moreover, Wesco's stock
trades with alarming infrequency. And some think Mr.
Buffett's returns in the 1990s won't match those he produced
in the 1970s and 1980s. But Wesco does have this one
endearing trait: Its price is well within the reach of the
small investor.
   Within Warren Buffett's empire, Wesco is something of an
aberration. Berkshire acquired majority control of Wesco
through a series of tender offers in the early 1970s. At the
time, Wesco's largest shareholders included the Caspers
family; two family members still sit on Wesco's board. At the
request of the Caspers family, Berkshire hasn't bought the
rest of Wesco's shares, leaving the company publicly traded.
   Like Berkshire, Wesco masquerades as an ordinary operating
company, but it's really a mutual fund in disguise. Just as
Berkshire is supposedly an insurance company, so Wesco at
first blush appears to be a savings and loan. Look a little
closer, and you find that a securities portfolio accounts for
a hefty chunk of both companies' assets.
   Wesco has stakes in much-publicized Buffett stock
purchases such as Coca-Cola Co. and Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., as well as the convertible preferred stocks
of Salomon Inc., Gillette Co., Champion International Corp.
and USAir Group Inc. Indeed, Wesco has recently participated
in almost every major securities investment that Mr. Buffett
has made.
   But before you rush out to buy Wesco's stock, be warned:
It's extremely thinly traded. On a typical day, 1,300 shares
trade hands. Wednesday, the stock didn't trade at all.
   "It's one of those you buy and lock it up and forget about
it," advises Donald Yacktman, manager of Selected American
Shares, a no-load mutual fund. He says the stock is too
thinly traded to buy for his fund. "I own some personally,
and my {private account} clients do as well," he says.
   Mr. Yacktman predicts that, over the long haul, Berkshire
Hathaway's stock will likely turn out to be a better
performer than Wesco's. But Wesco's stock still warrants
attention -- for two different reasons.
   One reason is the so-called Buffett premium. Through most
of 1988 and 1989, shares of Berkshire have traded at a steep
premium to the value of Berkshire's stock portfolio and its
businesses, making Wesco seem more attractive.
   With Berkshire's stock now at $6,650, down from last
year's high of $8,900, the Buffett premium is clearly
narrowing. John Tilson, a portfolio manager with Roger
Engemann &amp; Associates, reckons Berkshire has a value of
$6,600 a share, before deducting the capital gains taxes that
would be payable if the company sold its stock positions.
After tax, Mr. Tilson puts Berkshire's value at $5,850 a
share.
   But even as the Buffett premium shrinks, there's a second
reason investors have found Wesco attractive compared with
Berkshire. The fact is, you have to ante up $6,650 to get
into Berkshire. Mr. Buffett has steadfastly refused to split
Berkshire's stock, so today it trades far above the $1,000
minimum investment that's typically needed to get into a
mutual fund. For small investors who want to get their money
professionally managed, Berkshire's stock can be simply too
expensive.
   Mr. Buffett is neither an officer nor a director of Wesco.
But together with Charles Munger, Wesco's chairman and Mr.
Buffett's longtime business partner, he runs the company in
his own unique way.
   Wesco's savings and loan, for instance, made no new loans
between 1979 and 1985, because Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger
were concerned about rising interest rates. In 1980, the
thrift sold off 15 branch offices, leaving it with a single
branch, situated in a shopping mall across the street from
the thrift's headquarters in Pasadena, Calif. Wesco also
operates three other businesses: an insurance company and two
small industrial companies. In addition, Wesco owns a
Pasadena office building, part of which it occupies, and 22
acres of oceanfront property in Santa Barbara that it is
currently developing.
   Wesco's book value is slightly under $40, but the
company's real value is somewhat higher than that, largely
because of appreciation by its real estate holdings and its
securities portfolio.
   Geoffrey Ward, vice president of Breau Capital Management
in Waltham, Mass., reckons the company's real book value,
adjusted for this appreciation but less potential capital
gains taxes, is around $50.
   Wesco thus trades at an 11% premium to its adjusted book
value, compared with a 14% premium for Berkshire. But, warns
Mr. Ward, Wesco's "core businesses are not as good as the
Buffalo News or See's Candies" and the other core holdings of
Berkshire Hathaway.
   Moreover, unlike Berkshire, Wesco doesn't have stakes in
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Geico Corp. and Washington Post Co.,
all of which have been big winners for Berkshire's
shareholders.
   In this year's letter to Berkshire's shareholders, Mr.
Buffett noted that the stock prices of these companies were
no longer "inappropriately low," though he expected Berkshire
to benefit from the healthy gains in business value that
these core holdings would continue to notch up.
   When it comes to the four convertible preferred that
Berkshire has acquired since 1987, Mr. Buffett's enthusiasm
is more tempered. In Berkshire's annual report, Mr. Buffett
expressed confidence in Gillette, but declared himself an
agnostic when it came to the prospects for Champion, Salomon
and USAir, all of which Wesco also owns.
   But while Wesco has ended up with these apparently
less-promising deals, it has also benefited from Mr.
Buffett's two most recent, long-term stock purchases,
Coca-Cola and Federal Home Loan Mortgage, known as Freddie
Mac.
   Indeed, Freddie Mac is Wesco's biggest holding, and
accounts for Mr. Buffett's entire position in the stock. For
every share of Wesco, you currently get Freddie Mac stock
valued at more than $22. "It's a back doorway to get Freddie
Mac, which is cheap," says Mr. Yacktman. "Freddie Mac is the
second largest holding in my fund."
   At the Caspers family's behest, Mr. Buffett has allowed
Wesco to continue paying a dividend, despite his own
misgivings about dividend payments. Berkshire doesn't pay a
dividend, so as to avoid the double taxation of corporate
earnings that results. If a company pays a dividend, it first
gets taxed on its earnings, and then its shareholders get
taxed on the dividends they receive.
