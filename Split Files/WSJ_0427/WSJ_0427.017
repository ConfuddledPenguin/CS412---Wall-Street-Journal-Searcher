   New York -- When Dawn Upshaw gave a recital with pianist
Richard Goode at New York's 92nd Street Y in early February,
something seemed amiss.
   It wasn't Ms. Upshaw's pure, alluring soprano. That was in
place. But in her half-dozen years before the public, this
29-year-old artist, who won a Grammy this year for a
recording of American music ("Knoxville: Summer of 1915"),
has set an extremely high standard for herself. But at the
February recital, that freedom of sound, that warmth, that
essential Dawnness -- just weren't all there.

   Chalk one up to biology: Ms. Upshaw gave birth to her
first child, Sarah, on Nov. 15 -- and was back on stage Jan.
23.
   Pregnancy, birth and the first weeks of motherhood can be
grueling enough for women with desk jobs or no jobs at all.
For singers, the physical and hormonal changes that affect
the voice and the career pressures that make it difficult to
say no to engagements during and just after pregnancy take
their own special toll.
   Of course, that doesn't stop singers from going back to
work right away: There was the singer who did the Dance of
the Seven Veils in "Salome" six weeks after giving birth, and
the one who was back on stage one week postpartum.
   Dr. Robert T. Sataloff, professor of otolaryngology at
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, and a singer and
teacher of voice himself, advises women to begin singing
again only when they are "pain-free" -- usually about four to
six weeks after delivery -- or when they can do aerobic
exercise and 10 situps. In this way they should be in
performance condition about three months after birth.
   That's the medical view. But many singers assert that
having a child is good for the voice. The famous
turn-of-the-century contralto Ernestine Schumann-Heink
insisted that she picked up a note at either end of her range
with the birth of each of her numerous children. Juliana
Gondek, whose daughter, Cecilia, now is 19 months old, says
her voice became "clearer, with less distortion around the
tone." Sheri Greenawald, who has a four-year-old, says
singers "go through a vocal crisis because of the change in
the body. Things get either better or worse." Her voice, she
says, got bigger, and it took her a year to figure out what
to do with it.
   Vocal changes during pregnancy are documented in medical
literature. According to Dr. Sataloff: "Hormonal changes
cause fluid retention in the vocal chords that can alter the
character of the voice, and make it less efficient, more
easily fatigued and lose range."
   These changes usually go away after birth, though women
who breast-feed often find that their high notes remain
elusive. Dr. Sataloff says the most common enduring problem
women have is with their technique. "In the later months of
pregnancy, it becomes more difficult to flex the abdominal
muscles because of the size of the fetus. If women sing
through this period, without support, they often start using
bad technique, which can damage the vocal folds and establish
bad habits that persist beyond pregnancy . . ."
   Women who do restudy, however, can make the changes work
to their advantage: Ms. Gondek says she got used to using
extra support during her pregnancy, and believes the
increased efficiency she acquired improved her voice.
   Like all first-time mothers, Ms. Upshaw thought she had it
all planned perfectly. She sang concerts until about a month
before her due date -- she says she never felt any strain,
only exhaustion -- and canceled everything else until that
Jan. 23 concert. "I thought, this will be easy," she says.
"My husband will be at home, and if we need sitters, we'll
get them."
   The baby was right on time, but life wasn't easy -- it was
overwhelming. "When I wasn't feeding or changing Sarah, I
would sit during the day, waiting for her to wake up and
thinking, how will I go back to my old life?" Ms. Upshaw
says. She started practicing, as planned, four weeks after
giving birth. Only to her horror, nothing came out. "I
couldn't do it," she says. "The chords weren't vibrating.
There was no sound."
   Ms. Upshaw's voice teacher, Ellen Faull, recommends two or
three months of rest after birth. "Psychologically, you need
the space," Ms. Faull says. "Four weeks was a little
premature. But singers want to know that it's still there."
Ms. Upshaw didn't try singing again for another four weeks,
getting increasingly nervous and impatient. "I had a lot of
music to get into my voice. Finally I had to change the
program for my recitals with Richard."
   Ms. Upshaw then spent February dashing back and forth to
Boston for concerts, with baby and husband in tow. By the
time she started the stressful rehearsals for her first
Zerlina in the Metropolitan Opera's new Franco Zeffirelli
production of "Don Giovanni," she was exhausted from travel
and getting up during the night to nurse.
   Having a baby to go home to paradoxically made things
easier for Ms. Upshaw. "For the first time, I felt that I
have my family, and I have my work," she says. "I'd come
home, she'd be smiling -- she doesn't care what I do. It was
very soothing. I felt that nothing in my work could matter so
much that I needed to get upset about it.
   Ms. Upshaw has been told that her voice sounds "older,
more mature" since her daughter's birth. She also has found
that some upper-register singing is easier, which she thinks
may be because after a few months without singing, she has
been able to "start over fresh" and eradicate a few bad
habits. With only concerts and no opera ahead for the next
few months, she hopes to be able to relax a bit and watch
Sarah learn to sit up. Next time, she says, she'll wait three
months for her first postpartum engagement.
                                                                                                       

   On April 13, Ms. Upshaw sang the Mozart "Requiem" with
Trevor Pinnock and the Classical Band at Carnegie Hall. The
warmth and the floating, rippling, live sound -- that
essential Dawnness -- were back.
