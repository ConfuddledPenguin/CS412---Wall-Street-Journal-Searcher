VEB IFA-Kombinat Personenkraftwagen.

   Volkswagen has said it expects its total auto
manufacturing joint-venture project with VEB IFA-Kombinat to
cost about five billion marks ($2.98 billion). In March, the
company said that it will invest an initial 350 million marks
and that it plans to assemble about 50 Volkswagen Polos daily
in a plant near Zwickau.
   Volkswagen said that 400 dealers in East Germany have
already been nominated for marketing of Volkswagen and Audi,
and 140 for marketing of SEAT. Through the dealer network,
Volkswagen said, its entire auto program, including the sale
of used cars, is to be made available.
