   Philip Morris Cos. said its shareholders defeated a
resolution that would have required the company to cease its
business in tobacco products after Dec. 31, 1999.
   The New York-based packaged goods maker said its
shareholders also rejected a proposal to establish a review
committee to determine, among other things, the impact of
promotions and advertising on childrens' decision to smoke.
