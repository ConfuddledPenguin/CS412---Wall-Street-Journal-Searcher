   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Aztar Corp., the casino operator
recently spun off by Ramada Inc., expects to report
first-quarter net income of 20 cents to 23 cents a share, or
$8.2 million to $9.4 million, Paul E. Rubeli, president and
chief executive officer, said.
   "This is the first quarter that Aztar hasn't been
cluttered with the effects of the restructuring, and we're
pleased with the results," Mr. Rubeli said.

   In the 1989 first quarter, Ramada had a net loss of $18.6
million, or 47 cents a share. Those results included
reorganization-related costs of about $2 million, as well as
losses from a Reno, Nev., casino that was closed in June
1989. Revenue rose to about $125 million from $118.5 million.
   Aztar was formed last year to acquire the casino assets of
Ramada Inc., whose lodging assets were bought for $540
million by New World Development Co. of Hong Kong. Aztar is
focused on the gambling industry and operates three casinos
in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J.
   The earnings will include a gain of about $4.1 million
from the sale of the Tropicana golf course and country club
in Las Vegas. The results will reflect tax-loss
carry-forwards that will offset income tax expense of about
$3.3 million.
   Casino revenue should show an increase of 9% to about $98
million, Mr. Rubeli said. Last year's quarterly casino
results suffered from an unusually low win rate at the Las
Vegas Tropicana, meaning that customers hit a lucky streak at
the casinos' expense. The win rate improved in the 1990
quarter but was still a little soft, Mr. Rubeli said.
   Costs and expenses have been trimmed substantially, as
last year's results included start-up costs from both the
Atlantic City and Laughlin facilities. TropWorld in Atlantic
City cut the number of bused-in patrons 44% in the first
quarter, and its revenue from slot-machines has risen.
   As expected, TropWorld is feeling the effects of the
opening of the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and has experienced
a 7.7% drop in casino revenue in the three weeks since the
Taj opened. Mr. Rubeli noted that much of the market's
overall success will depend on the Taj's ability to attract
new business and that it's too early to assess its impact.
   The Las Vegas casino should get a boost from the June
opening of a major new casino across the street, and the
Laughlin property has maintained 98% occupancy at a higher
average room rate over last year, Mr. Rubeli said.
