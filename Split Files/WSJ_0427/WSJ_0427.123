   WASHINGTON -- Makers and importers of products using
chlorofluorocarbons must deposit the first payment of a new
excise tax on the ozone-depleting chemicals by next Monday,
or pay interest on the tax, the Internal Revenue Service
said.
   But because the IRS has yet to issue regulations enacting
the new tax, the agency said it won't slap any additional
penalty on businesses that fail to pay the tax by the due
date. The excise tax, which was passed by Congress last year
and took effect Jan. 1, amounts to $1.37 per pound of CFCs.
Companies will estimate their tax based on the law.

   A wide range of industries have been awaiting word from
the IRS on how and when they are supposed to comply with the
new law. Most excise taxes are reported quarterly, with the
first-quarter returns and payments usually due by April 30.
With that date fast approaching, the IRS yesterday issued a
notice telling taxpayers what to do until the regulations
come out.
   The IRS notice also said that returns for the excise tax
won't be due until 30 days after the agency issues
regulations.
   CFCs are used as coolants; they are also used to make
plastic foam and to clean electronic parts. They are often
found in air conditioners, cars, televisions and an array of
other electronic products.
