   NEW YORK -- ABC News, CBS News and the Cable News Network
last weekend combined camera equipment and videotape crews in
the coverage of the release of Middle East hostage Robert
Polhill, network executives said.
   It is the latest example of the competitors working
together in the news-gathering process of a major foreign
story. According to Ed Turner, executive vice president of
CNN, the all-news network has been "experimenting with
networks on an ad hoc, event-by-event basis in some major
foreign stories for the past several months."

   The cooperation underscores how the major networks are, in
the words of one CBS News official, "grappling" with mounting
costs in the coverage of overseas stories. The official
characterized the Polhill story as an "experiment with how we
can all work together to save money without sacrificing our
competitive edge."
   The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said
the news division, a unit of CBS Inc., would continue to work
together with CNN in sharing equipment "as long as we've
first satisfied Dan Rather," the anchor of the "CBS Evening
News."
   "We think there is a plot by the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian government to bankrupt
the American networks," said CNN's Mr. Turner with some irony
in a telephone interview. "The costs are too much."
   Specifically, the networks cooperated covering different
so-called non-exclusive events last weekend in Damascus,
Syria, where Mr. Polhill was brought after three years of
captivity in Beirut. CBS News and CNN also worked together in
Frankfurt, West Germany, where Mr. Polhill was taken after
Damascus.
   Eason Jordan, international managing editor of CNN, a unit
of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., said, "We all want our
share of exclusives, but taping a hostage coming off a plane
is something that we can cooperate on without losing
editorial independence."
   "The way we distinguish ourselves is through a Charles
Kuralt or Bob Simon script," said the CBS official, referring
to two CBS News correspondents.
   NBC News, a division of General Electric Co.'s National
Broadcasting Co. unit, shared some satellite time with the
British Broadcasting Co. and did not work with its three
competitors.
   A spokesman at ABC News, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC
Inc., said there was "nothing unusual" about the Polhill
cooperation. When there is no "competitive advantage," the
spokesman said, there are "informal pool arrangements"
between the networks. The networks also shared the cost of
transmitting the news footage by satellite, and, indeed, that
is not unusual.
   One network executive estimated that each news division
could have "easily" saved about $12,000 on last weekend's
story. "That's money that could go to enterprising stories,"
said the executive.
   The cooperation between CNN and other networks, in
particular CBS News, is a drastic reversal for the all-news
cable outlet. When CNN was first launched a decade ago, CBS
News crews were urged not to help any CNN crew, according to
several CBS News employees. But the situation has clearly
changed. Indeed, CBS Inc. executives, including Senior Vice
President Jay Kriegel and Broadcast Group President Howard
Stringer, held at least one meeting with Turner Broadcasting
executives in February about a possible partnership.
   Although those talks have yet to prove fruitful, there is
a possibility that CBS News and CNN might combine facilities
in locations such as South Africa and Berlin.
   The network news divisions are under enormous pressure
from their cooperate parents to trim costs. CBS News, for
instance, has an annual operating budget of about $300
million, but that includes the production of three prime-time
shows, including top rated "60 Minutes."
   Mr. Turner said domestically the networks rotate camera
crews on a weekly basis to cover press briefings given at the
Pentagon and State Department in Washington.
   Most recently, for example, the three networks and CNN
agreed to pool their election-polling units. "It would have
cost each network $12 million over four years to conduct exit
polls," said one official. "And for what? We all would have
gotten the same information."
   Now, the official said, the networks and CNN will split
the $12 million four ways. He added, "And, when we can, when
it doesn't compromise our broadcasts or affiliates, that's
what we'll do on foreign stories."
