   Shifting fashion currents are causing rough sailing for
Lands' End Inc. And that portends trouble for other apparel
retailers that also favor quality and value over style.
   The Dodgeville, Wis., catalog company cruised smoothly
through the 1980s, ringing up annual sales and profit gains
of over 40% by selling traditional threads such as khaki
pants and rugby shirts to a growing audience. Stressing
quality and value rather than fashion fads, it won loyal
customers by setting a new standard for service: Calls to its
phone centers are answered within 1.5 rings, merchandise is
almost always available and orders are usually shipped within
a day.

   But Lands' End has hit some snags. Although sales rose 20%
last year, costs climbed more sharply when fewer catalog
recipients than expected placed orders. Earnings fell 10%.
Now Lands' End is forecasting a profit plunge of as much as
66% in its first fiscal quarter ending Monday on sales "only
marginally better" than a year ago. Analysts, worried about
fat inventories, predict earnings for the current fiscal year
could decline 12% or more.
   The culprit: Tired merchandise. Fashion at the moment is
shifting toward softer, more stylish looks and bolder prints
than the typical tailored Lands' End fare, which was in vogue
in the '80s. Gap Inc. and Limited Inc., the shopping-mall
trendsetters, are filling their stores with the new threads.
And the Lands' End merchandise, much of which hasn't changed
at all in recent years, is starting to look dull and even
dowdy by comparison, say industry executives and analysts.
Lands' End acknowledges the problem and is introducing more
new products.
   Lands' End, of course, isn't the only catalog company
having problems these days. After growing rapidly for most of
the past decade, sales of apparel catalogs increased only
3.7% last year, according to MRCA Information Services, a
market research firm in Stamford, Conn. Competition from
department stores, which discounted heavily over the
Christmas season, may have been a factor.
   But companies catering to the traditional crowd have been
hit harder than their more style-conscious competitors. Sales
at L.L. Bean Inc., a closely held catalog company that also
sells classic casual threads, inched up a disappointing 3.4%
to $600 million in the fiscal year ended Feb. 25; the company
doesn't disclose profit.
   With Lands' End's annual sales now topping $545.2 million,
some experts say the two conservative clothing giants may
have saturated their market. "There's only so much sales
potential," contends Todd H. Barr, a direct-mail industry
consultant at Kurt Salmon Associates. "You've got a couple of
very large players in Lands' End and L.L. Bean that are both
trying to dip out of that bucket."
   The shopping malaise hasn't hurt J. Crew as much, even
though Crew says 65% of its customers also buy from Lands'
End. Sales of Crew's more stylish casual clothes rose 40% to
$150 million in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31. Sales growth
has since slowed to a rate 10% ahead of last year's.
   Other catalog houses that sell sexier or more
sophisticated clothes than Lands' End and Bean are doing
better, too. Net income rose 29% last year at Spiegel Inc.,
and the company reported a first-quarter profit increase of
23% Wednesday. Even its Eddie Bauer catalogs, which cater to
the traditional crowd, are doing well. Analysts and
competitors say that's because Bauer has been updating its
looks and adding more women's merchandise, much of which is
more fashionable than the typical Lands' End outfit.
   Ruth Rubinstein, a fashion sociologist at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in New York, sees a shift in consumer
attitude that bodes ill for Lands' End and other purveyors of
traditional clothes. Today, people are wrapping themselves in
softer, less-structured styles to demonstrate a willingness
to express their feelings and get involved in relationships,
she contends.
   "We are much more sensitive to style and to the message of
what clothing means," she insists. By contrast, wearing a
Lands' End outfit "suggests that ideas matter to you more
than appearances," says Ms. Rubinstein.
   Lands' End doesn't worry about such distinctions. "We're
not out to try to keep up with the current style. It's not
our thing," says a Lands' End spokesman. "We think our styles
are classic and traditional and timeless." Moreover, the
spokesman contends Lands' End can still grow with its
traditional lineup. "There's still a group who appreciate
classic styling, honest value, good quality and quick
service," he says. "The fact that we have added significantly
to our customer base over the last year is evidence that
there's continued growth."
   While attributing its problems partly to a slowdown in
consumer spending, Lands' End executives concede that they
may not have introduced enough fresh merchandise. Just 11.5%
of its catalog items last year and 8% the year before were
new. To attract more customers, Lands' End plans to increase
that percentage this year to between 15% and 18%, Richard
Anderson, chief executive officer, told analysts last week.
Mr. Anderson declined to be interviewed for this article.
   New products include sunglasses, children's swimsuits and
infants' clothing and bedding. Among the new styles are
two-piece women's bathing suits (but not skimpy bikinis),
tailored linen jackets for women and sweatsuits made from the
same hefty cotton fabric as Lands' End's rugby shirts. A
separate children's clothing catalog is planned for August.
And next year, Lands' End intends to mail a separate catalog
of bed and bath items.
   The company also is trying to present its merchandise in a
more exciting way. The May catalog, for instance, features
"Mom Packs" of complete outfits wrapped in gift boxes for
Mother's Day. One consists of a T-shirt and shorts. Another
features an all-cotton polo dress with a cotton scarf. The
June book, the spokesman adds, will highlight "a hit parade
of all-time best sellers."
   However, some analysts and industry executives contend the
changes at Lands' End aren't enough. "Lands' End's problem is
they've slowed down in terms of their imagination in product
development," contends Ted Pamperin, chairman of Tweeds Inc.,
a closely held catalog outfit that expects sales of its
casual European-style clothes to grow by about 60% this year.
"They're relying too much on what they've done before."
   "In any business, you can't keep showing the same thing
over and over," says Arnold Zetcher, president of Talbots,
which sells conservative women's clothing through catalogs
and stores. "We're constantly updating what we're showing."
   With its growth lagging many of its competitors, Lands'
End has little choice but to update its looks. But it also
must be careful not to alienate its conservative clientele.
In fact, none of the company's critics are contending that
Lands' End abandon its mission and start selling trendy items
like lingerie or body-hugging leggings.
   "The challenge is to refresh their offer and continue to
be exciting to the people to whom they appeal," says Mr.
Pamperin.
