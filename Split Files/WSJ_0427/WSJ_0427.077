   LOS ANGELES -- Animated-film festivals aren't Mickey Mouse
affairs for Terry Thoren. They're serious business.
   The 38-year-old animation enthusiast has built a
profitable company, Expanded Entertainment, by packaging
short animated films into feature-length motion pictures. No
mere cult product, Mr. Thoren's packages now play to sellout
crowds across the country.

   For example, "The Second Animation Celebration" has
grossed $2 million so far, and the 1989 work is still showing
in some cities. "We feel we can get up to $3 million or $4
million on a film," Mr. Thoren says. If that's peanuts by
Hollywood standards, it's more than enough to sustain a
15-person firm operated out of a converted garage.
   Mr. Thoren, a former theater manager and film student,
turned a once-obscure event for aficionados, the Tournee of
Animation, into a moneymaking product palatable to mainstream
moviegoers. His experience shows the opportunities in
applying business methods to ventures once driven mainly by
artistic sensibilities.
   The mostly avant-garde animated shorts featured in Mr.
Thoren's compilations aren't the child-oriented, Smurf-like
stuff seen on Saturday-morning television. Some, such as the
Academy Award-winning "Balance" -- a brooding commentary on
individual greed and group needs -- have dark themes and deep
political messages. Others are full of irreverent humor; for
instance, "A Warm Reception in L.A." plumbs an author's
frustrated dealings in Hollywood. Mr. Thoren calls the
compilations "sophisticated adult entertainment."
   Expanded's latest film, "The XXII International Tournee of
Animation," opens in 11 cities today, including New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Houston. The movie will run two
weeks, then move to other cities -- as many as 350 eventually
-- for limited engagements (usually two weeks). "We don't
play on an open-ended basis," Mr. Thoren explains. "We create
a sense of urgency so that people don't procrastinate and
miss the movie."
   The Tournees of Animation go back to 1966, when animators
Bill Littlejohn and Ward Kimball and producer Les Goldman
decided Los Angeles should have an annual animation festival
similar to the well-known Festival d'Annecy in France.
   The Tournees, originally designed to appeal primarily to
animators and fans of the art, were first shown at art
museums and on college campuses. In 1978, producer Prescott
Wright began showing them at "art-house" theaters owned by
Landmark Theatre Corp., Los Angeles.
   Mr. Thoren, then a film buyer for Landmark and later its
vice president of marketing, thought the Tournees could be
bigger moneymakers. In 1985, he bought production and
distribution rights to the festivals and formed Expanded. He
has financial backing from Landmark, which now is a unit of
Heritage Entertainment Inc.
   Almost immediately, Mr. Thoren pushed to expand
distribution of the Tournees. The 1986 Tournee, the first
produced by Expanded, was shown on 250 screens, up from 85
screens for the prior Tournee. Revenue jumped to $1 million
for the 1986 Tournee from $225,000 for the prior three
Tournees combined, Mr. Thoren says. If a city didn't have an
art house that would show the film, he rented an auditorium.
   Getting theaters to book the film was no easy feat. In New
York, Mr. Thoren had plenty of doors slammed in his face
before the Metro theater on the Upper West Side agreed to
show it. "They kept saying, `No way. We don't want animated
shorts]'" he recalls. That response from exhibitors prompted
Mr. Thoren and his crew to stamp 1,000 pairs of boxer shorts
with characters from the Tournee and mail them in film
canisters to journalists and others with notes reading,
"These aren't just animated shorts. . . ." (Mr. Thoren
mastered such circus-barker promotions when he was a theater
manager in Denver in the 1970s. He hawked a Bugs Bunny movie
by handing out carrots).
   In addition to increasing distribution, Mr. Thoren wanted
to make the Tournees seem more like feature films. He
upgraded prints to 35mm (from 16mm), made trailers and
printed up posters, fliers and other literature. "We used
traditional movie-marketing techniques," he says. "We treated
it like a roadshow rather than an elite art-show event."
   Since then, Expanded released several animation
anthologies in addition to the annual Tournees, including
"Animation Celebration," and a collection of short films by
the creator of the California Raisins, "Will Vinton's
Festival of Claymation." Half the profits from each Tournee
go to the animators whose works are featured. Mr. Thoren
hopes eventually to help animators produce their films,
rather than just compiling the finished products.
   Expanded also sponsors multiday animation-film festivals
every other year and publishes Animation Magazine, a
quarterly. The company has started releasing specialty
live-action feature films and hopes to produce a TV show.
   Still, Expanded has some stiff competition. San
Diego-based Mellow Manor Promotions Inc. produces the annual
"Festival of Animation," a similar compilation of animated
films that its associate producer, Shane Peterson, claims
attracts larger audiences per city (though the film shows in
fewer cities). "We're more event-oriented. We fly in
animators to the shows, and we're physically there at each
show, explaining to the audience what they're going to see,"
Mr. Peterson says.
   In addition to battling for audiences, Expanded and Mellow
Manor vie for animators, many of whom would never have their
works widely distributed were it not for these compilation
films. "I was courted, like many other animators, by both,
and I chose `The Festival of Animation' because I felt I
could get more publicity and exposure from them, and that's
really the name of the game," says animator Brett Thompson.
His six-minute cartoon "The Housekeeper" received plenty of
attention from movie and TV studios.
   Expanded had the winning hand as far as new talent this
year. "Balance," which won the Academy Award for best
animated short film, is featured in the latest Tournee. So is
"The Cow," which was a nominee for the award. Mr. Thoren
hand-carried "The Cow" here from the Soviet Union last year
because he didn't want to wait the year it would take to get
the film exported through bureaucratic channels.
   "We qualify films for the awards for animators all over
the world," says Mr. Thoren, whose search for new animated
works kept him traveling three months out of the past year.
   Christoff Lauenstein, a 25-year-old film student from West
Germany who made "Balance" with his twin brother, Wolfgang,
credits Mr. Thoren for getting their film qualified for the
Oscar with a special three-day screening at a Los Angeles
theater late last year. "We didn't think that a film like
ours had a possibility to run in America," Christoff
Lauenstein says. "We thought in America there were only
things like Disney."
