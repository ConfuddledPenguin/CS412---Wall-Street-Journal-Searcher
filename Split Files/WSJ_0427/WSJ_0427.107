   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund, frustrated
by repeated failures of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to
meet fund requirements, won't disburse $54 million in loans
earmarked for the financially troubled nation in central
Africa.
   Word of the IMF cutoff came this week as Mr. Mobutu, a
strong U.S. ally, moved to quell growing unrest in his nation
of 35 million people. Mr. Mobutu, a dictator widely accused
of plundering his country's wealth, said Tuesday that he was
lifting a longtime ban on opposition parties and that he will
set up a transitional government to rule until free elections
are held. For years, only one official party, Mr. Mobutu's
Popular Movement of the Revolution, has been allowed in
Zaire.

   The IMF action involves balance-of-payments loans that
would have been disbursed by June, had Zaire met budgetary
targets to which it agreed last year. Zaire's government
expenses -- especially spending by the presidential office of
Mr. Mobutu -- were "excessive," according to senior IMF
officials.
   The IMF is the second international financial institution
to put a hold on some of Zaire's aid. Earlier, the World Bank
decided to hold up $100 million in nonproject loans, to
pressure Mr. Mobutu to spend more money on programs for his
impoverished people and less on security, political
institutions and presidential perquisites.
   Both the World Bank and the IMF have been negotiating with
Zairean government officials since December. IMF officials
described the talks as "delicate" and said the fund isn't
close to resolving its differences with the government.
   "Zaire is a member country {of the IMF}, it has rights and
other obligations," a fund official said. "But we will not
twist the rules or procedures to accommodate Zaire."
   Under an arrangement Zaire reached with the IMF last June,
the country drew about $97.5 million in loans. But after IMF
officials determined that the government failed to meet
budgetary targets and other requirements, Zaire became
ineligible to draw down additional funds. The arrangement
expires this June, and it is unlikely that any of the
remaining $54 million will be disbursed, fund officials said.
   Under a second IMF program, Zaire received an additional
$113.5 million in loans last year.
   Despite his problems with the IMF and the World Bank, Mr.
Mobutu seems preoccupied with his political problems. His
critics in the U.S. Congress and his Zairean opponents
repeatedly have attacked him for mismanaging Zaire's economy
and for his government's sorry human rights record.
   Early this year, Mr. Mobutu sought public comment on his
rule. Many Zaireans bitterly criticized him and he responded
this week by announcing changes that he said would open up
Zaire's government to disparate voices. But he said he would
remain president "at the request of the people of Zaire."
