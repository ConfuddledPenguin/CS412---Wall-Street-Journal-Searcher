   When Samuel Belzberg started accumulating the stock of
Armstrong World Industries Inc. in October 1988, he never
dreamed of being stuck with a $31 million paper loss and a
messy proxy fight. But 18 months later, that's his
predicament.
   The stocky patriarch of one of Canada's wealthiest
families built his reputation as a corporate raider. He
acknowledges that much of the family fortune was accumulated
through a strategy that critics call "greenmail" -- acquiring
sizable stakes in U.S. companies, threatening a takeover and
then selling out at a premium to another bidder or the
frightened target itself. In 1986, the Belzbergs made about
$41 million from runs at Ashland Oil Inc. and USG Corp.

   But the 61-year-old Mr. Belzberg says that greenmail isn't
his family's style any longer. "Life changes," he said in a
rare interview, "and what's done at a certain time changes.
We're not going to do that anymore."
   The Belzbergs' latest corporate clash began last summer.
Holding a 9.85% stake in Armstrong through various companies,
including its flagship, First City Financial Corp., the
family said it might make a bid for the Lancaster, Pa.,
building products company -- or just sell its stock.
Armstrong said it wasn't interested in a takeover, and the
Belzbergs said they declined a buy-back offer from the
company, although no price was discussed.
   Now, with Armstrong's stock trading at about $6 a share
less than the Belzbergs paid for it, the usually private Mr.
Belzberg is waging a proxy fight at the Armstrong annual
meeting. On Monday, shareholders will consider the family's
nominees for four board seats. And they will vote on measures
that would remove some restrictions on mergers and make it
easier for shareholders to take action without management's
consent.
   To woo institutional investors, Mr. Belzberg has been
campaigning hurriedly this week, starting in California and
moving through the Midwest to New York. Although some
institutions suspect the family' motives in the proxy battle,
they do find some appeal in Mr. Belzberg's corporate
governance arguments and his board nominees.
   Furthermore, Armstrong's recent support of a strong
Pennsylvania anti-takeover bill, expected to be signed into
law today, may have undercut the company's cause with
institutional investors.
   "The Belzbergs are clearly interested in a takeover," said
Howard Sherman, director of the proxy analysis arm of
Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., which advises such
mammoth investors as New York City's public pension fund and
Fidelity Investments. "But we think the shocking behavior by
the Armstrong board with respect to pushing for this bill
really destroyed their credibility."
   When the Belzbergs began to take an interest in Armstrong,
it looked to them like a textbook takeover play. The buy-out
boom was in full swing then, and "Armstrong was on a lot of
people's lists," says Scott Robbins, vice president of First
City Capital Corp., a Belzberg merchant bank. Mr. Belzberg
says he first learned of Armstrong from a trolling investment
banker.
   But with Armstrong's management actively opposing a
takeover, slack demand for the company's durable goods, and a
devastated junk bond market, no bidders have emerged. Mr.
Belzberg himself says he can't find takeover financing on
terms that suit him, although he hopes a cash-rich strategic
buyer or co-buyer might yet appear.
   Without a buyer, Mr. Belzberg maintains that the best
long-term value for Armstrong's shareholders would come from
slashing overhead and selling off several businesses,
including furniture and insulation. Proceeds could be split,
he says, between dividends and reinvestment in the company's
flagship floor and ceiling divisions. "They're not doing a
bad job," says Mr. Belzberg. "But how many core businesses
can you have?"
   Armstrong executives declined requests to be interviewed
for this article.
   Winning the Armstrong proxy fight won't be easy for Mr.
Belzberg. First, there is the matter of the Belzberg
reputation, which Armstrong is reviewing in full-page
newspaper ads: Besides the family raider history, Armstrong
is reminding holders of a federal court ruling that Mr.
Belzberg's son, Marc, illegally "parked" stock with Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. in the family's run at Ashland Oil.
   Furthermore, Armstrong argues that the Belzbergs are
financiers, not industrialists. The company attacks the
Belzbergs' history of "management" of industrial companies:
the dismemberment of Scovill Inc., which the Belzbergs bought
in 1985, and the financial troubles of H.H. Robertson Co., a
target in which the family has a 25% stake and several board
seats.
   Mr. Belzberg estimates the proxy fight is costing him $3.5
million. Nevertheless, he hints that he may have to liquidate
his position and move on. "We've taken a loss before," he
says.
   And what of his next moves? "Sam has proven decade-in and
decade-out that he can adapt to changes," says Gerry
Schwartz, chief executive of Onex Corp., Canada's biggest
leveraged buy-out concern. "I expect he'll probably put more
emphasis on operating companies" instead of taking stock
positions.
   The Belzberg family's earliest investments were in Alberta
real estate. Sam and his two brothers, William and Hyman,
made their first fortunes speculating on property, eventually
creating a far-flung financial concern under the umbrella of
First City Financial.
   Mr. Belzberg says the real issue at stake in Monday's
proxy fight is management accountability to shareholders.
   "This management is basically looking for a way to protect
themselves," Mr. Belzberg says. "They're clouding the issue
because they don't want to say in the paper: `We're trying to
take your vote away and here's why.'"
   Specifically, Armstrong's shareholders cannot call special
meetings, act by nonunanimous written consent or directly
propose amendments to the company charter. Mr. Belzberg would
like to see those prohibitions overturned. He also wants to
elect four "independent" directors to the 14-member board to
better represent shareholder interests. (The vote on the
prohibitions will probably be non-binding, pending a federal
court ruling on their legality.)
   "Why should directors and management, unless they're
unsure about their abilities, try to insulate themselves from
shareholders?" he asks. After all, he says, he himself must
answer to First City's shareholders, particularly if
performance suffers. "My brothers might kick me out."
