   NEW YORK -- Image Bank Inc. expects to report fiscal
second-quarter earnings per share of one to five cents,
reflecting nonrecurring expense from both an industrywide,
sales-tax audit, and settlement of arbitration on the sale of
a business in 1984.
   For the quarter ended March 31, Image Bank, which licenses
stock photos, illustrations and film, expects to report net
income of between $35,000 and $185,000, Paul Eichler,
executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in
an interview. The nonrecurring expense totaled $250,000;
Image Bank is fighting California over some additional sales
tax the state collected, Mr. Eichler said.

   Year-earlier pro forma net income was $48,946, or two
cents a share; the net reflects a loss of three cents a share
from the discontinuation of the Art Kane Photographic
Workshop unit. Shares outstanding were 3.7 million in the
latest period and 2.2 million a year ago. Image Bank went
public last August.
   Revenue grew around 50%, to $12.5 million, from $8.3
million, Mr. Eichler estimated.
   For the six months, Image Bank expects to post net income
of between eight and 12 cents, or $300,000 to $450,000, from
the year-earlier pro forma $254,842, or 11 cents a share.
   These numbers reflect the company's recent restatement of
its first-quarter net downward to seven cents a share, from
12 cents, a move that knocked a third off the company's share
price. The company added $365,069 to cost of sales at the
Book People Ltd. subsidiary, acquired Oct. 1.
   Image Bank sees a "very strong second half," however, and
for all of fiscal 1990, it expects to exceed fiscal 1988's
earnings of $1.3 million, Mr. Eichler said. In fiscal 1989,
Image Bank earned $344,000.
   Representing some 450 photographers, 150 illustrators and
38 cinematographers, Image Bank operates a library of stock
photos, pictures and film. The company also has access to a
major part of the film library of Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. Image Bank has 51 offices world-wide, run mostly by
licensees.
   The artists give Image Bank the exclusive right to place
their works in its library. In turn, Image Bank licensees
sell rights to the works for use in magazine ads or "anything
that requires an image," Mr. Eichler said.
   Image Bank's licensees remit 60% of the proceeds of their
sales to the company. Image Bank then splits that amount
50-50 with the photographer, illustrator or cinematographer,
Mr. Eichler said.
   Though Image Bank's stock cinematography operation is
still unprofitable after two years, its growth prospects are
particularly strong, he said.
   Image Bank also publishes and markets photograph-oriented
"coffee-table" books, through operations including Book
People. Fiscal 1989 book operations, which didn't include
this unit, produced $4.7 million of revenue, a figure that
will "substantially more than double" in fiscal 1990, Mr.
Eichler said.
