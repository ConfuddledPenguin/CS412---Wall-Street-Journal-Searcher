   Chicago -- There are no posted directions to the weight
room in the field house at Sayre Park on this city's western
edge, but none are needed. A visitor follows his ears to the
basement, and turns right. Even when rubber collars are used,
400 pounds of iron plate makes quite a racket when dropped on
a wood platform atop a concrete floor. Bounces pretty high,
too.
   Downstairs, in a cinder-block room with peeling,
white-painted walls, Rich Shutz eyes a 462-pound load he has
affixed to a barbell. That's 22 pounds more than he has
lifted in competition. He breathes deep and hoists the weight
to his waist, then drops it with a crash. He does this twice
more before concluding the exercise.

   "Gotta get it to your waist before you can get it
overhead," explains Shutz, a pleasant, thick-bodied young man
of 24. "In weightlifting, you take things one step at a
time."
   The next step for Shutz may come at the National
Weightlifting Championships May 4-6 in Farmington Hills,
Mich. But then again, it may not. It's not so much a national
title that's in doubt for the Northeastern Illinois U.
senior, because he has won one annually since 1986. It's the
amount he lifts, and whether he can narrow the gap that
separates him from the East Europeans who populate the
activity's top echelon.
   Shutz is the U.S.'s best hope for eventual international
glory in the sport of heave and ho, but he has a way to go.
His position in the 110-kilogram (242-pound) weight class
keeps improving, from 15th place in the 1987 World
Championships, to 11th at the 1988 Olympics at Seoul, to
eighth in last year's World's in Athens, the highest U.S.
finish there. Yet the division winner at Athens, Bulgarian
Stefan Botev, hoisted 159.5 pounds more than Shutz's total of
781 for the snatch and clean-and-jerk, and the third-placer,
a Pole, topped his effort by 60 pounds.
   It long has been thus. The U.S. dominated weightlifting in
the immediate postwar years, producing strongmen such as Paul
Anderson, the Georgia giant who won 1956 Olympic gold, and
notable characters such as Harold Sakata, a 1948 silver
medalist who gained greater fame as the villain "Oddjob" in
the James Bond movie "Goldfinger." But then the East Bloc got
involved in earnest, and we Yanks have been out-yanked since.
   "We didn't keep up in terms of organization or financing,
and we're still far behind," says Roger Nielsen, the U.S.
national team coach who also oversees the Sayre Park
facility.
   Nielsen offers Sayre Park as an example of weightlifting's
beggarly status. The Chicago Park District provides the room,
but nothing more. Equipment is purchased with the $50-a-year
dues charged to lifters who use the place, plus receipts from
ticket and T-shirt sales at an annual meet. Neither the U.S.
Weightlifting Federation nor the U.S. Olympic Committee
provides operating support. Nielsen, an FBI agent, is unpaid
as a local or national coach.
   One might think that the recent national yen for health
through pumping iron would have aided the sport, but it
hasn't. "Health clubs don't like us," Nielsen notes. "Free
weights create litter, and the operators don't want us
banging 'em around."
   Weightlifting isn't easy to pursue on other grounds, the
coach continues. "It's difficult, there isn't much of an
audience, and most of the work has to be done alone," he
says. "We rarely get kids young enough to develop their
potential, and for every one who sticks we lose four or five,
usually to football. When you think about it, it's no
wonder."
   Given those circumstances, 6-foot-1 Shutz is a rare find
for the U.S. sport. He was initiated into it as a boy by his
father, Fred, a 1958 national champ, and decided early on
that he didn't like football. "Maybe it was because they
didn't let me play quarterback," he smiles. "In
weightlifting, everybody's a quarterback."
   But seriously folks, "I like the work, and every time you
lift, you compete against yourself. The challenge is always
there, even if no one is watching."
   In pursuit of that challenge, Shutz works out just about
every day, sometimes twice. In addition to his Sayre Park
sessions, he and his dad, who participates in master's
tournaments, share a workout shed in back of their home in
suburban Mount Prospect. Rich says their schedules rarely
permit them to practice together, but having a lifter father
still helps. "He understands what I do," says Rich. "Most
people don't."
   One thing most people don't understand is why he doesn't
have showy muscles like the bodybuilders, even though any
conceivable bully would make a wide detour to avoid
disturbing the sand around his beach blanket. "You lift
mainly with your thighs, butt and lower back," he explains.
"That's not the best for looking good in swimsuits."
   Another common misunderstanding concerns the skills needed
for Olympic type lifts in which the barbell must be raised
cleanly, and steadied overhead, to be counted. "It's not just
strength; there's footwork, agility and balance involved.
We've got things in common with dancers."
   Finally, weightlifting requires patience, necessitated by
the plateaus every lifter hits. Shutz is on one; his best
competitive total was the 797.5 pounds with which he won the
1988 U.S. Olympic Trials. Then torn shoulder cartilage set
him back, and so have the smaller ills all athletes incur
performing on the edge of their abilities. He says he's fit
now.
   Morever, Shutz thinks the world is turning in his
direction, especially the political changes in Eastern Europe
that might bring less regimentation -- and success -- to
those countries' athletic programs, and greater concern over
steroid use in weightlifting. He says he's never used the
drugs ("Sports aren't worth risking your health for"), and so
can only benefit from recent moves toward stricter testing.
   His goal is a 1992 Olympic medal, and he thinks a two-lift
total of between 870 and 880 pounds will win one for him.
Meantime, he'll settle for upping his personal best by 5 1/2
pounds next week. "Like I said, one step at a time," says he.
