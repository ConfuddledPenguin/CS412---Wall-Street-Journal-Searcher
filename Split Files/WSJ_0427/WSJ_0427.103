   NEW YORK -- The dollar eked out some gains against the
mark and yen, benefiting from a resurgence of unease over the
Germanys' monetary union and selling of the yen against the
mark late in the New York trading day.
   Traders said the U.S. currency was helped by development
of a "show-me" attitude toward the Bundesbank's stated
intention to keep the mark strong.

   "It will take more than talk {to preserve a strong mark}.
The Bundesbank needs to follow through, to do something,"
said Bob Hinton, a vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Savings
Bank in New York.
   In Frankfurt, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
the West German central bank "will do everything in its
power" to maintain the mark's stability, reaffirming what the
Bundesbank said Wednesday in its 1989 annual report.
   The market takes follow-through action to mean a rise in
West German interest rates, but as there probably won't be
any news on that until at least after Thursday's Bundesbank
Central Council meeting, there's no reason to sell the dollar
aggressively against the mark, Mr. Hinton said.
   Other participants doubted the Bundesbank would act
quickly to protect the mark. Any such action isn't likely to
come until after monetary union takes place July 2, the
traders said.
   The West German currency was also hurt a bit by concern
that the Bundesbank might go too far in raising interest
rates to protect the mark, damaging West German industry,
said Peter Iversen, a trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston.
   The U.S. unit received some support against the mark and
yen from a modest shift to long dollar positions ahead of the
scheduled announcement today of preliminary data expected to
show a healthy increase in U.S. gross national product for
the first quarter, said Hubert Pedroli, vice president and
manager of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6803 marks, up from 1.6785 marks late Wednesday, and at
159.23 yen, above 158.75 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6343, down from $1.6403 Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 159.25 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of
158.77 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6798
marks.
   The data are predicted by economists to show GNP at an
annual growth rate of 2.7%. GNP grew at an annual rate of
1.1% in the fourth quarter. Growth for 1989 as a whole was
2.2%.
   The yen declined again around midday in New York, when
traders reversed their previous sales of marks for yen.
   After falling to 94.44 yen late in the London day from
94.51 yen in Tokyo, the mark ended the New York day around
94.763 yen, above the Wednesday close in New York of 94.59
yen.
   Yen sales for marks and the Swiss franc, which Japanese
corporations continued to buy to pay for maturing Swiss
franc-denominated bonds, helped the dollar break 159 yen and
remain there in the second half of New York's day, traders
said.
   Aside from the Japanese purchases of Swiss francs that
have brought the currency new attention, the Swiss unit is
benefiting from the Swiss National Bank's successful effort
to convince the market that the bank is determined to do
whatever is necessary to keep the franc strong, said Credit
Suisse's Mr. Pedroli.
   The Swiss franc finished the New York day at 109.226 yen,
above 108.58 yen in Tokyo and 108.91 yen late Wednesday in
New York. The franc finished at 107.12 yen in Tokyo
Wednesday.
   In Europe, the dollar ended moderately lower against most
major currencies from its Wednesday closing levels.
   Dealers said the market was more than likely to wait for
the U.S. GNP data before committing aggressively in either
direction on the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar finished higher as dealings once
again focused on non-dollar trading. The dollar finished at
158.77 yen, below 159.25 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
   Many Japanese market participants are waiting for the end
of next week's holidays before taking any new positions
against the U.S. currency, according to dealers.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370.50 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $371.05 an ounce.
