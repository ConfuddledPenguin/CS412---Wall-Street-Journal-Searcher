   NEW YORK -- In a setback for the Commodity Exchange,
Arnold F. Staloff resigned as president and chief executive
officer after only nine months on the job.
   Mr. Staloff is one of the most well-regarded executives in
the futures and options industry. When he was plucked from
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in July to head the Comex,
the 45-year-old Mr. Staloff was heralded as someone who could
rejuvenate the languishing Comex by introducing new futures
and options products, his specialty.

   But in recent months, according to Comex traders and
others familiar with the situation, Mr. Staloff's relations
with Comex's trader leadership, including Chairman Martin
Greenberg, increasingly soured. "It was one thing after
another," said one person close to Mr. Staloff. Mr. Staloff
couldn't be reached to comment.
   Traders say Mr. Staloff's resignation stemmed from the
type of power play that has long been common at New York's
futures exchanges. The resignation consolidates the power of
Mr. Greenberg, who has held the chairmanship for just over a
month and is the president of Sterling Commodities Corp., a
futures brokerage firm. Mr. Greenberg has privately expressed
his displeasure with Mr. Staloff, several traders said. And
Mr. Staloff resigned under pressure, they said. Mr. Greenberg
declined to comment through a Comex spokesman. Mr. Staloff's
resignation is expected to be announced today.
   For years, the biggest problem at the Comex, the nation's
fourth-largest futures exchange and the biggest
precious-metals marketplace, has been its failure to develop
innovative futures products to match the big Chicago
exchanges.
   While the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange launched wildly successful
financial-futures contracts in the 1980s, such as stock-index
futures and Treasury-bond futures, the Comex hasn't had a
successful new product since gold futures were developed in
the 1970s.
   Mr. Staloff's departure casts a further cloud over the
future of the Comex. For several years the exchange has been
losing market share to the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
nation's leading oil-trading marketplace. With Mr. Staloff's
departure, the Comex faces a leadership vacuum. Since
mid-1989, the exchange has lost other key leaders, including
longtime chairman and president Alan Brody and his successor
as chairman, John Hanemann. Earlier this year, Mr. Hanemann's
successor, Robert Fink, declined to run for a second term.
   Mr. Staloff isn't the only recent departure at the Comex.
Arthur Kaufman, the head of marketing appointed by Mr.
Staloff, left the exchange several weeks ago after less than
six months on the job, according to exchange officials.
   Although it is the world's major gold, silver and copper
futures exchange, the Comex is a distant fourth in size
behind the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Merc and the
New York Merc. Among the failures in new products at the
Comex was last year's scuttling of plans to start a
diamond-futures contract. Some traders had thought Mr.
Staloff could turn the Comex's fortunes around.
   A 16-year veteran of the Philadelphia exchange, Mr.
Staloff created the first foreign-currency options and
developed the exchange's computerized trading system. His
reputation was so strong, in fact, that when he joined the
Comex, he was called "a financial sector all-star" by
then-chairman Mr. Hanemann.
   Comex traders and people close to Mr. Staloff said they
weren't shocked that Mr. Staloff didn't mesh with the trader
leaders at the Comex. He was apparently ill-prepared for the
exchange's politically charged atmosphere, a person close to
him said. In an interview shortly after his appointment, Mr.
Staloff said he disdained sniping. "I hate it when people
talk behind my back," he said.
   It's understood that Mr. Staloff is weighing several
options for a new job, but Philadelphia exchange officials
couldn't be reached for comment on whether they would offer
him a job.
   Mr. Staloff's resignation leaves James Goodwin second in
command after Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Goodwin, who has served as
the exchange's compliance officer, currently is an executive
vice president.
   It's unclear how Mr. Staloff's resignation will affect the
negotiations between the Comex and New York Merc for a
proposed merger. In January, the boards of the two exchanges
tentatively agreed on a merger plan, but discussions have
stalled recently, traders said.
   With trading volume sluggish, the price of a Comex seat
has slumped in recent weeks, falling 35% to $90,000.
