   POLHILL'S RELEASE fails to boost U.S. optimism about the
other hostages.
   Even if another captive is let go, U.S. officials say,
freedom for the rest remains a long shot. Though Iran's
Rafsanjani and Syria's Assad are apparently working to
release others, their control over events may be limited.
Officials insist the U.S hasn't pressed Israel and Kuwait to
free Shiites they hold, a major demand of the hostageholders.

   Meanwhile, Iranian hard-liners may actually have won new
power in return for Polhill's release. Revolutionary Guard
veterans gain top spots in Iran's navy, and America-hating
Mohtashemi, promoted to a top policy spot, publicly warns
against "any lenient line which would lead Iran toward
surrendering to the U.S."
   Israel appears to be offering to swap Shiite Sheik Obeid
for U.S. and Israeli hostages, but Jerusalem's political
paralysis could scotch the deal.
                                                                                                       

   EXPORT CONTROLS on Western technology loosen as the Soviet
bloc crumbles.
   European realignment weakens the once-dominant U.S. role
in Cocom, the body that coordinates the West's export-control
policies. Bush aides acknowledge that Germany is the new
force in Cocom. And the Germans' desire to greatly liberalize
trade with the East causes U.S. concern.
   Pentagon chief Cheney argues that relaxing Cocom controls
too soon could play into the hands of a Soviet Union whose
appetite for stolen Western technology isn't sated. But even
he knows he may be fighting a losing battle. The Pentagon is
toning down opposition to exports of certain mainframe and
portable computers, and machine tools.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS POSITION themselves for possible White House
budget negotiations.
   Many view the House package that is likely to pass next
week as a bargaining ploy, not a realistic plan. Some
conservatives grudgingly accept budget chairman Panetta's
argument that his plan for $11.5 billion in defense cuts and
increased domestic spending will strengthen the House
position should there be a budget summit. Still, the vote
could be close.
   House tax writers say they won't begin looking for the
$13.9 billion in added taxes the plan calls for until there
is a deal with Bush. In the Senate, meanwhile, the Budget
Committee flounders as chairman Sasser fails to forge a
Democratic consensus on defense cuts.
   But GOP Sen. Grassley hints he may break party ranks and
provide a key vote for Sasser's $15 billion proposal.
                                                                                                       

   FORMER KKK LEADER David Duke, running as a Republican
against Louisiana Democratic Sen. Johnston, raised $455,000
-- mostly in bits of $200 or less -- during the first three
months of 1990. But Duke's racial and ethnic views are also
providing Johnston with fund-raising fodder; he has retained
a direct-mail firm experienced in wooing Jewish donors.
                                                                                                       

   HOT SEAT? Pentagon aide Craig Fields's abrupt demotion
leaves other officials who advocate an activist federal
industrial policy in an exposed position. The most
vulnerable: Deputy Commerce Secretary Thomas Murrin.
Presidential science adviser Allan Bromley is said to have
similar views, but his personal ties to Bush may protect him.
                                                                                                       

   LAWMAKERS BEGIN taking testimony Monday from Dubois
Gilliam, a former aide to ex-HUD Secretary Pierce. Gilliam,
convicted in the housing scandal, is expected to provide new
information on Pierce's role, and to tell how the Reagan
White House manipulated urban grants for political friends.
He is expected to focus on Pierce aides Lance Wilson and
Deborah Gore Dean.
                                                                                                       

   SHORTFALL: The junk-bond market claims another victim: the
Justice Department's plan to add antitrust regulators after a
decade of staff reductions. Congress cut the agency's budget
for this year, assuming that new pre-merger filing fees would
provide $20 million. But with the slowdown in activity, the
department now expects just $13 million to $15 million -- and
its hiring plans are on hold.
                                                                                                       

   STATES EXPAND health programs while the federal government
stalls.
   Massachusetts and Hawaii have enacted universal care for
the uninsured, and Washington is experimenting with a pilot
project. About a dozen states -- including Michigan, New
York, New Jersey, Minnesota and Vermont -- have adopted or
are considering significantly broader coverage than Medicaid
requires for women and children.
   Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and
Wisconsin take the lead in long-term care while looking for
ways to control costs. One model lumps Medicaid funds and
social and community service block grants together to provide
better home care.
   State pressure for federal action will increase:
Washington's Gardner plans to focus on health when he takes
over the National Governors Association in July.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: A bumper sticker in Madison, Wis., reads:
"Abortion? Pick On Somebody Your Own Size." . . . Ohio Rep.
Kasich describes his plan to hold most spending at this
year's levels but allow Medicare and Social Security to grow
as "a Dairy Queen freeze, a soft freeze." . . . The National
Institute on Aging labels a new program "Frailty and
Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques" --
FICSIT for short.
