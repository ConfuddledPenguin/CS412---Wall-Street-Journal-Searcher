   CHICAGO -- Marshall Field's top two executives said they
will leave the department store chain after it is acquired by
Dayton Hudson Corp.
   "The responsibility is so changed that I don't feel I
could be effective," Philip B. Miller, Field's chairman and
chief executive officer, said at a news conference. Mr.
Miller led an unsuccessful management bid to buy Field's.

   Field's said the chain's 56-year-old president and chief
operating officer, Burnett W. Donoho, will quit too. Mr.
Donoho wasn't at the news conference.
   Dayton Hudson, which agreed to buy Field's from B.A.T
Industries PLC for $1.04 billion last week, has said it plans
to merge most of Field's central office operations into its
department-store unit in Minneapolis. Mr. Miller said about
1,450 of the 1,700 Field's central office jobs will be
eliminated, including the entire merchandise buying, store
planning and financial operations. He said Dayton Hudson
plans to keep credit operations, special events and public
relations staffers in Chicago.
   Sporting the white carnation and green badge that all
Field's managers wear, the 51-year-old Mr. Miller said he has
no plans at the moment, but will probably stay in retailing.
