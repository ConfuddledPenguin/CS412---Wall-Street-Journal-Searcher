   Xerox Corp. posted a bigger-than-expected first-quarter
loss of $254 million, including a one-time charge of $375
million, reflecting a rapid deterioration in the company's
financial-services business.
   One analyst called the business's performance
"disastrous." But the loss also masked solid results from the
company's core business equipment operation, which had a 20%
profit gain.

   The Stamford, Conn., company's loss compared with profit
of $158 million in the year-ago period. The loss was $2.93 a
share, compared with profit of $1.47 a share. Revenue grew
2.8% to $4.26 billion from $4.14 billion.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Xerox dropped $1.25 to close at $51.
   The one-time charge, disclosed April 3, was related to the
company's abandonment of its investments in VMS Realty
Partners, a Chicago real estate concern. The previous day,
Vice Chairman Melvin Howard, who heads Xerox Financial
Services, had said he would take early retirement May 1.
Industry watchers said both moves signaled Xerox's growing
impatience with costly attempts to diversify away from its
strength in copiers and other office machines.
   Analysts said that the latest dismal showing by financial
services -- revenue sagged 5%, and profit plummeted 84% from
$67 million to $11 million, on woeful results from insurer
Crum &amp; Forster Inc. -- should strengthen Xerox's resolve to
deemphasize this area.
   "My guess is that we've already seen the first in a series
of steps," said Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., noting that Crum &amp; Forster stopped writing personal
lines of insurance this past week. "Allaire has given
marching orders to put a tourniquet on the cash flow going
into financial services," he said, referring to Paul Allaire,
Xerox president, who will become chief executive officer Aug.
1.
   On a brighter note, analysts praised gains in cost
control, rental and service revenue on the business equipment
side, though the analysts tagged copier sales as weak. "But
in document processing, at least, things are going reasonably
well," said Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Still, he and other analysts spent yesterday figuring out
new estimates of Xerox's 1990 earnings. Not counting the
$3.99-a-share charge, most guesses had hovered from $6 to
$6.50 a share. The consensus is now likely to settle well
below $6.
