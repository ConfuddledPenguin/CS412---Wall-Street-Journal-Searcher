   Ames Department Stores Inc., its dream of becoming one of
the nation's biggest discount retailers shattered by an
ill-fated acquisition, filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The filing in bankruptcy court in New York came as
negotiations with its lenders stalled and as shelves at
Ames's 680 stores were becoming barren as many vendors
stopped delivering new merchandise because they hadn't been
paid for past shipments.

   Hoping to restore confidence among suppliers, Ames said
Chemical Bank of New York has agreed to provide the company
$250 million in financing, pending bankruptcy court approval,
that could be used to pay for new merchandise.
   Ames, after contacting a number of large vendors,
expressed confidence that shipments would soon be resumed.
But some merchants indicated they still haven't decided
whether to resume shipments.
   Ames's bankruptcy-court filing is the latest sign of
trouble in the retailing industry. The Allied and Federated
store units of Campeau Corp. filed for Chapter 11 protection
in January, and last summer the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman
units of Sydney, Australia-based Hooker Corp. also filed for
bankruptcy protection. B. Altman has since been liquidated,
as has most of Bonwit Teller.
   Unlike those retailers, whose problems were largely
related to leverage, Ames's troubles stem from both the
mismanagement of the Zayre discount chain it acquired two
years ago and the debt it took on to help finance the
purchase.
   Ames bought the Zayre stores for almost $800 million in
the belief it could turn around the ailing chain. Instead,
problems at the Zayre stores pulled down Ames.
   "Ames stumbled because management didn't run the Zayre
stores properly," said Peter J. Solomon, who operates his own
investment banking firm in New York. "After Ames bought the
Zayre chain, management changed the inventory, the pricing,
and alienated the customers." Mr. Solomon added, however,
that other discounters also believed that rapid expansion was
the only way to successfully compete against K mart and
Wal-Mart.
   Some believe that Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., may
have to liquidate its unprofitable Zayre stores as part of
any reorganization plan. The former Zayre stores were the
major factor in the $228 million loss the company said it
expects to report for the year ended Jan. 27. The losses
caused a cash squeeze that resulted in vendors not being paid
and raised questions about Ames's ability to make debt
payments.
   "They will have to scale back the size of their
operations," said Craig Davis, director of research at R.D.
Smith &amp; Co., an investment firm that specializes in
bankruptcies and restructuring. "The core Ames business was a
fairly stable franchise and I think a move to scale back is
likely and positive for the long term."
   In its filing, the Northeast discount chain listed $1.67
billion in assets and $1.44 billion in liabilities. Among
vendors listed as Ames's largest unsecured creditors are:
   Societe General Financial Corp., $14 million; Gitano Group
Inc., a New York manufacturer of women's and men's apparel,
which is owed $5.3 million. It said it will take a charge of
about 10 cents a share for its first quarter in connection
with Ames; Rubbermaid Inc., owed $4.5 million; Sara Lee
Corp., $3.9 million; J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., $3.2 million; and
Quaker Oats Co.'s Fisher Price unit, $2.9 million.
   In addition, Beeba's Creations Inc., a San Diego importer
and wholesale distributor of women's clothing, said it will
take a charge of $740,000 in its third quarter ending May 31
as a result of writing off its Ames receivables of
$1,250,000. Beeba's added that it has about $1.5 million of
orders from Ames and that it expects to be able to resell the
merchandise if it is unable to establish acceptable payment
terms with Ames.
   In filing for bankruptcy-court protection, Ames hopes to
get sufficient merchandise back in its stores to improve its
core business. Ames executives, who reportedly have been
avoiding creditors for weeks, called about 150 of their
biggest vendors assuring them of payment for new shipments.
The remaining 5,000 vendors are being reached by mail.
   "We're encouraged by their response," said Douglas Ewing,
vice president, investor relations, for Ames, adding that 98%
of the largest vendors reached said they would resume
shipments. "Vendors might be wounded at heart but cash is a
great healer," said Mark Matheson, director of research at
Cruttenden &amp; Co., Newport Beach, Calif., which follows Ames's
manufacturer market.
   Ames has about $125 million in cash, and analysts have
estimated that it could raise another $75 million to $100
million by liquidating the inventory at 74 unprofitable
stores that it plans to close.
   Some shippers, however, remain nervous. Despite Ames's
reassurance of its extra cash supply, at least one key
factoring company said that it won't allow its apparel
clients to ship new merchandise to the troubled chain.
"Before we give the green light, we want to understand which
assets are free and clear," said this credit executive, who
asked not to be identified. "There is talk about a prior bank
loan being collateralized in some way."
   Indeed, Ames, which grew with its Zayre acquisition to
become the fourth-largest discount retailer with more than $5
billion in annual sales from $2.1 billion previously, will
have an uphill struggle. The discount market is among the
hardest hit segment of the sagging economy in the Northeast.
   While trying to mend relations with vendors, Ames also is
fighting time. "The next few months are vital shipping months
with summer and back-to-school {buying}," said Richard
Mercier, retail analyst for Moody's Investor Service Inc.
Moreover, competition is increasing as discount giant
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. moves into the Northeast.
   The company must refocus on what made it successful before
the Zayre purchase, retailing experts said. "What Ames must
now do is take a strong look at who their customer is today
-- I don't really think they know -- and to build from
there," said Rohit Deshpande, marketing professor at the Amos
Tuck Graduate School of Business at Dartmouth College.
   Ames, whose chief executive officer, Peter Hollis, had
earlier worked for Zayre, "thought it was buying an ailing
patient when in reality it had bought a cadaver," said Howard
Davidowitz, a retail consultant. It then proceeded to try to
incorporate Zayre into Ames's "every day low price" marketing
strategy. But that confused Zayre consumers, who were
attracted by sales and went elsewhere when Zayre stopped
advertising them.
   Getting rid of the Zayre stores, generally located in
metropolitan areas, would enable Ames to return to its roots
in small towns. "Wal-Mart won't tread into the smaller
markets and Ames can operate there safely with much success,"
said Mr. Davidowitz. "It was the big city urban environment
that was the company's downfall."
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ames shares
closed at $1.625, up 12.5 cents, on volume of 1.2 million
shares.
   The Chapter 11 filing immediately prompted both Moody's
and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to lower their ratings on Ames's
debt.
   Moody's lowered its ratings on about $354 million of the
company's long-term debt. Ratings downgraded were Ames's
sinking fund debentures to CA from single-B-3 and its senior
subordinated reset notes and its convertible subordinated
debentures to Ca from Caa.
   S&amp;P cut its ratings on Ames subordinated debt to D from
triple-C-plus, affecting about $355 million of Ames
securities.
