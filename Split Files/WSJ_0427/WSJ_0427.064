   BERN, Switzerland -- The government is formulating a
package of measures to supplement new laws that make
laundering money a crime.
   Lutz Krauskopf, vice director of the federal office of
justice, said that the additional measures could be prepared
as a draft proposal for the federal council, or executive
branch of government, to consider in May. By year end,
legislation could be submitted to parliament.
