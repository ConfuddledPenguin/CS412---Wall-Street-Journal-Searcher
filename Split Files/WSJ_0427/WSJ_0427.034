   WACO, Texas -- ASK Corp. said that it reached an agreement
with Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co. covering the
world-wide sales of ASK's products and technology.
   An ASK spokesman wouldn't disclose the value of the
agreement, but said it was a significant one for the company.
The agreement calls for an initial marketing program in the
U.S. and Japan. If successful, ASK said, it would then be
introduced in other world markets.
