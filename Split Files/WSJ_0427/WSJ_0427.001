   In his March 19 Manager's Journal, "In Information
Technology, the Key Is Good Relationships," Michael Schrage
belittles the so-called "apostles of the Information
Revolution" and dismisses the idea that information is a
strategic asset. Instead, he suggests that "relationships,"
both within a company and between a company and its clients,
are what really matter.
   He is right on that count, but he demonstrates a lack of
understanding of what the Information Revolution is all
about: using technology to exploit information for a whole
host of reasons -- strategic planning, corporate
intelligence, improving management and production, better
integrating functions within the company, projecting the
company's image, and, of course, improving internal
communications and client services (read "relationships").

   On the other hand, when Mr. Schrage slams CIOs (chief
information officers), he unwittingly hits the nail on the
head. Today, most CIOs do not manage information; they manage
information technology -- hardware, networks, integration and
so on. In fact, most CIOs are nothing more than glorified
(and well-paid) technicians. They lay the roadwork, direct
the traffic and do repair work. As long as information makes
it to its final destination, the CIO has succeeded. That's
the problem.
   Information is a strategic asset only when it is properly
exploited. Getting tailored information to the right people
is a technical problem; using that information is a strategic
problem. A company's CIO, then, ought to be the company's top
strategic planner, someone who understands the value of
critical information and how to exploit information
technology for the benefit of the company -- to beat the
competition, to increase the efficiency of company operations
(and raise profits), and, yes, to improve the "relationships"
inside the company and with its clients.

   The relationships between individuals within
organizations, specifically people responsible for providing
information, are critical to management. These individuals
are oftentimes referred to as "information providers." A
relatively new technology has been emerging over the past
several years called executive information systems, which
provide executives (I define executives as Peter Drucker
does, as "knowledge based workers") with information from
which they might better manage an organization.
   The concept of executive information systems is not new.
In fact, the idea of providing information for high-level
individuals within an organization is as old as information
technology itself. It's a good idea. Unfortunately, it has
previously failed for various reasons, not the least of which
was a lack of attention paid to the relationships mentioned
in Mr. Schrage's article. Not considering the roles that
information providers play in the political environment
within an organization does a disservice not only to the
organization and these providers but to information
technology as well. Without interaction between executives
and information providers, management expectations go
unchecked, and the information system does not contain the
information the executive needs.
   But if the relationships between people are incorporated
into an organization's technology plan, then an executive
information system can encourage productive interaction. By
giving executives access to internal and external data of
almost any kind, executives and providers are both focused on
the same information and can spend more time solving problems
rather than trying to locate them. Executive information
system technology provides a means for information providers
and executives to communicate in a way that does not inhibit
those who are computer literate or savvy, nor does it
preclude those who have no computer expertise from
participating.
