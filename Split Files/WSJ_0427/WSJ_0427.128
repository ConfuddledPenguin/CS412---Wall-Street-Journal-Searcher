   THE U.S. AND SOVIETS REACHED an accord to normalize trade
relations.
   For the first time in half a century, Washington and
Moscow agreed to a trade pact that would offer the Soviet
Union most-favored-nation status, meaning that its goods
could enter the U.S. at the lowest tariff rates, a senior
U.S. negotiator announced. The accord requires congressional
approval. A Bush administration official recently said that
superpower trade soon could total as much as $15 billion a
year, compared with between $1 billion to $3 billion in
recent years.

over a Kremlin crackdown on Lithuania, but Bush this week
deferred any curbs on Moscow.

   CHENEY PROPOSED reductions in Pentagon plans for the
Stealth bomber.
   In a major concession to congressional budget-cutters, the
defense secretary called for building only 75 of the 132 B-2
Stealth bombers envisioned by the Defense Department, and he
urged significant cuts in two other aircraft projects.
Intended to save $35 billion over the next eight years,
Cheney's recommendations would involve cutting 90 aircraft
from the Air Force's planned 210plane fleet of C-17 troop
transports. He also proposed stretching out development of
new jet fighters.
   Rowny quit as a senior arms adviser to Bush over what
sources said he felt was undue haste in completing a
superpower pact on long-range weapons.

   Shamir was chosen by Israeli President Herzog to form a

exist unless election laws are changed.
