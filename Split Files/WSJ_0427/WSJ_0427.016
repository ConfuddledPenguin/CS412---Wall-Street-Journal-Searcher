   STOCKHOLM -- Swedish investors set records buying foreign
shares in March, while foreigners remained net sellers of
Swedish shares.
   The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said Swedes bought
10.58 billion kronor of shares ($1.72 billion) in March, up
from 3.89 billion kronor in February and from two billion
kronor in March the previous year.

   Purchases of foreign shares have soared since the Riksbank
in January 1989 removed restrictions on foreign buys as part
of the deregulation of foreign controls. The March figure was
the highest registered so far in a single month.
