   Georgia's process for electing superior court judges was
called racist by the U.S. Justice Department.
   The far-reaching decision by the department's civil rights
division could thrust Georgia's courts into turmoil,
according to both sides in a lawsuit. The ruling covers 58 of
the state's 135 superior court judgeships in 30 of 45
judicial circuits.

   Unless the matter is dealt with through a special
legislative session changing election laws or is resolved
through settlement or a legal challenge, no elections for
those posts can be held and the judgeships would cease to
exist when the judges' current terms expire at the end of
1990 and 1992.
   "It's a landmark, historic decision," said Tyrone Brooks,
a Georgia state legislator and lead plaintiff in a federal
suit filed against the state in Brunswick, Ga., in 1988 with
the aid of the American Civil Liberities Union. "The judicial
branch is in for a change."
   Michael J. Bowers, Georgia's attorney general, called the
ruling "a setback." He said he will keep trying to settle the
case while continuing a legal fight.
   In a letter, John R. Dunne, the new assistant attorney
general for the civil rights division, told Mr. Bowers that
the state's manner of electing judges was designed
deliberately to discriminate against blacks. In his first
major decision since taking office April 2, Mr. Dunne said
black voting power is diluted by Georgia's combined use of
at-large circuit elections and a requirement that judicial
candidates win by a majority.
   In at-large districts, which generally cover a wide
geographic area, voters select more than one judge for the
region. Such elections can dilute a voting group's power if
that group is a minority within the circuit. In contrast,
single-judge districts give neighborhoods sole power to
select the judge for that district.
   The ruling doesn't address remedies for the problem. Only
five of the state's 135 judges are black. No black has ever
defeated a white incumbent judge, the ruling said.
   Under Section Five of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 18
states with a history of voting-rights violations --
including Georgia -- must submit changes in laws governing
elections to the civil rights division for prior approval to
ensure that the changes do not discriminate. The Justice
Department previously raised objections to the methods of
electing judges in Louisiana, Mississippi and North Carolina.
   The suit charged that Georgia didn't obtain the
department's clearance on certain judicial posts and attacked
the manner of electing judges. A special three-judge federal
district court panel in Brunswick ruled last December that
the state had to submit information on the judges to the
agency.
   Mr. Bowers could seek a hearing before the U.S. District
Court in Washington, D.C., or seek review of the Brunswick
court's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

   AMERICA'S CUP victory by San Diego is upheld by New York's
highest court.
   The decision is the final word in the contentious dispute
between the San Diego Yacht Club and the Mercury Bay Boating
Club of New Zealand. The New Zealand challenger had claimed
that San Diego violated the spirit of the 132-year-old
international contest by using a catamaran to defeat New
Zealand's 90-foot monohull in 1988. Mercury Bay claimed that
the rules required San Diego to use a boat similar in size to
the challenger's.
   The New York Court of Appeals in Albany ruled that while
San Diego's use of the catamaran might not have been fair, it
wasn't illegal. In a 5-2 decision, the judges said the courts
aren't the proper forum for determining the fairness of a
sport.
   "The question of whether particular conduct is `sporting'
or `fair' in the context of a particular sporting event . . .
is wholly distinct from the question of whether it is legal,"
wrote Judge Fritz Alexander II in the majority opinion.
"Questions of sportsmanship and `fairness' with respect to
sporting contests depend largely upon the rules of the
particular sport and the expertise of those knowledgeable in
that sport; they are not questions suitable for judicial
resolution."
   The court said that nowhere in the rules governing the
contest is the defending yacht club required to race a vessel
similar to the challenger's entry. The America's Cup is
governed by New York state law because it was formed by the
New York Yacht Club.
   Andrew Johns, an attorney for the New Zealand club in
Auckland, said Mercury Bay accepts the court's decision as
final and is preparing for the next race, expected to be in
1992. "It's all systems go. We're back to an on-the-water
campaign," he said. But he added that the court's
interpretation of the rules gives an unfair advantage to the
defender. "What the majority has said is `anything goes.'
There is no restriction on the defender on length or any of
the other factors that the challenger must give notice of,"
Mr. Johns said.
   Harold R. Tyler Jr., an attorney for the San Diego club,
said Mercury Bay's own interpretation of the rules would have
put the defender at a disadvantage. Because the race has to
be held 10 months after the challenge is made, the San Diego
club wouldn't have had enough time to construct a 90-foot
monohull to match New Zealand's entry, he said.
   "Fairness is a slippery concept," Mr. Tyler said. "It's
sort of like beauty -- it's all in the eye of the beholder."
   Both Mr. Tyler and Mr. Johns said that an agreement
reached by many yacht clubs in 1988 will probably prevent
similar disputes from occurring again. The lawyers said the
case may also lead to changes clarifying the rules of the
competition.

   BOESKY'S TAX RETURNS won't be made available for
Mulheren's defense.
   A federal judge ruled that lawyers for John Mulheren are
not entitled to receive copies of Mr. Boesky's tax returns
and the financial and bank statements of Ivan Boesky and his
family.
   At the urging of lawyers for Mr. Boesky and prosecutors in
the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge
Miriam Cedarbaum rejected a subpoena submitted by lawyers for
Mr. Mulheren seeking the documents. Mr. Mulheren, once one of
the nation's most powerful arbitragers, is scheduled to go on
trial on May 14. A federal grand jury indicted Mr. Mulheren
last June on 42 counts of securities fraud, mail fraud,
conspiracy and record-keeping violations.
   Mr. Mulheren was accused of "parking" stock with Mr.
Boesky, the convicted former takeover speculator. Parking
occurs when an investor sells securities with the
understanding that they will be repurchased, usually at a
prearranged time and price. The government said Mr. Mulheren
used the tactic to conceal the true ownership of the parked
securities. Mr. Mulheren has pleaded innocent to the charges.
   Thomas Puccio, the New York attorney who is representing
Mr. Mulheren, said he was seeking Mr. Boesky's personal
income tax returns for the years 1983 through 1987 and his
bank and other financial records for 1985 through the present
to show that Mr. Boesky wasn't left broke, as his lawyers
suggested, after he agreed to pay $100 million in fines to
settle insider trading charges against him in 1987.
   Mr. Puccio said that Mr. Boesky got a "sweetheart deal"
from the government and had "many millions more than he told
the government." Mr. Puccio said that as a witness against
Mr. Mulheren, Mr. Boesky will be "biased in favor of the
government" because the "government allowed Mr. Boesky to
hold on to many millions of dollars" after he paid the fine.
   Mr. Puccio's argument in court yesterday presages what is
likely to be the mainstay of the defense in the case against
Mr. Mulheren. Mr. Puccio will try to impeach the credibility
of Mr. Boesky, the government's main witness in the case, by
attacking his finances and asserting that he lied about his
dealings with Mr. Mulheren, among others, to reduce his
prison term. Mr. Boesky recently completed a three-year
prison sentence.
   Assistant U.S. attorney Scott Gilbert and Charles Davidow,
a lawyer for Mr. Boesky, argued that Mr. Puccio is trying to
embark on a "fishing expedition," and that the government's
1986 plea bargain agreement with Mr. Boesky did not require
that he give up all of his money.
   "I really am not satisfied that this subpoena is not
fishing and is material" to the case against Mr. Mulheren,
Judge Cedarbaum said. Mr. Puccio said he would submit another
subpoena requesting more specific information about Mr.
Boesky's finances.

   KENTUCKY NEWSPAPER loses key appeals court ruling in libel
case.
   In a unanimous decision, the Kentucky Supreme Court
ordered that a new trial be held in a libel case against the
Lexington Herald-Leader by a former University of Pittsburgh
assistant basketball coach.
   The ex-coach, Reggie Warford, sued the Knight-Ridder Inc.
newspaper over a two-part series published in 1985 on
corruption in college basketball. The Pulitzer Prize-winning
articles alleged that Mr. Warford violated recruiting rules
by offering money to a Kentucky high school basketball star.
   The trial judge dismissed the case at the conclusion of
the evidence on the grounds that Mr. Warford was a public
figure and had failed to meet the public-figure standard of
proving reckless disregard for the truth.
   The state supreme court, however, disagreed on both
counts. It said Mr. Warford "did not assume the risk of
public scrutiny" as a coach and therefore was not a public
figure and did not have to comply with the stringent
reckless-disregard standard. In addition, the court ruled,
there was sufficient evidence presented in the case to allow
a jury to find reckless disregard.
   The suit stemmed not from the actual publication of the
articles but from their reprint in a special tabloid the
newpaper distributed nationwide to colleges and the press.
Mr. Warford, who lost his job in 1986 after the hiring of a
new head coach, claims that the reprinted articles prevented
him finding other coaching positions.
   The Herald-Leader says it will seek a review of the
appeals court decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   "Beyond our own institutional interest, we're concerned
about {the decision's} effect on free speech and free press
in Kentucky," said John S. Carroll, the paper's editor.
