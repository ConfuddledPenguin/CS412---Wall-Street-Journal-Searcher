   TOKYO -- Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses in the
year ended March 31 fell 6% to 5.8 million units from 6.2
million a year earlier, marking the fourth consecutive
fiscal-year decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association said.
   But in March, exports rose for the first time since
August, increasing 0.8% to 551,997 units from 547,798 a year
earlier, when the year-to-year rise was 18.5%. Except for
August, vehicle exports had been declining every month from
year-earlier levels since March 1989. The association said
the general trend of fewer exports remains the same.

   Japanese auto makers are continuing to meet overseas
demand by producing at local facilities, particularly in the
U.S. and Europe, which has caused Japanese exports to
dwindle.
