   HOUSTON -- Compaq Computer Corp.'s first-quarter earnings
exceeded most analysts' forecasts due to increased domestic
market share and unexpectedly strong European sales.
   The Houston-based computer maker said it had net income of
$92.2 million, or $2.13 a share, up 11% from $83.2 million,
or $1.95 a share. Sales surged 28% to $872.2 million from
$682.9 million.

   Compaq's stock reacted favorably to the earnings
announcement, closing yesterday in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange at $98.25 a share, up $4.25.
   Compaq had warned analysts in late February that its share
of the market for high-end personal computers was eroding,
leading to projections of little if any earnings increase in
the first quarter. Most estimates ranged between $1.75 and
$2.11 a share.
   But a 56% increase in overseas sales exceeded company
expectations, said Michael Swavely, Compaq president of North
American operations. And North American sales increased 4%
despite a stagnant market, indicating increased market share.
   Mr. Swavely also said Compaq had preserved its 40% gross
margin, reflecting strong demand for products introduced
within the past six months, including a fileserver that can
link several dozen personal computers.
   Despite a flat first quarter for the industry, Compaq is
holding to its prediction that the U.S. market will grow by
5% to 10% in 1990. Fueling such growth, said Mr. Swavely,
will be new software applications that may be introduced as
soon as May. "That, I believe, will renew general excitement
among all customers," he said, and will in turn lead to "a
very aggressive new product year for Compaq."
