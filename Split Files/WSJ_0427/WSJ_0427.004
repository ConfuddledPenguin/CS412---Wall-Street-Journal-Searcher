   Want to double your retirement dollars by age 65?
   That may sound like a come-on for a classic investment
scam, but it's something many employees can achieve -- if
they make smart choices now with their profit-sharing, 401(k)
and other tax-deferred savings plans at work.
   Too often, financial advisers say, people fail to achieve
the full potential of their company retirement plans because
they make some fundamental mistakes. Top of the list:
treating "these plans like savings accounts, not investment
vehicles," says Charles Salisbury at T. Rowe Price
Associates.
   Typically, employees can allocate the money in 401(k) and
profit-sharing plans among at least three types of
investments, including a stock mutual fund, their own
companies' stock and fixed-income investments. But they
usually place most -- if not all -- of their retirement-plan
money in the lower-yielding fixed-income investments. Over
time, their returns may be seriously eroded by inflation.
   Such employees would profit from moving more of their
money into growth-oriented stock funds, financial advisers
say. "Shifting from fixed-income to growth could double one's
account over 20 to 30 years," says Mr. Salisbury, since
historically stocks outperform other investments over time.
   Another mistake for many employees is putting too much of
their retirement-plan money in their own companies' stock.
"Doing so leaves employee portfolios top-heavy with one
stock," says  David Eager, managing partner of Eager &amp;
Associates, a management consulting firm in Louisville, Ky.
That's especially true if the company uses its stock to
distribute to the profit-sharing plan or to match employee
contributions.
   Generally, financial advisers recommend that people in
their 20s and 30s invest at least 70% of their retirement
money in stocks, with the rest in bonds or "cash
equivalents," like Treasury bills or money-market mutual
funds. Then, as they grow older people should gradually
reverse the allocation, the advisers say.
   But achieving an appropriate mix of growth and income in a
retirement portfolio isn't as simple as picking among the
combination plates at a Chinese restaurant. Employees must
look at how their 401(k) or profit-sharing plan dovetails
with their other investments.
   Take a man whose company retirement-savings plan is
invested solely in so-called guaranteed investment contracts,
or GICs, which are insurance contracts that pay a fixed rate
of interest usually comparable to certificates of deposit. To
help achieve an appropriate degree of diversification, he
might put all of his individual retirement account money in
stocks.
   Or, consider a woman who is an aggressive stock-market
trader and works for a company that gives employees a choice
between a stock fund and a GIC. She might choose to skip the
stock fund and satisfy her need for fixed income with the GIC
option.
   Employees also have to take into account how flexible
their company plans are. The most desirable plans offer a
variety of investment choices, allow frequent transfers, let
employees contribute both pretax and after-tax dollars, and
match such contributions on a dollar-per-dollar basis, up to
a certain amount.
   All 401(k) plans and 15% of profit-sharing plans allow
employees to contribute pretax dollars, usually up to 6% of
compensation. As this reduces an employee's taxable income,
many people find it too good a deal to pass up.
   Some plans also allow employees to make after-tax
contributions, but the benefits of doing so are less
clear-cut. Although the earnings on after-tax contributions
grow tax-deferred, it might not make sense to tie up one's
money in such accounts if one has other tax-deferred
vehicles, such as annuities or IRAs, that provide more
flexibility and liquidity.
   Advisers say, however, that it does make sense to shovel
as much as one is allowed into such accounts -- whether or
not all the contributions are deductible -- if one's employer
matches some of those savings. Currently, 86% of employers
with 401(k) plans give employees between 50 cents and $1 for
each dollar they contribute, up to 6% of salary in most
cases.
   "Getting 50 cents on the dollar is like getting an instant
50% return on your money," says Karen Frost, a
defined-contribution specialist at Hewitt Associates, a
pension consulting firm in Chicago.
   Accessibility is another factor that may influence an
employee's decision on whether to contribute after-tax
dollars. Many 401(k) plans allow employees to borrow money
from their plans. Employees later pay themselves back,
usually through payroll deduction, at a rate that is tied to
the prime rate, plus one or two percentage points.
   This makes such savings plans more attractive to younger
employees, who may have avoided 401(k)s or declined to make
after-tax contributions because they were worried about tying
up money they may have needed for a down payment on a home,
or for education, says Ms. Frost.
   Plans that don't allow employees to borrow money, but only
to make so-called hardship withdrawals {which are taxable,
and difficult to qualify for}, may be less inviting vehicles
for some employees' after-tax savings.
   How often employees are allowed to transfer among funds in
their plans may also affect their decision. While more and
more plans are allowing monthly transfers, many still
restrict switching to once a year. This might not appeal to
those who load up on equity funds but want the option of
escaping into fixed income if they see trouble directly
ahead, says Ms. Frost.
   Employees who change jobs can roll their retirement
account into a plan with their new employer, or into a
self-directed IRA (which enables employees to transfer their
company stock rather than selling it). But departing
employees might choose to leave their retirement accounts
with their old employers indefinitely. This would make sense
if a stock fund they invested in had suffered a downturn, and
they wanted to wait until it recovered to avoid taking a
loss.
   Some people also might want to leave a retirement account
with a former employer simply because they "prefer the
features and fund options in the old plan," says Frederick
Rumack, director of taxation and legal services at Buck
Consultants, a benefits consulting firm in New York.
   Many companies are making it easier for employees to take
a more active role in managing their retirement accounts, by
making more funds available, increasing the number of
transfers allowed per year, and even by offering toll-free
numbers for performance information, and telephone switching.
   "Since changes are frequent, employees should check with
their benefits department to see what might be available to
them now," says Mr. Salisbury of T. Rowe Price. Benefits
officers can be helpful in explaining plan features and
discussing investment strategies. But they won't provide
investment advice. "They don't want disappointed investors
blaming them for poor results."
