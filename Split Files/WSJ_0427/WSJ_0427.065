   BRUSSELS -- Just less than two years ago, arms maker
Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A. and chemical concern Gechem
S.A. had a lot in common.
   Both were unprofitable units of the sprawling Belgian
holding company Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., and both
were viewed as basket cases. Both had too many employees and
too many activities unrelated to core businesses.

   After a bitter takeover battle, a new management team at
SGB set out to put some order in the company's affiliates. It
designed roughly the same strategy for both units.
   Two years later, Gechem is a textbook example of how a
company can set a goal, decide how to get there, and do it.
FN, meanwhile, is still losing money.
   Analysts say strategy, luck, the quality of management,
and politics all were factors in determining why one company
can thrive today while the other remains mired in familiar
problems.
   SGB's strategy for both concerns was to remold them around
core businesses. The companies were also given capital
injections to reinforce core activities through acquisitions
and internal expansion.
   But SGB Chairman Etienne Davignon conceded SGB made a
mistake in writing the same prescription for two patients.
"At Gechem, we just needed to return to the core businesses,"
he said. "In FN, we needed to readjust the core business,
which takes a lot more work."
   SGB is rethinking its strategy for keeping its FN unit
alive.
   SGB Chairman Davignon said the talks between SGB and FN
management focus on setting goals for FN and deciding how to
attain them. According to the executive, a recovery plan,
with a span of "a couple of years" should be implemented by
the second half.
   The latest talks mark the second attempt by SGB to revive
the unit since SGB was taken over by Cie. Financiere de Suez
of France in 1988.
   The first attempt centered on job cuts and a huge capital
injection. FN also sold a 51% stake in its FN Moteurs S.A.
airplane-engine division. The unit's other core activities,
light weapons and sporting goods, were kept intact.
   The moves were meant to restore FN to profitability by the
end of 1989, but the unit had a loss for the year of 2.5
billion Belgian francs ($71.3 million).
   After earnings were disclosed March 1, SGB and FN's other
main shareholder, the state investment agency, reiterated
their commitments to the unit's recovery. SGB has a 73% stake
in FN, while the agency holds 8%. The rest is publicly
traded.
   The first sign of that commitment was a management
reshuffle, in which industrialist Joseph Labye was appointed
to run the company. Mr. Labye had played a role in the
turnaround of steelmaker Cockerill-Sambre S.A. In addition,
three SGB executives were named to FN's board.
   Belgian market analysts, weary of watching for signs of
recovery at FN, are skeptical about its prospects. One
analyst thinks SGB will possibly sell it.
   FN's problems are a combination of strategic errors,
difficult markets and labor problems, analysts say. The most
fundamental problem is the current downturn in the arms
industry. FN's defense and security division had sales of 7.8
billion Belgian francs in 1988, the last year for which
figures are available, down 37% from 12.35 billion francs in
1985.
   In 1989, when the company was supposed to return to
profitability, some expected defense orders didn't
materialize. Also, 1,200 workers accepted an early-retirement
offer, 400 more than expected, resulting in a big one-time
charge.
   Faced with declining demand for its small arms and intense
competition, FN must search for ways to make a profit on the
lower revenue from its defense business, a company spokesman
said. Although the Browning S.A. division, which makes
hunting rifles and sporting goods, is profitable, analysts
contend its product range is too wide.
   FN's problems are compounded by its location in the
depressed region of Liege in southern Belgium, already
suffering from high unemployment. The company has laid off
about 2,400 people, reducing its staff to 6,000. Further
layoffs, which analysts say are needed, could cause major
social problems and run into political opposition.
   In addition, analysts say, the Belgian government tends to
view FN as a strategic national asset, limiting SGB's options
for the unit.
   The FN spokesman denies the unit is to be sold, either in
part or entirely, to an outside investor. He said, however,
that the possibility of cooperation with a partner in the
arms industry hasn't been excluded.
   Gechem, which last year emerged from a four-year losing
streak to post a record profit, is seeking to consolidate
those gains by expanding in Europe and abroad.
   "We can finally concentrate on the future," Gechem Chief
Executive Officer Jean Durosnoy said. Now that most of a
sweeping revamp is behind it, Mr. Durosnoy said Gechem will
reinforce its core business activities through acquisitions
and internal expansion.
   He said the company's immediate goal is growth in sales to
about 55 billion Belgian francs in 1992, a 28% rise from
1989's 43 billion francs. "But as a personal target,
somewhere in the back of my head, I have the goal of 100
billion francs."
   SGB and Gechem management decided to reshape the company
around two core divisions, Recticel, which makes polyurethane
foam products, and Sadacem, which derives chemicals from
manganese and treats pollutant fluids to recover rare metals.
SGB holds 86% of Gechem.
   Activities that didn't fit in to the core areas were sold,
such as a gunpowder and munitions company and a maker of fine
chemicals.
   Meanwhile, Gechem reinforced Recticel's position as a
supplier of foam rubber to the furniture industry by
acquiring Sclaraffia G.m.b.H., West Germany's leading
manufacturer of mattresses. Smaller acquisitions were made in
Belgium, the United Kingdom and Spain.
   Helped by firm markets for Gechem's main products, the
strategy paid off in 1989, yielding net consolidated
operating profit of 2.9 billion francs.
   Mr. Durosnoy said Gechem isn't quite finished with its
restructuring. He said the company would make at least two
acquisitions in 1990.
   Still to be disposed of are Gechem's share in an
explosives firm and perhaps part of its Recticel USA unit.
   To reach his growth target, Mr. Durosnoy said Recticel,
already Europe's largest maker of foam rubber products, would
seek to become the leader in bedding.
   Recticel also seeks to enlarge its role as a supplier to
the West German auto industry and has a new technology for
sealing car window seams it that it will market this year.
   Eventually, Mr. Durosnoy said, he is convinced Gechem will
have to invest in the U.S. One avenue may be Soundcoat Co.,
which Gechem acquired last year. He said Gechem hopes
Soundcoat will develop new applications for polyurethane
foams in its field of acoustics.
   Mr. Durosnoy said he expects Recticel to perform
"significantly better" in 1990.
   Sadacem, meanwhile, was boosted in 1989 by surging prices
for nonferrous metals the company produces. Mr. Durosnoy said
he doesn't expect Sadacem to match its 1989 profit of 448
million francs.
   Analysts say Sadacem is still too widely spread out and
expect Gechem to narrow its field of activity even more in
1990.
