   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it will begin
rating privately placed debt according to the quality of
covenant protection for investors.
   The private placement market is used by U.S. and foreign
companies that want to raise money without going through the
paperwork and government review required in a public
offering. At the end of 1989, nearly $200 billion of private
placements were outstanding. The Securities and Exchange
Commission recently passed a rule that will make it
significantly easier for issuers to sell privately placed
debt to large, sophisticated investors.

   S&amp;P, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., is known mostly for its
credit ratings, which assess a company's likelihood of
default. The new covenant ratings will assess other issues,
such as how strictly a company's repayment capacity is
protected, or how well a lender is protected against a
takeover that might hurt credit quality.
   S&amp;P is launching its service in conjunction with
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, the nation's largest
private placement investor.
   Frank Rizzo, an S&amp;P managing director, said S&amp;P at first
won't announce its covenant ratings, in hopes of making
issuers more willing to have their covenants rated.
"Ultimately, we want to disseminate the ratings," he said.
