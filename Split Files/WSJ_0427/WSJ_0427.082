   So much for "nostalgia for the Cold War." Remember that
line? Only last summer, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell used it to blister George Bush for too much
"timidity" in assisting Mikhail Gorbachev. Most of Washington
nodded approvingly.
   What a difference Lithuania makes. Now Sen. Mitchell wants
the president to do more "to express disapproval and to deter
further actions" against Lithuania. He modestly suggests
slowing down trade talks. Another Senate Democrat, Maryland's
Barbara Mikulski, feels "mounting outrage and frustration"
that Mr. Bush hasn't been tougher with Moscow. Florida Rep.
Dante Fascell, also not renowned as a hawk, wants Mr. Bush to
postpone the May 30 summit with the Soviet leader.

   Who knows, if this keeps up Congress will soon ask Bob
Gates, the deputy national security adviser, to give that
famous "hard-line" speech that Secretary of State Baker nixed
last year.
   What's going on? Are we all hard-liners now? No, but the
Washington romance with Mikhail Gorbachev is certainly
cooling. Few are yet prepared to end the affair, but
everyone's maneuvering in case there is a breakup. At the
very least, everyone now agrees that Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney was right all along. Mr. Cheney was roundly booed
last year when he said Mr. Gorbachev probably can't long
survive. Now it's hard to find anyone who disagrees. That's
more or less the private consensus of President Bush's own
Sovietologists and the intelligence community. The argument
now is that the U.S. mustn't challenge Mr. Gorbachev on
Lithuania precisely because he is so vulnerable. Yesterday in
Moscow, a Lithuanian man set himself on fire.
   The CIA came up to Capitol Hill last Friday, gave a dire
report on the Soviet economy and no one objected. But
Langley's lament was cheery compared with the 17 Soviet
economists brought to Washington by Nick Eberstadt for the
American Enterprise Institute. They described an economy
about half the size the CIA has long calculated, a military
burden about twice as large, and living standards somewhere
south of Brazil's. A chain-smoking People's Deputy, Vladimir
Tikhonov, called the situation hopeless without immediate and
radical reform. No one said he was exaggerating.
   If nothing else, this new realism solves Mr. Bush's
Who-lost-Gorbachev problem. The precedent here is Panama. Mr.
Bush's agonizing delay in acting against Manuel Noriega had
even Democrats urging him to foment a coup. By the time he
did invade, even Yankee-stay-home types were applauding U.S.
intervention in another nation's affairs. By his caution now
toward Lithuania, Mr. Bush has ensured that if he does ever
impose sanctions and relations with Mr. Gorbachev go sour,
he'll have plenty of accomplices.
   The risk now is that he's embraced Mr. Gorbachev too much.
Some conservatives have already fixed on the appeasement
metaphor. Vytautus Landsbergis, the valiant Lithuanian
president, even said about the West this week, "This is
Munich." But the analogy is false. Mr. Gorbachev isn't
expanding his empire, like Hitler, but is resisting its
contraction.
   If it's a Teutonic analogy we want, the better one may be
Metternich. Lithuania has exposed, more than ever, the roots
of Bush administration foreign policy in national-interest
realism -- the cold-blooded calculation of "interests" and
power. Those roots exist, as they must, in every
administration. But they're more prominent now than at any
time since Henry Kissinger was introducing "realpolitik" to
U.S. dictionaries. (Mr. Kissinger once wrote a book about
Metternich, the 19th-century realpolitician who resisted his
own era's movements for self-determination.)
   Under Presidents Carter and Reagan, realism was wrapped in
a broader and rhetorical idealism. Mr. Carter had human
rights, Mr. Reagan a campaign for democracy and free markets.
George Bush offers mainly "stability" and world "realities."
It's partly a problem of rhetoric, but the rhetorical failure
makes it also seem a failure to sympathize with Balts and
Chinese pursuing American ideals.
   Even when the arguments have merit, as they do with
Lithuania, it's doubtful they can prevail over time unlinked
to broader American principles. Americans have a moral streak
and little patience with realpolitik. Mr. Bush's China policy
has already withered under attack. Yesterday his detente with
Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who has threatened to use chemical
weapons against Israel, was assailed in Congress as "Alice in
Wonderland."
   Some of the younger Bush officials appear to understand
this vulnerability. A month ago Mr. Baker was set to deliver
what was advertised as a major speech on democracy as a goal
and tool of U.S. foreign policy. Some officials lobbied to
include the dread word, "Lithuania." But the White House said
no, lest it somehow offend Mr. Gorbachev. Not surprisingly,
the speech wasn't taken seriously.
   Mr. Bush says the polls support him on Lithuania. But as
the president might also say, polls are fickle things. China
was a tolerable tyranny -- until TV cameras showed us
Tiananmen Square. More scenes like yesterday's of Balts
burning themselves in Moscow could change American opinion,
just as Buddhists once did in Saigon.
   Democrats would like nothing better than to get to the
right of George Bush on the world's aspirations for liberty.
If we've learned anything about George Mitchell, it's that he
is a flexible critic.
