   TOKYO -- Weakness in Japanese financial markets has
changed formerly sanguine corporate views of business
prospects and led many companies to expect the economy to
contract over the next 12 months, according to the Federation
of Economic Organizations, known as Keidanren.
   A survey of executives at 245 major companies, conducted
in late March and early April, showed 60% believe the economy
will end its protracted expansion in the second half of the
fiscal year that began April 1. In a survey conducted by
Keidanren in December, only 35% said they expected the
economy to turn down in the second half of the year.

   Despite problems in the Japanese economy, the average of
companies' replies shows they expect inflation-adjusted
growth of 4% in the current fiscal year.
   The Japanese economy has been expanding for 41 consecutive
months, fueled by high corporate investment and personal
consumption.
   The tightening of Japanese financial markets since January
was the most-often cited cause of a contraction, according to
Keidanren. Of the companies surveyed, 38% blamed financial
markets for the chance of a downturn, while 29% pointed to
inflation stemming from rising labor and commodity prices.
