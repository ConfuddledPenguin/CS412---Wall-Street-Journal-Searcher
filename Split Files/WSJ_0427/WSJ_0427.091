   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and the Soviet Union agreed to
normalize bilateral trade relations for the first time in
half a century, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz
said.
   The trade pact, which requires congressional approval,
would offer the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status,
meaning that that country's goods could enter the U.S. at the
lowest tariff rates available. A senior Bush administration
official recently said that with the pact, U.S.-Soviet
bilateral trade soon could total between $10 billion and $15
billion a year, compared with between $1 billion to $3
billion in recent years.

   U.S.-Soviet trade currently consists mostly of U.S. grain
sales to the Soviet Union. Moscow hasn't had much success
selling to the U.S., partly because its products are subject
to tariffs that often are several times higher than those
applied to most other foreign goods.
   It had been expected that the U.S. might try to use the
trade-pact negotiations as leverage to try to soften current
Soviet pressure on Lithuania. The Soviet Union recently moved
to cut energy and other supplies to that Baltic republic,
which is seeking independence from the Soviet Union. But
President Bush this week declined to impose sanctions, and
Ambassador Katz said there had been no discussion of
Lithuania in the talks, which took place in Paris.
   "Fundamentally, we have reached agreement on the text,"
said Ambassador Katz, the chief U.S. negotiator, adding that
he expects a few remaining issues to be resolved in a few
weeks. "As far as I am concerned, we have substantial
agreement." The U.S. negotiator cautioned that although the
text has been largely worked out, there is as yet no signed
or initialed text. But he added that he didn't see any
obstacles that would prevent President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev from signing the pact at their summit
meeting in late May and early June.
   The bilateral accord would run for three years and is
automatically renewable for three-year periods, the U.S.
trade negotiator said. But President Bush can sign the new
trade agreement only after he has certified that the Soviet
Union is allowing free emigration of Soviet Jews and other
dissidents. The Soviet Union currently is considering more
liberal emigration laws, and the president has said he will
sign the waiver once these are enacted.
   Ambassador Katz spoke to reporters in a telephone
conference call from Paris, where the two nations were just
completing one of several rounds of talks.
   The proposed agreement covers such areas as "commercial
offices in each country, facilitation of business, provisions
on transparency with respect to rules and regulations,
financial regulations as they relate to trade, and provisions
for the intellectual property protection," Ambassador Katz
said.
   The pact also has provisions to guard against market
disruption from surges in imports. The text of the agreement
won't be disclosed for days or weeks until the final points
are sorted out. The accord will be accompanied by a number of
side letters relating to such issues as ways to resolve trade
problems, tourism, intellectual property and financial
relations.
