   Alcan Aluminium Ltd. shareholders at the annual meeting
approved a holder rights plan, with the results indicating
many big holders voted against the plan.
   More than 14,000 holders voted 82.7 million shares, or
about 54.1% of those tallied, in favor of the plan, while the
68.4 million shares, or 44.7%, that were voted against it had
just 734 holders. Of the total cast, 1.2% didn't indicate
"yes" or "no."

   "There's a violent reaction amongst institutional
investors" to holder rights plans, said David Morton, Alcan
chairman and chief executive officer. After the meeting, he
said the vote shows "the small shareholder is happy" with
Alcan's plan. He said the votes against the plan represent
institutional investors' "philosophical concerns" with such
plans, designed to make unwanted takeover bids prohibitively
expensive.
   Under Alcan's plan, rights attached to common shares allow
holders to acquire authorized but unissued stock at half the
market price, under certain conditions, including a person or
group's acquiring at least 20% of the shares outstanding.
