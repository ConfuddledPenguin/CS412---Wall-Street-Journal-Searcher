   LONDON -- Britain's simmering rivalry over satellite
television is about to escalate into open warfare.
   British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., a competitor of
Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, plans to beam five channels
of movies, sports, entertainment and news into U.K. homes
starting Sunday.

   British Satellite, which plans to back the launch with a
#100 million ($163 million) promotional campaign during the
first year, is delaying television ads promoting the service
because of shortages in the satellite-receiving equipment
viewers will need to see it. But company officials say the
shortages will be short-lived. They vow that the ads, and
ample supplies of receivers, will come about two weeks after
the launch.
   The battle between the newcomer and Sky TV, a unit of Mr.
Murdoch's News Corp., "is going to be absolutely red-hot
competition," says Anthony Simonds-Gooding, British
Satellite's chief executive. Both satellite-TV operators will
survive the multibillion-dollar battle, he predicts. "But
only one will be rich. The other will be a bit nearer to the
bread line."
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Simonds-Gooding believes his private
consortium, backed by several Murdoch rivals, will emerge as
the rich one. He cites its hefty marketing plans, different
programming strategy and hopes to get satellite-receiving
equipment into stores faster than Sky TV did before its
February 1989 launch. "We are going to win" the coming sky
war, he says.
   Some industry watchers are much less bullish about British
Satellite's prospects. "I think BSB is now in position to
lose a lot of money," says Brian Sturgess, an analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, a U.K. securities firm. "We are going
to have one hell of a bloody battle."
   British Satellite has higher overhead than Sky TV because
it paid more for Hollywood film rights and owns rather than
leases its satellite. British Satellite's backers -- which
include Pearson PLC, a diversified conglomerate that owns the
Financial Times, and publishing company Reed International
PLC -- are less experienced broadcasters than News Corp.,
which owns U.S. television stations through its Fox
Broadcasting Co. unit. And British Satellite, forced by
technical hitches to delay its introduction from last fall,
is trying to unseat an entrenched rival with a 14-month head
start.
   Sky TV, which isn't yet profitable, has had its share of
troubles. Mr. Murdoch, in an interview earlier this month,
said Sky TV had accumulated operating losses of #250 million
since its February 1989 launch. Equipment shortages and
consumer confusion about the new technology meant few people
were watching when it began beaming TV signals to homes in
Britain and Ireland.
   But the Murdoch venture now is gaining wider acceptance.
That's partly because of a cheap rental subscription package
introduced last September, which analysts believe has
attracted about 400,000 households. The package, costing
#4.45 a week, may appear more affordable to many people than
buying British Satellite's equipment for #350. Through
independent dealers, however, consumers can pay about #22 a
month to rent gear to receive the British Satellite service.
   More than 800,000 U.K. homes currently receive Sky TV's
four channels, either by satellite dish or cable, a spokesman
says. Nearly 1.4 million households in Britain and Ireland
get at least one channel.
   Sky TV also has begun to lure major advertisers. Six big
companies such as Unilever Group, the Anglo-Dutch
consumer-products giant, recently agreed to become "charter"
advertisers. They get attractive rates in exchange for
agreeing to spend #4 million each on commercials over two
years. British Satellite is offering similar discounts for
big-spending advertisers and says it already has sold 70% of
the air time for the first several weeks after its start-up.
   Mr. Murdoch probably will devise other marketing gimmicks
to repel British Satellite. Analysts speculate that he may
lower the price of the discount subscription package and use
his U.K. tabloid newspapers, as he did earlier, to promote
vendors' sales of satellite dishes -- or to knock the
opposition. But additional newspaper promotions aren't
planned right now, says Fiona Waters, a Sky TV official,
because "we are doing such heavy business on the rental
side."
   British Satellite's initial marketing effort, part of a
three-year #300 million drive, probably will emphasize its
British roots and programming tailored for U.K. tastes. "We
are intrinsically British," rather than Australian or
American, as many Sky TV officials are, says Mr.
Simonds-Gooding. For instance, he notes, the consortium's
sports channel will focus on British sporting events, in
contrast to Sky TV's pan-European approach.
   Sky TV also offers a 24-hour news channel, while British
Satellite mainly will provide brief news updates on all of
its channels. An all-news channel "is very expensive," Mr.
Simonds-Gooding says. "You want to put your money into
programs that people want."
   The consortium expects to accumulate losses of #1 billion
by 1993 before reaching the break-even point. Mr. Murdoch
expects Sky TV's losses to reach #350 million before his
service reaches break-even, perhaps as soon as late next
year.
