   Are Keeping a Close Eye on Each Other

   AMSTERDAM -- Elsevier N.V. and Wolters Kluwer N.V., Dutch
masters in the art of earning big profits from obscure
publications, are scouring Europe and the U.S. in the hope of
buying more of them. At the same time, the two
Amsterdam-based publishers are keeping a wary eye on each
other.
   Elsevier owns a third of Wolters Kluwer, and Pierre
Vinken, Elsevier's chairman, has long made it clear he would
like to see the two merge. Some investment analysts believe
it is just a matter of time before that happens. But Wolters
Kluwer is playing hard to get.

   "We are doing quite well on our own," Mijndert Ververs,
chairman of Wolters Kluwer, said in an interview. "From a
defensive point of view, there is no necessity for an
alliance."
   Indeed, Wolters Kluwer is already the product of a
defensive alliance. In 1987, when Elsevier made a hostile bid
for Kluwer B.V., the latter publisher rushed into the arms of
a white knight, Wolters Samsom Groep N.V.
   The combined company owes much of its success to
publishing nitty-gritty legal and tax information. Bolstered
by acquisitions in Spain, France and West Germany over the
past two years, Wolters Kluwer expects to benefit handsomely
as the European Community's unified market program spews out
legal, tax and regulatory changes, all needing translation
and explanation.
   Elsevier's biggest strength has long been in scientific
journals. The company has about 650 of them, with such
forbidding titles as the Journal of Hepatology, Tectono
physics, and Geschneider's Handbook on the Physics and
Chemistry of Rare Earths (all of them "unreadable," Mr.
Vinken confides cheerfully). Such journals, sold world-wide,
may never be big sellers at airport newsstands, but
scientists swear by them and Mr. Vinken says the profit
margins are around 30%.
   Elsevier has concentrated on these and other high-profit
niches, including professional and trade publications, while
shedding lower-margin publications and printing operations.
That strategy has helped Elsevier keep its average annual
profit growth above 20% for two decades. But the company's
very success has prompted analysts to question whether
Elsevier can keep up such a pace much longer without
resorting to huge, risky acquisitions.
   "Elsevier seems to have reached a stage of maturity," says
Willem Burgers, an analyst at the Amsterdam brokerage firm of
Van Meer James Capel N.V. Though Mr. Vinken says he has long
warned that 20% profit growth couldn't be sustained forever,
he sees no sign of stagnation yet.
   For the next few years, however, many analysts see more
potential profit growth from Wolters Kluwer than from
Elsevier. The latter's operating profit last year was 17% of
sales. Wolters Kluwer, by contrast, turned in a 12% margin
but expects that to rise to 15% by 1992.
   Using a strategy that closely resembles that of Elsevier,
Wolters Kluwer is pruning businesses with low profit margins.
It plans to sell a majority stake in its chain of bookstores,
and earlier this month the company announced an agreement to
sell nearly all of its remaining printing plants for an
undisclosed sum.
   Only about 44% of Wolters Kluwer's 1989 revenue of 1.88
billion guilders ($984 million) came from outside the
Netherlands, but the company aims to raise that percentage
above 50% by making further acquisitions abroad.
   Mr. Ververs says he expects at least two more purchases in
Spain this year. In the U.S., where Wolters Kluwer already
publishes medical journals and operates an AIDS data base,
Mr. Ververs says the company is in talks aimed at acquiring a
publisher with revenue of more than $100 million a year. He
declined to identify the target.
   In addition, he says, Wolters Kluwer is looking for
further acquisitions in northern Italy, France and West
Germany.
   Elsevier is concentrating more of its attention lately on
acquisitions in Europe, particularly in areas such as
financial, medical, real-estate and other professional
information. It also is exploring commercial television,
having acquired a stake in a small Dutch-language broadcaster
last year.
   Some analysts have speculated that Elsevier might try to
improve its profit margins further by selling its Dutch
newspaper interests, which include the prestigious NRC
Handelsblad and the Algemeen Dagblad. Though the newspapers
produce much lower margins than specialized publications, Mr.
Vinken says there is no plan to sell them. Still, he doesn't
dispute the idea that a move away from newspapers might fit
with Elsevier's long-term strategy of avoiding mass markets.
