   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Businessland Inc., as expected,
reported a loss for its third quarter of $1.7 million, or six
cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $8.5
million, or 27 cents a share.
   Sales increased 10% in the quarter ended March 31 to
$323.4 million from $293.3 million. In composite trading
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's
shares closed at $9.25, unchanged.

   Hurt by personal-computer price battles, the computer
retailer also said earnings at its primary U.S. operations
were substantially offset by losses at its ComputerCraft
retail unit and at its United Kingdom operations.
   For the nine months, the company said earnings plunged 94%
to $1.4 million, or four cents a share, compared with
year-earlier net of $25.5 million, or 85 cents a share. Sales
increased 17% to $1.01 billion from $866.2 million.
   Earlier this month, Businessland surprised analysts with
its disclosure of the loss. Analysts had expected a profit of
$4 million to $5 million in the quarter. Yesterday, the
company said that its revenue was less than anticipated for
the quarter and that the decline resulted in higher expenses
as a percentage of sales. Moreover, lower-than-anticipated
margins outside the U.S. affected gross margins.
   As reported, the company has initiated cost-cutting
measures, including firing 15 to 20 of the 170 employees in
the U.K. The firm said that may bring U.K. operations back to
profitability.
