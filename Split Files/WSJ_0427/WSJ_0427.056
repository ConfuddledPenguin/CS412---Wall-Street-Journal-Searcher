   LONDON -- Net new investment in United Kingdom investment
trusts registered a net deficit of #18.6 million ($30.4
million) in March, compared with a net new investment gain of
#303.5 million in February and #211.3 million in March 1989,
the Unit Trust Association said this week.
   The loss figure in the latest month is the lowest since
May 1988. Julian Shersby, the UTA's information and
statistical secretary, attributed March's net loss of
investment funds to higher-than-usual withdrawals by Japanese
investors seeking to square losses resulting from falls in
their own stock market over the month.

   Also, other investors sold funds ahead of the end of the
financial year in March in an attempt to reduce their
liability to taxation on capital profits for the year, he
said. "Some of this will have gone into bank and building
society accounts rather than back into investment trusts," he
added.
   Funds under management by UTA members rose slightly to
#55.5 billion, up 0.7% from #55.2 billion in February and up
13% from #49.2 billion held in March 1989.
   Sales of investment trust shares to investors fell to
#825.9 million in the latest month, down 13% from #951.8
million in February, though up 2.4% from #806.7 million a
year ago.
   However, repurchases of shares by the trusts from
investors rose 30% on the month to #844.5 million from #648.3
million. The March figure is up 42% from #595.4 million in
March 1989.
