   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's producer prices in March fell 0.1%
from February, but rose 4.5% from a year earlier, Statistics
Sweden, the national statistics agency, said.
   Export prices in March dropped 0.3% from February, but
were up 3.2% from the year-earlier month. Import prices in
March slipped 1.2% from February, mainly because of falling
oil prices, but rose 0.9% from a year earlier.
