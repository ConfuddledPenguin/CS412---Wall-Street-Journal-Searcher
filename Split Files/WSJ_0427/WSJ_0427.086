   PARIS -- Bernard Arnault won France's luxury war.
   His hands now are free to consolidate and develop LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the conglomerate of world-famous
champagne, cognac, perfume, luggage and fashion products that
he runs.

   Mr. Arnault's victory came yesterday, when an appeals
court here refused his rivals' effort to have a large block
of his shares nullified. Mr. Arnault's main rival,
77-year-old Vuitton family leader Henry Racamier, who fought
him for nearly two years, immediately resigned from the
group. Mr. Racamier had been chairman of the Louis Vuitton
unit.
   "Now we can finally build a team that will cooperate to
develop our brands," Mr. Arnault said after learning of his
antagonist's departure. "And now we are free to proceed with
acquisitions, several of which we have under study."
   He said he is considering acquiring brands both in his
current product lines and in new lines, although he insisted
that he won't pay inflated prices.
   Mr. Arnault's troubles probably aren't over. Mr. Racamier
warned after the court decision that the Vuitton family,
which controls about 20% of the group's shares and 25% of
voting rights, "will continue to defend vigilantly the
integrity of the companies and their brands." In the past,
Mr. Racamier has threatened to seek allies among other
shareholders and try to block some of Mr. Arnault's
decisions.
