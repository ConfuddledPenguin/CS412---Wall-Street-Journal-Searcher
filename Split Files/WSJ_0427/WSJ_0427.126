   LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp. said it will buy and scrap
7,000 cars built before 1971 as part of a corporate program
to reduce pollution in the Los Angeles area.
   The $5 million voluntary repurchase effort by the oil
company is believed to be the first such step anywhere.
Unocal and regulatory officials said the program isn't tied
to pollution abatement at company facilities.

   Older vehicles account for a disproportionate share of
auto emissions. Those built before 1971, for instance, can
spew as much as 30 times the fumes of today's models. Some
economists have urged scrapping clunkers as a cost-effective
way to cut pollution. But the suggestion has been a political
hot potato, with conservatives opposed to government action
and liberals worried that repurchase programs or outright
bans would deprive the poor of transportation.
   Unocal said it will pay $700 a car and provide a free,
one-month bus pass to those who drive their cars to a
company-selected scrap yard. Would-be sellers must first make
an appointment by calling a toll-free number after Wednesday.
Unocal said it believed that these older cars can be
replaced, in some cases, for about $700 with cleaner-burning
models.
   In a related step, the company said it will offer free
emissions checks and tuneups at its Los Angeles-area service
stations for cars built before 1975. It estimated the cost of
this program at about $5 million. Unocal also said it will
begin a free roadside service for stranded cars that tie up
traffic.
   Unocal's repurchase program will remove less than 2% of
the 410,000 pre-1971 cars in the Los Angeles area, where the
company is based. According to company calculations, at best
its two programs will cut about 23 million pounds of the more
than four billion pounds of pollutants emitted annually by
vehicles in the Los Angeles region, whose air is the nation's
most polluted.
   However, company officials said they hoped their efforts
would encourage other companies to undertake similar
programs. "This is a good-faith effort by this company to
improve the quality of life in Los Angeles," said Richard J.
Stegemeier, Unocal chairman, president, and chief executive
officer.
   A local environmental agency applauded Unocal's plan.
"It's hard to conceive of the oil industry doing this just a
year or two ago," said Tom Eichhorn, spokesman for the Los
Angeles area's Air Quality Management District.
   But oil companies have adopted an environmentally
conscious theme of late. Atlantic Richfield Co., for
instance, has made a major marketing coup with a reformulated
gasoline designed to cut emissions in older cars. Other
companies have followed Arco's lead.
   Unocal won't reformulate its gasoline blends anytime soon,
Mr. Stegemeier said. The company is the fourth largest
gasoline marketer in the competitive Los Angeles area, with
about 14% of the market, company officials said. Arco is the
region's leading marketer.
