   NEW YORK -- Yields on Treasury notes and bonds spurted
above 9% yesterday, the highest level in a year, as bond
dealers slashed prices in an effort to attract buyers.
   "The market is really getting trashed; it's a fire sale,"
said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., a managing director at Stone &amp;
McCarthy Research Associates.

   The high yields have encouraged scores of individual
investors to buy bonds for the first time in months. But
large institutional investors, who carry far more weight than
small investors, are reducing their bond portfolios for fear
that prices will continue to erode.
   Dealers said these big investors, both domestic and
foreign, began to sell bonds early in the day on rumors that
the government's report on first-quarter gross national
product, due out this morning, will show a large jump in
economic growth.
   While that may be good for businesses and the economy, the
bond market reacts badly to such news because investors fear
that a pickup in economic activity could lead to higher
inflation and interest rates, two trends that reduce the
value and appeal of most fixed-income securities.
   "With GNP coming, some investors are terrified. They don't
want to own bonds," said Jay Goldinger, a trader at Capital
Insight, a brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   The selling picked up steam as the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond yield broke above 9%, a technical support level,
for the first time since May 1989. At that point, "the bond
market dropped like a stone," said Christopher Rupkey, a
financial economist at Mitsubishi Bank. "People were focusing
on 9% and when rates vaulted that level, selling
accelerated," he said. The yield rose as high as 9.04% but
ended at 9.03%.
   Michael Krauss, a technical analyst at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc., believes the next technical
support level will be 9.10% which was the previous high yield
on the 30-year bond. He expects the bond market to rally at
that level, at least for a brief period. "I'm long-term
bearish," he said.
   Yesterday's selling caused the price of the benchmark
30-year Treasury bond to fall 3/4 point, a loss of about
$7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Reports
expect the government to report this morning that
inflation-adjusted gross national product grew at an annual
rate of 2.7% in the first quarter. That's more than double
the 1.1% growth rate in the fourth-quarter and suggests to
traders that interest rates could be headed higher.
   "There is a general perspective that the market will lead
the Federal Reserve into a policy firming that eventually
will lead to a higher federal funds rate," said Joel Kazis,
manager of government trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. The federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on
overnight loans, has remained at about 8 1/4% since late
December.
   Also contributing to the market's depression was a huge $1
billion offering of 30-year bonds by Chrysler Corp.'s Auburn
Hills Trust. Dealers said underwriters and some investors who
bought the bonds hedged their positions by selling 30-year
Treasury bonds. Chrysler's guaranteed exchangeable
certificates were priced at par to yield 12 3/8%.
   Adding to the market's bearish mood was concern about next
month's quarterly refunding of the federal debt, at which
time the government is scheduled to auction $30 billion of
securities.
   "If the market can't absorb $10.5 billion of two-year
notes," that were sold by the government on Wednesday,
"people are wondering what will happen," next month at the
refunding, said Mr. McCarthy. The two-year note auction was a
disappointment and caused bond prices to slide after the
auction results were announced. Although small investors were
big buyers of the two-year notes, institutional investors
shied away from the auction.
   The talk of the market was Chrysler's giant $1 billion
30-year bond offering.
   The size of the issue was increased from an originally
planned $800 million, a surprising development considering
underwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc. initially had trouble
drumming up sufficient demand for the bonds.
   But orders materialized after Salomon was forced by
investors to sweeten the terms of the issue. The 30-year
securities were priced at par to yield 12.375%, far higher
than the 11 3/4% to 12% yield that Chrysler anticipated.
Underwriters also made the bonds more attractive by adding a
noncall feature. The bonds had been slated to be callable in
10 years. Investors prefer noncallable issues because there's
no risk of early redemption if interest rates fall.
   The bond certificates will actually be issued by Auburn
Hills Trust, which will hold the title to Chrysler Technology
Center and lease the facilities back to Chrysler. The parent
company will guarantee the issue.
   Unlike previous Chrysler deals, yesterday's issue provided
bondholder protection in the form of event-risk language.
Essentially, should Chrysler debt be downgraded, or upgraded,
the coupon on the issue would be adjusted to reflect the
change.
   For example, if Moody's Investors Service Inc. or Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. downgrade Chrysler debt one full rating
category, the coupon on the issue would be increased by 2.5
percentage points.
   In trading yesterday, most investment-grade bonds posted
declines of up to 3/8 point.
   Most junk bonds ended unchanged to slightly lower. One
notable exception: Ames Department Stores Inc. The retailer's
junk bonds, which had been losing ground for weeks, advanced
on news that the company filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Ames's 13% senior subordinated reset notes rose two points
to close at 22. Sometimes, a company's bonds will rise
temporarily after a bankruptcy filing as so-called vulture
investors scramble to amass large blocks of bonds. The active
trading drives prices higher.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
94 12/32 to yield 9.03% compared with 95 2/32 to yield 8.97%
on Wednesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 96
10/32 to yield 9.05% compared with 96 25/32 to yield 8.98% on
Wednesday.
   Short-term rates rose yesterday. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.83% for a bond
equivalent yield of 8.078% while the discount rate on
six-month bills ended at 8.01% for a bond-equivalent yield of
8.442%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were unchanged to 3/4 point lower in late
dealings, as a large number of institutional sellers
contributed to the session's brisk activity.
   "There are more sellers than buyers," said one trader.
"We're very low and there are very few people sticking up
their heads to buy bonds."
   To characterize the market's weakening tone, a trader
pointed to the 2024 term bond of an issue of $283 million
Transmission Agency of Northern California revenue bonds.
Late in the session, the bond was quoted at 94 3/8 to yield
7.45%, which is eight basis points higher than the original
offering level. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage
point.
   In new-issue activity, a Bear Stearns &amp; Co. group
successfully bid for $120 million East Bay Municipal Utility
District, Calif., water system subordinated revenue bonds.
The bonds were priced for reoffering to yield from 7.20% in
2001 to 7.60% in 2020.
   Among active bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue due in 2018 fell 1/4 point to 95 1/4, to yield
7.60%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A rebound in the value of the yen and rumors that a large
Japanese securities firm was marking up prices boosted the
Japanese government bond market.
   Dealers said that trading activity, however, remained
thin. On Tuesday, the Finance Ministry auctioned the May
issue of the 10-year Japanese government bond. Market
participants said the top bidders at the auction were Salomon
Brothers Asia Ltd., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities
Co. and Nomura Securities Co.
   Dealers said with three of next week's trading sessions
closed for Japanese national holidays, the market is not
expected to move much by the end of the week.
   At the 3 p.m. JST (2 a.m. EDT) close of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond had risen
0.22 point to 86.11 for a yield of 7.345%.
   In other markets:
   -- British government bonds fell again, although the pace
of the declines slowed markedly after Wednesday's hectic
sell-off. Dealers said that yesterday's price declines were a
carry-over from Wednesday, when a wider-than-expected March
current account deficit caused long-term government bonds to
fall 1 3/8 point.
   Yesterday, the benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due
2003/2007 ended 10/32 lower at 94 17/32 to yield 12.52%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage rates are heading toward 11% because of recent
losses in the mortgage-securities market.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered yesterday to
buy fixed-rate 30-year loans from lenders for 10.67%, up
nearly one-tenth of a percentage point from Wednesday and the
highest rate in nearly a year.
   Since consumers pay about 3/8 percentage point more than
the Freddie Mac posted rate, fixed-rate mortgage soon should
be nearing 11%.
   Meanwhile, mortgage securities continued their recent
slide and ended 7/32 to 11/32 lower on the day.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 93 10/32, down 10/32; the 9 1/2% issue
at 95 30/32, down 9/32; and the 10% issue at 98 19/32, down
7/32. Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% securities were at 95 3/4, down
11/32.
   Dealers said there was fairly heavy selling of mortgage
issues by a number of institutional investors.
