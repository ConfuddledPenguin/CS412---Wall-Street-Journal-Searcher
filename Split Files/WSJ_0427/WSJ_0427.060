   BTR PLC, whose hostile bid for Norton Co. was topped
Wednesday by friendly suitor Cie. de Saint-Gobain S.A.,
disclosed that it sold its Norton stake soon after
Saint-Gobain's $90-a-share offer was announced.
   London-based BTR had said it didn't plan to top
Saint-Gobain's $1.9 billion offer for Norton. In a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing, BTR reported that it sold its
325,000 shares, or 1.7% stake, in Norton for $88.6615 a share
in the open market. BTR, which last month launched a
$75-a-share, or $1.64 billion, hostile bid for Norton, bought
its Norton stock for between $49.54 and $53 a share.

   Meanwhile, Norton held an anticlimactic annual
shareholders meeting in Worcester, Mass., where it is based.
Before agreeing to be acquired by Saint-Gobain, a French
maker of glass, packaging and building materials, Norton
faced the prospect of a prolonged takeover battle against BTR
that Norton was expected to lose.
   "I feel like a condemned prisoner who has received an
11th-hour pardon from the governor," John M. Nelson, Norton's
chairman, president and chief executive officer, told those
at the meeting. Mr. Nelson received a standing ovation from
the audience. Many who attended were Norton employees who had
staged rallies to support Norton's resistance to BTR. They
were clearly pleased with a commitment by Saint-Gobain, made
in its acquisition agreement with Norton, to retain Norton's
existing policies on employment and other matters.
   In a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Nelson
disclosed that when trying to fend off BTR, Norton had
approached some 20 companies in hopes of finding a friendly
suitor to buy a minority stake in Norton. Six to eight of
them had taken a detailed look at Norton, but only
Saint-Gobain made a "concrete" offer, he added. Saint-Gobain,
however, wanted to acquire Norton outright, which Norton's
directors agreed to in order to avoid a "war of attrition"
with BTR, Mr. Nelson said.
   Mr. Nelson also said Saint-Gobain had agreed to pay $90 a
share for Norton "very early" in the negotiations between the
companies, and the talks had centered mainly on concessions
Norton wanted from Saint-Gobain aimed at keeping Norton in
its present form for at least five years.
   While Norton's purchase by Saint-Gobain is expected to be
completed, at least one sticky wicket remains: the question
of whether the transaction threatens national security.
Norton makes abrasives, ceramics and other products, and its
customers include various branches of the U.S. military. When
battling with BTR, Norton and its supporters raised national
security issues about Norton's acquisition by a foreign
company. At least one congressman, Rep. Silvio O. Conte (R.,
Mass.) has stated that he supports an investigation by
President Bush into national security issues surrounding
Norton's purchase by Saint-Gobain, although he termed it a
"far superior option" compared with a takeover by BTR.
