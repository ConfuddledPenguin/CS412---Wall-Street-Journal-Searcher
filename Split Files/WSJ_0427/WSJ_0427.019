   The Paper of Record may become the Videotape of Record.
   New York Times Co. is offering a videocassette that "tells
how to cover nuclear events more safely," according to an ad
that appeared in the Times twice recently. The ad was
headlined, "Journalists: Are You Prepared To Cover The Next
Nuclear Accident?" There is an 800-number for orders, and no,
it isn't 800-FALLOUT.

   The videotape, which runs about 55 minutes, was first
produced for in-house use at a cost of about $12,000. "We
thought we'd recoup some of our production costs by selling
it to the outside," says Matthew Wald, a Times correspondent
who covers energy and the nuclear industry and who helped put
together the tape.
   How fast the tape will sell remains to be seen, however.
The Times is asking $249, considerably more than the prices
of other instructional tapes. "How to Lambada," for example,
can be had for just $9.95, while "Little League's Official
How-To-Play Baseball Video" retails for $29.95.
   And those who think the tape will reveal secrets of how
the New York Times sets out reporting a story will be
disappointed. The videotape, which was produced in one day at
a TV station in Scranton, Pa., owned by the Times' parent
company, doesn't offer reporting tips, and no New York Times
reporter appears on it. Instead, the tape is a lecture with
animated displays on how to use radiation-detection
equipment, according to Mr. Wald. "It is not as boring as it
implies," he says. "In fact, it's rather interesting, and if
you were sent to cover a nuclear accident, you would find it
fascinating."
   The idea for the videocassette came after the Times
provided radiation-detection equipment for its domestic and
foreign bureaus. "We decided some of the instructions were
better delivered on camera instead of just in a pamphlet,"
says Mr. Wald.
   The cassette is the first offering from the New York Times
Video Education Library, Mr. Wald says. He concedes that
"Covering a Radiation Accident" isn't destined to become the
next "Rambo" at the local videocassette rental store.
   Of course, some newspapers might not want to purchase a
safety film from a competitor. Eugene Roberts, executive
editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, which won a Pulitzer
Prize in 1979 for its coverage of the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident in Middletown, Pa., says, "We have no
immediate plans to buy one."
