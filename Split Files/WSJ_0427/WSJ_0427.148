   DON'T BE FOOLED into thinking Beer Drinkers of America is
just a fun-loving fraternity. It has a shrewd agenda, and
clever backers.
   The three-year-old organization, which is based in Costa
Mesa, Calif., boasts 400,000 members in 30 states and
sponsors activities such as a "Party Smart" educational
program on 500 college campuses. For an annual fee of $10 a
year, members celebrate the camaraderie of imbibing and
receive a quarterly publication called Heads Up.
   But there's more to it than tossing back a few cold ones.
The group is also an aggressive lobbyist. When tax increases
on alcohol are threatened, the organization quickly, and
successfully, mobilizes its members in letter-writing
campaigns. Last year the group fought proposed increases in
beer taxes in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Arizona,
winning all but New York, says Rob Cook, a spokesman for Beer
Drinkers.
   And oh yes, the organization receives about a third of its
funding from beer marketers such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and
Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos.
   That's where critics come in. Bob Reynolds, who heads a
group seeking an increase in California's alcohol taxes, says
that while the organization doesn't deny its ties to beer
marketers, "they're not straightforward about their sources
of funding." In fact, the group's literature doesn't mention
the link.
   "They're just putting a layer of consumers between the
government and the beer industry," adds Patricia Taylor,
director of alcohol policies at the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a group in Washington.
   Mr. Cook concedes Beer Drinkers depends on money from
brewers, although he says the group is working to wean itself
from industry support. But beer lovers are a beleaguered lot,
who need protection from puritan activists, he says.
"Prohibitionists never went away."
   Brewers are happy for the support they get in return. Says
Stephen Lambright, an Anheuser-Busch vice president, "We
believe Beer Drinkers of America can be helpful in supporting
the right of American consumers to enjoy beer responsibly,
without undue government interference -- especially in the
form of discriminatory excise taxes."
                                                                                                       

   Parking-Meter Ads
   Hit a Detour in Boston
                                                                                                       

   IF PROPONENTS have it their way, Bostonians may soon see
commercial pitches when they pull up to parking meters.
   Two competing companies, Baltimore-based American Parking
Meters Inc. and Parc-Ads of a Mattapoisett, Mass., have
similar proposals to affix miniature billboards to Boston's
meters or poles. The companies would turn over a percentage
of the ad revenue to the city, not to mention report any
broken meters.
   "This gives advertisers a way to create impulse buying
among center-city pedestrians," says Tony Lockwood, of
Parc-Ads, a start-up company. Mr. Lockwood says McDonald's
Corp. and Reebok International Ltd. already have expressed
interest.
   Meter ads could generate up to $500,000 a year for the
city, figures Ted O'Hearn, the New England representative for
American Parking Meters, which already sells meter ads in
Baltimore.
   Just one hitch. Massachusetts has an outdoor advertising
law that specifically prohibits meter ads. A bill that would
give each municipality power to overturn the ban was
introduced by state Sen. William MacLean Jr. But the state
apparently isn't ready to relinquish control. The bill has
been relegated to a study committee, where bills often
languish.
                                                                                                       

   Small Rival Has a Bone
   To Pick With Wendy's
                                                                                                       

   WHICH COMES first, the chicken sandwich or the other
chicken sandwich?
   Executives at Chick-fil-A, a closely held Atlanta-based
chain with 413 restaurants, are hopping mad about Wendy's
International Inc.'s recent ads stating that Wendy's has the
"best chicken sandwiches in the business."
   That's impossible, says Jimmy Collins, president of the
smaller competitor, because Chick-fil-A's independent
research shows consumers consider his chain's sandwiches
tops. The problem, according to Chick-fil-A, is that Wendy's
independent research was skewed toward burger eaters, rather
than fast-food consumers in general. "We don't mind them
claiming to have the best chicken sandwich in the burger
business," Mr. Collins sniffs.
   A spokesman for Wendy's, which has 3,750 restaurants, says
the Chick-fil-A distinction between burger eaters and chicken
fans is meaningless because most fast-food buyers visit all
varieties of chains. "No one goes to just a chicken chain,"
he says.
   Chick-fil-A lawyers have taken their challenge to the
three major networks and several cable operators. ABC, NBC
and CBS have given Wendy's until May 1 to further
substantiate its claims, even though the ads finished their
scheduled run March 31.
   Wendy's has yet to respond to the networks' query, and the
company spokesman wouldn't disclose his chain's strategy.
Concludes the Wendy's spokesman: "We've looked at their
research, and we do not believe it's valid on a national
basis."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   BROOKLYN apparently has cachet with Japanese beer
connoisseurs, who are paying $15 a bottle for air-freighted
lager, dated for freshness, from the Brooklyn Brewery, a
two-year-old micro brewery in New York. . . . Arm &amp; Hammer
researchers claim yet another use for baking soda: When
dumped down incinerator ducts, the powder neutralizes
pollutants that cause acid rain.
