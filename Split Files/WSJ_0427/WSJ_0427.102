   The pleas for "coordination" of economic policies being
made by finance ministers of the world's leading countries
are not convincing. What these helmsmen don't seem to
understand is that their economies are already coordinated.
The role of national governments is much less important than
they think; governments are little more than spoilers who
disrupt markets with their interference and announcements.
   The economic coordination isn't perfect. Some resources
(money) are mobile, others (jobs) are not. Some industries
are global (autos), others (many services) are not. Moreover,
some regions of individual countries are more coordinated
than others because of local trade and investment patterns.

   Despite these imperfections, the most fundamental truth of
today's economic world is this: Man's ability to create,
compete and consume will not be denied by those politicians
and bureaucrats who try to restrict the flows of capital,
technology and information. This is a lesson not only for
Eastern European communists, but Japanese and American
nationalists.
   The two traditional "products" of governments -- military
protection and access to natural resources -- are losing
their value. Commodities can be arbitraged across producing
countries, and if you have the wealth to buy these
commodities you certainly have access to them. Just 10 years
ago, during the second energy crisis, we were worried about
the supply of primary commodities and resources. We don't
worry so much today. The price of energy might rise, but
innovative products or services can produce much higher
per-capita GNP than natural resources. Switzerland, for
example, doesn't even have a flat stretch of land, yet it has
a $25,000 per-capita GNP, the world's highest.
   Thus, there is diminishing need for military power to
protect a country's "scarce" resources. Moreover, no amount
of military power can make a people more productive. An
educated populace with free access to information is the
truest source of wealth and national security. That's the
reality that brought down the Berlin Wall and is the
fundamental reason the world needs less military muscle.
   Besides military forces, another benefit governments offer
their people is ideology. With their taxes, people pay for
the "truth." But Cable News Network and the tales of the good
life it spreads throughout the world have made standards of
living, not political dogma, the criteria by which
governments are judged. Communism, Japanism, Monroeism are
merely packaging for this "core product."
   Government "advertising" -- which basically asks people to
pay for dogma -- no longer sells. People want the best goods
and services, whatever their origin. Along with the right to
vote, they want the right to buy.
   So governments must deliver standards of living in this
new market for political control. Some politicians think they
can do that on a national basis. They are wrong. National
standards of living have always hidden disparities in well
being -- disparities between families and between regions.
The dirty little truth is that politicians rob other regions
to buy votes in their own. But global competition is making
these larcenies more obvious.
   If, for example, a government protects its steel industry
with tariffs, other steel-intensive industries in that
country, or their customers, suffer because of the higher
prices they must pay. Now that markets are global,
cross-regional transfers result not only in a loss of profits
and higher prices, but in lost jobs as national companies
lose to foreign competition.
   Multinationals in the late '60s and early '70s were
structured more or less according to a hierarchical, colonial
model. Most production was done "at home." Today's global
companies are decentralized and willing to manufacture,
design, or assign managerial authority wherever they can best
serve the customer. The objective of Honda, IBM and other
global firms is to serve customers, not governments,
world-wide.
   Thus we now see as much intranational as international
competition. For North Carolina to prosper, it has to attract
European and Japanese investment. In fact, one-third of
investment in that state over the past two years has come
from Japan. North Carolina is not competing with Japan or
Europe; it is competing with Boston and Silicon Valley for
foreign high-tech investments. Boston is its biggest "enemy"
in this regard. What should Washington do in this contest
except stay out and make sure there is a "level playing
field" between these two competitors -- for example, equal
access to educational grants?
   Japan's economy is just as regional as that of the U.S.
When people talk about Japan's prosperity, they are basically
talking about the prosperity of three cities, Tokyo, Osaka
and Nagoya. The rest of the country is holding on by getting
money from the central government at the expense of urban
taxpayers.
   Like the Meiji Restoration in the second half of the 19th
century, a Heisei Restoration is needed to transform Japan's
government to one more suitable for a developed country in a
global economy. Japan needs a new constitution that would
divide the country into nine or 10 regions, each with some
degree of autonomy. These regions would be able to negotiate
with foreign nations on matters such as air rights and
immigration.
   The governor of the northern island of Hokkaido, for
instance, would declare independence from Tokyo. He would
abolish its 3:30 a.m. sunrise based on Japan standard time
and open stock trading two hours earlier than Tokyo. Sapporo
would then attract all the financial institutions now in
Tokyo, Sydney and Wellington. And, because Sapporo would be
able to negotiate air rights with foreign governments, it
would become a hub for transpacific flights. It would also
have direct flights to Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong and other
major cities in the Pacific. Hokkaido, with its beautiful
lakes and mountains, would become the Switzerland of Asia.
   Centrally governed countries such as Japan, the Soviet
Union and China will have to go through turmoil that in the
long run will be good for them. The solution is to
reconstruct on a regional basis. In order to modernize, China
must create 20 "Singapores." To a lesser extent, but still in
the same fundamental way, America must continue to allow each
region to integrate itself into the world economy elsewhere.
   Most politicians are still living in the 19th century. In
Japan, for example, most politicans come from small towns and
try to promote a concept of narrow regionalism. They ask one
region to make sacrifices in the name of "national" interest.
They say they can protect the rice farmers from foreign
pressure and build bridges and gymnasiums with the central
government's money. They use voters' nationalistic feelings
to funnel money into special interest groups or their own
constituencies.
   Nowhere is this hypocrisy more clear than in Japan-U.S.
trade talks, which take on artificial nationalistic overtones
when in truth they are battles among special interests. Whose
interest are being represented by the negotiators? America's?
Japan's?
   Only a global regionalism that ignores national boundaries
makes sense. Local communities will develop natural partners,
sometimes close geographically, sometimes remote. Through
these pairings, alert regions with global views and
aspirations will develop and prosper, the same way that alert
companies with a global perspective are already prospering.
For example, Southern California can flourish through its
ties with Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- not so
much through its ties with Washington, D.C., New York or
Chicago. Similarly, Toronto and Vancouver can flourish
because of their ties with Hong Kong and Wales and, more
recently, Alsace-Lorraine can flourish through investments
from Tokyo, etc.
   If I had my way, I'd pay a third of my taxes to an
international fund dedicated to solving world problems, such
as the environment and famine. Another third would go to my
community, where my family lives and my children are
educated. The final third would go to my country, which each
year does less and less for me in terms of security or
well-being and instead subsidizes special interests.
   The role of government in a borderless world is to
represent and protect the interests of its people, not of its
companies or its industries. It should let in the light and
then allow its people to make their own choices. Anything
less is to put the class and career interests of government
bureaucrats ahead of the people they are sworn to serve.
