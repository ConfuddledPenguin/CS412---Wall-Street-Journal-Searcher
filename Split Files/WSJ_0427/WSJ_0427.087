   WASHINGTON -- In a major concession to congressional
budget-cutters, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed
building only 75 of the 132 B-2 Stealth bombers originally
envisioned by the Pentagon, and he urged significant cuts in
two other expensive aircraft projects.
   Intended to save $35 billion over the next eight years,
Mr. Cheney's long-awaited recommendations would involve
cutting to 120 planes from 210 the Air Force's planned fleet
of C-17 troop transports. In addition, the defense secretary
proposed stretching out development and reducing production
rates for the next generation of high-performance Navy and
Air Force jet fighters.

   Mr. Cheney told lawmakers that a major factor in his
proposal to scale back fighter production plans was his
"preliminary" decision to reduce the number of Navy aircraft
carriers to 12 from the current 14 over the next few years.
He also said, "There's no question we're going to have a
smaller Air Force" by that time, although he didn't provide
any specifics.
   But the proposals clearly won't satisfy increasingly
powerful congressional critics, who are demanding deeper cuts
in Pentagon spending and outright termination of one of the
high-technology airplanes. By "cutting a little bit and
stretching a lot, you drive up the {unit} cost on virtually
all of the programs," complained Rep. John Kasich (R., Ohio),
a leader of a bipartisan coalition to kill the radar-eluding
B-2 bomber.
   Testifying in back-to-back hearings of the House and
Senate Armed Services Committees yesterday, Mr. Cheney
acknowledged that his plan would trim only about $2.4 billion
from the Pentagon's request for $306.9 billion in spending
authority for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But the
proposal represents the opening volley in what promises to be
an emotional and drawn-out battle between lawmakers and the
Bush administration over the shape of military aviation into
the 21st century.
   While the cuts proposed by Mr. Cheney were severe, they
weren't as deep as many defense contractors had feared.
Northrop Corp., which builds the B-2, greeted Mr. Cheney's
recommendations with sighs of relief. B-2 spending still
would reach about $6 billion a year when production gets into
full swing. And compared with some proposals inside and
outside the Pentagon to gut the program by buying only 15 or
30 of the bat-winged planes, "75 aircraft is nothing to
sneeze at," said Les Daly, a senior Northrop vice president.
   Industry officials also were pleased that the program
involving the largest number of contractors, the Air Force's
$60 billion-plus Advanced Tactical Fighter program, would be
delayed by two years but otherwise would come through
unscathed. "Talk about joy in heaven," said James Blackwell,
vice president and general manager of the ATF office at
Lockheed Corp, which is teamed on the program with Boeing Co.
and General Dynamics Corp. The other team bidding for the
fighter contract includes Northrop and McDonnell Douglas
Corp.
   Still, Mr. Blackwell acknowledged that "there will be a
lot of presidents and a lot of Congresses to get through"
before ATF production reaches robust rates.
   Mr. Cheney seems to be driven more by domestic political
and fiscal pressures to reduce U.S. defense spending than by
any fundamental reassessment of Soviet military capabilities.
He testified that the U.S. intelligence community still
expects Kremlin leaders to deploy potent new supersonic
fighters and sophisticated air defense systems over the next
decade or so, although the improvements are bound to be
slower than expected as a result of serious economic problems
in the Soviet Union.
   House Armed Services Committee chairman Les Aspin (D.,
Wis.) said Mr. Cheney's proposals were "still based on an
unrealistically pessimistic view of the Soviet threat" and an
optimistic reading of how much Congress is willing to spend
on defense. "I think he's in trouble on both counts," Rep.
Aspin told reporters.
   In his testimony, Mr. Cheney strongly suggested that he
may have to propose deeper cuts later this year, when the
Pentagon submits its revised long-term spending blueprint to
Congress. If lawmakers reject the administration's military
spending plans, he said, "I'm going to come back with even
tougher calls."
   Up to a few hours before the proposal was released, Mr.
Cheney personally supervised last-minute revisions. The
conclusions were so tightly held that congressional leaders
didn't receive any advance briefings, and even the civilian
chiefs of each of the services didn't review the final
document until yesterday morning.
   Here are highlights of Mr. Cheney's proposed cutbacks:
                                                                                                       

   B-2 STEALTH BOMBER: By proposing to slash B-2 production
more than 40% in order to make the beleaguered project more
palatable to lawmakers, Mr. Cheney risks pushing the total
cost of each plane above $800 million, compared with current
estimates of $530 million. The Pentagon now wants Northrop to
build only 12 planes a year at the height of the program,
instead of producing the 24 it envisioned previously.
   As recently as last week, some top Pentagon officials were
talking about building 100 B-2s, using that higher figure as
a bargaining chip. Mr Cheney said he is convinced that a
75-plane fleet is "about as low as you can go . . . and still
have a significant amount of capability" against Soviet air
defenses.
   The fate of the B-2 program is all-important to Los
Angeles-based Northrop, which derives about half its revenue,
or some $2.5 billion a year, from the plane. Northrop's Mr.
Daly said that Mr. Cheney's plan, besides reducing Northrop's
own anticipated revenues, could have a ripple effect on the
number of employees at thousands of subcontractors working on
the Stealth program. But he maintained that Northrop still
would be able to rid itself of its $880 million in debt by
the mid-1990s, as it has been planning.
   Mr. Daly insisted that Northrop's profit margins on the
program wouldn't be affected by Mr. Cheney's proposals
because under the terms of its contract, the government meets
all fixed costs, no matter what the production rate. In
recent interviews, top corporate finance officials also have
stressed that the Pentagon reimburses Northrop for most of
its variable costs, as well as the added interest expense it
must endure because of a stretch-out in production.
   Still, many on Capitol Hill believe that even 75 planes
will prove to be an elusive dream. They said Mr. Cheney
himself didn't appear firmly wedded to building that many
B-2s. "It's the whole tone," said one top Senate Republican
aide. "Cheney really didn't come over and say, `We have to
have that.'"
                                                                                                       

   C-17 TRANSPORT: McDonnell Douglas's C-17s originally were
intended to substantially increase the capacity of the U.S.
to move large numbers of troops to Europe in case of a land
war with the Soviets. Mr. Cheney's proposal to cut the
proposed fleet back by nearly 50% would result in a maximum
production rate of 24 planes a year, compared with the 29
envisioned earlier, and would set a much less ambitious
mission for the new aircraft: simply replacing aging C-141
cargo carriers.
   McDonnell Douglas, with its wide-ranging operations, isn't
as dependent on the C-17 as Northrop is on the Stealth. And
even if the project is cut further on Capitol Hill, the
company could take the 1.65 million square feet of factory
space it has added to its Long Beach, Calif., facilities for
production of the giant transport and use it to manufacture
commercial jetliners.
   Nonetheless, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas has
invested more than $500 million in the C-17, is eking out
about $8 million in profit per quarter on the program and is
counting on the cargo plane to help it maintain a healthy
balance between Pentagon contracts and non-defense work. Bob
Clepper, the company's C-17 program manager, said in a recent
interview that if McDonnell Douglas can't build at least 20
aircraft a year, it will be difficult to maintain efficiency
and keep costs down. "All of our facilities have been scoped
out with the intention of producing 29 a year," Mr. Clepper
said.
                                                                                                       

   ADVANCED FIGHTERS: Calling the Navy's A-12 attack plane
one of the military's "most urgent requirements," Mr. Cheney
made it clear he is determined to push ahead with the
program, although at a somewhat reduced rate.
   At one point in his testimony, Mr. Cheney disclosed
previously classified details about the A-12, including that
the program has a price tag of about $52 billion.
   General Dynamics, which along with McDonnell Douglas
builds the plane, said in a statement that it was "pleased
that the A-12 requirement has been reaffirmed along with the
funding and planning for the early years of the program." The
first A-12 is supposed to be rolled out of an Air Force plant
in Oklahoma this fall.
   However, production of the Air Force's version of the
fighter, called the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, would be
scratched completely from the Defense Department's 1992-1997
spending blueprint.
   By contrast, Mr. Cheney's decision to preserve the Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter is welcome news to the two
teams of contractors, which together have invested more than
$1.2 billion to design the two-engine, supersonic fighter.
Mr. Cheney's plans would retain a naval version of the ATF,
but delay deployment of that aircraft until 1998. In an
ironic twist, the defense chief acknowledged that the delay
could force the Pentagon to keep buying Grumman Corp.'s F-14
fighter, a plane he lobbied hard to kill last year.
