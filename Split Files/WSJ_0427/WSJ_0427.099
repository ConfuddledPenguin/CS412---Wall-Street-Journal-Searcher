   TORONTO -- By most appearances, Northern Telecom Ltd.'s
chief executive officer, Paul G. Stern, turned in a strong
performance in 1989, his first year at the helm. On Tuesday,
the telecommunications equipment company reported a healthy
first quarter as well, aided by a cost-cutting and
restructuring program.
   Profit rose 50% to $74 million, or 30 cents a share,
against $47 million, or 20 cents a share, in the year-earlier
first quarter, the company said. Revenue climbed 14% to $1.6
billion and orders and order backlog topped last year's
period by 13% to $1.5 billion and $1.87 billion,
respectively.

   But Mr. Stern, in an effort he vaguely refers to as Vision
2000, wants Northern to grow to $30 billion in annual revenue
in 10 years -- five times current sales. To make it, Northern
will need more than the phone switches that boosted its
results in the 1980s. It also must improve its international
performance and capture about 10% of the projected $300
billion market for switching and transmission systems.
   "By (Vision 2000) we mean, `What do we want to be when we
grow up?'" Mr. Stern says. "How do we establish leadership?"
   In the late 1970s, Northern used its trend-setting office
phone switches and DMS-10 digital switch for phone companies
to venture beyond its parochial Canadian perch and beat
mighty American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. in its own market.
Northern now holds close to one third of the $10 billion U.S.
market for digital switches, according to Northern Business
Information Inc., an unrelated Manhattan-based research firm.
   Now the U.S. switch market is maturing, and Mr. Stern is
trying to expand his transmission business -- an area that
AT&amp;T dominates with a 52% share, compared with Northern's 6%,
according to Northern Business Information. He also wants a
bigger share of the market outside North America. Northern
Telecom currently derives about 10% of its business from
foreign customers such as Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp.,
Turkey's telephone administration, British Telecom PLC and
European corporate and banking customers of its office phone
and data networking systems.
   To do this, Northern is trying to boost orders for its
switches overseas. And it's pushing a line of fiber-optic
transmission systems and a network design concept called
Fiber World.
   Northern unveiled its line of fiber-optic systems before
rivals such as AT&amp;T, Rockwell International Inc. and Japan's
NEC Corp. "Invariably, {customers} buy a product because a
supplier has a uniqueness," Mr. Stern says. "When you're
first, the perception lingers."
   Perhaps. But on numerous other key products, Northern
hasn't been the first to market for some time, says Maria
Lewis, an analyst at Shearson Lehman. She notes that much of
the equipment market is moving toward mobile communications,
a market to which Northern paid little attention before
rivals such as Sweden's AB Ericsson, Motorola Inc. and
Japanese suppliers moved in to dominate it.
   "Northern got lucky in 1989 from cost-cutting and from
selling upgraded processors for existing switches -- a
business that's not going to be around to the same extent in
1990," said Ms. Lewis. "Stern has to improve Northern's
fiber-optics penetration. There's no place else for him to
go."
   Mr. Stern, who yesterday added the title of chairman when
he took over from the retiring Edmund B. Fitzgerald, says the
Fiber World program is "going fine." But he says it's too
early to tell how sales will stack up this year, since
customers such as MCI Communications Corp. and Bell Atlantic
Corp. are just beginning to install and test the systems in
their networks.
   Nobody questions Mr. Stern's talent. A hard-nosed
operations expert, he works 15-hour days, and previously held
upper-management jobs in some of the world's largest
corporations, including International Business Machines Corp.
and Unisys Corp. As a director of Northern Telecom, he became
intimately familiar with the company's operations and, in
1988 was coaxed out of early retirement to save the company
from itself.
   In nine months as president and chief executive he
accelerated Northern's restructuring program, shutting four
of 47 plants, selling a fifth facility to employees and
cutting 2,500 jobs. He even changed the bonus system, tying
employee incentives in each business unit to the
corporation's performance.
   Mr. Stern also reshuffled management, bringing in a new
chief financial officer, Martin Mand, from Du Pont Co., and
shifting President David Vice to vice chairman in charge of
products and technology.
   The results were a paring of Northern's expenses in 1989
to 18.5% of revenues from 20.1% the year before. In addition,
profit soared 18% on a 13% increase in sales in 1989.
   Mr. Stern says: "It was a very tough year, not in the
marketplace, but on all our people. The pace of change was
very fast." And not likely to slow down anytime soon.
