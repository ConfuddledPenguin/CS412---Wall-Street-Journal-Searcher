   Is a United States of Europe in the making? We will
believe it when we see it.
   After all, the Magna Carta, Elizabeth I, Peel, Gladstone,
Churchill: Is the grand history of British governance really
going to end in a bureaucrat's office in Brussels? Colbert,
Napoleon and de Gaulle: Is the glorious tradition of French
sovereignty also about to culminate in some boxlike room in
the Berlaymont? Does German history also end in that squat,
graceless building by the Schuman metro station? Were Rome,
Athens and Madrid all meant to be mere bureaucratic outposts
of a new European capital in Brussels?

   Some of those who will gather in Dublin this weekend for a
special European summit seem to think all this will come to
pass. The French and Germans claim they want a United States
of Europe up and running by January 1, 1993.
   The European Community's steps toward a single market and
monetary union were efforts to adapt to the emergence of a
global economy. But the talk of political union is less
focused and purposeful. It is mainly designed to send
foreign-policy signals. At the moment, the Germans are
primarily interested in reunification. Being ultra-European
is a way of indicating that a united Germany won't be a
threat to its neighbors. The French want to further
Franco-German relations, while trying to ensure that a
reunited Germany is a Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputian
directives emanating from the French-style bureaucracy in
Brussels.
   The British are reacting hesitantly as they always have
when a pan-European scheme emerged from France or Germany.
The small countries will join in if the price is right.
   In other words, the nations of Europe continue to act as
distinct nation-states, as distinct peoples, setting up
alliances when possible, but concerned above all with their
own national power and security.
   We can't help noticing that in the very week that Francois
Mitterrand scaled the rhetorical heights to declare that
Europe should be one, France banned a British airline from
charging more than $100 less than Air France on flights
between London and Paris.
   Though Helmut Kohl can be vague and eloquent about a
United States of Europe, his country has just slapped a
unilateral tax on all foreign trucks traveling on German
roads. It takes effect this July.
   The practitioners of symbolic diplomacy dismiss such
observations as small talk. It sends a "frisson" of delight
up certain European spines to imagine a common European home
that could stand up to the U.S., Japan and U.S.S.R. We are
not opposed to grand visions, and Europe's attempts to erase
ancient hostilities are welcome. But we would be more
comfortable if the ringing declarations sounded less hollow.
   Even the much advertised "1992" economic union will fall
far short of its billing. The Eurocrats will have to agree on
279 directives before unification is complete. Having cleared
away the easy decisions, they now face the hard ones, many of
which require unanimous support from the 12 nations. They
already have stalled on some big ones, notably those
concerning taxes. For 20 years, they have worked on
harmonizing direct company taxation with little to show for
their efforts. This month the EC commission scaled back its
ambitions, hoping that countries will at least come to
"mutual recognition" of tax policies of other members.
   Of the 158 directives that have been drafted by the EC, a
mere 21 have been enacted in all the member countries. As
with U.N. resolutions, member states feel free to delay or
ignore EC decisions. The much-criticized British actually
lead the way in implementing EC directives, a fact which they
remind their listeners of every five seconds or so. Italy has
so far ignored 51 of the directives.
   Idealists believe that slapping a quasi-governmental
structure on top of diverse states will ensure peace and
cooperation. The goal is worthy, but the U.N. has amply
demonstrated that more than an organizational edifice is
necessary.
   Centuries of European political philosophers have explored
the organic relationship between a people and its government.
If a government is not of a people, as well as for it, you
have at best a useless bureaucracy, and at worst a
dictatorship of a technocratic elite. If Messrs. Mitterrand
and Kohl really envision a European government of the people,
we need to hear more about how that is to be achieved.
   The Dublin summit would benefit from less vague talk about
"political unity" and more about whether the goal is to move
government closer to the people, or further away.
