   Government officials talk a lot about how to keep jobs in
slum areas, but this story shows that the concern is often
little more than sentimental talk. Take the 3,500 workers at
the Brach Candy Co. plant on Chicago's impoverished West
Side. They may all lose their jobs because the government
won't let their plant escape import quotas that force it to
pay inflated prices for the sugar it uses.
   The Brach's plant has been producing candy since 1924, but
it lost $50 million last year because of aging equipment and
high labor costs. Its new owner, the Swiss firm of Jacobs
Suchard, has spent $44 million to modernize the facility, but
an extra $100 million will be needed to bring it up to
standard. The problem is a federal import quota that helps
the 11,000 U.S. sugar growers keep out cheap foreign sugar.
The quota costs U.S. consumers at least $3 billion a year,
and it forces Brach's to pay 24 cents a pound for sugar
rather than the world price of 15 cents.

   The extra money goes into the pockets of sugar growers.
The Agriculture Department estimates the average sugar-cane
farmer received $235,000 in annual subsidies between 1987 and
1989.
   Brach's says that if it can't cut its sugar costs it will
probably have to close the plant and move to either Canada or
Mexico. In Canada it could buy sugar at the world price, and
then ship candy to the U.S. almost tariff free. In Mexico it
would save millions on labor costs. Brach's wants to stay in
the U.S., so it has asked the federal government to add the
plant to a list of 260 designated foreign trade zones, most
of which are in depressed areas. That would allow Brach's to
buy sugar at the world price, save $20 million a year and
secure the 3,500 jobs of its largely black work force.
   The Bush Agriculture Department says it is appalled at the
extravagantly wasteful sugar program, and last week announced
it was declaring war on a House agriculture subcommittee's
effort to raise sugar subsidies even higher. However, it has
decided to oppose Brach's plea for a free trade zone because
it feels obliged to defend the present law. "If you approve
one, you'd have to approve everyone who applied," says John
Nuttall, head of USDA's sugar program. "You end up with a
disruption of the sugar price support program."
   The final decision will be made by the Foreign Trade Zones
Board, chaired by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. On
Monday, a Commerce Department examiner recommended that the
Brach's request be denied. The full board will review the
issue within a few weeks.
   We understand the Bush Administration's desire to use the
coming GATT trade talks to negotiate a reduction in sugar
subsidies rather than provoke a confrontation with Congress.
But the workers at the Brach's plant in Chicago can't wait.
Nearly a quarter of the jobs in the area have disappeared in
the past decade, and theirs could be next.
   Exempting Brach's from the sugar quotas might well mean a
flood of similar requests from other companies. Approving
them all would quickly end the sugar program. There would be
shrieks of outrage from the sugar lobby and its allies in
Congress, but the costs of the program would finally be
forced out into the open.
   We'd bet the sugar lobby would have a hard time restoring
the subsidies once the network news pitted images of the
minority workers at the Brach's plant against the prosperous
sugar growers of Hawaii.
