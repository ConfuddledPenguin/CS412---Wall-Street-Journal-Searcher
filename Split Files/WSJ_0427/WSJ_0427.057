   STOCKHOLM -- Having restored calm in Saab-Scania AB's
boardroom, Sweden's Wallenberg group is bracing for a giant,
expensive step into Europe by another of its corporate
prizes, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB.
   Stockholm markets were filled with questions yesterday
about Saab-Scania's future following Wednesday's 4.3 billion
kronor ($707.3 million) option accord between the Wallenbergs
and Stockholm property tycoon Sven-Olof Johansson. If
exercised later this year, the pact would allow the
Wallenbergs to dispose of a big, unwelcome minority holder
while lifting their Saab-Scania voting stake to 58% from 36%.

   Wallenberg group officials said they have no plans at the
moment to raise their stake further -- and might even sell
some of the shares they expect to buy from Mr. Johansson. But
the price of Saab-Scania shares rebounded yesterday on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange after falling sharply on Wednesday.
Analysts attributed the recovery to speculation the
Wallenbergs might be preparing to take the automobile and
aerospace concern private in Sweden's biggest ever leveraged
buy-out.
   Meanwhile Stora, one of Europe's biggest forestry
concerns, moved closer to an agreement to acquire Feldmuehle
Nobel AG, the West German paper, chemicals and engineering
group. Trading in Feldmuehle Nobel shares was halted
yesterday on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. People familiar
with the negotiations said an agreement valuing the West
German concern at about 4 billion German marks ($2.38
billion) could be announced as early as today.
   A spokesman for Veba AG, Feldmuehle Nobel's dominant
shareholders with a 50.01% stake, confirmed it had held
simultaneous talks in recent weeks with Stora and Svenska
Cellulosa AB, another big Swedish suitor. Svenska Cellulosa
dropped out of the race on Wednesday and announced it had
sold its 5% Feldmuehle Nobel holding.
   Svenska Cellulosa officials said they withdrew because the
price demanded for Feldmuehle Nobel was too high. The Veba
spokesman said price wasn't the only issue on which it failed
to agree with Svenska Cellulosa. Others close to the talks
said Svenska Cellulosa's bid collapsed because it balked at
acquiring Feldmuehle Nobel's other operations along with its
paper unit.
   Industry analysts suggested Stora would have less
difficulty disposing of Feldmuehle Nobel's non-paper
businesses -- perhaps by merging them with other Wallenberg
affiliates. And though Svenska Cellulosa grabbed an early
lead in the contest for Feldmuehle Nobel, Stora maintained an
inside track because of its longtime cooperation with the
West German concern in production of both newsprint and pulp,
the raw material from which paper is made.
