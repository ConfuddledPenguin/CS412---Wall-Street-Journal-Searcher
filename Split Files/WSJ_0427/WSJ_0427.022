   Colleges giving credit
   For life experience,
   To me is a concept
   That makes good sense.
   For my current life style,
   With loads of frustration,
   Qualifies me for a degree
   As a Bachelor of Aggravation.

   I give my love a greeting card,
   (The work of some creative staff);
   Immediately she scans the back:
   "It cost a dollar and a half]"
