   CHICAGO -- A federal court threw out the primary count of
a farmer group's suit alleging that the Chicago Board of
Trade acted illegally last summer when it ordered Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A to sell much of its soybean holdings.
   The July order, made in an effort to block the Italian
conglomerate from what board officials have argued was an
attempt to corner the soybean market, sent soybean prices
plunging.

   The farmer group, known as American Agriculture Movement,
said in a November suit that CBOT "manipulation" of the price
caused damages of more than $100 million.
   The court said in its ruling that the board's action
didn't violate the Commodities Exchange Act. It also said it
found "persuasive" the CBOT's arguments to have the remaining
three counts dismissed, but the court said a different legal
move -- a request for a summary judgment as opposed to the
motion for dismissal -- would be required. The remaining
counts allege CBOT violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and
other common-law strictures. American Agriculture Movement
couldn't be reached for comment.
   The CBOT's July action has already been reviewed and
cleared by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
