   Your report on the Art Buchwald-Paramount Pictures Corp.
legal battle concerning the motion picture "Coming to
America" (March 21) may mislead the reader by your saying
Paramount was "taking in revenue of $275 million world-wide."
Paramount did not take in this money. The motion-picture
exhibitors did (i.e. "box-office gross"). Paramount took its
share of that gross ("rentals" or "distributor's gross"),
which is usually less than 50% of the box-office gross -- in
this case $125 million.
