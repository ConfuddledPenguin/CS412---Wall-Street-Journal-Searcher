   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.

   FHP INTERNATIONAL Corp.'s recently reported fiscal third
quarter earnings of 35 cents a share were about in line with
analysts' average estimate of 34 cents a share. Because the
estimate was incorrect in Thursday's Quarterly Earnings
Surprises table, due to a database error at Zacks Investment
Research, the company's results shouldn't have been included
among negative surprises.
