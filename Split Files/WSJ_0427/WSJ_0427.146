   MEI Diversified Inc., a Minneapolis-based snack and
health-food distributor, said it agreed to sell substantially
all of the assets of its candy and snack group to Ezaki Glico
Co. of Osaka, Japan, for $58 million.
   The sale of the unprofitable operation, which had 1989
sales of $107 million, marks MEI's planned departure from the
candy and snack business, the company said. MEI is "moving
into new directions," a spokesman said. MEI has been seeking
to expand into other fields, and last October agreed to buy
LecTec Corp., a Minneapolis-based medical products maker, for
about $17.6 million; that transaction is pending.

   The sale of the candy and snack group, which is expected
to be completed by May 31, won't result in a gain, because
the purchase price approximates the book value of the assets
being sold, the spokesman said. MEI's major shareholders are
the investors Carl Pohlad and Irwin Jacobs.
