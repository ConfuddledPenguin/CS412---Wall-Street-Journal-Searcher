   The U.S. Transportation Department granted Continental
Airlines, a unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., authority
to fly passengers and cargo between Houston and Tokyo.
   The agency also gave final approval to the sale by Eastern
Airlines, another Texas Air unit, of its Latin American
routes to American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth,
Texas.

   Continental has said it expects to earn $25 million a year
from the Houston-Tokyo route. The route calls for a stopover
in Honolulu, which also gives Continental a chance to compete
for Honolulu-Tokyo travelers. About 40% of U.S. traffic to
Tokyo flies through Honolulu. Continental said it will begin
flying the route daily on July 2.
   The department's decision is unrelated to a U.S.-Japan
route case that will greatly expand service to Asia. In that
case, which won't be decided until the fall, nine U.S.
carriers are competing for six new routes to Japan -- three
to Tokyo and three to other Japanese cities.
   The route authority granted to Continental once belonged
to Federal Express Corp., Memphis, Tenn., which had to
relinquish it because Flying Tiger Line, acquired by Federal
Express, already had a U.S.-Japan route. The Transportation
Department had said it would allow the succeeding carrier to
fly passengers, as well.
   One reason that Continental was chosen over five rivals
was that it proposed service without a plane change to
Houston, the only one of the nation's four largest cities
that doesn't have single-plane service to Tokyo, said Patrick
Murphy, the Transportation Department's deputy assistant
secretary for policy and international affairs. The other
candidates were American Airlines, Delta Air Lines of
Atlanta, the Aloha Airlines unit of Aloha Airgroup Inc. of
Honolulu, America West Airlines of Phoenix, Ariz., and the
Hawaiian Airlines unit of HAL Inc., Honolulu.
   In approving the transfer of Eastern's routes to American,
the department concluded that the sale is in the public
interest and won't conflict with aviation policy objectives.
   The agency's approval is the last hurdle for the
transaction, which will add $349 million to Eastern's
bankruptcy-law reorganization efforts. Eastern and American
have tentatively scheduled July 1 as the date American will
begin flying the routes.
   The department also approved the sale to American of
Eastern's Miami-Madrid route and of Continental's
Miami-London certificate. But the agency refused for now to
approve the sale of Eastern's Miami/Tampa-Toronto route to
American. It said it will begin a review to determine whether
American or another carrier should be given the authority.
