   FPL GROUP Inc. (North Palm Beach, Fla.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on this
utility holding company's Florida Power &amp; Light Co. and FPL
Group Capital Inc. subsidiaries. The rating concern said
about $4.8 billion of securities are affected. Moody's said
the changes stem from Florida Power's larger construction
program estimated for the 1990-1994 period, increased
financing and rate-relief requirements, and expected lower
internal cash generation. Ratings downgraded include Florida
Power's first mortgage and secured pollution-control revenue
bonds to single-A-2 from double-A-3; shelf registration of
first mortgage bonds to preliminary single-A-2 from
preliminary double-A-3; preferred stock to single-A-2 from
double-A-3; shelf registration of preferred stock to
preliminary single-A-2 from preliminary double-A-3; and
unsecured pollution control revenue bonds to single-A-3 from
single-A-1. Florida Power's prime-1 rating for commercial
paper remains unchanged. FPL Group Capital ratings lowered
include medium-term notes to Baa-1 from single-A-2; shelf
registration of medium-term notes to preliminary Baa-1 from
preliminary single-A-2; and commercial paper to prime-2 from
prime-1.
