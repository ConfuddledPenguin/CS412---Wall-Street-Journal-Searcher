   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson &amp; Johnson boosted its
dividend 17% and reported that first-quarter net income fell
23% because of a charge related to economic turmoil in Latin
America.
   Net income at the health products concern fell to $244
million, or 73 cents a share, from $317 million, or 95 cents
a share, a year earlier. The $125 million, or
38-cent-a-share, charge included provisions for writing down
and restructuring units in Argentina and for paying
additional interest on now-liquidated debt in that country.
Sales rose 16% to $2.84 billion from $2.45 billion.
