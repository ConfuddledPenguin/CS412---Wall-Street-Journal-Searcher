   TORTURE IN CHINA

   Human-rights groups said torture and ill-treatment of
prisoners had increased in China since the suppression of
last year's pro-democracy movement.
   Cattle prods were widely used, prisoners were held
incommunicado for months and conditions in prisons and labor
camps throughout the country were appalling, representatives
of human-rights organizations and of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions said. They said they had
documented cases from former inmates of beatings to extract
confessions.
   China is to present a report to the United Nations
Committee Against Torture today. The report cites a number of
laws making torture illegal and punishable although it
concedes the practice has yet to be eradicated completely.
   A report by the New York-based International League for
Human Rights said the problem had worsened since China
ratified the 1984 Convention Against Torture two years ago.
"During the years 1985-88 there was a vigorous press campaign
which exposed many cases of torture but since the June 1989
crackdown such accounts have disappeared," the league report
said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW CHARGE IN IMHAUSEN CASE
                                                                                                       

   The public prosecutor's office in Mannheim, West Germany,
said it is filing charges of tax evasion against Juergen
Hippenstiel-Imhausen involving money allegedly received for
helping plan and build a chemical-weapons plant in Libya. The
indictment is the second against the former president of
Imhausen-Chemie G.m.b.H. He was charged last month with
violating West German export-control laws by shipping via his
company embargoed technology to the Rabta plant, which the
Libyans had said was a pharmaceuticals facility.
                                                                                                       

   UGANDA TO OUTLAW PROSTITUTION
                                                                                                       

   Uganda plans to outlaw prostitution, ban sex under the age
of 18 and increase the penalty for rape in a bid to control
AIDS. The nation has 12,444 confirmed AIDS cases. A law to be
discussed in parliament next week would impose seven-year
jail terms for prostitution and underage sex in a country
where there is now no legal age of consent. It would increase
the maximum penalty for rape to life imprisonment from seven
years.
                                                                                                       

   NOMURA'S BERLIN PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nomura Securities Co. will become a member of the
Berlin Stock Exchange early next month. A Nomura spokesman
said that by joining the exchange the company hopes to tap
business opportunities expected to be created by the
unification of West and East Germany. Nomura already is a
member of exchanges in Frankfurt and Munich.
                                                                                                       

   SOME BOAT PEOPLE GO HOME
                                                                                                       

   A group of 126 Vietnamese boat people left Hong Kong for
Hanoi yesterday under a United Nations-backed voluntary
repatriation program. A total of 1,966 boat people have
returned to Vietnam under guarantees from Hanoi that they
will not be persecuted. The program began in March last year.
Flights carrying about 120 people have been leaving at the
rate of one a week, but officials aim to send 1,000 a month
back by June. Hong Kong has 54,000 Vietnamese boat people
packed in camps and detention centers, most with no hope of
being accorded permanent status under the British colony's
strict refugee-screening process.
                                                                                                       

   HONDA'S FOREIGN-MADE PARTS
   Japan's Honda Motor Co. said it would expand its
procurement of foreign-made auto parts as a result of recent
successful meetings with U.S. parts suppliers. Honda said it
had reached agreements on expanding its procurement of 22
parts from 12 U.S. companies. A spokesman said seven of the
agreements involve products that Honda will be importing for
the first time while the remaining agreements cover expanded
procurement of parts the company is already importing.
                                                                                                       

   WANTED: GERMAN SPEAKERS
                                                                                                       

   Use of the German language is on the rise at the
headquarters of the European Community Commission in
Brussels.
   As German government officials and businessmen call for
making their language more common in conducting commission
business, some French and English speakers at the commission
are starting to worry. While French is still the lingua
franca for most of the commission's business (English is
second), German is catching up. The Brussels Goethe Institute
says enrollment in its German classes has increased 13% this
year.
   As the commission works out plans to bring East Germany
into the EC, much of the groundwork requires German speakers.
The head of the team studying agricultural questions, an
Italian, says he has put mostly Germans on the job to avoid
slowing the work with translations.
   At the EC's daily press briefing, the only language used
is French.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Eton College, the breeding ground of the British
establishment, has begun allowing students to go into
neighboring Windsor wearing jeans and open-necked shirts. The
school had formerly required boys visiting the town to wear
dress trousers, jackets and ties. . . . Morocco's King Hassan
freed 332 prisoners and ordered sentences cut on 112 in a
traditional measure of royal clemency to mark the Moslem
feast of Eid al-Fitr.
