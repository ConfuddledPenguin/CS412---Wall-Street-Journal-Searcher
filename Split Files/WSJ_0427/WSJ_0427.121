   NEW YORK -- Capital appropriations by the nation's largest
manufacturers rose 9.3% in 1989's fourth quarter from the
third quarter, the Conference Board reported.
   The increase followed declines in the second and third
quarters.

   The Conference Board, which surveys the 1,000 largest
manufacturers quarterly, also said that capital spending rose
7.9%, after "sluggish increases" in the prior two quarters.
   Looking ahead, the board said, survey results suggest an
11.2% rise in capital appropriations in 1990, and a 2.6%
increase in capital spending.
   "Capital spending in 1990 will barely keep pace with
economic growth after running significantly ahead of the
country's overall growth for the past several years," said
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. "But in 1991,
capital spending is likely to climb faster than overall
economic growth and may continue rising for a year or two
beyond that."
