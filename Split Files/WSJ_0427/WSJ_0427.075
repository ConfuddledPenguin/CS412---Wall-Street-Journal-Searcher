   U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the assets of
Learjet Corp., a unit of Integrated Resources Inc., to
Bombardier Inc., the companies said.
   Bombardier agreed earlier this month to acquire the
Learjet assets for $75 million. Integrated Resources, a New
York investment concern, is operating under Chapter 11
protection from its creditors.

   Bombardier and Integrated said the sale is expected to
close on or about May 31. Under the sale agreement Bombardier
also will assume Learjet's short-term debt of about $38
million.
   Learjet will be Bombardier's third major aerospace
acquisition since 1986 and will more than double the Montreal
concern's share of the world market for business jets.
   Bombardier is the dominant manufacturer of transit and
passenger rail equipment in North America and a major player
in Europe. Yesterday, on the Montreal Exchange, Bombardier's
Class A stock closed at C$15.375 ($13.25), up 62.5 Canadian
cents; its Class B shares closed at $15.25, up 12.5 Canadian
cents.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Integrated common closed at 25 cents, off 3.25 cents.
   Stephen D. Weinroth, chairman of Integrated, said the
company expects to present to the bankruptcy court in New
York a proposal for the sale of its interest in American Real
Estate Partners L.P. within two to four weeks.
