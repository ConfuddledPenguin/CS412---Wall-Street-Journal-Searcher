   STOCKHOLM -- Swedish tycoon Erik Penser abhors the
limelight but is determined to make Nobel Industries AB, his
flagship company, into one of Sweden's biggest international
concerns.
   Nobel still faces political flak over allegations it paid
bribes to win a $1.3 billion artillery order from India four
years ago. And Mr. Penser has stirred controversy by moving
from Sweden to the United Kingdom and later to Belgium to
keep his vast personal fortune safely beyond the reach of the
voracious Swedish taxman.

   Mr. Penser was elected Nobel's chairman Monday, succeeding
Lars-Erik Thunholm, a 76-year-old Swedish banker. He says
Nobel directors prodded him to take the job "since I'm such a
substantial owner." Indeed, some analysts suggested that with
a 57.6% voting stake in Nobel, Mr. Penser is so dominant that
there were few takers for the chairman's post.
   Nobel has undergone a corporate facelift in recent years,
shedding peripheral businesses and broadening its base
outside Sweden through a flurry of acquisitions. Mr. Penser
also helped clean up Nobel's shaky balance sheet by
consolidating ownership of his corporate empire two years
ago.
   As a result, Nobel today is cash-rich and hungry for a big
acquisition in Europe. Anders Carlbert, chief executive
officer, acknowledges that Nobel is shopping, with the U.K.
the top geographical priority and a consumer-oriented paint
company high on the wish list. And Mr. Carlberg is in a hurry
to succeed before the European Community dismantles its
internal tariff barriers by the end of 1992.
   Past acquisitions raised the proportion of Nobel's sales
outside Sweden to 71% last year from 59% five years earlier.
The arms and ammunition made by the AB Bofors unit still
account for about 25% of sales.
   But faster growth has come in the adhesives and paint
divisions, now Nobel's biggest at about one-third of sales,
and other chemical niches, such as pulp and paper where Nobel
claims world leadership in chlorate, an environmentally
attractive chemical for bleaching of pulp.
   So far this year, Nobel has sold assets valued at 2.2
billion kronor ($360 million). The company announced the
latest step in its restructuring plans last week by engaging
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to find a partner or buyer for the Nobel
plastics division. The division's output of industrial
components, especially auto parts for Swedish car makers AB
Volvo and Saab Scania AB, accounted for 5% of Nobel's 1989
sales but only 3.5% of operating profit.
   Nobel's pretax profit surged 80% last year to 1.68 billion
kronor, buoyed by a big non-recurring gain from a public
offering of shares in its Gamlestaden AB property unit. Mr.
Carlberg told the annual meeting Monday that sales and
operating profit in the first quarter were in line with the
year-earlier period. Nobel hasn't issued an official 1990
forecast for pretax profit.
   Mr. Penser began his career as a stockbroker but built a
corporate empire during Sweden's stock market boom of the
early 1980s. He gained fame as the Swedish market's boldest
gambler, financing his purchases through massive borrowing.
But unlike many corporate raiders in Sweden, Mr. Penser
rarely sold holdings once acquired.
   His biggest success was the 1985 purchase of Kema Nobel
AB, a big chemical group which he merged with Bofors to form
the present Nobel Industries. But as recently as two years
ago, Mr. Penser seemed headed for a debt crunch that
threatened his empire.
   He managed to pull through, though, thanks to some artful
financing and a timely recovery of prices on the Stockholm
Stock Exchange. Yet with Nobel's finances finally back on a
sound footing, many analysts think Mr. Penser may turn more
cautious. His increased visibility as Nobel's chairman may
help add stability to his future role in markets, some
analysts said. "Nobel is still a company surrounded by
questions and as chairman Mr. Penser won't be able to hide
any more. He'll have to take more responsibility answering
questions from the market and from media," said Per Althin,
an analyst at Haeggloeffs &amp; Ponsbach, a Stockholm brokerage
firm.
   Showing greater restraint in financial markets could be a
way for Mr. Penser to muster political support for the role
Nobel hopes to play in an expected restructuring of Sweden's
defense sector. Nobel already has joined forces with Telefon
AB L.M. Ericsson in a defense electronics venture.
   Analysts say further concentration among defense
contractors is likely. Volvo, which is pressing for a key
role in future defense production, has more political clout
than Nobel, a concern for Mr. Carlberg and the company's
management in bargaining with the state.
