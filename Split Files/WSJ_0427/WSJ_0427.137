   Transamerica Corp., whose 10% gain in its finance sector
was offset by flat results or losses in other operations,
said first-quarter net income slipped slightly to $70.3
million, or 88 cents a share, from $70.9 million, or 89 cents
a share.
   The San Francisco-based financial services and insurance
concern said that sales in the quarter ended March 31
increased nearly 2% to $1.63 billion from $1.60 billion.

   Transamerica said earnings improved in its finance
operations, which includes consumer and commercial lending,
leasing and real estate services, but there was some weakness
in other business lines. The company had $5.3 million in
after-tax, weather-related catastrophe insurance losses,
primarily in the personal and commercial divisions, and there
was softness in the marine and recreational-vehicle rental
markets.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Transamerica's shares closed at $34.875, down 37.5
cents.
