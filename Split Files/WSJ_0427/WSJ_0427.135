   TORONTO -- Robert Campeau has worked out a deal to regain
control of his troubled retail and real-estate empire.
   The embattled chairman of Campeau Corp. agreed to pay his
major personal creditor, Montreal-based National Bank of
Canada, 80 million Canadian dollars (US$68.9 million) to
retire C$153 million of personal loans, according to a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
repayment works out to about 52 cents on the dollar.

   Under the agreement, if Mr. Campeau pays C$40 million by
May 31, National Bank will return Campeau securities it
seized from him in January. The bank had registered shares
and convertible debentures representing 18.9 million Campeau
common shares, or a 37.7% fully diluted stake in the company,
when it said that Mr. Campeau had missed interest payments on
the C$153 million of debt.
   The filing didn't indicate the source of Mr. Campeau's
financing for the transaction, or whether he has obtained the
necessary funds. The seizure by National Bank decreased his
fully diluted stake in Campeau to about 21% from 43%.
   If Mr. Campeau regains those securities, he again will be
the largest shareholder in the company. The Reichmann
family's Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. currently has a
38.4% fully diluted interest in Campeau. Olympia &amp; York
officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   The agreement between National Bank and Mr. Campeau also
stipulates that he will pay another C$40 million plus
interest after U.S. bankruptcy courts approve the
restructuring of Campeau's retailing units, Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. Federated and
Allied sought protection from creditors in January under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and it could take
many months for the units to emerge from the proceedings. Mr.
Campeau must make the second C$40 million payment by Jan. 31,
1992 or National Bank will take back C$60.4 million of
Campeau convertible debentures.
   The agreement between National Bank and Mr. Campeau could
mean that he has the funds to settle the loans or has found a
financial backer. A spokesman for the Reichmanns said they
don't have any connection with financing related to Mr.
Campeau's accord with National Bank. Lawyers for Mr. Campeau
and National Bank declined to comment.
   In February, two other Canadian banks sued Mr. Campeau
because he missed payments on personal loans totaling C$39.2
million. Those banks declined to say whether Mr. Campeau has
approached them with a proposal to repay the debt.
   Lawyers close to the banks' court actions against Mr.
Campeau speculated that his agreement with the National Bank
might be an attempt to settle with all the banks for less
than full value of the loans.
   The Campeau securities that National Bank would return to
Mr. Campeau include 13 million common shares, the C$60.4
million of convertible debentures and four million preference
shares. The securities would be held by a holding company
controlled by the Campeau family. Mr. Campeau's stake in the
real estate and retailing concern includes about 3.6 million
shares held in trust for his son Jacques and daughter
Rachelle. Mr. Campeau previously sued them to retain voting
control over the shares. Jacques Campeau didn't know about
the agreement between his father and National Bank, a lawyer
said. Campeau Corp. has about 44.3 million shares
outstanding.
