   MILAN, Italy -- The Italian government plans to clear
today a decree that will abolish the country's remaining
foreign exchange restrictions, a senior government official
said.
   Nino Cristofori, undersecretary of the Council of
Ministers, said the cabinet will discuss completion of the
foreign exchange liberalization at its weekly meeting.

   The move comes two months before the June 30 deadline set
by the European Community Commission to lift all barriers to
international capital flows.
   The decree, which senior monetary sources said is likely
to take effect in two to three weeks, will allow Italians to
open foreign bank accounts and hold foreign currency in
domestic accounts, and it completes a two-year process of
gradual easing of foreign currency controls.
