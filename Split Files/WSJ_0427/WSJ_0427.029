   LONDON -- The pan-European stock market is proving an
elusive dream.
   Europe's major exchanges agree there should be one market
in the big European stocks to provide greater liquidity and
efficiency. But they disagree over how to create it.

   The efforts have been slow, piecemeal and contradictory.
This is increasingly helping London's aggressive
International Stock Exchange dominate the European financial
centers.
   Europe has 39 national and major regional stock exchanges
trading about 300 major European stocks.
   Fragmented and structurally diverse, they not only compete
with each other but with less formal trading systems composed
of telephone links and computerized videoscreen networks.
   Moreover, they soon will face competition from the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations. The U.S. screen-based, over-the-counter market
plans to begin operating during European hours in the third
quarter.
   The demand for a pan-European market comes from big
international institutional investors who want to trade in
Europe's stocks in a single market within the European time
zone.
   Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of London's exchange, a year
ago said the answer was a Europe-wide screen-based trading
system, which London has.
   Addressing a conference in Frankfurt last month, Mr. Hugh
Smith proposed a joint initiative by London and the German
Federation of Stock Exchanges as "the critical mass, the
focus, upon which a truly European market could be built."
   Regis Rousselle, head of the Paris exchange, has suggested
creating a single European list of 300 major stocks that
could be traded on any exchange.
   The Federation of European Community Stock Exchanges,
meanwhile, is planning "le Pipe," a system to provide
European stock prices and company information. A single
network will transmit data prepared by the 12 Common Market
exchanges, and it might develop into a trading system.
   The major investment firms increasingly are engaging in
informal pan-European trading through their own computerized
video-screens, away from the exchanges. But this leaves
investors less protected because there's less surveillance to
detect cheating and irregularities.
   Europe's exchanges have talked for decades about
cooperating, and it was hoped that action would replace words
with the approach of 1992, when the European Community
theoretically becomes a barrier-free marketplace of 320
million consumers.
   But Stewart Gilchrist, a director of Scottish Amicable
Investment Managers, a Glasgow-based institutional investor,
said, "I don't think we are particularly optimistic."
   Frank Lewis, executive director of European trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton International Inc. in London, said a
pan-European market was an impractical ideal. "Every local
market is always going to fight to maintain their local
autonomy and their individuality," he said.
   "There's also a hesitancy on the part of the customers."
For instance, someone investing in Portugal is likely to
believe that a Portuguese broker is the best-qualified to
offer advice, Mr. Lewis said. "That is the perception and is
to a large degree true and can be overcome, but it's an
uphill battle."
   London's exchange has used a screen-based system called
SEAQ International for five years, enabling it to win
business from other European exchanges and develop
substantial trade in international shares.
   It also benefits from being English-speaking and
better-established than its continental counterparts.
   Mr. Hugh Smith estimated that about one-fifth of West
German stock trading takes place in London, where trade in
non-British shares grew to $50.5 billion in February from $41
billion in September.
   London accounted for 35% of Europe's total market
capitalization of $1.8 trillion at the end of 1988, figures
provided by London's exchange show. Germany came in second,
with 13%, and France, third, with 11.5%.
   The market capitalization figure represents the total
value of all domestic shares listed on the major exchanges.
   West Germany is fighting back by modernizing. Last year it
launched a screen-based reporting system called IBIS, which
provides prices of blue-chip stocks to the country's eight
exchanges.
