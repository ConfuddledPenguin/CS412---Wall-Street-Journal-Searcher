   NEW YORK -- First Boston Corp. named Walid Chammah, a
managing director and head of asset-backed finance, to the
newly created post of head of fixed-income capital markets.
   Mr. Chammah, 36 years old, will coordinate First Boston's
investment banking division with its sales and trading
business, the firm said. He will report to Charles Murphy,
head of the investment banking group, and Ronald Stuart, a
senior manager in the fixed-income area.

   The move reflects the increasing importance First Boston
places on the fixed-income business, officials of the firm
said. This business recently has been in the doldrums.
   Reporting to Mr. Chammah in his new post will be Richard
Dubusc, head of syndicate; Peter Milhaupt, head of the market
officers group; and Dennis Melchior, head of new-issue
marketing. Mr. Chammah also will remain head of First
Boston's asset-backed finance group.
   First Boston is a unit of CS First Boston Inc., which is
44.5%-owned by the parent of Credit Suisse.
