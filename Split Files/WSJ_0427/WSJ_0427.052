   FRANKFURT -- IBM Deutschland G.m.b.H., the West German
unit of International Business Machines Corp., said that the
computer market in what is today East Germany will soar to
about 35 billion marks in the year 2000 and will be about
half as large a market as West Germany currently is.
   Alfred Esslinger, a member of the managing board, said at
a news conference in Stuttgart this week that the computer
market in East Germany will be 10 times as large as it was in
1988, when computer sales totaled 3.1 billion East German
marks.

   Esslinger said that IBM plans to work with several East
German companies on establishing a servicing and marketing
network. He restated earlier assertions that the company
won't invest in production facilities in East Germany. It
has, however, signed a cooperation agreement with an East
German training center for the development of software.
