   Envirosafe Services Inc., King of Prussia, Pa., said an
adjudication panel in Ohio recommended the state renew the
company's hazardous-waste permit.
   The panel, appointed by the Ohio Hazardous Waste Facility
Board, also recommended to the board that volumes of wastes
accepted for disposal be reduced to a somewhat greater extent
than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorized. For
example, the EPA said Envirosafe's new disposal cell near
Toledo, Ohio, could have a capacity of 3.8 million cubic
yards; but the state panel recommended only 2.2 million cubic
yards, Envirosafe said. The panel's recommendation also would
limit annual waste received by the Toledo site to 300,000
tons, though the limit could be raised later to 350,000 tons.

   Envirosafe said that it doesn't believe the capacity
restrictions are justified and that it will urge the board to
adopt the higher capacities recommended by the federal
agency.
