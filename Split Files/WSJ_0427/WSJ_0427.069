   LONDON -- U.K. bank shares may have lost their gloss after
serving as pacesetters for the British equities market over
the past year. But their recent downturn is considered by
analysts here as mostly guilt by association rather than
fundamental investor disenchantment.
   News of weak quarterly earnings and potential credit
downgradings at U.S. banks, along with similar trouble in
Japan's banking sector, has focused attention on the
vulnerability of the British banking sector, analysts and
fund managers say.

   "If you're frightened about U.S. banks you're not going to
get into banks in general," says Julian Robins, banking
analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., the investment
banking and securities arm of Britain's largest commercial
bank, Barclays Bank PLC.
   "Everyone is trying to draw parallels between the U.S. and
British banks right now," says Christopher Ellerton, banking
analyst for S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd.
   But the comparisons, he adds, are "not completely fair."
   Many of the larger U.S. institutions have unveiled sharply
weaker earnings for the first quarter as a result of lower
borrowings for corporate takeovers, mounting bad loans and
cuts in interest payments by Brazil and other Third World
debtors.
   And in Japan, where banks are being hurt by weakness in
the Tokyo real estate sector, news hit the markets earlier in
the week that Moody's Investors Service Inc. was reviewing
the credit of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank, which are
among Japan's largest banking institutions.
   All of Britain's five largest commercial banks reported
lower earnings in 1989 as a result of further loan-loss
provisions, the bulk related to credits to developing
countries. Of the top five, Lloyds Bank PLC and Midland Bank
PLC reported losses for the year.
   While the 1989 results largely fell within expectations,
analysts and bankers suggested 1990 would see further reduced
profitability in the core U.K. market as a result of high
interest rates and reduced consumer spending.
   Analysts added that the banks would be increasingly
exposed to defaults within the real estate and commercial
loan markets as a result of weak conditions overall in the
British economy.
   Even with that, bankers and analysts maintain that the
situation isn't necessarily as serious as in the U.S. and
Japanese banking sectors.
   They point to more solid U.K. foundations, namely the
absence of widespread bankruptcies now plaguing the U.S.
savings and loan industry.
   Also, British banks on the whole have diversified their
loan portfolios to hedge against a chain reaction of
defaults. And they are tending to hold a greater proportion
of traditionally secure home mortgages relative to their
American counterparts.
   "If you look at the real estate on the books of U.S. banks
vs. real estate on the books of banks here, the English banks
aren't bad off at all," says Barclays de Zoett Wedd's Mr.
Robins.
   Analysts add that internally British banks have positioned
themselves for leaner times, moving aggressively in the past
year to cut operating costs as a hedge against uncertain
times.
