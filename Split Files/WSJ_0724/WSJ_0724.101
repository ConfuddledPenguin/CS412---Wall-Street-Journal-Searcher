   I submit the following footnote to Peter Keresztes's
review of "Letters to Freya, 1939-1945" (Leisure &amp; Art, June
25), the correspondence of the German resistance leader Count
Helmuth James von Moltke to his wife, Freya.
   Readers of the review will be interested in George F.
Kennan's tribute to Moltke found on pages 119-122 of his
"Memoirs: 1925-1950" (Little, Brown, 1967).

   Mr. Kennan writes: "I consider him, in fact, to have been
the greatest person, morally, and the largest and most
enlightened in his concepts, that I met on either side of the
battle lines in the Second World War."
   He concludes: "I record all this because the image of this
lonely, struggling man, one of the few genuine
Protestant-Christian martyrs of our time, has remained for me
over the intervening years a pillar of moral conscience and
an unfailing source of political and intellectual
inspiration."

   My compliments for running a review of "Letters to Freya"
by the remarkable Count von Moltke. He was a great hero. Not
to nitpick, but as an old OSS man I was much involved and the
Stauffenberg assassination attempt was July 20, 1944, not
July 1. The term "Zwanzigster Juli" has entered the German
language as a euphemism for courage and sacrifice.
