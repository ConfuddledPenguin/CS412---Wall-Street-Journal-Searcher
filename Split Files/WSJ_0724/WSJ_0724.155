   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Varian Associates Inc., citing a
one-time charge, reported a net loss of $34.1 million, or
$1.76 a share, for its third quarter, ended June 29.
   The high-technology concern had profit of $9.1 million, or
45 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter
rose 13% to $343.6 million from $304 million.

   The one-time expense was a previously announced
restructuring charge of $47.1 million after taxes.
   Excluding operations that are to be discontinued, Varian
had a net loss of $18.9 million, or 98 cents a share,
compared with a net gain of $9 million, or 44 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   Without the one-time charge, Varian said it would have had
profit on continuing operations of $13 million, or 67 cents a
share, reversing a four-quarter earnings slide. Softening
demand for semiconductor equipment and a shrinking military
market fueled the decline. A spokesman said the company ended
its tailspin through improved factory efficiency and rising
orders for medical equipment, environmental monitoring
instruments and pollution controls.
   In May, the company announced that by September it planned
to sell five operations and 10 product lines, many of them
military-related, and eliminate 600 jobs. While the company
has laid off about 600 people -- including about 140 from
corporate headquarters -- Varian has yet to complete the sale
of any of its targeted businesses, which make radio frequency
systems, broadcast equipment and night-vision goggles. A
spokesman said Varian is, however, negotiating with several
potential buyers.
   For the nine months, Varian posted a loss of $18.7
million, or 96 cents a share, compared with earnings of $30.5
million, or $1.46 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue fell 4.5% to $926.1 million from $886.2 million.
