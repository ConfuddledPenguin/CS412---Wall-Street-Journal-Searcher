   NEW YORK -- LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it received
sufficient financing to complete its $1.9 billion purchase of
a 46% stake in Metro One, a cellular-phone system here, from
Metromedia Co. McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., a
Kirkland, Wash., cellular-phone operator, holds 52% of LIN.
   LIN, which operates cellular systems and has broadcasting
and publishing interests, raised a total $2.1 billion from
two groups of banks.

   Terms of the purchase call for Metromedia to receive $1.05
billion cash and $850 million of preferred stock in a LIN
unit. The transaction, which LIN expects to close in August,
would give LIN 93% of Metro One; other investors hold 7%.
   A spokesman said LIN would use the remaining financing for
general purposes.
   Metromedia, New York, has telecommunications and other
interests.
