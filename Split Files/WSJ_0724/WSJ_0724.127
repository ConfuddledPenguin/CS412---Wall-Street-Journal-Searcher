   Cyclops Industries Inc., a Pittsburgh-based producer of
stainless and carbon steel products, said it will report
losses for the second quarter and the first half.
   It cited a pretax charge of as much as $16 million for
restructuring its specialty steel division and realigning
certain carbon strip operations.

   The company said it will close a Pittsburgh plant that
produces high-temperature steel sheets, idling 85 hourly and
10 salaried employees. It said high-temperature sheet has
been a low-volume product for some time.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Cyclops earned $12.1 million,
or $1.69 a share, on sales of $301.5 million. In the 1989
first half, the company had net income of $21.3 million, or
$2.98 a share, on sales of $608.3 million. Net for the 1990
first quarter fell to $3.6 million, or 49 cents a share, from
$10.1 million, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier, on sales
that slipped to $299.3 million from $364.7 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Cyclops shares closed at $24, unchanged.
