   International Business Machines Corp. appointed the head
of its huge semiconductor operations to a staff job helping
run its U.S. business, which has been getting unwieldy.
   Patrick A. Toole, a 52-year-old senior vice president, was
named to the new position of general manager, operations, for
IBM U.S. He will report to Terry R. Lautenbach, 51-year-old
general manager of the U.S. operations, which includes the
semiconductor operations.

   Mr. Toole should be a good complement for Mr. Lautenbach,
as Mr. Toole has a strong background in development and
manufacturing while Mr. Lautenbach came up the marketing side
of IBM. Mr. Lautenbach frequently needs to referee among the
general managers who report to him, deciding, say, whether
some scarce chips should be given to the mainframe business
or the minicomputer business. The organizational structure of
IBM U.S. has been getting more complex because more
operations are being broken out into separate lines of
business. Mr. Lautenbach also needs to keep the pressure on
to cut costs; while sales in the past year have finally
started picking up in the U.S., growth is still far slower
than it is overseas.
   Moving to a staff job from a job with major operational
responsibilities is not usually a good sign. So it's possible
Mr. Toole has taken some of the heat for some recent problems
with IBM products, apparently including some difficulties
with chips that will go into the generation of mainframes
that IBM is expected to announce in September. But former IBM
employees said it's not clear whether those problems belong
to his operations or to the group that designs and builds
mainframes. The former workers add that the quiet Mr. Toole
has a good reputation internally.
   IBM named Paul R. Low to succeed Mr. Toole running the
semiconductor operations. Succeeding Mr. Low in charge of
data-storage products is Ray S. AbuZayyad, a former IBMer who
has been at Siemens AG. For both men, the appointments are a
return to familiar territory.
   Mr. Low, a 57-year-old vice president, had had most of the
semiconductor operations reporting to him before he took over
data-storage products in 1987. Likewise, Mr. AbuZayyad, 52,
had had most of his current responsibilities from 1985 to
1987, before Mr. Low succeeded him. In 1987, Mr. AbuZayyad
became the president of IBM's Rolm telecommunications
division, then he left IBM altogether to run Rolm Systems for
Siemens AG when the German company bought most of the Rolm
assets from IBM last year. Returning to IBM as a vice
president, Mr. AbuZayyad gets an expanded version of his
former job; while he used to control just the data-storage
products for IBM's mainframes, he now runs the data-storage
operations for all IBM's products.
