   And on Your Toes

   Always put your best foot forward --
   You'll find this advice is sound;
   And you can't put either of them in your mouth
   If you keep both feet on the ground.

   Views From the Fridge
                                                                                                       

   Failure to communicate with the kids
   Is a problem for families galore,
   Which we've long been solving at our house
   With notes on the refrigerator door.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.
