   SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. said it is restructuring
its non-coal minerals business, Chevron Resources Co., and
taking a $30 million charge against second-quarter earnings
for anticipated losses on the sales of assets.
   The charge will be included in the oil company's earnings
report, scheduled for today. Chevron said it expects the
asset sales could total more than $70 million. In the
year-earlier second quarter, Chevron had net income of $404
million, or $1.18 a share, on revenue of $8.2 billion.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chevron shares closed at $76.875, down 62.5 cents.
   Assets to be sold in the restructuring include several
gold properties, and American Gilsonite Co., a Salt Lake
City-based producer of solid hydrocarbon. Chevron said it is
still reviewing long-range plans for its uranium operations
in New Mexico and South Texas.
   The restructuring will result in the elimination or
transfer of 210 jobs, of which 150 are held by exploration
and other field employees. About 10 employees will be
transferred to a new strategic-minerals business unit that
will manage the three major minerals projects that Chevron
intends to retain.
   Projects to be retained are the Stillwater platinum and
palladium operations in Nye and Columbus, Mont., where
Chevron is the managing partner and owns a 50% stake in
Stillwater Mining Co.; the Collahuasi copper and silver
property in Chile; and the Lisheen zinc and lead property in
Ireland.
   Minerals operations to be retained will report to
Chevron's Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. unit based in
Englewood, Colo. Chevron Resources will manage the
disposition of its remaining assets.
