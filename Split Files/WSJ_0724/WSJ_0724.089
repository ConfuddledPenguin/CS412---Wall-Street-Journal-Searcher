   Lindley H. Clark Jr.'s June 13 Speaking of Business column
suggests that unions have created their own demise. While
some of Mr. Clark's commentary may have validity, it is
mostly flawed reasoning. The most irritating proposition is
that nonunion workers are asking the question "what good is a
high union wage if you don't have a job?" Let's rephrase the
question: "What good is a job if I can't afford food,
clothing, housing and medical care?"
   Mr. Clark suggests, "As union density has decreased,
public attitudes have changed, making it easier for
management to stand up to unions"; a groundless, incorrect
and deceptive hypothesis.

   The only attitude that has changed is that of the
government, which formerly demanded a level playing field for
both management and labor. The National Labor Relations Act
guaranteed that workers could organize and join the unions of
their choice. But the fact is, nonunion workers are scared
that if they exercise their government-protected rights, they
will be fired from the job that, even as Mr. Clark's
assertion suggests, they so desperately need. This is
economic slavery, not labor-management relations.
   All union people, along with candid management people,
know employers try to intimidate employees. While much of
this intimidation is an outright violation of the law,
employers reason that it is cheaper to pay the paltry fines
than it is to pay equitable wages, health insurance and
pensions.
   Unfortunately, our labor laws are becoming profound
hypocrisy. The U.S. government supports the right of East
European workers to organize and strike and yet its support
of workers' rights at home is disappearing. As a result, Mr.
Clark is correct: Unions are getting weaker.
   In order for labor and management to coexist accordantly,
in a relationship that by its very nature is diverse and
discordant, there must be a balance of the strength each side
can exert. When one side begins to dominate the other, the
end result must be economic collapse or anarchy, and neither
is acceptable. Free and effective labor unions cannot exist
without a democratic society and a democratic society cannot
be a democratic society without free and effective unions.
