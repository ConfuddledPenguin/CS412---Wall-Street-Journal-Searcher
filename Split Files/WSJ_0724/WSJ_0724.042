   WASHINGTON -- Savings-and-loan bailout costs shoved the
federal budget into a deficit in June, a month when corporate
tax payments usually produce a surplus.
   The government ran an $11.22 billion deficit during the
month, compared with a $7.79 billion surplus in June 1989,
the Treasury said.

   Weak corporate tax receipts were also to blame. They
failed to reach year-earlier levels, declining to $18.57
billion from $20.88 billion. Overall tax receipts edged up to
$110.61 billion from $108.25 billion. At the same time,
outlays surged to $121.84 billion from $100.46 billion.
   The slowing economy as well as the cost of taking over
failed S&amp;Ls and paying off insured depositors have wreaked
havoc with the federal budget this year. Just last week, the
Bush administration widened its estimate for the fiscal 1990
budget gap to $218.5 billion, including the thrift bailout
costs. Nine months into the fiscal year, the deficit stands
at $163.09 billion, the Treasury said.
   "I was expecting about a $2 billion surplus, which would
have been bad enough," said Stanley Collender, director of
federal budget policy at the accounting firm Price
Waterhouse. "This is close to extraordinary. I don't know how
much longer you can get bad numbers without someone sitting
up and taking notice."
   The Bush administration and congressional leaders have
stepped up the pace in their talks to reach an agreement to
slash the ballooning budget deficit in fiscal 1991, but there
were few signs of progress yesterday.
   In June, the government spent $15.82 billion to resolve
failed S&amp;Ls, the busiest month to date for the bailout.
Without that expense, the government would have posted a $4.6
billion surplus -- a modest number considering that June is a
deadline for quarterly corporate income tax payments.
   The government expects eventually to get back some of the
money it spent taking over failed thrifts by selling off
loans, securities, real estate and other assets inherited
from the institutions. For that reason, some members of
Congress argue that bailout costs shouldn't be included in
the deficit tabulations.
   But even without counting the thrift costs, the deficit
would probably be larger than last year's $151.86 billion
gap, partly because the slowing economy has crimped corporate
profits, leading to lower-than-expected corporate tax
receipts.
   More than $42 billion of federal spending last month went
to pay interest on the federal debt.
