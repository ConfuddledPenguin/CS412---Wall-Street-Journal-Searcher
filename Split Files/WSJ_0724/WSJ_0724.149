   TUNIS, Tunisia -- With the U.S. delaying military-aid
discussions and the European Community criticizing its
human-rights record, Israel has cause to complain about its
allies. Its enemies, on the other hand, never let it down.
   Last week's switch by Iraq's Saddam Hussein from
threatening Israel to intimidating neighboring Kuwait has
shifted the spotlight from Israel to the Arab world's
internal problems.

   Iraq, deep in the red from its war with Iran, wants
$25-a-barrel oil to pay its debt and fund its military
buildup. Kuwait, widely diversified with investments in the
West that benefit from lower oil prices, is happy with the
much-lower world price, recently about $14 a barrel.
   This disagreement has reopened an older wound, Iraq's
claim to sovereignty over Kuwait that predates the desert
emirate's independence from Britain in 1961. Then, Iraq was
bought off only after Kuwait paid $84 million, and even so,
territorial disputes flared in 1973 and 1976. This time,
Kuwait is likely to end up paying much more to appease Iraq
-- at least the estimated $10 billion Kuwait lent to Iraq in
the war with Iran.
   Meanwhile, the dispute has tied up the diplomatic energies
of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Tunis-based Arab
League, much to the despair of many Palestinians. The quarrel
is "a stab in the back" says the Palestinian newspaper
AsShaab.
   But to many Arabs, the Iraqi president's attack on the
sumptuously wealthy Persian Gulf leaders plays almost as well
as his earlier verbal attacks on Israel. Impoverished
Egyptians and Jordanians, in particular, resent gulf wealth
that they often see first hand as low paid laborers working
far from home. Some Arab papers have particularly praised Mr.
Hussein's call to use funds from higher oil prices to fund an
inter-Arab development agency, although the Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development already hands out hundreds of
millions of dollars a year in soft credits on top of generous
intergovernmental grants to Arab states.
   But even if Kuwait buckles, as is likely, Mr. Hussein's
attack is likely to fuel the arguments of those in Israel and
Washington who say the Iraqi leader is beyond the pale of
diplomatic discourse and unworthy of such favored treatment
as export-import bank credits.
   Meanwhile, other inter-Arab rifts -- the bitter feuds
between Syria's President Hafez Assad and both the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat and Iraq's Mr.
Hussein -- also are likely to help Israel's new hard-line
government. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, trying to avoid
talks in Cairo with Palestinians designed by the U.S. to help
further Mr. Shamir's own plan for Palestinian elections, has
abruptly switched gears and called for talks with Syria
instead.
   Mr. Shamir launched the elections proposal 15 months ago,
then backed away from any steps that seemed likely to make it
feasible. The new focus on Syria seems designed to
marginalize the Palestinians, distract Washington and create
further delays.
   The wily Mr. Assad has dropped just enough crumbs about
his desire for peace to give Mr. Shamir's aides something to
keep chewing on. The reason isn't likely to be that Mr. Assad
is about to transform into a Sadat-style peace maker. More
probably, he enjoys inconveniencing Mr. Arafat, whom he never
has managed to bring under his control.
   Both Messrs. Shamir and Assad welcome anything that delays
an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue: Mr. Shamir, because he
believes it is in Israel's best interest, Mr. Assad because
he sees delay as feeding the forces of radicalism and
militance that he supports within the Palestinian movement.
