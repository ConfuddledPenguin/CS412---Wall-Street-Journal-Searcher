   DALLAS -- Oryx Energy Co. said it made another discovery
in its horizontal drilling program in the Pearsall field in
South Texas.
   The well, the Lloyd W. Booth No. 1, tested at a daily rate
of 1,697 barrels of oil and 744,000 cubic feet of natural gas
through a 20/64-inch opening. Oryx said the well has a
horizontal displacement of 4,204 feet and produces through
intervals between 6,165 feet and 10,126 feet, which was the
total depth. The well is about five miles north of Big Wells,
Texas.
