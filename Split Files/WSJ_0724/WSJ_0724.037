   WE'RE STILL STUDYING new IRS pension regulations,
companies say.
   The proposed rules aimed at assuring that retirement plans
don't discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees
run 388 pages and "there are some areas we're not sure what
the IRS meant," says United Technologies Corp. So the company
doesn't yet know whether it will have to rewrite its
retirement plans to comply with the regulations, which are
scheduled to take full effect next year. Campbell Soup Co.,
too, says "it is a little premature."

   General Motors Corp. figures it will have to make "minor
changes but certainly nothing major." But Potomac Electric
Power Co. still has its "benefits accounting people and
actuaries" assessing how the utility will be affected. If
midlevel executives at Hershey Foods Corp. are worried their
pensions may be pinched, they haven't voiced complaints yet.
"I don't think they really understand what is going on," an
official says.
   United Parcel Service is too tied up with labor
negotiations to judge what the rules "mean to us."
                                                                                                       

   CANADA, TOO, rewrites pension regulations, curbing some
retirement savings.
   Canada's federal government doesn't require any
nondiscrimination tests like those imposed in the U.S. That
seems to be "a U.S. peculiarity," says Robert Heitzman of
consultant Kwasha Lipton. But, like the U.S., Canada does
limit the amount of tax-deferred retirement benefits that a
worker may accrue, and these are being curtailed by Canada's
new tax legislation that takes effect next year.
   The new rules say that no more than 18% of earnings, to a
maximum of 15,500 Canadian dollars a year, may be set aside
in an employee's retirement arrangements, including the
Canadian equivalent of individual retirement accounts and
corporate pension plans. Previously there had been only
separate limits. The new rules also restrict worker savings
at companies that compute pensions on the basis of career
earnings rather than final pay, Mr. Heitzman says.
                                                                                                       

   BLAME UNION ACTIVISM for job losses, an economist says.
   Unionization by itself doesn't lie at the root of
declining manufacturing employment, says Michael Zimmer, a
professor of economics at the University of Evansville in
Indiana. Instead, he says, look at the propensity of unions
to strike. Workers are more likely to strike in
"union-intense industries," especially in the durable-goods
field. And as strikes increase, workers are more apt to lose
their jobs, Mr. Zimmer says.
   The impact, moreover, lingers. "Industries that strike for
longer durations tend to be characterized by diminished
future job prospects," he says. And workers forced out in a
retrenchment following a strike often must settle for less
pay when they finally do find employment. Competition from
foreign manufacturers intensifies the job loss, pushing
workers to look for work in other fields, the economist
contends.
   "I think he's ignoring much bigger economic factors," a
spokesman for the AFL-CIO responds.
                                                                                                       

   PATERNALISM IS GONE. Half the major manufacturers surveyed
by the Conference Board say they now have only a
"business-financial" relationship with employees. Fully 70%
say workers should move on if that will further their
careers.
                                                                                                       

   MIXED FEELINGS. Three of four chief executives think
federally mandated health care would make their jobs easier
but only one in six favor it, the Employers Council on
Flexible Compensation says. They worry short-term savings
will give way to higher costs over the long term.
                                                                                                       

   MEA CULPA. Nearly 17% of 1,900 applicants at two local
public-safety agencies admit they committed recent crimes
serious enough to disqualify them from employment, says Reid
Psychological Systems, which publishes personnel tests.
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN WORKERS are worse than their foreign
counterparts, CEOs believe by a slight margin, Continental
Bank says. But the executives vote almost 4 to 1 that
American management is better.
                                                                                                       

   HIGH SCHOOL COACHES are tough to recruit in districts
offering puny pay.
   "We find ourselves with coaches with no experience
whatsoever," bemoans Lloyd Williams, athletic director of
Memphis city schools. State law, he explains, requires that
all coaches be certified teachers. But coaching stipends run
to only $1,200 a year for a head football coach, so few are
willing to take on the after-class chore. West Mifflin, Pa.,
School Superintendent John Kresovich complains "we have fewer
and fewer applicants from our staff each year."
   But generous pay and winning teams attract applicants to
some Texas and Louisiana schools. Aldine Independent School
District in Houston, for instance, pays $4,340 above the
state's $17,000 scale for a starting teacher and its coaching
supplements reach $7,000 for a head football coach. In
Dallas, the only problem is matching coach applicants with
open teaching posts.
   Albuquerque's 11 high schools turn to 200 uncertified
outsiders to coach its athletic teams.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Take heart, job seekers] Odds of finding new
employment are slightly higher in the summer months than at
other times in the year, says outplacement consultant Lee
Hecht Harrison. . . . Take heart, greedy managers] A pension
administrator promotes "an executive tax sheltered program,
free of IRS regulations and entirely discriminatory."
