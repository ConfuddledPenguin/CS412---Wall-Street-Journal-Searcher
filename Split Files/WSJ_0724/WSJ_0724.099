   Stone Container Corp., Chicago, said its board amended its
shareholder rights plan to reduce certain triggering
thresholds to protect the company's stockholders in the event
of an unwanted takeover.
   The pulp and paper concern said that as a result of the
change, the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more
of its common stock will entitle the holders of rights to
purchase a specified amount of the company's common at half
price. Under the company's existing plan, adopted in July
1988, the threshold was triggered at 20%.

   Also, the company removed an exception to this feature
that would have prevented its operation in the event that a
person or group crossing a 30% threshold became the owner of
85% or more of the common through a cash tender offer.
   Stone Container said the amendments weren't taken in
response to any effort to acquire the company.
