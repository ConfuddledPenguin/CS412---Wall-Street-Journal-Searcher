   LONDON -- The British government said it may shelve plans
to float PowerGen, Britain's second largest
electricity-generating concern, and instead sell it to Hanson
PLC or another company.
   Hanson, a conglomerate with interests in consumer goods,
building products, foods and a variety of manufacturing
industries, confirmed yesterday that it has indicated to the
government "a firm interest" in bidding for PowerGen, a
state-owned concern scheduled to be privatized in February.

   The sale is part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
electric-utility privatization plan that is expected to raise
#11 billion ($20 billion). Analysts say PowerGen alone could
fetch #1 billion.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham told the House of Commons
that if Hanson decides to bid for PowerGen, he will invite
other companies to make offers. Analysts suggested that
companies from continental Europe and perhaps the U.S. would
join any eventual auction.
   But Mr. Wakeham stressed that the government hasn't ruled
out floating the generating concern. "I therefore propose to
pursue discussions with Hanson in parallel with pushing
forward preparations for the flotation of PowerGen," he said.
   Yesterday's announcement, which sparked angry debate in
Parliament, marked the second major shift in the government's
strategy for privatizing the electricity industry. In
November, the government withdrew all of Britain's nuclear
power plants from the planned sale after the plants were
publicly criticized as unreliable and uneconomic.
   Recently, critics of the plan have suggested there isn't
sufficient investor interest to successfully float both
PowerGen and National Power, Britain's largest generating
concern. Mr. Wakeham called Hanson's overture "a vote of
confidence" in PowerGen and its management.
   Hanson's deputy chairman, Martin Taylor, called PowerGen
"a strong, good basic industry supplying continuing needs."
He declined to say how much Hanson would be willing to pay.
