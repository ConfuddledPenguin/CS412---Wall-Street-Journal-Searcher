   TOKYO -- Japan's largest producer of electronic automotive
parts, Nippondenso Co., confirmed that it is discussing a
joint-production venture with Fiat Group to build air
conditioners in Europe.
   A company spokesman said the two companies are studying a
project to operate a factory together but haven't reached any
agreement to do so. He denied a local newspaper report that
Nippondenso and Fiat are near a decision to establish a
venture.
