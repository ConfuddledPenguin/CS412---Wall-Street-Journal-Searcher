   WASHINGTON -- Politicians have stumbled onto a new funding
source for the multibillion-dollar thrift bailout: their own
campaign contributions.
   In a ritual reminiscent of the potlatch, an ancient Native
American ceremony in which tribal leaders would demonstrate
their virtue by giving away their most valuable belongings,
an increasing number of politicians, with great fanfare, are
returning political contributions from the savings and loan
industry.

   Among those who have vowed to return some or all of their
S&amp;L contributions are Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), Chairman
Ronald Brown of the Democratic National Committee and Sen.
Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), who is under scrutiny by the
Senate Ethics Committee for his ties to the failed Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   The politicians appear to disagree about what to do with
the spurned donations. In a Sunday appearance on NBC's "Meet
the Press," Sen. Dole said he thought it made the most sense
to give the money to the Treasury. That's the tack Sen.
Riegle plans to take as soon as he's finished
"cross-checking" his files for S&amp;L money, a spokeswoman said.
But the DNC prefers to return a $5,000 S&amp;L donation to the
giver, whom it declines to identify.
   Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) chose a more novel approach:
giving the money to his home state's department of revenue.
   In a prepared statement, Sen. Wirth said he would rid
himself of $98,950 in campaign contributions from the savings
and loan industry and from S&amp;L customers "known to have
failed to repay S&amp;L loans." The figure represents an
accumulation of contributions going back to 1980, when
banking deregulation began. At the time, Sen. Wirth was a
member of the House.
   Sen. Wirth said he was giving the money to his home state
because Colorado taxpayers are voters, because Coloradans may
have been personally liable as U.S. taxpayers for
contributions made by owners of failed S&amp;Ls, and because "the
cost of the S&amp;L scandal will be carried by every Colorado
taxpayer." Asked to elaborate, Sen. Wirth said that if the
money went to the U.S. Treasury it would be spent to "build
MX missiles."
   The issue of savings and loan contributions has been
prominent in a few House races around the country. In
Georgia, for example, a potential Republican opponent to
Democratic Rep. Doug Barnard put up billboards urging Rep.
Barnard to give back $20,000 in campaign contributions from
Charles Keating and his associates. Mr. Keating controlled
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, whose failure is expected to cost the
government $2 billion. A spokesman in Rep. Barnard's office
said the congressman has returned some S&amp;L contributions but
not the Keating money.
   Thrift contributions began to loom larger as an issue
earlier this month when Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, said on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that "any member who took money from the
savings and loans ought to throw it into the Treasury and
make a contribution towards this massive problem." Mr. Brown,
another guest on the program, responded with the pledge that
the DNC, "if we have received any money, is giving it all
back." According to DNC spokesman Michael McCurry, Mr. Brown
had already arranged to return the $5,000.
   A few days after Mr. Rollins's televised remarks, a
spokesman for Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), who faces
re-election this fall, told the Detroit News that Sen. Levin
would send to the U.S. Treasury campaign contributions from
any individuals who are "under investigation for civil or
criminal wrongdoing" involving thrifts. Sen Riegle made his
pledge the following day.
   Sen. Levin's spokesman, Willie Blacklow, said that Sen.
Levin had recently sent some S&amp;L money to the Treasury,
though he wouldn't say how much.
   There are signs that the Republicans are beginning to
regret making thrift contributions an issue. One week after
Mr. Rollins's appearance on "Meet the Press," Sen. Dole faced
rigorous questioning on the same program about his
presidential campaign's political contributions from Mr.
Keating. Sen. Dole said he'd be happy to return the Keating
money, but protested, "We had thousands of contributors; I
didn't go down and check them out."
