   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Greyhound Dial Corp. posted a net loss
of $60.8 million, or $1.54 a share, for the second quarter
resulting from a one-time $100 million charge to set up a
loss reserve for the bankruptcy of Greyhound Bus Lines.
   In the year-ago second quarter, Greyhound Dial had net
income of $35.6 million, or 92 cents a share.

   Greyhound Dial sold the bus company in 1987, but retained
a 22.5% stake in the bus company's parent, GLI Holding Co.
Greyhound Dial also holds Greyhound Bus Lines preferred
stock, a junior subordinated note and other notes and
accounts receivable with the bus company. Greyhound Dial also
leases substantial assets to the bus lines.
   Greyhound Bus Lines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection June 4 as the result of a strike and other
difficulties. Under Chapter 11, the court protects a company
from its creditors while it works out a plan to pay off its
debt. Greyhound Dial said its actual loss from its bus lines
investment will be determined by bankruptcy proceedings and
the results of the bus line's continuing business operations.
   Greyhound Dial reported income from continuing operations
of $39.2 million, or 97 cents a share, for the second
quarter, a 9.8% increase over year-ago income from continuing
operations of $35.6 million, or 92 cents a share. The $100
million charge for the bus lines bankruptcy was listed as a
loss from discontinued operations and was equal to $2.51 a
share. Second-quarter revenue declined 1.4% to $912.3 million
from year-earlier second quarterly revenues of $925.5
million.
   For the six months, Greyhound Dial posted a net loss of
$43.9 million, or $1.12 a share, compared with a year-ago
profit of $50.5 million, or $1.30 a share. That included the
$100 million bankruptcy charge for the bus line. In the most
recent first half, the company had income from continuing
operations of $56 million up 11% from year ago income from
continuing operations of $50.5 million.
   First half revenue rose slightly to $1.78 billion from
$1.77 billion.
