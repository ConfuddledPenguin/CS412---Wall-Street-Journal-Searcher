   A proposal by Alfred A. Checchi, chairman of Northwest
Airlines parent NWA Inc., suggesting a "controlled
liquidation" of Eastern Airlines, was presented to financial
advisers for Eastern's creditors, but no action was taken.
   Under the proposal, Northwest, St. Paul, Minn., would take
over certain Eastern planes, airport gates and maintenance
facilities, and arrange the sale of the rest of Eastern's
assets to benefit its creditors, people familiar with the
proposal said. If such an arrangement materializes, Northwest
could strengthen its position on the East Coast with little
risk, while offering Eastern's creditors a resolution of the
carrier's 16-month-old proceedings under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.

   Advisers to Eastern's creditors are expected to report on
the plan soon to the full creditors committee. That panel's
endorsement would probably speed the bankruptcy court
approval needed for such a proposal to take effect. Committee
representatives couldn't be reached for comment.
   Eastern reiterated it hasn't received any offer from
Northwest to acquire any part of the airline. It said that
Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the court-appointed trustee running
the airline, a unit of Houston-based Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., has said there is no intention to liquidate
Eastern, and that the carrier is interested only in offers
for the complete operation and its employees.
