   Mikhail Gorbachev ostensibly wants to dismantle his
centrally-planned economy. But after five years, the Soviet
Union is still mired in slothfulness and inefficiency. Why?
Because Mr. Gorbachev has not kept up the pace of his
domestic reforms.
   When Mr. Gorbachev took office in the spring of 1985, he
is said to have commissioned a study of the Stolypin reforms.
Piotr Stolypin was prime minister of Russia in the early 20th
century. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, Stolypin managed to stave off
national disintegration while reviving a moribund economy.

   In the summer of 1905, the humiliating loss of the war
with Japan precipitated a wave of strikes, mutinies and
pogroms. Czar Nicholas II granted a constitution that
established a democratically-elected parliament in October,
but that step failed to restore order. The following year,
the new parliament called for the resignation of the czarist
government and the expropriation of private property.
   Enter Stolypin. An experienced civil servant, he took over
the government with energy and decisiveness. He quickly
suppressed the revolution, and rewrote the electoral laws to
favor property owners. Stolypin believed that only
broadly-based property ownership could provide the foundation
for democracy and prosperity.
   At the time, agriculture accounted for half the nation's
GNP and an impoverished peasantry constituted 84% of the
population. The peasants lived in approximately 100,000
villages across Russia, most without electricity and some
inaccessible even by road. Their customs had changed little
since the Middle Ages. Land was owned communally by the whole
village and periodically redistributed in an egalitarian
fashion by village elders. Capable individuals had no
incentive to improve their farming practices, since the
rewards would effectively revert back to the commune. The
result was soil exhaustion and technological backwardness.
The peasant commune was a primitive socialist society.
   Stolypin blamed the peasant commune for many of the ills
affecting Russia. Since individual peasants rarely owned any
land of their own, they had no reason to respect anybody
else's property. Whenever the squalor of village life became
unbearable, they attacked the property of landowners,
shopkeepers or whoever else who happened to have more than
they did. These revolts had to be suppressed by force,
propelling Russia into a cycle of revolt and repression.
   Stolypin's solution was privatization. He wagered that the
peasants would leap at the chance to own their farms
independent of the village commune. He enacted a land reform
that gave peasants the right to claim the land they worked as
private property. They could even trade their scattered
strips for American-style homesteads.
   Peasants' distrust of the government ran deep and their
attachment to the village commune was reinforced by centuries
of tradition. But it wasn't long before the benefits of
Stolypin's reform became clear. The individual peasant farmer
could finally try out the innovative techniques he had
dreamed of; finally he could plant alfalfa without having the
village cattle come and eat it all; finally he could skip the
endless bargaining sessions at the village assembly and
concentrate on his own business.
   Within a few years, the creaking provincial bureaucracy
could not survey the lands and draw up the deeds fast enough.
By 1914, over 40% of peasant households held their land as
private property and many more waited for their petitions to
be processed. To the dismay of socialist intellectuals, the
peasants firmly rejected the notion of communal land tenure.
The big gentry estates meanwhile were squeezed out of the
market by more resilient peasant competitors; by 1916, the
gentry farmed only 11% of Russia's farmland.
   As a result, the efficiency of Russia's farming sector
improved dramatically. Russian agricultural production in the
period 1911-1913 was an average of 47% higher than in the
period 1901-1905. Domestic food consumption rose, but
agricultural exports rose even faster, by 61% between the two
periods. Russia solidified its position as the world's
largest exporter of agricultural products. Higher peasant
incomes meant higher consumption of domestic manufactures and
greater accumulation of capital (peasant savings increased
ninefold in nine years). Increased export earnings and the
solidity of the gold-backed ruble encouraged foreign
businessmen who rushed to invest in Russia's booming economy.
   Sadly, Stolypin did not live to see his reforms succeed.
In 1911, while attending a performance at the Kiev Opera
House, he was fatally wounded by a leftist gunman. With its
restructuring only partially complete, Russia was thrown into
the First World War. Strikes and mutinies precipitated a new
revolution in February 1917. Stolypin's newly-empowered
peasants refrained from joining it. But they couldn't hold
back the country's slide into anarchy and terror.
   The lesson of Stolypin's reform is that given economic
freedom, even backward peasants can become entrepreneurial
and politically conservative. Simply put, privatization pays.
But economic reform should be undertaken boldly: Vacillation
only leads to economic deterioration and political
polarization. If he is serious about economic reform, Mr.
Gorbachev needs a prime minister like Stolypin.
