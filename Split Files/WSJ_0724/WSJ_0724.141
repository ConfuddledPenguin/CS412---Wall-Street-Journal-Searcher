   Hawker Siddeley Group PLC, a British electrical and
mechanical engineering concern, said discussions to buy two
subsidiaries of UNC Inc., Annapolis, Md., were terminated
after failure to agree on a price.
   A Hawker Siddeley spokeswoman declined to say what price
range was discussed. She said that if successful, the move
would have been a "major acquisition" for the group.

   The two subsidiaries, Airwork Corp. and Pacific Airmotive
Corp., are airplane engine overhaul and repair concerns.
   The spokeswoman said the company wants to increase its
presence in this industry. The purchase would have offered
Hawker Siddeley a foothold in the U.S. industry. It acquired
Standard Aero Ltd., a Canadian concern, last August for #53
million ($96.3 million).
