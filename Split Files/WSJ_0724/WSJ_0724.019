   TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union is in a
stronger position than its U.S. counterpart as it begins
contract bargaining today with the Canadian subsidiaries of
the Big Three auto makers.
   Labor costs in Canada are lower than in U.S. plants,
resulting in savings to the companies of an estimated $7 an
hour per employee. And, although vehicle sales have slowed on
both sides of the border, some of the Big Three's more
successful models are built in Canada in newer, more
efficient assembly plants. As a result, proportionately fewer
workers have been laid off in Canada than in the U.S.

   With these advantages, the CAW confidently has set higher
wages as its top bargaining objective for the 65,000 workers
it represents at the Big Three. By contrast, the United Auto
Workers union in the U.S., on the defensive after recent job
losses, has targeted total job security in its round of
contract talks, which began last week. The Canadian union,
which broke away from the UAW in 1985, also says
"philosophical" differences account for the divergent
bargaining goals. Both unions' current contracts with General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and their
Canadian units expire Sept. 14.
   Canadian auto workers are "in relatively better shape"
than those in the U.S. and so are "playing to their
strengths," says William Pochiluk, president of Autofacts
Inc., a research firm based in Paoli, Pa.
   Mr. Pochiluk says the Big Three are drawn to invest in
Canada because of the favorable exchange rate -- the Canadian
dollar currently trades at about 86 or 87 U.S. cents -- and
Canada's system of national medical care, which cuts down on
corporate health care costs. Industry officials have said
they will make controlling health care costs one of their top
objectives in U.S. contract bargaining.
   Sam Gindin, director of research at the CAW, calculates
that total labor costs in the U.S., including wages and
benefits, amount to about $32 an hour per employee at the Big
Three. In Canada, this figure is 29 Canadian dollars (US$25)
an hour, he says. Executives at GM, Ford and Chrysler didn't
disagree with these figures.
   The CAW kicks off bargaining with a largely ceremonial
meeting with GM today, followed by meetings with Ford and
Chrysler later in the week. Each side is expected to exchange
opening statements and then adjourn for bargaining on local
issues. Formal negotiations on the national contracts will
resume in mid-August.
   Late in August, the union will pick one of the Canadian
units of the Big Three as its target and will negotiate a
pact to serve as the pattern for the other two companies.
Ford and GM are considered the most likely choices as
targets: Ford would be financially best able to afford higher
wages, but a pact with the much larger GM could be expected
to set a trend in the industry. In the U.S., analysts expect
the UAW target to be GM.
   By pushing for higher wages, the CAW could erode the
competitive advantage the Canadian industry now has, warns
Anil Verma, a professor of industrial relations at the
University of Toronto. He says Canada's attraction to
investors already has been diminished by recent gains in the
value of the Canadian dollar and by Mexico's moves to draw
investment by liberalizing its markets.
   "I think the (Canadian) union's assumption that job
security is somehow taken care of is on shaky ground," Mr.
Verma says.
   CAW officials say they won't ignore job security in their
bargaining. CAW President Robert White said in a recent
interview, "I don't think we should fool our members that
somehow we live on an island and we can guarantee absolute
job security."
   As in the U.S., Canada's auto makers are expected to make
competitiveness a major issue in the talks. Walter McCall, a
spokesman for Chrysler's Canadian unit, says Asian car makers
that have set up socalled transplant factories in Canada have
a "significant cost advantage" over the Big Three, largely
because of lower pension costs, the result of younger work
forces.
