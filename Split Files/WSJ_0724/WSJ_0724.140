   STOCKS PLUNGED in a broad sell-off that left the Dow
industrials down 56.44 points at 2904.70. The industrials
were off more than 105 points at one stage, triggering
"circuit breakers" that helped stanch the selling pressure.
Earnings disappointments sparked the slide, as investors
dumped growth stocks.
