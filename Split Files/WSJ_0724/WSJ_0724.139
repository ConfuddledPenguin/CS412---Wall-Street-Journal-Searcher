   Renault Vehicules Industriels S.A. said it reached an
agreement with some lenders of Mack Trucks Inc. to extend
debt maturity and waive certain violations of debt covenants,
satisfying one condition of the French concern's $6-a-share
tender offer for the 55% of Mack it doesn't own.
   But Renault, a unit of state-owned Regie Nationale des
Usines Renault, said Mack is continuing to negotiate a debt
extension and waivers with another group of its lenders, led
by Chemical Bank. The Chemical Bank syndicate agreed to
extend the maturity date of Mack's debt to tomorrow, but
Renault is seeking an extension until Dec. 31.

   Chemical Bank declined to comment on the talks. Mack
referred all questions to Renault.
   Separately, Renault said the Department of Justice has
asked it for additional information regarding Renault's
proposal to form a joint venture between Mack, based in
Allentown, Pa., and the truck division of Volvo AB, based in
Sweden.
