   ATLANTA -- Equifax Inc. and Telecredit Inc. said they
signed a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition
of Telecredit by Equifax in a stock swap valued at about $580
million.
   Equifax, which provides credit reports and similar
information to retailers, banks and insurers, said the
acquisition will be completed by this fall. The company said
the transaction will be handled as a tax-free merger and each
share of Telecredit will be converted into the right to
receive 2.69 shares of Equifax common stock, subject to
certain adjustments.
