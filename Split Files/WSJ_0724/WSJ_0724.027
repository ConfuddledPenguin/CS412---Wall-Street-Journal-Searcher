   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co., a photography,
chemical, drug and office equipment concern, said it plans to
introduce late next year a smaller, lower-cost model of its
chemical analyzer for the health care industry.
   Kodak now produces an analyzer, capable of performing 750
tests an hour, that sells for about $180,000, and a unit that
can perform 500 tests an hour and is priced at $110,000. The
coming smaller model, capable of 250 tests hourly, hasn't
been priced, but it will be less expensive than the larger
machines, Kodak said.
