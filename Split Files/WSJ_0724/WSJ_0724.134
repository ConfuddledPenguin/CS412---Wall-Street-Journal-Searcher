   GenCorp Inc. said it agreed to sell its last broadcasting
station, radio station KFRC-AM in San Francisco.
   The Fairlawn, Ohio, company said it agreed with competing
applicants for the broadcasting license on terms for a sale
of the station to Daytona Group of California. Daytona, of
Ormond Beach, Calif., agreed to pay about $8 million for the
station.

   Proceeds would be split between GenCorp and the competing
applicants, but the terms of the division won't be disclosed
until the transaction is approved by the Federal
Communications Commission, GenCorp said.
   RKO General Inc., a GenCorp unit, at one time was a major
television and radio broadcasting concern. However, its right
to operate the stations was challenged by various groups
because of alleged improper political payments by the parent
company and an alleged lack of candor in discussing those
payments in FCC proceedings.
   The company has been selling its stations and sharing the
proceeds with other concerns that applied for licenses to
operate the RKO stations.
