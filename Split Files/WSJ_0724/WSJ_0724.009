   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. shuffled
responsibilities for three executive vice presidents in
preparation for the eventual retirement of its chairman and
chief executive officer, Lodwrick M. Cook.
   "Our primary goal in shifting responsibilities of a number
of our senior managers is to provide broader experiences in
order to appropriately prepare for the company's management
succession needs," said Mr. Cook, 62 years old. Mr. Cook had
previously said he would remain in the top posts of the oil
company until he reached 65.

   Ronald J. Arnault, 47, formerly chief financial officer,
was named executive vice president in charge of the company's
exploration and production overseas and in the 48 contiguous
states domestically. He also will oversee Arco Coal Co.
   James S. Morrison, 60, was named chief financial officer
succeeding Mr. Arnault. Mr. Morrison formerly was executive
vice president in charge of Arco's West Coast petroleum
operations, which include Arco Alaska Inc., Arco
Transportation Co. and Arco Products Co.
   James A. Middleton, 54, who formerly oversaw exploration
and production in the 48 contiguous states, will assume Mr.
Morrison's former duties overseeing West Coast petroleum
operations.
   Messrs. Arnault and Middleton will report to Robert E.
Wycoff, 60, Arco's president and chief operating officer. Mr.
Morrison will report to Mr. Cook.
   Analysts said the shift in responsibilities is a
particular boost for Mr. Arnault, who was a principal
architect behind the company's huge restructuring program
started in 1985. "It tells me that Arco is going to move
aggressively in the international area," said Bernard J.
Picchi, an oil analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York. "I
think this is a way that (chairman) Lod Cook is saying, `We
believe in international, and we want a man who was
successful in restructuring the company to oversee that
effort.'"
