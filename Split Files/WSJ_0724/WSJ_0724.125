   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. plans to name
Leonard Reinhart president and Donald Robinson executive vice
president of a new consulting group, which will recommend
investment managers to the brokerage firm's clients.
   Mr. Reinhart, 35 years old, and Mr. Robinson, 32, have
been senior vice president and first vice president,
respectively, at Shearson's consulting-services division. The
business that the two executives will lead has been part of
consulting services; it will get a higher profile as an
independent entity, Mr. Reinhart said.

   The group "evaluates money managers {who are} independent
of Shearson and recommends them to our clients," Mr. Reinhart
said. "We determine the risk you're willing to take and what
your goals are, and we match you up with an investment
manager."
