   WASHINGTON -- James Hansen, the NASA scientist who helped
make the "greenhouse effect" an international issue, is
proposing a $200 million satellite program to settle the
question of whether the Earth is warming and why.
   The climate satellite proposal, which has circulated among
scientists, already has provoked considerable controversy. It
calls into question the necessity and timing of a gargantuan
National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite
program, called the Earth Observing System, or EOS, which
could cost as much as $50 billion over 25 years.

   Mr. Hansen's proposal comes out of a series of private
meetings that Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), chairman of the
space and science subcommittee, has held with about 20
environmental scientists. Sen. Gore says he plans to release
a number of proposals in October to accelerate climate
research. "Something like what (Mr. Hansen) is proposing does
make sense," the senator said.
   Essentially, Mr. Hansen suggests taking three instruments
off EOS and NASA's proposed space station and putting them on
a relatively small satellite, which would study clouds, water
vapor and particles suspended in the atmosphere. If NASA
launches two climate satellites, for about $200 million,
starting in 1995, Mr. Hansen predicts, the satellites would
yield enough information to settle the central debate over
global warming by the end of the decade.
   "It would answer the questions of whether the Earth is
warming and whether humans are the cause of that," Mr. Hansen
said. An article giving details of his proposal is scheduled
to be published in the fall issue of Issues in Science and
Technology, a publication of the National Academy of
Sciences.
   The climate satellites would focus on the role of clouds,
Mr. Hansen said. Generally, clouds cool the Earth by
reflecting sunlight back into space -- something akin to a
giant window blind. But scientists don't know whether cloud
coverage is increasing or what kinds of clouds predominate,
leading to big differences in the severity of global change
predicted by different computer models. "Climate satellites
are a must," said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a University of
Chicago climate specialist.
   Mr. Hansen's proposal puts him in the spotlight for the
third year in a row. In 1988, he set off alarms about global
change by testifying in Congress, during a blistering heat
wave, that he was "99%" certain that a global warming trend
had begun. Last year, he became a cause celebre when the
White House Office of Management and Budget tried to censor
his testimony. This year, the quiet, determined director of
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York is
taking on NASA's vast EOS project.
   NASA envisions launching a half-dozen $3 billion
satellites, which would carry as many as 16 different
instruments to study the Earth, including some as big as
cars. The first satellite, EOS-A, is scheduled for launch in
1998 and five others will follow over 15 years. The National
Space Council, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, is concerned
about the cost and risk of the project and is considering
whether to restructure it.
   Mr. Hansen says the EOS satellites, already three years
behind schedule, are bound to fall further behind -- leaving
climate scientists with big gaps in needed data. He says NASA
could fund the climate satellites out of a portion of the EOS
project devoted to smaller satellites.
   But EOS officials think that Mr. Hansen is underestimating
the cost of his climate satellites and that his project would
siphon funds from EOS, undercutting support for the program.
"The dumbest thing to do is to say maybe EOS ought to slip a
year to solve Jim Hansen's problems," said Gerald Soffen,
EOS's project scientist.
   Two NASA scientists at the agency's Langley Research
Center sent Mr. Hansen a six-page letter criticizing his
proposal as too limited because it fails to consider other
environmental problems EOS will address, such as ozone
depletion, acid rain and deforestation. Berrien Moore, a
University of New Hampshire scientist involved with EOS, said
he doubts that the climate satellites will settle the
global-warming issue. "I don't think you'll get a smoking
gun," he said.
   For his part, Mr. Hansen says he doesn't want to kill EOS,
which will provide data needed to make better predictions of
how the climate will change in different places on Earth. But
he is willing to forgo EOS data for a time to answer what he
considers a more pressing question sooner.
   The criticism of Mr. Hansen's proposal is overlaid with a
sense of consternation about Mr. Hansen's ability to dominate
the global-warming debate and fear of his popularity in
Congress. If the climate satellite approach proves popular,
Mr. Moore said, "There's a high probability that Congress
will say we'll throw up a $200 million satellite and buy out
of the (EOS) project."
