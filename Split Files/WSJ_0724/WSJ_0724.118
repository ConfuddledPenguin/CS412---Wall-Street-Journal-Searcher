   If consummated, the transaction would result in a
substantial gain to EG&amp;G, the company said, adding that "we
would like to have closing by year-end, but any number of
things could happen."
   EG&amp;G's fluid components group of Warwick, R.I.,
contributed about $180 million in revenue in 1989, the
company said, while EG&amp;G had total sales of $1.65 billion.
