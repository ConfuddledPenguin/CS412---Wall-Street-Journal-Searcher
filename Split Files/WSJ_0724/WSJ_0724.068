   The venture is due to begin production in the second half
of 1992 at an output of 50,000 tons a year, the official
said.
   Idemitsu expects to sell a large part of the production to
Japanese household appliance makers operating in Europe,
according to the official. Polystyrene is the basic material
of the shells of most appliances.
