   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. posted a 57% decline in
second-quarter net income, reflecting a slide in aluminum
prices.
   Meanwhile, Asarco Inc.'s earnings were nearly flat, as
increases in lead, zinc and gold prices were offset by a
decline in copper prices.

   Amax, an aluminum, gold and energy company, reported net
fell to $56.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $130.9
million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Operating profit
declined 44%, to $102 million from $181 million.
   Sales fell 8.9% to $984.7 million from $1.08 billion.
Aluminum accounted for nearly two-thirds of Amax's total
sales. Amax said industry ingot prices declined about 26% but
added that the prices appear to have bottomed out.
   Allen Born, Amax chairman and chief executive, said the
company was "encouraged" by its performance so far in light
of the continuing sluggish economy. The quarter's results
included several one-time items, whose net effect was an
after-tax gain of $6.1 million, a spokesman said.
   The second-quarter results were slightly lower than
analysts had predicted. Vahid Fathi, an analyst with
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in Cleveland, said in a phone
interview that 1989 was a record year for Amax earnings.
   For the six months, earnings fell 56%, to $106.9 million,
or $1.22 a share, from $245.1 million, or $2.87 a share, a
year ago. Sales fell 7.3%, to $1.91 billion from $2.06
billion.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Amax shares fell 62.5 cents to $25.50.
   Asarco, a nonferrous metals company that also has
interests in specialty chemicals, reported second-quarter net
of $50.2 million, or $1.21 a share, nearly flat with $50.8
million, or $1.20 a share a year ago.
   Sales rose slightly, to $543.1 million from $539.3
million.
   Richard de J. Osborne, chairman, president and chief
executive, said the results "reflect continued good market
fundamentals" for the primary metals Asarco produces.
   Mr. Fathi said he doesn't believe the "strength in copper
is sustainable on a fundamental basis." The analyst said the
recent rise in copper prices, to $1.30 a pound, was a result
of disruptions in supplies by strikes and political unrest in
several copper-producing countries.
   For the six months, Asarco posted a 28% decline in net, to
$86 million, or $2.07 a share, from $119.3 million, or $2.83
a share, a year ago. Sales fell about 8% to $1.06 billion
from $1.16 billion.
   Asarco also said union members at its Ray unit in Arizona
overwhelmingly ratified a wage agreement. About 650 workers
struck the mine July 1 after the previous contract expired;
workers began returning to work last weekend.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Asarco shares also fell 62.5 cents to $27.50.
