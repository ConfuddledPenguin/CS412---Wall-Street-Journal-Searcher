   NEW YORK -- A plunge on the New York Stock Exchange pulled
the dollar to its lowest level against the mark in 2 1/2
years. The U.S. currency ended nearly 1% lower against its
German counterpart, posting its worst close since the
beginning of 1988.
   The dollar also fell substantially against the Swiss franc
and other continental European currencies and to a lesser
degree against the pound.

   Meanwhile, profit-taking on long, or overbought, Canadian
dollar positions -- led by trade in futures -- actually
boosted the U.S. currency's price in Canadian dollars.
   The dollar almost held its own against the yen, retreating
only slightly. The Japanese currency was facing pressures
similar to those on the dollar after a second consecutive
sell-off of Tokyo stocks.
   As yen holders sold the Japanese currency for dollars and
then changed those dollars into marks, the U.S. currency was
supported against the yen while its descent against the mark
was exaggerated.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6220 marks, well below 1.6365 marks late Friday in New
York.
   The U.S. currency held above 148 yen and was trading at
148.20 yen, down from 148.60 yen in New York late Friday. The
mark rose to 91.30 yen from 90.80 yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 148.20 yen, down from 148.50 yen there late Monday. The
dollar was trading at 1.6230 marks.
   The dollar also fell to 1.3815 Swiss francs Monday, 5.4445
French francs and 1188.3 Italian lire from 1.4010 Swiss
francs, 5.4945 French francs and 1199.8 lire late Friday.
   Sterling was trading at $1.8225, up from $1.8190 late
Friday.
   The last time the U.S. currency bought so few marks was
Jan. 4, 1988, when the dollar ended at 1.5858 marks.
   "We are getting to levels that are very significant," said
Bernd Becker, chief New York dealer for Oesterreichische
Laenderbank. "We've been dealing for so long in this narrow
range. This is the biggest move I've seen in a long time. No
one wanted to miss the boat, so everyone jumped on."
   After emerging from a listless Asian day and European
morning, the dollar felt steady selling pressure in New York
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost ground right from
the opening bell.
   But only when the industrial average was down 102 points
during the session did currency trading rooms awaken from
their midsummer slumber to sell the dollar out of its
accustomed range.
   As the dollar crossed a divide at 1.63 marks, stop-loss
selling sped its descent, said Andy Robertson, Chase
Manhattan's corporate foreign exchange sales manager. In 10
minutes, the dollar fell an entire pfennig against the mark.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.10 an ounce, up $7.80. This was the
highest close since May 22. Estimated volume was a very heavy
six million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$368.45 an ounce.
