   "This is a four-year plan," Ed Rollins, National
Republican Congressional Committee co-chairman, said last
year about his one-year-old attempt to cut into the
Democratic majority in the House. "I tell {candidates}, `It
may take two times, but if you go with us in 1990, we'll be
with you in 1992.'" Over at the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, the same message is being heard. Douglas
Sosnik, political director, says: "For the past year there
have been a significant number of members with safe seats who
are already preparing for potentially tough races in 1992."
   This linkage of two election cycles by campaign
strategists is quite rare, and the result of three factors:
changes in campaign finance law, the reapportionment and
redistricting that will follow the 1990 census and the makeup
of the Senate class that comes up for re-election in 1992.
These factors should combine over the next two election
cycles to produce a record number of retirements, as well as
substantial turnover in both the House and Senate.

   During the five elections of the 1980s, an average of
about 31 House members chose not to seek re-election. That's
down significantly from the previous decade, when an average
of about 41 members retired or sought other office. But in
1992 alone, at least six dozen congressmen are likely to
decide against seeking re-election. Combine the 27
representatives who are not seeking re-election in 1990 with
the at least six dozen likely to bow out in 1992, and you
have about a quarter of the current membership back home
after 1992. (The turnover could be even greater if for any
reason -- abortion, S&amp;Ls -- there is a national electoral
tide against one of the parties, as in 1982, or against
incumbents in general.)
   Reapportionment has already had a significant impact on
this year's House races, as incumbents focus their
re-election energies on parts of their districts they think
will gain importance after boundaries are redrawn and
campaign strategists recruit candidates for this race with an
eye toward the new districts of 1992. More than a few
congressmen will find themselves without districts in 1992,
since as many as a dozen states could lose at least one seat
because of population shifts and a handful of larger states
in the Northeast and Midwest will lose at least two seats.
These congressmen will have to retire, run against other
incumbents or seek election to a different office.
   But while redistricting will bring political challenges to
incumbents, 1992 is likely to be best remembered as the year
when dozens of veteran House members took the money and ran.
   House members who took office after Jan. 8, 1980, may not
convert campaign funds to private use. But congressmen who
were sworn in by that date were "grandfathered" by earlier
legislation and can take campaign funds with them when they
leave the House. Due to changes adopted by Congress last
year, however, any officeholder seeking re-election in 1992
will automatically lose the right to convert those funds.
   With 79 grandfathered members having more than $200,000 in
their campaign accounts at the end of March (to say nothing
of the 89 grandfathered members who will run for re-election
this year and have less than $200,000 on hand), it wouldn't
be surprising to see dozens of veteran lawmakers opt for
retirement. Add the 21 members who will reach at least 70
years of age in 1992 but don't yet have at least $200,000 on
hand, and you have another reason for a record House
turnover.
   Naturally, not all members who are eligible to convert
campaign funds will choose to do so. Some simply don't need
the extra cash, and others are in such powerful positions or
have such long careers ahead that they can resist the
temptation. But the change in campaign law will prove to be a
strong incentive for retirement, especially to members for
whom retirement is a consideration anyway.
   With more Republican than Democratic senators up for
re-election this year (18 vs. 16, before the death of
Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii), GOP strategists
began this cycle just hoping to maintain their 45 seats in
the Senate. But a strong class of candidates this year has
given the Republicans at least an outside chance of ending
Democratic control of the Senate. Even a GOP gain of a seat
or two in November would place the party in excellent shape
for 1992, when 20 Democratic senators and only 14 Republicans
are up for election. For the GOP, then, 1990 is a stepping
stone to 1992, a presidential election year when the party
has a realistic chance of regaining control of the Senate.
   The Senate class of 1992 offers plenty of opportunities
for ambitious politicians and would-be politicians. At least
three incumbents -- California Democrat Alan Cranston, New
York Republican Alfonse D'Amato and Washington Democrat Brock
Adams -- have suffered from the sort of negative publicity
that usually terminates a political career.
   Sen. Cranston, who has been hurt by his relationship with
financial wheeler-dealer and campaign contributor Charles
Keating, would face a serious primary challenge if he were to
seek re-election. At least five congressmen -- Democrats
Barbara Boxer, Robert Matsui, Tom Lantos and Mel Levine and
Republican David Dreier -- have been mentioned as possible
California Senate hopefuls, and other congressmen might be
interested. Reps. Levine and Dreier, in particular, have been
squirreling away money for years, anticipating a statewide
bid. Both have about $1.5 million in the bank.
   If California Republican Sen. Pete Wilson is elected
governor this November, the state's voters will have to fill
his seat as well in 1992.
   In New York, Sen. D'Amato has been hurt politically
because of his alleged role in the HUD scandal, as well as by
suggestions that he used his influence to help large
contributors to his campaign. Among those mentioned as
opponents are former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, New York state
Attorney-General Robert Abrams, Rep. Thomas Downey and Rep.
Stephen Solarz, who had almost $1.5 million in the bank at
the end of March. And in Washington, Sen. Brock Adams has
been embarrassed by charges that he made sexual advances
toward the daughter of a longtime friend. Republican Rep. Rod
Chandler is mentioned as a likely opponent.
   Other senators up for re-election in 1992 seem likely to
draw credible challengers. Besides Sen. Cranston, two others
of the "Keating Five" -- Democrat John Glenn of Ohio and
Republican John McCain of Arizona -- are up in 1992, and
Senate races in Idaho, Oregon, Wisconsin and a number of
Southern states should produce interesting races. All these
opportunities should attract a record crop of House members
intent on moving up the political ladder or looking for a new
opportunity following redistricting. The nature of the 1992
Senate class, then, should add further to House turnover.
   Some Republican optimists look to 1992 as the year when
the GOP takes over the House. But while unusual circumstances
will combine to create an unusually large number of open
seats, over the past few years the Democrats have proved far
more adept at winning supposedly competitive races. Still,
the likelihood of six dozen House vacancies will give both
parties what they have been clamoring for: an opportunity to
test their appeal in districts without entrenched incumbents.
