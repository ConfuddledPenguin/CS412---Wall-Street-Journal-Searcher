   Backer Spielvogel Bates lost one of its most prestigious
clients yesterday, as Xerox Corp. pulled its $25 million-plus
account and handed it over to Young &amp; Rubicam.
   The switch followed a highly-guarded two-month review
pitting all four of Xerox's U.S. agencies, including Backer,
against one another. The scope of the change came as a
surprise to many in the industry, who had expected Xerox to
yank only the corporate portion of its business, not its
product advertising. Backer had handled both types of
advertising; its "We document the world" campaign ended in
November, while its newest campaign centers on Xerox's recent
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality award.

   Xerox and the agencies wouldn't publicly discuss billings,
but industry estimates range from $25 million to $40 million.
According to Leading National Advertisers, Xerox spent about
$18.2 million on U.S. advertising last year.
   The account move deals yet another blow to Backer
Spielvogel Bates, the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. unit that had
handled Xerox since 1986. Backer earlier this year suffered a
painful loss when Prudential Insurance pulled its $60 million
account. The agency also has been a poor new business
performer in the U.S.
   Carl Spielvogel, Backer Spielvogel's chairman and chief
executive officer, declined to comment on the Xerox loss. But
he defended his agency's record saying: "Our business is
strong. On a global basis we have picked up $460 million in
new business this year, and our year isn't over until
September 30." He said most of the wins came in Europe,
followed by Asia, but he added that the U.S. agency is ahead
of last year in billings due to "good growth from existing
clients. We have to gear up our new business efforts, and
that's what we're doing."
   The account loss couldn't come at a worse time for Backer.
With parent Saatchi hit by declining earnings paired with a
heavy debt load, rumors have abounded that Backer would be
put on the block.
   But in an interview yesterday, Robert Louis-Dreyfus,
Saatchi's new chief executive, dismissed the speculation as
"rubbish." He said that in the past three weeks, he has heard
he is selling Backer to at least four different buyers, but
that he has no plans to do so, nor has he ever: "I haven't
changed my mind since the beginning."
   "I echo the sentiment," Mr. Spielvogel said. "At a certain
point, if the parent company decides to sell, they said they
would talk to me and my management group first. I have no
reason to doubt that." Mr. Spielvogel has been quite vocal
about his desire to buy back his agency from troubled
Saatchi.
   For Young &amp; Rubicam, meanwhile, the Xerox account is an
important win. The privately held firm has handled Xerox in
Europe for more than 20 years, and has long wanted to get its
hands on the U.S. business.
   A Xerox spokesman said Young &amp; Rubicam's European
experience was a clear plus, because "Xerox wants more
integration between our corporate campaigns throughout the
world." He said Xerox wants ads that can be adapted for
different countries world-wide. The company's strategy, he
added, will be to position itself as "the document company,"
offering everything from copiers to fax machines to computer
networks. The new campaign is expected to break in September.
   The win was the first following a reorganization at Young
&amp; Rubicam in May, under which Joseph DeDeo, formerly
president of the agency's European operations, became
president of the entire agency. Also pitching the account
were Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Lowe Marschalk, both of which will
continue to handle direct response advertising for Xerox.

   Ayer Gets Puritan Oil
                                                                                                       

   Procter &amp; Gamble pulled its Puritan Oil ad account from
Grey Advertising and awarded it to Ayer, New York. According
to Leading National Advertisers, a tracking firm, P&amp;G spent
about $14 million advertising the brand last year.
   P&amp;G, based in Cincinnati, said it switched the brand
because it wanted to have its two trademark cooking oils
handled by separate shops. Grey, based in New York, will
continue to handle the Crisco brand.
