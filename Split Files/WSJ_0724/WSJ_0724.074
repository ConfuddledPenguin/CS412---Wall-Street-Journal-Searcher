   In an unusual ruling, a New York judge has ordered a
hearing to determine whether a verdict in a psychiatric
malpractice case should be set aside because one of the
jurors apparently was mentally incapacitated during
deliberations.
   The decision last week by State Supreme Court Justice
Michael J. Dontzin of Manhattan highlights the troubling
question of when jurors should be allowed to change their
minds after they reach a verdict.

   The question arose in a lawsuit filed by Audrey McDonald
and her mother, Bertha Jackson. The women sued New York City
Health and Hospitals Corp. and J.C. McIntosh seeking damages
for personal injuries Ms. McDonald sustained in a suicide
attempt just a few hours after Dr. McIntosh didn't admit her
to the hospital. After a two-week trial, the jury rejected
the malpractice claim and ruled in favor of the defendants.
   During post-trial interviews with the women's lawyer, one
of the six jurors said that another juror had appeared
mentally incapacitated during the deliberations. All the
other jurors, including the one in question, later submitted
affidavits in support of the women's request for a new trial,
stating that during deliberations the juror had been
disoriented, confused and unable to connect her thoughts.
   It is common practice for lawyers on the losing side of a
case to conduct such post-trial interviews. In this case,
plaintiffs' lawyer Larry S. Reich told the judge he talked to
the jurors only to assess his own performance in the trial.
But often lawyers also seek to uncover evidence of juror
misconduct or jury tampering.
   However, New York state, along with most U.S.
jurisdictions, typically refuses to allow jurors to impeach
their own verdict. The reason for this is to protect jurors
from being pressured following a trial into attacking the
credibility of their verdict or second-guessing their
decision.
   The one recognized exception to that rule has been when
the jurors claim there was some outside interference during
the deliberations, according to Prof. Stephen Gillers of New
York University School of Law.
   Despite that long-standing policy, Justice Dontzin said
that he could not ignore the serious issue raised by the
jurors and that he wanted to ensure that the plaintiffs were
not denied a fair trial.
   B. Lee Ware of the Houston firm of Vinson &amp; Elkins,
co-author of a book about juror misconduct, said that each
state employs different standards to determine whether a
juror is competent. "Just because the jurors themselves
believe the person is incapable doesn't mean it is true under
the law," Mr. Ware said.
   Lawyers for both sides said they could not comment on the
case because it is still pending. A date for the hearing
hasn't been set.

   INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE is formed by two big law
firms.
   The new law firm created through the joint venture, called
Brobeck Hale &amp; Dorr International, was launched by 400-lawyer
Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison in San Francisco and 300-lawyer
Hale &amp; Dorr in Boston. The joint venture is believed to be
the first among domestic U.S. law firms.
   The new law firm plans to open a London office in August
and a New York office this fall. Initially, two partners will
work in each branch. All four will resign their partnerships
in the two U.S. law firms. Lawyers involved say the joint
venture is recruiting additional partners and associates for
the new offices.
   Major U.S. law firms have been scrambling to take
advantage of perceived new business opportunites in Western
and Eastern Europe. Many law firms have opened branches in
London and Brussels and some have formed loose affiliations
with European law firms.
   John W. Larson, managing partner of Brobeck Phleger, says
that his firm and Hale &amp; Dorr decided to join forces in part
because they believed their offices on the East and West
Coasts and their similar practices would give them an
advantage in the international arena. Both law firms are
known for their high-tech expertise.
   John D. Hamilton Jr., managing partner of Hale &amp; Dorr,
said the two law firms would put up $3 million to $5 million
over roughly a two-year period to launch the venture. Mr.
Larson said that Brobeck Hale &amp; Dorr could become profitable
by 1993.
   Initially, the two law firms expected to have a third
joint venture partner, the Washington law firm of Hogan &amp;
Hartson. But that firm decided not to participate, largely
because of potential conflicts of interest between its own
clients and clients of the joint venture.
   Separately, Hogan &amp; Hartson announced that it would open
offices in London and Brussels this fall.

   ARIZONA ISN'T IMMUNE from suits filed by drunk drivers,
court rules.
   The Arizona Supreme Court struck down a novel state law
that barred drunk drivers and their passengers who are
involved in car wrecks from suing city and state governments
over poor road design and maintenance.
   The state law was passed by the Arizona legislature in
1984 to deter drunk driving and to help offset a previous
state Supreme Court decision on the liability of local
governments and their employees. The court had ruled in 1982
that governments are rarely immune from liability. The new
law was controversial because Arizona's constitution is
particularly protective of a plaintiff's right to seek
redress through the courts.
   The recent Supreme Court case stemmed from a 1985 crash in
which two passengers were badly injured when the car they
were in slammed into a bridge abutment in Tucson. The
passengers, one of whom is now a quadriplegic, sued the
driver and the city, claiming the road they were on was
dangerously designed and not properly maintained.
   When defense lawyers for the city moved to dismiss the
case against Tucson, the judge declared the new state law
unconstitutional. That decision was overturned by the Arizona
Court of Appeals, but reinstated by the Arizona Supreme
Court. The justices said the question of who may be held
partially responsible for causing injuries must be decided by
juries.
   "The Arizona constitution forbids either the trial judge
or the legislature from interfering with the plaintiff's
right to have a jury examine the existence or extent of
contributory negligence," the court ruled.

   MOSCOW-BOUND: Clifford Chance, a 1,000-lawyer British
firm, announced it will open an office in Moscow later this
year. A Clifford Chance partner and an associate will work at
the new office, which will be jointly operated with the
Soviet Institute of State and Law, a group of Soviet lawyers
and legal scholars.
