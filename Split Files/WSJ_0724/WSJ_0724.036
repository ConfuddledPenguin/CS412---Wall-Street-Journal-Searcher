   GERMAN WOMEN: LEFT OUT?

   Women feel left out as the two Germanys move toward
unification, the West German Women's Council said.
   "Half the population is being shut out of the unification
process," the council said after a meeting of about 80
women's groups representing more than 10 million women in
West Germany. The council criticized the West German
government over the treaty being negotiated with East Germany
for the social union of the two countries.
   "In the second state treaty (on social issues) there is no
perceptible concept of women or children's issues," Council
Chairwoman Brunhilde Fabricius said.
   One of the major social issues dividing the two Germanys
as they prepare for unification by the end of the year is
abortion. The Bonn Justice Ministry said last week that East
Germany's more liberal abortion laws wouldn't be adopted by a
united Germany.
                                                                                                       

   FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   Foreign investment in China fell sharply in the first half
of this year but an easing of foreign sanctions, imposed
after last year's military crackdown, should mean growth in
coming months, a Chinese official said. Liu Xiangdong,
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade, said the number of new foreign-investment projects
approved during the first half of the year fell 8.1% to 2,784
and their total contracted value slumped 22% to $2.35
billion. He blamed the slump, which occurred despite a steep
rise in investment from Taiwan, partly on what he called
distorted reports by Western media on the political unrest
last year.

   EC HELPS ITS TROUBLED REGIONS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community said it had earmarked 663 million
European currency units ($835.3 million) to help
underdeveloped regions in the 12-nation trade bloc. Spain
will get the largest share, with 514 million ECUs for
scientific-research programs in Andalusia, Asturias and
Castilla-La-Mancha. Among other beneficiaries, two
industrially declining regions in England and three in
Scotland will share 60.6 million ECUs.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE CAR PROGRAM
                                                                                                       

   The Philippine Trade and Industry Department said that
only car makers that sell their basic models at 175,000 pesos
(about $7,700) per unit can participate in the nation's
so-called people's car program. The program was launched
early this year by the department to make more cars
affordable to consumers. The department made the price
announcement after speculation arose that participants in the
program would be allowed to raise their retail prices to
200,000 pesos per unit because of the steady depreciation of
the peso and higher labor costs.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH TV PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   The French government said it would provide state-owned
Thomson S.A. with three billion francs ($545.2 million) over
the next five years to finance the electronics group's
research and development in the field of high-definition
television, familiarly called HDTV. In May, Thomson linked up
with NV Philips of the Netherlands in a 20-billion-franc HDTV
joint research and development program over five years and
has already devoted six billion francs to its HDTV research.
                                                                                                       

   MEXICAN PRICES
                                                                                                       

   Mexican Labor Secretary Arsenio Farell Cubillas said his
government would take further steps this year to restrict
increases in prices and wages, the daily newspaper El
Universal reported; he didn't specify what those steps would
be. His statements, in an interview, came as opposition
lawmakers lashed out at the government's wage- and
price-control program and demanded higher wages to meet
rising prices. Mr. Farell was quoted as saying that higher
wages would mean higher prices because they would raise
industrial and manufacturing costs.
                                                                                                       

   GAS MASKS FOR POLLUTED POLAND
                                                                                                       

   Poland is considering issuing gas masks in the southern
part of the country to protect people from air pollution, an
official said today.
   A proposal is being drafted to distribute the masks in
heavily industrialized Katowice province, said Col. Czeslaw
Bujala of the provincial Civil Defense Office. Air pollution
is particularly severe in Katowice, which accounts for 20% of
Poland's industrial output. A 1988 report said the province
is home to a quarter of Poland's 900 worst-polluting plants.
   The province has 1,053 factories making hazardous
materials or using them for production, the Zycie Warszawy
newspaper reported. It said initial plans call for
distributing gas masks to up to 100,000 people, particularly
those living near seven plants considered the most dangerous
in case of accidental emissions.
   Col. Bujala said the gas-mask plan still must be approved
by Civil Defense headquarters, he said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan rejected a Chinese offer of two pandas. A Taiwan
official said the rejection wasn't a political move. Taiwan
zoologists don't have the know-how to raise the animals, the
nation's Council of Agriculture said. . . . Some 70,000
immigrants have come to Israel so far this year, most from
the Soviet Union, Immigration Minister Yitzhak Peretz told a
parliamentary committee. He predicted 20,000 immigrants a
month from August onwards.
