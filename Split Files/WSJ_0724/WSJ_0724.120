   Telefonica de Espana S.A. said net income surged 28.5% in
the first half of 1990 to 42.01 billion pesetas ($417.8
million) from 32.69 billion pesetas a year earlier.
   The company said that a 7.3% rise in service charges
helped bolster profits in the first half of 1990.

   Telefonica's general director, German Ancochea, called the
company's first-half performance "reasonable" in light of a
"sluggish" first quarter, before higher service charges took
effect.
   Mr. Ancochea noted that the company is negotiating with
the government to establish a pricing framework designed to
guarantee Telefonica a stable income. The formula, pegged to
Spain's inflation rate, would enable the company to finance
its investment plans through earnings.
   The telecommunications monopoly reported a 38.6% jump in
financing costs, reflecting Bank of Spain's tight credit
restrictions.
   Financing costs stood at 68.47 billion pesetas in the
first six months of the year, compared to 49.40 billion
pesetas a year earlier.
