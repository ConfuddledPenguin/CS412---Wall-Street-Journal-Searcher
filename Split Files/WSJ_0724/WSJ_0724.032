   LIVINGSTON, N.J. -- Howard Savings Bank reported a
second-quarter net loss of $15.7 million, or $1.09 a share,
after adding $25 million to its allowance for possible loan
losses.
   Howard is one of many thrifts that have been hurt by weak
real estate markets in the Northeast. Howard's nonperforming
loans climbed 25% from March 31 to stand at $503 million as
of June 30.
