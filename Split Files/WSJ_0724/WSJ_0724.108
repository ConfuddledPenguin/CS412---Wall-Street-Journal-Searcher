   The "circuit breakers" that have gradually been added to
financial markets since 1987 got their toughest test of the
year yesterday. They passed.
   The system of trading halts in the Chicago stock-index
futures market, order slowdowns on the New York Stock
Exchange and other measures aimed at preventing a financial
meltdown began to be invoked shortly after 10:30 a.m. EDT. At
that point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen more
than 100 points in the first hour of trading and was sinking
about two points a minute. Selling pressure was concentrated
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where futures on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index are traded.

   At 10:34 a.m., the S&amp;P futures had sunk to 352.80, down 12
on the day. That decline was enough to trigger a Merc circuit
breaker that blocked any S&amp;P futures trading at lower prices
for 30 minutes.
   The Merc's restriction "certainly broke the decline," said
Ron Bechky, a stock trader at Montgomery Securities Co. About
16 minutes later, enough buy orders began arriving at the
Merc that futures trading could resume at higher prices.
Futures rallied somewhat in the next hour, while stocks also
recovered some ground.
   The Merc's circuit breaker "did exactly what it was
supposed to do," said Jay Hohmann, head of futures trading at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. "It gave the
market a moment to stabilize itself."
   Although stocks and futures spent the rest of the day deep
in minus territory, the remainder of trading was far more
orderly. By day's end, stocks and futures had recouped much
of their losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at
2904.70, down 56.44, while the S&amp;P futures finished at
357.85, down 6.95.
   The New York Stock Exchange took less decisive action
yesterday. It doesn't have any provisions for halting
trading, no matter how sharp a single day's price declines
may be. The Big Board did, however, take several small steps
toward reining in stock-index arbitrage trading for the day.
   In index arbitrage, traders shuffle money between futures
and broad baskets of stocks, depending on which is cheaper.
As the Dow Jones industrials fell 30 points, and then 75
points, the Big Board blocked index arbitragers from quick
access to its automated order delivery system.
   Shortly after noon, the Big Board also asked that index
arbitragers "voluntarily" agree to sell individual stocks
only if the most recent price change was upward. This
restriction is meant to avoid an avalanche of selling in
stocks that are already falling in price.
   Traders differed on how much impact, if any, the Big
Board's actions had. "It had no effect on us at all," said
Jeff Miller, a managing partner at Tabak Miller &amp; Hirsch, a
New York securities firm specializing in index arbitrage. But
a major index arbitrager, who asked that his named not be
used, said the Big Board's curbs "kept us from doing index
arbitrage as aggressively as we wanted."
   Last month, a New York Stock Exchange panel headed by
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith called for more
extensive circuit breakers, including a one-hour Big Board
trading halt if the Dow Jones industrials fell 100 points.
Yesterday's partial market rebound without a trading halt,
however, is likely to undercut the Smith panel's
recommendations, which already had met plenty of investor
resistance.
   "Circuit breakers can't keep markets from going up or
down," said Robert Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust
Co. "All they can do is allow all participants to be informed
about where the market is and develop their strategies
accordingly."
   According to traders at the Chicago Merc, yesterday's
market sell-off began with big futures sell orders from major
Wall Street firms such as Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co. The Merc traders speculated that the sell orders
were on behalf of European investors; the traders said the
selling helped drive down the stock and futures market in the
initial 30 minutes. Salomon and Goldman traders declined to
comment on their activities.
   At the market's midmorning bottom, Merc traders said,
about 600 to 700 S&amp;P 500 contracts were offered for sale by
speculators and other firms. Each S&amp;P contract represents 500
times the value of the S&amp;P 500 index and is worth about
$178,900, so the total amount offered corresponded to about
$107 million in stock.
   The Merc traders said that Salomon bought about 250 to 300
contracts, while Goldman purchased about 150. That buying
soaked up a lot of selling pressure, traders said, and helped
the stock and futures markets rebound.
   If the Merc traders' figures are accurate -- and if
Salomon and Goldman were trading for their own accounts
instead of for customers -- yesterday was a profitable day
for the two Wall Street giants. If Salomon held the futures
contracts it purchased at midmorning until the market close,
it would have booked at least a $750,000 profit on its
futures trades, while Goldman would have cleared $450,000.
   Another stock-index futures contract, the 20-stock Major
Market Index, which is traded on the Chicago Board of Trade
and mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average, sank low enough
yesterday morning to set off a circuit breaker. Trading in
the MMI was effectively halted for seven minutes, beginning
at 10:40 a.m. EDT, a Board of Trade spokeswoman said. At that
point, the MMI was down 20 points at 579.50.

   Corrections &amp; Amplifications
    THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE will halt trading for one
hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points.
The Big Board delays program traders' use of its automated
order system by five minutes only if stock-index futures fall
enough to trigger trading limits at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Yesterday's edition misstated the Big Board
restrictions.
