   ST. LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp., in an effort to shore
up its troubled A-12 Navy attack-plane program, said it
placed several senior executives on special assignment,
including Herbert F. Rogers, president and chief operating
officer.
   Mr. Rogers will relocate to Fort Worth, Texas, where the
plane program is located, and assume the duties of general
manager of the Fort Worth division. Mr. Rogers will continue
to report directly to Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief
executive officer.

   William A. Anders, General Dynamics' vice chairman, will
assume Mr. Rogers's corporate management duties. The new
assignments "will not change the timetable" of Mr. Anders's
scheduled appointment as chairman and chief executive officer
of the company Jan. 1, a spokesman said.
   Charles A. Anderson, corporate vice president and general
manager of the Fort Worth division, will become program
director of the A-12. John A. Lamers, vice president of the
A-12 program, will become deputy program director.
   Mr. Pace said the new assignments will help focus
necessary corporate and division resources on the A-12. The
company last week took a $450 million charge against
second-quarter earnings for the delayed program, resulting in
a net loss of $240 million. General Dynamics' partner in the
program, McDonnell Douglas Corp., didn't take any such
charge.
   In addition to improving performance on the A-12 contract,
Mr. Rogers's special assignment "will assure that the other
important aircraft and business programs of the division
receive continued management focus," Mr. Pace said.
