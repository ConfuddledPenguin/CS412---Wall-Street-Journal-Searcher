   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. has told dealers it plans to
raise prices on most 1991 models between 4% and 5%, with some
models jumping as much as 9% from year-earlier levels.
   Among the biggest proposed increases: A $1,077 boost in
the base price of the least expensive Taurus models.

   Ford's tentative 1991 prices, sent to dealers late last
week, indicate that the No. 2 auto maker wants to boost most
base sticker prices at a rate roughly equal to the general
level of inflation. Ford's pricing moves appear aimed at
bolstering its sagging U.S. automotive profit despite
stiffening competition from Japanese auto makers and General
Motors Corp.
   But some analysts and dealers said Ford will have trouble
making its pricing strategy stick.
   "If the domestic {auto makers} all go up 5%, that will
dramatically narrow the gap between comparable domestic
vehicles and comparable Japanese vehicles," said Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Joseph Phillippi. Currently, he said,
many Japanese cars still cost more than comparable domestic
models.
   Ford could change some or all of its prices between now
and the start of the 1991 model year in October. Auto makers
typically look over their competitors' preliminary prices
before setting final numbers for the fall lineup.
   So far, dealers said GM and Chrysler Corp. haven't
released their preliminary 1991 prices. But Chrysler said it
will offer new, low-priced "America" versions of its Dodge
Sundance and Plymouth Shadow compact cars, starting at $7,599
for two-door models and $7,799 for four-door models. The 1991
Sundance and Shadow "America" cars, essentially stripped
versions of current models, replace the discontinued Dodge
Omni and Plymouth Horizon models as the lowest priced
domestic cars in Chrysler's lineup.
   Some of the biggest price boosts Ford plans will affect
certain versions of its Taurus and Sable midsized cars and
its sporty Mustang model.
   Ford is proposing to increase the base price of the
cheapest Taurus L model $1,077, to $13,717 from $12,640 a
year earlier. A Ford spokesman said the 8.5% increase
reflects the replacement of the current three-speed automatic
transmission with a new electronically controlled four-speed
automatic transmission, as well as additional sound proofing.
   Meanwhile, Ford plans to boost the price of the Mustang LX
5.0 Liter coupe $1,106, or 9.1%, to $13,270. The company
spokesman said this Mustang model, which accounts for just 4%
of total Mustang sales, is getting new, larger wheels and
new, adjustable sports seats.
   Ford also plans to raise prices on most truck and van
models. The hot-selling Explorer XLT four-door off-road
vehicle, introduced last March, will start at $19,091 this
fall, up 2.6% from its $18,605 introductory price. Ford is
proposing to boost the starting price of the least expensive
version of the popular Ford F-150 full-sized pickup 7%, to
$10,971.
   In addition, Ford said it will tack on $10, on average, to
the delivery charges customers pay. The delivery charge for a
Taurus LX will rise to $480 from $470, a Ford spokesman said.
And charges for certain optional equipment will go up, too.
Automatic glare-reducing mirrors offered on several of Ford's
luxury models will cost $111 for the 1991 model year, up from
$99 in the current model year.
   Ford actually made its 1991 pricing move in two steps. In
June, the auto maker slapped midyear price boosts on many
1990 models, in a move analysts saw as a way to soften the
blow of increases this fall.
   Dealers had varying reactions to Ford's tentative 1991
prices, first reported in yesterday's editions of the trade
journal Automotive News. "I really feel they were
conservative," said Bill Schicker, owner of McMahon Ford in
St. Louis.
   But Jim Hoffer, manager of Jordan Ford in Mishawaka, Ind.,
expressed surprise at the big proposed increases on the
cheapest Taurus models. "That scares me," he said. "There's
no reason for them to be up a grand."
   Prudential-Bache analyst Philip K. Fricke said even the 4%
to 5% price boosts proposed for the bulk of Ford's lineup may
prove too much for a relatively soft market. "It's kind of
shooting for the stars," Mr. Fricke said of Ford's strategy.
   What's more, Mr. Fricke said, Japanese auto makers are
benefiting from the relative weakness in recent months of the
yen against the dollar. The result, he said is that Japanese
auto makers could "minimize price increases and still offer
more" standard features.
   Indeed, that's what the major Japanese auto makers did
last fall, when the Big Three boosted prices sharply in part
to recover the costs of additional safety equipment. The
result was a sharp drop during the fall and winter in sales
of Big Three cars, and market-share gains for Toyota Motor
Corp., Honda Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Corp.
