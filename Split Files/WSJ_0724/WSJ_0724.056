   Tim Robertson, the son of evangelical TV preacher and
onetime presidential hopeful Pat Robertson, is proving to be
adept at another kind of conversion: born-again television.
   Over the past three years, the younger Mr. Robertson, 35
years old, has transformed the Christian Broadcasting
Network's cable channel from a Bible-thumping religious
programmer with a few old western reruns into The Family
Channel, a mainstream -- if somewhat mild-mannered --
entertainment network.

   In the hotly competitive cable market, Family Channel has
substantially boosted its ratings and ad revenues and now
reaches nearly 50 million homes, or 54% of all U.S. TV
households. For this fall, it is aiming its efforts at prime
time, doubling offerings there and spending $100 million on
series and other original programs.
   For viewers looking for an alternative to the titillation
of "Twin Peaks," Family Channel may have the answer; its
small-town America looks more like "Bordertown," where a
Canadian Mountie and a U.S. Marshal patrol the border and vie
for the affections of a pretty doctor. Even though it eschews
sex, drugs and violence and refuses ads for alcohol and
R-rated movies, Family Channel is emerging as a scrappy
competitor to such established cable powerhouses as USA
Network, Turner Network Television and ESPN.
   Competitors praise Mr. Robertson for upgrading Family
Channel. "Tim has been very serious about running a network
since he took over," says Kay Koplovitz, president of USA
Network. "The Family Channel has a whole new look in prime
time, and they've made a big commitment to original
programming." But she adds, "just because it's original
doesn't mean it's going to be competitive."
   Some advertisers are impressed. "The Family Channel is
making major strides to get into the competition with their
squeaky-clean image, and they are working hard to be an
original program supplier," says Bob Perlstein, executive
vice president of media buyer SFM Media Inc. Adds Steven
Kubinsky, ad director of Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit,
"Family has segued into a mainstream cable network very
well."
   Some critics, however, say the channel is somewhat
schizophrenic. "A religious vision for the channel is still
very much in evidence, and that has kept Family struggling to
find a balance between the wholesome and the holy," says a
recent critique in television trade journal Channels. Family
Channel, it adds, "is attempting to shed just enough of its
preacher image to please the marketplace while retaining
sufficient religion to comfort its carryover flock."
   And at least one effort to straddle both worlds failed:
CBN's attempt three years ago to launch a nightly half-hour
news program with a religious bent. The show was canceled
after just two months when advertisers refused to buy time.
"No one would believe we could do an objective newscast,"
says Mr. Robertson. "We were smart enough to know you can't
push water uphill, and I hope we will always be smart enough
to know when we've done something that doesn't work."
   Originally spawned 13 years ago to bring CBN's "700 Club"
fund-raising show to millions of cable subscribers, the
network's overhaul started when the younger Mr. Robertson was
named president in 1987, after spending his entire career
working in CBN's broadcasting operations. Mr. Robertson saw a
dearth of family-oriented fare on ad-supported basic cable
and began upgrading CBN Cable's programs, rechristening it
the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and dropping CBN from the name
and the logo last year.
   In January, the conversion was completed; in order to
preserve its tax-exempt status, CBN separated Family Channel
from the ministry, selling it to International Family
Entertainment, a new partnership led by the Robertsons and
Denver cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., for $250 million
in cash and notes convertible in a few years to stock
representing 18% of the concern; TCI also agreed to assume
$43.5 million in program commitments.
   CBN had been under pressure for some time to unload the
cable channel; under Internal Revenue Service rules,
nonprofit organizations are prohibited from operating
commercial enterprises that account for more than an
"insubstantial" portion of their revenue. Combined ad sales
and fees from cable operators will bring in well over $100
million this year, compared with a negligible $2 million in
1981.
   The Robertsons say no funds raised from the TV ministry
have gone to the commercial network, which has until now
financed programming via internal cash flow and partnerships
with producers.
   CBN talked to a number of possible investors, including
Hollywood studios, but the Robertsons' insistence on keeping
"The 700 Club" and maintaining control of programming and ad
policies were always a deal-breaker. Tele-Communications, by
contrast, says many of its cable subscribers pay for cable
just to get "The 700 Club," and others like the idea of safe
but entertaining family programming.
   Tele-Communications also made a very good deal for the
Robertsons, giving them the control they sought and the
opportunity to substantially increase their own personal net
worth if Family Channel continues to prosper. Mr. Robertson
already has global ambitions; he is discussing a European
version of the channel.
   Like its rivals, Family Channel is offering a wide range
of programs in different "day parts" aimed at children,
women, and men. Animation company Dic Enterprises Inc. is
producing a block of children's programming called FunTown,
and Lucasfilm Ltd., creator of such movies as "Star Wars,"
has developed a new series based on the popular computer game
"Maniac Mansion." Along with the American Pediatrics
Association, Family Channel is producing "Healthy Kids."
   Also on the lineup is a series based on the movie "The
Black Stallion," and "T and T," which stars the former
"A-Team" actor known as Mr. T. Family Channel is also adding
new episodes of "Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop," about a supposed
descendant of the fabled TV dog, and "Zorro," a new version
of the old series. In the new "Big Brother Jake,"
body-builder-to-the-stars Jake Steinfeld is a celebrity who
gives up the high life to bring up five foster children. Not
everything is so original; there's a takeoff of the ABC
network hit "America's Funniest Home Videos" dubbed "Zaniest
Videos: You Asked For It]"
   Family Channel bought some broadcast network reruns such
as CBS Inc.'s canceled "Beauty and the Beast." But it
continues to draw respectable male audiences with
all-afternoon weekend blocks of old standbys like "Wagon
Train," "Gunsmoke," "The Big Valley," "The Virginian" and
"Bonanza: The Lost Episodes." It may also get involved in
distributing a western-oriented cable channel, "The Cowboy
Network," that is being discussed.
   Despite a tough ad climate, Family Channel's ad revenue
rose to $68 million in 1989 from $54 million in 1988; Tim
Robertson says ad revenue is expected to exceed $80 million
this year. And like rivals USA and TNT, it is increasing the
number of slots allocated to local cable systems to sell ad
time on the network.
   Although it continues to devote several hours daily to
religious programs, Family Channel doesn't sell any ads for
"The 700 Club," which was moved to 10 p.m. from 8 p.m. And
the network is deliberately vague on the programming schedule
it provides advertisers, using the listing "various" for time
slots for other religious programs.
   "Advertisers ultimately came to the realization that we
deliver a media value that they need and want," says Dick
Hammer, who heads advertising sales for the channel. While
there was plenty of resistance three years ago, he adds,
nowadays, "the ownership and the religious roots of the
organization never come up in discussion." Mr. Kubinsky of
Nestle's says that in recent presentations, "one of the
things they told us was that this is a channel that you can
stick your kid in front of and not worry about what he or she
might be exposed to."
   As for complaints that changes have left the network with
a schizophrenic image, Mr. Robertson says: "At the core of
who we are, there remains a commitment to providing
value-based programming." While shows don't "all have to be
about going to church or synagogue on weekends or running
around saying grace over food," he adds, Family Channel is
committed to "solid entertainment where good guys win, bad
guys lose, people aren't engaging in gratuitous sex, and
violence is a last resort where the bad guy is punished or an
innocent defended."
