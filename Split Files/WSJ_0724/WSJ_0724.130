   Ted Turner stole the spotlight from athletes at his
Goodwill Games in Seattle yesterday, picking a new president
for his Cable News Network and conceding that the games
themselves will result in a significantly larger loss than
initially believed.
   W. Thomas Johnson Jr., vice chairman of Times Mirror Co.,
is expected to be formally named CNN's new president this
afternoon, succeeding Burt Reinhardt. The choice is viewed as
reflecting Mr. Turner's desire to recharge the 10-year-old
network and reposition it as a primary channel, or what
people in the television industry call a "top of mind"
network.

   For all its success, CNN has hit a plateau in the past
year. While the network's viewership soars when big new
events break, it ebbs during periods of calm. Moreover, CNN,
once unique in its ability to offer news 24 hours a day, now
faces considerable competition on cable TV.
   Several months ago, Mr. Turner, chairman and chief
executive officer of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., was close to naming Paul Amos, executive vice president
for programming at CNN, as the network's new president,
according to an executive close to the company. But Mr.
Turner decided instead to shake up CNN, retaining both an
executive recruiter and Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. to study
the network's management and future direction. Mr. Turner has
said his primary concern for CNN has always been editorial
integrity. And Mr. Johnson, as a seasoned newspaper executive
with a major metropolitan daily, possesses strong
credentials.
   Mr. Johnson, a 48-year-old native of Macon, Ga., certainly
answers the call for change at CNN, having spent most of his
career in print journalism. A former White House fellow, he
first came to prominence in 1967, when he was named deputy
press secretary, and later became special assistant, to
President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served as executive vice
president and director of Texas Broadcasting Corp. in Austin
from 1970 to 1973. He started his newspaper career in 1973 as
executive editor and later became publisher of the Dallas
Times Herald, which was acquired by Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror. He was named president of the Los Angeles Times,
Times Mirror's flagship newspaper, in 1977, and became
publisher three years later.
   From Times Mirror's point of view, Mr. Johnson's departure
isn't a complete surprise. Last August, he was succeeded as
publisher and chief executive of the Los Angeles Times by
David Laventhol, Times Mirror's president. Newspaper industry
analysts said at the time that the shuffle seemed geared to
inject the Times with the benefit of Mr. Laventhol's deeper
editorial background and his experience with the recent
growth of Times Mirror's Newsday in New York. The move also
was viewed by some observers as increasing Mr. Laventhol's
chances of eventually succeeding Robert F. Erburu as Times
Mirror's chairman, a post for which Mr. Johnson had once been
viewed as a likely candidate.
   Mr. Johnson, meanwhile, became chairman of the Los Angeles
Times and chairman of Times Mirror's newspaper management
committee, a move that stripped away his day-to-day oversight
of the newspaper. Mr. Johnson said at the time that he was
assuming "broader responsibilities," which included
overseeing companywide marketing, acquisitions and newsprint
supply for Times Mirror's newspaper group.
   Mr. Reinhardt, 68 years old, president of CNN since 1982,
was said in early 1989 to have signed a three-year contract
with Turner Broadcasting, with the understanding that a
search for his successor would soon be started.
   Mr. Johnson's expected move to CNN dismayed several of the
network's executives, according to another executive close to
Turner Broadcasting. At least four CNN executives have been
mentioned as possible successors to Mr. Reinhardt. They are
Mr. Amos, the programming executive; Lou Dobbs, vice
president and managing editor of CNN Business News; Jon
Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News; and Ed
Turner (no relation to Ted Turner), executive vice president,
newsgathering.
   Asked to comment on Mr. Johnson's selection, Ed Turner,
the executive vice president, said: "Whatever Ted wants. I'll
give Tom Johnson my enthusiastic support. I don't know what
his plans are, {but} it's a relief to get a guy with that
kind of reputation and someone who comes from one of
America's great newspapers." Mr. Dobbs of CNN Business News
said, "It's much too early to judge what the impact will be."
   Most of CNN's top executives are scheduled to meet with
Ted Turner and Mr. Johnson this morning in Seattle.
   Separately, at Turner Broadcasting's annual meeting in
Seattle yesterday, Mr. Turner said he expects the 1990
Goodwill Games loss to be "considerably more" than the $13
million that the company has already charged against earnings
for the event.
   Mr. Turner said losses from the games could climb into the
$26 million range, the amount of Turner Broadcasting's
deficit on the first Goodwill Games in Moscow four years ago.
Mr. Turner's comments marked the company's highest public
projection of Goodwill Games losses to date, and cast doubt
on whether Turner Broadcasting's board will support Mr.
Turner's goal of making the games a lasting, quadrennial
event.
   "The board will decide whether to go forward," Mr. Turner
said.
   Before the games opened here Friday, Turner Broadcasting
executives had said this year's games must show progress from
1986, both financially and in terms of their image as a
world-class sporting event. A strong field of athletes has
showed up to compete, but the Olympic Games knock-off has
evidently failed to arouse the requisite enthusiasm among
advertisers and television viewers to stem Turner
Broadcasting's losses.
   In other business at the annual meeting, Turner
Broadcasting's board declared a 2-for-1 split of its Class A
and Class B shares, payable Sept. 4 to stock of record Aug.
13. As of last month, Turner Broadcasting had approximately
49.6 million Class A common shares and about 26.8 million
Class B common shares outstanding.
   In another matter, a shareholder nominated the actress
Jane Fonda, a close companion of Mr. Turner's, for election
to the company's board. The nomination never came to a vote,
but it spawned an aside from Mr. Turner. "Miss Fonda has
enough influence," he said.
