   McDonald's Corp., joining the fast-food flight from
cholesterol, plans to stop cooking its french fries and hash
browns in saturated fat.
   At one time, McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., had
resisted suggestions that it drop beef tallow shortening,
which is heavy in saturated fat, from its cooking process.
The company contended that the tallow enhanced the fries'
taste.

   But yesterday, after a similar move by rival Burger King,
McDonald's said it will convert from a blend of tallow and
vegetable shortenings to an all-vegetable oil it said is
nearly free of cholesterol. The current blend is 55%
unsaturated. The new cooking process will be 100%
unsaturated, McDonald's said.
   McDonald's has been under increasing pressure from
nutrition-minded critics to drop tallow. In its announcement
yesterday, the fast-food chain said the decision "was based
on the very positive results from more than eight years of
extensive research and customer tests."
   It said the change is expected to be completed in its U.S.
restaurants by year's end.
