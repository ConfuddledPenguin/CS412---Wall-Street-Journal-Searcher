   Union Carbide Corp. reported that second-quarter profit
fell 38%, while Monsanto Co. posted a 2.5% increase made
possible by an assets sale.
   Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., continued to be hurt by
the downward pressure on prices in its mainstay commodity
chemical business, though the company's earnings were toward
the high end of the range of analysts' estimates.

   Monsanto, based in St. Louis, would have posted a 9.6%
profit decline without the one-time gain on the sale, largely
because of a weather-related decline in sales of agricultural
chemicals. Its operating performance was in line with
analysts' expectations.
   The results of these two major chemicals companies will
probably be mirrored as others in the industry disclose
results of the latest quarter. Other commodity makers besides
Carbide, hurt partly by excess production capacity in certain
lines, are expected to post sharp profit declines. More
diversifed companies, like Monsanto, are expected to report
more modest decreases or in some cases increases.
   In the latest quarter, Carbide earned $116.0 million, or
81 cents a share, against $186 million, or $1.33 a share, a
year earlier. The results included a nonrecurring gain of $20
million, or 14 cents a share, from the sale of a business to
Hoechst Celanese Corp. That gain was partially offset by a
charge of $8.6 million, or six cents a share, related to the
expense of discontinuing certain business lines.
   In chemicals and plastics, pretax operating profit fell
39% to $172 million. Profit in industrial gases increased 59%
to $121 million. In carbon products, profit dropped 18% to
$14 million.
   Quarterly sales were $2.14 billion, down less than 1% from
$2.28 billion a year ago.
   Six-month profit was $210 million, or $1.47 a share, down
46% from the year-ago $387 million, or $2.76 a share.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Carbide shares closed at $19.625, up 62.5 cents.
   At Monsanto, quarterly earnings were $247 million, or
$1.90 a share, up from $241 million, or $1.77 a share, a year
earlier.
   The company's one-time gain in the latest quarter was $31
million, or 24 cents a share, which resulted from the
divestiture of certain assets of a joint venture in Japan
with Mitsubishi Kasei Corp.
   Pretax operating profit from crop chemicals fell 20% to
$172 million from the record quarter of a year ago. In the
other chemicals segment, whose products include plastic for
auto windshields, profit fell 12% to $127 million, owing in
large part to slower sales into the U.S. auto industry.
Profit in the G.D. Searle &amp; Co. pharmaceutical unit was $13
million, versus a $4 million loss a year ago.
   Sales edged up 1% to $2.37 billion from $2.35 billion.
   Six-month profit was $441 million, or $3.37 a share, down
4.8% from the year-earlier $463 million, or $3.39 a share.
   Monsanto shares rose $1 to close at $50.25 in composite
Big Board trading.
