   NEW YORK -- The stock market sell-off quickly spilled over
into commodities yesterday morning, but then futures traders
had second thoughts and started buying, causing prices to
rebound.
   Precious metals and crude oil futures were the exception
to this pattern, performing strongly throughout the session.

   One reason the carnage in stocks first sent most
commodities prices falling was concern that stock-market
losses might cause some investors who play both securities
and futures markets to raise cash by selling futures. This
kind of selling didn't materialize, and in the late morning
and afternoon many commodities regained their losses and in
some cases even finished higher.
   A more fundamental concern was that the sharp drop in
stocks was a signal "that a recession may be shaping up and
people aren't going to buy commodities," said James Kneafsey,
president of Cambridge Financial Management in Cambridge,
Mass. But "as the stock market stabilized and turned higher,
it became evident that the stock-market plunge wasn't a sign
of a recession to come but only a classic correction from
recent record advances."
   Gold was the most glittering commodity performer, even
overshadowing cotton, whose prices fell the daily limit
before recovering to post gains.
   August delivery gold rose $7.70 an ounce to $369.70.
"President Bush asking for higher taxes and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan talking about lower interest rates
and easier money have been revolutionary developments and a
recognition of a dire financial situation, which favors
gold," said Harry Bingham, executive vice president of Van
Eck Funds, New York.
   Mr. Bingham noted that gold has been under pressure from
Middle Eastern selling in recent months and has been seeking
a bottom. Yesterday, the dollar plunged and oil prices were
strong, two factors that helped gold.
   "We may have seen a major turnaround in gold," he said.
   There was a pickup in Middle Eastern buying of gold
bullion as well, said William O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch, New York. In addition, "Gloomy
predictions that it will be a struggle to come up with the
necessary cuts to reduce the deficit in the federal budget
have benefited gold," he said.
   September delivery silver was up 3.3 cents an ounce at
$4.9280, while October platinum advanced $6.30 an ounce to
$487.60.
   Cotton futures prices dropped their daily limits of two
cents a pound in the October, December and May contracts
before recovering to close 0.67 cent higher in the October
delivery.
   According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for
Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, substantial rains in
parched cotton-growing areas of Texas were the major price
depressant.
   "Between one-half and two inches of rain fell in the
non-irrigated high plains of Texas over the weekend," said
Mr. Simon. "There hadn't been any rain for six weeks. Some of
the crop is dead, but the moisture benefited the remainder."
   Mr. Simon said prices strengthened on buying back of
contracts by traders who earlier had sold them on the belief
prices might continue to decline. "The close was strong," Mr.
Simon said.
   Grain traders in Chicago at first were gripped by the
concern that the severe stock market decline might force
traders to liquidate their commodity positions to raise funds
to satisfy demands for more capital in their accounts. When
that didn't happen, grain prices rebounded from initial
declines to post gains.
   Analysts said grain prices weathered the storm because
speculators happen to be relatively scarce. For example, open
interest -- or the number of contracts that have to be either
nullified by opposite trades or fulfilled by delivery of the
commodity -- in soybeans has slipped back to levels seen
before the 1988 drought. With the Midwest mired in a rainy
summer, there has been little opportunity for small traders
to speculate on crop-damage weather.
   At the same time, the stock market retreat hit just as
crop prices were already feeling around for a bottom. The
prices have been damped this month by improving crop
prospects in the U.S. and the continuing concerns about the
ability of the Soviet Union to finance its imports of U.S.
agricultural commodities.
   One sign of this is that some corn futures contracts
suddenly found strength midway through the session yesterday
after falling to the $2.50-a-bushel range.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for
December delivery settled at $2.5875 a bushel, up 4.25 cents.
   According to Jerry Welch, editor of the St. Louis-based
commodity market letter Commodity Insight, commodity markets
yesterday got all three things they needed to send them
higher: a weak dollar, stronger crude oil prices and a
declining equity market.
   Mr. Welch said that corn and oats have historically led
grains. He noted that oats initially declined only one-half
cent a bushel and closed six cents higher, which he took as a
bullish sign. He also pointed to corn's recovery and higher
close.
   Yesterday's "lows in corn, oats and soybeans could be the
lows for seven or eight months," Mr. Welch said. He added
that this year could parallel 1987, when the sell-off in the
stock market in October was the beginning of a giant rally in
grains that ended in 1988.
   Energy market participants were far more focused on the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting that
will begin Thursday in Geneva than on the stock market. Very
few traders were willing to sell contracts short ahead of the
meeting, so crude oil for September delivery rose 46 cents a
barrel to $20.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Traders expect OPEC ministers to cap production for member
countries at or below 22.5 million barrels a day in the third
quarter. Traders believe that action will help to curb the
tremendous oversupply of oil in world markets that has
depressed prices.
   December copper futures were off 0.65 cent a pound at
$1.1230. December traded as low as $1.1100 as traders sold
contracts on the belief that the stock market might be
reflecting a weaker economy and slower demand for copper.
Settlement of two mine strikes, one in Peru and the other in
the U.S., also contributed to price weakness.
   World sugar dropped sharply and posted only a moderate
rebound. The October contract ended with a loss of 0.39 cent
at 11.14 after dropping to a low of 10.93 cents. An absence
of significant demand for sugar on the world market has been
a price depressant.
   Coffee for September delivery settled 0.25 cent a pound
higher at 87.15 cents, while September cocoa recovered from a
sharp drop to $1,230 per metric ton to end with a gain of $17
at $1,259, just $10 below the high of the day.
   Orange juice futures were off 1.85 cents a pound at
$1.6225.
   Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Inc.,
said that with asset allocation such a hot subject now, he
would expect the stock market sell-off to cause some major
players to move stock market money into contracts such as the
CRB Index.
   "If they are lightening up in stocks, they have to put
their money somewhere," he said.
