   LONDON -- Sir James Goldsmith believes he knows how to
make bread in the food business.
   Sir James, whose investment group owns 29.9% of Ranks
Hovis McDougall PLC, is urging the major British baker and
food producer to expand into Europe "instead of buying brands
in the U.S."

   "There are two natural opportunities for RHM: Western
Europe, where the market is fragmented, and Eastern Europe,
where the food industry is retarded, insufficient and
inefficient," Sir James said in an interview in Paris. "In
Eastern Europe, you've got the opportunity not for products
like pheasant in aspic, but good-quality healthful foods."
   The Ranks Hovis stake is Sir James's last remaining
holding of his investment vehicle, Anglo Group PLC, which
offered holders a small part of its Ranks Hovis stake in
exchange for Anglo common and bonds.
   Ranks Hovis has some of its own ideas about business. The
company agreed to sell its breakfast cereal operation to CPW
S.A., a joint venture of General Mills of the U.S. and Nestle
S.A. of Switzerland, for #93 million (US$167 million).
   In Windsor, England, Bob Rogerson, Ranks Hovis finance
director, said "we don't disagree" with Sir James's views
about Western Europe. "We have a natural affinity for Western
Europe -- but we can't be everywhere." And, he said, the
situation in Eastern Europe "is less clear -- those markets
aren't so well-developed, nor are the countries wealthy."
