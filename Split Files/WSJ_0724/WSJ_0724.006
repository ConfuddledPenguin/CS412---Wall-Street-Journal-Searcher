   DETROIT, Ore. -- Each summer for the past four years, a
group of Oregon environmentalists have camped out in the
Willamette National Forest to hear a concert and learn about
old-growth trees.
   But this year the Forest Service has refused to issue a
permit for the event. The reason: The Aug. 24-26 get-together
might disturb a nearby pair of Northern spotted owls, the
bird to which environmentalists heretofore have flocked in
their fight against timber interests.

   The Forest Service says it's concerned that the music,
along with 1,000 or more people tromping through the woods,
might frighten the adult owls from their nest, leaving their
fledglings behind. And campers scavenging for firewood could
remove ground cover for mice and other small creatures that
the owls eat. "It's a combination of things," Detroit Ranger
District biologist James Farrell says of the reasons for the
permit denial.
   But Michael Donnelly sees the devil quoting Scripture for
his own purpose. Mr. Donnelly's group, Friends of the
Breitenbush Cascades, has battled the Forest Service over
clear cutting in areas near the concert's site. Hard feelings
from that, he hints, may be behind the permit hassle. "They
wouldn't look for owls then, but now that we want to have a
concert they look for them," he says of the Forest Service.
   Others also see woodsy Machiavellianism at work. "The
general observation is that the owls are quite tolerant of
human activity," says Richard Brown, a former Forest Service
biologist who is now with the National Wildlife Federation's
Portland office. "It may be stretching things a bit to
present (the concert) as a significant threat."
   Mr. Brown, in fact, is surprised by the Forest Service's
sudden solicitousness. "When you look at the insults the
Forest Service was willing to inflict on the owl up until
June 23 (the day it was announced as an endangered species),
certainly the concert pales into insignificance compared with
the habitat destruction from logging and road construction."
   The environmentalists won't find much sympathy at Grim
Bros. Logging, in Estacada. Don Grim has seen big chunks of
Forest Service land taken from his chain saws in order to
spare the spotted owl. He and some friends may now employ a
favorite tactic of the environmentalists. "We're considering
going down there and chaining ourselves across a road," he
says with a laugh. "To protect the owl."
