   MILAN -- Rodolfo De Benedetti, the eldest son of Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti, was named general manager of
Cie. Industriali Riunite S.p.A. (CIR), the family's key
industrial holding company.
   The younger Mr. De Benedetti, 29 years old, will succeed
Corrado Passera in this chief operating position at CIR, the
company said. Mr. Passera resigned from CIR two weeks after
he was named general manager of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore
S.p.A., a publishing company controlled by CIR.
