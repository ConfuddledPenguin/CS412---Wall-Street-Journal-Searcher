   How does an expansion-minded retailer break into the
shopping mall scene? Rebecca Matthias, owner of a chain of
maternity wear stores called Mothers Work, says the scenario
could have been written by Groucho Marx. "The malls are like
an exclusive club," she says. "If you're not a member, you
can't join."
   Mothers Work is in the club. Ms. Matthias opened her first
mall store in 1988. She argued long and hard to persuade a
leasing agent to let her into an upscale mall in King of
Prussia, a suburb of Philadelphia, paying what seemed an
exorbitant rent for just 640 square feet of space in a
dead-end corridor.

   The effort paid off. Business boomed and the store, which
sells apparel aimed at professional working women who are
expecting, got attention. Inquiries from shopping center
developers now pour in so fast that Ms. Matthias has hired a
real estate consultant to sort out the offers. "I get them
every day," she says.
   Ms. Matthias's experience illustrates the quandary that
confronts up-and-coming retailers who want the exposure and
traffic that comes with a mall address. Shopping center
developers, sensitive to the charge that malls look pretty
much the same from coast to coast, are desperate for fresh
retailing concepts. But many developers get nervous when they
see a hot idea coming from a small company without a track
record in mall selling.
   Robert Camp, president of Seattle-based retailer Simpson &amp;
Fisher Co., thinks getting a lease in any top-of-the-line
mall is the best way for a retailer to attract notice from
others. The mall's location isn't critical, he says, because
fiercely competitive developers watch each other constantly.
   Although lease negotiations for mall space "are typically
three months of wrangling," Mr. Camp says he was so eager to
get his second Westminster Lace store into the giant South
Coast Plaza complex in Costa Mesa, Calif., in 1987 that "I
virtually signed the deal as it was presented. I never
negotiated less hard."
   The payoff? "Right away it began opening doors for us,"
Mr. Camp says. Westminster Lace now has 22 stores, all but
one of them in malls. The stores sell apparel and furniture
that use lace.
   Ms. Matthias's eight-year-old Mothers Work had a healthy
mail order and retail business, supported by her own
manufacturing operation, before she set her sights on mall
locations. One rule of thumb is that mall space is roughly
three times more expensive than a comparable street location.
But malls also deliver droves of customers. For her stores,
she says: "You've got to have 1,000 pregnant women walking in
front of your door. Otherwise, you don't have a business."
   Two years after its debut, the King of Prussia store is
generating annual sales of $1,000 per square foot of store
space against rent of $63 a square foot. "Those are pretty
good numbers," Ms. Matthias boasts. The store is now the No.
1 producer among her 27 company-owned stores.
   "Get into one mall," advises Ms. Matthias, who now has 20
Mothers Work mall outlets. "Do whatever you have to. Maybe
it's not the best mall. Maybe you're paying outrageous
rents." With a good sales record, a retailer can put together
a fact sheet that will get the attention of other developers.
"These people don't have the time to really understand your
business," Ms. Matthias says. "They're going to look at a
couple of fact sheets and make a decision."
   Mr. Camp says mall operators have three criteria for
retailers. They want stores that are unique, beautiful and
that outperform the mall average in sales per square foot.
"It's tough if you're another chocolate chip cookie maker,"
he says.
   Handsome store decor can go a long way toward overcoming
developer skepticism, says Fred Simon, president of Omaha
Steak Shops, Omaha, Neb. He says mall operators gave the
thumbs down on his first attempts to lease space, saying:
"This is a fashion court. We don't want a meat store."
   Omaha Steak countered with a design featuring liberal
amounts of oak, tile and marble and large color
transparencies showing meat sizzling on outdoor grills. The
meat itself is tucked away in freezers. "We never show
products in the raw," Mr. Simon says. Omaha Steaks now has
mall locations in Omaha, Dallas and Washington and intends to
expand further in the East, Mr. Simon says.
   In Seattle, Reine Hillis gambled that leasing expensive
retail space in a glitzy downtown shopping arcade for her
upscale men's underwear store would bring calls from mall
developers. "They've found us," Ms. Hillis says.
   Boxer Bay, as her store is known, has secured space in
malls in Denver and Santa Barbara, Calif. Ms. Hillis also
says she has leapfrogged a 10-year tenant waiting list and is
negotiating to lease space in Beverly Center in Beverly
Hills, Calif. Boxer Bay is less than a year old. "We're
moving fast," Ms. Hillis says.
   Although the furious pace of shopping center construction
of the last 20 years has tapered off, in many urban areas the
commercial landscape is dotted with enough malls to give
consumers a choice. New retailing concepts can give a mall
extra pizazz and help set it apart from nearby competitors.
   As a result, the search for new merchandise from small
companies "isn't just an interesting sideline of our
business. It's right at the heart of the business," says
Harwood Beville, executive vice president of the Rouse Co.,
Columbia, Md., which operates shopping centers across the
country.
   For the past 10 years, Rouse has nurtured cash poor
entrepreneurs by letting them sell goods in mobile carts or
stalls in mall locations. Premier sellers can graduate to
leased store space.
   Kristine Brewer started hawking handmade sweaters from
Latin America on a cart in New York City's South Street
Seaport, a Rouse development, and on a street cart outside
Boston's Filene's department store. She says her $500
investment has led to annual gross sales of more than $1
million. Six years later, she has full-fledged stores called
Accento in Rouse markets in Boston and Baltimore, plus stores
in New York and New Orleans.
   "A pushcart is a great way to test your market without
having to invest a lot," says Ms. Brewer. It also tests a
retailer's mettle. "You don't have all the fringe benefits
that a store has, like glass doors and telephones."
   Stephen Plumeri, partner and president of New England
Development, Newton, Mass., says tenure at a mall isn't a
prerequisite with his company. "If a company comes to us cold
with unique ideas and some financial backing, we'll work with
them to put them in our malls." New England Development
operates 15 malls in the Northeast and one in Virginia.
   Barbara Ashley, vice president for retail at the Taubman
Co., a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., mall developer, also says a
mall track record isn't essential to pique developers'
interest. But she adds: "If you can make a business work for
you in a well-respected mall, it can only help."
