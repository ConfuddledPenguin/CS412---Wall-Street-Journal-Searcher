   WASHINGTON -- The House passed a bill requiring
broadcasters to provide children's television programming and
to limit commercial time during children's shows.
   The Senate passed a similar bill last Thursday, but the
Senate version includes a provision to establish a National
Endowment for Children's Educational Television. The
endowment would provide grants for creating and producing
educational shows for children. Differences will have to be
worked out with the House before the bill can be sent to
President Bush.

   It's uncertain whether the president would sign such a
bill. Former President Reagan, citing First Amendment
concerns, vetoed legislation to cap advertising time during
children's shows and to require broadcasters to provide
certain amounts of children's programming.
   The legislation, which passed the House on a voice vote,
requires the Federal Communications Commission to consider a
broadcaster's track record on providing educational and
informational children's programming when the broadcaster's
license comes up for renewal.
   While not threatening a veto, the administration said that
evaluating children's programming as part of the
license-renewal process "raises serious First Amendment
concerns by permitting the government to deny license
renewals if a station doesn't carry what the government views
as adequate programming for children." The administration
also said it opposed capping ad time, saying that limits
could hold down revenues and perhaps even defeat the purpose
of the bill.
   Broadcasters didn't seem to share the Bush
administration's concerns. Instead, they enthusiastically
supported the measures. "The bill protects children from
overcommercialization in their TV and cable programs, while
acknowledging that advertising is what makes these programs
possible," said James C. May, executive vice president,
government relations, for the National Association of
Broadcasters. "It spells out, for the first time in statute
form, broadcasters' public-interest obligations to the child
audience but avoids unnecessary and unconstitutional
programming standards."
   The bills would require broadcasters and cable operators
to limit advertising during children's programming to 10 1/2
minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on
weekdays. The FCC could review and modify those caps after
Jan. 1, 1993.
   Further, the House and Senate legislation directs the FCC
to conduct a study of program-length commercials such as
"G.I. Joe" and "Thundercats," with characters that are sold
as toys.
   The bills don't specify the number of hours that
broadcasters must devote to children's educational shows but
leave the evaluation of quantity and quality of children's
programming up to the FCC at license renewal time.
   "What's going to make this bill work is that it gives a
hook -- to parents, teachers and others who are concerned
about children -- to hang their concerns on," said Peggy
Charren, head of Action for Children's Television Inc. "We
believe that President Bush -- and Mrs. Bush -- will like
it," she said.
   Ms. Charren, who has been working to improve children's TV
for more than 20 years, said the bill was even more necessary
after the Reagan-era deregulation at the FCC. "With
deregulation, what got lost was that television has to be
meaningful for children, too," she said.
   Andrew Schwartzman, head of Media Access Project, a
public-interest law firm, also applauded the legislation.
"I'm sure it will make a difference in programming because it
sends a message that broadcasters must be responsible.
Broadcasters should be concerned less with what they can get
away with and more with how they are going to serve the
public."
