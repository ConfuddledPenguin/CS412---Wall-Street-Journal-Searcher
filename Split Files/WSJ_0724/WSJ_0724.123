   NEW YORK -- Loral Corp. won a bidding contest to buy Ford
Motor Co.'s aerospace unit, beating out competing offers from
a group led by Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a partnership
of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft division and
Alcatel N.V. of Belgium.
   Ford's acceptance of Loral's offer for its Ford Aerospace
Corp. subsidiary, following close bidding, sets the stage for
a transaction valued at about $1.3 billion, according to a
person familiar with the negotiations. The acquisition
furthers Loral's strategy of seeking a larger piece of the
shrinking pie of defense business. Meanwhile, the transaction
will help replenish Ford's cash hoard, which has been eroded
by lower profits, heavy capital spending and its purchase of
the British car maker Jaguar PLC.

   The estimated value of the acquisition includes $811
million in cash and the assumption of Ford Aerospace debt,
letters of credit, and a continuation of health and benefit
plans for the unit's 17,000 employees, according to the same
person. The other bidders were only offering about $750
million in cash, the person said.
   Loral had revenue of $1.27 billion in its fiscal year
ended March 31 and ranks 30th among Pentagon contractors in
terms of value of contracts. It will become the 19th biggest
supplier after it acquires Ford Aerospace, which had 1989
revenue of about $1.9 billion.
   Loral said it has arranged financing for the acquisition
that "won't create a large debt burden for the company."
Loral said it will make the acquisition through a new
corporation owned jointly by two initially equal partners,
Loral and the merchant banking partnerships of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. Each will contribute about $150 million of
equity, Loral said. The balance of the purchase price will be
financed with bank borrowings by the new corporation, but
won't add to Loral's debt obligations. Loral said it will
have the option to later increase its equity in the new
corporation.
   Loral said the acquisition won't dilute its stock.
   The purchase represents the first time in Loral's history
under the acquisitive leadership of Bernard L. Schwartz,
chairman and chief executive officer, that the defense
electronics concern has acquired a company larger than
itself.
   In an interview, Mr. Schwartz said he doesn't foresee any
problems in Loral's digesting Ford Aerospace. "If we thought
it was too much we would have hesitated in going forward," he
said. "We have a history in managing these things."
   He noted that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s aerospace unit
was nearly the size of Loral when Loral bought it for $588
million in 1987. "The advantage of this situation compared to
(the Goodyear Aerospace purchase) is that (Ford Aerospace) is
very profitable. We won't have to put a lot of effort into
turning it around," Mr. Schwartz said.
   Both companies each have order backlogs of about $2
billion.
   Despite assurances by Ford Motor officials that Loral will
maintain overall compensation and benefits "substantially
comparable to those currently in force for Ford Aerospace
employees for two years," personnel at the Newport Beach,
Calif., concern expressed fear about the future. "There are a
lot of negative stories going around," one high-ranking Ford
Aerospace executive acknowledged. "A lot of people are
worried that Loral is heavy-handed in terms of cost-cutting."
   In the interview, Mr. Schwartz sought to dispel such fears
among Ford Aerospace employees, saying he has no plans for
any layoffs at the unit. "We've met all the management at
Ford Aerospace and we think they're good people," he said.
"We think we can create an environment where they'll want to
stay on and (be motivated) to do as good as job as they've
done in the past."
   Ford Aerospace will increase the diversity of Loral, which
has prided itself as a pure defense electronics concern, and
put it into some new businesses such as communications
satellites and air-to-air missiles. Mr. Schwartz said he has
no plans to shed any Ford Aerospace operations. "We're
approaching it on the basis that we're going to make all of
them fit," he said.
   In Pittsburgh, a Westinghouse spokesman said the company
and its partners were "extremely disappointed" and "will
continue to watch the situation with interest." A spokesman
for Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft declined to comment.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton, which is joining Loral in the
acquisition through a partnership, raised the funds for the
partnership in 1989 from a combination of outside investors
and Shearson employees. Shearson recently underwent a
restructuring in which its parent, American Express had to
shore up its balance sheet.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Loral shares closed at $25.375 apiece, down 62.5 cents, while
Ford shares fell 37.5 cents apiece to close at $42.875.
