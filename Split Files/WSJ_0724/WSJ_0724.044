   NEW YORK -- Stocks tumbled steeply in a broad, deep
sell-off triggered mainly by earnings disappointments.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 56.44, or 1.9%, to
2904.70, putting an unmistakable chill on the Dow's
flirtation with 3000. At the depths of the slide, the
industrials were 105.69 points lower. On the way down,
"circuit breakers" were triggered that briefly halted trading
in major stock-index futures contracts in Chicago, which
helped stanch the selling pressure and allowed the Dow
average to rebound 40 points.

   New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 209,030,000
shares. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advancing
stocks 1,430 to 227. Program trading, in which institutional
investors and brokers sell big baskets of stock through
rapid-fire electronic trading systems, accentuated the
sell-off. By 11:15 a.m. EDT, 100 million shares had traded in
orderly fashion on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bad earnings news from several key companies were the main
culprit in the decline, but several other factors also cast a
pall over trading: fears of rising inflation, falling markets
overseas, and financial problems at one of the largest
guarantors of student loans.
   The big rout in stocks lifted U.S. bonds temporarily as
investors sought the safety of Treasury securities. But
eventually the bond market also retreated. The 30-year bond
finished about 1/4 point lower, or down about $2.50 for each
$1,000 face amount.
   U.S. bonds were unable to shake the influence of a big
sell-off earlier yesterday in the Japanese bond market.
Japanese rates can influence those in the U.S. by increasing
the allure of Japanese bonds for Japanese investors. These
investors are less likely to buy U.S. bonds, meaning U.S.
rates must rise to attract other investors.
   Plunging stock prices also sent the dollar tumbling to a
31-month low against the mark and a 27-month low against the
Swiss franc.
   "The dollar was easing off before the stock market plunge.
Then it really accelerated downwards with the stock market
except against the yen," said Andrew Robertson, a vice
president at Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Some analysts termed yesterday's plunge in stock prices a
"correction." But more than a simple shake-out of speculative
excess, yesterday's sell-off marked a reassessment of
earnings growth. "The earnings reports of the past week
served as a cold shower for investors," said James Solloway,
chief economist at Argus Research.
   For about the past nine months, investors have bid up
prices of growth stocks, shares in companies that generate
earnings in tough economic environments because of unique
products and strong franchises. The heights some stock prices
reached seemed to suggest such companies as Home Depot could
somehow keep profits growing no matter how sluggish the
overall economy.
   What resulted was "the most two-tiered market since 1973,"
said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers.
   But last week the romance with growth started to fade.
While the Dow teased the 3000 level, thanks to gains in such
wellknown stocks as Coca-Cola, many other popular stocks were
being pummeled 20% or more over several days because their
second-quarter earnings disappointed highly expectant
investors and analysts.
   On Friday alone, Storage Technology, one of the
best-performing stocks on the Big Board this year, nosedived
34%. The company actually beat analysts' earnings
expectations by 27%, but its forecast of softening U.S.
demand caused institutional investors to dump shares.
   McDonald's, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, continued the pattern. Late Friday, the
restaurant chain's results showed foreign operating profit up
38% in the second quarter, but down 3% in the U.S., said
Joseph Doyle, managing director at Smith Barney. McDonald's
fell 3 to 33 on 4.2 million shares.
   With some companies already indicating that third-quarter
earnings may be weaker than expected, Salomon's Mr. Spence
said shifts in investors' expectations could keep rattling
the market.
   More earnings reports are on the way, and few expect them
to be free of negative surprises. Today, reports are expected
from Dow Chemical, a favored stock among value investors, and
Ingersoll Rand, a popular stock with money managers betting
on a capital spending boom. Other companies expected to
report today include Chevron, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Ryder
System, whose stock is in the Dow Jones Transportation
Average.
   Some analysts caution that the selling may last a day or
two more before investors think stocks are cheap enough to
start buying. However, some stocks that were hammered last
week rebounded; Storage Technology gained 5/8 yesterday to 26
3/8.
   Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns, expects
to see some flight away from technology shares into defensive
blue chips such as Merck and General Electric. "I still think
we are going over 3000, and we are going to do it with high
capitalization blue chips. And we are going to do it within a
month," he said.
   Or are the sellers yet to come? Mutual fund groups
reported little reaction among their shareholders. Vanguard
Group, of Valley Forge, Pa., summoned its money market fund
managers, accountants and lawyers to answer a flood of calls
that never came. "Frankly, they're over there twiddling their
thumbs," said a Vanguard spokesman.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks plunged broadly. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost
1.7% as did the Big Board composite index.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond
rose to 8.55%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar dropped. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6220 marks and 148.20 yen, compared with
1.6365 marks and 148.60 yen Friday.
