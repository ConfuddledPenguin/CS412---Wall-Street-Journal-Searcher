   LYNDHURST, N.J. -- Curtiss-Wright Corp. said
second-quarter net income climbed 6.7% to $7.2 million, or
$1.45 a share, reflecting higher margins in the company's
aerospace segment.
   Revenue rose 8.9% to $56.5 million from $51.9 million a
year earlier. The company, which makes precision parts used
in aerospace, flow-control and other industrial applications,
had net in the year-earlier quarter of $6.8 million, or $1.36
a share. The year-earlier figures were restated to reflect
the cumulative effect of an accounting change.

   The profit would have been greater except for losses at
the company's flow control and marine segment after a
"modest" profit in the first quarter, Curtiss-Wright said.
"The short-term situation in the area of highly engineered
valves remains unsettled," the company said. Despite winning
a number of Navy orders, the available number of orders has
shrunk to their lowest level in a a decade or more, the
company said.
   In the first half, net fell 26% to $11.6 million, or $2.32
a share, from $15.8 million, or $3.16 a share. The decline
reflects recognition of losses in short-term equity
securities, accelerated amortization of nonrecurring non-cash
charges in the first quarter and an upward restatement of
1989 first-quarter earnings. Revenue rose 5.1% to $109.5
million from $104.2 million.
