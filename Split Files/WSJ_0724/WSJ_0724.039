   WASHINGTON -- Congressional foes of U.S. sugar subsidies,
after years of taking their lumps in floor fights, are
invoking the environment and the war on drugs in their battle
against one of the most powerful lobbies in town.
   In a clash that could crystallize the shape of a number of
commodity programs for the next five years, opponents are
making the case that the U.S. policy of curtailing imports of
low-cost sugar so as to prop up domestic sugar prices has
contributed to the boom in Peruvian and Bolivian coca
production and the influx of cocaine into U.S. cities.

   "Throughout the 1980s, (shrinking) U.S. import quotas
pushed the Andean farmer out of sugar while the increase in
cocaine consumption pulled him toward coca," Sen. Bill
Bradley (D., N.J.) asserted in a letter to his colleagues.
   The argument has been embraced by some anti-drug and
law-enforcement groups that are raising their voices in the
current debate over the 1990 farm bill. But sugar-program
defenders dismiss the notion of a sugar-coca connection as
unsubstantiated "trash" and accuse the other side of waging a
"huge misinformation campaign."
   Another fresh argument being circulated on Capitol Hill
goes to perceived environmental repercussions of the sugar
program. The subsidized expansion of Florida's sugar cane
industry is polluting the fragile Everglades, nine
environmental and consumer groups warned in a July 13 letter.
At the same time, lawmakers are being told how coca-leaf
processors are dumping toxic chemicals into the headwaters of
the Amazon River.
   Just how persuasive these arguments are should be known
today when the House and the Senate are due to vote on the
sugar provisions of the $54 billion, five-year farm bill.
Floor fights are anticipated in both chambers.
   "Sugar will be the first real bellwether vote " on the
bill, said a top aide to House Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza (D., Texas). "It will be the first test of
strength" for would-be reformers of the government's vast
subsidy programs.
   The sugar growers are counting on Rep. de la Garza and
other rural members to beat back the attack on sugar once
again. Sugar production is so profitable that another victory
would be worth every cent of the $2.4 million in campaign
contributions that sugar growers and corn-sweetener
manufacturers have given lawmakers since the last farm-bill
vote in 1985.
   But a loss on sugar would give great impetus to plans for
overhauling the peanut, honey and wool-mohair programs and
would strengthen the hand of a reform coalition led by Reps.
Dick Armey (R., Texas) and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who
are intent on outlawing cash subsidies to farmers earning
$100,000 a year or more.
   Today's scheduled votes on sugar, besides gauging the
power of well-heeled political action committees, also will
test the willingness of Congress to put broad consumer
concerns and trade policy objectives ahead of agriculture's
special interests.
   Mr. Bradley calls the current policy of sugar
protectionism "an absolute disaster," adding that "it has
guaranteed high prices to sugar growers at the expense of all
Americans" while depriving poor sugar-producing nations of
export earnings. Every year since 1985, he and other critics
have assailed sugar price supports as "a hidden tax" on U.S.
consumers without ever making any political headway.
   But now Sen. Bradley, Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.) and
other sugar foes are relying heavily on the argument
regarding the sugar-coca connection to line up votes for
their "modest" proposal to lop two cents off the current
support price of 18 cents a pound.
   They base their case mostly on a study by Roberto Abusada,
a prominent Peruvian economist with a Cornell University
doctorate. The study was commissioned by the Washington law
firm of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow, which represents several major
food processors who stand to profit from lower sugar prices.
   Mr. Abusada found, among other things, that the rise of
coca production in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley during the
1980s coincided with the collapse of the sugar industry on
coastal lowlands during the 1980s, and that sugar workers
migrated across the Andes to grow coca in the valley, where
Colombian cocaine traffickers obtain most of their coca
supply.
   U.S. sugar growers hotly challenge this idea. "This really
burns me," said Dalton Yancey, lobbyist for Florida and Texas
sugar cane growers. "It is a big cheap shot" and "a hoax" to
benefit Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow clients. Mr. Yancey contended
that the nationalization of Peru's sugar industry was a
greater factor in its decline than cuts in the U.S. import
quota for Peruvian sugar, and he scoffed at the idea of
Peruvian sugar workers migrating anywhere.
   But several key lawmakers are persuaded of the sugar-coca
link and favor a two-cent cut in the sugar support price,
which would have the effect of letting more foreign sugar
into the U.S. The quota system, said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D.,
Fla.), "just encourages poor nations to raise dope."
   Even a skeptic, Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), chairman
of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said
he sees the need for opening up U.S. markets. "It's very
difficult," he said, "for (Andean) governments to insist on
eradication of the coca crop when they cannot find markets
for substitute crops."
   U.S. sugar growers maintain that the sugar program must be
preserved as long as the European Community insists on
heavily subsidizing sugar production and dumping surpluses on
the world market. But Sen. Bradley and others contend that a
two-cent cut would force the European Community's hand in
negotiations over trade-distorting farm subsidies.
