   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- The value of mergers and acquisitions
proposed in the second quarter plunged 46%, despite a 12%
rise in the number of transactions, as the focus of activity
shifted to sell-offs of "mid-market price range" businesses,
a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. unit says.
   There were 626 M&amp;A deals valued at $30 billion that were
initiated in April, May and June, compared with 561
transactions valued at $56.4 billion in the year-earlier
three-month period, according to W.T. Grimm &amp; Co.

   "The megadeals of the 1980s are no longer the norm," says
Beth Rosencrans, research director at W.T. Grimm.
   The value of corporate combinations proposed in the second
quarter also fell 13% from the $34.3 billion of transactions
begun in the first quarter, as the number of transactions
launched rose 6.8% from 584 in the first three months of the
year, W.T. Grimm says.
   The total value of the 10 biggest transactions announced
in the first six months of 1990, $22 billion, is less than
half the value -- $55 billion -- of transactions announced in
the like 1989 period, W.T. Grimm says.
