   RJR Nabisco Inc., saddled with huge debt expenses, posted
a net loss of $108 million for the second quarter. But the
food and tobacco giant again reported big gains in operating
profit and cash flow.
   RJR, taken private last year in a $25 billion leveraged
buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., had been expected
to post strong operating numbers for the period, and analysts
said the company didn't disappoint.

   Some industry observers said RJR had an additional
incentive to produce a solid second quarter because of its
plan, announced last week, to retire its most troublesome
junk bonds as part of a $6.9 billion refinancing. With
investors, lenders and regulators evaluating the package,
analysts said, strong operating results would only work to
RJR's advantage.
   Karl von der Heyden, RJR's chief financial officer, said
there was "absolutely no attempt to hype" the figures. But he
added that, in light of the recapitalization, the numbers are
"certainly helpful" in "reinforcing the positive impression
that people have" of the New York-based company.
   Among the most significant of those numbers is RJR's debt
coverage, or cash flow as a percentage of total interest
obligations. The figure stood at 1.32 at the end of the
second quarter, up from 1.14 three months earlier and 1.02 a
year earlier.
   "I had been anticipating 1.35 for the full year," said Sam
DeRosa-Farag, a bond analyst with First Boston Corp. in New
York. To reach 1.32 by the end of June, he said, "is
particularly impressive."
   RJR said operating profit in the quarter, after
amortization of trademarks and good will, jumped 34% to $735
million from $547 million a year earlier. The growth was
paced by a 36% increase in operating profit from tobacco, to
$718 million from $527 million. Operating profit from food
rose 3.7% to $199 million from $192 million.
   Mr. von der Heyden noted that operating profits continue
to benefit from cost-cutting measures taken last year,
including the dismissal of 2,300 employees and the move to
consolidate almost all cigarette production in two plants,
down from three. By contrast, he said, spending on marketing
and advertising has increased to about $1.5 billion through
the first half of the year, up about 8% from 1989.
   Revenue in the second quarter rose 4.8% to $3.46 billion
from $3.3 billion a year earlier. Tobacco revenue increased
6.3% to $2.02 billion from $1.9 billion, while revenue from
food rose 2.8% to $1.44 billion from $1.4 billion.
   Domestic tobacco sales rose about 7% to $1.48 billion,
while international tobacco sales increased about 4% to $540
million, Mr. von der Heyden said. Despite the increases, the
No. 2 cigarette maker's share of the U.S. market was "down
slightly" at the end of the second quarter, he added,
primarily because of a drop in sales in RJR's Winston and
Salem brands.
   The $108 million loss for the most recent quarter compared
with a net loss of $319 million in the 1989 second quarter.
"It's possible," Mr. von der Heyden said, "that we may have
positive net income sometime next year. We're getting there.
We're getting closer."
   But RJR's most recent operating gains didn't do much for
the company's widely traded pay-in-kind bonds, which were
dragged down yesterday with the stock market. RJR's 17%
debentures due 2007 fell one point, or $10 for each $1,000
face amount, to close at 94 1/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company's 17 3/8% convertible debentures due
2009 fell 3/4 point to 117.
   For the first half, RJR had a net loss of $330 million,
compared with a loss of $558 million a year earlier. Revenue
rose 7% to $6.66 billion from $6.23 billion. Operating profit
jumped 41% to $1.34 billion from $949 million.
