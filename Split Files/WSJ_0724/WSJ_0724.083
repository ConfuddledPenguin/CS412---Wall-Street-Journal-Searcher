   TIRASPOL, U.S.S.R. -- It is Sunday morning, usually his
day off, but Mayor Igor Smirnov is sitting at his desk in a
defiant mood. He faces three to 10 years in prison for not
flying Moldavia's newly redesigned flag -- with the hammer
and sickle notably absent -- on top of City Hall, he tells a
visiting reporter. But he just won't do it, he says.
   The new flag looks exactly like the flag of neighboring
Romania, and Mayor Smirnov says he has 40,000 constituents
who fought against Romanians allied with Hitler's Germany in
World War II. "They fought against that flag," he says.

   Mr. Smirnov is a 49-year-old Communist Party official and
former factory director who is used to getting his way. He is
a Russian, and Russians aren't used to being ordered around
by members of the Soviet Union's ethnic minority groups. But
that's just what has happened to him and 1.5 million other
Russians and Russian-speaking Ukrainians since February's
elections, when ethnic Moldavians won control of Parliament
in this tiny republic with a total population of 4.5 million.
   The Parliament has labeled Russians like Mayor Smirnov
"occupiers" on Moldavian soil, declared Moldavia's
sovereignty, and changed Moldavia's name to Moldova. And
under a language law enacted last year, Russian speakers in
top positions in government and industry who don't learn the
Moldavian language by 1994 face losing their jobs. Moldavian
is a dialect of Romanian.
   It's "the worst form of nationalism," says the mayor.
   He and fellow Russians, who make up the majority of the
population along the Dneister River industrial belt, have
launched a civil disobedience counterattack. They want to
carve out their own autonomous region, loyal to Moscow
instead of Kishinev, the Moldavian capital.
   Ever since 1940, when the sunny, fruit-growing area then
known as Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from
Romania, Moscow was busy pacifying, industrializing and
"Russifying" the region. Russians and Ukrainians poured into
new industrial areas and dominated top jobs in government and
industry. Moscow used its police-state grip to keep local
animosities in check.
   That structure began buckling under Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost, or openness, policies. In May 1989, three small
Moldavian dissident groups formed the Moldavian Popular Front
and began staging demonstrations in Kishinev calling for
democracy and the adoption of Moldavian as the republic's
official language. One demonstration reportedly drew 500,000
people -- an enormous number in a republic this small.
   By August, the old Parliament felt enough pressure from
the demonstrations to pass a language law, despite a
month-long general strike in Russian-speaking regions to
protest it. Beyond making Moldavian the language of business
and government in the republic, the law requires Moldavian be
written in the Latin alphabet, as it is in Romania, and not
in the Cyrillic script Russians use.
   In February's elections, Russians and Russian-speaking
Ukrainians won only 117 of the 390 seats in Parliament.
(Communist Party members won 83% of the seats, but they are
split along ethnic lines.) The Moldavian majority's first
acts, when Parliament opened in April, were to change the
republic's name and flag.
   Iurie Rosca, a founder of of the Popular Front, says the
Russians are just another ethnic minority group that will
have to learn to get along with the majority or leave.
   No way, says Mayor Smirnov. He and two other Russian
mayors have refused to fly the new flag atop their city halls
or change their Cyrillic signs to Latin lettering. Parliament
tried to pressure them into compliance June 5 by making it a
crime punishable with a jail sentence not to fly the new
flag.
   On June 21, the Tiraspol City Council countered by
declaring the city's own sovereignty. It also declared the
Moldavian flag and language laws invalid "in territories
densely populated with non-Moldavian residents," and said
Tiraspol, henceforth, would be governed by Moscow's laws and
its own, but not those handed down by Kishinev.
   On June 24, the Parliament passed a law declaring invalid
the 1940 treaty under which Stalin annexed Moldavia and
saying that the Russians have been, since then, an illegal
occupation force.
   The Russian parliamentarians hoped for support from
Moscow, but none came. Historian Pyotr Shornikov, an ethnic
Russian delegate from Kishinev, says "the central authorities
are paralyzed." The Russians haven't gotten any help from
local Communist Party officials either. Petru Lucinsci, an
ethnic Moldavian who is Moldavia's party leader, says simply
that the Russians are going to have to be more
"understanding."
   But that isn't easy. Russians like Mr. Shornikov charge
that the Moldavian Popular Front has secret plans to join
Romania. Popular Front officials deny it.
   Russian delegates have problems getting into the
Parliament building. Last May, demonstrators roughed them up
when they tried to enter the building. Since then, barricades
and uniformed police have surrounded the building. After that
incident, some Russian delegates boycotted Parliament
sessions for a month. They were joined by 12 delegates
representing the Gagauze, a tiny Turkic-language minority.
During their absence, the Moldavians in Parliament pushed
through confirmations of ministers, or cabinet officials.
Eleven of 12 such posts went to ethnic Moldavians. They also
passed a resolution supporting Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence.
   Outside Parliament, ethnic tension is ever-present. Last
Nov. 7, several Moldavian Popular Front members were arrested
after they climbed aboard Red Army tanks participating in the
annual Revolution Day parade. Three days later, thousands of
their supporters stormed the Ministry of Internal Affairs
building in Kishinev and set several fires inside. That
touched off a melee between internal security troops and
demonstrators that left 142 troops and 215 demonstrators
injured, according to local press accounts.
   In May, a Russian student was cursed and then beaten to
death by ethnic Moldavian youths simply because he was
speaking Russian in their presence.
   What the Russians have going for them here is the
possibility that the Moldavians will break into various
factions. The Popular Front, which held them all together,
has in recent weeks turned on the Communists in its ranks.
   "I can no longer work with such people," says Mr. Rosca, a
front organizer, of the Communists. His boss is the chairman
of the front, Ion Hadirca. He resigned from the party four
months ago. He used to chair the party-dominated Writers'
Union. A few years ago he won a republic prize for a poem he
wrote entitled, "My Communist Youth Card."
   A moderate in the front, Viorel Ciubotaru, calls Mr. Rosca
a "totalitarian" who is trying to drive non-Moldavians out.
Mr. Ciubotaru is organizing a new party, the centrist Social
Democratic party, and has accused Mr. Rosca of tactics bent
on making non-Moldavians "hate Moldavians."
   Another front defector, Andrei Turcanu, says the
organization is full of radicals who don't understand
democracy. They are bullying the Russians, he says.
   "You can't use the same tactics (in Parliament) that you
used on the street," he says. He's organizing a moderate
Christian Democratic Party.
   At its congress on July 1, delegates of the Moldavian
Popular Front told malcontents to shut up or quit the
movement.
   On the same day, residents of the Russian-dominated city
of Bendery voted 9-1 against flying the new Moldavian flag,
and approved the creation of a Russian autonomous region
along the Dniester River.
