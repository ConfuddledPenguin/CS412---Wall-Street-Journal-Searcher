   LONDON -- Blue Circle Industries PLC, a British building
materials manufacturer, said it agreed to buy the Italian
bathroom hardware manufacturer Ceramica Dolomite S.p.A. for
#36.5 million ($66.3 million).
   Blue Circle said the move is in line with its bid to
expand in Europe. About 75% of Ceramica Dolomite's sales are
in Italy, with the balance made elsewhere on the continent.
