   Chicago Milwaukee Corp. said its board authorized the
purchase of up to $30 million of the company's outstanding
common stock and up to $15 million of its outstanding
preferred stock.
   The Chicago-based holding company said the purchases will
be made from time to time in the open market, subject to
availability, at prices it deems appropriate. A spokesman for
the company said shares purchased will be held in its
treasury and that it hasn't any specific plans for the stock.
