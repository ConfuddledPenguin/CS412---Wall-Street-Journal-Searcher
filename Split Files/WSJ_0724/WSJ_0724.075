   BEIJING -- China's imports in the first half of 1990 fell
by almost one-fourth compared with the like period last year,
a government official said, blaming the drop on economic
sanctions imposed after China's crackdown on last year's
pro-democracy movement.
   China's exports, meanwhile, jumped 22% from the first half
of 1989, totaling $24.5 billion, Liu Xiangdong, spokesman for
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said.
