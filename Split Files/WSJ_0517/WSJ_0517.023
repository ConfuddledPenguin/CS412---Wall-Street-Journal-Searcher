   NEW YORK -- American Insured Mortgage Investors, a real
estate investment program sponsored by Integrated Resources
Inc., said it is seeking to find a new lender for a mortgage
that represents 62% of its portfolio after the borrower
missed two interest payments.
   Integrated's AIM 84 partnership originated the $99.9
million mortgage, which is federally insured, on Windsor
Court, a high-rise rental apartment in Manhattan. AIM decided
to take the action in light of a soft real estate market that
caused the borrower, Mastic Associates, to miss two interest
payments totaling $1.9 million. The remainder of the
portfolio, which totaled $166 million, includes 20 other
mortgages.

   Thomas M. Finn, chief financial officer of AIM Capital
Management Corp., the managing general partner, said AIM 84
would distribute proceeds of the sale to investors in a range
it estimated at $9 to $10 per unit. Investors would continue
to hold an interest in the remainder of the portfolio, which
Mr. Finn said now totals $18 per unit. The partnership, which
is publicly traded, was quoted at $14, up 50 cents, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   If AIM 84 fails to sell the mortgage to a lender in 45 to
60 days, it plans to assign it to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. In that case, AIM 84 would be entitled
to 99% of the mortgage, plus accrued interest minus one
month. Mr. Finn said AIM 84 is negotiating with a lender, but
there isn't any assurance the transaction will be completed,
or completed on these terms.
   Regardless of who is assigned the mortgage, investors will
lose the right to participate in the current cash flow or
residual value of the property.
   In addition, Integrated, which is operating under federal
bankruptcy-law protection, has been trying to sell its
general partnership interest in the AIM series of
partnerships through a court-approved auction. Mr. Finn said
the price Integrated could expect to receive "would be less"
as a result of the mortgage sale, but he didn't quantify the
impact.
   Integrated, which manages more than 600 partnerships, has
been trying to sell assets to satisfy creditors, who are owed
$1.8 billion. Integrated has said it would accept a minimum
bid of $40 million for its interest in four AIM partnerships
sold in the mid-1980s that raised a total of $789 million.
