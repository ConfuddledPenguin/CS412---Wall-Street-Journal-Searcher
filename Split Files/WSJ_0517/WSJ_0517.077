   Yields on money-market mutual funds turned up in the week
ended Tuesday, a delayed reaction to the uptick in short-term
interest rates of a couple of weeks ago.
   The average seven-day compound yield rose to 8% from
7.96%, the highest in more than three months, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.

   Assets of the 428 taxable funds tracked by the Holliston,
Mass.-based newsletter continued to fall, however, to $374.7
billion, their lowest point since mid-January. About $2.3
billion came out of money funds in the latest week, the
seventh consecutive weekly drop.
   Short-term interest rates have come down in the past week,
after rising for a time before that. The three-month Treasury
bill sold at Monday's auction, for instance, yielded 7.93%,
down from 8.06% the week before. But the yield on the
three-month bill was at 8.18% at the April 30 auction, up
from 8.05% the previous week.
   "We're wondering if {money fund} assets will work their
way back up again, now that rates have started to fall," said
Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report. She noted
that some of the cash withdrawn from money funds in recent
weeks probably went to buy higher-yielding Treasury
securities.
   Money-fund yields typically lag behind overall interest
rate trends, as fund managers vary the maturities of their
investments to get the best possible returns. The average
maturity remained at a fairly long 44 days for the fifth
consecutive week, according to Donoghue's, indicating that
there won't be any sharp swings in money-fund yields for at
least the next few weeks. Fund investments include such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
rose to 7.70% from 7.66%. The average 30-day simple yield
remained at 7.68%, while the 30-day compound average stayed
at 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free funds fell for the second consecutive
week. The average seven-day compound yield, for instance,
slid to 5.67% from 5.74%. That's equal to 7.88% for an
investor in the 28% tax bracket and 8.46% for someone paying
taxes at a 33% rate.
   Assets of the 221 tax-exempt funds fell by $262.3 million,
to $75.3 billion. Average maturity shortened by a day, to 41
days.
