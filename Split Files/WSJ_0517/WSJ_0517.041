   Mr. Akerson, who has been executive vice president and
chief financial officer, now is responsible for MCI's seven
domestic operating divisions and related activities.
Previously, each of the division presidents reported directly
to Mr. Roberts. Mr. Akerson, 41 years old, will continue as
chief financial officer until a successor is named, a
spokeswoman said. He was named chief financial officer in
1987. Before that he was president of the company's
Atlanta-based Southeast division.
   Mr. Liebhaber, 55, continues his responsibility for MCI's
technical activities such as engineering, network operations
and systems. Mr. Liebhaber worked for International Business
Machines Corp. for 31 years in various management positions
before joining MCI in 1985.
