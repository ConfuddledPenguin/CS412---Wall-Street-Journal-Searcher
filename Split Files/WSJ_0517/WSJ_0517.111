   Owens-Illinois Inc., taken private in a leveraged buy-out
in 1987, reported a narrower first-quarter net loss on 11%
higher revenue, sending its publicly traded bonds higher.
   All of the company's major businesses -- glass containers,
plastics and closures, specialized glass and health care --
posted "strong" performances, Owens-Illinois said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
