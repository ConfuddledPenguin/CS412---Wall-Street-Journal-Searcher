   MOSCOW -- The Bush administration indicated it may be
unwilling to sign a new treaty liberalizing U.S.-Soviet trade
ties at the coming summit because of Soviet tactics against
independence movements in the Baltic states.
   The new U.S. stand was discussed by U.S. officials
traveling here with Secretary of State James Baker. The
secretary was here for negotiations aimed at settling
arms-control disputes before the planned meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in
Washington later this month.

   But even if the tricky arms-control issues can be
resolved, the summit meeting seems likely to be held under a
cloud caused by the escalating turmoil in the Baltics --
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Specifically, U.S. officials
here have warned the Soviet Union that the trade treaty may
be put off.
   In Washington, President Bush made it clear that the
Baltic issue wouldn't halt the summit itself, or block
arms-control accords. But he added: "I'm unhappy about the
state of play in the Baltics" and conceded that "it has
certainly put some tension on the summit."
   Other administration aides in Washington confirmed that it
is becoming less and less likely that the trade treaty will
be signed at the summit, as once anticipated. One official
said there is a growing belief that the U.S. will have a
"better feel" for whether to go ahead with the pact after the
meeting. This official said that in addition to Baltics
problem, the U.S. is concerned that the Soviet Parliament
hasn't yet passed a long-promised emigration law sought by
Washington as a condition for waiving current U.S.
restrictions on trade with Moscow.
   By threatening to tie trade liberalization to the Baltic
question, the administration is risking removing from the
summit agenda one of the U.S.-Soviet agreements that seemed
most certain to be reached. U.S. and Soviet negotiators have
nearly concluded a trade agreement and the Soviet Parliament
is expected to pass the new emigration law May 31, during the
summit.
   Any decision to withhold better trade ties would be the
first concrete penalty the U.S. has imposed on the Soviet
Union since Moscow imposed an economic blockade on Lithuania
last month.
   The U.S. officials here cautioned that Mr. Bush hasn't
made a final decision on whether to withhold approval from
the trade treaty or the potential waiver of the U.S. trade
restrictions. Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Bush appeared on the
verge of breaking off talks with the Soviets on the trade
treaty, only to back away from the decision at the last
minute. His decision was prompted in part because European
allies were strongly urging him to keep economic talks on
track.
   However, in an interview earlier this week with
Knight-Ridder newspapers, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills warned that "if there is a very strident problem
between the Soviet Union and Lithuania . . . a presentation
of such an agreement to Congress under these circumstances
would not seem to be one that I would recommend." Mr. Baker
told CBS News that "the situation in the Baltics is not
static," and he hinted that the president might drop his
passive stance on the issue if Moscow doesn't agree to
negotiate with the rebel republics.
   A key factor in the administration's toughening stance is
the heavy opposition developing in Congress toward improving
trade relations in the face of the Baltic turmoil. U.S.
officials conceded that the administration takes the
congressional opposition seriously and is stressing it in
private discussions with the Soviets.
   Mr. Gorbachev, who is under severe pressure to improve the
Soviet economy and produce results from his foreign policy,
is believed to eagerly desire trade liberalization as a
political symbol, even though it isn't likely to yield much
direct economic improvement any time soon.
   While the administration is suggesting the trade treaty
might be put in limbo, it is signaling that it will continue
to allow relaxation of economic restrictions on the Soviets
in some other areas. Just yesterday, with the White House's
blessing, the Soviet Union was granted observer status in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based
international organization that oversees world trade.
