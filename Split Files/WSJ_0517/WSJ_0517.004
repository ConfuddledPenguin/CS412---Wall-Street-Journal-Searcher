sold a major portion of its common stock ownership in the
company.
   Laserscope, which makes laser equipment used in surgery,
said Du Pont, the huge Wilmington, Del.-based chemical
concern, acquired a minority equity position in the company
in 1986. Currently two Du Pont executives serve on
Laserscope's board and both will continue to do so, the
company said.
