   WILLIAMSBURG, Ky. -- Pat Sulfridge was married at age 14
and pregnant at 15. Today, at 32, she is single again,
supporting herself and three children on a $250 monthly
salary, plus welfare payments and foodstamps. Her electric
bill hasn't been paid in months, and her six-year-old son,
Brandon, can wiggle his toes through his torn blue sneakers.
To deal with the stress, she chain-smokes Winston 100s and
gulps down instant coffee.
   Yet for many of her fellow women here without a man in the
household, Ms. Sulfridge is a role model. She works part-time
as a social-service counselor.

   On the job one day recently, she is sitting beside a coal
stove in a blue shack tucked deep among the pines off Red
Bird Road, visiting a 16-year-old girl who has threatened to
run away. The girl, smoking cigarettes and combing knots from
her blond hair, talks of her school troubles and her fears
that her stepfather, who once dragged her by the hair across
the living room floor, may return to the house and beat her.
   Ms. Sulfridge comforts her and urges her to stay in
school. "Read everything you can find," she says. And, she
pleads: "Be a child before you have a child." As the sun
slips behind the Cumberland Mountains, Ms. Sulfridge climbs
into her rusty 1982 Pontiac Phoenix, frustrated that she
can't do more for the girl. "If these kids give up," she
says, "we've lost the battle."
   Long the heart and soul of Appalachia, women like Pat
Sulfridge are becoming its backbone too. Here in Whitley
County, which is mostly white, nearly one in three households
is headed by a woman. That is double the national average,
and fast approaching the proportion of the nation's black
families that are headed by women -- 44%.
   When Ms. Sulfridge checks in at the food-stamp office for
her monthly rations, only women join her in line. At the
Wal-Mart, about the only men she sees are a few retirees
waiting for prescriptions. "It's the mamas who are fighting
for their families," she says. "Surely to goodness, there are
some good men in this county, but I don't know where they
are."
   Carol M. Straus, a University of Kentucky researcher who
has studied Kentucky women in poverty, says, "It's becoming
less and less likely that an Appalachian woman can rely on a
man for support of herself and children." The same holds true
in poorer places elsewhere in the country. Says Sylvia
Hewlett, a New York economist: "The inner-city model has
moved into white, blue-collar communities. If you're a
25-year-old white woman, you have a 40% chance of being a
single mother."
   Not that mountain women could ever depend on men for a
steady income. Work in the region's coal mines, tobacco
fields and logging camps was always erratic. But in these
remote hills and hollows, families hung together. The region
has been physically and culturally isolated for generations.
Even though highways now link mountain communities, the
hollows remain off-limits to outsiders and their notions of
women's liberation. So generations of women have lived a
traditional life, dropping out of school to marry and raise a
brood of youngsters.
   They depended on fathers, brothers and cousins, who
usually lived close by, to help support them in hard times.
They deferred to their husbands. At mealtimes, they fed the
men first, and then the children. Wives often gulped their
own meals while clearing the dishes. "Men had the right to
tell you when to go to bed and when to get up," says Edith
Parrett, a 59-year-old native of neighboring Clay County.
"Women have been second-class citizens."
   The men have been leaving these parts for the big cities
of the Midwest or California, or simply to drift, at a faster
rate than their women. Virtually every local industry has
automated or retrenched; employment in Kentucky coal mines
has dropped 40% to just 29,500 in the past decade. In Whitley
County, with a population of 35,600, there are only about
1,200 manufacturing jobs, and even minimum-wage work in
fast-food restaurants or retail stores is scarce.
   One of those who left was Ms. Sulfridge's husband.
   The life she has led since is not what she expected
growing up as the sixth of nine children in a rural Whitley
County family. Her family lived on a tiny farm in a wooden
shack without plumbing. But her parents stayed together. They
still milk the cows together, and they celebrated their 46th
wedding anniversary this year. "They share the struggles,"
Ms. Sulfridge says.
   Two of her siblings left Kentucky for work in California
and Michigan. The others remained to work in the mines. Ms.
Sulfridge's childhood sweetheart was Reese Sulfridge, who
attended vocational school and talked of college and studying
architecture. She dropped out of the 10th grade to marry him.
"He seemed ambitious," she says.
   Instead of going to college, Mr. Sulfridge took
construction jobs to support his bride and their first child,
Patty. Several times they went to Michigan and Ohio to search
for factory work but always were drawn back to Kentucky to be
close to family. By 1983, they had two more children, Shawnda
and Brandon. In most years Mr. Sulfridge's seasonal work
earned him less than $4,000. Ms. Sulfridge took part-time
jobs cleaning houses and serving food at Pizza Hut.
   In their best year, Mr. Sulfridge earned about $10,000 at
the Williamsburg water plant. "We felt rich," Ms. Sulfridge
says. But the job didn't last. Mr. Sulfridge, unemployed,
went "bowling, fishing and hunting," she says. Then, she
says, the drinking and arguing began. Once they separated
when, she says, he told her she couldn't spend $25 to buy
Patty a blue-jean jacket. "Every $1.25 he laid up on a bar
could've helped buy a pair of shoes for the kids," she says.
"To think I once dreamed of growing old and sitting in
rocking chairs together."
   About 18 months ago, the couple divorced. Since then Ms.
Sulfridge has received just $80 in child-support payments. In
Kentucky, only $2.68 in support payments is collected for
every $1 spent to track missing fathers, according to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Sulfridge,
one of those who is often missing, couldn't be reached for
comment. Ms. Sulfridge says he has dropped by to visit from
time to time, but she doesn't know where he lives.
   Ms. Sulfridge was forced to move to cheaper quarters
several times in the past 18 months. She has lived in a
cramped trailer and a dilapidated house so leaky that snow
fell on her face as she slept. She recently found a modern,
three-bedroom house with a front yard where two puppies can
run with the kids. The rent is cheap because the house is
about a dozen miles away from the nearest town. Ms. Sulfridge
is redecorating one bedroom by covering a wall with a roll of
navy and pink flowered wallpaper purchased for $1.
   A tall, thin woman who looks older than she is, Ms.
Sulfridge shops at yard sales and shares pairs of second-hand
blue jeans with Patty, now 17 years old. Walking through a
Wal-Mart one recent morning, Ms. Sulfridge finds that her
budget allows only one purchase: a $1.77 container of roll-on
deodorant. When she spots a penny in the parking lot, she
picks it up and pockets it. "I need all the luck I can get."
   Since her husband left, she has taken odd jobs. She has
scrubbed floors and stood in cold barns for 12-hour shifts,
stripping tobacco. "I'll beg, borrow or steal to take care of
my kids," she says.
   What's sustaining her now is a community of other single
mothers. With so few men left in the region, she doesn't
expect to remarry -- nor does she especially want to. But she
has found help and an extended family at the Whitley County
Communities for Children, a woman-run, grant-supported group
that offers training in such diverse areas as raising
livestock, counseling teen-agers and running computers.
   Ms. Sulfridge first went there for tutoring for a
high-school equivalency degree. Then she was hired as a
part-time counselor. Several days a week, she and other
single mothers travel the dirt roads of Whitley County,
visiting girls like the teenager living in the blue shack.
   "I probably wouldn't have made it if not for these people
here," she says.
   At lunch, one woman prepares a salad in a large bowl to
feed a score of volunteers and staff. Near the kitchen, a
dozen toddlers play as mothers take turns providing daycare.
A loom in the corner of the room displays a half-finished
blue rug, which will soon be sold to raise funds for the
center.
   After lunch, several women pile into Ms. Sulfridge's used
Pontiac to locate teenagers who might want after-school
tutoring. She and her friends depend on her car because there
is no public transportation in the region. The drive to a
doctor's office or job is often 30 miles or more. The women
chip in for gasoline. Some have never learned to drive
because their husbands never let them.
   Driving through the rugged countryside, they pass wooden
shacks with chickens darting through littered yards filled
with empty milk cartons and other garbage. "That white house
over there is where a grandmother is raising her 25
grandchildren," says a passenger in the car. "And a
bootlegger lives over there," she whispers. Whitley County is
legally dry.
   Thin plastic rather than glass covers the windows of many
homes. "I'm poor and I've had a hard time," Ms. Sulfridge
says. "But there are kids living here who've never even had a
$3 Happy Meal at McDonald's."
   The women can't find the teen-agers who had asked them to
visit, and turn back toward home. On the way, they stop for
Cokes and other small purchases, paying with food stamps.
After dropping each of her passengers off, Ms. Sulfridge
hurries to pick up her three children at school. They get
nervous when she is late. Since her husband left, her son
Brandon often wakes up at night yelling, "Where's Mom?"
   "These kids hang on to me like a leech," Ms. Sulfridge
says. "I can't start to the store without them asking, `Where
are you going and when will you be back?'"
   Sandwiches make tonight's dinner. Afterward the table is
clear and dishes promptly washed. Seventeen-year-old Patty
works quietly at the table, rewriting stories for her
high-school yearbook. She will graduate with an A average
this month and hopes to win a scholarship for college.
   Patty has never worn a new dress to a prom, and she
doesn't expect one for graduation, either. But she would like
to send out graduation announcements, and asks her mother if
there is any money. Ms. Sulfridge silently studies the order
form. Then Shawnda asks her mother how to dress for her role
as Mother Mouse in a school play, and Brandon brings out the
coloring books and crayons. He mischievously shows a visitor
how to pick the bathroom lock with a pocket knife. "My Dad
gave me this," he brags.
   At 11 p.m., after the children have gone to bed, Ms.
Sulfridge tackles a heap of laundry and talks of her hopes
for her children. "I hope they get an education and do
something with their lives," she says. Then, she says, she
hopes to go to college herself and become a nurse. She also
confides that she has stashed away a few dollars to order
Patty's graduation announcements. "Some things," she says,
"are too important to do without."
