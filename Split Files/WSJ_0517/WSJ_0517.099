   NEW YORK -- While U.S. stocks and bonds have surged in
recent days, the dollar has fallen from its lofty perch.
   With U.S. interest rates sinking, the dollar has slumped
5% the past month against the yen and 3% against the mark.

   The U.S. currency may have farther to fall, economists
say. But they don't expect the dollar's troubles to hurt the
U.S. stock and bond markets.
   In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 151.67 yen. That was up 0.87 yen from Tuesday's level, but
down substantially from the 12-month high of 159.79 yen
earlier this spring. The dollar inched downward to 1.6455
marks from 1.6465 marks the day before. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6805, up from $1.6740 Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 152.23 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
151.95 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6415
marks.
   "The dollar continues to be vulnerable against the yen,"
says Robert Chandross, an economist at Lloyds Bank PLC in New
York.
   Like most traders and economists, Mr. Chandross is
focusing on inflation-adjusted, "real" interest rates in the
U.S. and other big industrial nations. By that analysis, the
dollar has become a lousy resting place for global investors'
cash.
   After allowing for inflation, U.S. long-term interest
rates of 8.8% currently provide investors with a 3.6% real
return. That's about the lowest real return of the U.S.'s
major trading partners. By comparison, Japan's real interest
rates are about 4.5%, France's are 6.3%, and West Germany's
about 6.2%.
   "This unfavorable real yield comparison is the main factor
behind the weakening of the U.S. dollar," says Hung Tran, a
research director at Deutsche Bank AG's New York office.
   Earlier this year, the dollar had strengthened on
expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise U.S.
interest rates to fight inflation. But the Fed in recent
weeks has indicated that it isn't likely to tug rates upward.
That has left traders and economists convinced that the
current global interest-rate gaps are likely to last awhile.
   "All the central banks are on hold," says David Germany,
an economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "Nothing tells me that
the dollar's sag will be interrupted short-term."
   Longer term, though, Mr. Germany sees the dollar
rebounding on the strength of growing exports, a healthy
domestic economy and an eventual boost in U.S. interest
rates.
   The dollar's latest jitters have reminded some market
participants of the 1985-87 period, when sudden drops in the
dollar repeatedly led to brief plunges in U.S. stock and bond
markets. At those times, Japanese and other foreign investors
stopped buying U.S. securities.
   But economists aren't biting their nails now. "I wouldn't
expect any movement out of the dollar to be of a magnitude
that would cause a panic or an abandoning of U.S. financial
assets," says Mr. Tran.
   Japanese investors, in particular, simply aren't as
crucial to the U.S. securities markets anymore. Last year,
Japanese investors bought $3.3 billion of U.S. stocks,
according to the Securities Industry Association, down from a
record $11.3 billion in 1987. They bought $2.3 billion of
Treasury bonds last year, down from a record $21.8 billion in
1988. Stocks and bonds both gained anyway in 1989, without a
major Japanese boost.
   "Foreign investors -- led by the Japanese -- have shifted
from being portfolio investors in U.S. stocks and bonds to
making direct investments in the U.S.," says Deutsche Bank's
Mr. Tran. For the first half of 1989 alone, Japan invested
more than $9 billion in U.S. plants and equipment, real
estate, corporate acquisitions and other forms of direct
investment, according to the Bank of Japan. Such assets, Mr.
Tran observes, aren't likely to be sold quickly just because
of a short-term drop in the dollar's value.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for
current delivery settled at $369 an ounce, down $1.90.
Estimated volume was a light 1.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $369.25 an
ounce.
