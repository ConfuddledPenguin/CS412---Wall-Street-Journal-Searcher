   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court decision this week
dealt a significant blow to the Federal Reserve Board's
regulatory power and may raise questions about the basis of
some other important tools the Fed uses in overseeing
bank-holding companies.
   The decision, handed down by the appeals court in New
Orleans, invalidated the Fed's "source-of-strength" policy,
under which bank-holding companies are required to help their
ailing bank subsidiaries by providing them with cash or other
assets.

   The ruling doesn't by any means leave the bank-holding
companies unregulated by the Fed. And last year's savings and
loan association bailout bill makes the companies'
subsidiaries liable for losses to the government from other
banking subsidiaries. However, the decision is a major
setback to the Fed's moves in recent years to expand the
purview of its regulation from the holding company to the
entire banking organization.
   The decision came in a challenge by MCorp, a Dallas
bank-holding company. The government took over 20 failed
MCorp subsidiaries last year, at an expected cost of $2
billion, and the Fed moved against MCorp to recoup some of
the losses. But the New Orleans court said the Fed's reach
didn't extend that far.
   "The Fed must be reeling from this," said Robert Litan, a
banking expert at the Brookings Institution here. "They've
often trotted this policy out as an arm twister."
   "It's a significant loss for the Fed," said Richard
Whiting, general counsel of the Association of Bank Holding
Companies. "I would assume they will appeal it." A spokesman
said the Fed wouldn't comment on the decision until the board
meets on the issue. The fifth circuit covers Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas, but the decision is sure to be cited
as a precedent in other circuits.
   Most holding companies do move to help troubled units, if
only because of public perception. "Most bankers regard
themselves as bound by the source-of-strength doctrine," said
Michael Bradfield, a former Fed general counsel who oversaw
an important 1987 Fed policy statement outlining the
doctrine.
   "Remember what Walter Wriston, the famous {former} head of
Citicorp said: `If Citicorp's name is on the door, I'm going
to bail it out no matter what the lawyers say,' " said Mr.
Bradfield, who also was involved in the MCorp case while he
was at the Fed.
   Some analysts believed the court decision ends uncertainty
over the limits of financial exposure for holding companies
that buy banks or thrifts. "A buyer would think he is buying
a big, black hole that could absorb his last penny," said
Karen Shaw of the Institute for Strategy Development, a
Washington consulting firm.
   Mr. Litan of Brookings also said the decision -- which
found that the Fed had gone too far in arguing that its legal
power to stop "unsafe and unsound" banking practices
supported the source-of-strength doctrine -- had implications
for the other important Fed powers, such as the capital
requirements that the Fed imposes on bankholding companies.
   The appeals court decision, by Judge W. Eugene Davis,
approvingly quoted a statement by the Shadow Financial
Regulatory Committee, a group of academics, bankers, and
attorneys, that "while Congress has empowered regulators of
banks to issue capital directives to the institutions in
their charge, it has not authorized the Fed to issue capital
directives to bankholding companies."
   But Mr. Whiting said the Fed maintains that legislation
going back more than 10 years supports its power to mandate
the capital requirements. And Mr. Bradfield, the former Fed
general counsel, said it was "comical" that the court quoted
the shadow committee, partly because John Hawke, a lawyer for
MCorp in the matter, is a member of the group. "I find it
strange that the court is quoting plaintiff's counsel as an
expert," he said. Mr. Hawke was out of the country and
couldn't be reached.
   While the Fed has rarely invoked the source-of-strength
policy explicitly, bank attorneys say the Fed has used the
threat of the policy as leverage to induce bankholding
companies to take various actions sought by the regulators.
   The appeals court left the Fed a loophole, Mr. Bradfield
said, in saying the Fed "could possibly" require holding
companies to maintain subsidiaries "to some degree of
financial soundness." But how such agreements would work in a
situation like MCorp's, in which the units no longer belong
to the holding company, is unclear.
