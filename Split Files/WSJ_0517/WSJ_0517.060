   Subway Beggars Do Have a Message: Desperation

   Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin lived in the 1700s, and he
was an army officer, a statesman, and a lover of Catherine
the Great. Given that combination, he was for many years the
most powerful man in her empire. In 1787, when Catherine
toured the newly conquered Crimea, Potemkin is said to have
ordered the construction of sham villages, facades made of
cardboard, so that she would think all was well as she passed
through.
   Now, 200 years later, we have his ideological descendants
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Their
names are Francis Altimari and William Timbers, and last week
they built a Potemkin Village of their own: They ruled that
in the world of New York's subways, there's no such thing as
a beggar.

   Anyone who goes down into a New York subway station, who
stands on a subway platform or who rides in a subway car
knows the system is peopled by beggars, many of them
homeless, most of them harmless, some of them frauds. These
people are desperate. Some are belligerent. Many are
aggressive. Few are polite. Together, they are a constant
reminder of the social problems besetting New York --
hopelessness and homelessness, disease and despair.
   Last fall, the agency that runs the subway system began
enforcing a longstanding ban on begging and panhandling in
the stations and on the trains. The Legal Center for the
Homeless sued on behalf of itself and two homeless men,
arguing that begging is a form of expression, a form of
speech, and that to ban begging is to violate the First
Amendment to our Constitution.
   The federal district court agreed.
   "A true test of one's commitment to constitutional
principles," Judge Leonard Sand wrote, "is the extent to
which recognition is given to the rights of those in our
midst who are the least affluent, least powerful and least
welcome."
   And no American is less affluent, less powerful or less
welcome than a beggar on the subway.
   Less welcome, especially, to the people who run the subway
agency. They appealed. And last week, in a two-to-one
decision, they won. Judge Sand was overruled.
   Beggars have no message, Judges Altimari and Timbers
wrote. They just want money. And that just threatens,
harasses and intimidates the 3.5 million people who use the
subways every working day, the judges said. Beggars, they
said, are "a menace to the common good."
   It's true that some beggars do threaten, harass and
intimidate. It's true, too, that it's hard to avoid an
aggressive beggar in the confines of a subway car. But the
beggars just want into the system, not necessarily into the
cars. They simply want the same rights given to solicitors
from organized charities, men and women who are allowed that
form of begging in certain areas of the city's 468 subway
stations.
   What is the distinction? A crippled beggar shaking a cup
is crying out every bit as much as the man primly carrying a
sign asking for contributions to save the rain forests. A
disheveled woman with a makeshift sign saying "I am homeless"
is communicating every bit as much as the well-dressed woman
politely asking for help to finance an anti-abortion group. A
wild-eyed man demanding help has a message every bit as
important as the message from the clean-scrubbed collegian
seeking money for animal rights.
   The distinction is this: The crippled beggar, the
disheveled woman, the wild-eyed man reflect the ills of
everyday life rather than the campaigns of everyday life.
We'll deal with causes, but we don't want to see ills. That,
at least, appears to be the distinction drawn by the transit
agency and upheld by the court.
   It's a sad distinction, and a wrong one.
   "In the seclusion of a judge's chambers, it is tempting to
assume that beggars could obtain jobs and spend their free
time distributing leaflets or buttonholing passersby in the
subway to further the cause of the homeless and poor," Judge
Thomas Meskill noted in dissent. But that is not the real
world. Beggars beg because they are desperate. They are
desperate for food, or shelter, or clothing, or medicine. For
attention. For help.
   No one knows how many beggars there are, or homeless, but
in New York City they are everywhere. They are in the parks
and the doorways, on the sidewalks and in the gutters. They
carry signs, they push shopping carts, they nurse babies.
   These men and women are speaking out in actions as well as
words, and their begging is probably saving their lives. It
is their job, in effect, their means of livelihood. They have
been stripped of all but that most precious possession,
freedom -- freedom to speak, to seek help, to broadcast their
woes, to make you uncomfortable.
   But now, in New York, they have been stripped of that
freedom, too. Now, the subways, teeming and steaming, will be
free of those pesky beggars begging for their lives.
   Catherine the Great would feel right at home.
