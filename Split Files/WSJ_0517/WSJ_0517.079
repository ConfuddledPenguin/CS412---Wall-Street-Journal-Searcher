   Pravda, the official Soviet Communist Party newspaper, has
turned downright capitalistic: It is about to throw its pages
open to U.S. advertisers.
   Pravda, which has almost never accepted advertising from
the West or anywhere else, began contacting more than 150 of
the nation's largest companies earlier this week, offering
them the chance to advertise in the Communist Party organ for
$50,000 a page. In a letter sent to chief executive officers,
I.N. Filipov, a Pravda representative, says the paper will
accept ads in conjunction with Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to
the U.S. in early June. The paper's goal: to make some money
off Western companies looking to break into perestroika-era
Soviet turf.

   "We must acknowledge that American corporations are
unknown to the Soviet public in general," Mr. Filipov says in
the letter. "Pravda is certainly the most influential
newspaper in the U.S.S.R. . . . Mr. Gorbachev himself starts
his day with reading Pravda," he adds.
   While the letter is tied to Mr. Gorbachev's visit to the
U.S., Pravda's push for U.S. advertisers isn't a one-shot
deal. "The plan is to start this on a regular basis," says
Victor Linnik, Pravda correspondent in New York who's
doubling as sales agent as the paper dips its toes into
advertising. Pravda "has been too slow in realizing the world
is new, it's changed, and we'd better think hard about the
commercial side of our business -- which actually we never
have," he says.
   Pravda follows the lead of Izvestia, the official
government newspaper, which began running Western advertising
in January. Pravda, though, appears to be the more aggressive
of the two. Mr. Linnik says that calls and letters went out
Tuesday to just about every major corporation you could name,
including the big oil companies, Procter &amp; Gamble,
McDonald's, Philip Morris, Gillette and PepsiCo.
   Response, however, has been mixed. A Philip Morris
spokeswoman says, "We would consider doing something" in
conjunction with Mr. Gorbachev's visit, "but what that could
be -- a corporate welcome down to a product ad -- I don't
know." Philip Morris, which owns General Foods and Miller
Brewing, has never advertised before in the Soviet Union.
   A Gillette marketing executive also expressed interest,
Pravda's Mr. Linnik says. Boston-based Gillette announced in
January that it may build a razor and blade factory in the
Soviet Union in a joint venture with a Soviet manufacturer.
But a Gillette spokeswoman says the company's interest in
advertising in the Soviet Union is "down the road. . . . We
can't even put a timetable on it."
   Some U.S. ad executives, though, expressed skepticism
about advertising in Pravda or elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
Most Western products and services aren't available there.
And for those that are, few Soviets have the hard currency
needed to buy them.
   What's more, ad executives say other Eastern European
countries are likely to open to Western businesses more
quickly than the Soviet Union. "The Eastern European economy
-- Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia -- seems to have more
entrepreneurial energy. It seems more likely to open up {to
Western advertisers} before the Soviet Union," says John
Bernbach, president of Omnicom's DDB Needham ad agency, whose
clients include Seagram and H.J. Heinz. "I'm not aware of any
of our clients that have immediate plans to go into the
Soviet Union."
   Some companies were just plain baffled by Pravda's
approach. Mr. Filipov's missive is a form letter faxed to
executives, some of whom weren't sure if it was real. The
letter offers "a chance to publish in Pravda a journalistic
story about your corporation including your own interview,
your ad and photographs of your products." It also tells
advertisers to "contact us immediately" so it can send a
correspondent. One executive at a Fortune 500 company says
she received a call from a Pravda representative but
dismissed it, because "I thought it was a joke."
   Pravda's Mr. Linnik, though, says that Pravda is selling
advertising, not news stories. The letter offers to send a
correspondent, he says, only because companies may need help
translating their ads.
   Pravda's quoted ad rate of $50,000 a page compares
favorably with that of U.S. publications. Pravda's
circulation is more than eight million, Mr. Linnik says. The
New York Times, whose Sunday edition has a circulation of 1.7
million, charges about $53,000 for a Sunday page. The Wall
Street Journal, with daily circulation of 1.9 million,
charges about $99,000 for a full page. Pravda, however, is
learning from its capitalist brethren quickly: The Pravda ad
rate, Mr. Linnik hastens to say, is "just a start-up price."
   Before it plunged into advertising itself, Izvestia
published an article last year saying that "Western
advertising could be very useful." Some Western companies
have been coming up with ingenious schemes to make themselves
household words. Pepsi created a flurry of publicity by
advertising on Soviet TV, for example, while the name
Olivetti flashes on TV screens for a full minute before the
main evening news program, superimposed on a ticking clock.
   "The Soviet Union these days looks like a giant potential
market," says Pravda's Mr. Linnik, acting in his new ad sales
role, "so I don't really think any of the serious-minded
companies would pass this opportunity -- or should, for that
matter."

   Lintas to Buy Small Shop
                                                                                                       

   Lintas: USA agreed in principle to acquire Hawley Martin
Partners, a tiny Richmond, Va., agency headed by David
Martin, who was previously chairman of Richmond's Martin
Agency.
   Hawley Martin, which has billings of $25 million, will
operate independently as a subsidiary of Lintas, which is a
unit of Interpublic Group. Terms of the transaction, a cash
deal, weren't disclosed.
   Mr. Martin left the Martin Agency, which he founded in
1965, last year, saying the shop had its "management team in
place and it was ready to roll." That agency, which is owned
by Scali, McCabe, Sloves, has gained notice as one of the
more creative regional agencies.
   "The Lintas connection expands our ability to serve
clients in our particular part of the world with greater
resources," said Mr. Martin, Hawley Martin's chairman. Hawley
Martin clients include Eskimo Pie Corp. and Riggs National
Bank.

   AUDIT BUREAU: The Audit Bureau of Circulations, which
traditionally audits just paid-circulation magazines,
yesterday said it will begin verifying the nonpaid
circulations of consumer magazines. The bureau said it was
expanding its practices because of requests for more detailed
information from its magazine members and from advertisers.
                                                                                                       

   DELLA FEMINA: Bank of Boston consolidated its ad account
at Della Femina, McNamee WCRS's Boston office. Eurocom's
Della Femina, which already handles the bank's flagship
offices, was named to create ads for its subsidiaries,
including Bank of Vermont and Bank of Boston/Connecticut.
Billings weren't disclosed.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNTS: NutraSweet Co., a unit of Monsanto, named
Chiat/Day/Mojo, Los Angeles, to create ads for a new
undisclosed product. . . . MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom
International, named Weiss, Whitten, New York, to create
campaigns introducing lines of MTV clothing, sunglasses and
other products. Billings weren't disclosed.
