   LONDON -- Grand Metropolitan PLC's pretax profit jumped
36% in the six months ended March 31, helped by strong
results from its Pillsbury Co. and Burger King Corp. units.
   The British food-and-drinks concern posted pretax profit
of #409 million ($685 million) in the fiscal first half, up
from #301 million in the year-earlier period. Chairman Allen
Sheppard said the better-than-expected performance of
Pillsbury and Burger King "has reinforced our conviction that
the acquisition will be earnings-positive in its first full
financial year." Grand Met bought the Pillsbury food group,
including its Burger King fast-food chain, for $5.75 billion
in January 1989.

   Although Grand Met's first-half earnings exceeded
analysts' forecasts, the company's shares fell on London's
Stock Exchange yesterday against an overall rising market.
Grand Met shares traded late yesterday at 574 pence ($9.61),
down 13.
   Analysts attributed the decline to concerns about Grand
Met's debt level after the Pillsbury acquisition, and to fear
of so-called mad-cow disease. Shares in U.K. food companies
have generally slipped this week amid reports that British
cattle are infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE. Worries about the disease, which causes cattle to
stagger and foam at the mouth, have prompted some U.K.
schools and hospitals to cut beef from their menus.
   British government officials contend that U.K. beef is
safe to eat. Ian Martin, chief executive officer of Grand
Met's food sector, told a news conference yesterday that the
company already uses mostly non-British beef in its U.K.
chain of Berni steakhouses. But Mr. Martin said that Grand
Met is watching the situation closely, and if necessary could
find alternative supplies for British beef within two days.
He added that it was too early to say whether the steakhouses
have suffered any decline in business because of the scare.
   Grand Met's net profit attributable to shareholders,
including extraordinary items, rose 8% to #781 million from
#723 million. Per-share earnings climbed 25% to 28.6 pence
from 22.9 pence. Sales rose 23% to #4.97 billion from #4.04
billion; sales from continuing operations rose 42% to #4.7
billion from #3.3 billion.
   The fiscal first-half results were raised by property
sales, which earned a profit of #44 million, more than double
the #21 million earned from property sales a year earlier.
Grand Met also had an extraordinary gain of #499 million
arising from the sale of its William Hill and Mecca
betting-parlor operations, down from the #518 milion in
extraordinary gains a year earlier.
   Some analysts expressed disappointment at the scale of
property-sale profit and extraordinary gains. But they
generally agreed that Grand Met's core businesses are
operating well.
