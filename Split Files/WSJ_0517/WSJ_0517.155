   Circle K Corp., fighting to stay competitive in the
nation's convenience-store wars, is about to revamp its
corporate culture, product mix and pricing strategies in an
attempt to lure back former customers and attract new ones.
   Industry analysts say that's a tough-enough trick for the
second-largest U.S. convenience-store chain to pull off in an
industry overcrowded with clones. Now it will have to carry
out the massive changes while jousting with creditors and
dealing with the complexities of the bankruptcy-court system
after filing Tuesday night under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code. The filing was made after major bank lenders
refused to compromise on terms of a financial restructuring.

   Circle K got into its present mess by expanding too fast
and taking on $1.1 billion in below-investment-grade junk
debt to buy and open additional stores. But it also committed
two of retailing's biggest blunders: It charged its customers
prices well above the competition, assuming they wouldn't
care; and it offered them lots of high-profit-margin products
they didn't want, cutting back on old standbys that brought
people in the door.
   That harsh critique comes from none other than the
company's president, Robert A. Dearth Jr., who says he's
determined to change all that and reposition the company so
that it can return to profitability and pay its debt.
   "Before, we had the attitude of gouging the customer for
what we could get," says Mr. Dearth, who took over in January
at the chain, based in Phoenix, Ariz.
   The executive plans to change things by slashing overall
prices 10% by the start of summer, revamping product lines
and starting a massive "long-term" frequent-buyer program.
He's also planning a giveaway program, with more than $100
million in prizes aimed at luring customers back to the
chain's 4,600 stores. But he hasn't any intention of
downsizing the company or laying off any of Circle K's 27,000
employees.
   Whether or not company creditors, seeking to preserve
assets, will agree to such a spending spree remains to be
seen; but initial signs are positive. "We would encourage any
plan that generates income. We believe this {marketing} plan
probably will," says one of Circle K's bank creditors.
   Others, however, are skeptical about any repositioning in
what has become a fiercely competitive industry. "It takes
money to reposition inventory. It takes money to do
giveaways. It's pretty dubious whether the bankruptcy judge
will stand for this," says Dennis Telzrow, a
convenience-store analyst with Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner. "I
don't know where they will get the money," adds Mr. Telzrow,
who expects the company's troubles will force it to sell 10%
of its stores.
   Already, Circle K's major competitor, Southland Corp.'s
7-Eleven stores, has tried drawing customers with car
giveaways. In addition to giving away a BMW, another
competitor, National Convenience Stores Inc., briefly
instituted a frequent-buyer program two years ago. Customers
received Black &amp; Decker appliances, but the program was
discontinued as far too costly.
   Analysts agree that no amount of marketing can solve the
industry's major woe: There are just too many convenience
stores -- about 83,000 in North America, according to
Convenience Store News. Also, sales of the stores' major
products -- cigarettes and beer -- aren't exactly booming
themselves. The analysts believe that the future of the
business lies with such oil-company giants as Los
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., which can market its
own gasoline less expensively, thus attracting customers to
its AM-PM minimarkets.
   For years, convenience stores have unsuccessfully tried to
solve their problems by expanding beyond their traditional
customer base -- blue-collar men between the ages of 18 and
35 -- to include more white-collar workers and women.
   In the mid-1980s, most chains introduced videocassette
sales and even rentals; the effort largely flopped because of
competition from an expanding number of videocassette stores
carrying a much wider selection of films. Some chains have
introduced automatic bank tellers, as well as freshly
prepared and microwave foods. Recently, Houston-based
National Convenience tried to go more upscale at some of its
stores, introducing such traditional yuppie fare as bottled
water, wine, Pepperidge Farm pastry products, and health
foods.
   At Circle K, expansion started in 1983, when the company
was a regional chain with 1,300 stores. By last year,
competition and management lapses had produced losses, and
the then-chairman, Karl Eller, decided that one solution was
to boost store prices by about 6% to 7%.
   "They felt the consumer wouldn't be sensitive to price
increases. They were wrong," says Debra J. Levin, a retail
analyst with Salomon Brothers. In the four months prior to
last February, sales nosedived 8% to 10% in the stores;
gasoline sales declined between 1% and 6%, Ms. Levin says.
Mr. Telzrow estimates that Circle K's merchandise sold for
about 5% more than the competition. In February, Mr. Eller
reversed the price rises and worked to pressure vendors to
reduce prices to the company's stores. But the move came too
late, and Mr. Eller resigned under criticism last month.
   Mr. Dearth says current price cuts, which he believes
bring Circle K in line with its competitors, have already
gone into effect with its biggest sellers: tobacco, candy,
beer, wine and bottled beverages.
   Future product offerings will be more tailored to the
particular ethnic or socioeconomic store clientele, a change
that will come hand in hand with a shift in power to store
managers. "Before, if it wasn't in the order book, you
couldn't order it. That was the simple rule," says Mr.
Dearth. He adds, "We are taking the handcuffs off the store
managers." Mr. Dearth says stores that have implemented
pricing and other changes have seen sales double over the
past eight weeks.
   In July and August, 3,900 Circle K stores will distribute
180 million scratch-and-win card games with more than $100
million in prizes, from free airline travel to discounted
gasoline purchases. In June, another 700 stores will begin a
frequent-purchaser program.
