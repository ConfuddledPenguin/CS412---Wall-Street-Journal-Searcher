   Mountainville, N.Y. -- Michael Chuney, a teacher at
Newburgh's North Junior High School, hoisted his video camera
on his shoulder and ambled over to the 23-foot pinwheel that
stood on a patch of raw dirt overlooking Schunemunk Mountain.
Mr. Chuney aimed his camera at the wheel and the two men
perched on top of a noisy forklift maneuvering a set of
bright metal rays into position. Then he focused on the woman
in a pink T-shirt and paint-spattered purple cords standing
nearby.
   "That's a really nice piece of art," he said, as sculptor
Alice Aycock dragged on a Marlboro Light. "It's a metaphor
for what -- the world?"

   Mr. Chuney hadn't seen anything yet. "Fantasy Sculpture
I," the latest attraction at Storm King Art Center, a
400-acre Hudson Valley sculpture park here in the mid-Hudson
Valley about 60 miles north of New York City, still didn't
have its "constellation" wheel dotted with zodiac-configured
holes. And work had yet to begin on its three-tiered "house"
boasting 12 copper gables, eight fortune-telling spheres,
four miniature bridges, two weeping white birch trees and a
tidy picket fence.
   By the time "Complex Visions: Sculpture and Drawings by
Alice Aycock" opens Monday for a long summer stay that will
last until Halloween, the best part of the show may already
be over. For the past two weeks, the 44-year-old Ms. Aycock,
whose eccentric constructions evoke everything from ancient
mazes and tombs to Cuisinarts and Magic 8-Balls, turned this
manicured, mostly outdoor museum into her
studio-away-from-home. Camping out on sleeping bags in an art
center guest house and consuming impressive quantities of
coffee, deli sandwiches and sunscreen, the sculptor and her
five-member team set to work on the patio.
   Although a number of indoor sculptures and works on paper
will be featured in this biggest-ever exhibition of her work,
Ms. Aycock's extravagant visions have maximum elbow room in
her larger outdoor works, which the art center's rolling
acres of lawn, pasture and woodland showcase to great effect.
Along with "Fantasy Sculpture," a new work created especially
for the exhibition, the show includes "The Machine that Makes
the World," a 1979 boatlike oblong of wooden mazes and
guillotinelike steel gates, and "Low Building with Dirt Roof
(For Mary)," a field-stone shack that measures just 30 inches
at its highest point.
   "There is on my part an attempt to create these fantastic
spaces that don't exist in the world per se, or to suggest
those spaces," Ms. Aycock explained.
   Recreating those fantasies at Storm King wasn't easy.
Boxed and bubble-wrapped sculptures were unpacked to reveal
joints that had popped after years of storage, while new
pieces didn't fit together as planned. Some things had been
left behind in the studio; others didn't make it at all.
Manhattan thieves helped themselves to glass panels from "The
Universal Stirrer," as the disassembled 1984 work sat on the
back of a moving van bound for Storm King. Designs for new
panels had to be hastily drafted and rushed to a Brooklyn
glass factory.
   Apart from "Threefold Manifestation II," a steel sculpture
that has sat placidly in one of Storm King's fields since it
was donated to the museum in 1987, most of the works featured
here had to be put together on the spot -- or built from the
ground up. Ms. Aycock first created "Low Building" on a
Pennsylvania farm field in 1973 as a tomblike memorial for a
niece who died at the age of 12. The original work may no
longer exist. It was sold along with the farm land it
occupied to International Business Machines Corp. in 1979. A
company spokesman said there is no record of the sculpture on
the property.
   So Ms. Aycock worked from the original plans and
photographs, bringing in stone from a quarry near Storm King
and tons of bagged topsoil to pour on the slanted roof.
Although the sculptor was all for recreating the work in one
of Storm King's pastures, that plan was nixed by the museum's
director, David Collens, who argued that few people would
visit "Low Building" if they had to hike there. So the
sculpture now sits on a neat and very public patch of grass
just off Storm King's patio, a far cry from the lonely
alfalfa field of its debut.
   To bring the work more into harmony with its lawn-lined
environment, Ms. Aycock decided to plant the topsoil roof
with the same grass seed that covers the lawn. And a small
opening has been left in one of the field-stone walls with a
view of the distant mountains, bringing the visitor closer to
a less-cultivated landscape.
   With its tons of dirt and roughly mortared walls, "Low
Building" still strikes a strange note in the midst of Storm
King's tony "green galleries," which showcase 110 works by
sculptors such as Alexander Calder, David Smith and Isamu
Noguchi.
   And then there is Storm King's greatest work of art, the
grounds themselves, which owe their gently sculpted curves
not to nature, but ingenious landscapers. As Ms. Aycock
assembled her "Fantasy Sculpture," bulldozers in the valley
below were plowing earth into a flat terrace for another
showplace for works from the center's permanent collection.
Mr. Collens, who may be the only museum director in New York
state to wear a walky-talky to work, regularly tours the
grounds by foot and by Jeep to "site" sculptures, which are
occasionally plucked by forklift from established settings
and transferred to more appropriate hills and dales. As for
the grass, a four-member crew makes sure that the lawns stay
at their regulation twoinch height (three in the winter) and
that the pastures maintain a rustic-but-tidy look.
   Ms. Aycock's "Fantasy Sculpture I," which contains
allusions to 18th-century stage sets (the rough wooden slats
at the base), Eastern images of heaven (the 12-sided copper
roof), 15th-century palindromes (elliptical phrases such as
"to cause cataclysms" printed under the eaves), and Magic
8-Balls (large white spheres implanted with spinners reading
"yes," "no," "maybe" and "ask again"), is a response to this
planned greenery.
   "I wanted to add myself to this sense of the garden -- not
in a wild, rambling way, but to the garden that this is," she
said as one of the art center's three lawn mowers cut neat
swaths of grass under a nearby Calder stabile. "It's
emblematic -- a temple to the sky or the sun, or a garden
folly . . . or a teahouse in an 18th-century garden."
   At some points during its installation, "Fantasy
Sculpture" seemed more of a folly than perhaps the sculptor
had intended. Although Ms. Aycock had decided to simplify
matters by eliminating the "hanging doors" that would have
made the structure seem to float over the ground, there were
still some annoying setbacks. After spending half a day
painstakingly attaching the steel-tipped rays, the crew
realized each panel was 1/16 of an inch too wide, and all had
to be taken down again. The names of punched-out
constellations (and mixed-up versions, formed by a
marble-toss game) had been stenciled a fraction too high to
show through the pinwheel's open window. And then the pear
tree that had been chosen to top off the work suddenly looked
too tall and scrawny, requiring a trip to the nursery to
select two suitably pliant and leafy birches.
   However, when the last rock and trailing branch had been
put in place, "Fantasy Sculpture I" was every bit the
spectacle Ms. Aycock intended, with darts of sunlight
streaming through the constellation cut-outs and glinting off
the copper roof. But even as Mr. Collens and a
relievedlooking Peter Stern, Storm King's president,
congratulated her, Ms. Aycock was already thinking of other
last-minute details. No one knew it yet, but plans were under
way to bring a live pigeon for "How to Catch and Manufacture
Ghosts," a 1979 indoor assemblage of pulleys, platforms,
water and a homemade battery. And soap bubbles, of course.
   "Someone will have to sit there and blow bubbles," she
said. "I definitely think it has to be operated in that way."
