   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it has agreed with
TCI Sports Inc. and Scripps Howard Productions Inc. to create
SportSouth Network, a regional sports cable network for the
Southeast.
   As an affiliate of Prime Network, a national
sports-program service, SportSouth Network will begin serving
Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina and
parts of North Carolina on Aug. 29, Turner said. The
cable-television programming concern said the new network
will broadcast at least eight hours of programming a day on
weekdays and 12 hours a day on weekends.
