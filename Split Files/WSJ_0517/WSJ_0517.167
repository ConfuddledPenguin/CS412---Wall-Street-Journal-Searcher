   Ohio Edison Co. said in Akron that its revenue would
increase 4.7% this year, 4.4% in 1991 and 2.7% in 1992 if the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approves a recommended
rate boost.
   However, the electric utility said the three-step increase
would become null and void if the commission doesn't grant an
increase in revenue of at least $198.5 million.

   The rate rise recommended by the commission's staff is
part of a "conditional stipulation" that the commission is
considering for adoption. Ohio Edison said formal hearings on
the rate boost have ended and a decision is expected by
midsummer.
   Ohio Edison had requested a $218 million increase in
revenue in August 1989. That request included a two-step
increase in revenue of 7.5% this year and a 5.3% increase in
1991.
