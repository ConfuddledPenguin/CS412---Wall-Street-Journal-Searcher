   TRENTON, N.J. -- The New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection said it ordered PPG Industries Inc.
to pay more than $31.5 million to clean up 32 residential
lots in Jersey City.
   The state agency said it believes PPG, based in
Pittsburgh, is responsible for chromium contamination at the
lots.

   A spokesman at the maker of glass, chemical and coatings
said, "We haven't seen the directive, so we can't comment."
   The state agency said it plans to begin cleanup work at
the sites this fall. If the company fails to reimburse the
state for the cost of the cleanup, PPG will be liable for
triple damages, Commissioner Judith Yaskin said in a release.
   PPG, according to the agency, operated a chromium chemical
plant in Jersey City for more than 50 years until it was
closed in 1964. However, chromium waste from the plant was
used as fill material at many locations in Jersey City,
including the residential lots slated for cleanup, the state
agency said.
