   Reading &amp; Bates Corp. said in Houston that it concluded an
agreement that will significantly reduce its long-term
obligations, but that a heavy debt load and other problems
may still result in the company's seeking Chapter 11 federal
Bankruptcy Code protection.
   The energy concern, which completed an extensive
restructuring last year, said its cash flow forecasts
indicate it may have trouble meeting loan obligations due
later this year.

   Reading &amp; Bates said it used one such loan to help finance
an agreement with Dow Chemical Co. under which it gave Dow
cash, property and a 3.4% equity stake in exchange for relief
from certain financial obligations related to a drilling rig
it jointly owned with Dow. Reading &amp; Bates will continue to
provide management and operating services for the rig.
   The company said it is talking with certain lenders about
a possible recapitalization.
