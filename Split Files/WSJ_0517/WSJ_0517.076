   GRAFTON GROUP Ltd. said in Toronto that it didn't declare
a quarterly dividend on its common or Class A shares because
of recent poor earnings and a depressed outlook for its
retail businesses. Grafton paid two Canadian cents (1.7 U.S.
cents) on each class of stock in March. It lowered the
quarterly dividend last June from eight Canadian cents.
Grafton is a retailer of apparel and footwear, which recently
announced plans to sell or close chains that sell womenswear,
discount merchandise and unisex casual wear and a
home-furnishing subsidiary. The company reported a loss of
24.5 million Canadian dollars (US$20.8 million), or C$1.38 a
share, for the year ended Jan. 31. Results included a loss of
C$29.1 million, or C$1.56 a share, from the units that it
plans to discontinue. In trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, Grafton Class A shares closed yesterday at C$4.60,
up 10 Canadian cents. The closely held common shares, which
last closed at C$4.50, didn't trade.
