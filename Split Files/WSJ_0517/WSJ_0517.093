   SAN DIEGO -- Smith Laboratories Inc. said that following
shareholder approval it completed its merger with Columbia
Hospital Corp., a closely held acute-care hospital concern
controlled by former Bass family financial adviser Richard
Rainwater and Richard Scott, Columbia's chairman.
   The combination of Smith, a San Diego-based maker of
medical equipment, and Columbia Hospital involves a tax-free
swap of shares of Smith Laboratories, Columbia Hospital, and
seven Columbia Hospital affiliates, for shares of Columbia
Hospital Corp., a new firm.
