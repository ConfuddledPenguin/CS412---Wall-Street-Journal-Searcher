   It's becoming very familiar. Retirees who believed they
enjoyed lifetime health benefits watch as their former
employers cut or eliminate them. Any legal fight pits the
retirees against their old bosses.
   But in a pending class-action suit against Primerica
Corp., retirees have an unusual ally: the management that
says it made those lifetime promises.

   A year ago, when Primerica raised salaried retirees'
health-insurance fees -- and warned that the benefit plan
might be axed altogether -- the decision was made by new
executives, most of whom didn't know their counterparts at
the old American Can Co., which became Primerica in 1987.
Now, old management is leading the fight against new.
   "We believe the new officers have zero sense of
responsibility to these people they didn't even know," says
Judd Alexander, a former executive vice president and member
of the annuity board that supervised benefits. Primerica
officials won't comment, but an outside lawyer for the
company says it was legally entitled to raise health fees and
needed to do so to cut costs.
   The Primerica suit and similar cases pending against
General Motors Corp. and Combustion Engineering Inc., now
part of Asea Brown Boveri AB, represent a new wave of suits
challenging the retrenchment by many companies in what they
think they owe retirees. These cases "will stake out the
legal boundaries under which these cuts can take place," says
Christopher Mackaronis, a former lawyer for the American
Association of Retired Persons and now part of the team suing
GM. The stakes are high: The suit against Primerica could
involve more than 2,500 retirees; those against Combustion
Engineering and GM, 1,500 and 84,000, respectively.
   Cuts in retirees' benefits are an increasingly common
response to rising costs. For retirees not eligible for
Medicare, companies' health-insurance bills jumped 18% in
1987 from a year earlier, says the Washington Business Group
on Health, an employers' group. Corporate attention is also
riveted by a new accounting rule, expected to take effect in
1992, that would force companies to put unfunded retiree
health costs on the balance sheet. In a survey last year of
the group's Fortune 500 members, 69% said they have asked
Medicare retirees to pay more, or plan to do so within two
years.
   In many such companies, especially those that have changed
hands, "institutional memory" of promises made has faded,
says Mr. Mackaronis. But at Primerica, institutional memory
is stepping forward.
   Most of the company's former officers have few financial
worries of their own. For himself, says Sal Guidice, former
executive vice president of administration, "I'd say `to hell
with them' and just pay" the higher fees.
   Instead, the erstwhile executives, including Mr. Guidice
and former chief executive Bill May, have declared war.
They've hired lawyers and collected thousands of dollars from
former colleagues to finance the fight, now being staged in
federal district court in Newark, N.J. The battle, they
contend, is over not just insurance premiums, but also
traditional company values. "I'm not in it for the money,"
says Mr. Alexander. "I'm in it for the people I worked with
long ago."
   When Mr. May and his colleagues ran American Can, generous
benefits and a comfortable retirement were vital parts of the
apparent security of working for the company. Asked to
describe her former employer, Irene Meijer, 71 years old, who
worked in the Green Bay, Wis., plant, says: "Well, it was
big. Goodness, it was all over the world." Did she ever
imagine a change in her benefits? "Nobody thought anything
like that could happen."
   That was by design, the former officers say. They say
American Can relied on lucrative benefits rather than high
pay to recruit and keep people -- and, later, to induce some
to retire early. Over the years, some changes were made.
Once, for example, the monthly health-coverage fee was raised
to $5 a person from $3.66, but Mr. Alexander says major
improvements in coverage "offset" that increase.
   The former officers say a reserve clause in plan
descriptions, which refers to "modifications . . . in
conformity with applicable legislation," limits changes to
those required by amendments in federal Medicare or benefits
laws. Even that proviso didn't appear in many company
documents, including those given employees when they retired,
says Mr. Alexander.
   "The way I read it, I didn't have the flexibility
{management is} now exercising," says Mr. May, the former
chief executive. "That flexibility never existed."
   Shortly before he retired in 1985, Mr. Giudice recalls, he
counseled the widow of a colleague who had just died. He says
he never questioned that her benefits would be preserved.
   Still, by 1985 American Can already was changing. Former
Wall Street whiz Gerald Tsai Jr., who later became chairman
of the company and changed its name, was moving it from
industry into finance. In 1988, Sanford I. Weill, who had
built Shearson Loeb Rhoades, merged Primerica into his
Commercial Credit Group Inc. and quickly set out to cut
costs.
   In January 1989, retirees got a letter that began
innocuously with news of the merger: "We are now entering an
exciting chapter in our redirection." Two paragraphs later
came the blockbuster: a boost in retiree insurance fees to
$50 a month per person covered from $5. And, said the letter,
"We must reserve the right to change and/or terminate this
plan at any time."
   For Mr. May, that statement was especially serious.
"Anybody who increases {the fee} 1,000% in one year," he
believes, isn't going to stop there. Former employees, adds
Mr. Guidice, are "looking to me and others who were around
and helped guide" policies. Failing to help them, he
contends, would be like "breaking a moral commitment."
   The outside attorney for Primerica scoffs at the former
executives' position. "If {they} say, `Gee, that's not what
we meant,' that rings hollow," says the lawyer, who asks not
to be named. "It says, when you're in management . . . you
want total flexibility. . . . `Now that I'm a beneficiary,
{it's} take care of me.'"
   More likely, the company's attorney suggests, the former
management just hadn't looked closely enough for cost
savings. "It's easy not to look at these things," he says.
With new management, "sometimes, you look." A rate of $5 a
month, he says, isn't in line with health-care costs -- or
shareholder interests.
   Mr. May, now on the board of Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York, says he's aware of economic realities and
that the health-care system is "a shambles." But he says
Primerica is putting the burden on the wrong people: "You're
asking them to ameliorate a situation that is not their
responsibility and for which they don't have an answer."
   Legal victory won't hinge, though, on who should carry
that burden, but on whether the company can legitimately
raise the fee. Primerica's attorney says the reserve clause
used in company documents allows more leeway than the former
officers say. "I can tell you that before {Primerica made the
change}, it took a long, hard, careful look" at the law, the
lawyer says.
   Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati struck a
big blow for employers with a 1988 ruling in Musto vs.
American General Corp. The court essentially found that while
American General orally had promised retirees that their
benefits would remain intact -- and company brochures might
have given that impression -- the small print in the plan
documents said otherwise, and that's what counted. The
Supreme Court refused to review the case.
   Even under current law, however, plaintiffs' lawyers say
there is plenty of room left for argument. They say the
courts must evaluate how comprehensive a reserve clause is,
whether employees have access to that language and who makes
the promises. In Musto, it was supervisors, says Mr.
Mackaronis, the lawyer in the GM suit. "It's another thing to
have people who devised the plan step forward and say, `This
wasn't the deal.'" That could be "a defense attorney's
nightmare."
   The former Primerica employees hope for just that. "The
people we're suing don't have any of the background we do,"
says Mr. Alexander.
   Whatever the court rules on Primerica, passions will
continue to flare. Igor I. Sikorsky Jr., the attorney
representing Combustion Engineering retirees in their suit,
says he and other lawyers "are constantly turning away
{retirees} who have no legal recourse," given the design of
some company plans and the law. In a letter last week to Sen.
Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), he urged Congress to amend the
laws to better protect older workers' and retirees' benefits.
   It's a "generational issue," says Robert Levin at the
Washington Business Group. Current retirees, he says, should
make some sacrifices so that companies can provide more for
employees and prospective retirees.
   Still, says Mr. Levin, the Business Group survey showed
that 73% of its members were "much more comfortable" changing
benefits for future rather than current retirees. It's hard
to predict which companies will cut back. "Part of it, " he
says, "is cultural."

        The Benefits -- and Costs -- of Retirement
                                                                                                       

   In a study of medium and large employers, March 1990:
                                                                                                       

   -- 84% said they provide medical coverage to retired
employees both before and after age 65. Almost 16% said
retirees either aren't covered or are covered only before age
65.
                                                                                                       

   In preliminary results from a new study of a similar but
smaller, sampling of employers, May 1990:
                                                                                                       

   -- 53% said they have reduced medical benefits for current
retirees at least once in the last two years, primarily by
requiring a bigger contribution, deductible or co-insurance.
   -- 63% said they will probably make a similar decrease in
the next two years.
