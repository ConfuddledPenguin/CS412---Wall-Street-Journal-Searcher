   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices recovered from early
declines to end slightly higher on a worsening of the
Peruvian mine labor situation.
   The most-active July delivery ended with a gain of 0.30
cent a pound at $1.1440, after trading as much as one cent a
pound lower at $1.1310.

   Late yesterday, well after the close of trading, the
world's leading copper producer -- Chile's state-owned copper
company, Codelco -- further reduced its production forecast
for this year to 1.19 million tons of refined copper. This
projection is down from its original estimate of 1.29 million
tons at the end of 1989. Since then, there have been several
cuts in Codelco's estimated output for this year. The company
said numerous production problems have reduced output and
increased costs.
   For most of the session yesterday, futures prices
continued under the recent pressure generated by an
improvement of copper supplies and an apparent slowdown in
the U.S. economy, which may result in slower copper
consumption.
   Although the soon-to-expire May delivery, which closed at
$1.2170 for a gain of 0.40 cent, showed an 0.10 cent
improvement in its premium over July, the premium of the cash
price over the three-months' contract in London continued to
narrow.
   "The severe tightness of supplies has apparently been
broken, and the only thing that kept prices from sliding
significantly was the report that a miners' strike would take
place Monday in Peru," said one analyst.
   The New York spokesman for Southern Peru Copper Corp. said
the unions representing workers at the company's Toquepala
and Cuajone mines, and its Ilo smelter, had given notice they
will strike on Monday.
   The employees at Southern Peru Copper's three
installations on March 12 went on a strike that lasted eight
weeks. They returned to work late last week without an
agreement in response to a government order. Negotiations
between the unions and management have continued since then.
   The company's Ilo smelter, which receives concentrates
from other mines as well as its own two, has an annual
production of about 280,000 tons of refined copper.
   Separately, the Peruvian state-owned mining company,
Centromin, is also on strike. The company principally mines
zinc, lead and silver, but it produces about 35,000 tons of
copper.
   Economic statistics continue to present a
less-than-promising picture for copper. The Commerce
Department said housing starts in April fell 5.8%, following
a drop of 11.2% in March. Permits for housing starts, a
longer-term indicator, were off 8.7% in April following a 5%
decline in March.
   This was the third consecutive monthly drop in these
statistics, which, according to one analyst, "represents a
solid trend." Combined with other recent statistics that
indicate a slowing of economic growth, they are a negative
factor for copper, he said.
   Another analyst, Fred Demler, metals economist for
PaineWebber, New York, noted that there are actually mixed
signals about the economy, and that could be eventually
favorable for copper.
   "While the economy may be slowing, interest rates have
been dropping and the stock market is strong," he said. "This
indicates that down the road the economy will improve."
   An important factor that soon could make its presence
felt, Mr. Demler said, was that three U.S. copper-producing
companies, which have a combined production capacity of
420,000 tons of refined copper, will have their labor
agreements with unions end on June 30.

   ENERGY: The American Petroleum Institute's bullish
statistics this week on U.S. gasoline inventories didn't
counter the API's extremely bearish figures on crude oil
stocks in energy futures trading yesterday. The result: a
56-cents-a-barrel plunge in the price of the New York
Mercantile Exchange's June crude oil contract. The API
numbers, released late Tuesday after trading had ended,
showed a huge 4.2-million-barrel decline in gasoline
inventories for the week ended last Friday. But crude oil
inventories rose by more than 4.3 million barrels. Some
traders had expressed hopes that the gasoline number would
prove more bullish than the crude figure was bearish, but
those hopes didn't pan out. The June crude oil contract ended
the session at $19.03 a barrel, just above the
psychologically important $19 level. June gasoline, which
started the trading day higher and then sagged with crude,
rebounded at the end of the day to finish 0.66 cents higher.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures closed up the
two-cent-a-pound daily limit in response to a weekly report
indicating a tightening of supplies, contrary to analysts'
expectations. The report showed a net flow of 199,000 pounds
of pork bellies out of warehouses to processors. Many
analysts had estimated net movement into warehouses, in
advance of an expected seasonal peak in demand this summer,
of as much as one million to 1.5 million pounds, said Jerry
Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.
The warehouse report augurs well for higher belly futures
prices in the weeks ahead, said Charles Levitt, a futures
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in Chicago. One reason
for the decline of pork belly movement into warehouses is
that many pork bellies are apparently being ground up into
trimmings to be used for hot dogs and sausage, where retail
demand is higher currently than it is for bacon, Mr. Levitt
said. The belly futures market was also poised for a rebound
following a week of declining prices, analysts said. Pork
bellies for July delivery closed up two cents, at 64.37 cents
a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rally in pork
belly futures prices spilled over into the live hog pit at
the Merc, where July live hog futures closed up 1.5 cents at
63.67 cents a pound.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices rose on continued turmoil in the
Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer. The July
contract ended with a gain of $35 a metric ton to $1,433,
after trading as high as $1,485. Signs of division among the
armed forces of the Ivory Coast resulted in renewed tension
that sparked the price surge in futures, said Sandra Kaul,
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. Apparently, army recruits
protesting low pay and poor living conditions commandeered
both military and civilian vehicles and rioted in the
streets, she said. Regular troops were stationed to guard
communication centers, she noted, and added that the airport,
which early yesterday was held by the recruits, later was
taken over by military police. A French military force
stationed outside Abidjan, the nation's capital, was put on
maximum alert, she said. Another analyst, Judith Ganes, of
Merrill Lynch, observed that, so far, the disturbances
haven't affected the production or shipments of cocoa.
"However, there is the concern that if they last long enough
and spread, they will have an impact on the cocoa market,"
she said.
