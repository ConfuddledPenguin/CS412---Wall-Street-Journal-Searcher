   Veba AG, a West German energy and chemical concern, said
in an interim report that first-quarter profit climbed 5.3%

   Pretax profit climbed 6.3% to 605 million marks from 569
million marks.
   The company said higher volume and prices in its mineral
oil division led to a "considerable" increase in that area.
Oil sales climbed 9.2% to 2.53 billion marks from 2.32
billion marks a year earlier; chemical sales jumped 16% to
2.62 million marks from 2.27 million marks; and electricity
sales increased 4.5% to 2.89 billion marks from 2.76 billion
marks.
   Veba said earnings in its electricity, trading,
transportation and services divisions rose slightly from a
year earlier, but weren't able to equal "the high
year-earlier level" in its oil and chemical division. It
didn't break down first-quarter earnings by division.
