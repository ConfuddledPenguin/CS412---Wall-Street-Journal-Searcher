   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission named
James Doty as general counsel, one of the agency's most
important slots.
   Mr. Doty will succeed Daniel Goelzer, who recently
announced plans to leave the SEC later this month after 16
years at the agency. Mr. Goelzer, who was general counsel for
seven years, will join the Washington office of the law firm
Baker &amp; McKenzie.

   Mr. Doty, 50 years old and a friend of Chairman Richard
Breeden, recently joined the SEC as counselor to the
chairman. Before joining the SEC, he was a partner in the
Washington office of the law firm Baker &amp; Botts, where he
specialized in securities law. Mr. Doty is a graduate of Rice
University and Yale Law School.
   The general counsel is the SEC's chief legal officer,
representing the commission in litigation at the appellate
level and higher. The counsel is also the agency staffer
charged with interpreting federal securities laws.
