   The director Roger Donaldson has come to specialize in
making successful movies without any discernible logic. "No
Way Out" didn't make any sense at all but had a razzle-dazzle
speed and style that made you think it did. "Cocktail," on
the other hand, didn't have much of anything except Tom
Cruise, which was enough to make it a hit and to inflate Mr.
Donaldson's currency in Hollywood.
   Now, with "Cadillac Man," he's brought his swooping camera
and chaotic sense of storytelling to the world of the car
salesman. The main thing he's accomplished with this film is
to make Robin Williams seem dull.

   Mr. Williams is Joey O'Brien, a relentless huckster and
womanizer whose sales have gotten worse as his romances have
gotten better, or at least more numerous. None of it's really
working out for Joey, who's losing his grip on his customers
and his girlfriends. He's brash and crude, but smart enough
to recognize his failings. One could imagine Mr. Williams
doing something wild, something unexpected with Joey's manic
drive for conquests at work and in bed. In fact, he does do
the really unexpected: He plays Joey straight, the way Ken
Friedman, the script writer must have created him. He's
sleazy, as he should be, and boring, as he shouldn't.
   The picture demonstrates how a little of everything can
add up to a lot of nothing. The film makers have tossed in a
little "Something Wild," a little "Tin Men," a little
"Married to the Mob," even a little "Dog Day Afternoon." But
while they recognize the appeal of an off-center sensibility,
they've fallen in with the evil twin of unconventional
plotting, which is incoherent plotting.
   "Cadillac Man" is populated by eccentric characters, many
of whom dress in bizarre clothing. Here, though, the
eccentricities fit like bad wigs; they make you stare at the
person wearing them but for the wrong reason. What is the
purpose of Lila, Joey's dimwitted "fashion designer"
girlfriend, besides giving the lithe, young actress Lori
Petty the chance to prance around nearly naked wearing funny
hats and earrings? Why does a man named Joey O'Brien have an
Italian mother who sounds like a Jewish mother?
   The clunky rhythms are as persistently wrong and
irritating as the man who insists on tapping his feet at a
concert -- and a half-beat off at that. Much of the problem
lies in the script, which has Joey explain his character to
the camera -- in prosaic language that seems especially flat
because we've become accustomed to hearing something bright
and wild when Robin Williams talks directly to an audience.
   Even scenes that might have sounded amusing on paper don't
survive the transition to film. The opening, for example:
Joey pulls up alongside a funeral procession that's stopped
because the hearse has broken down. The astute salesman sees
a smoking car and smells a sale. So he pulls over, offers his
condolences and hands his business card to the funeral
director -- and then to the widow.
   The director might have suspected Joey's character was
coming off a little flat, which may have been the purpose of
the bits of narrative that allow Joey to tell the audience
what he's thinking. But what he's thinking is so
uninteresting: "Hmmm, the paint job is still holding up," he
muses, staring at the outer walls of the house when he goes
to visit his ex-wife.
   Most dispiriting are the scenes between Joey and his ex,
which are full of those deadly moments when a person's deep
feelings about parenthood are supposed to compensate for all
his other character defects. The dialogue is even more
mundane than the thought behind it:
   Asking about his teen-age daughter, Joey says: "She into
drugs or something like that?"
   "She needs a father," says his ex-wife, played worried by
Pamela Reed.
   "She has a father," says Joey.
   The movie drags itself through the opening sequences
designed to establish Joey's troubles. The car dealership he
works at seems to be a friendly kind of place; the guys
gather around for chummy lunches at a Chinese restaurant, the
way the salesmen met at a diner in "Tin Men." Only here, the
waitress has better lines than the salesmen do, which would
be fine except that the movie isn't about her. The old gang
will be breaking up because the owner is moving the operation
to a better neighborhood. Only one or two salesmen will be
brought along, so Joey has one day to prove that he deserves
to stay on staff.
   Meanwhile, his women are becoming more demanding by the
minute. Yet Joey's problems are dwarfed by the dramatic
entrance of Tim Robbins, who plays Larry, the cuckolded
husband of the car dealership's secretary. He storms Turgeon
Luxury Auto Sales with a machine gun and holds everyone
hostage. This event allows Joey to become a man, to dump his
extraneous girlfriends and to keep his job.
   There is one minor note of pleasure, in the nasal whine of
Fran Drescher, who plays Joey's married lover Joy. Ms.
Drescher is one of the more cheerfully obnoxious creatures to
march across the screen in recent memory -- and she brings
her nasty little dog Chester with her.

   VIDEO TIP: If you're in the mood for a witty picture about
a salesman, take a look at "Tin Men." The 1987 Barry Levinson
movie about fast-talking aluminum siding salesmen in the '50s
had great talk and good performances from Richard Dreyfuss
and Danny DeVito.
