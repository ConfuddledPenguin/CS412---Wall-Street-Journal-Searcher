   LOS ANGELES -- Accounting systems at a First Executive
Corp. insurance unit were so sloppy in the mid-80s that
regulators had trouble confirming the unit's billions of
dollars in insurance reserves, according to a report by the
New York state insurance department.
   The study of the struggling First Executive's New York
unit resulted in a recent fine and unearthed a welter of
problems said to have plagued the unit from at least 1983 to
1986, the official period of the examination. Of late, First
Executive has become the focus of intense scrutiny because of
its junk bond holdings and apparent concerns about its
financial health.

   Since the period of the examination, conditions seem to
have improved markedly at Executive Life Insurance Co. of New
York, according to Terence Lennon, assistant deputy
superintendent and chief examiner of the New York Insurance
Department.
   The New York department currently is auditing the company
for the three years ended Dec. 31, 1989, a study that won't
be finished for many months. But Mr. Lennon said he thinks
the results will be more straight-forward than the previous
examination. "Right now, the company is obviously under
stress, but the reserves you are looking at {in the company}
are real," he said. It often takes months or even years from
the time an audit is completed to the time it is released and
any action is taken.
   The recently filed report, however, said that during the
period of the examination Executive Life of New York had more
than $288 million of insurance policies lingering on the
books without appropriate reserves in so-called "suspense"
accounts, where new business awaited processing for months
and even years. The insurer also was found to have
inappropriately claimed $148 million of reinsurance and to
have boosted a variety of other detailed accounts by millions
of dollars.
   Last month, First Executive's New York unit admitted a
portion of the insurance law violations alleged in the study.
The violations involved reinsurance, bonuses to sales agents,
and impeding the examination itself. The company paid a
$25,000 fine, a small levy that, in part, took into account
the parent company's current plight, regulators said.
   Ronald L. Kehrli, president and chief executive officer of
Executive Life of New York, says the company's accounting
systems in mid-decade were strained by a surge in business.
"The systems we had in place, quite honestly, weren't able to
handle the volume." Mr. Kehrli said a torrent of about $800
million in new business came into the New York unit that
year. He said that less than $1 million remains in suspense
accounts awaiting processing.
   One industry analyst said that First Executive's unit may
have gotten off very lightly. "The examiners' criticisms were
so strong that the company is fortunate to have retained its
license to operate in New York," says Joseph M. Belth,
professor of insurance at the University of Indiana and
editor of the Insurance Forum, an industry publication. Mr.
Belth has voiced frequent criticism of First Executive.
   First Executive is confronting depressed values in its big
portfolio of high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds, as well as
concerns by policyholders about its financial health. It
operates through two principal units: California-based
Executive Life Insurance Co., with $12.39 billion in assets
at March 31, and Executive Life of New York, with assets of
$3.69 billion as of the same date.
   First Executive said earlier this week that it paid more
than $1.33 billion in the first quarter to holders who had
surrendered insurance policies and annuities. But it added
that surrender requests had slowed last month and this. The
company also reported first quarter net income of $45.4
million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $554.5 million,
compared with a loss in the year-ago period.
   But looking at the 1986 accounts, New York regulators
found much to question. So murky was the accounting that it
was impossible "to determine with any reasonable degree of
certainty, the total liability reported at year-end {in 1986}
on any given policy or contract issued by the company," the
report said.
   It wasn't the first time Executive Life of New York had
run afoul of regulators. The New York department in 1987
levied a $250,000 fine -- equal to its largest ever -- on the
First Executive unit for violating a variety of insurance
laws, notably sections covering reinsurance.
   Not long after the 1987 fine and in the midst of the
troubled 1986 examination, First Executive put its New York
unit on the block. However, an agreement to sell the unit to
closely held WW Acquisition Corp. for about $460 million fell
through in January.
   There were estimates when First Executive offered to sell
the New York unit that it might bring in $600 million or
more. But that figure proved optimistic, perhaps because of
some of the problems regulators encountered in the 1986
examination. Among other things, examiners reported that 46%
of the company's bonds and short-term investments were not
only junk bonds by regulatory definition, but "below average
quality" within that definition.
   The auditors' analysis was hampered by the company's
demand that all questions be submitted in writing. "Many
answers were incomplete and some were unresponsive," says the
report. Executive Life of New York's Mr. Kehrli says the
order for written queries was "intended to facilitate the
examination, not prevent it."
   Often the examination uncovered relatively small but
nagging discrepancies. At one point, auditors found credits
and debits for company agents' balances reported at a total
of $10.3 million -- or roughly double what they should have
been. The company wasn't able to explain the difference.
Another time, the value of bonds was found to be overstated
by several million dollars, representing a total of seven
accounting errors.
   In all, New York state auditors said $272 million should
have been swept from Executive Life of New York's surplus
account. If done, the cut would have put the company's
statutory "surplus" account in the red. But the department
cut the recommended reduction itself by $110 million, after
which the adjusted statutory surplus was a bare $23.3 million
for the 1986 year end. The final, adjusted net worth included
a $130 million infusion from First Executive's California
unit in February, 1987.
   In February, the California unit made another $50 million,
bringing the statutory surplus to $147.8 million.
