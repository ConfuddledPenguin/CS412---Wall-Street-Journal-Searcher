   NEW YORK -- Stocks closed mixed as investors took profits
in big stocks and searched for bargains in smaller issues.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.77 lower at
2819.68, snapping a fourday streak of gains. Declining New
York Stock Exchange issues outpaced advancers by 814 to 701,
and volume totaled 159,810,000 shares.

   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
dropped 0.28 to 354.00, and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index slipped 0.17 to 193.14. But the Nasdaq
composite index gained 0.43 to 442.93.
   Traders said institutional investors put in a busy day,
taking profits in technology shares and financial stocks, and
buying up some health and retail issues. Compaq Computer
slipped 3/8 to 114 1/8, while Digital Equipment eased 1 5/8
to 88 3/8. Humana gained 1 1/8 to 46 1/8.
   Bond and stock investors shrugged off the consumer price
report that showed an increase of 0.2% last month, slightly
below what economists expected. Now many are turning their
attention to tomorrow's expiration of May stock-index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks. The
expiration could be very active and possibly volatile,
traders said, because positions that were taken in last
Friday's big rally may be unwound this week.
   Meanwhile, investors are cautious, but discernibly
positive on the outlook for stocks. Michael L. Schonberg,
chief investment strategist at Chase Investors Management
Corp., thinks the market is in "a new bull leg." Mr.
Schonberg said he is fully invested, but he continues to
concentrate on growth stocks rather than seeking a broad
exposure. "The cyclical rebound in economic activity isn't
here yet," he said.
   James Awad, president at BMI Capital, a money management
company, said that he has been paring down cash levels from
about 40% in April to about 25% currently. Mr. Awad said
declining interest rates should refuel economic activity
providing a bottom for corporate profits in the second half
of the year. Additionally, he believes prices of a number of
secondary issues seem to have hit bottom and are turning
higher.
   Disappointment with Hewlett-Packard's financial
performance in its fiscal second quarter sent the stock
tumbling 1 7/8 to 46 1/8 in Big Board-composite trading of
1.8 million shares. The company's net income for the three
months ended in April dropped 8.4% from a year earlier and
fell short of most analysts' estimates.
   Several analysts said they would lower their fiscal 1990
earnings estimates on the company, citing concerns that
low-end products are accounting for an increasing percentage
of its sales, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Hewlett-Packard "can still live profitably and
successfully with low-end products, but they need to cut
operating costs much more in order to do so," said Timothy R.
McCallum, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
   Monsanto continued a decline that began Tuesday after
Goldman Sachs lowered the stock's investment rating and First
Boston reiterated a sell recommendation on the stock. After
losing 5 points in Big Board trading Tuesday, the stock
dropped 2 1/2 to 101 1/4.
   Goldman cited soft April sales for Lasso and Roundup, the
company's major agricultural chemicals, as a reason for its
downgrading of Monsanto. Meanwhile, First Boston noted that
Elan is close to obtaining approval from U.S. regulators for
a drug that would compete with Calan, the company's
calcium-channel blocker.
   Castle &amp; Cooke, which said it would delay the proposed
spinoff of its Dole Food unit to shareholders, skidded 4 to
32 1/8 on 1.3 million shares. The company's board decided
that acceptable financing for the real-estate development
business that would remain after the spinoff wouldn't be
available.
   Circle K plummeted 7/8 to 1 1/8 on 3.1 million shares in
response to its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection, submitted after the company failed in an effort
to get creditors to agree to a restructuring of its $1.1
billion in junk-bond debt.
   Alcan Aluminium topped the Big Board's list of most active
issues for the second consecutive session as a result of huge
institutional trades designed to capture its quarterly
dividend. The stock, which went down 1/4 to 21 1/4 on nearly
9.2 million shares, carries a 5.2% dividend yield; the record
date for its next payout is tomorrow.
   Syntex gained 1 3/8 to 55 1/8 after Merrill Lynch selected
the issue as its "focus stock of the week." Analyst Richard
Vietor said Syntex is worth $60 a share based on fundamentals
and is "the most undervalued of the drug stocks," according
to the investor report.
   Sotheby's Holdings climbed 1 1/4 to 18 5/8 in the wake of
an auction of impressionist and post-impressionist works at
Christie's Tuesday night, at which "Portrait of Dr. Gachet"
by Vincent van Gogh was sold for a record $82.5 million.
   Glaxo Holdings slid 5/8 to 26 7/8 after Sweden's Astra AB
reported that its ulcer drug Losec, which competes with
Glaxo's drug Zantac, has been gaining acceptance in European
markets since its introduction late last year.
   Manville fell 1/2 to 6 1/2 after U.S. and New York state
judges ordered the trust that the company established to pay
the claims of asbestos victims to account for a shortage in
funds. The judges also raised the possibility that they may
order drastic measures to ensure that the trust and Manville
make payments more rapidly.
   Perkin-Elmer advanced 7/8 to 22. The company agreed to
sell a majority stake in its optical-lithography operations
to a group that includes Silicon Valley Group and
International Business Machines.
   Ohio Edison, which reached a conditional agreement in its
pending rate case before Ohio regulators, gained 1/2 to 20
1/8. The company said the proposed three-year accord would
allow its revenue to rise 4.65% this year, 4.35% in 1991 and
2.65% in 1992.
   Time Warner slid 1 5/8 to 94 1/4 after the New York City
Board of Estimate voted to issue a preliminary denial of the
company's application to renew its two cabletelevision
franchises in Manhattan.
   Baltimore Bancorp dropped 7/8 to 14. The company rejected
a $217 million takeover offer from First Maryland Bancorp, a
unit of Allied Irish Banks, and said it wasn't for sale.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.12
to 353.68. Amex volume totaled 12,187,230 shares, compared
with 14,512,035 shares Tuesday. There were 265 issues
advancing, 293 declining and 281 unchanged.
   Sbarro rose 1 1/2 to 28 1/4. The company reported that net
income for the first quarter ended April 22 was more than 40%
higher than in the comparable year-earlier period.
   Landmark Land gained 1/2 to 10 7/8. The company, which
agreed to sell a substantial portion of its real-estate
holdings, put itself up for sale and said it would consider
selling additional assets as well.
   AT&amp;E gained 1 1/2 to 19 1/2. Analysts attributed the
stock's strength to optimism about the prospects for the
company's Receptor message watch, which is currently being
tested in the Portland, Ore., area.
