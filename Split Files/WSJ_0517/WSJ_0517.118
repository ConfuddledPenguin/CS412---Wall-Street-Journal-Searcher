   American First Corp., an Oklahoma City-based manufacturing
company, said it didn't receive enough shareholder votes to
double its authorized shares to 20 million.
   Approval required 51% of the shares outstanding to vote in
favor of the measure, but only about 56% to 57% of the shares
were voted, and the proposal won only 45% of the shares
outstanding. Directors said they plan to resubmit the
proposal to holders after the company forms a capitalization
plan. American First has been trying to raise capital for its
Tricon American Corp. unit.

   American First also said that John W. Cox, formerly senior
vice president and treasurer, was named president and chief
executive officer, succeeding Gregory J. Edwards, who remains
chairman. Mr. Edwards said last month that he planned to
resign from day-to-day management activities.
