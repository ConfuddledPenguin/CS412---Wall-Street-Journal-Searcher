   More Counties Insist
   Not All Trash Is Equal

   THROWING OUT the trash is getting more complicated.
   Residents of Ingham County, Mich., which includes Lansing,
must call the county health department for an appointment to
bring in their household hazardous waste -- mostly paint cans
and pesticides. All appointments generally are scheduled for
one day each month, with as many as six every 15 minutes. For
material not in the original container, an identifying label
must be affixed, and each container must be placed in its own
clear plastic bag. For the service, participating households
had to pay an average of $75 to $80 last year.
   In Hennepin County, Minn., which includes Minneapolis, it
will be a misdemeanor to put old refrigerators and air
conditioners by the curb after July 1. Violators will face a
$300 fine. "Technically, you could also go to jail," says
county Commissioner Mark Andrew. To avoid the penalties, a
resident will have to call a vendor specially licensed by the
county, who will pick up an appliance within 24 hours for a
fee of $15. The vendor then will be responsible for removing
the appliance's chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which harm the
Earth's protective ozone layer, and polychlorinated biphenols
(PCBs), which cause cancer.
   Meanwhile, in Fitchburg, Wis., near Madison, residents
have been required since April 2 to recycle all polystyrene
plastic, such as egg cartons, supermarket meat trays and the
"clamshells" that enclose fast-food hamburgers. Residents
must wash the polystyrene, put it in a special recyclable
plastic bag supplied by the town and dispose of the bag in
the same curbside-pickup bin that's used for recyclable glass
and plastic containers. Fitchburg requires separate bins for
metal cans and paper products.
                                                                                                       

   Converting a Town
   To Energy Efficiency
                                                                                                       

   TO DEMONSTRATE the environmental and financial benefits of
energy efficiency, Iowa Public Service Co. plans to revamp an
entire town's electrical and natural-gas gear.
   The utility will turn the town of Rock Valley, Iowa, plus
200 commercial and 13 industrial energy users, into an
energy-efficiency laboratory during the five-year program
running through 1994. The company is responding to two
concerns shared by many other utilities: the possibility of
power shortages later in the decade and the more immediate
concern of clean air and other environmental legislation.
   Under the program, Rock Valley customers will get free
water-heater insulation blankets and discounted maintenance
on their appliances. Residents of the town, which has a
population of 2,700, also will be offered rebates,
zero-interest financing and other incentives to buy
energy-efficient appliances and equipment.
   Renewable energy sources also will be stressed, including
the use of electric motor vehicles. Commercial and industrial
customers will be trained to operate and maintain energy
equipment more efficiently.
   While the utility stresses it's not trying to win over
propane-fuel users as new customers, it says it wouldn't turn
them away.
                                                                                                       

   Day-Care Centers Stick
   With Disposables
                                                                                                       

   CLOTH DIAPERS may be environmentally applauded, but they
don't get endorsements across the board.
   The reservations coincide with a pronounced turning of the
tide in favor of cloth diapers. "We're running out of
landfill space," according to Florida state Sen. Tom
McPherson, whose bill would ban disposable diapers from being
sold in Florida after October 1993. A New Jersey bill,
meanwhile, would tax consumers a penny for every disposable
diaper that they purchase.
   But disposables are here to stay as far as Kinder-Care
Learning Centers Inc. is concerned. "Disposable diapers can
be dealt with more sanitarily," says Sallye Blake,
spokeswoman for the national child-care chain, who adds that
Kinder-Care requires disposable diapers except when a child
is allergic to them.
   Kinder-Care's position is supported by the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health
Association. The two organizations recently drafted a set of
proposed performance standards for out-of-home child-care
programs. While the draft document is 400 pages long, the
project's co-chairman, George Sterne, a New Orleans
physician, says most public comments have been about the
disposable vs. cloth debate.
   "Many people feel we're off-base" in recommending
disposable diapers, says Dr. Sterne. Although he's a cloth
advocate himself, Dr. Sterne believes there would be a public
health problem involving infectious diseases if cloth diapers
were worn by the roughly one-quarter of American children
between the ages of one and three who are in outside day-care
centers.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   IT'S BACK to the drawing board for Dustbuster. As
currently manufactured by Black &amp; Decker Corp., the hand-held
vacuum cleaner's rechargeable battery isn't removable. Since
B&amp;D is expecting a number of new recycling laws to require
that all household batteries be recyclable, a spokeswoman
says the company is working on a new Dustbuster that will
have a removable battery pack. . . . Annual revenue for the
waste-disposal industry will hit $50 billion by the
mid-1990s, double 1989's volume, predicts National Solid
Wastes Management Association, a trade group. . . . The Texas
town of Sour Lake is one of 20 communities whose new phone
directories are printed on recycled paper by Southwestern
Bell Telephone, a unit of Southwestern Bell Corp.
