   TORONTO -- Horsham Corp. said its partners in Clark Oil &amp;

   Paul Melnuk, Horsham's chief financial officer, said he
didn't know who bought the shares. He said Mr. Novelly and
Mr. Goldstein have sold about 3.5 million Horsham subordinate
voting shares in the last few months and currently hold about
5 million of the shares.
   Horsham is controlled by its chairman and chief executive,
Peter Munk, who holds all of the company's multiple voting
shares and about an 83% voting stake.
   Mr. Melnuk said Apex Oil, of St. Louis is on the verge of
coming out of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
"Presumabley {Mr. Novelly and Mr. Goldstein} just needed some
liquidity" to help finance Apex Oil's reorganization, Mr.
Melnuk said.
   Messrs. Novelly and Goldstein couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Horsham closed at $8.25, up 37.5 cents.
