   In this age of serial monogamy and
   Parallel polygamy
   And mutually consenting adult
   Menage a trigamy,
   I'd like to raise a gentle voice
   For those bygone days of plainer choice,
   Like a little simple bigamy.
   -- Peter Friedman.

   Budget Culture
                                                                                                       

   In the arts, my taste runs to cheap thrills,
   Of the kind critics long have deplored,
   Not for reasons of taste, but simply because
   They're all that I can afford.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   Time Study
                                                                                                       

   We heard it when we were young,
   Then say it at a later stage --
   And that is the case history
   Of "when I was your age . . ."
   -- Mimi Kay.
