   WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted 95-4 to provide $2.9
billion in emergency funds over five years to help strained
health-care systems shoulder the cost of the AIDS epidemic.
   The House is expected to pass a similar bill in several
weeks. The Bush administration hasn't endorsed the bill and
has expressed concern about the precedent of providing large
amounts of emergency help to benefit a group of people with
one disease. But the growing support for the bill will
probably eliminate any chance of a veto.

   "This is a very important step forward," said Mathilde
Krim, president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
"It shows that the federal government realizes that the care
area needs attention. The government has done very well on
research, but the care system in this country has been
deficient."
   The bill's co-sponsors, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a
liberal, and Sen Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), a conservative,
built strong bipartisan support for the measure, which also
gathered strong backing from the health-care industry. Funds
will be targeted to 13 large cities that have reported 2,000
or more cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Hospitals in these cities are providing millions of dollars a
year in care without compensation.
   In addition to easing the financial burden on hospitals,
the bill would help local health planners experiment with
providing less costly care for those suffering from acquired
immune deficiency in private homes, nursing facilities and
hospices. "There are no nursing home beds for people with
AIDS," Dr. Krim explained.
   The bill also would pay for 150 Food and Drug
Administration inspectors to monitor the nation's blood
supply to make it sure it is free of the AIDS virus.
   Four conservative Republicans voted against the bill --
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, William Roth of Delaware and Malcolm Wallop of
Wyoming.
