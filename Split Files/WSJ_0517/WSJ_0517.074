   NEW YORK -- Citicorp's Citibank Private Bank unit named
James R. Hocking chief investment officer of the U.S.
Investment division, signaling the bank's determination to
raise its profile as a manager of assets for wealthier
individuals.
   Mr. Hocking, 60 years old, joins Citibank from Templeton
International, a unit of Templeton Galbraith &amp; Hansberger
Ltd., the London money manager. As senior vice president and
portfolio manager there, his responsibilities included
creating and marketing mutual funds and managing portfolios.

   At Citibank, he will oversee more than 50 portfolio
managers who invest $15 billion for individuals of high net
worth. And Mr. Hocking will direct the bank's efforts for
U.S. customers who want to invest in overseas securities.
   In October 1988, Citicorp sold its Citicorp Investment
Management Inc. subsidiary, which invested pension-fund
assets for U.S. institutions. Other banks also have sold such
operations, which are "highly price-competitive," said David
E. Gibson, Citicorp's group executive for global private
banking. The company did maintain its international
institutional business.
   But having sold the U.S. institutional line, the bank
resolved to boost its individual private-banking work. "We
have a big involvement and a big commitment" to individual
private banking, but "we don't have the public image," the
50-year-old Mr. Gibson said. Through "selected important
personnel," including Mr. Hocking, the bank hopes to boost
that profile, he added.
