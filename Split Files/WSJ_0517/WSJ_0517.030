   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Stride Rite Corp. isn't likely to
offer Ronald J. Jackson a third shot at filling the boss's
shoes.
   Mr. Jackson, who has been president and chief executive
officer of the footwear retailer for just six months,
resigned to become president, chief executive officer and
chairman of Quaker Oats Co.'s Fisher-Price toy business,
which is scheduled to be spun off early next year.

   It's not the first time that Mr. Jackson, 46 years old,
has left Stride Rite for top posts in the toy business. In
1985, after serving as the company's president and chief
operating officer for only five months, Mr. Jackson left to
become president and chief executive of Kenner Parker Toys.
   When he rejoined Stride Rite last November, Mr. Jackson
said he planned to stay longer than he did the first time
around, and this time he did, albeit only by about a month.
   "There were a lot of questions at the time of whether Ron
would do the same thing again. He reassured the board that
would not be happening," said Stride Rite's executive vice
president and treasurer, John J. Phelan. He added, "In the
words of that famous philosopher Yogi Berra, `It's deja vu
all over again.'"
   Mr. Jackson couldn't immediately be reached for comment
yesterday.
   Stride Rite Chairman Arnold Hiatt will assume the
responsibilities of chief executive on a temporary basis
while the company searches for a replacement. "Arnold told me
that in all of his corporate years, this has been one of the
most devastating things he's experienced," Mr. Phelan said.
   Mr. Phelan said the Fisher-Price offer is "a wonderful
opportunity" for Mr. Jackson, noting that he'll get the
chairman's post as well. "How often does something like that
happen?"
   In a statement, Mr. Jackson said leaving Stride Rite was
an "extremely difficult decision," and that the Fisher-Price
offer was "too good to turn down."
   Quaker last month said it planned to spin off troubled
Fisher-Price to shareholders in early 1991 in order to
concentrate on its other businesses. Under the plan,
Fisher-Price would operate as an independent, publicly traded
company.
   But some Wall Street analysts now suggest -- and Quaker
won't dismiss the possibility -- that Quaker may decide
instead to sell the beleaguered toy business, should it
receive an adequate offer.
   "There have been some additional inquiries since our
announcement," a Quaker spokesman said, adding that while a
sale was possible, "it's our feeling that a spin-off approach
still offers the most shareholder value and we are proceeding
with that as quickly as we can."
   Quaker also announced yesterday that E. Robert Kinney, a
former chairman and chief executive of General Mills Inc. and
former chairman of Kenner Parker, which General Mills once
owned, would serve on Fisher-Price's board.
