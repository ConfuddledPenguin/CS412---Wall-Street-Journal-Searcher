   LONDON -- Europe's financial-services industry is headed
for major changes as the European Community's 1992 project to
knock down barriers to free trade becomes reality. With
increasing speed, the borders that protected banking markets
in West Germany, France, Britain and elsewhere are tumbling.
   Europe's ambitious plan is clearing a path for European
competitors, and for rivals from the U.S. and Japan, to tap a
single market of 320 million people. As a result, many banks
are embarking on an expensive wave of mergers and takeovers
to increase market share.

   While consumers anticipate such benefits as better service
and lower charges, many of Europe's bankers are headed for a
rude shock. Europe already has too many banks, with half the
deposits per capita of the U.S. but 20% more branches. That
situation is likely to worsen as the 1992 frenzy heats up.
   Increased competition, the opening of financial markets to
insurers and money-managers and a revolution in banking
technology probably will lead to a shake-out. The upheaval in
banking and finance, for centuries Europe's clubbiest of
businesses, could be greater than that confronting any other
industry.
   "The pace at which change is occurring is unprecedented,"
says Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse. "If you look at
history, bankers in Continental Europe have had pretty steady
development for the past 100 years. Now there is a new
situation, and I am sure a lot of mistakes are going to be
made."
   Harry Taylor, vice chairman of Safra Republic Holdings
S.A. and former president of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.,
likens the current European climate to the pressure-cooker
atmosphere in the U.S. when interstate-banking regulations
were changed, which led to hundreds of smaller banks being
swallowed up. Many of Europe's banks, Mr. Taylor says, "won't
be able to afford to continue as they have. Competition will
make margins shrink."
   A major factor behind the looming crunch is that national
trade barriers have allowed Europe's banks to remain
inefficient and under-competitive. Cashing a traveler's check
in Spain often can involve three tellers, two to process the
check and one to hand over the currency.
   Some French banks spend as much as 70% of their operating
income on overhead. By contrast, some U.S. banks spend only
55%. (The difference on average is narrower.)
   As a result, says Rodney Schwartz, a London-based banking
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the number of
European commercial banks could be halved, to about 800.
   When the dust settles from the 1992 shake-out, experts
foresee a Europe dominated by perhaps 15 pan-European giants,
combinations of the 20 or so European banks currently in the
world's top 50. Other than America's Citicorp, no
non-European competitor is likely to rank among them.
   To prepare for Europe without borders, more than
two-thirds of Europe's publicly traded banks have engaged in
mergers, takeovers and collaborations in the past few years.
The merger pace is intensifying as 1992 nears. The biggest
impact is on retail banking, which provides most of European
bank profits and subsidizes the melee of wholesale and
commercial banking, where the Americans and Japanese are
bigger players.
   Europe's biggest banks, such as Deutsche Bank, National
Westminster Bank PLC and Banque Nationale de Paris, are
prospecting for opportunities in almost every member country
of the European Community. NatWest, one of Britain's biggest
clearing-house institutions, already has expanded its network
to more than 150 branches in Spain and has raised its stake
to 80% of Dutch merchant bank F. van Lanschot Bankiers.
   And yesterday, NatWest said it's holding talks with Credit
Commercial de France aimed at buying the French company's
L'Europeenne de Banque subsidiary. In Rotterdam, Radobank
Nederland, a major Dutch cooperative-banking group, and the
Robeco Group of investment trusts disclosed that they plan "a
lasting strategic alliance" though not a merger.
   At Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, an official says: "We want
to be a leading European bank, and active in every European
country." The thirst for growth has led the big German bank
to spend more than three billion marks in the past four years
buying a major Italian network from BankAmerica Corp., a
Portuguese investment firm and a Dutch trade-finance company.
In December, Deutsche Bank bought Morgan Grenfell Group PLC
for about $1.4 billion, the largest takeover of an
investment-banking firm in history.
   Now, with German unification on the horizon, Deutsche Bank
is leading a charge into East Germany, with plans to
establish as many as 100 branches in a cooperation accord
with East Germany's Deutsche Kreditbank. But "our focus still
is on Europe '92," says the official, adding that it may be
years before Eastern Europe becomes an attractive banking
market.
   But for most banks, combinations thus far have been
amicable, arm-linking exercises to fend off even-bigger
interlopers and protect their home turf. Such deals "are
defensive," says Safra Republic's Mr. Taylor. "Banks are
making themselves units of a size indigestible to the vast
majority of other European banks."
   The volume and size of such combinations already are
stunning. Holland's two biggest banks, Amsterdam-Rotterdam
Bank N.V. and Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. are discussing a
combination to create Europe's seventh-largest bank, with a
40% share of certain home markets.
   Other mergers involving more than $125 billion in assets
have created Norway's and Denmark's biggest banks, and
shuffled the list of leaders in Sweden. In Spain, Banco
Hispano Americano bought 5% of Germany's Commerzbank, which
owns 10% of Hispano.
   The U.S. players in Europe, meanwhile, are split. Buffeted
by tough problems at home and burned in previous European
expansion, many U.S. banks are pulling in their horns.
   Only Citicorp is given much chance of emerging a big
pan-European player in retail and wholesale financial
services. However, such financial-service companies as
American Express Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. are making a
strong push in some European markets.
   Citicorp, already big in Europe with 18,000 employees in
21 countries, still is building. It may double its office
network through acquisitions -- though it won't say where --
and hopes to almost double its share of European households
with which it does business to 5% in the next few years. Its
strategy is to offer new products, such as mortgages in
Britain, insurance in Belgium and car loans in Italy, while
hammering at costs.
   James Robinson, American Express's chairman, told a Paris
gathering last week that Europe's market for charge cards "is
barely penetrated."
   Meantime, Japanese institutions are steadily increasing
their presence as the prospect of 1992 lures more of their
domestic clients to Europe.
   Bank of Yokohama acquired control of Britain's Guinness
Mahon Holdings PLC last year, and Sumitomo Bank has a
majority stake in Switzerland's Banca del Gottardo. Nomura
Securities Co. has doubled its European staff to about 2,000
in the past five years. "Europe has never been more
important," says an official. And the Japanese are expected
to become even more important players.
   The Eurobank marriages often make some strange bedfellows,
however, and some bankers are skeptical of the prospects for
success. Amro and ABN have been bitter rivals for a century,
and some bankers familiar with the two institutions say
combining their businesses may prove difficult.
   Previous betrothals, such as Amro's earlier plan to merge
with Belgium's Generale de Banque S.A., have fallen apart
because of the inability to bridge corporate-culture
differences, and to make tough decisions on cost-cutting and
strategy.
   Many experienced bankers warn that such alliances, while
creating a much stronger player if successful, often are
difficult to implement. "They are only as strong as the
weakest link. And the perfect balance is difficult to
achieve," says Credit Suisse's Mr. Gut.
