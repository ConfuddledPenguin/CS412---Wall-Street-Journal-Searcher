   Your April 6 article "Schoolteachers Say It's Wrongheaded
to Try to Teach Students What's Right" fills me with disgust
and despair. Of course, it is wrong to "pick up" a bicycle on
the street for one's child. Of course, it is right to rush
"into a burning building to save" a life. Of course, it is
right to lift "the moral standards of students above those of
their parents." I was under the impression that this was the
very essence of public education in America-socialization of
children to the core values of our culture. Every culture
must have some set of agreed-upon values. Without that
consensus, a society disintegrates into an agglomeration of
individuals, into chaos.
   Fortunately for my peers and me, our teachers did not
suffer from cultural ambiguity. They informed us clearly as
to why the Pilgrims left England. Must we now apologize that
religious freedom is a central value in this country?

   I am sick of the apologies and excuses. Are the core
values of "white, middle-class" America so inappropriate to
1990? Are respect, responsibility, compassion, honesty and
courage passe? If that is the case, then the future of
America is grim indeed.

   I do not want schoolteachers teaching my daughter values
and morals. Their job is to educate my child to prepare her
to locate, extricate and assimilate information to make up
her own mind. And, it is hoped, they can teach her to
communicate, so that she might share her mind with others.
And I also expect them to have freedom to enforce the
discipline necessary to maintain an atmosphere conducive to
learning.
   I feel that it is my duty and my privilege to teach my
child values and morals at home. And I realize that the most
effective, if not the only, method I have at my disposal is
the example I set.
   My advice to this "growing number of parents, worried that
their children aren't building good character" is to take
stock of their own lives. What kind of role models are they
providing their children? Therein might very well lie the
reason why their children appear to be lacking in "good
character."

   I am a public-high-school teacher in my 35th year of
teaching. I share with the teachers of business education in
my high school the opinion that they would never want to do
business with many of the young people in their classes.
These young people are totally dedicated to the principle
that a citizen of the U.S. should be able to cheat and rip
off anyone as long as they don't get punished.
   I don't think that my students resent my teaching that
honesty is the best policy. I teach them the ethic of
Aristotle, that total honesty is the very heart of human
happiness and fulfillment. Whoever lies to himself or herself
and therefore lies to anyone else robs himself or herself of
the joy of being a fully integrated person. Any teacher in
public high schools who would avoid teaching the value of
basic honesty should never be a teacher of our children.
These children of our nation were not born corrupt. We teach
them to be corrupt. Any public-school teacher who avoids
teaching honesty teaches those children dishonesty. There are
no religious overtones to such teaching. Whether there be a
God or not has nothing to do with teaching children basic
honesty.

   Moral education taught in the manner suggested in your
article is nothing more than indoctrination. Indoctrination
is not education. Furthermore, what makes us think that the
moral and ethical decisions that our children will be making
in the future will be at all similar to the decisions we are
making today?
   Ethical and moral decisions are becoming increasingly
complex. Children need the tools and skills to make these
choices, not indoctrination. They need to be taught the
skills of ethical inquiry, skills that will improve their
reasoning ability and help them make better ethical decisions
not just today but tomorrow also.

   Through the 1960s and into the 1970s educators were forced
into the position of trying to teach a value-free education,
an impossible position, morally speaking. To teach a moral
stance was rather looked upon as trying to "impose values."
Responses to moral issues thus became a matter of preference,
sometimes looked upon with equal value. Philosophy, logic,
ethics and moral principles were something to be inferred
rather than directly taught.
   Creating a separate curriculum agenda on morality may be a
response to the weaknesses identified in the survey. It is
definitely fraught with the difficulties you have identified.
