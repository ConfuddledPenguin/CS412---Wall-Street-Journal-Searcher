   SEOUL, South Korea -- Kim Young Ki is a national hero in
Korea. The scrawny 51-year-old shopkeeper earned the
adulation of his countrymen by setting a world pushup record
last summer. As hundreds of supporters cheered him on in the
ballroom of a fancy hotel here, he did 35,305 in 24 hours.
   But that wasn't enough for Mr. Kim. He wanted to prove
beyond a doubt his nation's superiority in upper-body
strength and stamina. So he went on to set two more world
records -- for one-finger chin-ups (16) and two-finger
chin-ups (31).

   "I did it," Mr. Kim says, "for Korea. It is a good way to
publicize the character of the Korean nation to the world."
   For all its economic success, South Korea doesn't believe
it gets the respect it deserves from the rest of the
developed world. Many here think the cure for a poor image is
to snare world records. "The more records we have leads to
world power," says Ji Young Mo.
   Mr. Ji is the director of Korea Guinness Association, an
organization formed last year for the sole purpose of getting
Korean feats and records recognized by the Guinness Book of
World Records. Some 3,000 members pay $50 a year to support
the association's efforts, which include sending teams of
certifiers from town to town in search of the extraordinary.
   Among the world records in which the association takes
pride: The tiny village of Chungchun in Chonam province, with
275 families, has 38 sets of twins. (University researchers
haven't yet come up with any explanation.) The Lotte World
Hotel has the world's largest chandelier in its lobby; it
weighs 10.5 tons and holds 700 lightbulbs. And the
Unification Church's Rev. Sun Myung Moon performed the
largest mass wedding ceremony when he married 6,516 couples
from 83 countries at a barley-cola bottling plant near Seoul.
   Few things surprise the people at Guinness, and
understandably so for the arbiters of such things as
eel-eating contests. But even they admit to being somewhat
taken aback by the effort. Korea's record-setting mania is
"rather unique," says Donald McFarlan, editor of the
London-based record book. "I know they are very determined."
   In only a year, Korea has managed to get 19 records listed
in the Guinness Book; it hadn't had any before that. Korea
does take some liberties in claiming records, however. Among
the 19 is one for the world's tallest hotel, the 73-story
Westin Stamford in Raffles City, Singapore. Korea believes it
can claim the credit because a Korean construction firm built
it.
   In any case, Mr. Ji believes South Korea will have enough
records by the end of the year to put it within striking
distance of its arch-rival, Japan, which has about 50. "We
need to have more than Japan to prove that we are better than
they are," he says.
   Achieving Guinness greatness is just a matter of having
the right attitude, Mr. Ji adds. Mr. Kim, the push-up
champion also known as Korea's Popeye, says he was sustained
during the marathon, despite the pain of his ulcers, by the
thought that he would snatch the record from an Englishman.
"He has a strong will to beat foreigners," Mr. Ji says.
   Mr. Ji's dream is to best the U.S., currently the champion
Guinness record-setter with 250. Americans are big on food
feats. Selinsgrove, Pa., for instance, won the distinction of
being a town of world-class jerks. Soda, that is. Two years
ago, residents created the longest banana split: 4.55 miles.
   Korea's passion for records was ignited during the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul, which the nation saw as an
opportunity to showcase its economic, cultural and athletic
achievements. The Games gave the nation its first records --
the most competitors in an Olympics, 9,302; the most nations
competing, 160; and, for the opening ceremonies, the world's
biggest drum. The Games whetted the Koreans' appetite for
more records.
   Mr. Ji, 33, is consumed by the quest. From a dingy office
here, the former television sportscaster spends his days
seeking records and getting them certified. He is anxiously
awaiting word from Guinness on a man who claims to have
written 243 Chinese characters on a grain of rice.
   Mr. Ji has learned, to his dismay, that Guinness is tough
to satisfy. It wants records that are measurable and
comparable. Events have to be witnessed by an independent
adult and corroborated by press coverage. And it refuses to
certify stunts it considers "gratuitously dangerous." Mr. Ji
recently sought certification for a seven-year-old boy who
pulled a car with his teeth. But the Guinness people refused,
in part because the feat wasn't "wholesome."
   To encourage competition, Mr. Ji hosts meets at which
people vie to set records. Some 5,000 onlookers showed up at
a meet last fall to witness, among other things, a man bounce
a soccer ball off his head for 5 hours, 6 minutes and 30
seconds. He set a record, but a few months later, it was
broken. Scheduled for the next meets are such events as an
onion-peeling competition, a race in which contestants
balance eggs on spoons, and a bubble-gum blowing contest.
   Foreigners aren't welcome. Michael Skowron, a German
language teacher in Seoul, found out the hard way when he
sought to compete in a "vertical marathon," a race up 52
flights of stairs in Seoul's World Trade Center. The winner
would be sent to the world championships in Singapore. The
Koreans initially barred Mr. Skowron and an American from the
race, but relented after the pair protested. "They told us,
`You can compete, but you can't win,'" Mr. Skowron recalls.
   The Koreans have had some disappointments in their quest
for records. Earlier this year, Mr. Ji sought certification
for the rock with the biggest natural hole (1.9 meters by 1.1
meters). But Guinness didn't have such a category, and it
refused to consider the entry. And Pohang Steel, the world's
biggest steelmaker in 1988, lost that title to its Japanese
nemesis, Nippon Steel, last year.
   Korea would easily win some records, if it cared to submit
them to Guinness. Press reports suggest that Korea uses more
tear gas than any other country -- to quell
ever-demonstrating students and laborers. And Korea's per
capita consumption of garlic and red pepper is generally
acknowledged to be world class. But neither of those are
likely to show up in the record book any time soon.
   "The Guinness people are always asking us whether the
Koreans eat the most dogs," says Mr. Ji, who adds that he
wouldn't consider documenting a record that didn't burnish
the nation's image. "I try to find good things."
