   BURBANK, Calif. -- "Peter Pan," the story of the boy who
never grows old, will be the next Walt Disney animated
classic released on videotape, Walt Disney Home Video said.
   The movie will be listed at $24.99. But the Walt Disney
Co. subsidiary is linking up with certain Nabisco crackers to
offer a $5 rebate.

   The company said the rebate price is the lowest retail
price yet for The Disney Classics series of videotapes, which
most recently featured "The Little Mermaid." Others in the
series have been "Bambi," "Robin Hood," "Pinocchio,"
"Sleeping Beauty," "Lady and the Tramp," "Cinderella" and
Touchstone Picture's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
   Since the initial release of "Peter Pan" in 1953, the
animated feature has been re-released in theaters six times,
Disney said, grossing $145 million in current dollars. The
company plans to herald the videotape with an extensive,
national advertising campaign.
