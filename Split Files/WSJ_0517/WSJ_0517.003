   I should like to propose a solution to the fight over
preserving Lockwood, the Virginia farmhouse where Gen. Robert
E. Lee spent several nights before a crucial battle to defend
Richmond (page one, April 18).
   While the illustration accompanying the article showed a
very simple, pretty house, the description of its current
state revealed a dilapidation and overwhelming invasion of
termites that would make it absurdly expensive to restore and
maintain. I therefore propose putting a historical marker on
the site of Lockwood and making sure that any available
photographs or other illustrations of the place as it was in
Gen. Lee's day are included in the Virginia Historical
Society's collection.

   I must say to J. Stewart Bryan III, whose company Media
General Inc. is threatening to tear down the structure, that
it is unfortunate he does not see the true importance of
preservation. His family may have been in the forefront of
the preservation movement in Virginia, but in demolishing
this historic home, he will single-handedly wipe out his
family's philanthropic beliefs in saving American heritage.
   What will future generations glean from our past societies
if all they have to experience is the Breakers, Biltmore and
Monticello? I would hope that Mr. Bryan can put aside his
mortal reasoning and present to my children's children a
piece of vernacular American history when they travel down a
Virginia road someday.

   Please be advised that the Commonwealth of Virginia is
rich in most of God's blessings, and beautiful homes of
historical significance are no exception. Should anyone
attempt to damage Westover, Berkeley, Carter's Grove,
Prestwould, Monticello, Mount Vernon, Sherwood Forest,
Shirley Plantation, Stratford Hall, etc., then I would wager
the Bryan family would lead the troops in a successful
defense. However, for Lockwood?
