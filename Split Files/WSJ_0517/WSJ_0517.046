   Kay Jewelers Inc.'s lenders appear to be losing faith in
the financially troubled jewelry retailing chain.
   Four banks have pulled $16.5 million in lines of credit
since March 16, and three of them would like to withdraw $32
million more, said Michael R. Lavington, Kay's president and
chief operating officer, elaborating on the company's
first-quarter 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The company currently has $86 million in lines of
credit, of which $75 million has been used.

   Mr. Lavington said the reluctant lenders aren't demanding
immediate repayment of the $31 million Kay has borrowed
against the $32 million line. "They are willing to work with
us," he said.
   To solve the credit crunch, Kay is seeking to replace all
of its credit lines with a one-year committed revolving
credit agreement for $80 million to $90 million to meet
seasonal borrowing needs. Mr. Lavington said the Alexandria,
Va., company is in negotiations with several banks to create
such a "revolver" and he expects an agreement to be in place
within six to eight weeks. In the meantime, he said, the $11
million available under existing credit lines should be
"quite adequate.
   "It's certainly tight, but it's manageable," Mr. Lavington
said. "We're fairly close to our peak levels of borrowing
right now." Jewelry retailers such as Kay typically have
negative cash flow for the first nine months of the year. As
of March 31, Kay had only $114,000 in cash.
   In the 10-Q filing, Kay also said that banks providing
$22.5 million of a $90 million letter of credit don't intend
to renew their participation when the agreement expires in
July. Kay is required to maintain the $90 million letter as a
condition of its ongoing agreement to sell its credit card
receivables to NCNB National Bank.
   Mr. Lavington said Kay is seeking a replacement for the
non-renewing banks in the letter of credit.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Kay shares plunged $2.375, to $7.50.
   Kay has been experiencing credit-related problems for
several years. In 1988, the company sold its credit-card
receivables to NCNB to raise cash, and last year the company
floated $100 million in junk bonds. Kay's lenders have become
increasingly skittish, and the company's lines of credit have
been steadily shrinking for several quarters.
   In the first quarter, Kay had a loss of $5.6 million, or
45 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $3.8
million, or 31 cents a share.
   In January, Kay put its Black, Starr &amp; Frost stores on the
auction block, and Mr. Lavington said there is a "very good
chance" the company will sell the division within two or
three months, as required under draft terms of the revolving
credit agreement being negotiated. Failing that, Mr.
Lavington said, the company must add $10 million in equity,
probably through the sale of common stock.
   Kay is holding its annual meeting this morning in
Alexandria.
