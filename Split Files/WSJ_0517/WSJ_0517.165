   MATERIAL SHORTAGES wane but prompt few worries of a slack
economy.
   The list of industrial materials in short supply has
dwindled to a handful, due to both increased capacity and
slowing demand, says Bob Bretz of the National Association of
Purchasing Management. That's unusual at this stage of a
business expansion, when shortages and production bottlenecks
often signal higher inflation and then recession, says Norman
Robertson, chief economist of the Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh.

   The trend isn't triggering oversupply worries either, says
Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of
Manufacturers, who credits "better balance" and more
sophisticated inventory controls. It is, however, keeping
prices down, says David Littmann of Manufacturers National
Bank of Detroit, noting that price pressure is flat "for the
first time in many years." And that, he says, bodes well for
lower interest rates.
   Environmental worries prompt some shortages. Paper mills,
trying to reduce dioxin pollution, scramble for chemicals to
replace chlorine in whitening paper.
                                                                                                       

   PROM SPENDING is strong, but a smaller teen population
limits the market.
   "You can't get more lavish than it has been," says Richard
Wiewiorka, of the Fairmont Hotel's Tonga Room, San Francisco,
which is sold out almost every weekend from April through
June. Or can you? The hunt for prom gowns began in February
instead of April this year, with some girls spending as much
as $700, says Jacalyn Dunn of Jacalyn's Lace &amp; Promises,
Pittsburgh. Rent-A-Stretch Inc., Hackensack, N.J., cites new
demand for $100-an-hour stretch limos.
   Cost per couple: $300 to $1,000, says Your Prom magazine,
launched this year to tap the lucrative market. But some
businesses say lavish spending isn't enough to keep the prom
market growing. "Flat demographics," explains Michael Kashman
of Gingiss Formal Wear, New York. Bill Gallagher of Town &amp;
Country Tuxedos, East Meadow, N.Y., says the graduating class
at one local high school dropped from some 700 students 11
years ago to only 175.
                                                                                                       

   DOCTORS AND DENTISTS are expected to tell more patients to
charge it.
   With traditional credit-card markets nearly saturated,
attention is shifting to health care. "It is a tremendous
market," but no one has paid much attention to it, says H.
Spencer Nilson of the Nilson Report, Los Angeles. He
estimates only 3% of consumers' out-of-pocket medical
expenses now are charged on credit cards. Why? "Doctors have
looked at themselves as professionals and above credit
cards," says Stephen Getzoff, an Encino, Calif., accountant
who specializes in medical practices.
   But that is changing as doctors, under pressure from
insurers and other medical providers, look for ways to
improve cash flow. Visa USA launches a program to woo
doctors, designing both new signs and new ways for patients
to pay. Medical credit cards -- such as MedMaster Systems
Inc., Logan, Utah -- welcome the Visa push. "It is like being
a Burger King on a McDonald's corner," says David Whipple of
MedMaster, which also provides back-office services.
   Doctors may begin offering patients a discount for cash
when faced with credit-card fees, Mr. Getzoff says.
                                                                                                       

   HE WEARS THE PANTS but she buys them, says a survey from
MRCA Information Services. In 1989, women bought 78% of men's
sweaters, 71% of men's socks and 70% of men's sport shirts.
But they bought only 23% of men's suits, apparently letting
men pick out their own.
                                                                                                       

   IT LOSES SOMETHING in the translation, admits Di Jin, who
is translating James Joyce's "Ulysses" into Chinese. The
visiting fellow at University of Virginia says puns, literary
allusion and political references make the work particularly
hard for Chinese to understand.
                                                                                                       

   SUPERMARKET SKILLS will be taught in a new
mini-supermarket being set up in Walton High School
classroom, New York. Sponsored by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific
Tea Co. and Cornell University, the project will teach
students to price units, stock shelves and process orders.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN ATHLETES find more equipment designed just for them.
   Women who used to settle for men's sports gear are
starting to demand their own, says Patricia Hubbard, editor
of Outdoor Woman, Nyack, N.Y. Sporting-goods manufacturers
are responding with everything from specially-sized kayaks to
fly-fishing rods for women. Orvis Co., Manchester, Vt.,
recently came out with a pair of lightweight women's waders
in fashionable burgundy. Sawyer Canoe Co. offers models that
can be portaged and maneuvered solo by a 110-pound to
150-pound person.
   Why the interest? "Sporting-goods manufacturers have
recognized that the men's niche has topped out," says Missy
Park, president of Title 9, a Berkeley, Calif., mail order
house that caters to "athletic women." But some retailers
have a hard time selling women's gear, she says, because
they're used to targeting men.
   More women outfitters are organizing women's expeditions,
says Ms. Hubbard, noting it's often easier to learn skills
when men aren't around.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: To woo accepted students, the College of Wooster
lets them "test drive" the school's academic computer before
deciding whether to enroll. . . . A campaign that aims to
enlist Sen. Alan Simpson in helping to bring back the buffalo
nickel calls on people to "join the herd."
