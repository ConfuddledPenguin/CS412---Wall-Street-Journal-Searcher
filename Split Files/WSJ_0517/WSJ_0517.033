   Earlier this year civil rights activists drafted a bill
that looked like a plaintiff's lawyer's wish list, and dubbed
it the Civil Rights Act of 1990. The bill (also known as the
Kennedy-Hawkins bill) made some reasonable proposals, but it
featured a devastating triple whammy that would have (1)
placed the burden of proof on employers with a racially (or
sexually) unbalanced workforce to prove that (2) all of their
employment practices were (3) "essential to effective job
performance." Since this is an almost impossible burden to
meet, the message to employers would have been clear: Hire by
quota or face expensive and burdensome lawsuits you almost
certainly cannot win.
   This surely not unintended effect was pointed out in the
ensuing public debate, and was emphasized by veto rumblings
from the executive branch. Rochefoucauld said that hypocrisy
is the homage vice pays to virtue. Caught with their hands in
the quota cookie jar (again), Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,
Mass.), Rep. August Hawkins (D., Calif.) and other proponents
of the act changed "essential to effective job performance"
to "bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to
effective job performance." Certainly this looks as if it
might take the quota heat off a little bit. And that is why
the friends of quotas could not really leave it at that. They
had to add that the employer trying to defend himself by this
standard must do so "by objective evidence."

   Now this innocent-sounding phrase (what could be wrong
about demanding objective evidence?) evidently got by a few
Republican lawmakers who were eager for peace on this front
and looking for a face-saving way to give in. But to
professionals in this field (and those who added those words
certainly are that) "objective evidence" has a technical and
lethal meaning: "objective evidence" means validation
studies. And validation studies are elaborate and costly
studies usually prepared by industrial psychologists on a
consultant basis. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor pointed out
in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust in 1988, these can be
so burdensome that an employer would often rather flee to the
safe harbor of quota hiring than have to sponsor and pay for
such studies. (This reference to "objective evidence" is so
harsh, that one suspects a trick: it will be traded away
against a few more Republican defections, leaving behind the
phrase "substantial and demonstrable" to do the same work.)
   Add to this that Kennedy-Hawkins still puts the burden on
the employer and still does not require the plaintiff to
identify what practices he or she is complaining about. The
result is that an employer who has not met his quota must
prove by offering these expensive psychological studies that
virtually everything he does that might bear on the racial or
gender composition of his workforce "bears a substantial and
demonstrable relationship to effective job performance."
   Testifying in favor of the original version of
Kennedy-Hawkins, Ray Marshall, President Carter's secretary
of labor, who is not a lawyer and therefore a bit more
forthright about these things, let the cat out of the bag.
The quota pressures in the bill were no bad thing, he said,
because they would encourage employers to train the minority
employees they might otherwise not have hired. There are
several things wrong with that argument. First, it might not
work. Instead, employers might just take their jobs to Taiwan
or Mexico, or at any rate out of racially diverse labor
pools.
   But more important, if an employer is truly innocent of
discrimination, society has no right to tell him who to hire
and who to train or how to run his business. The private
institutions of this country -- so long as they do not
discriminate -- don't belong to Mr. Marshall, or Rep. Hawkins
or Sen. Kennedy, to be used as the tools of their particular
visions of industrial or social policy.
