   A federal judge ruled that a psychiatrist who bought
BankAmerica Corp. stock based on information he allegedly
received from a patient during therapy can be charged with
insider trading.
   The case seems to break new ground in determining who can
be charged with insider trading, since it apparently is the
first to accuse a doctor of trading on confidential
information from a patient. The case also is one of the first
to apply a federal appeals-court decision two weeks ago,
involving stockbroker Robert Chestman, that restricted the
scope of insider-trading laws. The federal judge in New York
said that even under the guidelines of the Chestman decision,
the charges against the psychiatrist, Robert Howard Willis,
shouldn't be dropped.

   Dr. Willis is charged with buying the stock in early 1986
after learning that Sanford Weill, former chief executive
officer of Shearson Loeb Rhodes, was seeking to become
BankAmerica's chief executive officer. Previously, court
documents have identified the patient as "Jane Doe," who was
upset because her husband would have to move if Mr. Weill
took the job. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, in her written
decision, however, disclosed that the patient is Mr. Weill's
wife.
   Dr. Willis argued that the charges against him should be
dropped because he violated no fiduciary duty in allegedly
trading on the information. He also claimed that under the
Chestman decision he needed to have been specifically told
that the information was confidential. Dr. Willis, charged
with 46 counts of securities fraud and mail fraud, is accused
of making a profit of $27,475 on the transactions.
   Judge Cedarbaum, however, ruled that because of the
tradition of physician-patient confidentiality, Dr. Willis
should have known from the start that any information gleaned
from Mrs. Weill was to remain secret. She also said that
allegations against Dr. Willis amounted to theft of valuable
information from Mrs. Weill.
   "It is difficult to imagine a relationship that requires a
higher degree of trust and confidence than the traditional
relationship of physician and patient," Judge Cedarbaum said.
Unlike circumstances in the Chestman case, where the
defendant wasn't informed that a stock tip he received was
confidential, Judge Cedarbaum said Dr. Willis knew he was
receiving information in confidence from Mrs. Weill.
   Judge Cedarbaum also said the alleged insider trading
defrauded Mrs. Weill in two ways. First, she had an interest
in Mr. Weill's possible advancement at BankAmerica, which the
judge said could have been jeopardized by disclosure of the
information. Second, the judge said, Mrs. Weill "had a
property interest in a continuing course of psychiatric
treatment. . . . Dr. Willis's disclosures jeopardized the
psychiatrict-patient relationship and put at risk the
patient's financial investment in psychiatric treatment."
   Mr. Weill currently is chairman of Primerica Corp.
   Edward Brodsky, a lawyer for Dr. Willis, said he believed
that under the Chestman case, the charges against Dr. Willis
should have been dropped. Also, he said, Dr. Willis didn't
violate the type of fiduciary responsibility that is required
for there to have been a securities-law violation. "Patient
confidentiality doesn't extend to securities law," he said.

   RED SQUIRRELS won't stand in the way of Arizona
observatory, court says.
   In a decision that some environmentalists fear may weaken
the federal Endangered Species Act, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned a ruling that had suspended a
University of Arizona plan to build the $200 million
observatory on Arizona's Mount Graham. But the San
Francisco-based appeals court said the stay on construction
could be reinstated if evidence emerges of a threat to the
180 red squirrels that live on the mountain.
   Congress initially authorized the project on the basis of
a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report that found that the
observatory wouldn't significantly harm the squirrels. Two
Fish and Wildlife Service officials later said in depositions
that they had suppressed their misgivings about the project.
"The government biologists wanted to say there was danger to
the squirrels, but politics got in the way," said Brock
Evans, vice president of national issues at the National
Audubon Society, one of the plaintiffs in the case.
   Environmentalists have expressed concern that the court's
decision reflects an unwillingness to reverse congressional
approval for a project even though some of the evidence may
have been fraudulent or erroneous. A spokesman for the
Maricopa Audubon Society in Arizona said the court
effectively sides with those "who have said the project's
going to continue no matter what, regardless of what Congress
said about their intentions to not weaken the Endangered
Species Act."
   Plaintiffs' lawyers wouldn't comment on the decision,
saying the judge instructed the parties not to discuss the
specifics of the case.
   John Moag, a lawyer representing the university from the
Baltimore office of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow, said Congress
closely followed the guidelines of the Endangered Species Act
"in balancing the purposes of the project against the
possible negative impact" on the squirrels. The university
had argued that its monitoring and feeding of the squirrels
would reduce the possibility of extinction. "I think we're
going to be an integral factor in this squirrel's survival,"
Mr. Moag said.
   A red squirrel is named as a plaintiff in the case,
although "no one actually suggested that the squirrel should
appear in court," according to a University of Arizona
spokesman.

   CENSORSHIP SUIT challenges ban on filming of "Bonfire"
scene in courtroom.
   The suit involves the decision by New Jersey Chief Justice
Robert Wilentz preventing a production crew from filming a
scene from "The Bonfire of the Vanities" in an Essex County
courthouse in Newark. Judge Wilentz said in his ruling that
the scene showing a group of black citizens rioting "could
serve to seriously undermine the confidence of black citizens
in our court system."
   In the lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court in Newark,
Essex County Executive Nicholas R. Amato and the county
alleged that the judge had acted as a censor in violation of
the First Amendment. A spokesman for Judge Wilentz said he
couldn't comment on pending litigation.
   Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit, which is producing
the film based on the novel by Tom Wolfe, had agreed to
donate $250,000 to the courthouse-restoration fund for the
use of the courtroom. Ultimately the scene was filmed in the
courthouse in Queens, N.Y.
   "The county has historically used court buildings for the
filming of movies as a revenue source. We want to get the
groundwork laid on how much control the chief justice has
over filming in county-owned property," said H. Curtis
Meanor, Essex County counsel.
   Mr. Meanor said the county will seek to recoup the lost
fee from the state judiciary as monetary damages.

   FAT BOYS rap group wins right to sue Miller Brewing Co.
over commercial.
   In federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., Judge Charles Haight
rejected a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which claims that a
commercial featuring Joe Piscopo and imitators of the
rap-music group infringes on the group's copyrights and
trademarks. The defendants, who also include Mr. Piscopo and
the advertising firm Backer &amp; Spielvogel, argued that the
case should be thrown out because the commercial was a parody
of the rap group's style, rather than a ripoff of the group's
work.
   Judge Haight said the commercial wasn't protected as
parody, however, because its "use is entirely for profit: to
sell beer." The judge said that based on previous cases,
"appropriation of copyrighted material solely for personal
profit, unrelieved by any creative purpose, cannot constitute
parody as a matter of law."
   Judge Haight, however, did throw out a part of the lawsuit
charging that the commercial defamed the group, whose members
are all under 21. They claimed that their reputations were
hurt and business prospects damaged because the commercial
implied that they promoted the drinking of alcoholic
beverages by minors. The judge said the look-alike group's
behavior in the ad was unlikely to be seen as an endorsement
of under-age drinking.
   Lawyers for the defendants couldn't be reached for
comment.
