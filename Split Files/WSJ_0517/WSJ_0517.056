   OTTAWA -- G. Heileman Brewing Co. of LaCrosse, Wis., filed
a complaint with the U.S. government against Canadian import
restrictions that it said are costing it a potentially
attractive market for its beer.
   Heileman said its petition under Section 301 of the U.S.
Trade Act calls for U.S. retaliation against the allegedly
discriminatory practices of provincial government beer
outlets in pricing and distribution of U.S. beer. Heileman, a
unit of Bond Corp. Holdings of Australia, said the trade
barriers prevent Canadian consumers access to U.S. beer at
"fair-market prices, which are considerably less than the
prices charged by Canadian brewers."

   Provincial liquor-control authorities can limit the number
of listings granted to imported brands in government-owned
liquor stores.
   Provincial practices place an "unjustifiable, unreasonable
and discriminatory burden on U.S. commerce," said Bob
Bennardo, Heileman managing director.
   Heileman and some other U.S. brewers had made significant
inroads into the Canadian market by cutting prices of brands
listed in government-controlled stores. But, responding to
complaints from Canadian breweries, the Ontario government
last summer boosted the handling charges for imported U.S.
beer by 57 U.S. cents for six cans or bottles. Heileman said
sales of its Lone Star brand fell from a peak of 350,000
cases a month in Ontario to 2,000 cases after the markup was
introduced.
   Canadian breweries have close links with some major U.S.
breweries, producing under license leading brands such as
Budweiser, Coors and Miller, which are sold in Canada in
industry-owned stores. But brands such as Heileman's Lone
Star and Rainier can only be purchased in provincial
government-owned stores at what Heileman says are unfairly
high prices.
   Heileman is the fifth-largest brewer in the U.S., where it
has been hurt by declining sales. A Heileman spokesman said
at a news conference that the trade complaint wasn't
initiated because of the company's financial problems.
   A spokeswoman for the Brewers Association of Canada, an
industry group, said sales of imported beer from the U.S.
have grown 150% since 1987 and listings of U.S. imports are
up 21%. "The market in Canada really has been opening up over
the past few years," she said. "We don't think (Heileman) has
much of a case."
   U.S. imports account for 4% of the Canadian market. In
some provinces, including Alberta and British Columbia, the
market share is about 10%.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Canadian Trade
Minister John Crosbie are expected to discuss the issue at a
meeting tomorrow. A spokesman for the U.S. trade
representative said the office has 45 days to study the
petition.
   The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based
organization that regulates trade between most non-socialist
countries, already has ruled that practices used by
provincial liquor-control boards are unfairly discriminatory
against beer imports.
