   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. closed down
Hallmark Savings Association, Plano, Texas, and paid its
depositors.
   The RTC, the savings-and-loan bailout agency, said it
received no acceptable bids for a sale or transfer of the
thrift, which has $143.5 million in assets and $196.3 million
in deposits.

   The payment of insured depositors will begin in a few
days, the RTC said, at a place and time to be announced.
   The RTC has targeted 141 institutions for sale or
liquidation in the April-June quarter. Any of those thrifts
that don't receive acceptable bids will be liquidated, agency
officials have said.
