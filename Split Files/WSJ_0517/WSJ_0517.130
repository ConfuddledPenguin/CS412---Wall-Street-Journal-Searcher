   Delaware &amp; Hudson owns about 600 miles of track and has
rights to run its trains on an additional 900 miles.
Acquiring the U.S. railroad is part of CP Rail's strategy of
adding north-south rail routes connecting Canada and the U.S.
   Canadian Pacific is a Montreal transportation, resources,
telecommunications and real estate concern.
