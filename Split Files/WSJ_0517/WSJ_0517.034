   The popular view of P.T. Barnum as a cynical exploiter of
the world's suckers is off the mark, A.H. Saxon argues in a
brave work of literary rehabilitation, "P.T. Barnum, The
Legend and the Man" (Columbia University Press, 488 pages,
$32.95). Barnum never even said, "There's a sucker born every
minute." Credit for that line should go to a con man by the
name of Paper Collar Joe, whose exact words were "There is a
sucker born every minute, but none of them ever die."
   But if Barnum didn't even utter this most infamous quote,
just what did he do to achieve his notoriety? Plenty, as Mr.
Saxon tells us in this entertainingly scholarly work.

   Barnum's first success was with Joice Heth, a case in
which even the most loyal Barnumite must acknowledge a touch
of audience manipulation. Heth, 161 years old, had been the
nurse of George Washington, Barnum told his customers, who
shelled out $1,500 a week to hear this extraordinary woman
sing hymns and tell stories about "little George." Rented
from her Kentucky master in 1835, she charmed the crowds
until her death a year later.
   Then came the moment of truth: A large audience of
doctors, scientists and editors gathered to watch as Ms. Heth
was dissected (admission: 50 cents). The scientific
consensus: She was a bit younger than claimed -- probably 80
years or so.
   Then there were Barnum's three dwarfs: Gen. Tom Thumb,
under 24 inches, 16 pounds; Commodore Nutt, 29 inches, 25
pounds; and Adm. Dot, dimensions unlisted. A 60,000-mile,
587-city world tour followed Gen. Thumb's marriage to Mercy
Lavinia Warren Bump (32 inches, 29 pounds), underscoring the
popularity of these acts. But Barnum had higher goals than
full employment for dwarfs and freaks, despite what you hear
from his detractors.
   Instead, he argued, his "curiosities" were used merely to
get people in the door, after which they were exposed to
educational exhibits, lectures and theatrical extravaganzas.
His "Nero" and "The Fall of Babylon," for example, each
employed over 1,000 actors and dancers. His temperance
productions instructed many in that arcane discipline. Barnum
also brought famed singer Jenny Lind to America, plus a
multicultural lineup billed as the "Ethnological Congress of
Savage Tribes," which included "bestial Australian cannibals"
and "dusky idolatrous Hindus."
   We laugh now, but at a time when few Americans could
afford to travel, Barnum brought the world to America. He
tried to get Sitting Bull, but the famous Indian had already
been signed up by Buffalo Bill. He offered Brigham Young
$200,000 to be exhibited, but the prophet turned him down.
   He was, in short, a master showman, but there was a lot
more to Barnum than show biz. Besides being a passionate
advocate of temperance, Christianity and Republicanism,
Barnum was also a state legislator, a mayor of Bridgeport,
Conn., and an early believer in black enfranchisement.
   A human soul, he proclaimed, "that God has created and
Christ died for, is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the
body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot -- it is
still an immortal spirit; and amid all the assumptions of
caste, it will in due time vindicate the great fact that,
without regard to color or condition, all men are equally
children of the common Father."
   So spoke a man with a good heart and a powerful vision, a
man who has suffered a century-long smear job.
   What's more, Barnum also performed his artistry without a
single grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Quite
the contrary, he paid his way, selling 42 million museum
tickets and staging enormously popular roadshows. Then there
was, and is, his fabulous circus.
   So the question is, who has done more to enrich American
culture: the man with the Fejee Mermaid, or the tax-financed
creators of masterpieces like "Hermaphrodite Sucking the
Blood Out of a Dead Dog"?
   The answer's obvious, is it not? Hail Barnum. And thank
you, Mr. Saxon.
