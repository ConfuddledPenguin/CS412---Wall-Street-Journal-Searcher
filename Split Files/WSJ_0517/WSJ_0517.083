   Concerns over a sharp rise in the U.S. dollar sent Taiwan
shares tumbling Wednesday, driving the weighted index down
5.96%, its second-largest single-day loss in percentage
terms.
   Tokyo stocks finished slightly lower and London shares
were firmer.

   Taiwan investors feared that a higher U.S. dollar is
accelerating capital outflow, hurting stock market
development.
   The U.S. dollar hit a 14-month high Tuesday, ending at
27.5 New Taiwan dollars, up sharply from 26.4351 Monday.
   "Shares are dropping like a slide," said one broker.
"Investors are panicking to dump stocks."
   Taiwan's weighted index, which advanced 294.53 points
Tuesday, plummeted 510.41 points, finishing at 8059.14, the
lowest closing level since July 15, 1989.
   Trading volume including stocks and mutual funds totaled
about 1.62 billion shares, up from 972.3 million Tuesday.
   Losers outpaced gainers by 193 to 2, with one stock ending
unchanged.
   The market opened firmer, fueled by gains on export-driven
sectors such as textiles and electronics. Players bought
these stocks as they thought a higher U.S. dollar would give
local companies a competitive edge. The index had an intraday
high of 8689.79 points, up 120.24.
   The strength, however, quickly disappeared as renewed
concerns over continued capital outflow prevailed and caused
bouts of selling, traders said.
   According to newspapers, Taiwan's capital outflow is
US$5.7 billion so far this year, compared with US$8.25
billion in 1989.
   "Capital outflow always afflicts investors as it means
less turnover in the stock market," said James Lin, assistant
manager of Ting Kong Securities Co.
   The market hit a record high at 12495.34 points on Feb. 10
and has since plunged more than 4,400 points, or 36%.
   A slip on the banking sector, in particular for Hua Nan
Commercial Bank, First Commercial Bank and Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank, added to the bearish sentiment.
   Analysts in general see a gloomy outlook for the market.
"With luck, the market will see a rebound here, but it will
again drop anyway," said Dickson Ho, senior analyst with W.I.
Carr (Taiwan) Ltd. "The market trend really looks bearish."
   Tokyo stock prices softened Wednesday in a tug of war
between bargain hunters and profit-takers, with the Nikkei
index finishing lower for the second consecutive day after
fluctuating narrowly on either side of 32000 points.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues closed down 29.42
points at 31967.62. The index fell 45.61 points Tuesday.
Trading lacked energy Wednesday, reflecting the absence of a
clear market focus, participants said.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 83.61 points to
close the morning session at 32051.23.
   On Wednesday, Shigeo Akiba, head of equity trading at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew International, said that following sharp
gains Monday and last Friday, when almost all shares moved
higher, "investors don't know what to do next."
   Prices ended mixed Wednesday as a result of rotational
buying among sectors and among different shares within a
sector, observers said. Sharp gains were noticeable in
certain stocks that appeared to be receiving heavy buying
from speculators' groups. The groups, hit hard by the decline
that began in January, are becoming active players in the
recent recovery of the market, traders said.
   Volume on the First Section was estimated at 750 million
shares, down from 926 million Tuesday. Advancing issues
outnumbered declining issues, 512 to 438, while 185 remained
unchanged.
   The broader-based index ended the day firmer, despite the
decline in the Nikkei. The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of
all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 8.46
points Tuesday, was up 4.99 points, or 0.21%, at 2403.77. The
Second Section index, which added 3.32 points Tuesday, was up
6.60 points, or 0.17%, to close at 3855.38. Volume in the
Second Section was estimated at 16 million shares, down from
18 million Tuesday.
   London shares finished firmer in moderate trading, pushed
higher on technical factors and improved sentiment among
investors about Britain's political and economic climate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 8.9 points at 2221.1, substantially below its intraday
high of 2237.1 and above its early-morning low of 2213.2.
   The narrower FT 30-share index finished up 8.2 points at
1739.8. Volume was 460.6 million shares, better than the
402.4 million that changed hands Tuesday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2258.0, up from 2246.0 Tuesday.
   Sterling's early weakness didn't paint the most promising
picture for gains on the day, dealers said, but bears
covering short positions helped lift the market around
midafternoon. But a weak opening on Wall Street trimmed the
advance, they added.
   Some traders were skeptical about whether stop-loss buying
alone could have boosted the FT-SE 100 index so high, and
suggested that investors are taking a kinder look at the U.K.
stock market following a better-than-expected showing by the
incumbent Conservative Party in recent local government
elections and optimism about the pound's early entry into the
European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism.
   Additionally, one dealer said some fresh buying was
visible. The confluence of positive forces caused prices to
race ahead in an exaggerated upswing, he said.
   A slew of corporate results hit the market with varied
effects. Oil and gas concern Ultramar lost 4 pence (6.7
cents) to 337 after its net profit for the first quarter
tumbled 43%.
   Food and drinks company Grand Metropolitan dove 13 to 574
despite a 36% jump in interim pretax profit. Although coming
in slightly above market forecasts, the results were buoyed
by a large contribution from property disposals.
   Although hit with a first-quarter loss of #25.6 million
($42.9 million), largely on severe weather claims that took a
toll on the rest of the sector, composite insurer Commercial
Union gained 4 to 456 as its earnings topped most market
expectations.
   Elsewhere around the market, pharmaceutical group Glaxo
posted the day's biggest loss, dropping 30 to 783. One dealer
said profit-taking cut into the share price. Additionally, an
unconfirmed report that sales were better than expected for a
competing drug marketed by another company undermined Glaxo's
share price, this dealer added.
   Share prices closed higher in Paris, Amsterdam and Milan;
mixed in Zurich and Brussels and lower in Frankfurt and
Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed firmer.
   Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Wellington; Seoul shares closed higher and Manila shares
finished unchanged.
