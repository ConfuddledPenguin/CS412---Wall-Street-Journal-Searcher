   Your April 17 editorial on dolphins and tuna fish was
misleading and based on incomplete information. The
announcement that StarKist, Bumblebee and Chicken-of-the-Sea
will voluntarily stop buying tuna caught with methods that
harm dolphins is something to cheer about, not disdain.
   Most U.S. tuna fishermen should benefit, not suffer as you
imply, from these changes. One reason will be an increased
demand for tuna from grounds where dolphins are not involved.
Tuna swim with dolphins primarily in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific (ETP). Many U.S. fishermen, especially from small
fisheries on both coasts, already use technologies and
methods unrelated to dolphins. Of the 74 American tuna
purse-seine vessels in the Pacific Ocean in 1988, only 28
fished in the ETP and regularly exploited dolphins.

   Contrary to your assertion of the U.S. fleet's "remarkable
achievements" in saving dolphins, the dolphin kill per U.S.
vessel actually increased threefold in the decade from
1977-88.
   Under the dolphin-safe cannery policies, the U.S. tuna
fleet will not go out of business. Fishermen can adjust as
they proved in 1986 when the fleet exceeded its dolphinkill
quota of 20,500 animals and was forced to abandon temporarily
the exploitation of dolphins for tuna. The U.S. is the
largest consumer of canned tuna -- nearly 55% of the world
market in 1988. Much of this is supplied by foreign fleets
dependent on the U.S. market. As soon as every U.S. processor
sells only dolphin-safe tuna, foreign fishermen will make it
a priority to use dolphin-safe technologies and methods.
