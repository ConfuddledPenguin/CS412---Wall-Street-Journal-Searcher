   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's foreign trade surplus in April
narrowed to a preliminary 2.4 billion kronor ($398.9 million)
from 3.4 billion kronor in March, but widened from a surplus
of 1.6 billion kronor in April 1989, Statistics Sweden, the
national statistics agency, said.
   The latest surplus exceeded the two billion-krona average
prediction of analysts. Exports in April totaled 28.3 billion
kronor, down 4% from a year earlier, and imports amounted to
25.9 billion kronor, down 7%.
