   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany announced twin
programs to subsidize East Germany's industrial
restructuring, including a two-year system of bonuses for
foreign commercial investment beginning July 2, the planned
date for merging the two German economies.
   The unveiling of the subsidy programs came one day after
Bonn and West Germany's 11 states agreed to issue debt for
the creation of a 115 billion mark ($69.99 billion) German
Unity Fund to rescue East Germany's rapidly disintegrating
state economy.

   Suddenly rushing out East German relief programs after
weeks of murky deliberations, Bonn is preparing for the
signing of the state treaty on German monetary and economic
union by the two German finance ministers in Bonn tomorrow.
East Berlin had pressed Bonn to sweeten its offer before
surrendering sovereignty over monetary and fiscal policies to
Bonn as a prelude to reunification.
   Bonn Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann unveiled a
program with an initial allocation of seven billion marks to
fund the modernization of East German state enterprises.
Fearing mass unemployment, East Germany predicts that
two-thirds of its industry desperately needs bridging aid to
survive the shift to a free market following monetary union.
Bonn also is offering to send financial specialists to judge
which East German enterprises are salvageable.
   Mr. Haussmann also proposed a two-year program under which
foreign commercial investments in East Germany would receive
a 12% bonus on their investments in the year ending July 1,
1991, and an 8% bonus in the second year ending July 1, 1992.
   Unlike the industry programs, the German Unity Fund is to
be separate from the federal budget. In furnishing more
details on the 4 1/2-year funding plan, Finance Minister Theo
Waigel said the federal government and the states will share
equally the burden of raising 95 billion marks in the West
German capital markets. The fund will be topped off by a
total contribution of 20 billion marks from federal budget
cuts through 1994.
   The unity fund's assets will go toward covering East
Germany's widening budget deficits, which are expected to
reach about 30 billion marks in the second half of this year
and 50 billion marks in 1991, as the country's skidding
economy lifts the costs of welfare and unemployment programs.
Mr. Waigel said the Bonn government also will craft a
supplementary 1990 budget to transfer three billion marks
into East Germany's welfare budget, a step that could be
repeated next year.
   The unity fund itself will begin transferring funds to
East Germany with a 22 billion-mark allocation this year. The
payouts are to continue with 35 billion marks in 1991, 28
billion marks in 1992, 20 billion marks in 1993 and 10
billion marks in 1994.
   Mr. Waigel said the fund's interest service and principal
will be borne equally by the federal and state governments,
both of which could face interest service reaching 4.75
billion marks a year by 1995. The finance minister said the
debt load could be covered later by the higher tax revenue
expected from a growing pan-German economy.
   Financial markets watched closely as Bonn rolled out its
funding programs this week, looking particularly for details
on the form of the credit-financing for the unity fund. The
Finance Ministry said that details aren't set but that the
funds will be raised in the long-term domestic capital
markets.
   "It would make sense for them to begin issuing longer-term
government debt with 30-year maturities, as many other
governments already do," Steve Major, a bond analyst for
UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in London, said. He observed that Bonn's
debt as a percentage of gross national product is projected
at a low 1.5% this year, with the economy expanding a brisk
4% clip, after accounting for inflation. "The market should
be able to absorb it," he said.
   Analysts said anticipation of a heavy flow of new
government borrowing had been factored into capital-markets
prices and interest rates since January, when the costs of
German unity already began taking on massive proportions.
   Bonn estimates that the combined budget deficits of the
two German nations could swell to 100 billion marks next
year. But so far, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has
excluded tax increases as a funding source.
