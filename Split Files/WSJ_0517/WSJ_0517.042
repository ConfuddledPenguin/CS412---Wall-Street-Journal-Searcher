   LONDON -- Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major,
asserting that "Britain is a pretty convinced European," made
it clear that Margaret Thatcher's government is backing away
from its ideological opposition to a central European banking
authority, and even to a single currency.
   Trying to shed Britain's reputation as combative and
isolated, the soft-spoken, 47-year-old chancellor emphasized
in an interview the need to take concrete steps toward
economic and monetary union, and promised that the Thatcher
government would soon come up with new plans for advancing
these goals.

   Though he didn't provide a date, he insisted that the
United Kingdom is determined to bring the pound into the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The
arrangement links together the major European Community
currencies within set exchange-rate bands. Britain has been
the only major EC member to stand outside the mechanism.
   Mr. Major warned that full EMS membership could be a jolt
both to the U.K. and its partners. He noted that the pound is
a "big currency," the second most widely traded after the
Deutsche mark. If the pound's entry isn't carefully timed, he
warned, it could destabilize other EMS currencies.
   The chancellor also said he would support the further
development of Europe's ECU, the EC's basket currency, and
that he could even imagine the issuance of notes with ECU
value printed on one side and pound value on the other. "I
think there are ways of dealing with a single currency," he
said.
   Mr. Major characterized full monetary union as "a distant
vision in European eyes with no indication of how you
actually get there." But while some British officials have
assailed proposals for a single currency and central EC
banking authority, Mr. Major seemed concerned with
nuts-and-bolts aspects of the transition.
   One tough philosophical dilemma Mr. Major says will
preoccupy EC leaders is the degree of independence of a
future central banking authority, currently dubbed the
"EuroFed." Asked Mr. Major: "If the EuroFed is accountable,
how could it be independent? If it is independent, how will
it be accountable?"
   Speaking of Britain's monetary system, he indicated that a
proposal to make the Bank of England more independent is "not
a live issue at the moment." He continued: "In the United
Kingdom, the monetary authority is effectively the chancellor
of the exchequer and not the central bank." Mr. Major's
predecessor, Nigel Lawson, had suggested that Britain embrace
a more-independent central bank, along the lines of the U.S.
Federal Reserve or the West German Bundesbank.
