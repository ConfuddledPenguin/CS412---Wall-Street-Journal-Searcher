   DEERE &amp; Co. (Moline, Ill.) -- Robert A. Hanson,
65-year-old chairman of this maker of farm and industrial
equipment, will retire, effective June 1, but will remain a
director. Deere said a successor will be elected at a regular
board meeting scheduled for May 30. Hans W. Becherer, 55, who
was president, succeeded Mr. Hanson as chief executive
