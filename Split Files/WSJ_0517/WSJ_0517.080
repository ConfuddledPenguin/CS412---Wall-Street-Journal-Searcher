   A Soviet circus troupe has chosen to remain in a motel in
Atlanta, rather than go back to the Soviet Union. Members of
the Great Circus Bim Bom ran out of money shortly after
starting their U.S. tour, but have turned down an offer of
tickets home. Businessman Steven Leber says they "would
rather be here making no money." We guess this means that
even zero dollars are still worth more than perestroika's
rubles.
