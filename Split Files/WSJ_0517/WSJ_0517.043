   KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Upjohn Co. said it is negotiating to
sell one of its two South African plants to a group of that
plant's management.
   The announcement came during the pharmaceutical company's
annual meeting in which shareholders defeated a proposal that
would have required the company to halt all South African
operations. The proposal was made by three of Upjohn's
institutional investors -- the New York State Retirement
Fund, the New York State Teachers' Retirement System and the
State of Florida.

   Upjohn officials said they're currently holding talks to
sell the Asgrow S.A. vegetable and agronomic seed plant in
South Africa. Upjohn said it hopes to strike a deal by the
end of the second quarter, although required U.S. government
approval may delay the process.
   Upjohn officials said they are selling the plant because
of its weak financial performance. However, they said they'll
only sell the plant to buyers who guarantee to "remain
committed to social programs." Upjohn said the plant now
employs 100 workers.
   Upjohn said it has no plans to sell or close its
pharmaceutical plant in South Africa.
