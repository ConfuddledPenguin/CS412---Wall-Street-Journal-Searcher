   First-quarter group operating profit at Deutsche Bank AG,
West Germany's largest banking company, climbed 24% and the
parent bank's operating earnings rose 20%, Chairman Hilmar
Kopper said at the annual meeting in Essen.
   Partial operating profit, excluding earnings from trading
for the concern's own account, climbed 16% in the group and
14% in the parent bank, Mr. Kopper said. He didn't provide
specific figures.

   "The demand for credit at our domestic and foreign
branches and subsidiaries progressed at a lively rate," Mr.
Kopper said. He said that with "stable interest rate
margins," the parent bank's interest income climbed 8.6%,
boosted by a 9.7% rise in business volume.
   In contrast to several other West German banks, Deutsche
Bank's conservative funding structure, in which it financed
long-term lending activities with long-term funds, made the
bank less vulnerable to the February rise in German interest
rates on fears that monetary union with East Germany would
damage the West German economy and ignite inflation.
