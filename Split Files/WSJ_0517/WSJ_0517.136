   ICH Corp. said it expects to report a profit for the first
quarter compared with a net loss of $10.7 million, or 37
cents a share, a year earlier.
   The Louisville, Ky.-based insurance holding company said
release of first-quarter results has been delayed because the
company didn't receive financial statements in time from
First Executive Corp., in which ICH has about a 20% stake, or
from the purchaser of Philadelphia Life and the Denver
subsidiaries that ICH sold at the end of the first quarter.

   ICH said it can't be certain that its outlook is accurate
until it has fully reviewed that financial information.
   The company said health-insurance operations "have had
improved levels of policy renewals at rates that have
resulted in a somewhat improved ratio of losses to premiums.
As a result, those operations achieved higher revenues and
improved margins, and are ahead of our internal expectations
for this year."
   In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, ICH closed at $3.375, unchanged.
