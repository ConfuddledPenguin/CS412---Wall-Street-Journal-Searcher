   PARIS -- French gross domestic product grew 1% in the
fourth quarter, following a 0.6% rate of expansion in the
third quarter, the National Statistics Institute said.
   For all of 1989, GDP was up 4%, higher than the 3.7%
growth rate previously estimated by Economy Minister Pierre
Beregovoy. The latest figures revise the GDP numbers
published in February, which showed a growth rate of 1.1% in
the fourth quarter and 0.4% in the third quarter. The
statistics agency said the latest figures take into account
definitive results for fourth-quarter industrial production,
which weren't available in February.
