   TOKYO -- The Mitsubishi industrial group and Daimler-Benz
AG of West Germany are picking up the pace of their
discussions on global industrial cooperation.
   A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors Corp. confirmed that
Daimler has contacted Mitsubishi Corp., the trading company
at the core of the Japanese conglomerate, about jointly
building a large auto plant in the Soviet Union.

   But the spokesman said that the talks were in the early
stages and that Mitsubishi hadn't any intention of producing
its own cars in the Soviet Union. "This is a subject to be
discussed in the future," he said. The Japanese press also
reported that the two companies are talking about producing
trucks in East Germany, but the Mitsubishi Motors spokesman
denied that any talks about such a project are under way.
   Mitsubishi Motors and Daimler also have agreed to research
jointly pollution-control devices for autos, the spokesman
said. But he played down the project's significance, saying
only that the two companies may exchange engineers.
   In March, the two concerns made headlines when they agreed
to discuss the prospect of cooperating in a range of
industries, including autos, aerospace and semiconductors.
Last month, Daimler and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
agreed to conduct joint aerospace research.
   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors confirmed it is looking into
the possibility of a joint venture with Chrysler Corp. in
Europe to produce autos. But the company said this is only
one of several possible ventures it is exploring with other
companies, including Volvo AB of Sweden and Renault of
France. Mitsubishi would be the last of the major Japanese
auto makers to establish a production base in Europe, and
many analysts expect the company to announce a venture later
this year.
   Daimler is said to be mapping out plans for growth ahead
of the scheduled unification of markets by the end of 1992 by
members of the European Community, and cooperation with the
Mitsubishi group could be part of these plans.
