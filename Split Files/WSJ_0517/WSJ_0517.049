   William C. Coleman will always be known for the little arc
lamp, which he introduced in 1903 to light rural homes
without electricity. By now Coleman Co. lanterns -- more than
40 million of them -- have illuminated everything from
football fields and family campsites to rescue boats,
barbecues and Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole.
   As Coleman became a fortress in the market for lamps and
lanterns, the Wichita, Kan., company tried to transfer its
reputation to other businesses. In doing so, Coleman has
shown the strengths -- as well as the limits -- of a fortress
image when a company expands.
   "The continued extension of the Coleman name has worked
very well in building the company," says Coleman President
Lawrence Jones. But even with a name as revered as Coleman's,
he adds, "You've got to recognize that in some markets you
haven't earned the credibility that you have in your basic
business."
   Coleman's basic business began just before the turn of the
century, when "W.C.," as Mr. Coleman was called, saw a
gas-powered lamp in an Alabama drugstore. A school teacher
and part-time typewriter salesman, Mr. Coleman contacted the
lamp's manufacturer and later struck a deal to lease the
lights to merchants.
   After Mr. Coleman died in 1957, his son Sheldon greatly
accelerated Coleman's expansion. Annual sales tripled in the
1960s to $134 million and more than doubled in the 1970s to
$300 million. By the time Sheldon Coleman died in 1988, sales
had doubled again, to $657.9 million a year.
   Over the years, Coleman occasionally ventured into areas
where its reputation seemed irrelevant. In doing so, the
company sometimes found it strayed too far.
   Largely with the steady cash flow from its core camping
products, Coleman purchased companies so distant from its
traditional businesses that replacing their brands with
Coleman's didn't make sense. Among its numerous acquisitions:
Hobie Cat sailboats, MasterCraft ski boats, O'Brien
windsurfers and skis, Crossman air guns, Golden Eagle archery
equipment and Dixon riding mowers.
   But Coleman has since decided to unload many of the
companies it bought. Since 1987, it either sold or offered
for sale 11 units that once represented nearly half of
Coleman's annual sales.
   Some of the selling is aimed at paying down debt from
financier Ronald Perelman's $545 million buy-out of the
family-controlled company last April; Coleman now is a unit
of MacAndrew &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which Mr. Perelman
controls. But much of the selling was already planned before
the buy-out. Some of the companies were losing money or had
stopped growing. Others simply didn't fit with Coleman's
expertise.
   In the case of Hobie Cat, Coleman found that a reputation
for lanterns and camp stoves did little to sell sailboats. In
addition, the boats had to be sold through specialty
retailers far removed from Coleman's experience. Hobie had a
loss of $1.7 million in 1988, the year Coleman sold it. Says
a Coleman spokesman: "We want to focus on those things that
Coleman knows and does best."
   When Coleman stayed close to its camp, its expansion often
was hugely successful. The company's folding stoves, coolers
and jugs all became leaders in their fields. So did the
Coleman camping trailer, despite its false start.
   Early models of the folding trailer were defective,
because the lifting mechanism wouldn't raise the tent. The
ensuing product recall might have wrecked another company's
attempt to break into a new market. But Randy Ketelsen, a
camping-trailer dealer in Denver, says the company's
reputation for "uncompromising quality," plus its decision to
replace such traditional construction materials as wood and
cotton canvas with aluminum and rot-resistant synthetic
fabric, helped the company persevere.
   While Coleman recently sold its trailer unit to
mobile-home maker Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. in order to
focus on other lines, Mr. Ketelsen says the trailer operation
represented "the dominant trailer in the industry in the
decade of the 80s."
   By combining Coleman's red-and-white logo with technically
advanced materials, Coleman quickly established itself in the
canoe market as well. A Grumman Corp. unit that makes
aluminum canoes used to dominate the business, until Coleman
emerged with a polyethylene boat that was stronger and half
as expensive. "They went from a standing start to No. 1 in a
few years," says Dennis Hudson, a vice president at George K.
Baum &amp; Co., a Kansas City, Mo., investment bank.
   While Mr. Jones describes Coleman's primary customer as
"high blue collar," Coleman on occasion has managed to place
its name in more-upscale fields. In doing so, it tried
carefully to distinguish these products from other Coleman
goods. In backpacking gear, the company created a special
Peak One label and placed it above the Coleman name. It also
decided to sell the gear in specialty hiking shops, rather
than in the general-interest sporting goods or
mass-merchandise stores where its products usually are found.
   Today, Coleman is considered a leader in certain lines of
backpacking gear. "When they came out with their compact
lantern, it established a whole new product niche," says
David Getchell, equipment editor of Backpacker magazine. In a
recent Backpacker comparison of such products, he says, "the
Coleman stoves finished at or near the top."
