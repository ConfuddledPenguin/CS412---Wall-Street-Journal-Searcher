   Lotus Development Corp. and Novell Inc. extended merger
negotiations amid speculation that Lotus is under pressure to
give Novell a larger role in the management of the proposed
computer-software combination.
   Analysts and major Novell shareholders predicted that the
merger terms will be revised to give more authority to
Raymond Noorda, Novell's chairman, and to other top Novell
managers. Lotus has agreed to acquire Novell for Lotus shares
worth about $1.41 billion at current market prices.

   The companies extended until Friday a letter of intent,
under which definitive terms of the merger are being
negotiated. The letter's original expiry date was Tuesday.
   Lotus, of Cambridge, Mass., and Novell, based in Provo,
Utah, declined to say what remained to be negotiated, but
said that share-exchange terms aren't under discussion. Lotus
is proposing to exchange 1.19131 of its shares for every
Novell share.
   At least part of the delay is related to dissatisfaction
among Novell holders about the terms of the deal, including
the proposed responsibilities of Mr. Noorda, regarded as an
astute builder of Novell's business. Under the announced
terms, Mr. Noorda will be vice chairman of the combined
entity, while Lotus's Jim P. Manzi would remain as chairman,
chief executive and president.
   "I think that Ray Noorda will become co-CEO and more than
vice chairman," under the final terms of the deal, said Fred
Cohen, an analyst at Labe, Simpson &amp; Co. in New York.
   "There's certainly been some disgruntlement among Novell
holders," said Walter Price, a portfolio manager for RCM
Capital Managment, of San Francisco, holder of 2.2 million of
Novell's 33 million shares. "It's important to Novell
shareholders that (Mr. Noorda) have more of a role."
   Mr. Price said he believed Mr. Noorda's responsibilities,
and the roles and incentives for a "layer of people under
him" are under discussion by Lotus and Novell. He and other
Novell holders said they were concerned that Lotus and Mr.
Manzi won't give enough autonomy to Novell, whose business
and customer base are different from Lotus's
personal-computer software.
   "People are afraid Novell will get sucked into Lotus, and
that will be the end of it," said Valerie Malter, an analyst
at Chancellor Capital, in New York. Ms. Malter said
Chancellor's holdings were greater than the 666,000 shares
listed in its latest disclosure statement.
   Novell shareholders have also been concerned "about what
the proper valuation is," said Marty Hurwitz, who follows
Novell for IDS Financial Corp., a big mutual fund manager in
Minneapolis. Mr. Hurwitz declined to discuss IDS's current
stake in Novell, which was 1,070,600 shares at the end of
last year.
   Mr. Cohen of Labe Simpson figures that Lotus should be
giving 1.25 of its shares for each Novell share, but Ms.
Malter said she "would be very surprised to see any change"
in price.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether the concerns of Novell
holders would be enough to block the merger as currently
agreed. Messrs. Price and Hurwitz and Ms. Malter declined to
say how their institutions would vote. The merger is subject
to the approval of both companies' shareholders.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Lotus
closed at $34.50, up 50 cents, and Novell closed at $40, up
50 cents.
