   WASHINGTON -- President Bush stepped up pressure on
Congress to expedite aid to Nicaragua, as House and Senate
negotiators loaded the legislation with bids for new domestic
appropriations.
   A revised fiscal 1990 spending bill, introduced by House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, incorporates
tens of millions of dollars in new initiatives that are sure
to invite criticism from an already irritated White House.

   The proposals run the gamut from at least $68 million to
address flooding problems in the South to smaller but
controversial provisions challenging the authority of
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and earmarking defense funds
for favored projects in the home states of influential
members.
   Mr. Whitten appears bent on reasserting the House's
influence on what has grown into a bill of more than $3.3
billion in the Senate, but as lawmakers pile on, the
Mississippi Democrat and his committee colleagues expose
themselves to reproach.
   In a private meeting Tuesday, the president personally
asked the chairman to expedite the bill, and yesterday, the
White House and GOP allies took a more public route, warning
that the continued delays were endangering the new Chamorro
government by withholding aid.
   The bill promises $300 million in economic assistance for
Nicaragua, as part of a larger foreign-aid package that
includes $420 million for Panama. Mr. Bush reminded Congress
that he initially asked for approval of both items last
month. But the importance of the bill has made it an
attractive vehicle for lawmakers and the president's own
cabinet members, who have lobbied behind the scenes for
supplemental funds to carry their departments through the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   Mr. Bush accused appropriators of having tripled the cost
of his initial request, but the largest single item of more
than $1 billion is to cover what the Agriculture Department
estimates is a shortfall in food-stamp funding. Other major
items include $110 million for the current census and almost
$196 million for child vaccine and preschool education
programs -- much of which is backed by the administration.
And separately, the White House has indulged in its own brand
of pork-barrel politics to buy leverage for itself in the
Senate.
   Still more Pentagon cuts are expected to be needed to
offset added costs, and the military accounts are the focus
of some of the most intensive bargaining. The revised House
bill rescinds $238 million for a Louisiana explosives plant
and anticipates the closing of a second Mississippi
ammunition facility. But the measure also inserts language
sought by Mr. Whitten for a Pentagon-supported academic
center in his home state and includes new provisions for
defense subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), to
transfer military land and earmark at least $5 million in
funds for research facilities in Pennsylvania.
   The negotiations are to continue this morning. But even if
an agreement is reached on the spending bill, the
administration still needs legislative waivers and
authorizations before the Central American funds can be
distributed. The president sought to focus attention on
Nicaragua's plight and the delayed appropriations process,
but his greater political problem lies with the accompanying
authorizing bill and amendments seeking to impose conditions
on military aid to El Salvador.
   Efforts to separate the two issues have so far failed, and
as peace talks began this week on the Salvadoran war, Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) has joined Democratic efforts to
put pressure on the El Salvador government to negotiate. The
first test will come in the House, and though Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) has signaled a willingness to move toward
the administration, there is pressure to reach some
resolution before the Nicaragua and Panama money is released.
   Amid the extraordinary mix of accounts in the supplemental
bill, one policy priority in the negotiations has been the
popular Head Start program to assist poor, preschool-age
children. The House-Senate conference tentatively agreed last
night to add $165.7 million for this fiscal year, an 11%
increase that would bring the program up to its fully
authorized level of $1.55 billion.
   The action came as the House separately approved a $2.4
billion Head Start authorization for the fiscal year
beginning next Oct. 1, but few expect spending to reach that
level, given the pressure of deficit-reduction negotiations.
