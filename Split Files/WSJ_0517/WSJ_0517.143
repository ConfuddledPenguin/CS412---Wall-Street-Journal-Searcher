   Chrysler Corp. said it plans to spend about $150 million
to expand its Kokomo, Ind., transmission plant to prepare for
assembly of a new electronic four-speed automatic
transmission for the 1993 model year.
   The expenditure is part of $190 million in plant
improvement the No. 3 auto maker announced yesterday.
Chrysler also said it will spend about $28 million for new
equipment at its New Castle, Ind., machining and forge plant,
and about $12 million on new tooling for its Kokomo casting
plant.

   Chrysler said production of the new transmission -- a
derivative of a relatively new four-speed automatic
transmission currently used on many of its front-wheel drive
cars -- is scheduled to begin in May 1992. Construction for
the transmission plant expansion will begin this month and
end in February 1991. The Highland Park, Mich., auto maker
said it plans to continue building the six other
transmissions it now makes at the Kokomo facility.
