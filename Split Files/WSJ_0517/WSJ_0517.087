   New York State's legislature appears ready to approve a
package that includes $1.4 billion in new taxes, and delays a
$400 million personal income tax cut.
   The package doesn't include an earlier controversial
proposal to tax advertising, accounting and other services.
That plan, which had been tentatively approved by legislative
leaders, would have generated about $380 million in new tax
revenue.

   The tax package includes new taxes on liquor, cigarettes,
hotel rooms costing more than $100 a night, and cleaning and
security services. There would also be a 15% surcharge on
corporate taxes.
   State Senate and Assembly leaders hashed out the final
elements of the tax plan late Tuesday, a full six weeks after
the April 1 deadline for reaching a budget accord.
   Still to be decided is the crucial school aid component to
the budget, as well as a Senate proposal for a cap on
spending. Legislators have said they hope to have a final
version of the $50 billion budget prepared by the end of the
week.
   State officials have said the delay has cost
municipalities tens of millions of dollars in short-term
borrowing costs. The annual budget battle usually is a
contentious three-way affair, pitting upstate Republicans,
downstate Democrats and Gov. Mario Cuomo against one another.
As in past years, each side has blamed the others for the
delays.
