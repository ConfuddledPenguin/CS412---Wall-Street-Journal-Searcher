   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., which has been struggling
to avoid bankruptcy, reported significantly wider losses and
lower revenue for the first quarter.
   The company had a loss of $18.1 million compared with a
$189,000 deficit in the year-earlier period. If undeclared
dividends on preferred shares are included, the company's net
loss was $29.5 million, or 37 cents a common share, against
$13.5 million, or 32 cents a share, in last year's first
quarter.

   These numbers are based on an average 80.7 million shares
in this year's first quarter because of the continuing
conversion of Western Union's Class B convertible preferred
shares into common, compared with the average 42.6 million
common shares outstanding in last year's quarter.
   Revenue fell 8.2% to $144.7 million from $158.2 million.
   A company spokesman pegged the wider losses to "a
continued steep decline in our telex revenues, higher
interest expenses and higher operating expenses in our
Financial Services unit . . . particularly from higher fees
and commissions paid to agents of our money transfer and bill
payment services."
   Broken down, Business Services revenue from telex,
electronic mail and Mailgram fell 21%, to $66.1 million from
$83.5 million a year ago. This was primarily due to a
"precipitous" drop in telex revenue of about 33% in the
quarter, said the spokesman. But he added that revenue from
electronic mail, which Western is counting on to pick up the
slack, grew 25%. Financial services, including Money
Transfer, voice messaging, telegram and bill payments rose
11% to $7.9 million in the quarter.
   Meanwhile, Western Union's bid, filed last month, to
recapitalize its debt and issue new common stock has yet to
clear the Securities and Exchange Commission, the spokesman
said. The company has said that it may be forced to seek
protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if the plan doesn't
go through.
   Western Union wants to issue new debt securities to
holders of its senior secured reset notes due Dec. 15, 1992,
which currently carry an interest payment of 19.25%, and to
holders of its 16% notes due June 15, 1991. It is also
seeking to reclassify its preferred stock and the Class B
common shares held by its primary owner Brooke Partners
Limited Partnership into new common shares.
   In its quarterly report to the SEC, Western Union said
that if it can't find sufficient funds to make a $51 million
interest payment due June 15 on its reset notes it could be
forced into a default.

   WESTERN UNION Corp.'s financial-services revenue grew 11%
to $78.6 million. The figure was misstated in yesterday's
edition. In addition, the company said it no longer plans to
reclassify the Class B common shares held by Brooke Partners
Limited Partnership into new common shares.
