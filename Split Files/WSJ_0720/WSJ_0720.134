   A federal judge in New York barred Maxus Energy Corp. from
continuing most of its claims against Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
in Texas state court related to Maxus's acquisition of
Natomas Co.
   In a suit filed in Texas, Maxus alleged that it paid more
than it should have in its 1983 acquisition of Natomas
because inside information was passed by former Kidder
investment banker Martin A. Siegel to convicted former stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Maxus, formerly Diamond Shamrock
Corp., sought $1.6 billion in damages.

   Senior U.S. District Judge Milton J. Pollack rebuked
Maxus's lawyers for litigating the same issues in state court
in Dallas that he said he had already decided in Manhattan.
   "Semantic adroitness will not serve to obscure what was
litigated, argued and then decided in this court," Judge
Pollack wrote in the injunction issued late Wednesday.
   Judge Pollack had ruled in April that Maxus, based in
Dallas, hadn't suffered injury during the 1983 Natomas
purchase and wasn't entitled to make claims against Kidder
based on the alleged stock price run-up.
   Judge Pollack's order reversed a ruling by state District
Judge Adolph Canales of Dallas. In that ruling last month,
Judge Canales denied Kidder's request to dismiss most of the
claims. In seeking a dismissal, Kidder had cited the April
ruling by Judge Pollack, which Maxus has appealed. The appeal
is pending.
   Maxus had argued before Judge Canales that Judge Pollack's
order had no effect on its Texas action and that it was "not
clear." Judge Pollack's April order and this week's
injunction don't affect Maxus's efforts in the Texas suit to
recover more than $4 million in fees and expenses it paid to
Kidder in the transaction.
   Gary Naftalis, the lawyer for Kidder, a unit of General
Electric Co., declined to comment. Charles E. Davidow, the
attorney for Mr. Boesky, who would have been required to
testify in the Texas case, said, "Judge Pollack seems to take
the view that once he enters an order, it will be viewed as
binding and not merely a recommendation."
   A Maxus spokeswoman said, "We have already appealed {Judge
Pollack's} earlier ruling and no decisions about further
steps have been made at this point."

   WORKERS MAY NOT BE BOUND by agreements not to sue for age
bias.
   A federal judge in Tampa issued the ruling in a battle
over whether companies can enforce signed statements in which
older employees agree not to sue for civil rights claims or
back wages. Fired employees often waive their legal claims
against a company in exchange for higher severance pay.
   But Judge William Castagna ruled that the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act makes the waivers
unenforceable unless the severance agreement is supervised by
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a federal
court.
   Many other courts have enforced unsupervised waivers if
the waiver was found to be "knowing and voluntary." Judge
Castagna rejected that standard, arguing that "unsupervised
waivers of ADEA claims are contrary to the intent of the
Congress that passed the ADEA." He said Congress repeatedly
has suspended EEOC regulations permitting employers to obtain
waivers without supervision.
   The case involves more than 100 workers fired by
Brown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky., in November 1986.
William Gormin, the plaintiff who initially filed the suit,
alleges he was fired as part of the company's policy to force
older employees to retire early "despite their
qualifications, ability and willingness to work" and to
replace them with younger workers.
   Brown-Forman asked Judge Castagna to dismiss the case
because the lead plaintiff had signed a release of all claims
when he accepted $56,000 in severance pay. But the judge
refused, saying that when older workers sign waivers as part
of a severance agreement, they face "little more than a
Hobson's choice," with no real alternative.
   Ed Fessenden, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said
the judge's decision effectively blocks Brown-Forman's
efforts to avoid a trial. Lawyers for Brown-Forman refused to
comment on the case.

   LICENSING COMPANY allowed to pursue controversial patent
suit.
   Refac International Ltd. sued six major software companies
in 1989 after buying a 5% stake in a patent allegedly used in
spreadsheet software. But last May, Judge Michael Mukasey in
federal court in Manhattan ruled that the suit would be
thrown out because of Refac's licensing agreement. The judge
said the licensing arrangement violated New York state law
against champerty, which occurs when someone helps pay the
cost of someone else's suit in exchange for a share of any
proceeds.
   To comply with the judge's ruling, Refac, a subsidiary of
Refac Technology Development Corp., said Forward Reference
Systems Ltd. has joined as a plaintiff in the suit. The
Canadian company owns the remaining 95% of the patent. The
judge had said Refac was illegally acting as the surrogate
for Forward Reference Systems.
   Eugene Lang, president of Refac Technology, said the
company also has moved to drop its claims against all but one
of the defendants, Lotus Development Corp.
   Mr. Lang said he disagreed with Judge Mukasey's ruling
that Refac had bought a stake in the patent for the purpose
of pursuing litigation. "Our purpose is to license, not to
litigate," he said.
   Henry Gutman, an attorney for Lotus, said the allegations
of patent infringement were "entirely without merit." He said
the company is exploring whether Refac's role in the case is
still illegal despite the change in plaintiffs.

   EX-CITIBANK EXECUTIVE sentenced to eight years for
stealing $25 million.
   Mario Rios Pinochet, formerly a vice president in charge
of safeguarding assets at Citibank, was convicted in May of
embezzling five bearer securities valued at $5 million each.
Prosecutors accused Mr. Pinochet, 48, of taking the
securities on Jan. 25 while inspecting a vault in Manhattan
as part of an effort to improve security procedures at
Citibank, a unit of Citicorp.
   At the sentencing before Judge Robert J. Ward in federal
court in Manhattan, Mr. Pinochet strongly denied any
wrongdoing and said he would appeal. He also told the judge
that the securities he allegedly took had no market value.
   Judge Ward rejected Mr. Pinochet's request to be released
on bail pending appeal, citing the possibility that Mr.
Pinochet, who has family in Chile and other countries, might
flee the U.S. One of the five securities taken from the vault
is still missing.
   The judge ordered Mr. Pinochet to make restitution of as
much as $5 million to Citibank if the bank makes payments on
the security during Mr. Pinochet's sentence.

   FORMER TEXAS THRIFT OWNER Edwin T. McBirney III pleaded
innocent to charges that he defrauded the defunct Sunbelt
Savings Association of Texas. Mr. McBirney was indicted last
week by a federal grand jury in Dallas on 17 charges related
to allegedly fraudulent loan transactions at Sunbelt Savings.
He is scheduled for trial on Sept. 4 before U.S. District
Judge Robert B. Maloney of Dallas.
