   SANDWICH CO-OPERATIVE BANK, Sandwich, Mass., reduced its
quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 15 cents. The
new dividend is payable Aug. 14 to stock of record July 31.
Sandwich said that "given the current real estate market and
economic forecast, it is prudent to conserve capital." The
bank said that its capital-to-assets ratio is a strong 13.4%.
