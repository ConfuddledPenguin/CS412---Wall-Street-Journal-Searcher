   HOUSTON -- American General Corp., which earlier this year
defeated a hostile takeover bid by Torchmark Corp., reported
higher second-quarter earnings; these earnings, the company
says, indicate that it was correct in arguing that
Torchmark's $50-a-share bid was too low.
   For the second quarter, the insurance company reported net
income rose to $198 million, or $1.65 a share, compared with
profit from continuing operations of $103.4 million, or 82
cents a share. Net income in the year-ago quarter was $190
million, or $1.47 a share. After-tax operating earnings,
excluding realized investment gains, rose about 19%, to
$117.5 million, or 98 cents a share, from $98.4 million, or
78 cents a share. Revenue rose to $1.2 billion, from $1.05
billion.

   "Clearly our earnings substantiate what we have been
saying about the underlying earning power of the company,
which we feel exceeds the value" of Torchmark's offer, said
James D'Agostino Jr., American General vice president and
treasurer.
   For the six months, the company reported net income of
$305.1 million, or $2.55 a share, compared with income from
continuing operations of $200.6 million, or $1.59 a share.
For the 1989 six months, the company reported net income of
$287.2 million, or $2.24 a share. Revenue increased to $2.24
billion, from $2.06 billion.
   The company, which also said it has been approached by a
number of domestic and international companies interested in
buying American General, has started providing due diligence
information to at least one interested party. Although
American General beat back an effort by Torchmark to place
its own nominees on American's board of directors in May, the
company announced at its annual meeting that it was placing
itself on the block anyway.
