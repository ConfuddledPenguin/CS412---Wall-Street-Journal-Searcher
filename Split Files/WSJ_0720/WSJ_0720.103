   NEW YORK -- Stock prices fell sharply at first, as
investors fretted about corporate earnings disappointments,
then bounced back with help from program trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average squeezed out a
12.13-point gain in the last hour of trading, closing at
2993.81 in moderately active trading. The average had been
down 22 points in the morning.

   Bond prices drifted slightly lower in light trading, and
the dollar ended mixed. Both bond and currency markets were
languishing in the aftereffects of Wednesday's
worse-than-expected inflation news and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's murky comments about monetary
policy.
   In the stock market, prices fell through much of the day,
led by a rout in technology stocks that was sparked by
disappointing earnings news. Many of the same issues later
retraced part of their lost ground, followed by a rally in
oil stocks stemming from news that less petroleum will flow
through the Alaskan pipeline.
   Near the end of the session, program traders swooped in to
buy the stocks in the Major Market Index, which mimics the
Dow Jones industrials.
   Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First
Securities, said the price of the MMI futures contract that
expires today on the Chicago Board of Trade rose to a premium
big enough to prompt program traders to sell the futures and
buy the 20 underlying stocks, 17 of which are also in the Dow
Jones industrials.
   Today's expiration of the MMI contract could cause erratic
stock market action, cautioned Robert S. Robbins, market
strategist at Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta. Added Donald
Selkin, head of stock-index research at Prudential-Bache
Securities: "Fasten your seat belts."
   Bond investors were still digesting the spate of economic
news Wednesday, said John Slosberg, senior fixed-income
analyst at Thompson Financial Networks, Boston. "The market
was suffering sort of a hangover from the previous day's
steep drop," he said, adding that inflation has reemerged as
a major concern.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 162 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 858 to 621.
   Bond prices eased less than an eighth of a point, or less
than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.55%.
   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6410 marks and 148.10 yen, compared
with 1.6480 marks and 147.75 yen Wednesday.
