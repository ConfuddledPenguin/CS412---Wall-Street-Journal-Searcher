   Schering-Plough Corp. posted a 20% profit gain for the
second quarter, and Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. reported a 46%
drop in net income because of a gain in the year-earlier
period.
   Schering-Plough, Madison, N.J., said net increased to
$144.1 million, or 64 cents a share, from $120.5 million, or
53 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $864
million from $805.5 million.

   The company said the biggest reason for the gain was
growth in its pharmaceutical business in the U.S. and
overseas. If not for a 1989 divestiture of a majority stake
in a Brazilian venture, pharmaceutical sales would have
increased 18% in the quarter, the company said.
   Schering-Plough's Maybelline cosmetic business did poorly,
although the company noted that business was sold this month.
In addition, sales of health care products declined 8% in the
quarter. Still, the company said its total sales would have
increased 12% in the quarter if not for the Brazilian
divestiture and the sale last year of the company's European
cosmetics operations.
   In the first half, the company said net rose 20% to $294.5
million, or $1.30 a share, from $246.2 million, or $1.09 a
share, as sales increased 6% to $1.73 billion from $1.64
billion. The company reiterated its prediction that per-share
earnings for the year will grow by 18% to 20%.
   At Becton Dickinson, net declined in its third quarter,
ended June 30, to $46.7 million, or $1.20 a share, from $86.4
million, or $2.19 a share. But that drop occurred solely
because the year-earlier period included a substantial gain
on the sale of an industrial glove business. If not for that
gain and the profit from those operations in the year-earlier
period, profit in the latest quarter would have been up 20%.
Sales rose 12% to $496.6 million from $442.8 million.
   Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J., said the results
show that its operating margins are improving and that sales
growth is increasing. It said that international sales
growth, at 18%, was especially strong in the quarter.
   In the nine months, net dropped 25% to $120 million, or
$3.07 a share, from $159.1 million, or $4 a share. Earnings
would have risen 16% without the profit and gain from
discontinued operations in the year-earlier period. Sales
climbed 10% to $1.45 billion from $1.31 billion.
   The strong results continue a recent string of impressive
reports from drug makers.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Schering-Plough shares slipped 25 cents to $49.875, while
Becton Dickinson stock climbed 87.5 cents to $74.
