   LOS ANGELES -- NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd.
announced several senior executive changes, including staff
cuts, in its Nelson Entertainment Group as part of its
previously announced restructuring plan to focus on making
and marketing movies.
   The company's shares fell 75 cents to $4.375 in composite
trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange.

   The company issued a statement saying it believed the
staff cuts had been "misinterpreted."
   Nelson said it decided to consolidate its international
sales and marketing operations in its London office. Massimo
Graziosi was named president and chief operating officer of
the group's Nelson Entertainment International, a sales and
marketing arm. He was formerly senior vice president of the
unit.
   He succeeds Ian Jessel, who held the same title but at
Nelson's offices in Los Angeles. The company said Mr. Jessel
resigned after learning that Nelson planned to move the
operations to London. Nelson also said that Ian Scorer,
executive vice president of Nelson Entertainment
International in London, also resigned. Messrs. Jessel and
Scorer couldn't be reached for comment.
   The company also said that Steve Sohmer resigned as
president of Nelson Television, another unit of Nelson
Entertainment Group. The company said it will de-emphasize
its operations in television development and production.
   Nelson Entertainment Group is one of a dwindling number of
independent movie producers. The company co-produced the
highly successful "When Harry Met Sally" and released "Bill
and Ted's Excellent Adventure." The company has seven movies
in the pipeline including "The Taking of Beverly Hills," a
movie in which all the homes and stores in Beverly Hills are
robbed.
   Analysts note that the executive changes and the
restructuring follow the company's loss in the first quarter,
reflecting a dearth of releases. "The company is trying to
recapitalize its financial balance sheet and this is a
good-faith effort to lower the overhead as much as they can,"
said Jeff Logsdon, senior vice president of Seidler Amdec
Securities in Los Angeles.
   NHI Holdings also holds a 69% stake Nelson Vending
Technology. In the first quarter of this year, NHI Holdings
reported a net loss of $3.2 million on revenues of $18.9
million, compared with a net loss of $4.8 million on revenues
of $16.3 million in the year-earlier quarter.
