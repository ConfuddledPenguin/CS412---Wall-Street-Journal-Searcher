   MILPITAS, Calif. -- LSI Logic Corp., in the latest move
toward ever-cheaper workstations, unveiled a set of chips
that will let computer makers clone workstations based on
Mips Computer Systems Inc.'s popular computer architecture.
   The "chip set," called Mipset, could spark a proliferation
of inexpensive Unix workstation clones, much as earlier chip
sets helped computer makers in the mid-1980s clone
International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computers
from off-the-shelf parts. "It's an important first step
toward lowering the barrier to entering the workstation
market," said Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor
Report, a newsletter.

   The new chip set also places LSI Logic in a unique
position to tap the booming market for workstations, powerful
desktop machines used most often by engineers but
increasingly popular for business applications as their
prices fall to compete with personal computers. LSI Logic
already makes a chip set for clones of Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s machines, which, along with Mips-architecture
machines, hold the lion's share of the market for
workstations using reduced-instruction-set computing, or
Risc, technology.
   The LSI Logic chip set squeezes into five chips the
circuits that normally occupy more than 40 chips in
conventional Mips machines. The chip set would allow a
manufacturer to build a workstation without spending the time
and money to design it from scratch.
   "All they need to do is put a box around it, add a screen
and a keyboard, and they're in business," said Keisuke
Yawata, president of LSI Logic's Japanese subsidiary, which
designed the chip set and manufactures it in Japan.
   One of the first users of the chips will be Japan's
Brother Industries Ltd., which is building a laptop
workstation without any prior experience in making computers.
Four other Japanese and U.S. companies plan to build the
chips into laser printers and computers, Mr. Yawata said.
Japanese engineers designed the chip in Japan to help attract
buyers among Japanese electronics companies, which are more
comfortable with chips produced in that country, he said.
   LSI Logic said it will begin shipping immediately samples
of its Mipset and will produce mass quantities by the year's
end. The chips are available in two versions, a $704 version
operating at 16 million and a $1,097 set running at 20
million instructions per second, LSI Logic said.
   The new chip set is also important to Mips, which has
licensed a broad range of companies to make and use its chips
as part of its battle against Sun and others to establish the
Mips chip as a de facto standard for Unix workstations. Sun
is also in the unlikely position of encouraging clones of its
machines in order to woo computer users into its camp.
   LSI Logic gets the best of both worlds as the only big
maker to produce both Sun and Mips chips under license. "From
their point of view, it's an awfully comfortable position,"
said Mr. Slater. Still, he said, the financial success of LSI
Logic's chip sets depends on its customers' ability to eat
into the personal computer market, which is much larger than
the Unix workstation market. "They've got to get onto
mainstream business desktops; that's where the volume is," he
said.
