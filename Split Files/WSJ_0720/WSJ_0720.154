   Earnings of four paper and pulp manufacturers were down
sharply in the second quarter, as price discounting continued
to hurt Champion International Corp., Union Camp Corp. and
Bowater Inc. while heavy acquisition costs wiped out stronger
operating results at Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   The industry generally had been expected to report
substantially lower earnings in the face of price pressures
and production cutbacks. Many newsprint and paper producers
managed to push through 5% increases in listed prices in
June, hoping to offset substantial industry discounting.

   Georgia-Pacific, which began including results of Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. in the first quarter, posted a 38%
drop in earnings as interest expense on the $3.74 billion
acquisition nearly tripled. Net income for the latest quarter
fell to $107 million, or $1.25 a share, from $172 million, or
$1.90 a share. But operating results were stronger. Revenue
increased 33% to $3.52 billion from $2.64 billion.
   The Atlanta-based forest products concern said stronger
operating profit from the building products and pulp and
paper businesses, along with higher prices for softwood
lumber and structural panels, drove total operating profit
10% higher, to $425 million.
   Still, a near-tripling of interest expense in the quarter,
to $185 million, more than offset the operating results.
Georgia-Pacific completed its acquisition of Nekoosa, based
in Norwalk, Conn., in March.
   For the half, Georgia-Pacific's net fell 36% to $208
million, or $2.43 a share, from $326 million, or $3.55 a
share. Sales were up 21% to $6.18 billion. Interest expense,
largely resulting from the Nekoosa acquisition, rose to $282
million from $132 million a year earlier.
   Champion's earnings for the quarter were down 50%, to
$56.5 million, or 61 cents a share, from $113.9 million, or
$1.20 a share. Sales declined 2.2% to $1.26 billion. The
results include a $42.9 million restructuring charge for
modernization at several mills and preferred stock dividend
payments of $6.9 million. But those were largely offset by
$46.7 million in gains from sale or disposal of timber and
fixed assets and resolution of issues related to its merger
with St. Regis Corp. in 1984.
   The Stamford, Conn., company noted continued weak prices
and production volume in newsprint, linerboard and pulp. It
also said earnings were hurt by economic reforms in Brazil,
where Champion has a subsidiary. Those measures include
higher taxes, Chairman Andrew Sigler said. He also said
several rebuilding and expansion projects required lengthy
shutdowns and production delays, but that those problems "are
largely behind us."
   For the six months, net was down 48% to $119.4 million, or
$1.29 a share, from $227.4 million, or $2.39 a share. Sales
were off 1.3% to $2.54 billion. Six-month results also
included the $42.9 million charge and $13.9 million in
preferred dividends, which were largely offset by the gains
on asset disposals and the St. Regis resolution.
   Union Camp earnings were down 28% to $58.4 million from
$81.4 million. Sales were essentially flat at $715 million. A
spokesman said the primary factor was price discounting for
products such as linerboard and uncoated papers, noting that
prices are off significantly from year-earlier levels.
Linerboard is used for corrugated materials and packaging,
and uncoated papers include photocopy paper and business
forms.
   For the six months, earnings were down 22% to $125.8
million, or $1.83 a share. Sales were off slightly at $1.42
billion.
   Gene Cartledge, chairman of Union Camp, based in Wayne,
N.J., said in a statement, "Even though earnings de clined
from last year's record second quarter, demand for our paper
and packaging products was healthy, and our mill operating
rates were good." He said total paper product shipments were
up 4.5% to 716,000 tons.
   The Union Camp spokesman said last year's second quarter
was a peak for uncoated white paper prices, which exaggerated
the recent quarter's decline.
   Bowater said net was down 63% to $14.2 million, or 36
cents a share, from $38 million, or $1.01 a share, including
an extraordinary charge. Sales decreased 5.8% to $342.3
million.
   The Darien, Conn., company, primarily a newsprint
producer, said the $9 million charge, reducing per-share net
by 25 cents, is for costs of retiring about $125 million in
debentures. It said the quarter results also included a gain
of $2.4 million, or seven cents a share, involving employee
benefit costs.
   For the half, net was down 53% to $36.4 million from $76.9
million. For the quarter and half, all of its operating
segments were either flat or down 1.7% to 18.6%. The company
said, however, that it expected improvement in newsprint
prices after a $35-a-ton increase in June and improved
operations after start-up expenses at new pulp mills.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Georgia-Pacific closed at $47.75, down 12.5 cents; Champion
closed at $29.25, up 12.5 cents; Union Camp closed at $38.50,
up 25 cents; and Bowater closed at $23.875, up 12.5 cents.
