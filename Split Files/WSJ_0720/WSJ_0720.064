   PARIS -- Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft
consortium, said it received firm orders from the Romanian
flag carrier Transporturile Aeriene Romane, or Tarom, for
three A-310-300 jets, with deliveries scheduled from March
1992 to February 1993. Terms weren't disclosed but the price
of one of the airliners is estimated at $60 million.
   Each plane will be equipped to seat 209 passengers in a
two-class layout, and will be powered by PW4156A engines made
by the Pratt &amp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp.,
