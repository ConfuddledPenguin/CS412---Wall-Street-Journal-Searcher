   WASHINGTON -- The owner of a large Dallas savings and loan
under investigation by a Senate subcommittee is trying to
sell the thrift, and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum asked regulators
to block any sale until the inquiry has ended.
   A Bluebonnet Savings Bank spokesman said owner James Fail
has been discussing a sale of the institution "for months,"
though no definitive agreement has been reached.

   Sen. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, has held hearings on
the December 1988 sale of 15 insolvent thrifts by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Mr. Fail put up $1,000 of
his own money and borrowed $70 million to take control of the
thrifts. He subsequently merged them to form Bluebonnet,
which has $3 billion in assets. Sen. Metzenbaum has charged
that the government gave Mr. Fail a sweetheart deal. The
senator is looking for ways to renegotiate or repudiate part
of the agreement the government made to guarantee profits on
much of Bluebonnet's bad assets.
   Mr. Metzenbaum also has raised questions about why Mr.
Fail, an Arizona insurance executive, was allowed to buy the
S&amp;Ls despite the fact that one of his companies pleaded
guilty to fraud in Alabama in 1976.
   In a letter to federal thrift regulators released
yesterday, Mr. Metzenbaum said, "I believe that the
government's position with reference to renegotiating its
contract with Bluebonnet would be made more difficult if a
sale were to be made prior to the conclusion of our
investigation."
