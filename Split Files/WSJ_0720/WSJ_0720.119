   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $170.7 billion measure
funding the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and
Human Services for fiscal 1991, after boosting anti-drug
spending by $300 million to quiet "drug czar" William
Bennett.
   The spending bill, approved 359-58, also includes large
increases for medical research and aid to public schools.

   The Appropriations Committee leadership amended the bill
to add $321.4 million for drug treatment and the drug-free
schools program, raising such spending to the levels
requested by the Bush administration. Mr. Bennett got his
money even though several members are still seething that,
according to Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.), he called them "a
bunch of clowns" earlier in the week as he pressed for the
money.
   "If our distinguished drug czar is going to end up
hyperventilating every time he doesn't get what he wants,
then I suggest he go back to smoking cigarettes to calm
down," said Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.).
   The House rejected several attempts to trim the bill,
which is about $17 billion, or 10%, above the 1990 level and
about $3.9 billion over President Bush's request. The total
is almost certain to be pared by the budget summit between
the White House and Congress -- if those talks produce an
agreement. "This is very likely the high water mark," Rep.
Conte said.
   The labor and education measure is the eighth and largest
of the annual domestic spending bills to clear the House.
Attention now turns toward cutting defense spending to offset
proposed increases in domestic spending.
   To that end, the House Appropriations Committee approved
an $8.3 billion military-construction bill, which is 10%
below President Bush's request and significantly pares the
administration's plans for spending overseas. While the
administration sought to spend $153.7 million in Germany, for
instance, the panel approved only $33.2 million. The
committee also amended the bill to bar the Air Force from
moving its Ballistic Missile Organization away from Norton
Air Force Base, Calif.
   In a separate vote, the committee approved a $3.9 billion
District of Columbia spending measure.
   The rush of legislation from the House has increased
pressure on the Senate to act. The Senate Appropriations
Committee yesterday approved the first of its fiscal 1991
measures, a $20.8 billion bill funding energy and water
programs. That is $580 million more than the administration
requested and $2.3 billion above the current year's level,
largely because of added spending to clean up nuclear waste
at defense plants.
   To accommodate individual senators on the committee, the
panel endorsed 11 projects that weren't mentioned in the
subcommittee version of the bill -- including projects in the
home states of Sens. James Sasser (D., Tenn.) and Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.), who are key negotiators at the
deficit-reduction talks.
   The bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers to spend
$550,000 to protect the banks of a park on Lake Barkley in
Clarksville, Tenn. The accompanying report earmarks $400,000
for a study of pollution problems in Nashville if local
opposition prevents the corps from spending that sum on
another Tennessee project. It also earmarks $500,000 for the
Velarde ditch project in New Mexico.
