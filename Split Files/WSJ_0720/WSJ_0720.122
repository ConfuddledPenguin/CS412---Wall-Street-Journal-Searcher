   NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended narrowly mixed in sparse
activity as the market took a breather after Wednesday's
frenetic dealings.
   "We're seeing a consolidation after the steep losses in
bond prices," that occured on Wednesday, said Robert T.
McGee, a senior vice-president at Tokai Bank Ltd.

   "It was a quiet day, there wasn't much trading," adds
David Green, manager of the government bond trading
department at Chemical Bank.
   Bond prices fell a full point on Wednesday, about $10 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount, on concerns about inflation
raised by a stronger-than-expected report on June consumer
prices. Adding to those worries was the bond market's
impression from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that the central bank isn't as
staunch about fighting inflation as it might be.
   In trading yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fluctuated in a narrow band and ended 1/8 point lower, a
loss of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, rose to 8.55% from 8.54% on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, in a repeat of Wednesday's pattern,
shorter-term Treasury securities fared better than
longer-term securities. Prices of Treasury notes maturing in
two to five years ended slightly higher yesterday.
   Some analysts said the weaker performance of longer-term
bonds reflects the bearish outlook that has emerged for
bonds. As a result, investors are getting out of long-term
securities and putting their cash into short-term securities.
   Analysts say rates of short-term securities are likely to
remain relatively stable in the near term following the Fed's
credit easing move last Friday.
   But a variety of factors, including growing jitters about
inflation, perceptions that Congress is being stymied by
partisan politics in its attempt to fashion a federal
budget-reduction accord, and the prospect of a huge amount of
new supply at the August refunding of the federal debt, are
likely to push bond yields considerably higher, they said.
   "It looks like we'll see continued weakness in the long
end of the market and further steepening of the yield curve,"
said David Jones, a senior vice president and economist at
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   The economist refers to the widening gap, or spread,
between yields of shorter-dated and longer-dated issues. As
yields of securities with longer maturities have risen and
those of shorter maturities have edged lower during the past
week, the yield curve has steepened.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond currently yields 0.45 to 0.46
percentage point more than the outstanding two-year note.
That spread is up from 0.17 percentage point about a week
ago.
   "I'm negative on the long end of the market," said Roger
Early, a vice president and portfolio manager at Federated
Investors Inc. "It's hard to be a buyer of bonds," said Mr.
Early, who believes that the yield of the bellwether 30-year
bond could climb to 8.75% by the Treasury's quarterly
refunding in August.
   Details of Uncle Sam's next quarterly sale of three-year,
10-year and 30-year securities are due out Aug. 1. Early
estimates are for a record-sized $31 billion refunding
package.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Long-term Treasury bonds were hurt mainly by fears of
inflation. But investors were also disappointed by news that
the Treasury will issue far more supply in the market than
originally planned.
   The Treasury said it may borrow a net of $62 billion to
$66 billion during the third quarter. In May, the Treasury
had said it was looking to borrow in the range of $30 billion
to $35 billion for the July-September quarter.
   The Treasury said it revised its third-quarter borrowing
needs to include funds slated for the federal government's
rescue of sick thrifts.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
a price of 102 1/32, down slightly from 102 4/32 on
Wednesday. The latest two-year notes were quoted at 100
15/32, up slightly from 100 13/32 on Wednesday. Yields on
two-year notes ended at 8.09%, down from 8.12%.
   Treasury bill rates also were lower. The discount rate on
three-month bills eased slightly to 7.55% yesterday from
7.56% on Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills eased to
7.45% from 7.48%. Bond-equivalent yields were 7.78% on
three-month bills and 7.83% on the six-month bills.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds

   Investor interest in junk bonds picked up slightly late in
the day after a slow start during morning trading. Most junk
bonds, which are speculative-grade bonds that carry low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged
to modestly higher.
   Investment-grade bonds, those with higher credit ratings,
were little changed.
   After three consecutive days, the junk bond euphoria
created by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s $6.9 billion recapitalization
plan faded away and the market returned to the quiet trading
that has characterized most of the month.
   Among gainers, RJR's 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind
debentures due in 2009, which formerly had a rate of 14.07%,
rose 1 3/8 point to 117 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additional
securities.
   The junk bonds of retailers posted gains yesterday due to
prospects of improved earnings. Those prospects were
highlighted by a positive earnings report for Kroger Co. The
grocery chain's 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures picked
up 1/4 point to trade at 105.
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co., which reported that it had worked out a
deal with bank lenders that would give it more financial leg
room during the Christmas season, saw its 14.5% subordinated
debentures trade 1/2 point higher to 62 1/2.
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.'s 12.5% senior subordinated
notes ended the day at 83, up 1/2 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower in
uninspired dealings.
   In related municipal activity, New York City officials
announced the sale of $1.1 billion tax anticipation notes to
be sold via competitive bid July 24.
   Ratings on the issue are under review by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/8 point lower at 99 1/4 to
yield 7.24%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were weaker in most major foreign markets
yesterday.
   British government bonds fell as investors focused on
inflation indicators that appeared in the latest employment
report. The report revealed that wages increased at an annual
rate of 9.75% in May. Although that was similar to the rate
of increase in April, it shows that no progress has been made
on the inflation front.
   Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% bond fell 1/2 point to
101 27/32 to yield 11.47% while the 12% notes due 1995 fell
6/ 32 to 99 21/32 to yield 12.10%.
   Prices of West German and Japanese government bonds also
ended lower yesterday.
   In the Eurobond market, prices ended about 1/4 point
lower. Among new issues, Ford Motor Co. offered $250 million
of 9.5% 10-year notes priced at 99.285.
   The offering received mixed reviews from the group
syndicating the deal. Lead manager Goldman, Sachs
International Ltd., which placed close to $100 million of the
issue, reported healthy interest from European and British
accounts.
   Officials at two of the other banks involved with the
offering reported demand ranging from steady to good. Some
other members, however, said they had found difficulty
garnering enough interest for the issue as they found
investors still fixated with shorter-term securities.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices ended unchanged to
marginally lower.
   Among 9.5% securities for August delivery, Government
National Mortgage Association issues were off 1/32 at 99 5/8,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. were down 3/ 32 at 98 29/32
and Federal National Mortgage Association issues were lower
by 3/32 at 99 13/32.
   In the subdued primary market, Salomon Brothers Inc.
announced details of a Salomon Brothers Mortgage Securities
VII Inc. issue of real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities totaling around $94 million.
   Collateral for the deal is 15-year and 30-year
conventional jumbo whole loans that are being serviced by PHH
U.S. Mortgage Corp.
