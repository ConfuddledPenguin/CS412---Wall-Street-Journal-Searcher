   WASHINGTON -- Top officials of two health organizations
have accused Genentech Inc. of using heavy-handed techniques
in lobbying against changes in the Orphan Drug Act.
   In one instance, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society
complained to Genentech President Robert Swanson that the
South San Francisco, Calif., biotechnology company had
falsely claimed to have the group's support in fighting a
move to change the law. The complaint was made in a May 10
letter by Martha Keys, the organization's vice president,
public affairs.

   The Orphan Drug Act confers seven-year monopolies on
drugs, including Genentech's human growth hormone, developed
for certain rare diseases. The law was intended to encourage
drug companies to develop otherwise unprofitable drugs. But a
few companies, including Genentech, have reaped handsome
profits as a result of the law and have spent vast sums
lobbying against efforts to modify it.
   Regarding the complaint by Ms. Keys, a Genentech spokesman
said the company had been told by certain individuals
affiliated with the Multiple Sclerosis Society "but not
actually working for it" that the group did support
Genentech's position. He said Genentech quickly discovered it
was in error, and its officials stopped citing the group as a
supporter.
   A second charge is that in attempting to enlist the
support of health groups, Genentech indicated it would cease
plans for developing a drug to treat cystic fibrosis if the
orphan-drug law were changed. The company vehemently denied
the charge and denied that company officials made statements
the health advocates attribute to them.
   Nevertheless, Dr. Jess Thoene, president of the National
Organization for Rare Disorders, insisted that Genentech's
Mr. Swanson informed him this year that if the law's
guarantee of seven-year exclusivity were "deleted or
modified," Genentech would scrap its plans to develop the
cystic fibrosis treatment.
   Mr. Swanson yesterday pointed out that the cystic fibrosis
drug, DNase, recently began clinical trials. He added that
the orphan-drug law's seven-year exclusivity was "a key part"
of Genentech's decision to develop the drug.
   In a separate incident, Robert Beall, executive vice
president, medical affairs, of the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, said a Genentech lobbyist told him that any major
changes in the act "would discourage drug companies from
developing drugs like DNase in the future."
   Neither Dr. Thoene nor Mr. Beall characterized Genentech's
position as an explicit threat aimed at their organizations.
But after Mr. Beall spoke to the Genentech official, Mr.
Beall phoned Abbey Meyers, executive director of the National
Organization for Rare Disorders, to say that if her
organization didn't join his and Genentech's opposition to
the bill, several members in her organization would resign.
   Ms. Meyers characterizes this as a threat "to destroy
NORD." Mr. Beall concedes that he "felt very strongly" that
Ms. Meyers had a responsibility to inform her members about
the "likely consequence" of changing the bill. But he says
his statement that she would lose members was a prediction,
not a threat.
   Ultimately, Mr. Beall's group opposed changes in the
orphan-drug law, while Ms. Meyers's group supported them.
   According to one White House aide, "The drug companies
lobbied this thing like you've never seen." Eventually,
Genentech's human growth hormone was exempted from the
orphan-drug revisions approved by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. The matter awaits action on the House
floor and in the Senate.
