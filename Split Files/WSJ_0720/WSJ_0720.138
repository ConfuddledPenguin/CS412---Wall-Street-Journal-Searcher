   SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp., continuing its
rebound, posted relatively good earnings and strong
improvements in its asset quality for its second quarter.
   Net income for the quarter was $267 million, or $1.17 a
share, compared with year-ago earnings of $304 million, or
$1.50 a share. However, analysts consider the current results
to be a slight improvement over year-ago figures, which were
lifted by $44 million from cash interest payments made by
Brazilian borrowers. BankAmerica received no such payments
from Brazil this quarter.

   While the results were in line with expectations, analysts
were pleased with what were described as "significant"
progress in reducing the amount of nonperforming assets.
   "They had across-the-board, significant improvements in
that area," said J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst at
Montgomery Securities Inc.
   The bank holding company said that during the quarter, it
reduced its nonaccrual assets by 21%, to $3.1 billion.
Nonaccrual assets related to restructuring countries fell
even more -- to $2.2 billion, from $3 billion.
   BankAmerica also reported a 21.5% reduction in the amount
of domestic real-estate loans on nonaccrual status. "You have
all these nervous nellies back East talking about the
California real-estate market slumping, and here
(BankAmerica) is reporting improvements," said Michael
Abrahams, an analyst at Bateman Eichler Hill Richards in Los
Angeles.
