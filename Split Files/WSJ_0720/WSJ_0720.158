   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cominco Ltd. and the United
Steelworkers of America reached a tentative two-year contract
late Wednesday, which is expected to bring an end to a strike
that began July 9 at the company's big lead-zinc smelter
complex.
   The proposed pact, which was predicted by union officials
earlier this week, covers about 2,900 workers at Cominco's
Trail, British Columbia, lead-zinc smelter operations, and
700 workers at the company's currently inactive Sullivan
lead-zinc mine, in Kimberley, B.C.

   The accord calls for an average hourly wage increase of
about 18.5% over two years at Trail, a union official said,
as well as increases in pension and other payments. Union
members are expected to vote on the proposed pact today, and
workers are expected to be called back to their jobs
immediately, a company spokeswoman said.
   The pact also provides for a resumption of operations
later this year at the Sullivan mine, which Cominco closed
earlier this year, citing operating losses and low zinc
prices. Prices for the metal have since risen, and Cominco
plans to invest about 11 million Canadian dollars (US$9.5
million) at Sullivan to make it more viable, the company's
spokeswoman said.
   Cominco's previous contract with the union expired June
30. In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Cominco's
shares closed at C$26.50 each, unchanged.
