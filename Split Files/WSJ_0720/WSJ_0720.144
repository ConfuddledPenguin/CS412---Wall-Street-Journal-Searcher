   WASHINGTON -- While most of Congress still happily rakes
in savings and loan contributions, one of the industry's
biggest beneficiaries has decided on a new policy.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics
Committee for his ties to a failed savings and loan, said
yesterday that he will give $120,000 to the Treasury,
representing S&amp;L campaign donations received since 1983.

   "The magnitude of the problems in the S&amp;L industry --
stemming from multiple causes over a 15-year period -- leave
a shadow across the industry and across any campaign
contributions from that industry," the Michigan Democrat
said.
   He also said that in the future, his campaign won't accept
money from officers or political action committees of
companies that fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate
Banking Committee, of which he is chairman.
   In 1988, Sen. Riegle returned $78,250 in contributions to
a fund-raising event sponsored by Charles Keating, who
controlled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, a unit of
American Continental Corp. The Ethics Committee is
investigating Sen. Riegle, along with four other senators,
following their private meeting with regulators in which the
senators requested a speedier examination of Lincoln's
records. Lincoln's failure -- the biggest ever -- cost
taxpayers $2 billion.
