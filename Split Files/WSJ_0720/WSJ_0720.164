   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. wants communities in New
York state to compete for a giant new landfill the company
wants to build.
   Several industrialists and environmentalists think the
company's innovative plan, while flawed, might work. If it
does, it could be a boon for builders and would-be owners of
planned power plants, oil refineries, trash incinerators and
other facilities that often face local opposition.

   While one expert doubts the strategy will work for
landfills, he thinks it might work for a nuclear power plant.
   In Albany, N.Y., Browning-Ferris Chairman William D.
Ruckelshaus announced that the Houston-based waste-services
firm plans to build a combination landfill and recycling
center in New York, a state which faces a critical shortage
of disposal capacity.
   Rather than have the company choose a site, however, Mr.
Ruckelshaus said Browning-Ferris wants any of 1,400 or so
potential host communities to step forward and express an
interest.
   "It's Your Choice" is the subtitle of a booklet the
company will mail to local elected officials soliciting their
interest. The booklet's title, "An Invitation to Benefit Your
Community," is meant to highlight the revenue, job and other
advantages. The company also pledges to "protect" property
values and groundwater supplies, and to provide financial
"assistance" for any needed new roads, sewers, and other
facilities.
   Several experts expressed reservations. "Even if (the
company) gets some bites, opponents will come out of the
woodwork later on," said J. Winston Porter, a former
Environmental Protection Agency assistant administrator for
solid waste.
   Still, most thought the company's approach should defuse
local opposition enough to give the company a better chance
of siting its landfill than if it were simply to pick a site
and then try to sell the community on it. What's more, with a
couple of additional tactics, these experts said the
Browning-Ferris strategy would have an even better chance of
success.
   "No matter how greased (the plan) is, it can always meet
with opposition," although the company's approach "does give
you a leg up," said Bob McCabe, president of Narragansett
Electric Co., a unit of New England Electric System. Mr.
McCabe gives Browning-Ferris a 60% better chance of
succeeding and adds that the company's chances would be even
better were it also to promise financial benefits to
communities through which all those garbage trucks will have
to pass, kicking up both dust and safety concerns.
   While the company's literature doesn't address surrounding
communities, a company spokesman says Browning-Ferris will
assist them, too.
   Hoff Stauffer, an energy and environmental expert with
Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., the consulting firm, gives the
Browning-Ferris strategy a 25% to 50% better chance of
success. He adds that the company would, in his opinion, have
up to a 75% better chance if, after an initial expression of
interest by a local politician, senior company executives
then personally visited the people who would be living
nearest to the landfill. "This is an emotional issue. You
have to have a very human effort. Using senior executives
would show you really care," says Mr. Stauffer.
   The Browning-Ferris spokesman says the company isn't
ruling out house-to-house visits by senior executives.
   Whatever the company does, however, "It's still going to
take a pretty heroic local official" to express initial
interest in a landfill, believes John Willson, a director of
the environmental, health and safety practice at Arthur D.
Little Inc., the consulting firm. (Mr. Willson gives
Browning-Ferris at most only a 20% better chance of success.)
   Not so, counters David Critchfield, manager of regulatory
affairs at International Paper Co. "At the right price,
somebody will raise his hand," he says. Mr. Critchfield
further believes that the Browning-Ferris strategy could
channel public opposition into constructive pressure on the
company to live up to its environmental pledges.
   Then there's David Sokol, president of Ogden Projects
Inc., a trash-incineration and recycling concern, who doubts
the strategy will work for a landfill, but thinks it could
work for a nuclear power plant. Mr. Sokol argues that,
whereas opposition by the surrounding communities likely will
kill any community's interest in hosting a landfill, it
wouldn't necessarily kill an atomic power plant because
surrounding communities would feel that they, too, were
benefiting from the plant's power production.
