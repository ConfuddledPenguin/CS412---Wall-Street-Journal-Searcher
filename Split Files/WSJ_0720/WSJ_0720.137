   Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., an 80%-owned subsidiary
of the E.W. Scripps Co., said it has agreed to purchase
WMAR-TV in Baltimore from the Gillett Group Inc. for $154.7
million.
   The station, an affiliate of National Broadcasting Co.,
which is a unit of General Electric Co., recently signed a
new three-year contract to continue as the flagship station
for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

   The Gillett Group is controlled by George N. Gillett Jr.,
who for several years has been trying to sell his TV stations
to pay off junk-bond debt. Mr. Gillett, a Denver businessman,
also controls SCI Television Inc., which has had to
restructure $1.3 billion in debt.
   Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive officer
of E.W. Scripps, said the company has not made a major
acquisition since 1986, "preferring to wait until an
attractive opportunity presented itself."
   Cincinnati-based Scripps Howard Broadcasting currently
operates nine television stations.
