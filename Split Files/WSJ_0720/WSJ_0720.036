   TOKYO -- Japan's wholesale prices in the first 10 days of
July edged up 0.1% from the previous 10 days and rose 1% from
a year earlier, the Bank of Japan said.
   The wholesale price index, in which the year 1985 is equal
to 100, stood at 90.6. The price gains in the latest period
followed a drop in June of 0.1% from May and a 0.9% increase
from a year earlier.
