   John O'Brien resigned unexpectedly as chairman, chief
executive officer and president of Grumman Corp.
   The Bethpage, N.Y., aerospace concern said Mr. O'Brien, 60
years old, resigned for personal reasons. The company named
Renso Caporali to succeed him while it "considers candidates
for these positions from both inside and outside the
company."

   Mr. Caporali had been vice chairman, technology, in charge
of the office of corporate technology; he was responsible for
research, development, engineering and advanced systems
functions.
   Grumman's announcement included no comment on Mr.
O'Brien's record as the company's top executive, leaving the
impression that the departure was on less than cordial terms.
The announcement followed Grumman's monthly board meeting
yesterday.
   Mr. O'Brien, who joined the company in the mid-1950s, was
named chairman two years ago. He was selected as president
and chief operating officer in 1986 and as chief executive in
early 1988.
   His resignation comes as the company is struggling to cope
with the impact of Pentagon spending cuts. Last month,
Grumman announced it would offer early retirement incentives
to 6,000 employees, or 21% of its work force, to cut costs.
Acceptance of the offer by half the eligible employees would
save $100 million, the company said.
   Jerry Cantwell, a securities analyst at Wertheim &amp; Co.,
New York, speculated that Mr. O'Brien's sudden departure may
be a bad omen. "The implication is clearly that there is some
damaging news coming," he said. "I'm really sad to see this
happen. I think he was doing a really terrific job with the
company." Mr. Cantwell's recommendation on Grumman stock
remains neutral, he said.
   Senior Defense Department officials also didn't have any
advance warning of the resignation, which prompted a flurry
of speculation inside the Pentagon.
   Grumman had surfaced in two federal criminal
investigations into possible Pentagon procurement fraud and
illegal document-swapping, but none of the company's top
officials have been identified as targets of those inquiries.
   In March, the company pleaded guilty to illegally using
Pentagon budget documents and paid $2.5 million in fines and
penalties. Also this year, a former Grumman aide pleaded
guilty to fraud-related charges stemming from his dealings
with a Long Island, N.Y., political action committee under
investigation for allegedly funneling illegal campaign
contributions to lawmakers. A federal grand jury in New York
continues to investigate Grumman's involvement with that
committee.
   Grumman's sales have been sluggish in recent years,
totaling between $3.38 billion and $3.65 billion annually in
the past four years, including $3.56 billion in 1989. Net
income in 1989 was $67.3 million, or $1.91 a share, down from
$86.5 million, or $2.50 a share, a year earlier. At year-end
its backlog totaled $6.89 billion, down from $7.25 billion a
year earlier.
   In May, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings
on $525 million of Grumman debt and preferred, citing
unfavorable conditions in the defense industry and high
debt-service costs. Interest expense totaled $105 million
last year, up from $84.9 million a year earlier and $59
million in 1987.
   Mr. Caporali, 56, joined Grumman in 1959 as a structural
flight test engineer, and from 1968 through 1973 he held
various positions in the F-14 aircraft program; he was
elected a vice president in 1980 and was named vice chairman
of corporate technology in mid-1988. He holds two masters
degrees and a doctorate in aeronautical engineering from
Princeton University.
   Grumman's announcement said that Mr. Caporali, speaking
for the board, intends to continue restructuring the company
into a "more efficient and cost-competitive form" while
continuing to "develop the technologies that make sense for
our rapidly changing markets."
   Grumman said Mr. O'Brien resigned from the board "but will
be available to help achieve an orderly transition."
   Besides the abruptness of Mr. O'Brien's departure,
Wertheim's Mr. Cantwell said Grumman's handling of the matter
leaves him with the impression that there was some trouble.
Grumman's investor relations staff, he said, which is
"normally pretty cooperative," was anything but that
concerning the resignation. "All they'll do now is read the
press release," he said.
   Other analysts also praised Mr. O'Brien's performance as
chairman.
   Weyman B. Jones, Grumman's vice president of public
affairs, said "there's no limitation on" Mr. Caporali's
tenure as chairman, even though the board will be considering
other candidates for the top job. He added that Mr. Caporali
"is obviously an inside candidate" to fill the positions.
