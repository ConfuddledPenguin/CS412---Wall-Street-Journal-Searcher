   MOORPARK, Calif. -- Terminal Data Corp. said it "accepted
the resignation" of David W. Krar Hutton as the company's
president and chief executive officer.
   The designer and maker of electronic document imaging
systems said Mr. Hutton agreed to serve as chief operating
officer, a new post, until the company names a successor.

   Richard M. Drysdale, who was named chairman in April, said
he will assume the additional responsibilities of chief
executive officer until Mr. Hutton's successor has been
selected.
   Mr. Drysdale said Mr. Hutton's departure "was a mutual
agreement. Both the company and Hutton felt some different
capabilities were needed." Mr. Drysdale added, "Clearly the
performance of the company over the last couple years hasn't
shown the improvement we would like."
   In an interview, Mr. Krar Hutton would say only that he
"resigned to pursue other interests."
   For the six months ended March 31, the company posted a
net loss of $1.5 million, compared with a loss of $861,000 a
year ago.
