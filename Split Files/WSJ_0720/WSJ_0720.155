   Despite a small operating loss in its oil and gas
division, Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s second-quarter net
income rose 11% to $89 million, or 30 cents a share.
   In the year earlier, Los Angeles-based Occidental had net
of $80 million, or 29 cents a share. Sales edged up to $5.12
billion from $5.05 billion.

   Occidental's income before extraordinary items fell 18% to
$69 million. The extraordinary items included a $20 million
gain from tax-loss carry-forwards. Profit was bolstered
further by a $27 million benefit from the reversal of certain
tax reserves. The reversals resulted from an Internal Revenue
Service audit of Occidental and certain subsidiaries that
determined the reserves are no longer necessary.
