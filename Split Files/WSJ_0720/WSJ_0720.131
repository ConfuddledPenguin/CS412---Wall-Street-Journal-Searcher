   "As exciting as a flat Perrier" -- the Los Angeles Times.
   The reviews for "Jetsons: The Movie," are rolling in, and
they are awful. The box office isn't much better. In its
first 10 days, the animated movie about George Jetson, Jane,
his wife, his boy, Elroy, and the rest of the space-age
family grossed just $10.9 million, according to Variety, less
than "Ghost" pulled in for its first weekend. And the trade
newspaper showed that last weekend's box-office take
nosedived 43%, suggesting that word of mouth isn't about to
save the day either.
   But it's too late for the 200 or so licensed Jetson
products hitting the stores now. In one of the summer's most
aggressive merchandising pushes, Hamilton Projects, licensing
agent for Jetsons creator Hanna-Barbera, has licensed the
cartoon characters to more than 60 companies that have
produced every imaginable Jetsons item.
   We're talking more than T-shirts here. You can find
Jetsons toothbrushes, Jetsons collectible figures, and $400
Jetsons jackets. Wendy's is in the midst of a Jetsons tie-in.
Warner-Lambert is test marketing Jetsons Gummies and Jetsons
Cosmic Candies, while Ralston Purina is about to bring out
Jetsons cereal. The merchandise is in stores, ad budgets are
spent, and marketing plans are in full swing. All that's
missing is the audience.
   The Jetsons' predicament points up the risk licensees take
when betting big on a movie. In the wake of the Batman
phenomenon last year, when $500 million of merchandise was
snatched up in a single season, movie merchandising has
exploded. "Dick Tracy" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" are
just two of the other big summer releases counting on a
merchandising bonanza. All want their piece of the estimated
$65 billion U.S. merchandising pie. Yet licensees with
visions of "Batman" take the risk that instead, their movie
could sink without a trace.
   When a movie bombs, "it doesn't necessarily kill" the
merchandising program, said Ira Mayer, publisher and editor
of Brooklyn-based Entertainment Marketing Letter, "but it
isn't going to do anywhere near as well."
   The question for the Jetsons is, will it do well enough?
Seth M. Siegel, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Hamilton Projects, said it will; the Jetson
licensees can make a profit even if the movie isn't a
blockbuster. "Our business plan went in with modest
expectations that nevertheless presented us with
profitability," he said. "Our hope is always the movie would
be a $40 million film. But in any event, we think the movie
performance to date has done just fine for us."
   Optimistic, as executives in his business tend to be, he
added, "I think one could look at it as being very, very
successful in terms of a repositioning, a reintroduction.
Also, the summer isn't over yet."
   Other entertainment executives say the Jetsons merchandise
has a chance of at least modest success because since being
introduced in 1962, the cartoon has spent decades in reruns.
"Lack of success {at theaters} doesn't necessarily mean the
merchandise won't move," said Arnold Bolka, publisher of the
Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Licensing Letter, a trade
publication. "The Jetsons have a life of their own. They've
built a following through the decades, and it may well be
that the current licensing will be successful regardless of
the box office."
   No doubt about it, though, big box-office receipts would
go a long way in making Jetsons merchandise a bigger seller.
Hamilton Projects' Mr. Siegel said a blockbuster film's
merchandise sales may be three or even six times those of a
moderately successful movie. If the Jetsons had turned into a
blockbuster, he said, "we have the machinery in place for a
bonanza, and we had the retailers primed."
   Among other things, he said, if the movie had been a
runaway hit, Hamilton Projects would have helped organize
Jetson "boutiques" in stores, which would feature all sorts
of Jetsons memorabilia in one place. Now, merchandise will
more likely be spread throughout the store, with kids'
T-shirts in the children's clothing department and mugs in
housewares. Most of the Jetsons merchandise is in inexpensive
mass marketers like K mart and Wal-Mart.
   Several Jetson licensees, including Wendy's,
Warner-Lambert and Ralston Purina, say they're satisfied
despite the movie's poor showing in its first two weeks. If
it had been a blockbuster hit, Wendy's would have ordered up
more plastic Jetsons cups for the tie-in that began Monday. A
blockbuster might also help prolong the life of Jetsons
cereal, which, like all of Ralston's licensed cereals, is
expected to have a life span of only 12 to 18 months. But
executives at both companies say the Jetsons characters are
strong enough to justify the tie-ins even without a movie.
   "I'd be absolutely thrilled if the movie turned out to be
a blockbuster. But I'm not concerned that the poor reviews
will negatively impact" on the Jetsons candies in test market
in Atlanta, said Joseph McDonough, product manager for new
ventures for Warner-Lambert. "We're tapping into the
tremendous equity that has developed over the past 30 years."
