   Onex Corp. said its Beatrice Foods Inc. unit agreed to
acquire Palm Dairies Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta, dairy, baked
goods and cheese-making concern.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but Toronto-based Onex said the
operations of Palm Dairies will add about 130 million
Canadian dollars (US$112.6 million) annually to Beatrice's
total sales. In 1989, Beatrice reported revenue of C$672.1
million.

   Last year, Beatrice paid C$40 million to acquire Eplett
Dairies Ltd. Gerry Schwartz, Onex's chairman and chief
executive officer, said this year that the company was
planning another dairy acquisition of similar size. He said
Onex had about C$110 million available in cash to finance
acquisitions.
   Beatrice plans to acquire Palm Dairies Ltd. from closely
held Pocklington Financial Corp., Onex said.
   The acquisition "strengthens our presence in Western
Canada and represents an important opportunity for Beatrice
to broaden its distribution and processing base," said Don
McCarthy, chairman of Beatrice.
   Palm Dairies has operations in Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Northern Ontario.
