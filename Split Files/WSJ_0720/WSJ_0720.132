   Accor S.A., a French hospitality company, said in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Motel 6 L.P.
has projected its net income for the 1990 fiscal year ending
Dec. 31 will be $19.6 million on revenue of $477.4 million.
   The projection was made in connection with a tender offer
made last week by Accor S.A. to acquire Motel 6 of Dallas for
$22.50 a unit, or nearly $1.3 billion. Accor said the figure
was used in merger talks.

   In a related filing, Motel 6 said that three class-action
suits have been filed to block the acquisition. Motel 6
executives weren't available for comment.
   Although the merger isn't conditioned on financing, Accor
said it estimates it will need $1.3 billion to cover costs of
the deal, including buying the shares and paying fees and
expenses. Accor said it would borrow the money from Banque
Indosuez and Societe Generale under a special credit
arrangement and from its existing working capital and credit
lines.
   The French company also said it will explore ways to
refinance Motel 6's existing debt after the deal is
completed.
   Accor also said it has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
a fee of $1 million for acting as a dealer-manager in the
offer. Motel 6, in its filing, said it has agreed to pay
Salomon Brothers Inc. $5.5 million for acting as its
financial adviser.
