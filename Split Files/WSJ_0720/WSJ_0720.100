   On Tuesday the House came within seven votes of passing a
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. The amendment
won 43 more votes than in the last attempt in 1982. No doubt
Members who voted in favor will trumpet that support
throughout their fall campaigns. But many of them will have
paid only lip service to what voters really want: a balanced
budget that restrains the uncontrolled growth of the federal
government.
   The House considered two balanced-budget amendments. The
one that came close to being adopted was sponsored by Texas
Democrat Charles Stenholm and Idaho Republican Larry Craig.
It required a balanced budget unless a three-fifths vote of
both houses declared otherwise. However, to raise taxes to
balance the budget only a simple majority was required. That
created a procedural path of least resistance in favor of tax
increases.

   Before the vote on the Stenholm-Craig proposal, the House
considered a substitute amendment by GOP Rep. Joe Barton of
Texas. The Barton amendment was similar to Stenholm-Craig,
but also limited increases in government revenues to the
growth in national income unless a three-fifths vote of
Congress decided otherwise. That limitation mirrored several
found in state constitutions.
   By requiring the same super-majority to raise taxes and
increase spending, the Barton amendment leveled the playing
field. It made it unlikely that Members of Congress could
raise taxes by majority vote and use the three-fifths
requirement to violate a balanced budget as the excuse: "The
Constitution made me raise your taxes."
   While Stenholm-Craig was favored by 279 to 150 -- still
not the required two-thirds -- the Barton substitute lost by
244 to 184. The Members who voted against both obviously have
no interest in changing the system that got us into the
current mess. The 95 Members of Congress -- 74 Democrats and
21 Republicans -- whose names appear below voted for
Stenholm-Craig but against Barton. In effect, they are trying
to have it both ways. Those Members wanted to be recorded as
supporting a balanced budget, but at the same time make
certain they buried the amendment that would have put a real
crimp in the spending habits that create deficit spending.
   Members have become masters at using House rules to
obfuscate votes and confuse voters as to their real stand on
issues. No doubt many of these 95 Members will have
interesting explanations for why they opposed a
balanced-budget amendment with teeth:
