   Bamberger Polymers Inc. said it secured a temporary
restraining order against 11 former sales and marketing
employees, who, it said, are starting a competing plastics
business.
   The New Hyde Park, N.Y., plastics merchant has said loss
of the employees would have a "material adverse effect" on
its sales and earnings from the Northeast and West Coast
operations in the third quarter.

   The order enjoins the former employees from soliciting
Bamberger employees, contacting its customers, or using
confidential information obtained from Bamberger.
   Walter Craig, legal counsel for Helm Resources Inc., a
holding company that controls about half of Bamberger, said
the defecting workers are "engaged in basically the same
business they were involved in, the trading and sale of
thermoplastic resins."
   The company also is seeking damages against the former
employees. A request for a preliminary injunction will be
considered Tuesday.
   None of the defendants could be reached for comment.
