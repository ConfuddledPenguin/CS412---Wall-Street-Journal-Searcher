   LONDON -- Fujitsu Ltd. is negotiating for control of
Britain's largest computer maker in a move that could sharpen
competition for International Business Machines Corp. and
other U.S. and European companies in the European market.
   Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer company, is set to take
a majority holding in International Computers Ltd., a unit of
U.K. electronics concern STC PLC. While neither Fujitsu nor
STC would comment on the deal, which was initially reported
in London's Financial Times, officials at both companies
confirmed that discussions are taking place. A formal bid is
expected within three weeks, and analysts estimate its value
at up to #600 million ($1.08 billion).

   Fujitsu's bid would represent the first major move by a
Japanese computer company into Europe. If the pattern in
other industries holds, more Japanese computer companies
could follow Fujitsu's lead.
   "I think IBM may have to be a little worried about its
future in Europe," said Mamoru Miki, managing director of
Cores Europe Ltd., a London-based market consultant with many
Japanese clients. Mr. Miki mentioned Hitachi Ltd., which
already has links with Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. and other
European companies, as another major Japanese player that
could move aggressively into Europe. Among other Japanese
computer companies, NEC Corp. already has a 15% stake in a
subsidiary of the French company, Cie. des Machines Bull.
   Fujitsu has been supplying semiconductors to ICL since
1983, so initially the bid for ICL "secures a captive market
the Japanese already have," said Phillipe de Marcillac, a
Paris-based analyst with Dataquest Inc. But the move also
would end speculation about ICL's future and give it a parent
company with much deeper pockets than STC, "which means that
ICL's existing customers are more likely to remain loyal,"
Mr. de Marcillac added. Fujitsu might also use ICL as "a
launch pad for its midrange computers," which it has thus far
failed to market significantly outside Japan, he said.
   Currently, ICL's strength is in mainframes; it is a major
supplier to both the U.K. government and leading U.K.
retailers. It has a market share in the U.K. of about 20%,
second only to IBM. ICL is weak on the Continent, though it
has had an office in the Soviet Union for 30 years and now
has several joint ventures there and in Poland. These also
could prove useful to Fujitsu as the Eastern European market
opens up.
   "This industry is market-driven now," observed George
Verghese, electronics analyst at the securities research unit
of Deutsche Bank AG in London. "Fujitsu has the technology,
but it needed a company like ICL that has the market
know-how." He calls ICL the best-managed computer company in
Europe.
   However, a spokesman for Bull, the French computer group,
said ICL's linkage with Fujitsu might also open up the U.K.
market for other producers. "ICL has always been very strong
in the U.K. government market, almost a national champion,"
he said. "Now, with Fujitsu as a primary partner, they become
more like everyone else." Some analysts also speculated that
the deal could be held up by security considerations, as ICL
is a major supplier of Britain's defense ministry and other
sensitive departments. There could also be political
objections, on the grounds that a flagship British company
shouldn't fall into Japanese hands.
   "There is going to be a certain loss of indigenous
technology, which is symptomatic of a government that has
focused on service industries rather than technology," said
Jane Doorly, a London-based computer-industry analyst with
Dataquest.
   She added, though, that consolidation in Europe was
inevitable because "this arena just can't sustain so many
players with the levels of (research and development) needed
to chase the Americans."
   Possible partnerships between ICL and other European
players have long been rumored, and many analysts expected
Fujitsu to purchase a minority stake in ICL. But they were
surprised by the report that the Japanese company now seeks
50%-60%. With profit margins in Europe shrinking and the
falling U.S. dollar making American products more
competitive, "STC could see they were facing very high costs
to keep up," said Richard Harwood, U.K. head of research at
Schroder Securities Ltd., London.
   Mr. Harwood estimated that ICL accounts for 55% of STC's
earnings. ICL's half-year results, due later this month,
could be disappointing, he added, "because they have recently
launched products that won't be shipped until the second half
of the year. Their order book, though, is very strong." STC
shares were up 24 pence in late trading in London to 281
pence, having soared to 295 pence earlier in the day.
   Spokesmen for IBM in both the U.S. and Europe declined to
comment on the deal, as did Munich-based Siemens AG, which is
supplied in part by Fujitsu. The ICL deal is not expected to
affect Fujitsu's relationship with Siemens as there is very
little overlap between ICL's and Siemens' markets.
