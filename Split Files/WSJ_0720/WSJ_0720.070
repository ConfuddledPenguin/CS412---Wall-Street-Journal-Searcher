   Nynex Corp., BellSouth Corp. and Ameritech posted solid
gains in second-quarter profit, spurred by cellular and
access lines growth. But Southwestern Bell Co. reported flat
earnings, and Pacific Telesis Group posted an 8.9% drop.
   Results were generally what analysts anticipated. "Growth
is very much in line with expectations," said Frank
Governali, an analyst with First Boston Corp. "Ameritech was
the only one with any surprise at all."

   Nynex, which took a $39 million onetime charge for an
early retirement program, reported a 7.7% increase in net
income due to gains in its telephone operations, mobile
communications and software subsidiaries. Revenue rose to
$3.44 billion from $3.3 billion. About 4,000 managers of New
York-based Nynex signed up for the special early-retirement
program. "It looks like Nynex had slightly more and earlier
cost reductions than expected," said Dan Reingold, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Profit of Chicago-based Ameritech surprised some analysts,
surging 11.3% with strong volume growth in access lines, toll
calls and minutes of use. A tight rein on costs helped to
boost net income to $352.3 million. During the quarter,
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp., along with two New Zealand
companies, were chosen by the New Zealand government to buy
the state-owned telephone company for about $2.4 billion.
   BellSouth's net income rose 6.5%, but revenue growth, up
5.7%, was damped by rate reductions in several Southeast
states. The Atlanta-based company's cellular unit added
62,355 customers in the quarter and reported income of $13.1
million compared with a $2.6 million loss the year earlier.
   Southwestern Bell's net income edged up 0.4%, despite a
1.9% drop in phone company income due to rate cutbacks and a
one-time $18.1 million pretax charge for inventory. Results
were helped by 71,000 new cellular customers added during the
period, more than twice the number of new customers that
signed up the year before. Without the write-down for
inventory, St. Louis-based Southwestern's earnings would be
90 cents a share, compared with 83 cents the year before.
   Pacific Telesis blamed a new rate structure in California,
investment in network improvements, labor contracts and
depreciation of equipment. Earnings for the quarter were $287
million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $325 million, or
79 cents a share, the year before. Pacific Telesis, based in
San Francisco, reported revenue of $2.43 billion, vs. $2.4
billion.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nynex closed at $77.75, down 37.5 cents; BellSouth
closed at $52.25, down 25 cents; Southwestern Bell closed at
$53.875, unchanged; Ameritech closed at $60.625, up 50 cents,
and Pacific Telesis closed at $43, down 12.5 cents.
