   DALLAS -- Centex Corp. reported record first-quarter
earnings at its annual shareholders meeting, where picketers
appeared to protest the construction company's planned
acquisition of home sites from the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Centex reported earnings of $16.5 million, or $1.05 a
share, on revenue of $565.9 million for the first quarter,
which ended June 30. Earnings for the year-earlier period
were $15.3 million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $464.6
million.

   Laurence E. Hirsch, president and chief executive officer,
attributed the record results to a 29% increase in earnings
from the company's home-building and mortgage-banking units.
Those units reported earnings of $25.9 million on revenue of
$277.4 million for the first quarter. The year earlier, the
units reported earnings of $20.1 million on revenue of $203.4
million.
   One of the company's home-building units, Fox &amp; Jacobs,
has a contract to acquire 108 lots in a residential
subdivision of Arlington, Texas, from the RTC, which took
over the property after the failure of an Arlington thrift.
Fox &amp; Jacobs offered $1,890,000 in cash, or about $17,500 per
lot, for the property in the Parker Oaks Estates subdivision.
   But the sale hasn't closed because the Parker Oaks Estates
Homeowners Association is seeking a court order to force Fox
&amp; Jacobs to comply with deed restrictions that dictate the
style and size of homes to be built on the lots. The RTC has
joined the lawsuit, which is currently pending in federal
court in Fort Worth, Texas.
   About 15 picketers, representing the homeowners
association, marched outside the building where Centex held
its annual shareholders meeting yesterday. All were carrying
signs protesting Fox &amp; Jacobs's plans for the lots.
   "We've got an established character . . . of a custom-home
neighborhood," said John Ezell, spokesman for the homeowners
association. "Centex hasn't convinced us that they're going
to come out there and build the kind of home that's already
there."
   Mr. Ezell said the homeowners are also disturbed at the
$17,500 price tag that the RTC has placed on each lot to be
acquired by Fox &amp; Jacobs. Previous sales of individual lots
by the RTC brought $34,000 to $38,000 each, he said.
   Centex Chairman Paul Seegers was asked about the
litigation and the protest at the shareholders meeting but
declined to comment. "We're waiting for the outcome" of the
lawsuit, he said.
