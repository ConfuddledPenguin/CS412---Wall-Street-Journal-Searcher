   PITTSBURGH -- PPG Industries Inc., threatened with
multimillion-dollar lawsuits over toxic chromium wastes,
agreed to pay New Jersey's Department of Environmental
Protection $80 million for cleanups, as well as a $2.5
million fine.
   The glass, chemical and coating company, which has been
pursued by state regulators for eight years, also agreed to
pay $900,000 to cover administrative expenses and the cleanup
of a Jersey City school, among other things. In addition, PPG
dropped its lawsuits against New Jersey.

   Under the agreement, PPG will clean up chromium waste at
53 sites in Hudson County, N.J., where until 1964 the company
processed chromium ore to make paint pigments. The resulting
slag-iron laced with chromium and other chemicals -- was used
as landfill in the area. Chromium is a hazardous substance
that can cause serious ailments, including cancer.
   The sites include 32 residential properties, where PPG has
agreed to excavate contaminated soil "to a very stringent
standard," said Michael Schuit, a state regulatory lawyer
involved in the settlement. At the remaining industrial and
commercial sites, PPG will propose and the state will approve
various cleanup remedies.
   To cover some of the cleanup costs, PPG is taking a $25
million pretax charge for the second quarter. It reported
record net income of $141 million, or $1.31 a share, on sales
of $1.57 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, net was $127.3
million, or $1.13 a share, on sales of $1.49 billion. The
company said the charge, along with earlier reserves and
"other measures," would cover its cleanup bill. PPG wouldn't
elaborate further.
   However, Mr. Schuit noted that if the cleanup bill for the
53 sites exceeds $80 million, "PPG will have to pay. There's
no spending limit." The company will also be responsible for
any additional sites that the state discovers and links to
PPG.
   Analysts were optimistic that future earnings won't be
hurt. The charge "is the only impact we should see on
earnings," said Charles LoCastro, a securities analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "This essentially puts the
matter behind them."
   The settlement came after state regulators ordered PPG to
pay $31.5 million in cleanup costs and threatened to seek
treble that amount in court if the company resisted. It's the
second chromium-waste settlement secured by New Jersey. In
April, Maxus Energy Corp., a Dallas petroleum producer
formerly called Diamond Shamrock, agreed to provide as much
as $51.5 million for cleanups and to pay a $2.5 million fine.
   The two settlements comprise the "largest privately funded
cleanup -- and will go a long way toward the renaissance of
Jersey City," said Thomas McKee, a state enforcement agent.
The cleanup cost in New York's celebrated Love Canal case,
which was publicly funded, totaled about $120 million.
   State regulators added that they plan action against a
third company, Allied-Signal Inc., which acquired a closed
chromium-processing plant in Jersey City as part of its 1954
purchase of Mutual Chemical Co. of America. Allied sold the
plant site just a few months later, but the state still holds
it responsible for the plant's slag. A spokesman for the
Morristown, N.J., automotive and aerospace company said,
"We've been talking for some time" with New Jersey
regulators.
