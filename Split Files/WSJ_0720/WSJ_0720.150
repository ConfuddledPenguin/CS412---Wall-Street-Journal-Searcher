   Tokyo's Nikkei Index spurted higher in the last three
minutes of trading, as program buying on the index by U.S.
brokerage houses helped maintain a close above 33000 points.
   Meanwhile, London shares trailed Wall Street and closed at
their intraday lows.

   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 7.51 points to
33055.62, after dipping as low as 32847 points, or down 201
points.
   "Someone obviously wanted to see the index hold that 33000
level," said one trader at a U.K. firm, noting that futures
weren't at a high enough premium for arbitrage.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei fell 361.16
points to 32694.46.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, off from 621.5 million shares Wednesday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 560-383, while 176 issues
were unchanged.
   Traders said the market was broadly lower, as reflected by
the average-based index, as selling pressure in the afternoon
reversed morning gains by "inflation hedge" stocks.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section slipped 4.70 points, or 0.19%, to 2393.08.
   The second section index dropped 17.19 points, or 0.39%,
to 4384.89. Volume was estimated at 20 million shares, off
from 23 million shares.
   Some investment trust funds were canceling on index funds
yesterday, traders noted. The investment trusts regularly
adjust the imbalance between cancellations and buying, with
yesterday's adjustment showing more cancellations, the
traders said.
   One trader said that related selling was "rather minor,"
but another noted that whenever the funds come with the
intent to sell, the psychological impact shouldn't be
ignored.
   Profit-taking in the afternoon also contributed to selling
pressure, as traders took their short-term capital gains
after three days of advances by speculation-driven stocks.
   In the morning, investors had been readjusting positions
and purchasing some shares that would safeguard their
positions in case of visible inflationary movement, traders
said.
   But as the profit-taking set in, other investors moved to
the sidelines, holding back on buying and joining the
generally bearish financial market sentiment, traders said.
   One trader said that with currently high interest rates,
institutional investors aren't willing to lower cash
positions and add to their positions.
   "If anything, they'll buy things that aren't already in
their portfolios, but their average costs will go up if they
just increase their {current} positions," he said.
   Interest in light metal and mining shares, viewed as
inflation hedges, lasted only through the morning, after
which profit-taking clipped gains.
   Mitsubishi Metal rose 9 yen to 909 yen (6 cents to $6.16),
Nippon Light Metal gained 10 yen to 1200 yen, and Dowa Mining
rose 21 yen to 970 yen.
   Trade centered on Ajinomoto, which according to reports
developed a drug that may prevent the spread of cancer to
different organs in patients who already have the disease.
The drug was allegedly found to be effective on laboratory
rats. The stock soared 400 yen to 2420 yen in heavy volume.
   Oil and refinery stocks including Arabian Oil, Nippon Oil
and Teikoku Oil were higher, with oil prices managing to
maintain higher levels.
   Speculative buying on Jujo Paper continued; the stock rose
30 yen to 1000 yen.
   London dealers said market sentiment there was still
relatively buoyant, and prices merely drifted lower after
several consecutive days' rally.
   One trader said the fall gave market makers an opportunity
to pick up stock as prices fell.
   The market gained support from the disclosure of U.K.
money supply data for June and earnings and employment
figures for May. The data suggested that government efforts
to slow the economy were finally working.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
down 14.7 points at 2387.3, the intraday low. The Financial
Times 30 Share Index dropped 11.9 points to 1888.7.
   Volume was 412 million shares, down from 595.2 million
Wednesday.
   In company news, Great Universal Stores said pretax profit
in the year ended March 31 grew 4.3% to #417.3 million
($757.6 million). Although the result was above market
forecasts of #400 million to #415 million, the market
perceived the results as "dull," according to one dealer. GUS
fell 10 pence to #10.68.
   Unconfirmed rumors that Hong Kong Telecom, which is a unit
of Cable &amp; Wireless, would issue a trading statement, caused
nervousness about C&amp;W shares. The stock dropped 15 pence to
535 pence.
   STC confirmed it is holding talks with Japan's Fujitsu,
which could lead to the latter's taking a majority stake in
STC's computer subsidiary, ICL. STC gained 24 pence to 281
pence.
   An unconfirmed report that Redland would be pulling out of
the plasterboard market, following charges of price-fixing by
competitor BPB and a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, helped boost Redland a penny to 625 pence, after
standing as high as 630 pence.
   Reckitt &amp; Colman sold its fine art and graphics division
to AB Wilh. Becker of Sweden for #60.7 million. Reckitt &amp;
Colman eased 16 pence to #13.09.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Brussels but lower in
Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Milan, Stockholm and Amsterdam.
South African gold stocks closed mixed.
   Also, stocks ended higher in Taipei, mixed in Hong Kong,
Wellington and Singapore, and lower in Seoul, Sydney and
Manila.
