   TORONTO -- The Toronto Stock Exchange said it suspended
development of a comprehensive trading system because of a
drop in trading volume.
   The new system, at an estimated cost of 7 million Canadian
dollars (US$6.1 million), would have replaced four separate
software systems at the exchange. About C$1.5 million has
been spent on the project, which was set to be introduced in
1992.

   Volume at the exchange has dropped this year to an average
of 12,900 trades a day from 1989's daily average of 16,250
trades. The highest turnover in recent years was in 1987,
when the exchange had an average of 22,300 trades a day.
   Olaf Kraulis, vice president of information systems at the
exchange, said work on the new system might resume if the
number of daily trades increases to the 20,000 to 30,000
level.
   Mr. Kraulis said the new system would have the advantages
of higher capacity, reduced maintenance costs and greater
adaptability to new trading rules. The exchange currently
uses separate systems to monitor trades, depending on the
size of the trade and whether it is executed on the trading
floor or on an electronic screen.
