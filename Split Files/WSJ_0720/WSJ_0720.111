   BUDAPEST, Hungary -- When Eastern Europe's new leaders
called in January for the end of Comecon, the Communist
bloc's ramshackle trading system, it seemed that another
Stalinist edifice was about to crumble amid rejoicing.
   But six months into mapping the postComecon world,
anxieties and second thoughts are spreading. Here in Hungary,
which enjoys a head start in cultivating business ties with
the West, companies are bracing for potentially devastating
shocks next year, when Comecon is supposed to be buried so
that free-market trading can come to life.

   The widest grins at Comecon's funeral are likely to be
worn not by the Eastern Europeans but by the Soviets, who
stand to gain as much as $16 billion a year when their former
satellites begin paying real money for Soviet oil and gas.
   Talks with government officials, foreign investors and
company managers here drive home the point that four decades
of enforced economic dependence can't be waved away with a
few bold declarations. Without the Soviet energy supplies
that come into Szazhalombatta via the "friendship pipeline,"
Hungary's already weak industrial base would collapse.
Without Soviet markets, Hungary's enterprises would go
begging for customers -- and won't find many in the West
until their products and production methods are overhauled.
   "I believe the breakup of the Comecon market has come too
soon," says Harold Codd, general manager of Ganz-Hunslet, a
Budapest rail-car manufacturer acquired late last year by
U.K.-based Telfos PLC. "There's nothing to replace it."
   For all the worries, no one wants to return to Comecon's
artificial economy, where a centrally planned quota system
has dictated the exchange of energy supplies, industrial
machines and consumer products -- all for a phony currency
known as the "transferable ruble." What Hungarian officials
and other Eastern Europeans are trying to negotiate with
their Soviet trading partners are ways to soften the impact
of the shift.
   At the moment, though, any grace-period arrangements seem
elusive, and the Eastern Europeans are poised to be the big
losers during the transition. By shifting the East bloc's
trade to hard-currency settlements and world-market prices,
the Eastern Europeans will get hit with a double whammy: They
will pay more for the oil and gas they buy from the Soviet
Union and get less for the consumer products and industrial
equipment they sell.
   David Roche, a strategist for Morgan Stanley Co. in
London, predicts that, all told, the death of Comecon will
mean losses for the Eastern European countries equal to as
much as 4% of their gross domestic products. Meanwhile, the
Soviets should gain 0.5% to 1% of GDP from the oil-price
increases alone. Mr. Roche estimates that the higher energy
costs will slug Eastern Europe "with the equivalent force" of
the world-wide energy crisis of 1973 -- but with the East
bloc countries far less able to withstand the blow than
Western industrial nations were then.
   For the Soviets, behind in payments to Western companies
by about $5 billion, the switch to hard currency and market
prices for oil and gas could be a godsend. But for Hungary,
Poland and Bulgaria -- already reeling under whopping debt
burdens -- the change could chew up around 20% of their
hard-currency reserves.
   The situation raises troubling questions about the money
that Western governments and such international institutions
as the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
plan to pump into Eastern Europe. A hefty chunk of it will
flow out to the Soviet Union in the form of higher energy
payments. "You give {the Eastern European countries} money,
the Soviets will take money out," Mr. Roche says. "There's no
conspiracy; that's just how the trade patterns work."
   Roger Robinson, former director of international economics
for the U.S. National Security Council and now a consultant
in Washington, predicts a "major Soviet siphon effort." He
reasons that "the Soviets are in a payments crisis, and
they're going to ask for cash on the barrel." When the U.S.
Congress comes to ratifying and appropriating funds for the
bank, he argues, it should include "a creative building of
safeguards to take account for an ambitious Soviet strategy
that, more often than not, will be adverse to Eastern
European recovery."
   Though pressures for such safeguards will emerge in
Washington, it will be difficult for Congress to put too many
barriers around the $12 billion reconstruction bank. The
institution has been embraced as the West's main vehicle for
helping the reforming East bloc, and U.S.-imposed constraints
will be unpopular in Europe. It also would be awkward for the
U.S. -- the world's main champion of free-market principles
-- to try to bar the Soviets from charging market prices for
energy.
   U.S. and Eastern European officials are hoping the Soviets
will take a lenient attitude and permit a gradual transition.
Allowing cash settlements at the end of a year, instead of
insisting on regular payments upon delivery, would help. But
such leniency is far from assured.
   This year, Tadeush Teodorovich, head of policy planning at
the Soviet Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, said that
-- theoretically, at least -- the Soviets could replace 70%
of the machines and equipment they buy from Eastern Europe
with superior, and often cheaper, items from the West. The
Soviets won't necessarily do that, but Eastern European
officials say they are still negotiating future trade
arrangements.
   Steven Bina, who manages a Schwinn-Csepel joint-venture
bicycle plant in Budapest, says he has been dropping Comecon
suppliers because "we can buy lower-priced, higher-quality
goods in convertible-currency countries." Once Comecon
transactions switch to hard currency, more East bloc
enterprises are likely to opt for Western suppliers.
   According to Oxford Analytica, a research and consulting
company based in Oxford, England, the shift to hard-currency
trade will cost East Germany about $3 billion a year because
of higher energy costs and lower prices on industrial goods
exported to the Soviet Union. The company estimates that the
change will cost Czechoslovakia $2.7 billion, Poland $2.6
billion, Bulgaria $2.5 billion, Hungary $1.9 billion and
Romania just under $1 billion.
   The costs aren't summed up that simply, of course. East
Germany's escape from Comecon will be made both quicker and
easier by unification with West Germany. By contrast,
Hungary's situation is made more severe by the fact that much
of its hard currency goes to servicing its $20 billion
foreign-debt burden, the biggest per-capita debt in Eastern
Europe.
   Energy dependence varies, but analysts say Eastern Europe
counts on the Soviet Union for about 50% of its energy needs.
Moreover, the Soviet Union provides nearly all of the high
end of the energy mix in Eastern Europe -- namely, its oil
and natural gas. For much of Eastern Europe, this dependence
may increase, since the main alternative is locally mined
brown coal, which emits heavy quantities of sulfur dioxide
and is a major culprit in the region's environmental crisis.
   At the same time, however, the Soviet Union's own
worsening economic chaos has sown fears that the onetime
senior Comecon partner is becoming less reliable. Soviet
energy production has hit snags in recent months, for
example. And East bloc enterprises are anything but
encouraged by this year's spectacle of Western companies
waiting months for billions of dollars owed them by the
Soviets. If the payments crisis persists after post-Comecon
trade begins next year, East bloc companies may find
themselves at the end of what is even now a lengthy queue,
waiting to get paid.
   Ikarus, Hungary's beleaguered bus-making company, is one
of the businesses to get an early taste of life without
Comecon. In January, the Hungarian government, awash in
transferable rubles from the Soviets, ordered a moratorium on
sales for such currency. Buses ready for delivery to the
Soviets piled up, filling all the available space in the
company's sprawling plant at the edge of Budapest. Desperate,
Ikarus arranged to roll hundreds of the vehicles into a
nearby stadium.
   In late February, Ikarus received licenses to sell about
1,000 buses to the Soviets, and the following month it got
permission to sell 1,500. That helped, but overall Soviet
deliveries this year are expected to sink to 4,500 buses from
a recent peak of 7,600 annually. Next year, sales are
expected to drop further. On top of lower volume, Ikarus
officials say, prices will come down as well, although
payments will be made in hard currency.
   As the Soviets cut back orders, other Comecon customers
are looking shaky, too. Leipzig, for example, is slated to
receive its 35,000th Ikarus bus in coming weeks -- an
occasion that the company plans to recognize with an official
ceremony in the East German city. However, Ikarus officials
worry that, with Comecon disintegrating and unification with
West Germany pending, Leipzig authorities may switch to
Volkswagen or Mercedes.
   The only hope, says Jozsef Brumbauer, the company's deputy
director for business development, is to scramble for more
business outside the Comecon alliance. To that end, he
recently helped negotiate $100 million of sales to three
Turkish cities. Ikarus is also shipping 170 buses to China
this year in exchange for Swiss francs, and 500 bus bodies to
Baghdad, where they will be outfitted with separately
purchased engines and parts. Despite these successes,
non-Comecon sales will account for only about 17% of the
company's revenue this year.
   The anxieties at Hungarian enterprises notwithstanding,
official statistics show that the country's non-Comecon
exports jumped 16.5% in the first four months of this year
over the comparable period a year earlier. If the increases
continue, they will help shield Hungary from the fallout from
Comecon's dismembering.
   Istvan Tamas, commissioner for Comecon relations at
Hungary's Ministry for International Economic Relations, is
philosophical about it all. "It's a 40-year relationship that
we have formed," he says. "We have to bear the burden and the
consequences. We don't want to be dependent on a market of
Comecon countries."
