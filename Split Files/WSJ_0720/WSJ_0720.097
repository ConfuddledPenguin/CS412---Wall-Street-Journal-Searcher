   I do not mind when I am told
   They'll have to put my call on "hold";
   It gives me time to think and jot
   Down notes, flesh out a novel's plot,
   Make changes in next week's routine,
   Dust off my phone and fax machine,
   Then savor the true power that's mine --
   To hang up when they're on the line]
   -- Bern Sharfman.

   "Trim it up," I told the barber back when
   I had no bald spots to hide,
   But as the years passed, instructions changed
   To "Just take some off the side."
   -- George O. Ludcke.
