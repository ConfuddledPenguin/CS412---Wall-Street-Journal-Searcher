   HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. said
second-quarter profit rose 5.1%, which was in line with a
company statement this week.
   Profit was $207.5 million, or $1.64 a share, up from
$197.3 million, or $1.50 a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. The profit also reflected an $18 million after-tax
charge that was disclosed in the company's announcement
Monday. The charge was due to a plant closing at the Carrier
Corp. air-conditioning subsidiary.

   Revenue climbed 7.9% to $5.69 billion, from $5.27 billion.
   Earnings benefited from continued strength in the results
of the Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engine division and the Otis
elevator division, the company said, as well as profit
increases for the automotive and Sikorsky helicopter
businesses.
   Besides the special charge, profit at Carrier fell sharply
because of a weak residential air-conditioner market in the
U.S., the company said.
   "We continue to benefit from our strong international
businesses," said Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company said its order backlog on June 30 stood at
$21.1 billion, up from $17.5 billion a year earlier.
   For the first half of 1990, earnings rose 6.5% to $342
million, or $2.69 a share, from $321 million, or $2.45 a
share. Revenue increased 7.8% to $10.49 billion, from $9.73
billion.
