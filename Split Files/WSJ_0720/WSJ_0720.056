   LOS ANGELES -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
filed a motion for civil contempt against Richard G. Reynolds
for failure to comply with a court order to pay $5.7 million
related to his alleged sale of unregistered securities.
   In December, a federal judge here found that Mr. Reynolds,
an investment advisor, and his firm, raised some $3.8 million
from the sale of unregistered securities. Mr. Reynolds, who
has denied the allegations, is appealing the court's ruling
to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

   Pending the outcome of the appeal, Mr. Reynolds and the
SEC stipulated in February that he and his firm, R.G.
Reynolds Enterprises, would disgorge funds raised from the
securities sales, plus interest. The funds were to be
invested in an interest-bearing account until the appeal is
resolved.
   "The defendants have failed to pay any part of the
disgorgement and have not provided the commission with any
evidence demonstrating their ability to pay," the SEC said in
its filing in federal court Wednesday.
   The motion, set to be heard on Sept. 24, asks the court to
find the defendants in contempt and to incarcerate Mr.
Reynolds and/or assess a daily fine against him and his firm
until they pay the $5.7 million. Neither Mr. Reynolds, nor
his attorney, could be reached.
