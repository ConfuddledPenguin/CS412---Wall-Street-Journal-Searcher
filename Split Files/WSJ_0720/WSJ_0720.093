   U.S. Shoe Corp. said falling sales in its once-invincible
Lenscrafters unit will torpedo second-quarter earnings. The
announcement rattled investors who viewed the specialty
optical chain as the one strong horse in the company's
otherwise erratic stable of businesses.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, U.S. Shoe stock tumbled 19%, or $4.25 a share,
closing at $18. The stock plunged 9.2% Wednesday on rumors of
an earnings dropoff.

   Analysts blamed the sales drop on increased competition
among optical retailers. While no other national chain offers
the type of one-hour turnaround service that Lenscrafters
does, more local optical centers are opening up, with
aggressive marketing and discounting strategies.
   Bannus B. Hudson, U.S. Shoe's chairman and chief executive
officer, said Lenscrafters' problems reflect slack demand
industrywide. Despite a strong first quarter, sales for
eyeglasses are down between 14% to 16% for the quarter, he
said. Mr. Hudson had no explanation for the sudden decline.
   "There's nothing going on to explain this," he said. "But
we don't view it as a long-term change in the market."
   Lenscrafters is also in the midst of an expensive
expansion -- it plans to add 100 stores this year -- but Mr.
Hudson said there are no plans to change that plan.
   Whatever the cause, the falloff was a blow to U.S. Shoe,
which has relied on Lenscrafters' double-digit growth over
the past several years to compensate for inconsistent
performance in the company's specialty apparel and foot
divisions. With $520 million in sales last year, Lenscrafters
accounted for 21% of sales and 37% of earnings.
   What's more, Lenscrafters has been the hook upon which
many on Wall Street hung their investments. "Lenscrafters is
the one rock on which the valuation of the company is based,"
said Barry Bryant, a retail analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities. "People who like the stock think Lenscrafters is
worth what the whole company is selling for."
   U.S. Shoe said its second-quarter earnings would be below
the year-earlier net of $2.6 million, or six cents a share.
Those are restated to reflect accounting irregularities
discovered this year in a shoe import unit. Prior to
restatement, the company earned $5.9 million, or 13 cents a
share.
   Besides Lenscrafters, U.S. Shoe is struggling to
revitalize its specialty retail unit, which hasn't kept pace
with such giants as Limited Inc. and Gap Inc. The company
shoe business saw a sharp drop in operating earnings late
last year but rebounded in the first quarter.
