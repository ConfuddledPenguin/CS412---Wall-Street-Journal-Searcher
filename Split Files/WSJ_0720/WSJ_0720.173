   PONTIAC, Mich. -- A federal district court denied First
Federal Bancorp's request for a preliminary injunction that
would prevent federal regulators from appointing a
conservator or receiver for a First Federal subsidiary.
   However, the court continued the temporary restraining
order in effect against the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision until July 27, to give the First Federal
officials time to appeal.

   The bank said it intends to file such an appeal.
   In May, federal authorities placed strict limits on the
lending operations of two First Federal units, Citizens
Federal Savings Bank, of Jacksonville, Fla., and First
Federal Savings Bank &amp; Trust Co.
