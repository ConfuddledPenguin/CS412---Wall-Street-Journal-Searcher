   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is
starting a review of its administrative law proceedings, with
an eye toward speeding up cases.
   The administrative proceedings task force, headed by
Commissioner Mary Schapiro, will take up the agency's inhouse
process of trials against investment advisers, brokerages,
exchanges and others that typically are handled by an
administrative law judge.

   The review comes at a time when the SEC is poised to get
more power to impose administrative actions. The Senate this
week approved a bill giving the agency more leeway to impose
fines on wrongdoers in the securities industry and to block
firms from defrauding investors through cease-and-desist
authority. The House is expected to vote on the measure
Monday. "If we're lucky enough to get the remedies bill, we
are likely to see more administrative proceedings," according
to Ms. Schapiro.
   The panel also is the SEC's response to complaints from
the securities bar that the administrative process is too
slow and occasionally misses the mark badly.
   An American Bar Association task force is drafting
proposals that may recommend that the SEC's system of
administrative law judges doesn't work and should be
abolished, according to a lawyer who has seen a draft. It
isn't clear whether the final ABA proposal will include the
recommendation, he said.
   One Washington lawyer, Arthur Mathews at Wilmer, Cutler &amp;
Pickering, said, "I don't think the commission has paid
enough attention to the role of administrative law judges."
For example, he said he is currently trying a case of
pennystock broker Stuart James Co. before a law judge that is
expected to take a year and a half.
   Ms. Schapiro has spoken in the past about the slow pace at
the SEC. While she said she doesn't have particular rule
proposals in mind, she added that "I want to be sure the
delay -- if it is undue delay -- is not the failing of our
rules."
   She said the study will look at the discovery process, in
which defendants and witnesses offer evidence. It also will
examine whether the SEC is delaying the process of handling
appeals from the law judges.
