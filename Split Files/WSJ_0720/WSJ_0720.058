   Caesars World said it will make an offer next week for
about 2.2 million shares. It said it received a positive
fairness opinion for its financial adviser Wasserstein
Perella &amp; Co.
   A spokesman said Caesars New Jersey was set up by Caesars
World in 1978 as a unit. Later that year the company offered
units and warrants in Caesars New Jersey to shareholders,
retaining about 80%. In 1981, the company bought back enough
shares to increase its stake to its current level of 86.6%.
