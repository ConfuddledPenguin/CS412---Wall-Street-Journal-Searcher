   Western Europe's base petrochemical industry seems to have
touched the bottom of the current business cycle, and it
wasn't as deep a fall as had been expected, industry
officials and analysts say.
   But, they warn, that doesn't mean that it's smooth sailing
ahead for the industry in the 1990s.

   Growing environmental pressures, an increasingly global
marketplace and capacity overhang threaten to erode already
tight profit margins for base chemicals producers over the
next couple of years.
   Makers of major base chemicals, such as ethylene,
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chlorides (PVC),
have seen rapid demand growth and high profit margins since
the mid-1980s, after a painful slump earlier in the decade in
which much capacity was closed.
   High demand and strong global economic growth helped the
industry avoid a major drop after the boom of 1987-88, when
earnings and demand reached record levels.
   "The outlook for 1990-91 is certainly better than we
expected six months ago. The future holds more favorable
possibilities," says a senior official at Shell International
Chemical Co., the petrochemical arm of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group.
   According to price indices of olefins, aromatics,
intermediates and polymers prepared by petrochemical
consultants Tecnon (UK) Ltd., the overall petrochemical index
for the current cycle, which is based on July 1986 equals
100, peaked at 205.66 in November 1988 and began to decline
in early 1989.
   The drop reached a low of 140.38 last October. A slight
recovery is now taking place, with the index at 146.32 at the
end of June.
   Many analysts don't expect prices to soar or drop much
from these levels until the mid-1990s. Some estimates see
total base chemicals demand rising only 11.5% by 1994,
against an estimated rise of about 20.4% in West European
capacity over that period.
   But the main sectors of the base petrochemical industry
haven't all seen the same recovery and don't all enjoy a rosy
outlook.
   Ethylene, the major building block of most petrochemical
products, could suffer from extreme pressure on prices as
major new projects, on starting production, threaten to glut
the market.
   With international demand down, Western European chemical
exports are expected to lag behind import growth.
   One market Western European producers hope to tap is
Eastern Europe, where political changes have opened markets
to Western concerns. Western petrochemical companies hope
growing demand for consumer goods and construction materials
will offset their own nations' sluggish demand.
   But while the potential of the new market is enormous,
many analysts are cautious about the implications of Eastern
Europe as a new trading partner.
   Several of the former Soviet-bloc states have their own
petrochemical plants, but most are antiquated, inefficient
and polluting.
   The other pressing challenge facing the industry in the
1990s comes from growing concern over the environment and
perceptions that chemicals are main contributors to the
depletion of the world's ozone layer.
   "The image of the industry is not a very good one. We have
to demonstrate what we do is good and change the public's
perception," a Shell official says.
   But analysts say it will take major investments to change
the general "anti-chemical" view of the public.
