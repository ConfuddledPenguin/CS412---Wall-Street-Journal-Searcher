   Investors took technology stocks to the woodshed
yesterday, following unexpectedly negative profit news from
Lotus Development and Apple Computer, and nowhere were the
beatings worse than in the over-the-counter market.
   "It was tech-wreck day," said Mitchell Meiser, senior vice
president of OTC trading at Lehman Brothers. Like traders at
PaineWebber in New York and Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, Mr.
Meiser said that sellers dominated activity much of the day
before buyers ventured back in during the afternoon.

   Though the bargain hunters trimmed the day's worst losses,
the OTC market failed to rebound into positive territory as
New York Stock Exchange issues did. The Nasdaq Composite
Index fell to its lowest level since June 27, dropping 2.65,
or 0.58%, to 458.17; it had been down about six points at
midday. Volume was a brisk 182.6 million shares, and
declining stocks outpaced advancing issues 1,116 to 791.
   Lotus was the most active OTC issue, plummeting 6 1/8 to
25 1/8 on 10.3 million shares; it didn't recover much from
its day's low of 24. The Cambridge, Mass., software concern
shocked analysts Wednesday by announcing its third-quarter
earnings may fall short of year-earlier profit.
   Apple Computer also contributed heavily to the
technology-stock dive, falling 2 7/8 to 41 3/4 on 5.2 million
shares; it traded as low as 40. The Cupertino, Calif.,
computer maker cautioned analysts that earnings in its
current fiscal fourth quarter might trail year-earlier
results.
   Though other technology companies didn't join in the
disappointment chorus, their stocks were hammered, too. Sun
Microsystems fell 3/4 to 34; Conner Peripherals lost 1/2 to
29 3/4; Intel sank 3/4 to 47 3/4; Seagate Technology fell 5/8
to 13 5/8, and Autodesk dropped 7/8 to 56 5/8.
   The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which includes most
technology shares, lost 4.07 to 496.59, or 0.8%, recovering
from a midday low of 493.32. That index just reached an
all-time high of 510.61 on Monday.
   Despite the heavy selling, managers of OTC and technology
portfolios at several mutual funds said they don't believe
the day's losses signal a long-term setback for technology
issues.
   "It's a typical correction in the land of technology,"
said Richard Frucci, senior vice president for Putnam
Information Sciences Trust in Boston. "I don't think it will
lead the market down," he said, adding that he still expects
technology issues this year will outperform both the Nasdaq
Composite Index and the larger Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index.
   Alan Radlo, portfolio manager of the $734 million Fidelity
OTC Portfolio, said he believed the day's sellers consisted
of a number of investors who climbed onto the technology
bandwagon late in its mid-year climb to levels well above the
broader Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P indexes.
   "I think it's a setback for people who threw money {at
technology stocks} and didn't know what they own," he said.
"You get these whipsaws and they're expected."
   Like Roger McNamee, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science
and Technology Fund, Mr. Radlo said he was taking advantage
of the overall decline in technology issues to buy some of
his favorite stocks.
   However, analysts said they don't expect Lotus's shares to
bounce back soon. Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Michele Preston said
she expects Lotus to recover next year as it introduces new
versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet software. After yesterday's
drop, she said, the stock is selling at a relatively low nine
times her 1991 earnings estimate of $2.60 a share, which she
lowered yesterday from $2.90 previously. Ms. Preston said she
lowered her Lotus earnings estimate for 1990 to $2.10 a share
from $2.30 previously.
   Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund said in an interview
he is maintaining his "sell" recommendation on Lotus and
doesn't expect the software developer to recover until it
brings out a version of its spreadsheet software that is
compatible with the well-received new Windows 3.0 software
recently introduced by Microsoft. The analyst added that he
doesn't expect Lotus to introduce that product until the
middle of next year and predicts "the market will pass it by"
until the new version is available.
   Despite yesterday's sell-off, analysts say they don't
expect technology stocks to follow the pattern of recent
years: good performance until mid-year, followed by
underperformance for the remainder of the year, caused
largely by a seasonal slowdown in business.
   This year will be different, analysts assert.
   "We're about to embark on one of the most important new
product cycles in the industry's history," said Ms. Preston
of Cowen, though that transition will bring both good and bad
news. Companies such as Apple and Lotus may stumble as they
adapt to the transition, she said. But in 12 to 18 months,
with new products on the market, she expects growth at those
companies to accelerate.
   Leading the way in the new product cycle is Microsoft,
with its much-touted Windows 3.0 software. The software is
based on what is known in computer jargon as "graphical user
interface," or the use of pictures, rather than characters,
on computer screens to guide users.
   "Going from the character mode to the graphics mode is a
big hurdle," agrees Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. He adds
that companies such as Lotus will have to scramble to come up
with products that adapt to the new standards.
   "Rapid and evolutionary and revolutionary changes are
occurring in technology," said Mr. Radlo, adding that he
believes U.S. companies are in the forefront of those changes
and will benefit, particularly next year, as the new products
are introduced and sold overseas.
   But companies with good earnings news weren't punished
indiscriminately. American Ecology rose 2 to 10 1/4. The
Agoura Hills, Calif., waste disposal company Wednesday
reported net income for the second quarter of 57 cents a
share, compared with a loss a year earlier of 94 cents.
   SynOptics Communications rose 1 7/8 to 59 after the maker
of computer network systems surprised analysts with second
quarter net income of 34 cents a share, up from 13 cents a
year earlier.
