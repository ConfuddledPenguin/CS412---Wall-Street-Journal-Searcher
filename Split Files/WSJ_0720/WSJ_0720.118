   NEW YORK -- Citing increased demand for oil-field services
world-wide, Schlumberger Ltd. reported a 14% gain in net
income for the second quarter.
   The oil-field-service company earned $144.8 million, or 61
cents a share, compared with $126.8 million, or 53 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.8% to $1.29 billion
from $1.20 billion.

   The company noted that second-quarter net rose 56%
excluding $35 million of extraordinary and unusual gains from
a year earlier.
   Evan Baird, chairman, said that despite weakening oil
prices, "world-wide oil-field activity continued to increase
as the oil industry remained focused on developing reserves
for the future." He said revenue from oil-field activity rose
21% while the drilling rig count world-wide rose 11%.
   First-half net rose 30% to $273.3 million, or $1.15 a
share, from $209.2 million, or 88 cents a share; revenue rose
to $2.51 billion from $2.38 billion.
