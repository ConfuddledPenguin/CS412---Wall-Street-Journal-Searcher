   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 513 money market
funds rose $3.67 billion to $389.91 billion, in the week
ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 251 general-purpose funds rose $313.3 million to
$134.7 billion and assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose
$361.6 million to $160.04 billion. Assets of 160
institutional funds rose $299 million to $94.81 billion.

   "A sharp jump in institutional assets accounted for most
of the increase in total assets of money market funds," said
Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute. He added that as rates on direct money market
instruments fell, institutional money managers shifted large
amounts of money into money market funds.
   Mutual fund assets were revised for the previous week to
$386.24 billion. The reported increase has been revised to
$3.5 billion and includes one new fund with assets of $531.7
million.
