   The nation's two largest waste-handling concerns reported
higher earnings for the June quarter, with results reflecting
not only the industry's rapid growth, but the problems that
can accompany such expansion.
   Waste Management Inc.'s solid impetus continued in its
second quarter, with earnings and revenue jumping 26%.

   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s profit from continuing
operations in the fiscal third quarter rose 8.8% on a 19%
revenue increase. Net income rose 16% from the year-earlier
period, which included a loss from discontinued operations.
   Browning-Ferris' results came in slightly below what some
analysts had projected, and the company's shares tumbled
$1.875 yesterday in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading, closing at $43.625 on volume of more than 1.1
million shares.
   Waste Management's earnings were largely in line with
investor expectations; its shares slipped 12.5 cents in Big
Board trading, to close at $42.625.
   Both companies have seen the price of their shares climb
more than 35% from the lows of early 1990, and their fully
priced position makes them vulnerable to any investor
skittishness. They have become something of a sacred cow
among institutional investors, particularly the many new
environmental-sector funds.
   Waste Management's net was $178.9 million, or 38 cents a
share, up from the year-earlier $141.9 million, or 31 cents a
share. Per-share figures reflect an increase in average
shares outstanding to 470.7 million from last year's 458
million.
   The Oak Brook, Ill., company's revenue climbed to $1.41
billion from $1.19 billion.
   Waste Management said its domestic and international units
reported improved results. In addition, the company's
77%-owned hazardous-waste and remediation subsidiary,
Chemical Waste Management Inc., which on Wednesday reported
record second-quarter results, made a "strong contribution."
   A spokesman cited several trends behind the company's
improved earnings, including an ongoing corporate
cost-control effort, "expansion of (the company's)
solid-waste services into new markets," and swelling revenue
from international operations, which more than doubled from a
year earlier. At year-end 1989, international operations
represented about 8.5% of Waste Management's revenue.
   At Browning-Ferris, net rose to $82.4 million, or 54 cents
a share, from the year-earlier $71.2 million, or 47 cents a
share -- which included a $4.5 million loss from discontinued
operations. Revenue rose to $767.6 million from $647.4
million.
   The latest earnings were reduced by interest expenses of
$18.4 million, nearly double the year-earlier outlay of $10
million. A spokesman cited the company's 1989 borrowing for
acquisitions under a growth program for the higher interest
payments.
   Those earnings were "a little bit of a disappointment,"
said Richard M. Hanley, an analyst with the firm of McDonald
&amp; Co. in Cleveland.
   Mr. Hanley said the "biggest issue" in the earnings coming
in below expectations was that volumes in the company's
high-margin disposal business -- operating landfills and
charging clients for the right to dump waste -- was down from
a year earlier.
   The downturn was most acute in the company's big Ohio
operation, where they accept loads from Eastern states:
Browning-Ferris "needed to develop a better climate with
regulators and maintain good relations," so they cut back on
the amount of out-of-state waste they accepted at the Ohio
sites, said Mr. Hanley.
   Browning-Ferris conceded that the reduced volume in Ohio
played a role, as did a downturn in the industrial waste
collection and disposal in the economically sluggish
Northeast. But Mr. Hanley said the higher debt load was a
more significant factor, and added that because the company
is currently adding debt much more slowly, future quarters
will see "more of the top-line growth go to the bottom line."
   Also contributing to the Houston company's margin erosion
is its continued expansion in international markets, Mr.
Hanley said. Growth potential is high overseas for such big
players as Browning-Ferris and Waste Management, but profits
are historically thinner and expected to remain so.
