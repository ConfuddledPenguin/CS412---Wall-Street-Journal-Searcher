   U.S. officials and patient advocates stepped up pressure
on Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. over the price and delivery
system for its new schizophrenia drug, Clozaril.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs said it broke off
negotiations to purchase the drug because the company refuses
to allow the VA to provide its own system to monitor patients
who take it. In Chicago, the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill said it asked two other federal agencies to
intercede in a stalemate over the price and delivery of the
drug.

   The actions reflect growing frustration over Clozaril,
known in its generic form as clozapine. The first new
compound for schizophrenia in 20 years, it has proved
successful in treating some patients for whom conventional
medicines have failed. In some cases, patients who have been
confined in state mental hospitals for years have improved
enough on the medicine to be released from wards and hold
jobs. As many as 200,000 patients nationwide, most of them
indigent, are considered to be candidates for Clozaril.
   But the drug, and a monitoring system patients must
purchase along with the medicine, cost $8,944 a year. Many
state mental health and Medicaid programs, as well as the VA,
say they can't afford it. Sandoz, a unit of the Swiss drug
firm Sandoz Ltd., says the proprietary system is necessary to
monitor a patient's blood for a side effect that can be fatal
unless detected early.
   The VA has designed its own monitoring program and says it
won't pay for a service the agency already offers.
   The controversy is getting attention in Congress. Sen.
David Pryor (D., Ark.) is said to be considering legislation
specifically aimed at penalizing companies that require
patients to buy a drug bundled with associated tests or other
services.
   David L. Winter, Sandoz's vice president, scientific and
external affairs, said the company is prepared to consider a
VA monitoring system if it is as effective as the Sandoz
system, and if the VA is willing to accept liability for any
consequences. He said among 4,200 new patients taking the
drug since February, 15 developed a severe version of the
side effect and another 28 had a milder case. All were
reversed when they stopped taking the drug. Without strict
monitoring, such patients could die, he said, and the drug
would likely be pulled from the market.
   "If groups are wiling to discuss indemnification, I think
we might have a different set of discussions in the future,"
Dr. Winter said. "We can't risk this company on this drug."
