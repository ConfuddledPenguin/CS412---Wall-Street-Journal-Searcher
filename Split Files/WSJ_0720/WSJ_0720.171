   Societe Bic S.A. of France, a maker of disposable pens and
lighters, said its first-half consolidated revenue climbed 3%
to 2.9 billion francs ($524.5 million) from 2.82 billion
francs a year earlier.
   Sales by Bic's main operating branch would have been up
7%, after adjustment for changes in exchange rates and group
structure, rather than 3%, suggesting that the firm tone of
the franc against the dollar held back sales growth during
the period.

   Bic didn't announce first-half earnings data. In 1989, it
earned 403 million francs after payments to minority
interests, on revenue of 5.35 billion francs.
