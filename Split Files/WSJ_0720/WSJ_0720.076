   THE EC AND PERSONAL DATA

   The European Community Commission is seeking to protect
personal data against abuse.
   Five EC members -- Italy, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and
Greece -- lack legislation protecting an individual's right
to control personal information in private or public data
banks. Worried that varying levels of protection throughout
the EC may obstruct the flow of information, the commission
has proposed a directive based on a Council of Europe
convention already ratified by seven EC states.
   The directive would give individuals the right of access
to information about themselves and the right to correct
erroneous data. Data relating to race, health or political
opinions would receive extra protection against unauthorized
use.
   Filippo Pandolfi, commissioner of science and research,
says he fears that modern telecommunications technology means
there is a greater risk that sensitive information will be
misused or stolen.
                                                                                                       

   KAIFU ADMINISTRATION IS POPULAR
                                                                                                       

   Public support for the administration of Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu registered 60%, according to a survey
taken last weekend by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. The
support rate for Mr. Kaifu was the second highest in postwar
Japan, ranking after the 60.5% rate of former Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka's cabinet in a 1972 survey. The newspaper said
the support rate for Mr. Kaifu, which was up 3.6 percentage
points from a similar survey in June, was the highest since
he took office in August 1989.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING THE WORLD'S CORAL

   The Swiss-based World Conservation Union will launch a
program to conserve coral at its November meeting in
Australia. The organization said scuba divers and
indiscriminate developers are destroying the world's coral
reefs. It said hundreds of thousands of divers breaking off
small samples and locals harvesting coral to sell are
chipping the reefs away. The organization aims to increase
public awareness of the endangered reefs and the importance
of not buying coral necklaces and shells. It will also try to
encourage countries with reefs to allow diving only in
certain areas or at certain times.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH CAR-IMPORT LIMIT
                                                                                                       

   French Premier Michel Rocard, on a visit to Tokyo,
defended his country's limits on Japanese automobile imports
by saying France's auto makers were too important to
sacrifice, the Japanese Foreign Ministry reported. Mr. Rocard
told Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that both
countries advocate free trade but still hold to some
protectionist policies, ministry officials said. France has
advocated a 10-year transitional period to protect national
car industries before the integrated European market is fully
open to car imports. France limits Japanese car imports to 3%
of its total market.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN-SOVIET VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   South Korea and the Soviet Union have agreed to open the
first regular shipping service between the two countries. The
line will run between the South Korean port of Pusan and
Vostochny in the Soviet Far East, said officials of the South
Korea Maritime and Port Administration. They said the regular
container service is expected to start in October. They said
the accord calls for splitting profits from the operation
equally between the two sides. Only one container ship is
expected to be used initially.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS CIGARETTE RULING
                                                                                                       

   A chain smoker may be addicted, but cigarettes are not
drugs, according to the Swiss Supreme Court. The court's
ruling upheld a lower court that had ordered a
health-insurance company to pay sick benefits to a heavy
smoker who had fallen ill. The insurers had refused payment,
arguing that their contract didn't provide for sick-benefit
money for illnesses caused by abusive use of drugs or
medicines. The high court said while smoking may lead to
addiction, cigarettes cannot be legally categorized as drugs.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN IN ITALY'S MILITARY?
                                                                                                       

   Women could volunteer for service in Italy's military, one
of the last all-male armed forces in Europe, under
legislation approved by a parliamentary committee.
   Increasing numbers of Italian women have been joining
police forces in recent years, but the armed forces have
remained closed to them.
   The bill would open up the Italian services to women as
volunteers and offer careers to them as officers and
non-commissioned officers. However, women would still be
excluded from combat roles.
   The bill, passed by the Senate Defense Committee, must go
before the full Senate and then to the Chamber of Deputies.
It also would reduce the draft for men from 12 months to 10
months and offer alternative service in such fields as civil
defense and environmental protection.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Mikhail Gorbachev's 79-year-old mother, Maria Pantelyevna
Gorbachev, only recently got a color television to replace
her old black-and-white set, bakes her own bread and
complains her son never visits, said an article in the Soviet
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. . . . Roofers working atop
St. Peter's Cathedral in Cologne, West Germany, will get a
bathroom of their own, 200 feet above the nave. The Bild
newspaper said the $160,000 facility, which will have a
heated floor and warm running water, is "Germany's most
expensive toilet."
