   BETHESDA, Md. -- It is a day like many others in the
search for a cancer cure: Steven A. Rosenberg will take two
steps forward and one step back -- if he's lucky.
   At the National Institutes of Health hospital here, the
prominent researcher approaches a middle-aged man sitting up
in bed. "We think we've got some excellent cells for you," he
says. "Yes sir," the patient, a military officer, snaps.
"I've been waiting a long time for this." Nurses hook up
intravenous tubes to the man's arms, and let flow a milky
fluid containing 200 billion immune cells that were harvested
from the man's body and steeped in interleukin-2 to enhance
their cancer-fighting power. (Within two months, his
metastatic melanoma -- a rampant and fatal skin cancer --
regresses 80%. But it doesn't disappear.)

   Down the hall, a young woman and her parents meet with Dr.
Rosenberg, who explains that his unorthodox treatment carries
a 1% mortality risk, with no guarantee her melanoma will
respond. "But I will," she insists. "She's our diamond in the
rough, doctor," her mother appeals, her eyes bright with
pain. Dr. Rosenberg, the chief surgeon at the National Cancer
Institute, accepts the woman into his program. (Her immune
cells mysteriously refuse to grow, however, and the treatment
fails.)
   So it is that, five years after headlines in magazines and
newspapers across the U.S. proclaimed Dr. Rosenberg's work a
"Cancer Breakthrough," there is no breakthrough. Dr.
Rosenberg became something of a media darling when his work
with interleukin-2 became public. But for all the elegant
clinical tests in hundreds of patients, no miracle has yet
been found to stop the nearly 500,000 cancer deaths a year in
this country.
   Instead, there have been slow, incremental steps in
treating the disease. "This is research, not a cure," says
Nathaniel Berlin, a cancer specialist at the University of
Miami Medical School who recruited Dr. Rosenberg to the
National Cancer Institute in 1974.
   Still, while public expectations may have been raised too
high in the early days, Dr. Rosenberg's treatments have
brought undeniable, if modest, help to certain cancer
patients once classed as incurable. They have shrunk tumors
in 25% to 50% of kidney cancer and melanoma patients for whom
all conventional treatments had failed. And though gains are
often partial and temporary, the treatment has caused total
remission in a few patients.
   Now, Dr. Rosenberg is hoping that, later this month, two
new developments will advance his work further. First, Dr.
Rosenberg will ask the National Institutes of Health to
approve a plan to add a new gene therapy to his current
experimental treatments. And second, a Food and Drug
Administration panel will begin considering market approval
for interleukin-2, a protein made by Cetus Corp. that Dr.
Rosenberg uses to propagate immune cells and make them more
potent. So far, it has been approved only for experimental
use; FDA approval would broaden its availability.
   "I'll do whatever it takes," the intense Dr. Rosenberg
says. "It's clear surgery isn't enough," nor are chemotherapy
or radiation, which kill good cells with the bad. His
immunotherapy approach, on the other hand, can rally the
patient's own immune system "and strengthen the body so it
can win the battle against cancer," he insists.
   Dr. Rosenberg's daring experiments and his list of
prominent patients, such as Ronald Reagan, have prompted
admiration and envy from his colleagues. Among his private
patrons is Armand Hammer, the chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., who has backed Dr. Rosenberg's work like a
modern-day Medici, helping make his research the best funded
in the field.
   The 49-year-old physician-researcher, who was born in New
York and educated at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, made his
first crude attempt at immunotherapy in 1968, when he was
still a surgical trainee. While performing a routine
gallbladder operation at the Roxbury, Mass., Veteran's
Administration Hospital, he met a patient who 12 years before
had beaten a terminal stomach cancer. Believing the
spontaneous remission stemmed from a potent immune defense,
he tried giving a second cancer patient a transfusion of the
survivor's blood. The experiment failed. He pressed on with
his research, using pig lymphocytes, or white blood cells,
but this failed, too.
   His immune treatments languished until the 1976 discovery
of interleukin-2 by National Cancer Institute colleagues, and
its large-scale synthesis by Cetus, of Emeryville, Calif.
Armed with the protein, Dr. Rosenberg was able to begin
growing cancer-fighting blood cells by the billions outside
the body.
   However, his first 39 patients on IL-2 alone failed to
respond. Likewise, patients infused with lymphokine activated
killer (LAK) white cells steeped in IL-2 went on to die of
their cancer. But when he put the two agents together in
infusions, there was a different response.
   First, a tumor in a man with colon cancer shrank. Then, in
a case that elated the Rosenberg team, a 34-year-old female
Naval intelligence officer, whose melanoma had shortened her
life expectancy to three months, experienced total remission.
   The treatment was very toxic, however. The Naval
commander, who stands just 5 feet, 2 inches tall, gained 50
pounds of liquid weight from water retention and blacked out
during infusions. "Did you ever see the movie
`Ghostbusters'?" the woman, who asked not to be named, asks.
"Well, I looked like Mr. Stay-Puft, the giant marshmallow
man."
   Less sturdy patients have died from side effects, though
Dr. Rosenberg's claim of a 1% mortality rate compares
favorably with the 5% death rate from some aggressive
chemotherapies. The Naval officer rode out the side effects
and, over the next few months, her tumors began to dissolve.
She recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of her
remission, and is cancer free.
   Another success story is Kathy Donohue, a 34-year-old
professional with advanced lymph cancer. She had failed five
different chemotherapy regimens and was near death when she
came to Dr. Rosenberg as a last resort.
   The IL-2-LAK treatment would take its toll: Ms. Donohue's
blood pressure plunged, she swelled grotesquely and had to be
admitted to intensive care. Yet, she says, "I had the feeling
the {treatments} were working with my body instead of against
it."
   At one point, she was wheeled into surgery grand rounds on
a stretcher to describe to 200 NCI researchers how the
treatment felt. "I told them blinking my eyes was an effort.
It was like being hit by a Mack truck." Over the course of
five treatments, her solid tumors vanished. Because her bone
marrow has never cleared of microscopic cancer traces, she
has had recurrences. But she also experiences longer and
longer well periods between treatments, and at one point went
two years without a recurrence. She surprised everyone.
   "One {family} doctor saw me and said, `You're not dead
yet?'" she says.
   Some researchers, however, have doubts about the
treatment. Most prominent among them is Charles Moertel, a
professor at the Mayo Clinic. His skepticism turned to rage
five years ago during the wave of uncritical publicity about
the work.
   "Anecdotes don't count in our business," he says. "The
American public is very vulnerable, and you've got to have
proof before we can assume a position of advocacy in the
press." He claims he has achieved equally dramatic tumor
shrinkage using the ulcer drug Tagamet. Besides, he adds,
"Tumor shrink rates vary all over the map."
   True enough, Dr. Rosenberg's IL-2-LAK success stories are
rare. Only one patient in 10 enjoys complete remission. And
all too often the recoveries are temporary.
   These limited results led the Rosenberg team back to the
lab to concoct a second-generation treatment. Instead of
simply using common white blood cells steeped in the IL-2
protein, he now goes right to the scene of the cancer to find
a more potent weapon.
   Under this treatment, called IL-2-TIL for
"tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes," doctors harvest cells that
are already fighting the tumor, bathe them in IL-2 until they
number in the hundreds of billions, and then reinfuse them
into the patient.
   In lab and animal tests, this strategy looked 100 times
more potent. But in people, the gains fell short of
expectations. Of 50 melanoma patients put on the treatment,
half showed some tumor shrinkage. However, the rate of
complete remission remains stuck at 10%. Though Dr. Rosenberg
says he is undeterred, even his biggest supporters are
disappointed.
   "I don't think TILs have been as effective as I thought
they'd be," admits Vincent T. DeVita, former NCI director and
now physician-in-chief at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. But he adds: "The worst thing we could do
would be to say it's a failure, and let's drop it."
   "There's something there," adds Ronald Levy, a Stanford
University cancer researcher. "I think everybody wishes the
results were better, given the money and publicity it's
received." But, he says, "we ought to magnify our leads, not
shoot them down."
   Now, Dr. Rosenberg is preparing to face regulatory
scrutiny of a proposed third-generation treatment: gene
therapy. He and collaborator William French Anderson, a
gene-therapy pioneer at NIH, propose to splice into immune
cells the gene for tumor-necrosis factor, a protein that
kills tumor cells. While the agent can cause the body to
begin wasting away when administered generally, the two
believe that having immune cells deliver tumor-necrosis
factor directly to a tumor will prove safer. The team has
done preliminary safety checks, but now wants permission to
begin testing the treatment on cancer patients.
   Already, there has been some outcry from critics of gene
splicing, who worry that the new treatment would prove a
precursor to eugenics, or the attempt to perfect the human
race by influencing genes. Jeremy Rifkin, head of the
Foundation on Economic Trends, has been particularly active
in trying to block experiments.
   Now, the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee will decide later this month whether the
treatments can begin. "I think we'll succeed," Dr. Rosenberg
maintains. "I've never submitted a protocol that wasn't
eventually approved."
   Dr. Rosenberg's old mentor, Dr. Berlin, applauds the
innovation but cautions against high expectations, such as
those that surrounded the first use of interleukin-2. "People
must remember this is research," he warns. "The press has run
farther and faster with this than the science warrants." And
when that happens, he says, "we -- the cancer people --
appear to have promised much and delivered less."
