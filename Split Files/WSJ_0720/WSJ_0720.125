   DETROIT -- A new television ad campaign by the United Auto
Workers portrays American workers, but uses professional
actors instead of actual workers on film.
   The campaign started yesterday, the same day the union
began bargaining with Ford Motor Co. on a new three-year
labor agreement. The union will spend about $3 million over
the next 10 days to run the three 30-second spots in 27
markets around the country.

   Although the union has periodically run "image"
advertising promoting American workers while bashing
corporate America, this is the first time it has done so in
conjunction with the start of negotiations. "It's position
advertising," a union spokesman said.
   Union officials say they didn't have enough time to search
their ranks for real workers to star in the commercials.
Another problem, the UAW said, was negotiating with the
Screen Actors Guild to get approval for non-members to have
parts. The Actors Guild, like the UAW, likes to reserve work
for its members instead of outsiders.
   The UAW's commercials feature only cars built in the U.S.
by the Big Three -- a Chevrolet Beretta, built by General
Motors Corp., a Ford Taurus, and a Jeep Cherokee, built by
Chrysler Corp.
   In one of the UAW's ads, a gray-haired worker wiping off a
wrench says, "We've worked hard to turn things around because
we want the U.S. auto industry to win. But we want to share
in that success with secure jobs for the future."
