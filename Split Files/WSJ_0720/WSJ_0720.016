   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission condemned
legislation passed by the U.S. Senate this week that would
establish a highly restrictive quota system for imports of
textiles, apparel and footwear.
   A statement by the commission called the legislation
"overtly protectionist" and said it raised serious doubts
about chances of reaching an agreement to liberalize trade in
textiles during current negotiations within the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

   The commission said the bill passed overwhelmingly by the
Senate is "diametrically opposite" to the aims of GATT's
negotiating committee on textiles. The commission urged the
U.S. to drop its opposition to plans, supported by many other
GATT members, for the gradual freeing up of textile trade
through the phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which
regulates world trade in textiles.
   The Senate's legislation is opposed by President Bush and
faces an uncertain fate in the House. The bill's sponsors
have said their aim is to maintain pressure on U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills not to allow greater access to the
U.S. textile market in return for concessions from trading
partners in other sectors under discussion in GATT.
   In comments on the GATT talks ahead of important
negotiations next week in Geneva, EC officials said they were
worried about the chances for success in the textiles sector,
given the U.S. approach to the issue. An American plan for a
global quota system to be set up is "totally unacceptable" to
the EC because it would mean the imposition of quotas on EC
textile exports to the U.S., the officials said. The EC's
textile exports to the U.S. currently are unrestricted, and
the EC would never accept the imposition of such curbs, they
said.
   The U.S. plan also would place greater restrictions on
textile trade world-wide, to the detriment of developing
countries, the officials said. This goes against the spirit
of the GATT talks, which are aimed at reducing levels of
protection in 15 different sectors, they contended.
   The officials also expressed worries about talks in
agriculture trade, which have been marked by repeated
confrontations between the EC and U.S. over the level of aid
to farmers, especially export subsidies. The EC is preparing
to make more specific proposals on how to cut farm subsidies,
the officials said.
   But they defended the EC's contention that elimination of
agriculture subsidies isn't realistic. "Farming isn't
industry. You have to have managed markets" to protect
against uncontrollable factors such as the climate, one
official said.
