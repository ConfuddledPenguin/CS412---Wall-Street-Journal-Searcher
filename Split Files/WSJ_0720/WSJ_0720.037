   OAKLAND, Calif. -- American President Cos. said it earned
$1.5 million in the second quarter, a 74% decline from $5.7
million the year earlier.
   The company, which provides container distribution and
transport services, said it lost one cent a share for the
quarter, after reflecting the preferred stock dividend. In
the year-earlier period, the company earned 14 cents a share.

   Revenue for the quarter fell slightly to $511 million from
$530 million, in part because of a decline in the volume of
the company's international business.
