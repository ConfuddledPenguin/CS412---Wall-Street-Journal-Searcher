   The Resolution Trust Corp. opened the books yesterday on
its $3.7 billion portfolio of high-risk "junk" bonds it
inherited from dead and dying savings and loans. It wasn't a
pretty sight.
   Wall Street analysts said the RTC's hoard of junk may be
valued at just 50 cents on the dollar, and taxpayers could
end up paying for $1 billion or more in losses.

   The government agency said it holds 483 different issues
of high-yield junk bonds, all acquired as part of its rescue
operations for insolvent thrift institutions. These junk-bond
holdings include some valued at just three cents on the
dollar, as well as others valued at 80% to 90% of the initial
issue price.
   The RTC's junk portfolio, one of the nation's biggest, is
filled with "poorer quality issues," Joseph Bencivenga, head
of high-yield research at Salomon Brothers Inc., said. "That
was the preference of portfolio managers at savings and
loans. They wanted higher current yield, and it pushed them
into risky paper."
   The RTC's largest three junk issues by face value are
$75.5 million of Cooke Media Group bonds, $66.2 million of
Integrated Resources Inc. bonds and $50.7 million of Busse
Broadcasting bonds. Traders yesterday said that they hadn't
any idea what the value of the rarely traded Cooke Media
bonds might be, but that the Integrated bonds trade at three
cents on the dollar, while the Busse bonds command all of 15
cents on the dollar.
   Nearly all of the RTC's large holdings are bonds
underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the one-time
junk-bond powerhouse that is in liquidation.
   The portfolio does include small positions in bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc., Revlon Inc. and other relatively healthy
companies. "But some of this stuff isn't going to be worth
anything," Mariel Clemensen, director of high-yield research
at Citicorp, said.
   Over time, the RTC is committed to selling off its
junk-bond holdings. Yesterday, though, Elisabeth Spector,
director of the RTC's finance and administration division,
indicated she may take a go-slow approach. "We don't intend
to sell these securities for less than fair value," she said.
"Fair value may not necessarily be reflected by recent sales
or offers."
   A few months ago, market specialists feared that an RTC
liquidation of its huge junk holdings could send prices
skidding even further in the battered junk-bond market. More
recently, though, this concern has lessened, as the junk
market has improved.
   "This is a smarter time for the RTC to be selling than six
months ago," Robert Long, director of high-yield research at
First Boston Corp., said. By his calculations, the total
return on junk bonds, price changes plus interest, was a
respectable 5.5% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, $7.5
billion of junk bonds have been retired this year by the
corporations that initially issued them, while scarcely any
new bonds have been issued. "The supply of junk bonds is
shrinking by more than enough to offset any RTC selling," Mr.
Long said.
   RTC officials had debated for weeks whether publishing the
list would help the government's efforts to sell its junk or
hurt the value of the portfolio by depressing prices further.
Ultimately, officials decided that "we needed to get the
information out for the markets to work," said John Bovenzi,
a top aide to William Seidman, chairman of the RTC.
   The RTC's Ms. Spector also said that if the agency hadn't
published its list, negotiating large sales "would have
required releasing a lot of confidential information" to
prospective buyers that could have given them an edge in the
junk market.
   Now the agency hopes its list will spur interest in the
portfolio. Mr. Seidman said the RTC has received offers for
large chunks of the portfolio from "the big money boys," whom
he wouldn't identify. But he said the agency faces a big
problem: Because so many of the issues are so thinly traded,
it is nearly impossible to gauge the fair value for many of
them.
   Citicorp's Ms. Clemensen estimated that the RTC will do
well to get 50 cents on the dollar for its entire junk-bond
portfolio. Salomon's Mr. Bencivenga was a little more
optimistic: He believes it could fetch $1.9 billion to $2.5
billion, or 50 to 70 cents on the dollar.
   To a small extent, the RTC's $3.7 billion valuation for
its portfolio overstates what thrift institutions initially
paid for the junk bonds. This is because about 15% of the
bonds are zero-coupon issues that don't pay interest. Such
bonds were initially sold to all buyers at a discount to face
value.
   But even after adjusting for the zero-coupon issues, Wall
Street analysts expect that the RTC's eventual proceeds could
fall $1 billion or more below what S&amp;Ls paid for the bonds.
Taxpayers will pick up the difference.
   As big as this shortfall may seem, it is just a small part
of the overall tab for the savings and loan industry's
troubles, First Boston's Mr. Long noted. Junk bonds amount to
just 2% of the RTC's holdings. "At least bonds are liquid,"
Mr. Long said. "You can always find some price for them. The
big challenge will be selling the RTC's real estate."
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, a Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based insolvent thrift that has a junk-bond portfolio
with a book value of $2.9 billion, isn't in the adjacent
table because it is selling the bonds itself.
