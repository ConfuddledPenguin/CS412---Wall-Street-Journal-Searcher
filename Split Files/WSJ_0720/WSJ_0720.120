   NEW YORK -- The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said steps
were being taken to reduce oil flow in the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline to 1.2 million barrels a day from 1.6 million
barrels a day.
   The action came as the company continued to negotiate a
settlement yesterday with the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency in compliance with air quality issues. The
EPA had set a deadline of 12:01 a.m. Alaska time today to
resolve these issues or face the risk of noncompliance,
Alyeska said.

   James Hermiller, president of Alyeska, said the reduced
flow would allow for an orderly shutdown of the entire
pipeline, should that become necessary. The EPA said Alyeska
has "no reason . . . to consider shutting down." Regulators
and oil-industry officials consider a shutdown unlikely.
   Mr. Hermiller said, "We fully expect to reach resolution
of this matter. Conceptually, all concerns by the agencies
have been addressed. What remains is formal approval of these
agreements by midnight tonight."
   The critical step, according to Alyeska, is confirmation
from the Alaska department, which will amend Alyeska's air
quality permits. This would put Alyeska in compliance with
the EPA's notice of violation. Alyeska said it has agreed to
more stringent amendments to its existing permits to bring
the company into compliance.
