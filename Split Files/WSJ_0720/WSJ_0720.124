   WASHINGTON -- Calculating for loans to the thrift-bailout
agency, the Treasury revised the estimate of its borrowing
needs for the current quarter to a range of $62 billion to
$66 billion.
   At its quarterly refunding May 2, the Treasury had
estimated its borrowing needs in the range of $30 billion to
$35 billion for the July-September quarter. Both figures
assume a cash balance of $30 billion on Sept. 30, but the
earlier figures didn't count any lending by the Treasury's
Federal Financing Bank to the Resolution Trust Corp. The RTC
is the agency that is running the savings and loan bailout.

   Yesterday, the RTC Oversight Board said a new operating
plan authorizes it to borrow as much as $34 billion in new
working capital in the July-September quarter. The plan also
authorizes the RTC to roll over $26.6 billion in working
capital borrowed in the prior quarter.
   The Treasury's third-quarter net market borrowing will be
a record if it exceeds $63.3 billion, which was tapped in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
   The RTC uses the working capital to carry the assets of
insolvent thrifts until they can be sold.
   Peter Monroe, president of the Oversight Board, told
reporters that Congress will have to approve new financing
for the thrift bailout operation before the end of the
current session if the thrift rescue is to continue to
proceed at an orderly pace.
