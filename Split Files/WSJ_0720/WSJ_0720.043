   Singapore said that it won't allow correspondents from The
Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review
to cover a meeting of the Asian-Pacific economic forum that
begins in Singapore on July 29. It also said yesterday that
it isn't yet prepared to relax its restrictions on those
publications.
   Singapore has refused to allow the Asian Journal, which is
majority-owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co., the publisher of this
newspaper, to base a reporter in the country since mid-1988.
It has refused to let the Review, which is owned by Dow
Jones, base a reporter there since 1987. Reporters from both
publications also have been denied entry into Singapore for
short-term assignments.

   The government said it has refused to allow reporters from
the Asian Journal and the Review to attend the ministerial
meeting despite a formal request from the U.S. government to
allow the publications access to the international meeting.
The economic forum has been launched by 12 Asian-Pacific
nations to foster economic development in the region. Its
first meeting was in Australia last November.
   "As Dow Jones had not demonstrated full acceptance of
Singapore's position on foreign publications, the government
could not" comply with the U.S. request, Singapore said. It
noted, however, that reporters from the U.S. edition of The
Wall Street Journal and the AP-Dow Jones News Service are
being allowed to attend.
   AP-Dow Jones is a joint venture of the Associated Press
and Dow Jones. Late last year, the Singapore government
denied AP-Dow Jones permission to station a foreign
correspondent in Singapore.
   Both the Asian Journal and the Review have been "gazetted"
by Singapore, with the result that the Asian Journal's
circulation in Singapore has been limited to 400 copies a
day, while the Review has decided to circulate no copies in
the country. The dispute stems from Singapore's insistence
that foreign publications restrict their coverage of
Singaporean affairs.
   Singapore's statement yesterday was accompanied by copies
of correspondence between Dow Jones's vice president,
international, Karen Elliott House, and Singapore First
Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is scheduled to
succeed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew later this year. The
correspondence followed discussions in Washington between the
two over Singapore's restrictions on foreign publications and
Dow Jones's request that both the Review and the Asian
Journal be permitted to cover the economic forum.
   In New York, a Dow Jones spokesman said in a statement,
"For reasons that are unclear, the government of Singapore
has chosen to escalate its dispute with The Asian Wall Street
Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review. The ability of
the Asian Journal and the Review to cover this meeting is
important to these publications and to their readers
throughout Asia. The meeting has nothing whatsoever to do
with their dispute with Singapore. It appears the government
of Singapore is extending its long asserted right to restrict
coverage of Singapore for Singaporean readers to restrict
coverage of international economic meetings for all Asians."
   In its statement, the government said it had been prepared
to consider relaxing the restrictions on the Asian Journal
following meetings and the correspondence between Mr. Goh and
Ms. House. But actions taken by Dow Jones's lawyers in libel
suits brought by Prime Minister Lee against Dow Jones and
Peter R. Kann, Dow Jones's president and chief operating
officer, blocked such consideration, it said.
   Prime Minister Lee is suing Mr. Kann; Barry Wain, the
Asian Journal's editor; and Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia)
Inc. for libel in Singapore and Malaysia. He also is suing
Mr. Kann and Review editor Philip Bowring in Malaysia. The
suits stem from comments by Mr. Kann, which were reported in
the Asian Journal and the Review, criticizing a Singapore
court's libel judgment against the Review in a case brought
by Prime Minister Lee.
   Singapore's government stressed that the restoration of
the two publications' unrestricted status in Singapore hinges
on Dow Jones's affirmation of Singapore's policy on foreign
publications. The policy includes requirements that foreign
news organizations "report events in Singapore as outsiders,
for outsiders," and states that "it is not their
responsibility to protect Singapore citizens against what
they may perceive to be an authoritarian government, or to
ensure the functioning of a `healthy' democracy in
Singapore."
