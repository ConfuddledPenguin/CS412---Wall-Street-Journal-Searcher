   WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan announced a
new policy that will allow the government to pocket a greater
share of tourist dollars spent on food, lodging and other
concessions at national parks.
   The department intends to raise the franchise fees that
private companies pay the government for the right to operate
concessions ranging from luxury hotels to souvenir stands to
canoe rentals at parks, historical battlefields and
recreation areas managed by the National Park Service.

   There have long been complaints that some of the fees paid
by more than 560 private contractors are too low. At Yosemite
National Park in California, for example, a subsidiary of MCA
Inc. pays the government only 0.75% of gross revenue from
concessions that yielded it revenue of about $85 million last
year. Its franchise fee, among the lowest, hasn't been raised
since 1963, although the company currently is negotiating a
contract with a higher fee.
   Mr. Lujan also said he will seek legislative changes to
inject greater competition in the awarding of concessions
contracts.
   The move was hailed by conservation groups that have been
critical of monopolistic concessions contracts they feel were
too favorable to private concerns. "For too long now, too
many concessionaires have been getting a sweetheart deal,"
said Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and
Conservation Association. He called Mr. Lujan's new policy
"right on target."
   In 1988, private companies took in about $500 million from
providing services at the parks, of which the government
received $15 million.
   The average franchise fee is now 2.5% of gross receipts.
As contracts come up for renewal, Mr. Lujan said, he hopes to
raise the fees to as much as 22%, depending on the size and
profitability of the concessionaire. The formula for setting
a new fee is to be worked out on a contract-by-contract basis
that provides contractors "a reasonable opportunity for
profit." About 25% of the contracts outstanding come up for
renewal in the next few years.
   To increase competition in contract renewals, Mr. Lujan
said he will push to change provisions in current law that
give contractors preferential rights to renew their
contracts. He also indicated he favors changes to keep
concessionaires from demanding such steep compensation for
improvements they have made on the premises that it blocks
new bidders from buying out the interests.
   The secretary didn't take any action on a National Park
Service recommendation to reduce concessionaires' ownership
interest in park facilities such as hotels and restaurants
and eventually turn over ownership to the government. A
spokesman said the recommendation is still under
consideration.
