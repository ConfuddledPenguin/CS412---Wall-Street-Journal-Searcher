   Last month, USA Today carried a major article reporting
that a call-in poll found widespread support for troubled
tycoon Donald Trump. Yesterday, the newspaper said, Oops,
never mind.
   The article last month reported that 81% of the 6,406
50-cent calls to a 900 number agreed with the statement
"Donald Trump symbolizes what makes the USA a great country."
The article carried a three-column picture of Mr. Trump, with
the headline "You like him] You really like him]"

   Yesterday, however, Gannett Co.'s USA Today reported that
"you" turned out to be one person. It seems financier Carl H.
Lindner Jr. stacked the deck in Mr. Trump's favor.
   Fully 72% of all the calls in the poll came from two
numbers at Great American Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Mr.
Lindner's American Financial Corp. Without those calls, the
results would have been solidly against Mr. Trump -- who said
at the time that he was "greatly honored" by the tally and
looked forward to "justifying the public's confidence."
   The initial USA Today article had cautioned that the
calling patterns suggested someone might be stuffing the
ballot box and said that such unscientific polls were
"strictly for fun, anyway." Peter S. Prichard, editor of USA
Today, said in an interview that the skewed results would
make the paper more careful about how it handles call-ins in
the future, especially if anything unusual appears in the
results. He added, though, that the paper, which has done
quite a few call-ins, still feels that they "are a good way
to involve readers and see what their sentiments are on some
issues."
   Yesterday's article quoted a spokeswoman for Great
American Insurance as explaining the calls by saying, "Trump
is one example of the entrepreneurial spirit. . . . We
disapprove of an attitude that we think is harmful of that
entrepreneurial spirit and disapprove when the media and
other parties continue to discredit unnecessarily the people
that are visible leaders of this country."
