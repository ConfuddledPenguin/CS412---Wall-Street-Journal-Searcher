   Volkswagen AG Chairman Carl Hahn said the West German auto
maker's first-half earnings slightly exceeded the record
year-earlier profit of 403 million marks ($244.5 million),
but he didn't provide specifics.
   At the annual meeting, Mr. Hahn also said sales of the
Volkswagen, Audi and SEAT brands in the six months all
surpassed levels in the 1989 first half.

   Volkswagen's first-quarter profit rose 5.5% to 191 million
marks. Net income for 1989 climbed 33% to 1.04 billion marks.
   Mr. Hahn said that world-wide sales in the 1990 first half
rose 1.5% to 1.55 million vehicles, and that the order
backlog is "unusually large."
