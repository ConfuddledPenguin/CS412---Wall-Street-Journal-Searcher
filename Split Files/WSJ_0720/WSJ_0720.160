   Iraq's increasingly aggressive stance is raising new
questions about next week's meeting of OPEC oil ministers and
the organization's future leadership.
   Until this week, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries midyear conference, to begin Thursday in Geneva,
had been expected to be short and tension-free. The 13 oil
ministers had been expected to rubber-stamp a July 10
proposal by five Persian Gulf producers, including Iraq, that
the two main quota cheaters in their ranks cut output, given
the promise of higher allotments later.

   The overproducers are Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
and, according to monitors of OPEC production, both are
already trimming their output. Still, President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, who has been bitterly accusing the two
countries of overproduction for several months, threatened
this week to use force against them unless they mended their
ways.
   By yesterday, President Hussein's escalating campaign
against his chief target, Kuwait, had triggered a flurry of
charges and countercharges between Baghdad and Kuwait City,
centering on their long-running border dispute.
   Kuwait officially sought the support of its Arab
neighbors, while Iraq's parliament took steps to name Saddam
Hussein president for life. And OPEC watchers conceded that
the outlook for next week's meeting now is less than clear.
   But what is clear, oil specialists said, is that through
his latest hardball tactics, President Hussein is reshaping
alliances and expanding his influence in OPEC, a longstanding
goal, and that this signals higher world oil prices ahead.
   "This is the most important development for the oil
industry since the 1979 Iranian revolution," Bryan Jacoboski,
senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said. "Iraq has taken
OPEC's political leadership away from Kuwait, which had taken
it from Saudi Arabia, and the impact will be felt well beyond
next week's meeting."
   Kuwait essentially had stood alone in OPEC in recent
months -- if not recent years -- in stubbornly holding to its
position that low oil prices were the only way that the
Persian Gulf producers holding the bulk of the world's oil
reserves could assure markets of their petroleum in the
decades ahead. Saudi Arabia's oil authorities still may hold
similar views, but their public posture in recent months has
been to support higher oil prices. It was Saudi Arabia that
hosted the early-July meeting of the five Persian Gulf oil
ministers and then announced the plan to push up the OPEC
benchmark price from this year's low of $14 a barrel to at
least $18.
   Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's. But
the eight-year war with Iran delayed Iraq's plans to build up
its oil-producing capacity beyond the prewar peak of 3.5
million barrels a day. Expansion goals still are sidetracked,
because of the lack of capital and the pressing need to
rebuild the war-damaged economy. So Iraq, which has long
wanted higher oil prices, has been blaming Kuwait and the UAE
for engaging in "economic warfare," by causing the world oil
glut, depressing oil prices and costing Iraq about $14
billion in lost revenue this year.
   Ironically, in his search for higher oil prices, President
Hussein has drawn a staunch new ally, his old war foe Iran.
Some months ago, the oil ministers of Iraq and Iran
discovered that they shared a common pricing goal. Now,
though they may differ on other matters, the three
powerhouses of the Persian Gulf -- Iraq, Iran and Saudi
Arabia -- are linked in a push for higher oil prices.
   But President Hussein is forging a bigger coalition than
that in OPEC. Except for the handful of remaining Persian
Gulf producers, almost every member of OPEC wants higher oil
prices. Many of these countries, such as Indonesia, already
are producing at capacity. The only way they can increase
revenue is through higher petroleum prices.
   Iraq and Iran recently agreed to support jointly an
eventual increase in the OPEC pricing target to $25 a barrel
from $18. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, returned
home after visiting the UAE, Algeria and Libya in his push
for higher prices. He told reporters in Tehran he expects the
Geneva talks to focus on ways to lift the OPEC benchmark to
$20.
   By any measure, the Iraq-Iran-Saudi trio already has
succeeded in getting oil prices higher. The OPEC benchmark,
which is based on a basket of seven crudes, is up at least $2
a barrel from the year's low to $16. In the U.S., where oil
prices traditionally are higher than the OPEC average, crude
oil futures rose again yesterday, with the August crude up 44
cents to $18.99 a barrel.
   Oil specialists generally suggest there is still room for
West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the U.S. benchmark crude, to
rise some more, despite the burdensome level of oil
inventories. "We expect the price of WTI to slowly advance
toward a maximum of $20 to $22 a barrel in the upcoming
winter season," reports Stanford Field, an oil consultant
with SRI International of Menlo Park, Calif. Paul Mlotok, an
oil economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., also believes that
oil prices may have bottomed, and that WTI should be back
over $20 a barrel before year end.
   It was Mr. Mlotok who coined the phrase "Saddam Factor" to
explain the new realities in OPEC. And Petroleum Politics, an
industry publication, reports that President Hussein's oil
strategy began to take shape as long ago as February, "when
it became obvious that only a concerted drive to force up oil
prices would save Iraq from an extended economic crisis."
PaineWebber's Mr. Jacoboski likens the strategy to that of
the state oil agencies that enforced restraints on U.S. oil
production to prop up the price for decades. "Saddam
Hussein," he says, "is the new Texas Railroad Commission of
OPEC."
