   NEW YORK -- A federal judge overseeing Integrated
Resources Inc.'s bankruptcy-law proceeding temporarily
blocked efforts by CRI Inc. to buy four real estate
investment partnerships managed by Integrated.
   At a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Judge Howard C.
Buschman III granted Integrated's request for a preliminary
injunction delaying two lawsuits CRI filed in Delaware and
California state courts against Integrated -- which manages
more than 600 partnerships -- in connection with CRI's
proposed bid for the partnership interests. CRI is seeking to
gain control of the interests by approaching the investors in
the limited partnerships directly, outside a court-approved
auction process to sell the interests.

   The order effectively gives Integrated, which has an
agreement pending to sell its interests in the partnerships
directly to Krupp Cos., until Aug. 1 to "straighten out the
deal with Krupp," Judge Buschman said. The judge indicated a
condition that was added to the agreement with Krupp after
CRI announced its bid would have to be addressed.
   Although Judge Buschman said "it would be a detriment to
other bidders {in the auction} to renegotiate the terms after
the bids are in," he said it would be "appropriate" to
address the limited issue of renegotiating that condition.
   As part of the court-approved auction, Integrated agreed
June 7 to sell its general partner interests in its American
Insured Mortgage Investors series of limited partnerships to
Krupp for $45 million. But after CRI's bid was announced, a
condition was added to Integrated's agreement with Krupp that
CRI's proposal be ended and its lawsuits dropped. Integrated
announced that accord June 15.
   However, on June 12, CRI, a real estate syndicator based
in Rockville, Md., filed a proposal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer to swap interests in two of its
real estate ventures for the AIM partnership interests.
   Allan M. Pepper, an attorney for Integrated, argued that
CRI's actions would undermine Integrated's efforts at
reorganization and the auction process. He said the company
now will move to develop "a strategy toward a closing with
Krupp."
   Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman, said the company
plans to seek a permanent injunction to block CRI's proposed
exchange offer. Mr. Weinroth said Integrated was encouraged
by the judge's statements "that the facts presented raised
the inference that CRI may have intentionally interfered"
with the court-approved auction.
   Larry Gerber, president of Krupp, said it plans to "go
forward" and that Krupp has had discussions with Integrated
about an amendment to the purchase accord.
   Attorneys for CRI wouldn't comment.
