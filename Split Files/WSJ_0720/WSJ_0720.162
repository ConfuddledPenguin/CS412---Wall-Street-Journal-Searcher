   WASHINGTON -- Last year, with the savings-and-loan
industry seemingly fatally tainted, the once-mighty U.S.
League of Savings Institutions considered dismantling its
political-action committee.
   It's a good thing the industry's lobbying arm didn't take
that step. At least, it's a good thing for a lot of
congressmen and senators. For despite the industry's
financial straits, the Keating Five scandal and public
criticism of the league itself as a symbol of excessive
influence peddling, incumbents are still eagerly lining up
for campaign contributions from its PAC this campaign season.

   Already, it has contributed $233,174 to 1990 congressional
candidates, a sum it expects to grow to $500,000 by Election
Day. "We're still being solicited," says Frederick Webber,
the league's president. "People aren't bashful about asking
us for money." At least two or three fund-raising
solicitations from members of Congress arrive each day at the
league's headquarters near the White House.
   Even as lawmakers stampede to distance themselves from the
savings-and-loan crisis, many are still raking in PAC
contributions not just from the league but from the entire
industry. Some of those who are filling their campaign
coffers with S&amp;L-related contributions are incumbents whose
own 1990 re-election drives are being threatened by the
partisan mudslinging over the S&amp;L issue.
   "Basic political sense would tell congressmen to turn off
the S&amp;L faucet for the duration of scandal," says Larry
Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia who has
written a book about PACs.
   So far in the 1989-90 election cycle, political-action
committees associated with thrift interests have contributed
more than $650,000 to congressional candidates, according to
Federal Election Commission records and data compiled by
Common Cause. The vast majority has gone to incumbents, both
Democrats and Republicans. By Election Day, the contributions
are likely to reach $1 million, according to several industry
sources.
   That's down from previous elections. In the 1987-88
election cycle, thrift PACs kicked in a record $1.8 million
to congressional campaigns. (The league accounted for nearly
one-third of this amount.) In 1985-86, they gave $1.6
million.
   But the decline this time isn't nearly as substantial as
some expected, given the number of S&amp;L failures, the 25%
reduction in the league's membership over the past 20 months
and, most of all, the political taint that now accompanies
such contributions.
   One embattled incumbent still accepting thrift money is
Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.). Late last year, Rep. Neal, a
senior member of the House Banking Committee, returned $3,350
of campaign contributions that he had received from Charles
Keating Jr., the controversial former owner of Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan, and his associates.
   Ken Bell, Mr. Neal's GOP opponent, has also hammered the
congressman for taking in $47,100 in thrift PAC contributions
during the 1980s and for voting with the industry on key
legislation. "It's going to be the major issue in the
campaign," says Mr. Bell. Mr. Neal's district was also
blanketed by Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby,
with stinging advertisements over the July 4 holiday week
that linked the S&amp;L scandal directly to campaign
contributions and highlighted his PAC receipts from special
interests.
   But all that hasn't stopped the congressman from accepting
$3,500 from the league's PAC for his 1990 campaign. Rep. Neal
calls the Common Cause ads "scurrilous," saying the
thrift-related contributions he has received over the years
represent "a tiny percent" of his overall fund raising. He
adds that several healthy S&amp;Ls in North Carolina belong to
the league and that to turn down the group's donation for
this campaign "would be saying something was wrong with our
local S&amp;Ls." He says: "They are decent people. I hate to see
them smeared and tarred with the same brush as some crook out
there."
   Besides Mr. Neal, two other banking-panel members who are
perceived as being vulnerable on the S&amp;L issue have also
accepted contributions from the savings league and other
thrift PACs for their 1990 campaigns. Rep. Frank Annunzio
(D., Ill.) has received $4,500, and Rep. Doug Barnard (D.,
Ga.) has taken in $2,600. In addition, Rep. Charles Pashayan
(R., Calif.), whose past contributions from Mr. Keating are a
hot issue in his race, has received $1,600 from thrift PACs.
   None of the Keating Five, the group of senators in trouble
for their contributions from and intervention on behalf of
Mr. Keating, are up for re-election this year. Three of them,
however, have accepted small contributions from thrift PACs
for their next campaigns. Sens. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.)
and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) have each received $2,000
from S&amp;L PACs, while Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) has taken
$500.
   Murray Flander, Sen. Cranston's press spokesman, says the
senator is deliberately not doing much fund raising from S&amp;L
PACs for his 1992 election, despite having taken heavy
thrift-related contributions in the past. "It's not an
opportune time," says Mr. Flander, who frets that the senator
might suffer political embarrassment if a thrift contributed
to his campaign and subsequently failed.
   Like Sen. Cranston, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.)
appears to have undergone a sudden conversion. The Banking
Committee member is eschewing thrift PAC contributions for
his 1990 campaign, and earlier this week led a protest march
to the league's office in Chicago. "The league was targeted
because it represents an industry rife with problems," says
Mr. Kennedy's press spokeswoman, Sue Wood. In 1988, however,
Rep. Kennedy took a $1,100 campaign contribution from the
league's PAC. "If we'd known in 1988 what we know now, we
wouldn't have taken money from the league," says Ms. Wood.
   While the U.S. League of Savings Institutions is still
making money available to those who will take it, at least
one of its components isn't following suit. Earlier this
year, the Iowa League of Thrift Institutions, the league's
Iowa affiliate, decided not to make any PAC contributions to
congressional candidates.
   "With the thrift crisis and all the allegations about
campaign contributions, we've abandoned our federal PAC and
joined the efforts of Common Cause to achieve PAC reform,"
says Kent Klopfenstein, a member of the Iowa group.
