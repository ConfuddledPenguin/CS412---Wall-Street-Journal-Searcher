   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -- Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. said a
federal appeals court granted its motion for an expedited
appeal of a preliminary injunction that two weeks ago halted
sales of its Game Genie videogame toy.
   Nintendo of America Inc., a unit of Japan's Nintendo Co.,
sued Galoob in June, complaining that the genie game
infringes on a Nintendo copyright and that it makes Nintendo
games too easy to play. Nintendo, which recently has sued
other companies for alleged copyright infringements, worries
that its customers will get bored with its games if they are
too easy to play.
