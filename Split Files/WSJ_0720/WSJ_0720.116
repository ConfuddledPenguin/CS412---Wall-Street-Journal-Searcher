   Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago, hurt by special charges
associated with two recent adverse court rulings, reported a
second-quarter net loss of $378.4 million, or $1.88 a share.
In the year-ago period, the utility had net income of $152.6
million, or 61 cents a share.
   Revenues, adjusted to reflect court-ordered rate cuts,
fell to $846.4 million from $1.31 billion.

<TEXT>
   A rate rollback and refund, ordered by the Illinois
Supreme Court in May, generated an after-tax provision of
$253 million, or $1.19 a share.
   Disallowances and a refund ordered in June by the Illinois
Appellate Court, concerning Commonwealth's Byron 1 nuclear
plant, required a charge of $208 million, or 98 cents a
share, in the latest quarter.
