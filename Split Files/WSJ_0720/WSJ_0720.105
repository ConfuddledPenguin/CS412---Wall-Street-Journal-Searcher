   LONG ISLAND LIGHTING Co. (Hicksville, N.Y.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it raised its ratings on $4.3
billion of securities of this utility. The rating concern
cited a rate settlement, a financial restructuring and the
removal of potentially substantial liabilities related to
charges filed against Lilco under anti-racketeering statutes.
Moody's upgraded its ratings on Lilco's first mortgage and
general and refunding bonds to Baa-3 from Ba-1; debentures
and unsecured pollution-control bonds to Ba-1 from Ba-2; and
preferred stock to Ba-2 from Ba-3.
