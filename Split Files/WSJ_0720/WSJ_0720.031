   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. reported second-quarter
net income of $44.8 million, or 54 cents a share, an increase
of 7% from year-earlier net of $42 million, or 58 cents a
share.
   MCA said the fall in per-share profit results from the
issuance of about 10 million shares in connection with the
acquisition last March of Geffen Co., which MCA says cost it
$435 million.

   Separately, MCA said it agreed to acquire a minority stake
in Harvey Comics Entertainment. The Santa Monica, Calif.,
company publishes cartoon characters including Casper the
Friendly Ghost and Richie Rich.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but closely held Harvey was
purchased last year by an investor group led by 25-year-old
Jeffrey A. Montgomery for $8 million; Mr. Montgomery is the
son of Great Western Financial Corp. Chairman James
Montgomery. MCA's stake is said by individuals close to the
transaction to be in the 20%-30% range. MCA's Universal
Pictures is in talks to develop a film based on the Richie
Rich character and the company said it would attempt to
exploit Harvey's characters in film, television, home video
and theme parks.
   MCA revenue increased about 15% to $949.9 million from
$828.3 million. Revenue from theatrical films provided the
biggest boost, resulting from the successful film releases
"Bird on a Wire" and "Back to the Future III" and from home
video revenue.
   Operating profit was down slightly, primarily owing to
MCA's share of a $6 million loss registered by Cineplex Odeon
Co., the movie theater chain of which MCA owns a 49% stake.
This was somewhat offset by lower interest expenses owing to
lower rates.
   Theme park revenue was down, partly because last year's
quarter saw the opening of the popular "Earthquake"
attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. Results from
Universal Studios Florida, which opened in June and is
getting off to a slow start because two of the major
attractions haven't opened as planned, weren't included in
the second quarter results. Operating profit improved at the
company's New York-area television station, WWOR, and its
50%-owned USA cable television network, but pay television
suffered from the lack of a contract for certain new films.
Those films have been sold directly to CBS Inc.'s television
network and the ensuing revenue will show up next quarter, a
company spokesman said.
   "There's a lot to look forward at this company," said
analyst Lisbeth Barron of S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., citing improved
performance in the music division when the Geffen acquisition
takes hold next year, and the Florida theme park. She said,
"it's got the most potential of any company in the
entertainment industry" and called the stock an "attractive
buy within a few points of 50 {dollars a share}."
   MCA shares closed yesterday at $52.25, up $1.25.
