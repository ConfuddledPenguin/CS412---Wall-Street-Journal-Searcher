   First Financial Management Corp., Atlanta, said it signed
a definitive agreement to buy Zytron Corp. from Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. for $82.5 million.
   The financial-services company said Zytron, a Menlo Park,
Calif., company that provides data-imaging products and
services, had 1989 revenue of about $75 million. Among other
things, Zytron offers laser printing services and specialized
printing and mail services.
