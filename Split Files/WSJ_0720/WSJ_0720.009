   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Humana Inc. said a tax refund will
boost net income for its fourth quarter ending Aug. 31 by $19
million, or 18 cents a share. The health-care company had
year-earlier profit of $66.7 million, or 66 cents a share.
   Humana said it received about $68 million in settlement of
all contested issues with the Internal Revenue Service
through 1986. The payment consisted of a refund of about $31
million in federal income tax and $37 million in interest.
