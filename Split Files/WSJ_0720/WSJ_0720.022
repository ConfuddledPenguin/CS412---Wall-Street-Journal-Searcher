   WASHINGTON -- Treasures sometimes turn up in the most
unexpected places.
   In U.S. Government Bookstores, for example, nestled on the
shelves among "Mineral Facts and Problems" and "A Basic Guide
to Exporting," is a 520-page tome entitled "Respectfully
Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations Requested from the
Congressional Research Service."

   The book contains 2,100 quotes on topics ranging from
"Abolition of slavery" to "Youth" that the Library of
Congress has researched over the years. The research service
says it gets more than 1,500 congressional inquiries of all
types daily, including requests to verify statements for use
in campaign speeches and debates in Congress.
   Some quotes offer insight into an issue that is on
everybody's lips today: taxation. "A government which robs
Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul,"
quipped George Bernard Shaw. And there's notable commentary
on the U.S. legislative process. "Congress is so strange. A
man gets up to speak and says nothing. Nobody listens -- and
then everybody disagrees," observed Boris Marshalov, a
Russian visitor.
   There are classics, such as President Truman's account of
Joseph Stalin's famous question to Winston Churchill: "How
many divisions did you say the Pope had?" And there are
boners, such as the remark Alan Greenspan made in 1974, more
than a decade before he became chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board: "Everybody is hurt by inflation. If you really
wanted to examine who percentage-wise is hurt the most in
their incomes, it is the Wall Street brokers."
   Trivia buffs will be able to annoy their friends with some
of the book's findings. For instance: Pro football coach
Vince Lombardi said, "Winning isn't everything; it's the only
thing." Right?
   Wrong. Red Sanders, a Vanderbilt University coach, said it
and didn't get the credit. But as President Kennedy, not
President Carter, said, "Life is unfair." (Mr. Carter's
observation was that there are "many things in life that are
not fair.")
   The quotes indicate that there's not much said that's
really new. The library's researchers traced the modern
commandment "Do your own thing" to the 14th-century writer
Geoffrey Chaucer, who put it this way: "Dooth with youre
owene thyng."
