   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. said it and members of the
Bombardier family agreed to issue 7.5 million common shares
to the public for a total of about 146.3 million Canadian
dollars (US$126.3 million).
   The company said it will offer five million Class B
subordinated voting shares, and the Bombardier family will
sell 2.5 million Class B shares, all at C$19.50 a share.

   Bombardier said proceeds of about C$93 million from the
company's sale of the five million newly issued shares will
be used to reduce debt and to increase working capital.
   At last report, Bombardier had total debt of about C$222
million and C$504 million in shareholders' equity. Some
analysts said they had not expected the company to issue more
equity.
   The transportation equipment manufacturer has made several
major acquisitions in recent months, including the $75
million purchase of Learjet Corp. from Integrated Resources
Inc. announced in April.
   The Bombardier family's voting control of the company
doesn't appear likely to be affected by their sale of the
shares. At last report, the family held 78.7% of the Class A
shares, representing a voting stake of 67%.
   A preliminary prospectus is expected to be filed with
regulators Monday. The share issue is subject to board and
regulatory approvals. Toronto-based securities dealer Scotia
McLeod Inc. will be the issue's lead underwriter.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Bombardier's Class B shares closed at C$19.75, down 62.5
Canadian cents. Its Class A shares closed at C$19.875, down
50 Canadian cents.
