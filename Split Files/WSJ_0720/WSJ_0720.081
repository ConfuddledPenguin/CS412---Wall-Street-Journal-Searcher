   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- A year ago, Lotus Development Corp.
finally delivered a long-delayed improved version of its
best-selling 1-2-3 software, appearing to end the industry's
longest-running soap opera. Troubles over? Not exactly.
   The old version, 1-2-3 Release 2.01, was used by an
estimated six million customers when Lotus introduced the
new, improved Release 3.0 version last June. But older, less
powerful PCs couldn't use Release 3.0, so Lotus came out with
another updated version, Release 2.2, a month later.

   Then two months ago, it said it will come out with yet
another new version, Release 3.1, which will offer fancier
printing capabilities that customers wanted but which Lotus
didn't include in its Release 3.0 product.
   Confused? So are a lot of Lotus's customers. Lotus's
effort to provide a different product for everyone, while
perhaps sounding good in theory, has prompted many to just
sit tight with their old program. Lotus's strategy and its
results with customers point up the marketing problems that
dominant companies have in defending their market positions.
   Until this week, everything looked fine, with Lotus
showing spectacular earnings gains for the past four
quarters. But late Wednesday, it disclosed that earnings may
decline in the current quarter, and that it isn't on the
strong growth path most analysts had forecast. Executives
conceded for the first time that competitors' spreadsheets
are cutting into its dominant market share.
   That announcement caused Lotus's stock to take a terrible
beating yesterday. It plummeted $6.125 to close at $25.125 in
national over-the-counter trading. More than 10 million
shares changed hands as technology investors bailed out of
Lotus and moved on to faster-growing PC software stocks. To
many, Lotus now looks like a mature company nursing a cash
cow without the prospects for spectacular growth that other
personal-computer software firms offer. Despite repeated
efforts to move beyond spreadsheets, Lotus still lacks any
other fast-growing programs with significant sales.
   Lotus became the paradigm of an explosive growth company
after it introduced 1-2-3 in 1983 and racked up $63 million
in sales in its first year. Until 1988, it remained the
biggest company in the PC software industry, with 1-2-3
accounting for two-thirds of its sales. Although far
surpassed in size and growth rate by Microsoft Inc. in recent
years, it remains No. 2 in the industry. And 1-2-3, by most
estimates, still captures 60% to 70% of all spreadsheet
revenue.
   However, at a time when the PC business is booming and
many other software companies are soaring, Lotus is now
floundering. Even beyond the issue of quarterly earnings,
"there are many questions about Lotus," says David Readerman,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   For one thing, its core strategy of introducing a plethora
of versions of 1-2-3 turns off some users. Ronan McGrath,
vice president for accounting at Canadian National Railways
in Montreal, who supervises some 2,000 PCs running 1-2-3
spreadsheets, says that only 40% of his users have upgraded.
Overall, analysts say that upgrades have fallen far below
expectations.
   Moreover, Lotus still lacks a 1-2-3 version for Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, and it doesn't have a version
specifically designed to work with Microsoft's Windows, a new
operating system to which many users are switching. Lotus
promises such a version in the future. Frank King, senior
vice president of the software business group, says that for
now it will advertise Release 3.1 as a Windows product,
because it can work with Windows.
   Meanwhile, the competition is getting tougher. Robert
Schechter, chief financial officer, says Lotus is holding on
to its traditional customers, but that many customers in new
markets, such as small business and home businesses, are
buying competitors' products.
   Borland International Ltd., for example, has sold many
copies of its Quattro Pro spreadsheet in a promotion under
which 1-2-3 users can send in the cover page of their Lotus
manual and get Quattro Pro for $99, less than they would pay
to upgrade to a new Lotus product. Quattro Pro also has the
advantage of running on older PCs while providing the
good-looking printouts that users want.
   "There's definitely an effect from competition," says
Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. He
estimates that recently Lotus has been selling an average of
120,000 copies of 1-2-3 a month and 25,000 upgrades, with
Borland selling 45,000 copies of Quattro Pro and Microsoft
selling 35,000 copies of Excel.
   Mr. King of Lotus says that in the past, Borland and
Microsoft attempted unsuccessfully to dislodge Lotus on its
main turf, the large corporation. Now, he says, Borland in
particular is trying to establish brand new markets. "Last
year, they came straight up the beach at us. Now they're
trying a flanking move," he says. "It's war. No doubt about
it."
   To counter, Mr. King says Lotus has established new
territorial sales representatives to market 1-2-3 to smaller
companies and software stores. It also has devised a way to
identify where individual software products end up so that
territorial representatives can be given commissions.
   Lotus also maintains that Borland is cheating. It has sued
Borland, charging that Quattro infringes its copyright on
1-2-3. "They've used our intellectual property," Mr. King
says.
   Lotus has managed to keep the loyalty of the corporate
data-processing managers who buy 1-2-3 in bulk by introducing
1-2-3 on mainframes and minicomputers. It also outlines
longer-term plans to let users get information from corporate
databases. But the repeated slip-ups with bringing out a core
version of 1-2-3 are embarrassing. "They're like the man who
has his eye on the stars and slips in a mud puddle," says a
corporate customer who remains loyal.
   But some erstwhile fans say Lotus has made a mistake by
concentrating too much on the big corporations. Michael
Kolowich, a former Lotus executive who is now publisher of PC
Computing, a magazine for users, says: "In concentrating on
the very large corporate sites with an approach that is
reminiscent of IBM's account control strategy, Lotus has
probably lost some of its magic with the end users." Mr.
Kolowich says that individual users remain the driving force
in buying new software programs. "Lotus has lost a lot of
support at the grass roots," he adds.
