   Opportunities for American franchisers are expanding
substantially in both Western and Eastern Europe, says Arthur
Karp, chairman of the International Franchise Association.
Very small franchisers, as well as the giants, can benefit,
he believes.
   As head of the leading trade group of U.S. franchisers,
Mr. Karp recently led a group of American franchise company
executives through England, West Germany, France, Switzerland
and Spain to meet with investors and explore franchising
opportunities in Europe.

   Mr. Karp himself this year agreed to sell his 300-unit
chain, the Great American Cookie Co. in Atlanta, to a Belgian
investment group. On a recent trip to New York, he discussed
European opportunities with The Wall Street Journal.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How big, potentially, is the European franchise
market?
   A.: Franchising already accounts for 10% of retail sales
in France and 11% in England. There's no reason to assume
that it won't at some point approximate 25% to 30% in each of
those countries. I don't know if it will ever be 50% of all
retail sales, as we expect it to be in the United States.
Only time will tell. But there's no doubt that there is a
level of acceptance that was not dreamed of five years ago.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: What's driving the expansion of U.S. franchisers in
Europe?
   A.: With the unification of the Common Market in 1992,
franchising regulations could be even more uniform than in
the United States, where 14 states require independent
disclosures separate from what the Federal Trade Commission
requires.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: There also is the emergence of Eastern Europe as a new
marketplace. Only Hungary has enabling legislation that will
allow franchising. But the German Franchise Association, with
the French and the Americans, is putting together a trade
mission to Budapest to begin the process of bringing
franchising to other Eastern bloc countries you visited
officially demonstrated a desire for franchising, but who is
going to buy the franchises?
   A.: It is going to take some time to develop, but the
desire to be your own boss, to control your own destiny, is
universal. My sense is demand for franchises far exceeds
supply. In Madrid, the 14 franchising companies that were
with us on the trip had two days to meet with people. We made
close to 250 appointments.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How will U.S. franchisers finance their European
expansion?
   A: It's much easier to put the financing together in
Europe than it is in the U.S. Banks are much more aggressive
and more forward-thinking in finding ways to create financing
for franchising.
   Let me give you an example. A U.K. bank proposed providing
me with a $10 million pool of money to give to individual
franchisees who would put up 10% of whatever we lend them.
So, if it cost $150,000 to open a franchise, and the
franchisee came up with $15,000, that would give us {Great
American Cookie Co.} the right to issue them a $135,000 loan
against this $10 million line of credit.
   How can the bank take that kind of risk? They require that
we, the franchiser, guarantee 10% of the money they make
available to us. So if they make a $10 million fund
available, that's $1 million in losses I would have to pay.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: Have other foreign banks made similar offers?
   A.: Banks approached us in virtually every country we went
to. In Geneva, they hosted a breakfast for the franchisers
and made presentations offering their services and money.
They even offered to find us franchisees.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: You're obviously very bullish about expanding in
Europe. But what are the pitfalls?
   A.: Every seminar that the IFA has ever done on
international franchising tells franchisers that it's going
to cost more money than you expected and more of your
people's time than you expected to create a successful
franchise system in the international marketplace. All of the
rules by which the game is played are different.
   We investigated franchising in the Netherlands and learned
that there were vast differences in the way you function in
that country.
   They had a rule where companies with over 100 employees
had to create a council of 10 of their employees who would
have to approve major decisions made by the management of the
company. It's a socialistic concept. That may change with the
unification of the Common Market. Certainly not all of the
countries will agree to those kinds of restrictions.
   So step one is making sure that your system will function
successfully in the host country. Then choose an experienced
partner. Most franchisers select a master licenser who
becomes the franchiser in that country.
   The feeling is you need a local resident who understands
the folkways, the mores, the labor laws -- the things that
are different from country to country. I would think the way
to do it would be to have a local partner in each country.
There are a number of companies that have approached
licensers and suggested they have the entire Common Market.
Personally, I think that's a mistake.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How do you go about finding a partner?
   A.: The IFA has 14 affiliated organizations, like the
French Franchise Federation and the Portuguese Franchise
Association. So the first thing we do when we want to go into
a market is contact our affiliate organization, which might
recommend master licensers for us to pursue. Secondly, there
are the traditional kinds of sources: bankers, accountants,
lawyers. There are also the U.S. embassies, which have a
commercial officer in any major city. They have a service,
which you can buy, for negotiating an arrangement.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How will disputes be resolved?
   A.: A presentation by a law firm in Madrid talked about
that very issue. Most contracts are drawn to require that the
dispute is resolved under American law. They {the Madrid law
firm} thought a judgment entered in a U.S. court would be
difficult to enforce and that it might be more favorable for
a franchiser to resolve differences under the host country's
law.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: But doesn't a foreigner tend to fare worse in a
foreign court?
   A.: That's always been our feeling, and that's the reason
most contracts are written the way they are. Personally, I
would prefer to have the franchise established under American
law, just because I'm more comfortable in my own culture.
