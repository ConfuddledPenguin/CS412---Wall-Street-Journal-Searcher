   TOYOTA CITY, Japan -- A couple of years ago, flush with
the success of its extraordinary two-decade climb, Toyota was
beginning to get just a wee bit fat and happy.
   "We had become a bit self-satisfied," says Shoichiro
Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. "Perhaps arrogant."
Other auto companies, adds the 65-year-old grandson of
Toyota's founder, "were trying hard." So, Mr. Toyoda says,
Toyota decided "we had to try harder."

   That isn't good news for the competition.
   Now, a rededicated Toyota is preparing to launch a
full-scale attack on one of Detroit's biggest money-makers:
the booming European market. There, Toyota is spending more
than $1.5 billion, setting up an assembly plant and an engine
factory in the United Kingdom and a European design center in
Belgium.
   Toyota also has set its sights on the U.S. market for
full-sized pickups. This, too, is a Big Three cash cow, and a
segment the Japanese have so far never cracked.
   Meanwhile, on Toyota's hotly competitive home front, it is
riding a wave of new products. With 13 new car and truck
models rolled out in the past 18 months, it has managed to
hold onto a commanding 40% of the Japanese market despite
gains from a resurgent Nissan Motor Co.
   Toyota's factory workers seem to have caught the spirit.
Plant workers in Japan wear heart-shaped badges reading: "Are
you satisfying the customer?" Banners stretching across the
factory walls shout such slogans as "Good Thinking, Good
Products."
   As Toyota redoubles its efforts, increasing numbers of
auto-industry analysts, including executives of No. 1 auto
maker General Motors Corp., are convinced that the Japanese
company has set its sights on the ultimate industry goal:
world pre-eminence in automobiles.
   Toyota executives haven't stated such a goal publicly.
And, today, they remain a long way from it.
   General Motors continues to produce far more vehicles. GM
built 7.6 million cars, trucks and vans world-wide last year.
Toyota built 4.6 million. Toyota's stated production aim is
to hit six million vehicles late in the 1990s.
   As for market share, GM now holds 16% of global car and
truck sales. Toyota has about 9% and is aiming for 10% by the
mid-1990s.
   More significantly, over the past five years Toyota's
global vehicle production has surged 16.7% while GM's has
slipped 16.9%. In the U.S., Japan's largest auto maker has
moved into a virtual tie for third place in car sales with
Chrysler Corp. and Honda Motor Co.
   If dominance is indeed Toyota's goal, says GM President
Lloyd E. Reuss, his company "is prepared to meet all
challengers as we enter the '90s." But GM no longer has the
full confidence of industry experts in this regard. Analyst
Neal Doying, of Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., looks at what
the Japanese company is doing these days and declares:
"Toyota is destined to become the world's leading auto
company."
   Toyota's new Lexus luxury car is a smash hit. Its restyled
Previa minivans and sporty Celica compacts are overcoming a
reputation for stodgy styling. And it is building a radically
new sports car called the Sera, with "gull-wing" doors that
fold up instead of out.
   Now, Toyota makes three of the four cars with the fewest
defects sold in the U.S., says a study released early this
month by J.D. Power &amp; Associates of Agoura Hills, Calif. The
Cressida was first, the Kentucky-built Camry third and the
Lexus LS400 fourth.
   Moreover, Toyota holds $15.62 billion in cash, more than
four times the liquidity that once-cash-heavy Ford Motor Co.
now enjoys. As a result, it can get ultra-low-interest loans
and reinvest the proceeds at higher rates. Toyota had global
sales of $55.7 billion and earned $2.4 billion in the year
ended June 30, 1989; fiscal 1990 results aren't out yet.
   Even as Toyota is bursting on the world auto market, the
world is intruding on Toyota's cozy cocoon. Toyota's biggest
problem, in fact, may be a fondness for its parochial,
oft-stifling traditions.
   When Fujio Cho agreed to head Toyota's new assembly plant
in Georgetown, Ky., he expected culture shock, but not to
stay awake all night. Fretting executives 13 hours away in
Toyota City repeatedly telephoned him during their office
hours -- his sleeping hours. They questioned the need for
community donations, second-guessed dealings with American
parts-suppliers and even rebuked him for not using a Shinto
priest to dedicate the plant.
   They "didn't understand this country," says Mr. Cho, the
president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. "They demanded
to do everything the Toyota way." Now, the nitpicking has
stopped. "Things aren't so new and foreign," he explains.
   Toyota remains a corpocracy, though, conservative and
reluctant to innovate. Honda, Nissan and Mazda Motor Co. all
built U.S. plants before Toyota did. And only now, after long
resistance, are Toyota plants beginning to use "doors-off
assembly," in which a car's doors are removed while the
vehicle moves down the assembly line. This technique lets
workers install interior parts more easily and without
scratching the doors. Although several other auto makers,
including Ford and Honda, have used the technique for several
years, Toyota held back, fearing that the fit of the doors
might be compromised.
   Executives at the Kentucky plant, and at the joint venture
with GM in California, proudly note that they park their cars
in the same lots as all workers, and whoever arrives first
gets the best space. Back at Toyota City, though, parking
spaces still are assigned according to rank.
   What's more, as Mr. Cho's experience shows, Toyota
executives are most comfortable managing things they can see
from their Toyota City windows. As the company grew, it
clustered most of its facilities around Toyota City in
Japan's Aichi Prefecture to ensure prompt delivery of
materials and equipment. This allowed the company to perfect
"kanban," or just-in-time inventory delivery, especially
because hundreds of auto-parts suppliers also located there.
   In the process, Toyota City has become more than just a
place; it's a state of mind as well. More than half the
population has some connection to Toyota or a supplier.
Employees and their families still shop at company-sponsored
stores and relax at the company's huge sports center. And
members of the founding Toyoda family (the spelling of the
company name was changed in 1936 because it sounded clearer
in Japanese) command the respect normally accorded royalty.
The top floor of the Toyota City Hospital, for example, has a
special wing for senior executives.
   But now, Toyota City is a jam-packed boom town with an
acute labor shortage, and major expansion there has become
impractical. Moreover, the all-embracing conformity of Toyota
City doesn't appeal to today's young Japanese recruits.
Despite the company's stellar profits and stability, they
prefer the bright lights of Tokyo.
   Toyota executives recognize these problems. They're
drawing up blueprints for new plants in Hokkaido and Kyushu,
Japan's northernmost and southernmost major islands, mostly
to supply the domestic market. The step was once
unimaginable, but "we have reached the limits" in Toyota
City, says Tadaaki Jagawa, who oversees production.
   Besides, the Kentucky plant's success has eased many
fears. "We aren't so worried," President Toyoda says, "about
producing cars far away now."
   Increasingly, this means very far away. Overseas plants
will spearhead Toyota's program to expand its overall
production. Besides the new British facilities, Toyota plans
factories in such places as Turkey and Pakistan in its
campaign to push its production into areas where it has had
little presence.
   In the U.S., Toyota, which has been selling about 950,000
vehicles a year, expects to push U.S. sales to 1.5 million
cars and trucks by 1995. It also expects to build about half
of those vehicles, or about 750,000, in the U.S. and Canada.
   Meanwhile, Iwao Isomura, managing director for personnel,
is trying to eliminate what he calls "big corporation
disease." Last year, Toyota wiped out a layer of middle
management, mostly by eliminating titles and cutting back the
signatures needed for decisions. Employees no longer must
address superiors by titles. The Japanese characters on all
business cards are now written horizontally instead of
vertically -- a symbol of the effort to create a less
hierarchical environment.
   All this is radical stuff for Japanese executives who took
two years before agreeing with their U.S. subordinates that
the leather interior in the Lexus LS400 should be wrinkled
instead of smooth. But global growth is forcing Toyota to
decentralize, albeit in ever-so-methodical fashion.
   Working at Calty Design Research, Toyota's Southern
California design center, used to mean little clout and lots
of frustration. In 17 years, Calty had fully designed only
one car. Designers fought with head-office officials about
whether to paint sports cars black. The Japanese insisted
black was strictly for limousines and big executive cars; the
Americans argued it could also be sporty. Eventually, Toyota
City gave in.
   "Six years ago, after I got here, I pushed the message
that our styling had to improve," says Robert McCurry, the
aggressive executive vice president of Toyota's U.S. sales
operations. "Americans have long bought Toyotas for their
quality, but now they want more. After all these years,
they're listening in Japan."
   Now, Calty can boast that it designed Toyota's futuristic
Previa minivan, which is already a hit in the U.S. and Japan.
"If we'd done the Previa 10 years ago, it wouldn't have been
accepted," says David Hackett, Calty's director. "The company
wasn't ready for that sort of thing to come out of America."
   Calty also is helping design the next generation of the
family-sized Camry, expected to be a 1992 model. The version
sold in the U.S. will be wider and longer than the Japanese
one, with sportier performance, handling and appearance. So
different will it be that Toyota is considering shipping it
to Japan and selling it as a car distinct from the Japanese
Camry.
   Besides expanding Calty and building in Brussels, Toyota
has just opened a new design center in Tokyo. "We have to
develop cars for each region using the talents of the people
there," Mr. Toyoda says. "They know what's best for their
market."
   The Tokyo design center is a more radical step, in a way,
than the ones overseas. To spur creativity, the 30 designers
who work there are encouraged to take in concerts or just go
exploring. Working hours are flexible, and the dress is
casual. "The values and life styles are completely different
in Tokyo," says Kazuo Morohoshi, a Calty alumnus who now is
the general manager of the Tokyo center. To many executives
at Toyota City, he adds, "Tokyo is another foreign place just
like California or Europe." Yet Mr. Morohoshi's team claims
much of the credit for the Sera, the new gull-wing sports
car, which is to be sold only in Japan.
   While Toyota struggles with global expansion, rival auto
makers are puzzling over how to compete with the company. Not
only is Toyota's market share rebounding in Japan; it's
surging in the U.S. Toyota captured 8.8% of U.S. car sales in
the 1990 first half, up from just 6.4% a year before. With
Camrys pouring out of Kentucky, Toyota is discounting prices
and invading markets it long ignored, notably rental fleets.
Lexus nearly outsold BMW in the first half and beat Porsche,
Jaguar, Audi and Sterling combined.
   The Lexus experience illustrates that although Toyota can
stumble, it isn't afraid to address problems head-on. Last
December, Toyota had to recall the LS400 to fix three
different defects, including one that could cause the
cruise-control system to stay on after the driver tried to
turn it off. The defects were dismaying in a just-launched
sedan costing $38,000 or more.
   Each owner, though, got a personal phone call, and two
choices: Bring the car in yourself to be fixed on the spot,
or have Lexus pick it up at night and return it ready-to-go
the next morning. Either way, Lexus not only fixed the defect
but also washed the car, cleaned the inside and filled it
with gasoline. Some dealers even placed a small gift, such as
an ice scraper, on the front seat. Owners were mollified, and
many were impressed.
   "They went the extra mile, more than any other
manufacturer, to make sure I was completely taken care of,"
says William Beatty, a St. Louis doctor whose family owns
three Lexus cars. "I mean, nobody has ever washed my car or
filled my tank when it was taken in for repairs."
