   WASHINGTON -- Attorneys for Melvyn Paisley, the former
Navy research chief at the center of the Pentagon bribery and
influence-peddling scandal, are discussing a plea agreement
with federal prosecutors, according to law-enforcement
officials and others familiar with the talks.
   Mr. Paisley hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, and a
final agreement hasn't been signed. But if the talks, as
expected, produce a settlement, it would be the climax of the
government's much-publicized investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud dubbed "Operation Ill Wind." Some
law-enforcement officials said they expect an agreement by
the fall.

   Mr. Paisley's attorney, Lawrence Barcella, who has
maintained in the past that his client didn't violate any
laws, declined to comment on any discussions with
prosecutors. "It rarely serves anyone's interests to discuss
whether or not a target" of a criminal probe or his attorney
are "having conversations with the government," Mr. Barcella
said earlier this week. The settlement discussions were first
reported by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   The talks picked up steam in the past few weeks, according
to law-enforcement officials, as investigators pored over
statements and other evidence provided by William Galvin, a
former close associate of Mr. Paisley. Mr. Galvin, who was
one of the most influential and highly paid defense-industry
consultants, pleaded guilty four months ago to bribing Mr.
Paisley and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
   Federal investigators and court documents have described
Mr. Paisley as the alleged centerpiece of various schemes
that improperly supplied bid-related information to certain
consultants and tried to steer lucrative contracts to several
of the concerns they represented. Officials familiar with the
case said prosecutors have considered seeking bribery,
conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Mr. Paisley, who
was a Boeing Co. executive before he came to the Pentagon in
President Reagan's first term.
   Relying partly on Mr. Galvin's cooperation, prosecutors
also continue to assemble evidence against Victor Cohen, a
senior Air Force acquisition official and the other
individual who remains a major target of the long-running
Alexandria, Va., grand-jury inquiry. Mr. Galvin, as part of
his guilty plea, admitted to conspiring to bribe Mr. Cohen as
part of an influence-peddling scheme.
   Mr. Cohen still works for the Air Force but has been
removed from acquisition decisions. Since his name surfaced
in the investigation, he has denied any improprieties. Some
law-enforcement officials insisted that Mr. Cohen, too, has
been considering a plea agreement. But in a brief interview,
Mr. Cohen said: "I can assure you there is no negotiation or
plea bargaining under way."
   Prosecutors have secured more than 30 convictions in the
three-year-old inquiry, including several prominent industry
consultants, a number of midsized defense contractors and
some relatively low-level Pentagon officials. If Mr. Paisley
agrees to cooperate with the government, investigators hope
to learn more about the role of major contractors, senior
defense-industry executives and Pentagon higher-ups in the
scandal.
