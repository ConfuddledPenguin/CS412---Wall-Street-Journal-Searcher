   Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it will
invest $20 million in a company that will purchase a nuclear
power plant in South Haven, Mich.
   While Westinghouse is a major supplier of nuclear-plant
technology, the move marks the company's first ownership
interest in a commercial nuclear plant. The diversified
company has broadcasting, financial services and
manufacturing lines.

   Westinghouse will have a 22% equity interest in Palisades
Generating Co., which was formed two years ago to buy the
768-megawatt nuclear generating plant. A megawatt equals
1,000 kilowatts; a kilowatt-hour is the amount of electrical
energy consumed when 1,000 watts are used for one hour. The
purchase is expected to completed next year.
   The other principal investors in Palisades Generating are
Bechtel Group Inc., a San Francisco-based engineering and
construction firm, with a 33% stake, and the Consumers Power
Co. unit of CMS Energy Corp., with a 44% equity interest.
Consumers Power, Jackson, Mich., owns and operates the plant,
which began commercial operations in 1971.
