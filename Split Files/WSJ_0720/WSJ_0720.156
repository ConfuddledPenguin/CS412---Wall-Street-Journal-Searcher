   Ford Motor Co. said it has received offers for its Ford
Aerospace operations from Loral Corp., a group led by
Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a joint venture formed by
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit and Alcatel
N.V. of Belgium.
   Ford declined to disclose details of the bids, but a
spokesman said the Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker expects
to narrow the field to one bidder within one or two weeks.

   Some analysts have speculated that Ford Aerospace could
fetch as much as $1.5 billion. But others have said Ford
Aerospace's satellite-building and defense operations could
sell for less than $1 billion in a time of declining military
spending.
   Hughes and Alcatel, a telecommunications venture of ITT
Corp. and Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, have entered a
joint bid, a Ford spokesman said. Hughes, already the largest
maker of commercial satellites in the U.S., is almost
certainly looking to extend its lead in that market by
picking up Ford Aerospace's extensive military and
communications satellite operations. Los Angeles-based Hughes
Aircraft said that, as a matter of policy, it couldn't
confirm or deny any prospective acquisition.
   Ford and General Electric Co.'s RCA unit traditionally
battle for the No. 2 position in the industry, experts say,
raising antitrust questions about a Ford Aerospace-Hughes
combination.
   Alcatel is already a subcontractor to Ford Aerospace on a
project for the International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization, a 118-member group based in Washington that is
responsible for most of the satellite hookups in the Western
world.
   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, meanwhile, has said it sees
the potential for Ford Aerospace enhancing its radar and
electronics lines.
   Westinghouse has said it would like to expand into
commercial electronics and has been searching for possible
acquisitions. That business would build on the company's
strong position in military radar and sensors and enable
Westinghouse to supply air traffic control equipment to
airports around the world. With the defense budget shrinking,
Westinghouse is especially eager to move into commercial
aerospace.
   Ford said Westinghouse is bidding as part of a consortium
that includes Carlyle Group, a Washington-based merchant
bank, and Aerospatiale, a French aerospace concern.
   A spokesman for New York-based Loral confirmed that the
defense electronics firm is a bidder and said Ford
Aerospace's defense and space electronics operations offer "a
natural fit and development for us."
   Just a few weeks ago, an investment banker close to the
Ford Aerospace deal said a number of companies were still
hoping just to purchase pieces of the Newport Beach, Calif.,
subsidiary. Ford, however, has been eager to shed the entire
unit in one piece.
   The Los Angeles Times recently reported that Martin
Marietta Corp. had submitted a final bid for Ford Aerospace,
which also manufactures, among other things, the Sidewinder
and Chapparal missiles. What may have happened to that offer
wasn't clear. Officials of the Bethesda, Md., company weren't
immediately available for comment.
