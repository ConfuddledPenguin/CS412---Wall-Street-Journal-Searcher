   To his lifelong friend Charles Lamb, he was "an archangel
slightly damaged." To his early disciple turned vociferous
critic William Hazlitt, he was a man "sunk into torpid,
uneasy repose, tantalized by useless resources, haunted by
vain imaginings, his lips idly moving." To almost everyone
who encountered him, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was
a dazzling force of nature. Part poet, part orator, part
metaphysical seer, he was a wordsmith who invariably beguiled
his auditors with an unstoppable stream of brilliant,
intoxicating talk.
   The cataract of talk even reached into posterity. "He
seems not a man," wrote Virginia Woolf, "but a swarm, a
cloud, a buzz of words, darting this way and that,
clustering, quivering, and hanging suspended." Yet Coleridge
was much more than a fountain of words. As his biographer,
Richard Holmes, shows in his superlative account of
Coleridge's early life, "Coleridge: Early Vision" (Viking,
409 pages, $22.95), he was in many ways the quintessential
English Romantic.

   More than the grim and prosey Wordsworth, perhaps even
more than the flamboyant Byron or the ethereal Shelley,
Coleridge incarnated the spiritual aspirations of his age.
That he also incarnated its excesses and liabilities is only
too familiar. Coleridge the stalled writer, the irresponsible
dreamer, the shameless plagiarizer; Coleridge the opium
addict and burnt-out case: All that is as much a part of our
literary folklore as Coleridge the author of "Kubla Khan" and
"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
   In this first of two projected volumes, Mr. Holmes takes
us from Coleridge's birth at Devon to the eve of his
departure for Malta in 1804. He chronicles, in other words,
the career of the visionary Coleridge: the radical utopian
schemer and poetic innovator who dreamed of a commune by the
Susquehanna River in America and who collaborated with
Wordsworth on "Lyrical Ballads."
   He also writes of Coleridge the unhappy and perpetually
absent husband, the unrequited lover, the increasingly
despondent and drug-sodden waster. Still to come are
Coleridge the great literary critic, the religious thinker,
the public philosopher.
   The youngest of 10 children, Coleridge found his bucolic
home life shattered when his father -- a learned minister and
schoolmaster -- died in 1781. The young boy was promptly
packed off to school at Christ's Hospital in London, a
brutalizing place that nonetheless provided him with a good
grounding in classics and, eventually, a scholarship to Jesus
College, Cambridge.
   Coleridge was ferociously precocious, able to read a
chapter of the Bible when only three and blessed with an
extraordinary memory. But he proved to be a dilatory student
at best. Already at Cambridge his vacillating and irresolute
character was on full display. Mr. Holmes duly reports the
"wild expenditure on books, drinking, violin lessons, theater
and whoring . . . alternating with fits of suicidal gloom and
remorse." "Coleridge was," he notes, "a man who could confess
spiritual despair at midday; and dine out brilliantly at
midnight."
   But in truth it was restlessness, not sloth, that was
Coleridge's besetting vice. Would that more of us were as
productive as he] Always a prodigious walker, he once covered
263 miles in eight days. He was capable of writing 76
newspaper articles in five months or composing 50 blank verse
lines of a translation of Schiller's "Wallenstein" in a
single day.
   Yet he could not stay put. A planned three-month trip in
Germany with the Wordsworths stretched on for 10 months. As
usual, his wife, Sara, remained impatiently behind with the
children, one of whom died while his father was away.
Coleridge was as addicted to drawing up lists of impossible
works and projects as he was to opium. "He dreamed more than
he planned," writes Mr. Holmes, "he planned more than he
could execute {and he was} never still or concentrated for
more than a few weeks at a time."
   Mr. Holmes does not attempt to excuse Coleridge's
failings. But his enthusiasm for this damaged archangel
remains undiminished. Rather, like Coleridge himself, he
understands -- and lets us understand -- that "the hope of
recreating himself imaginatively out of the sense of failure
itself" early on became one of Coleridge's chief spurs to
creativity and reflection.
   In this, Coleridge could not have been more different from
Wordsworth. While Wordsworth was composing his great
Immortality Ode, with its vision of the past as a "perpetual
benediction," Coleridge wrote "Dejection: An Ode," meditating
on "A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,/ Which finds no
natural outlet, no relief."
   This account of the young Coleridge is a fit sequel to Mr.
Holmes's magisterial biography of Shelley (1974). Perhaps its
greatest achievement is to have reminded us of how complex
Coleridge was, how he managed to salvage an enlivening
passion even from disappointment and dissipation. "If he does
not leap out of these pages -- brilliant, animated, endlessly
provoking -- and invade your imagination," Mr. Holmes writes
in his preface, "then I have failed to do him justice." Few
readers, perhaps, will close this book unexasperated by
Coleridge's foibles; I think none will come to the end
unmoved by his painfully expansive genius.
