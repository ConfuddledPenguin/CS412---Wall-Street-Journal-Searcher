   NEW YORK -- Prospects of cold waves in Brazilian
coffee-growing areas heated up coffee futures prices. But the
rally cooled, and most of the gains were erased.
   The September contract ended 0.90 cent a pound higher at
88.85 cents. It traded as high as 89.20 cents and as low as
87.50.

   Prices were strong initially on reports that a cold wave
was expected to come in from Chile and hit Brazilian
coffee-growing areas early this morning, a trade source said.
Later, the forecast was changed and the colder temperatures
are expected to arrive this evening and early tomorrow,
according to the dealer. He said another cold wave is
expected to hit Tuesday and a third on Thursday.
   According to Peter Leavitt, meteorologist for Weather
Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., the reports were basically
correct, but "I don't expect any freezing weather," he said.
   The strongest cold wave will be the first one, he said,
and temperatures in major coffee-growing areas such as Sao
Paulo, Minas Gerais and Parana are expected to range between
37 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday morning. The coldest
temperatures will be in the most southern areas such as
Parana.
   "Those temperatures will be the lowest, and the cold
movements next week will be mostly in Argentina and head east
rather than northward toward Brazil," Mr. Leavitt said.
   It is winter in Brazil, when that nation's coffee crops
are most susceptible to cold weather damage. July 15 is
generally regarded as the point of greatest danger, with the
likelihood of damaging frost receding after that. However,
there have been damaging frosts in late August and even at
the beginning of September.
   A major frost in July 1975 wiped out the coffee harvest in
the then-major coffee-producing state of Parana, which was
also the southernmost coffee-producing area. Since then,
coffee-growing has been intensified in more northern states
such as Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais.
   Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities,
New York, observed that the selling, which trimmed the early
gains, came mostly from producing countries, which were
selling contracts to lock in prices and take advantage of the
gains.
   "There also appeared to be some liquidation as it became
evident that there wasn't any damage in Guatemalan
coffee-growing areas because of the earthquake earlier in the
week," he said.
   There was some profit-taking following three days of
advances as well, he said. But, with the prospect of cold
weather on Sunday and next week, renewed demand developed and
helped firm prices toward the close.
   Stephen Platt, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago,
said that contributing to the recent strength in prices has
been strong rains, particularly in western sections of Sao
Paulo and Parana.
   "This has caused concern over possible deterioration of
coffee quality and some yield losses as well," he said.

   SUGAR: Futures prices were strong. The October contract
rose 0.44 cent a pound to 11.43 cents. No fresh developments
accounted for the rally, analysts said. However, one analyst,
noting the October price had dropped five cents since the
beginning of May, said the market may have been oversold.
There was active buying of contracts by dealers, according to
the analyst, but it wasn't known whether the buying was
associated with transactions in the cash market. The recent
price declines were attributed mainly to the lack of demand
for sugar from major nations such as the Soviet Union and
China, excellent current crop progress and improved prospects
for the 1990-91 crop, according to Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch. However, Ms. Ganes said buying by smaller
nations cumulatively has surpassed expectations for the
season so far and to a large degree has made up for the lack
of major buyers. In the first 10 months of the 1989-90
season, which began last September, 34 countries bought a
total of six million tons of sugar. Ms. Ganes said the German
statistical firm F.O. Licht had predicted those nations would
buy just 6,250,000 tons over the whole season.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined. The September contract
was off 1.40 cents a pound to $1.1790. Expectations of a
strong rise in copper supplies and news that Asarco Inc. and
the United Steelworkers Union would resume contract talks
contributed to the easier tone, analysts said. Asarco and the
union will sit down together for the first time since July 3,
two days after the workers went on strike at the company's
mine in Arizona, a company spokesman said. The old contract
ran out June 30. One analyst said the general feeling is that
once the company and the union resume negotiations, a
settlement would follow soon. The increase in London Metal
Exchange warehouse stocks of copper is expected to range from
5,000 to 20,000 tons when it is announced today, analysts
said. Earlier in the week, there were predictions that the
stocks would increase by as much as 10,000 tons.

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futures
contracts retreated for the second consecutive day. Analysts
attributed the decline to signs that meatpackers are having
an easier time finding hogs to slaughter. Hog prices have
been strong most of the year because of tight supplies. At
the same time, high retail prices caused by those high hog
prices appear to be choking off demand for pork in the
supermarket. The contract for July delivery of pork bellies,
which are used to make bacon, fell its daily limit of two
cents to settle at 46.5 cents a pound. Prices of most cattle
futures contracts slipped in quiet trading.
