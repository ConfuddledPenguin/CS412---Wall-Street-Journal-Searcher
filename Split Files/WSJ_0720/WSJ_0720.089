   George Bush didn't get the civil rights bill he wanted
from the Senate this week, but not for lack of trying.
   Mr. Bush claimed to want "desperately" to sign a bill, and
his opponents sensed his political hunger. They held their
positions, while Mr. Bush gave more ground than the Italian
Africa corps. He stopped just short of accepting
unconditional surrender in the form of racial quotas. Mr.
Bush's reputed homeland -- the ground of equal opportunity,
not equal outcomes -- looks ravaged nonetheless.

   The Kennedy-Hawkins bill that passed the Senate 65-34
illustrates the growing failure of the White House political
strategy of splitting the difference with Congress. Mr. Bush
is doing all the splitting. Chief of Staff John Sununu "did
everything but jump through hoops" to get a deal with Sen.
Ted Kennedy, say several Senate sources. His pre-emptive
concessions even undercut an anti-quota alternative by Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) that was drawing Democrats.
   Mr. Bush wants a bill -- he doesn't want to veto anything
labeled "civil rights" -- but Democrats want both a campaign
issue and a bill. Black voters are a core Democratic
constituency, their last one other than unions. The thought
of Mr. Bush getting 20% of the black vote in 1992 terrifies
them. Even a veto threat provides welcome publicity. So Mr.
Kennedy kept waiting, and Mr. Sununu kept giving.
   The two thought they had a deal last week, until Mr.
Kennedy reneged Monday. Mr. Sununu called a press conference
to complain, but he was still willing to carry one more
concession back to the Hill. President Bush even put in a
personal call to Majority Leader George Mitchell's office
Tuesday night to urge the senators on. But Mr. Kennedy was
saying privately he had no reason to compromise. He figures
the White House will return with more concessions after the
House passes a similar bill this summer.
   This is also the strategy of the civil-rights industry --
now more conglomerate than cause -- and its curly-haired CEO
Ralph Neas. Mr. Neas has an engaging public demeanor that
masks an iron fist. He's his own good cop-bad cop. He
choreographed this week's moves for Democrats, much as he did
the Bork and Lucas nomination fights.
   He and his allies spurned the usual Senate reception room
and massed, like a panel of judges, just outside the Senate
chamber. When their troops -- the senators -- won a vote to
cut off debate, they gave a cheer that carried halfway across
the Capitol. Mr. Neas thinks he has George Bush rolled, too.
   "Kennedy wasn't running this show," says a White House
negotiator. "We'd think we had a deal, then he'd come back
and there'd be no deal. These civil rights groups want all or
nothing."
   What they want is to bring civil-rights lawsuits into the
trial lawyers' lottery. Heretofore, damages in bias suits
have been aimed at reconciliation -- reinstatement and back
pay. Kennedy-Hawkins opens the door to sky's-the-limit
judgments. More lawsuits will be filed, many of them
frivolous, and employers accused of bias will want to settle
rather than gamble on a multi-million dollar payment. This
will enrich the civil-rights bar, though how it will serve
racial harmony is a mystery.
   The entire bill is a lawyers' feast. No one else can
understand it. Weeks of debate have focused on legal jargon
like "business necessity" or the "Griggs" decision. Yet it's
crucial jargon because the civil-rights lobby has based its
entire strategy on the courts. Lawsuits, not economic
self-help or education, are its thing. But suits are blunt
instruments, even in a good cause.
   The Kennedy-Hawkins language puts the legal burden on
employers to prove in court that they didn't discriminate --
simply because they may have hired fewer Hispanics or women
than in the surrounding population. So any sane employer who
wants to avoid a suit will simply hire by statistics -- by
using quotas. Mr. Sununu's compromises would have ceded too
much of the Kennedy language.
   Everyone claims to hate quotas, of course, and Mr. Kennedy
even put in a clause saying the bill doesn't "require" them.
But, as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) points out, this is
"worse than phony." The issue is whether the incentives in
the bill make it all but certain that employers will use
quotas in practice.
   Just how much all of this has strayed from the original
civil rights vision is clear enough from a letter Mr. Bush
received last month from Morris Abram. Mr. Abram is a hero of
the original civil-rights days who argued the one-man,
one-vote case before the Supreme Court. He didn't release the
letter, but a copy was obtained by the Forward, a Jewish
weekly.
   Mr. Abram wrote that Kennedy-Hawkins "is not a civil
rights bill but a quota bill because it will achieve
precisely what the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act stood
four-square against." He added, "Abraham Lincoln's great
friend Frederick Douglass understood the divisive and
destructive influence of proportional representation based on
race. `Equality of numbers,' he wrote in 1871, `has nothing
to do with equality of attainments.'"
   Mr. Bush agrees with this philosophy, because he quoted
that last passage in a speech this Wednesday. If he pressed
these arguments, maybe Ted Kennedy would be making the
concessions.
