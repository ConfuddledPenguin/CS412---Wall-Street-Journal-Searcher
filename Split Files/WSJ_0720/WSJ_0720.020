   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it is recalling about
656,000 1988-1990 model cars to fix defects that could cause
shoulder safety belts to fail in an accident and, in separate
cases, engine fires.
   Separately, Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling 110,000 of
its 1989-90 model E- and F-Series 4x2 trucks to correct a
defect in the transmission. The problem could cause the truck
to roll after being parked on a slope without the parking
brake engaged, the company said.

   Both GM and Ford said they are telling owners about the
recalls by mail. Dealers will make the necessary repairs at
no charge, the companies said.
   GM said it is recalling about 616,000 midsize cars to fix
shoulder belt assemblies that could break in a severe
accident. The recall affects two-door versions of the 1988-90
Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme cars, as well as 1990 model Chevrolet Lumina coupes.
Four-door versions of these cars aren't affected, the company
said. GM isn't aware of any accidents or injuries resulting
from this defect, a spokesman said.
   In a separate action, GM is recalling nearly 40,000
1988-90 Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro models that
could have defective fuel hoses. A faulty hose could leak
gasoline, and that could result in a fire under the hood, the
company said. GM said it knows of one fire resulting from a
faulty fuel hose but is unaware of any injuries resulting
from the problem.
