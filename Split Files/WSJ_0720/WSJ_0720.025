   BUSH LACKS a strong national theme as he plunges into this
year's campaigns.
   With the loss of the anti-Communist and no-new-taxes
issues, the president is likely to emphasize local issues in
his travels for GOP candidates, such as offshore drilling in
California. Otherwise, he will stress such fallback issues as
education and drugs.

   Some national GOP strategists say privately that Florida's
Gov. Martinez is doing so poorly that the White House may
eventually limit its efforts there to focus elsewhere. In
Texas, on the other hand, the White House is comfortable for
now with the prospects of gubernatorial candidate Williams
and isn't planning a major push -- but is ready to turn up
the energy if he runs into serious trouble.
   HUD chief Kemp is the cabinet member most in demand by GOP
candidates; others often requested are Dole, Yeutter and
chief of staff Sununu.
                                                                                                       

   BRADY'S STOCK rises somewhat on Capitol Hill.
   Both Democrats and Republicans at the budget summit pay
the Treasury secretary greater heed, noting his personal ties
to Bush and his role in getting the president to sign on to
last month's statement on higher taxes. Budget chief Darman,
finding his reputation as a schemer hard to shake, enlists
Brady to help court Bentsen and other key Democrats.
   Brady aides, accustomed to criticism of their boss,
delight in reports that summit deliberations on taxes were
deferred because he was out of town. But his newfound
credibility does little to help him on other issues: His plan
to shift jurisdiction over stock futures to the SEC from the
CFTC finds little enthusiasm.
                                                                                                       

   NUNN'S PRIORITIES on defense spending face rising
opposition.
   The Senate Armed Services chairman faces sharp criticism
for his $289 billion spending bill. Republican Wallop
complains it cuts too deeply into SDI and nuclear weapons.
But Nunn's biggest headache is fellow Democrats like Levin
and Dixon, who want deeper reductions.
   Strategists see a series of close votes when the bill hits
the Senate floor, especially on further SDI cuts, on the
Milstar satellite communications system and on U.S. troop
levels. Lawmakers looking for quick savings might also go
after the maintenance and training accounts, where Nunn
managed to fend off deep cuts.
   The House is bound to vote deeper cuts, setting up a tough
fight for Nunn when the bill moves to conference.
                                                                                                       

   NUMBERS GAMES: Democratic charges that the FBI has a
backlog of more than 20,000 unaddressed S&amp;L fraud cases don't
mention that most of them involve less than $25,000. But
despite Attorney General Thornburgh's contention that all
"major" cases are under investigation, FBI field agents say
that in some notorious centers of S&amp;L failures, such as
Southern California, dozens of $1 million-plus cases are
backed up.
                                                                                                       

   MISSING PERSON: Who doesn't appear in Sen. Helms's new TV
ads? Helms himself. The ads, aimed at portraying the
controversial North Carolinian as a mainstream Republican,
consist entirely of footage from a Bush appearance last
month. "I need Jesse Helms," says the president. Except for
the disclosure of who bought the ad, Helms's name never even
appears on screen.
                                                                                                       

   A NATIONAL SALES TAX is quietly promoted by corporate
lobbyist Charls Walker as a way for interest groups that may
be targeted for specific tax increases, such as the
securities industry, to spread the pain to a broader group.
Some GOP budget summiteers discussed the notion with Walker
and have brought it up in the talks. But even Walker says, "I
don't think the time has come yet."
                                                                                                       

   NASA'S NEXT big project, approved by Congress just nine
months ago, already hits major snags. Space agency officials
say that the $1.6 billion project to send separate robot
crafts to Saturn and a comet by 1996 is already $70 million
over budget, and that they may have to drop some of the
experiments they had planned to include.
                                                                                                       

   FARM INTERESTS BRACE for bloody clashes on the House floor
next week.
   Even as the Senate continues to debate the new farm bill,
a House coalition of conservative Republicans and urban
Democrats makes plans to derail costly provisions. One goal:
a means test that would deny so-called deficiency payments to
any farmer who makes over $100,000. Another: a 10% trim in
sugar price supports as the first step in a gradual
phase-out. Peanut subsidies will also be targeted.
   In response, Agriculture Chairman de la Garza and ranking
GOP committee member Madigan appeal for a united front by
farmstate lawmakers and lobbyists. The message: Stop
squabbling and take an all-for-one, one-for-all stand. But
some GOP leaders, including Senate leader Dole, mull a
one-year extension of the current law to put off messy fights
until after this year's elections.
   The administration still favors a five-year bill, but
would accept a one-year extension.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: House Social Security Subcommittee Chairman
Jacobs advises witnesses "that they will be allowed no more
than two `finally's' and one `in conclusion.'" . . . Treasury
aides scour the Capitol for a budget briefing notebook that
Brady lost, fearing it has fallen into unfriendly hands. . .
. Bush officially proclaims this the "Decade of the Brain."
