   Unisys Corp. said second-quarter earnings fell 78% on
lower revenue, but the computer company reiterated its hope
that a strong fourth quarter would put it in the black for
the year.
   The results came in slightly below expectations, however,
and securities analysts said Unisys has a tough row to hoe --
especially in light of the company's acknowledgement that
growth in its international business slowed while domestic
business remained depressed.

   "You kind of feel for these guys," said Dan Benton of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "They're smart guys and they know what
they have to do, but they really have their work cut out for
them."
   Mr. Benton's comments reflected a new, almost sympathetic
attitude on Wall Street toward Unisys' woes, which have been
battering the Blue Bell, Pa., company's stock for more than a
year. Still, many analysts again cut their estimate of 1990
earnings, to deliver a new consensus of 50 cents to $1 a
share, down from 75 cents to $1.50.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Unisys shares closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents.
   Second-quarter results showed progress in cutting
expenses, which dropped 5.2% from a year earlier. Operating
profit rose 36%, to $102 million, and Unisys' heavy debt was
trimmed by $265 million, with much of that reduction financed
by a $150 million sale of preferred stock to Japan's Mitsui &amp;
Co.
   But gross profit margins reversed the progress they made
in the first quarter, dropping to 37% from 39%, "not the most
encouraging sign," said Steve Milunovich of First Boston
Corp. And revenue was hurt by a tough comparison with 1989,
when a new line of mainframes rolled out to pent-up demand.
That momentum has faded, replaced by growth in more strategic
-- but currently unprofitable -- low-end products based on
the Unix operating system.
   Earnings in the quarter were $11.8 million, which
translated to a loss of nine cents a share after preferred
dividend payments. That compared with earnings of $53.6
million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
Revenue fell 4% to $2.47 billion from $2.57 billion.
   In the first half, the company posted earnings of $8.6
million, which translated to a loss of 28 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $25.1 million, or 50 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue was virtually unchanged at $4.78
billion.
   "We are continuing to pursue our priority goal of
profitability for the full year, recognizing that based on a
seasonally weak third quarter this requires a strong fourth
quarter," James Unruh, Unisys' president and chief executive,
said in a statement.
   Because of the lackluster quarterly showing, Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it will consider lowering its ratings on
debt and preferred stock of Unisys and its finance
subsidiary. About $4 billion in debt is affected.
   S&amp;P said the review covers Unisys' triple-B senior debt,
triple-B-minus subordinated debt and double-B-plus preferred
stock, and Unisys Finance Corp.'s triple-B senior debt.
