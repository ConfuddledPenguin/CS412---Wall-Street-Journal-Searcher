   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. reported nearly flat
second-quarter earnings on a small decrease in sales.
   Weighing down revenue was American Express's troubled
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. securities unit.

   The travel and financial services concern said net income
was $319.6 million, up from $316.1 million in the
year-earlier period. Per-share earnings were 73 cents in both
quarters, reflecting in part the dilution created by the
recent sale of 20 million new shares. Sales fell 4.6% to
$6.06 billion from $6.36 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Express closed at $31.25, up 25 cents.
   Although Shearson had net income of $51 million after two
consecutive quarters of operating losses, American Express
attributed the drop in revenue to Shearson. Revenue at the
unit slumped 20% to $2.62 billion, including a 41.5% plunge
in investment banking revenue to $154 million. In contrast,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. earlier this week said investment banking
revenue grew 8.4% in the quarter. Shearson's net fell 8.6%
from the $55 million in profit a year earlier.
   Shearson doesn't appear overly optimistic about a
turnaround in investment banking. The transaction pipeline
"is fair, and perhaps improving," Shearson told analysts
yesterday.
   Shearson's Boston Co. money management unit, which serves
wealthy investors, had a pretax loss of $11 million on sales
of securities for the firm's own account.
   The news wasn't all bad for Shearson. Despite the downturn
in investment banking and brokerage commissions, which were
off 18%, Shearson trimmed operating expenses 20%.
   "They're doing what they can to reduce the size of the
organization, but it's a huge place," said John Keefe,
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "It's tough to unwind
that." Shearson, which employs nearly 33,000, will rename
itself Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. next month.
   American Express owns 68% of Shearson's common stock and a
60% stake overall. As part of the effort to shore up
Shearson's finances, American Express will acquire the rest
of the firm's common after a merger plan is approved at
Shearson's annual meeting Aug. 9. At that point, American
Express will own 92% of Shearson's voting shares, with Nippon
Life Insurance Co. owning the remainder.
   Earnings at American Express also were damped by higher
interest expenses associated with a $750 million capital
infusion into Shearson at the close of the first quarter.
Altogether, corporate expenses and equity investments in the
second quarter more than doubled to $61 million.
   Three of American Express' other operating divisions
reported record quarters, although earnings at American
Express Bank declined 10%.
   Travel Related Services earned $249 million, up 16%, as
revenue jumped 15% to $2.4 billion. American Express
customers charged $28 billion on their cards in the quarter,
up 11% from the year-earlier period. The number of charge
cards in use increased 7.8% to 36 million, while the number
of businesses accepting American Express cards jumped 14% to
3.1 million.
   IDS Financial Services earned $52 million, up 21%. The
division attributed the increase to growth in assets owned or
managed, which rose 16% to $50 billion. Sales gained 21% to
$561 million.
   American Express Information Services Corp. had profit of
$22 million, a 25% increase, as revenue grew 23% to $213
million.
   Earnings at the American Express Bank fell to $31.7
million. The bank said income from commercial services and
personal financial services for the rich and their businesses
rose 15% to $27 million.
   In the six months, American Express as a whole had a loss
of $300.2 million, or 75 cents a share, compared with profit
of $568 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Sales
dropped 2.1% to $11.97 billion from $12.22 billion. The
company said the loss was largely attributable to the
restructuring and operating losses that Shearson recorded in
the first quarter.
