   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Mentor Graphics Corp., as expected,
reported a sharp drop in earnings and a dip in revenue for
its second quarter.
   On July 3, Mentor, which makes software used by engineers,
said it expected to post a disappointing quarter because of a
slowdown in orders caused, in part, by competitors' fierce
pricing.
