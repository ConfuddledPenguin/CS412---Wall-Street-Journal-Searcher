   So you're finally going on vacation. Along with the golf
clubs, tennis racket and swimsuit, you might pack a
calculator, copies of your 1989 tax returns, and your 1990
financial records.
   Summer is a great time to do some planning that could
lower your tax bite next April, or at least make it easier to
pay what you owe.

   "People wait until the last minute and it becomes a crisis
situation," says George E.L. Barbee, executive director of
personal financial services for accountants Price Waterhouse.
"If you (plan) in July, you get yourself into a feeling of
being in control."
   There are, of course, some major unknowns. Some members of
Congress are pushing to raise the top tax rate to at least
33% from 28%. President Bush himself has backed away from his
"no new taxes" pledge. There also is talk of lowering the tax
rate on capital gains.
   But the pros say uncertainty about what's happening in
Washington is no excuse for not planning. "Work up some
reasonable estimates for what the year is going to be like,
and factor in changes that are likely to happen," suggests
Edward D. McCarthy, a financial planner in Providence, R.I.
   Here are several areas taxpayers can think about in their
midyear review:
                                                                                                       

   INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS: The first task probably is to
estimate annual income and deductions. In the past,
especially before tax-law changes of the past few years, it
was common for financial planners to advise clients to defer
income and accelerate deductions, so they would pay the
lowest possible tax. This year, with all the talk about
possible tax increases, it may be worthwhile to consider the
opposite strategy.
   Tax "rates certainly are not going to get any lower," says
Martha L. Jay, a tax partner with accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick. And if rates go up, any deductions will be taken
against higher rates.
   People who own their own businesses and self-employed
professionals are usually the ones with the discretion to
accelerate income. But many salaried employees have
flexibility with deductions, such as medical expenses and
charitable donations. Estimating medical expenses, for
example, can make a difference; they're deductible only if
they total 7.5% or more of adjusted gross income. You may
want to defer expenses if they aren't going to reach that
total, or push them into the current year if it's close.
   But while it's important to plan, financial advisers say
you can wait until later in the year, when the tax outlook is
more certain, to take action. "It's a matter of projecting
what this year is going to look like, when there's plenty of
time left to set things in motion," says Judy Walsh, national
director of executive financial planning for accountants
Deloitte &amp; Touche.
                                                                                                       

   ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX: A good estimate of annual income
also helps a taxpayer know whether the alternative minimum
tax will be a factor this year. Under that tax, a taxpayer
pays at a rate of 21% but loses many deductions, such as for
state and local income and property taxes.
   The tax is usually triggered by big deductions for such
things as certain interest payments or charitable donations
of appreciated property; calculations are based on a ratio of
income to deductions. Taxpayers who may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax usually want to accelerate income and
defer deductions.
   It may pay to think beyond 1990, however. Waiting until
next April to pay state and local taxes on a big capital gain
this year, for instance, could increase your 1991 deductions
enough to trigger the alternative minimum tax for the 1991
federal taxes.
                                                                                                       

   CAPITAL GAINS: Despite movement in Washington toward
lowering the capital gains tax rate, financial advisers
generally recommend that investors base their decisions on
economic considerations rather than possible changes in the
tax law. Capital gains currently are taxed at the same rates
as ordinary income.
   There are too many questions about "when and if and how"
the rate would be lowered, says Ms. Jay of Peat Marwick. For
instance, she says, it's possible that assets purchased
before a new law is passed wouldn't be eligible for a lower
rate. Her advice: "The investment decision should clearly
govern."
                                                                                                       

   DEBT: Just 10% of interest on credit cards and other
consumer debt is deductible this year, and none of it will be
deductible next year. Mortgage interest, investment interest
and interest on home equity loans as much as $100,000
generally are fully deductible.
   For the most part, financial planners advise paying off as
much consumer debt as possible, as well as converting
consumer debt into debt with deductible interest. A home
equity loan could be used to pay off a car loan, for example,
or borrowing for investment purposes could replace borrowing
for consumer items.
                                                                                                       

   WITHHOLDING: Think about any significant changes in your
life -- a baby, a bigger mortgage -- and adjust the amount
withheld from your paycheck. Overwithholding amounts to an
interest-free loan to the government; having too little
withheld means a big tax bill in the spring.
   Changing the amount withheld from your paycheck requires
filling out a new form W-4 for your employer. The form
includes a table to help calculate the number of exemptions
that is appropriate. The Internal Revenue Service also offers
Publication 919 ("Is My Withholding Correct for 1990?") to
help taxpayers compare the amount they are having withheld
with their estimated total annual tax.
   Don't forget adjustments for state and local taxes, which
aren't automatically made with changes in federal
withholding. Most state forms also have tables to help
calculate the appropriate number of exemptions.
                                                                                                       

   RECORD KEEPING: Many people discover when they're filing
their tax returns in April, or worse yet, when they're
audited months later, that they don't have critical receipts
for a business trip or documentation for a charitable
donation. "Just keeping records is important," says Ms. Jay.
Even a shoe box is fine, she says, if it's a "record keeping
system that's easy to maintain and you're going to keep."
   People who travel a lot should have a system for keeping
receipts and other documents accumulated while on the road.
Mr. Barbee of Price Waterhouse, for instance, says he keeps a
separate file folder in his briefcase.
   Midyear tax planning "gets people thinking about doing
some planning all year 'round," says Mr. Barbee. While you're
at it, he suggests, talk to your spouse about retirement and
estate planning. "Many couples don't get that much time
together, except on vacation," he says.
