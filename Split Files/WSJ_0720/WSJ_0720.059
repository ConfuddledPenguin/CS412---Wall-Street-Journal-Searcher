   A proposal to establish a national libel law will be
considered today by a group appointed by the nation's
governors to draft model legislation that can be adopted in
any state.
   The so-called Uniform Defamation Act would establish a
nationwide system for resolving libel disputes by placing the
emphasis on determining the truth or falsity of a statement
rather than on awarding damages.

   Over the past five years, lawyers have made several
proposals to change libel law. But this is the first major
effort to draft and implement uniform state libel
legislation.
   Media defense lawyers say that defending a libel suit is
extremely expensive. And plaintiffs' lawyers complain that
the current system doesn't adequately protect citizens from
harm to their reputations.
   Under the proposed act, libel trials would be divided into
two stages. The first would be limited solely to the question
of the truth or falsity of the disputed statements. Only in
the second stage would the question of damage awards be
addressed and the media allowed to raise constitutional
defenses.
   News organizations could limit their liability by offering
to publish a retraction and pay plaintiffs' legal fees at the
end of the first stage of the trial.
   Supporters of the draft say libel trials tend to place
less emphasis on truth than on issues such as whether the
plaintiff is a public figure or the defendant acted with
malice.
   "The law is designed to provide someone a means of
receiving vindication for reputational harm. It turns the law
on its head to in effect eliminate the question of falsity,"
says Randall P. Bezanson, dean of Washington and Lee
University School of Law and a draftsman of the bill.
   But media defense lawyers have greeted the proposal with
alarm. In a report prepared by members of the Libel Defense
Resource Center, defense lawyers said the proposed
legislation would allow plaintiffs to circumvent
constitutional privileges the media has under the First
Amendment and a line of U.S. Supreme Court cases.
   The bill rests on the assumption that "what most libel
plaintiffs want is a quick setting-of-the-record straight and
not damages. That has not been my experience," says Lee
Levine of the Washington firm of Ross, Dixon &amp; Masback, who
worked on the report.
   While no one is certain that plaintiffs would settle for a
retraction and legal fees, "the bill would give them the
option to stop" the litigation, says John J. Walsh of the New
York law firm of Cadwalader Wickersham &amp; Taft, who has
represented plaintiffs in libel suits.
   The 350-member National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws will discuss the bill and consider
changes. A vote is not expected before next year.
   Harvey S. Perlman, dean of the University of Nebraska
College of Law and chairman of the drafting committee, says
he expects to hear "whether we're marching along the right
path or if it's so offensive we should change directions or
give up."
