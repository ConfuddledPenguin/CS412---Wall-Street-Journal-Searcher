   Your May 16 page-one article on the return of the Cornish
language says, "Only one other lost tongue has been
successfully revived to everyday use -- Hebrew -- and it had
the full weight of the state of Israel behind it."
   Hebrew was never a lost language in the sense that Cornish
was. While Hebrew fell from conversational use for more than
a thousand years, throughout that time it continued to be the
language of religion, study and intellectual dialogue, much
as Latin had been in Western civilization up to the 16th
century. All educated Jews could read and speak at least
enough Hebrew to get by in synagogue. It did not require "the
full weight of the state of Israel" to bring it back to
colloquial use, but, like the Cornish, only the will of the
people who lived there.
