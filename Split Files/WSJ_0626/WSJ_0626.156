   HONOLULU -- Hawaiian Airlines said it filed suits aimed at
blocking a competitor, Discovery Airways.
   The HAL Inc. unit said it is seeking to recover $9.9
million in alleged damages and asking for a federal
investigation of the air carrier, which it claims is
un-American because of its reliance on Japanese loans.

   In a two-pronged litigation, Hawaiian Airlines filed one
suit in federal court charging that Discovery violated the
Federal Aviation Act, and another suit in the First Circuit
Court of Hawaii charging Discovery with unfair competition.
   Hawaiian's attempt to stop its rival's operations is based
on an assertion that Discovery is "foreign owned, and
therefore not an American corporation."
   Discovery officials couldn't immediately be reached for
comment. Discovery was formed last summer by ex-airline
executives who announced they wanted to enter the
inter-island air carrier business.
   Hawaiian claims it has lost $3.3 million in revenue since
Discovery began operations and asks the state court to award
it that amount in actual damages, plus an additional $6.6
million in general and punitive damages.
   In addition, Hawaiian says it will ask the Justice
Department to investigate Discovery's actions before the
Department of Transportation.
   HAL has weathered a turbulent year so far. Former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth completed his $37 million
takeover of HAL in January. In April, the company disclosed
plunging passenger traffic on Hawaiian Airlines in the wake
of extended aircraft downtime and reduced capacity on
inter-island routes.
   As a result, HAL posted a loss of $46.9 million, or $24 a
share, for 1989, more than five times the year-earlier loss
of $8.8 million, or $4.48 a share.
