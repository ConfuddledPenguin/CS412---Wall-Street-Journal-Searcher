   Much of the best British fiction since the war has been
written by people from the margins of the old empire --
Trinidad, India or Africa -- but over the past 15 years there
have emerged some native English novelists who have attracted
much deserved attention. Though different from each other in
important ways, Bruce Chatwin, Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and
Ian McEwan share an unmistakable doomsday glow. They all emit
a whiff of the grave and meditate upon Last Things.
   In this, their godfathers are Evelyn Waugh, the master of
malice, and Graham Greene, the master of seediness -- Roman
Catholic novelists and travel writers whose exceptionally
clear colloquial prose conveyed their fascination with
failure, innocence and betrayal, socialites, criminals and
scruffy saints. But these four younger writers all are
stylistically more complex than Waugh or Greene and none of
them appears to share his ancestors' religious faith. There
is damnation, but no redeemer. No Christ, no Marx, no Freud.

   Bruce Chatwin began as a travel writer with the remarkable
"In Patagonia" (1977), and then turned to narratives often
marked by an opposition between exotic innocence and modern
civilization. Martin Amis began as a fairly conventional
social satirist, but soon created the frenzied, dark
millennial vision seen most recently in "London Fields."
Julian Barnes also began as satirist but has developed into a
great original: His masterpiece, "Flaubert's Parrot" (1984),
was followed by two equally inventive fictional experiments
upon "memento mori". Ian McEwan, whose eighth book, "The
Innocent" (Doubleday, 271 pages, $18.95), has just been
published, began as a specialist in adolescent torment and
perversion, but has become a considerably more complex
figure.
   The opening story in Mr. McEwan's first book, "First Love,
Last Rites," which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976 and
established its 28-year-old author as a dour "enfant
terrible", was narrated by a 14-year-old who seemed an
English cousin of Holden Caulfield's: "This may have been one
of the most desolate couplings known to copulating mankind,
involving lies, deceit, humiliation, incest, my partner
falling asleep, my gnat's orgasm and the sobbing which now
filled the bedroom, but I was pleased with it. . . . I had
made it into the adult world finally. . . ."
   The nasty precision of the prose and equally nasty
obsessive undertow proved to be characteristic of much of Mr.
McEwan's work -- two volumes of stories, four novels, a
collection of television plays and an oratorio. His fiction
is filled with adolescent incest and violent regression, a
taste for sordid acts described in a cool, disquieting manner
that is never merely precious or snobbish. His short stories
often run to clinical monologues or confessions, but his
novels are more varied and relaxed and show notable
development.
   His first novel, "The Cement Garden" (1978), depicted the
macabre incestuous regression of four working-class London
orphans left to themselves in the course of a summer. His
second, "The Comfort of Strangers" (1981), smoothly recounted
the destruction of an English couple on a Venetian holiday at
the hands of a sado-masochistic husband and wife.
   His third novel, "The Child in Time" (1987), was a great
surprise. Its account of a London children's-book writer who
has lost his three-year-old daughter and struggles to regain
his own lost childhood and family -- to recapture time, to
reenter the continuity of generations -- was thematically
richer and technically more impressive than Mr. McEwan's
earlier work. Its large psychological themes were combined
with perfectly pitched social satire and lush physical
descriptions. His familiar theme of regression was developed
in a grander, more emotionally and intellectually ambitious
context than before. "The Child in Time" was touching in
unexpected ways, and it remains impressive.
   Mr. McEwan's new novel, "The Innocent," marks a
deliberately popular turn in his work. It uses the action and
setting of a spy novel -- espionage in Berlin in the midst of
the Cold War -- to explore the perils of English postwar
innocence abroad and to celebrate education (personal,
sexual, political) as a fortunate, if grisly fall.
   But "The Innocent" is never less than a wholly
entertaining spy novel. In Berlin in 1955 the mutually
suspicious British and American intelligence forces
constructed a tunnel into the Russian sector in order to tap
Soviet phone lines. This is all true and meticulously
described in the best techno-thriller way -- we learn about
circuit diagrams, nitrogen-filled cables and 150
signal-activated Ampex tape recorders monitoring 172
circuits. The hero of the novel is a naive, awkward
25-year-old telephone technician who works in a minor way on
this complex project. He is "handed over" to the Americans
because of our "special relationship" and is repelled,
embarrassed and attracted by the freedom of American
feelings, manners and popular culture: rock 'n' roll "at the
outer limit of effort and joy," the "jubilant uncoiling
power" of Americans playing catch.
   At the same time, his sexual initiation and difficulties
with an older German woman are carefully interwoven with
these transatlantic matters -- as are the themes of secrecy,
intimacy and betrayal, vulnerability and power, war and rape.
The last third of the novel turns into an expertly
constructed, bloody horror show as the tunnel, the hero's own
buried violence, his girlfriend's loving body, and the corpse
of her drunken former husband are brought together with the
suspense and precision of a strong Hitchcock film, or a novel
by Graham Greene.
