   Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it expects to report a strong
second quarter, exceeding its year-ago profit of $7.2
million, or 63 cents a share.
   The company said its first half performance should top the
year-ago period, when the construction and engineering
concern posted profit of $13.6 million, or $1.19 a share.

   Order backlog at the end of the second quarter ending June
30 should exceed $3 billion, up from $2.6 billion at the end
of the first quarter, the company said.
   The Boise, Idaho, company said its engineering and
construction activities will be strong for the quarter, while
its rail systems group will be adversely affected by start-up
problems on a transit car contract with New York City.
