   WASHINGTON -- U.S. newsprint consumption last month rose
3.2% to 1.070 million metric tons from 1.037 million metric
tons in May 1989, according to preliminary estimates by the

   The industry group said U.S. daily newspapers used 793,154
metric tons of newsprint in May, up 1.7% from 780,228 metric
tons a year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.

Consumption by daily newspapers for the first five months of
