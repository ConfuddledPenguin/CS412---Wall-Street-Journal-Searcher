   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency, in a
draft report likely to spur wider bans on smoking in the
workplace, proposed that second-hand smoke be declared a
known human carcinogen.
   The agency also issued a draft guide to workplace smoking
policies that recommends that passive smoking be eliminated
wherever possible and measures the effectiveness of various
methods of reducing worker exposure to smoking. Among its
findings, the guide, which includes case studies of companies
that have reduced worker exposure, says that cutting passive
smoking can cut costs.

   The proposal, which was expected, would put second-hand
smoke in a class with such pollutants as asbestos. The agency
estimates that passive smoke causes 3,800 additional lung
cancer deaths annually. These include 2,500 adults who never
smoked and 1,300 former smokers.
   The report didn't break new scientific ground and didn't
chronicle the effect of second-hand smoke on other ailments
such as heart disease and other forms of cancer, although
several reports recently have linked it to these illnesses.
The report did say that absorption of tobacco smoke can be
particularly harmful for children.
   The EPA itself can't regulate smoking, but the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to
use the report as a means of raising the issue of workplace
exposure. While anti-smoking groups expect the report to
bolster their efforts to ban smoking from the workplace, the
tobacco industry is also hard at work to thwart such moves.
Philip Morris Cos., for example, has been touting studies
that find exposure to second-hand smoke far less harmful than
the EPA report states.
   In a statement yesterday, the Tobacco Institute said the
EPA "has contributed to the speculative process of ascribing
risk where a sound scientific basis is lacking" and predicted
that the risk assessment would result in "fear and
confusion."
   The draft workplace guide states that prohibiting smoking
indoors is the best way to reduce exposure but notes that
this is inconvenient for smokers. To be effective, designated
smoking areas must have a separate ventilation system so that
air from the room isn't circulated throughout the building,
and provide far greater amounts of outdoor air for each
smoker than offices typically supply.
   Two common strategies, separating smokers from nonsmokers
with a wall or within the same room, won't eliminate
tobacco-smoke pollution although they can cut exposure,
according to the guidebook. The document also says various
devices used to clean air, including filters and ion
generators, may effectively remove particles found in tobacco
smoke but don't effectively reduce gaseous pollutants.
   One strategy that doesn't work particularly well is
allowing smokers and nonsmokers to use the same space at
different times. The guidelines state that people entering
room hours after smoking occurred will still be exposed to
the harmful particles and gases found in tobacco smoke.
   The guidebook says company smoking policies need the
support of management and should be developed with employee
and labor union participation. Smoking-cessation programs
also should be made available to smokers who want to quit.
   The guidebook, prepared for the EPA by the nonprofit
Smoking Policy Institute in Seattle, and the risk-assessment
report are being released for public comment on their
technical and policy contents.
