   TORONTO -- Canadian financial markets recovered from an
initial sell-off yesterday following the demise of the Meech
Lake constitutional accord.
   Analysts said a rebound in the Canadian dollar triggered a
positive response in the bond and equity markets. They
predicted that Canada's relatively attractive interest-rate
yields will continue to support the Canadian dollar in coming
weeks, overriding lingering anxieties about the future of the
Canadian union.

   "The wide interest-rate spreads {between Canada and the
U.S.} look ever more attractive now that the Canadian debate
about the Meech Lake accord has gone out of the air," said
Edward Carmichael, an economist at Burns Fry Ltd. in Toronto.
   The Meech Lake accord, aimed at meeting demands of mostly
French-speaking Quebec and defusing independence forces in
the province, failed over the weekend after two provincial
legislatures adjourned without ratifying the proposed
constitutional amendment.
   Yesterday, Montreal was a sea of blue-and-white Quebec
flags as a good-natured crowd of about 200,000 watched a
parade marking St. Jean Baptiste Day, the French-speaking
province's "national" holiday. Lined up 10 deep in places
along the three-mile route, Montrealers smiled and waved and
at times chanted, "We want a country. We want a country."
   Canadian market sentiment was boosted by a report that
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its Triple-A rating on
Canadian government debt and Double-A-minus rating on
Quebec's debt. Moody's Investors Service Inc. also said it
would maintain its Double-A-3 rating on Quebec debt.
   But Standard &amp; Poor's said it changed its outlook for
Quebec's long-term debt to "developing" from "positive"
because of political uncertainty. "While S&amp;P expects no
change in the relationship between Quebec and Canada in the
near term, ongoing discussions of constitutional reform could
become increasingly divisive," the rating agency said.
   The Canadian dollar began the trading day in Asia, falling
swiftly to 84.20 cents from 84.85 cents late Friday in
Toronto. But it ended higher at 84.95 cents.
   The Canadian 20-year bellwether bond ended down 1/2 point,
or 50 Canadian dollars lower for every C$1,000 face amount,
to 10.62%. But with U.S. bonds also falling, the Canadian
issue improved against its American counterpart, narrowing
its premium over the U.S. 30-year bellwether bond to 206
basis points from 209 basis points on Friday. A basis point
is a hundredth of a percentage point.
   Canadian equities also declined but by little more than
the U.S. stocks measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-composite index lost 16.56
points to 3474.16 points. Volume was light at 15.5 million
shares.
