   DAYTON, Ohio -- Philips Industries Inc. set Aug. 6 for a
special shareholder meeting to vote on the company's proposed
acquisition by Tomkins PLC.
   London-based Tomkins signed a definitive agreement on June
15 to acquire Philips for $18.50 a share, or $550 million,
after the collapse earlier this year of a leveraged buy-out
of Philips by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.
