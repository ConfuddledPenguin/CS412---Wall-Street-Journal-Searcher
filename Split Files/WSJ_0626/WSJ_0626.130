   International Business Machines Corp.'s scheduled
announcement today of a new home computer is stirring up the
computer market as only IBM can.
   Computer makers who are chasing the elusive home market
say IBM's attempt to make the machines easy to use, even for
novices, makes some sense. Dealers and consultants add that
IBM's prices are reasonably aggressive and that it seems to
have thought through many of the delicate marketing issues.
As a result, it appears that IBM has at least a limited
success on its hands.

   At the same time, as IBM provided details of the new
machines' "specs" to reporters in interviews yesterday, some
competitors and consultants disparaged the new computers'
capabilities and raised the specter of the PCjr, IBM's
much-ridiculed and unsuccessful attempt to crack the home
market in the mid-1980s. The competitors and consultants
especially argued that it is too awkward to add circuit
boards to the new machines to expand their computing power.
   "These machines are all marketing and no technology," says
Fred Davis, director of the testing laboratory at PC
Magazine, one of the trade publications whose reviews
influence the sales of personal-computer products.
   As widely expected, the announcement says the machines use
the moderately powerful Intel Corp. 80286 processor. List
prices for the line will run from $1,000 to $2,000 and the
systems will range from a computer with a black-and-white
monitor and no hard disk drive to a computer with a color
monitor and a 30-megabyte hard disk. Actual selling prices
will be somewhat lower than list prices, but discounts may be
only half the size of the 25% discounts that are common on
most personal computers.
   All the systems will have a fairly fast modem for talking
with other computers across phone lines. In addition, IBM is
including the software for the Prodigy videotext service that
it and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. have set up for users to shop by
computer and to gather information electronically.
   The new IBM computers also include a "mouse" pointing
device, for moving the cursor around the screen, and
Microsoft Works, a software package that lets users do a
little bit of everything from word processing to spreadsheets
and data bases. Some of the basic software is loaded in
chips, so the system actually presents the user with a
meaningful screen as soon as it is turned on instead of just
staring back blankly.
   IBM will sell the machines through many of its current
dealers. But it also is taking a bold gamble and will attempt
to sell the complex machines through department stores. The
company says computers should become as ubiquitous as
microwave ovens and video cassette records and thus will need
to be distributed the same way as appliances. It adds that
most of its regular dealers aren't open when people are
buying home computers -- Thursday and Friday nights and on
weekends.
   IBM says it will sell through nearly 1,000 Sears,
Dayton-Hudson and Dillard stores nationwide when the new
machines become widely available in September. This summer,
as a sort of shakedown cruise, IBM will sell limited
quantities through those department stores and dealers in
Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Dallas-Fort Worth.
   IBM will toss in more service than is generally available
for home computers. It will promise to replace faulty
hardware within 48 hours, for instance. The company also will
offer extensive facilities for people to dial into the
Prodigy service to get answers to questions such as how to
use the software that comes with the system.
   IBM also promises not to point any fingers at the
developers of the software, either; one of the biggest
headaches in getting service these days seems to be that
every company a user calls blames a problem on someone else
who made some of the system's hardware or software.
   "It's the wrong approach to expect people to become
computer-literate," says Alan Hald, chairman of MicroAge
Inc., a big computer chain. "It makes much more sense to make
computers human-literate, and IBM seems to be taking some
steps in that direction."
   There are also some consumer trends that seem to be
working in IBM's favor. Link Resources Corp., a
market-research firm, says the number of U.S. households with
a personal computer is growing 10% a year. Only about 40% of
that market currently is taken by IBM-compatible machines but
that percentage is expected to grow considerably, as people
take more work home from the IBM-compatible machines they use
at the office.
   Jim Cannavino, the general manager of IBM's
personal-computer and workstation group, is even more
optimistic than Link. He says that 20 million U.S. households
now have PCs and that the number could double within five
years.
   "The home market is too big to ignore," he says.
   Still, IBM may face a withering series of comparisons by
competitors on price and performance. IBM-compatible "clones"
that are somewhat more powerful than the new machines
currently are available for at least $400 less than IBM's
most powerful system. In addition, these clones include
so-called expansion slots for additional circuit boards that
can, for example, let the computer also function as a
facsimile machine. IBM's new systems, called the PS/1 line,
have most of the features that normally require a slot
already built in, but anyone wanting to go beyond these
features must buy a $169 piece of hardware that includes
three open slots.
   "You have to give people a way to expand," complains Tim
Bajarin, a consultant at Creative Strategies Research
International. "The PC magazines are going to have a field
day with this."
   IBM also could run into some snags with its customer
service. While extensive, the service requires that people be
comfortable dialing into an electronic system that might
confound a novice computer user.
   There are potential problems with IBM's existing dealers,
too. Matt Fitzsimmons, owner of a ComputerLand store in White
Plains, N.Y., says he likes the new system but adds that
"dealers' greatest fear is that someone will come in and make
you explain how this differs from everything else in IBM's
product line -- and then go off and buy the machine at a
lower price from one of the mass merchandisers."
   Even if the PS/1 becomes a rip-roaring success,
consultants say competitors such as Tandy Corp. should do
well, too. "I think IBM will generate a lot of interest at
the low end," says Bobby Orbach, who recently founded a
computer and software marketing consulting firm. "Not only
will IBM sell a lot of boxes, but other companies will, too."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM
rose 37.5 cents to $116.625.
