   LOS ANGELES -- Southern Natural Gas Co. agreed to pay
Atlantic Richfield Co. $300.5 million to settle a lawsuit for
damages resulting from an accident last year on an Arco
offshore drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Seven workers were killed and 23 injured in the March 19,
1989, fire and explosion on Arco's South Pass "B" platform.

   An Arco spokesman said he didn't know when or how the
$300.5 million would be paid. The settlement came during a
recess of the trial of a suit brought by Arco in April
against Sonat, two of its affiliates and Pipe Lines Unlimited
Services, Houma, La. The trial began June 11 in state court
in Texas.
   In the suit, Arco charged Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat and
Pipe Lines Unlimited, an oil transportation concern, with
negligence that caused the fire. Sonat's pipeline was
connected to Arco's platform.
   The pact resolves all of Arco's claims against Sonat, the
Arco spokesman said, including damages to the platform and
lost production. Prior to the accident, the platform produced
about 18,000 barrels a day, the spokesman said. It has
remained shut since then.
   The settlement assigns Arco's claims against Pipe Lines
Unlimited to Sonat, the Arco spokesman said. Separate
settlements were reached earlier, he said, between Sonat and
families of the accident victims.
