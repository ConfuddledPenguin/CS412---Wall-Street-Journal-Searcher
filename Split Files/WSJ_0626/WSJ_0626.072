   Gold prices rose after South African Reserve Bank Governor
Chris L. Stals disclosed that the bank has actively supported
the market in recent weeks.
   That disclosure, along with another that Brazil has been
selling a lot of gold this year, briefly illuminated some of
the behind-the-scenes machinations in the global gold market.
But though traders found the information interesting, many
didn't think such intervention efforts would affect long-term
price trends.

   Yesterday in London, gold rose $3 an ounce to $351.40 in
the morning fixing and then $2 more to $353.40 in the
afternoon fixing. On New York's Commodity Exchange, futures
contracts rose $3.40 an ounce, with the June delivery
finishing at $353.80.
   South Africa's Reserve Bank entered the market following
large-scale sales by a Middle Eastern bank earlier this month
that pushed prices as low as $340 an ounce, Mr. Stals said in
an interview with Dow Jones International News Service at a
gold conference in Venice.
   Gold tumbled June 14 when the National Commercial Bank of
Jeddah dumped several tons on the London market. But the
price partially recovered later that day after buying by
central banks, according to London dealers.
   Mr. Stals said South Africa's central bank would continue
to support gold if further big sales threaten to push prices
sharply lower. But, he acknowledged, "We cannot do too much
because we do not have the foreign-exchange reserves at our
disposal."
   Besides direct purchases by South Africa, the Bank of
England also could have bought gold on behalf of the Soviet
Union, said Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch
Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith in London. As the largest gold
producers, South Africa and the Soviet Union have a vested
interest in stopping prices from falling, he said. Moreover
large quantities of their gold are deposited as collateral
with Western banks, he said, and lenders don't want the
security for loans to collapse.
   Meanwhile, at the same Venice conference, it was learned
that Brazil's central bank has sold about 100 metric tons of
gold for dollars on the world market so far this year. Emilio
Garofalo Filho, director of the central bank's department for
international reserves operations, said the sales were part
of a gold-for-dollars arbitrage program implemented by the
Brazilian government in February. The aim, he said, was to
reduce gold smuggling operations, which accounts for more
than 50% of the country's gold output.
   Brazil is attempting to stop smugglers from illegally
taking gold out of the country, selling it for hard currency
and then leaving the proceeds deposited abroad. To remove the
incentive for smuggling bullion out of the country, Brazil
has been buying gold domestically -- in local currency,
cruzeiros -- at above-market prices. The central bank then
unloads the bullion on world markets.
   However, international bankers said that Brazil's central
bank at times also intervened in global bullion markets to
support the price of gold. Brazil's major motive, said the
bankers, is to buoy gold prices just long enough to allow the
central bank to take advantage of gold's firmness and dispose
of some of its excess holdings at higher prices.
   Betty Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said Mr.
Stals's disclosure should come as no surprise. "When we had
the last big sell-off, there were rumors at that time that
central banks were prepared to intervene in the market at
some price level," she said.
   Ms. Raptopoulos also noted that the announcement last week
of a $3 billion loan from West Germany to the Soviet Union
could be positive for the market. "This loan could reduce the
Soviet need to sell gold in order to pay Western creditors,"
she said.
   August Arace, co-manager of the Freedom Gold &amp; Government
Trust, an open-ended mutual fund that specializes in
government debt instruments, bullion and gold mining shares,
said he has long assumed that central banks in South Africa,
the Soviet Union and, on occasion, the United Kingdom, enter
the gold market from time to time to make purchases to
support prices. But he added, "Make no mistake about these
moves. They are short-term, and there is no evidence that
they have ever been able to change the direction of a trend."
Mr. Arace added that in a rising market, these banks may also
sell to capitalize on such a move. "In such cases they sell
to gain foreign exchange."
   Although central banks hold about 29,000 tons of gold,
they don't take concerted action to support the price,
bullion dealers said. Some trade gold, however, and depending
on the price, buy or sell marginal quantities.
   To be sure, central banks sold an estimated 280 tons last
year, said Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., a London bullion bank. South
Africa was among the sellers, disposing of 12 tons, the bank
said. Belgium sold 127 tons, Mexico 47 tons and Canada 32
tons.
   The South African Reserve Bank became more active in the
bullion market during the past few years, a London bullion
manager said. It makes use of the options and futures market
and sometimes withholds supplies or purchases a few tons of
gold to stabilize the market, the bullion manager said.
   But because it isn't in a position to buy significant
quantities, he said, it pays for the bank to publicize
possible purchase intentions to ward off potential sellers.
   Mr. Arace of the Freedom Gold fund said gold prices have
been in a downward price trend for the past 10 years. "I
think the outlook for gold is negative," he said. "There is a
real question in my mind when the bull trend will resume."
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures for July
delivery rose sharply in active trading on fears that a heat
wave spreading across the Midwest this week may damage the
recently planted soybean crop and reduce yields at harvest
time. July soybean futures jumped 13.25 cents a bushel to
close at $6.1275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. July
corn futures prices also climbed in step with the rising
thermometer, adding five cents a bushel to close at $2.87 a
bushel. Late plantings for both crops in many areas because
of above-average rainfall this spring resulted in shallow
root systems that could be damaged by the early summer heat
wave, said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co. in
Chicago. Temperatures will shoot into the 90s this week
across Iowa and other Midwestern growing regions as a high
pressure ridge spreads into the area from the Southwest, said
Harvey Freese, co-founder of FreeseNotis Weather Inc. in Des
Moines, Iowa. But Mr. Freese said his company predicts that
cooler, wetter weather will return to much of the Midwest as
early as next week. The soybean rally appeared to be based on
traders "jumping to the conclusion" that this year's wet and
cool spring will be followed by a long, hot summer, which
happened most recently in 1983, Mr. Freese said. Next week's
forecast ought to cloud such predictions, he indicated.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices at the New York
Mercantile Exchange declined despite a rally during the final
half-hour of trading. Volume was exceptionally light. High
inventory levels have damped buying enthusiasm in recent
days. Only technical factors have kept prices from descending
lower. Even reports that oil workers might strike Sunday and
shut down Norway's operations in the North Sea did little to
prompt buying. In the gasoline and heating oil pits, however,
prices advanced slightly over Friday's levels.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined in reaction to slowing
auto sales and an expected sluggish summer economy, some
analysts said. According to Prudential-Bache's Ms.
Raptopoulos, the market has been swept with rumors concerning
the London Metals Exchange inventory figure, which will be
released this morning. Initially, it was projected that
stocks would begin a sharp rise with today's numbers, but
later traders were expecting stocks to be unchanged. The
market should have been buoyed by stories that the labor
negotiations between Asarco and its union aren't going well,
said Ms. Raptopoulos. The contract expires at the end of the
month. And a senior vice president at a major wire producer
said his industry is experiencing a serious contraction. "It
started in mid-May, and now it is hitting us right square
between the eyes," he said. He said distributors to whom his
company sells wires tell him that their customers are being
squeezed by a credit crunch. He also pointed out that major
U.S. copper producers who had been buying copper from others
to fill customers' orders are no longer doing so. "I expect
some of this copper to wind up in {New York's Commodity
Exchange} warehouses." That means producers would be
delivering copper against contracts they had sold on the
Comex rather than buying the contracts back to nullify them,
which would buoy prices. Short sellers can deliver a physical
commodity to fulfill a contract sold short.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices continued the rally they started on Friday.
Because yesterday was the first day holders of short
positions in the July contract could give notice that they
intend to make delivery, the contract traded without the
usual two-cents a pound daily limit. The July contract gained
2.27 cents a pound to finish at 84.77 cents. The October
contract, which bridges the end of one cotton season and the
beginning of another, and the December contract, which
reflects new-season cotton, both rose by less than one cent a
pound. Thomas Mueller, senior cotton analyst at Merrill Lynch
Futures in New York, said the July contract is being driven
by a lack of availability of certificated stocks of cotton
for delivery. "However," he noted, "the October and December
contracts are clearly responding to heat and moisture
problems in west and south Texas." He said these problems
could reduce non-irrigated cotton plantings by as much as
450,000 acres. He said he expects the rally in December
cotton to run out of steam at about the 76-cent level because
"at that price demand for cotton from abroad will diminish
significantly." Mr. Mueller added that domestic and
international mills are suffering from declining margins as
the price of yarn has failed to keep up with the rising price
of raw cotton. "U.S. mills lost $47 million after taxes in
the first quarter. They will do worse in the second." Mr.
Mueller said.
