   NEW YORK -- Faced with falling earnings, Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s newly named top managers said they plan to slash
operating expenses by at least $300 million, or about 8%,
over the next six to 12 months. The move could lead to as
many as 3,000 layoffs, according to some Chase executives.
   In a memo distributed yesterday to all officers, Thomas G.
Labrecque, Chase's chairman-designate, and Arthur F. Ryan,
president-designate, said the $300 million in cutbacks are
prompted by a financial climate that is "as difficult as any
in the history of the global financial-services industry."

   The nation's second-largest banking company hasn't
determined how many jobs will be eliminated out of its global
work force of 41,600 employees.
   The cutbacks are expected to fall across all departments,
though European corporate finance has been identified in
particular as one vulnerable area because of weak profits.
One high Chase officer said, "Nothing will escape the knife."
   The last time Chase made a concerted effort to trim its
payroll was in 1987, when 1,280 employees took early
retirement.
   The memo follows last week's announcement that Willard C.
Butcher, Chase's chairman and chief executive officer, will
retire in September, several months earlier than expected, in
order to give Messrs. Labrecque and Ryan a quicker start on
slimming down Chase.
   In yesterday's memo, which details the first in a series
of expected cost-cutting steps, Chase said that it is wiping
out its three-pronged organizational structure and instead
will have ten business heads reporting directly to Mr. Ryan,
formerly head of consumer banking.
   In effect, the reorganization demotes Vice Chairman Robert
R. Douglass, who moves from head of institutional banking to
a new post as senior customer-planning and development
officer. In addition, Vice Chairman Richard J. Boyle will no
longer oversee global commercial and investment banking, but
instead will be senior credit officer. His responsibilities
will include commercial real estate lending, a troubled area
for Chase and other banks.
   Mr. Douglass, a patrician banker with close ties to the
Rockefeller family, whose members once ran Chase, will serve
in a largely ambassador-at-large role, Chase executives say.
Mr. Douglass was responsible for Chase's acquisition of an
Arizona bank which last year had a $79 million write-off for
bad real estate loans. Mr. Douglass will report to Mr.
Labrecque.
   As head of credit and real estate, Mr. Boyle is being
placed in a sensitive position that he is very familiar with.
During the 1970s, Mr. Boyle was instrumental in Chase's
work-out of troubled real estate loans, which once again are
rising. In addition, Chase executives credit him with
dissuading Mr. Butcher from bidding for Texas Commerce
Bancshares Inc., a troubled bank that was eventually acquired
by Chemical Banking Corp. Mr. Boyle will report to Mr. Ryan.
   A number of other Chase executives gain new
responsibilities in the restructuring. Michael F. Dacey, head
of North American corporate finance, now has securities
underwriting, public finance, leasing and domestic
institutions businesses reporting to him. Timothy McGiniss,
head of corporate finance in Japan, picks up responsibility
for the rest of Asia. Robert Murphy, head of Latin American
corporate finance, is being given responsibility for
developing-country debt.
   Donald Boudreau, head of the New York City branch system,
added Chase's banks in upstate New York, Ohio, Maryland and
elsewhere in the U.S. to his responsibilities. Robert D.
Hunter, head of national financial services, will now have
the residential mortgage business reporting to him.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
shares closed yesterday at $24.125 apiece, up 50 cents.
