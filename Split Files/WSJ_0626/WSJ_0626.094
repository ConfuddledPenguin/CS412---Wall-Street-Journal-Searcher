   WASHINGTON -- South African activist Nelson Mandela, in a
meeting with President Bush, asked the U.S. to provide
financial support to the anti-apartheid African National
Congress, but the administration said it rejected the
request.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said the president told Mr. Mandela, the ANC's
deputy president, that the U.S. wouldn't directly provide
funds to any political parties in South Africa.

   On other topics, Mr. Cohen said the president welcomed a
statement by Mr. Mandela that the ANC would call for a
cessation of hostilities when it begins negotiations with the
South African government. Mr. Bush had wanted the ANC leader
to go further and renounce all violence.
   Mr. Mandela said the ANC decided in 1986 to scale down its
armed "struggle" and pursue negotiations. He said the call to
stop hostilities could come "as soon as the (South African)
government removes all obstacles to negotiations." The
conditions he listed are: the return of 20,000 political
exiles, the release of 1,000 political prisoners, the repeal
of oppressive legislation, the ending of political trials and
the full lifting of the state of emergency.
   The anti-apartheid leader, who is on an eight-city tour of
the U.S., also met yesterday with Secretary of State James
Baker. Today, he is scheduled to address a joint session of
Congress, where he may draw criticism for his indications of
support for Cuban leader Fidel Castro, Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, whom he called "brother leader."
   In a news briefing, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Mandela didn't ask
President Bush yesterday to intensify U.S. sanctions against
the South African government. During a brief airport session
with reporters after his plane landed in Washington on
Sunday, Mr. Mandela had indicated he would make such a
request.
   U.S. sanctions will remain in place until conditions that
are specified in U.S. law -- a full lifting of the South
African state of emergency and the release of political
prisoners -- are met, according to Mr. Cohen.
   At a news conference about two hours after his meeting and
luncheon with the president, Mr. Mandela said the ANC would
use the unspecified amount of funds he requested from Mr.
Bush for "the task of mobilizing the entire country around
the peace process which we, the African National Congress,
have launched." Despite Mr. Cohen's comments, he said "Our
impression is the president was sympathetic to our appeal for
resources."
   Mr. Cohen later indicated that the U.S. this fiscal year
is spending a total of $42 million to aid the people of South
Africa, $32 million for scholarships and $10 million for a
variety of projects. But he added: "There will be no money .
. . directly to the ANC from the United States government."
   Both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Cohen said the two sides narrowed
their differences and reached better understandings on issues
concerning South Africa and the U.S. The president and Mr.
Mandela did "agree to disagree," Mr. Cohen said, on issues
that are peripheral to the task of ending apartheid and
developing South African democracy.
   One such issue is the Bush administration's military
assistance for rebel groups fighting the government of
Angola. Shortly after arriving in Washington, Mr. Mandela
said ANC officials "strongly condemn" that aid.
