   BERISSO, Argentina -- Daniel James picked up the phone to
call a friend in Buenos Aires, about 43 miles away. After
dialing and redialing for almost an hour, Mr. James, a Yale
University professor who is writing a social history of this
working-class town, did what many Argentines frequently do:
He got angry. "What's wrong with the phone?" he screamed.
   Summoning years of experience, his landlady peered out the
window and said: "It's strange. It's not windy today."

   If all goes as planned, a new wind will soon be blowing
for the Argentine phone system. And the government hopes that
instead of knocking the phones out, as wind often does now, a
fresh breeze of private enterprise will finally make them
work.
   Yesterday, the government of President Carlos Menem kicked
off its drive to sell off Argentina's loss-ridden
public-sector companies by receiving the final bids for
Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, or Entel.
   Under the privatization plan, Entel is to be broken into
two companies, one covering the northern half of Argentina
and one the southern half, with each company getting half of
Buenos Aires, where almost two-thirds of the country's 3.2
million lines are installed. The government is selling 60% of
each company, with the remainder to be divided this way: 25%
to the public in stock offerings, 10% to Entel employees, and
5% to local telephone cooperatives. The bidding plan requires
paying a total of $214 million for the two companies,
assuming $380 million in debt, and buying back Argentine
foreign debt with a face value of at least $3.5 billion. The
winner of each company will be the one that delivers the most
debt paper above that minimum. With Argentine debt trading at
12 to 13 cents on the dollar, the minimum represents a
disbursement of between $420 million and $455 million.
   Telefonica S.A. of Spain offered $2.83 billion for the
southern zone of Entel and $2.41 billion for the northern
zone. Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia offered $2.33
billion for the northern zone; it didn't bid on the southern
zone. And STET of Italy offered $2.44 billion for the
southern zone and $2.2 billion for the northern zone. In all
cases, the offers include cash payments of $100 million for
the northern zone and $114 million for the southern zone,
with the rest in the form of assumption of debt and interest
payments.
   The bids far exceeded the government's floor prices for
both zones, blunting previous criticism that the setting of a
debt floor would drive bidders away, though other people had
alleged that Entel is being sold too cheaply.
   The government will announce the winners Thursday. It has
stipulated that no single company can acquire both the
northern and southern zones.
   Telefonica's partners in its bid are Techint of Argentina
and Citicorp, a New York-based bank holding company. Bell
Atlantic's partners include several small Argentine companies
and Manufacturers Hanover Corp., a New York-based banking
concern. Stet's partners include Perez Companc of Argentina,
Cable &amp; Radio of France and J.P. Morgan of New York, a
banking company.
   By July, the government also hopes to have sold Aerolineas
Argentinas and to have started the process to sell several
oil fields run by Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, parts of
the state railway system, road networks and energy plants. By
cutting its links to the inefficient, heavily subsidized,
public-sector industries, the government hopes to get rid of
an annual $5.5 billion drain on its finances, cut its $64
billion foreign debt by encouraging debt-for-equity swaps,
and show foreign investors it means business.
   For a Peronist government, such a U-turn from the statist
dogma of Juan Domingo Peron is revolutionary, says Jorge
Bustamante, a banker. But President Menem's clearance sale is
dictated more by necessity than conviction.
   With the country in the midst of a deep recession, the
near-bankrupt government has no alternative but to sell
assets if it wants to put its house in order. "There's
nowhere to get money," a foreign banker involved in the
privatization process says. "They can't finance themselves
from foreign creditors, there's nothing much left to
confiscate domestically, and they can't finance themselves
with inflation, because they would go straight to
hyperinflation. They need to do so much so quickly to really
restore confidence."
   The process is moving so quickly that, as is typical in
Argentina, it is confusing and messy. Bidders bow out. Rules
change in mid-process. Officials resign. Unions and
politicians obfuscate. As sale day approaches for Aerolineas
Argentinas, nobody knows how many bidders there will be -- or
even if there will be any. Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines has bowed out, and other bidders --
including Alitalia Airlines, Varig Brazilian Airlines, KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines and Iberia Air Lines of Spain -- have
requested more time.
   What's more, those who are bidding aren't quite sure what
they will get. "The idea is to privatize as quickly as
possible, rather than the best they can," says Roberto Ruiz,
international director of Banco Rio de La Plata and chairman
of Argentina Development Trust Co., a $1.3 billion debt fund
set up by 21 international banks to invest in the
privatization program.
   But Mr. Menem, wary of the credibility problem that would
arise from another delay, vows to stick to the schedule.
"We're doing this privatization under the worst possible
conditions," Economic Planning Secretary Moises Ikonicoff
acknowledges. "People mistrust the country, unions are
applying enormous pressure, and so are our foreign creditors.
This is the worst privatization in the world -- short of not
doing it at all."
   By beginning with Entel, Mr. Menem has picked a powerful
emblem of Argentine state enterprise -- and a symbol of its
woes. The telecommunications company has become the country's
second-largest concern after Yacimientos Petroliferos
Fiscales, with more than $1 billion in sales and 46,000
employees. Entel has also become a model of inefficiency, red
ink and red tape. It hasn't published a balance sheet since
1987, and estimates of its 1989 operating loss vary from
about $100 million to more than $250 million. "It's in a
state of collapse," says Maria Julia Alsogaray, the
government-appointed trustee who is running Entel until it is
taken private.
   Just how bad is the Argentine phone system? "Bad enough
that executives have cellular phones on their desk," says
Roberto Labarthe, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank in
Buenos Aires.
   Luis Cordoba, a Buenos Aires psychiatrist, waited 18 years
to get his phone installed and ended up paying $2,500 "to a
tailor who had a network" of friends at Entel who installed
the phone on the sly. "Otherwise, I'd probably still be
waiting," he says. Now, Mr. Cordoba's phone has been out of
order for almost a month, and he has little hope of someone
showing up to fix it soon.
   For a price, it is possible to get around this problem and
get a clandestine phone line or a "point to point" line -- a
connection to indispensable numbers, usually installed by
Entel employees on the side. "People come by and say, `Who do
you need to talk to?'" says Carlos Newbery, a businessman.
"And bang] A line goes out to four companies." These
clandestine lines are often stolen from someone else. "One
day, our fax machine went dead," Mr. Newbery recalls. "The
next day, we started getting someone else's faxes. What
happened is they'd sold our line to someone else and
reconnected us to someone else's line."
   Only about 10% of Argentina's population has phone
service. Though it has been estimated that Entel will need
about $5 billion in investment over the next 10 years, and
though the winner in the Entel privatization plan must agree
to increase the number of lines while progressively reducing
rates that are already lower than those in other nations for
local calls, the attraction is that so much needs to be done,
the opportunities for profits are big.
   Just by bringing in efficient accounting methods and
procurement procedures and combating fraud, "You have an
extraordinary windfall without doing anything," Mr. Ruiz, the
bank official, says.
