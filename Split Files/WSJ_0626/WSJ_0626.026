   Bulgarian author Tzvetan Todorov writing in the June 25
issue of the New Republic:

<TEXT>
   Several German intellectuals and politicians have had hard
words for their fellow citizens who flung themselves on the
West German shops as soon as they could. . . . These could
only be the words of people who have forgotten, or never
knew, the personal humiliation inflicted by the permanent
lack of the most elementary consumer goods: the humiliation
of silent and hostile lines, the humiliation inflicted on you
by salespeople who seem angry to see you standing there, the
humiliation of always having to buy what there is, not what
you need. The systematic penury of material goods strikes a
blow at the moral dignity of the individual.
