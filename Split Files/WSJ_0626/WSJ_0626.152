   LONDON -- The Norwegian cabinet decided Monday to drop oil
production controls for the second half of the year, Oil
Ministry Director General Marit Ingebretsen said.
   The measure, which takes effect July 1, eliminates the 5%
control the country's oil producers were forced to observe in
the first half of the year, Ms. Ingebretsen said.

   Ms. Ingebretsen said the cabinet decided to scrap the
limit for the remainder of the year because it "was having
very little effect" on reducing the amount of oil currently
overhanging the world market.
   Norway enacted the controls -- which slowed crude oil
production growth but not actual output -- in February 1987,
in support of efforts by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to stabilize the crude-oil market.
   From the onset of the voluntary controls, Norway said the
country's oil producers could produce no more than 92.5% of
their capacity. The limit was later pushed up to 95% of
capacity for the first half of 1990.
   But the measures didn't include a limit on the amount of
new production to come on stream; thus the country's output
increased as capacity grew with the development of new oil
fields.
   In a telephone interview from Oslo, Ms. Ingebretsen said
the cabinet would review the control system before the first
half of 1991 and would make changes if necessary.
   "We enacted the measures when OPEC production was low, but
since then OPEC has increased output by 50% while production
from outside the organization has stabilized," she said. "Now
that it seems that OPEC has trouble staying within its quota,
our measures are having very little effect on the market."
   In May, Norway produced 1.67 million barrels of crude oil
a day.
