   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is quietly pursuing a plan to
create a global radio network that would be run jointly by
the government and private industry.
   The network would use a $1 billion satellite system that
would begin broadcasts of music, information and advertising
around the year 2000. It would require a new generation of
radios that can receive satellite broadcasts.

   The proposal generally envisions private ownership of
satellites and radio stations in the U.S. market and
government ownership of satellites in foreign markets,
according to people who heard a briefing on the plan.
   The proposal is backed principally by the Commerce
Department, the U.S. Information Agency and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. But already the plan is
running into opposition from U.S. broadcasters, who fear that
the proposed system would gobble up scarce broadcast
frequencies and increase competition among radio stations. It
also may kick up a storm within the Bush administration,
where senior officials have fiercely opposed government
direction of new commercial technologies.
   Even so, the system has two big advantages. It would offer
broadcasters and advertisers a way to reach a national and
international market. And it would offer listeners
crystalline sound quality by using digital technology to
transmit signals.
   The Commerce Department's Office of Space Commerce has
invited a group of government and industry officials to a
breakfast today for their second, closed-door discussion of
satellite radio. Two satellite entrepreneurs -- Martin
Rothblatt, president of a consulting group here called Marcor
Inc., and Gary Noreen, president of Radio Satellite Corp.,
Pasadena, Calif.are scheduled to address the group.
   "Let's get started first in the U.S.," says Mr. Noreen,
who proposes a system that would broadcast 10 stations
nationally in 1993. "Then we can turn our system into a
world-wide system." A report of the federal effort first
appeared in Space Business News, an Arlington, Va.,
newsletter.
   At the first Commerce Department meeting, on April 17, H.
Don Messer, USIA's satellite broadcast program manager,
sketched his agency's plans for the system. According to a
memo passed around at the meeting, the system would include
as many as 100 radio stations that could broadcast anywhere
in the world with a sound quality comparable to compact
disks. Mr. Messer's memo called the plan "a fundamentally
different, new radio broadcasting service from satellites."
   For global reach, the USIA envisions four satellites in
orbit, at a total cost of $700 million. A one-satellite
system, costing $200 million, could cover the Americas,
Europe and Africa, the memo said. The USIA is pushing the
plan to increase its reach geographically, to cut its costs
by sharing the satellite system with commercial broadcasters
and to improve its quality, said participants in the Commerce
Department meetings. The Voice of America, for instance,
broadcasts on scratchy, shortwave frequencies and wants to
augment its service with a better-resolution system.
   The agency has enlisted NASA in support of its proposal.
The two agencies will spend $3 million over three years
studying the engineering requirements of a satellite system.
They also plan to seek broadcast frequencies for the system
at an international meeting in 1992 called the World
Administrative Radio Conference. Any communications system
that transmits abroad needs international approval for use of
foreign frequencies.
   The proposal faces formidable political and technical
obstacles. Most importantly, current radios can't receive
satellite signals, so the agencies must persuade
manufacturers to develop a new generation of receivers. It
also will require the Federal Communications Commission to
allocate a huge number of unused or currently used broadcast
frequencies, which U.S. broadcasters will surely oppose. The
National Association of Broadcasters, for instance, last week
tried to head off the satellite system by proposing a digital
transmission system using conventional, land-based radio
towers.
   The two satellite entrepreneurs so far have made proposals
to the FCC that closely mirror aspects of the federal
proposal, but that would provide service by 1994. The systems
would be privately owned.
   Mr. Rothblatt, the Marcor executive, asked the FCC to
approve a $330 million plan that he calls Satellite CD Radio
Inc. His system would use two satellites to provide 100
channels of compact-disk quality music in the U.S. starting
in 1994. In an attempt to blunt opposition from broadcasters,
Satellite CD reserves one-third of the channels for local
broadcasters. Listeners would use radio sets with antennas
that look like cellular-phone antennas to pick up the
satellite signals, he says.
   "NASA and Commerce being behind this concept gives people
more technical confidence that it will work," Mr. Rothblatt
says. The two agencies declined to comment on the system.
   Mr. Noreen proposes something more modest. He asked the
FCC to approve construction of a $1 million earth station in
Pasadena to transmit 10 channels of music, as well as paging
data and telephone calls to a satellite that the FCC has
already approved for launch in 1993. Mr. Noreen is a partner
in that satellite venture, called American Mobile Satellite
Corp.
   The California entrepreneur says his system at first
wouldn't offer compact-disk quality sound, but rather would
offer a package of services. He envisions a car radio that
could pick up FM-quality satellite radio stations and also
act as a pager and a mobile phone. He says the receiver could
be on sale by Christmas of 1993 and cost about $200 more than
top-of-the line conventional radios.
   The two entrepreneurs already are taking potshots at each
other. Mr. Noreen calls the Satellite CD proposal "silly" and
grandiose. Mr. Rothblatt counters that Mr. Noreen's idea is
too limited. "It's geared to truckers -- people who like
radio and a pager rolled into one," he says.
   For its part, the FCC has asked for comment on the
Satellite CD proposal. "It's getting a lot of discussion in
and out of the agency," says Ray Laforge, an FCC engineer who
is attending the Commerce Department meetings.
