   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. has budgeted $250 million in
fees for banks, Wall Street firms and other advisers in its
giant debt refinancing, suggesting that patching up leveraged
companies may be the financial community's next big
moneymaker.
   "It's kind of amazing that people can make money on this,"
said one commercial banker who has seen details of the new
RJR refinancing package and expects to participate. He
observed that RJR's refinancing will come just 18 months
after the food and tobacco company was taken private in a
leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. That
original 1989 buy-out generated more than $1 billion in fees.

   As reported, RJR Nabisco this summer plans to retire more
than $4 billion of high-yield junk bonds that could present a
financial crisis for RJR when their interest rates must be
reset next year. Those bonds are to be replaced with bank
debt, equity and new preferred stock. The $5.3 billion
refinancing package, which also includes the retirement of $1
billion in increasing rate notes, has been designed by KKR,
RJR's biggest shareholder.
   In general, Wall Street securities firms and commercial
banks have been scrambling this year to turn troubled-company
restructuring into a profit center, particularly because of
the sharp falloff in their once lucrative takeover business.
   Firms such as Rothschild Inc., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. all have expanded their
restructuring departments in recent months. In many cases,
they are working with companies that took on too much debt at
Wall Street's urging just a few years ago.
   Only KKR is missing out on the fee windfall this time; it
confirmed that it won't charge RJR for its work on the
refinancing. That's an unusual switch for KKR, which charged
some of the biggest fees on Wall Street throughout the 1980s,
culminating in a $75 million fee for putting the RJR buy-out
together.
   Lately, however, Wall Street fees have come under much
tougher public and Congressional scrutiny. A big KKR fee on
the refinancing transaction likely would have caused protests
from RJR bondholders and from legislators.
   So the biggest chunk of the $250 million in fees is likely
to go to commercial banks. People who have seen RJR's
proposed terms say that banks that lend $200 million or more
will collect fees equal to 3.5% to 4% of their loans. Banks
lending less than $200 million will collect fees equal to
2.75%.
   Such fees will be among the most lucrative ever offered to
commercial banks for a major leveraged-company loan. "It's
very attractive," said one Japanese banker. By comparison,
banks earned fees of just 1% in the 1986 buy-out of Beatrice
Cos., and about 3% on the original RJR buy-out.
   Total bank fees for the refinancing could reach $120
million or more, according to people familiar with RJR's
finances. Of that amount, as much as $80 million would
represent fees on the $2.25 billion in new money that RJR
wants to borrow from banks. Another $20 million is likely to
go for a "consent fee" that would allow RJR to borrow more
money under its existing loan agreements. And if RJR draws
down a further $1.1 billion in unused bank loans under an
existing revolving credit agreement, it could pay banks $20
million or more in additional fees.
   That still leaves as much as $130 million to be divided
among Wall Street securities firms, lawyers and other
advisers. It's understood that RJR hopes its fee budget is
overly large and it won't have to pay the full $250 million.
Historically, though, Wall Street fees have tended to
escalate beyond companies' initial projections.
   On Wall Street, RJR is being advised by two investment
banks, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. RJR also
has made extensive use of one of KKR's major law firms,
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. The company's eventual printing
bill for its bond-exchange offer is likely to be sizable,
too. Even proxy-solicitation firms hope to get in the act by
managing the paperwork associated with RJR's exchange offer.
   Bankers said they don't know how the fees would be
divided. Officials at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and
Simpson Thacher either didn't return phone calls or declined
comment. RJR and KKR also declined comment.
   As for the refinancing package itself, bankers said it
appears to be coming together quickly. Fuji Bank of Japan has
joined four U.S. banks, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chase
Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Citicorp,
as agents for the loan. Each has agreed to provide $350
million. Commitments on the bank loan are due by July 6, and
one banker estimated that the loan will be 50% to 100%
oversubscribed.
