   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress passed an Amtrak authorization
bill after removing the railroad anti-takeover provision that
drew a veto from President Bush.
   The bill, approved by voice votes in the House and Senate
and sent to the White House, caps federal subsidies for the
government-owned passenger railroad at $684 million in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and at $712 million the
following year.

   In vetoing an earlier version, Mr. Bush said he accepted
the spending figures but objected to a requirement that the
Interstate Commerce Commission review proposed acquisitions
of the 16 largest freight railroads by non-railroad
companies. The House voted to override the veto, but the
Senate narrowly failed to get the needed two-thirds majority
to override.
   "Because the president's concerns have been addressed . .
. the current version of the bill is acceptable to the
administration," the White House said.
   Rep. Thomas Luken (D., Ohio), chairman of the House
subcommittee on transportation, said the bill authorizes
enough money for Amtrak to replace and upgrade its passenger
cars. The actual appropriations, however, still must be
determined in a separate spending bill.
   In addition to Amtrak service, the bill would clear legal
impediments to starting commuter rail service between
northern Virginia and the District of Columbia.
