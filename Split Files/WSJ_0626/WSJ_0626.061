   Another federal official has warned against creating fears
over the safety of the U.S. food supply. One consequence of
driving the political system to enact extensive rules for
food production techniques, said Agriculture Assistant
Secretary Jack Parnell, is that it could raise the costs of
food in the supermarket, hitting the poor the hardest. But
food fear is largely a phenomenon among the upper middle
class, for whom costs to poorer consumers isn't a primary
concern.
