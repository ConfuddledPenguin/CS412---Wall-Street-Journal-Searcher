   Carter Holt Harvey Ltd., a New Zealand timber and building
materials concern, said it is buying a 52.7% stake in Elders
Resources NZFP Ltd. from Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia for
822.3 million New Zealand dollars (US$482.3 million), part of
a major restructuring of Elders IXL announced in March.
   The sale is conditioned on Elders Resources' selling all
except its forestry-based assets, which requires
authorization by Elders Resources directors and shareholders,
and approval by regulators in New Zealand and Australia,
where Elders Resources has oil, gas and coal interests.

   Carter Holt said the base price values the 411,159,696
shares it is buying at NZ$2 each. The final price is
adjustable to between NZ$700 million and NZ$900 million,
depending on the nonforestry assets' sale price. Once the
stake is acquired, a Cart Holt-Elders Resources merger
proposal will be put to holders of both companies.
   Elders IXL's restructuring includes plans to sell
resources and financial-services interests and spin off
agribusiness operations to concentrate on its core brewing
business.
