   PARIS -- The average unemployment rate for 16 of the
world's most industrialized countries rose to 6% of the work
force in April from 5.9% in March, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.
   The latest result represents only the second time the
OECD's standard unemployment rate has risen since a general
downward trend emerged in 1986 to bring the rate down 1.8
percentage points over three years. But the organization said
the rate has been steady at 6% since last December, except
for the March decline to 5.9%.

the U.S. and Finland, with marginal rises recorded by Canada,
Japan, Australia and Italy. The unemployment situation
improved somewhat in France and Sweden, however.
