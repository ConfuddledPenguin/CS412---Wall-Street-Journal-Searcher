   At the annual meeting, Community National shareholders
also approved a proposal to reduce authorized shares to 15
million from 50 million. The move will reduce the franchise
tax the bank pays in Delaware, where it is incorporated; the
tax is partly based on the number of shares a company is
authorized to issue. The cut in authorized shares doesn't
affect shares outstanding. Community National has around
three million shares outstanding.
   The bank reiterated that second-quarter earnings will drop
from the year-ago period but that it is hoping for an upturn
in the second half.
   In the first quarter, net income fell 73% to $211,000, or
seven cents a share, from $793,000, or 30 cents a share, a
year earlier. The bank's provision for possible losses on bad
loans grew to $1.3 million from $200,000. Assets climbed 32%
to $408 million.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Community National shares rose 25 cents to $6.75.
