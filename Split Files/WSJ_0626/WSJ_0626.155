   CHICAGO -- All but one of the eight publicly traded funds
originally sponsored by VMS Realty Partners said they would
continue to suspend distributions to shareholders despite
recouping about $108 million from the ailing syndicator this
year.
   At the first annual meetings since the unravelling of the
syndication giant began earlier this year, Leonard G. Levine,
president and chief executive officer of the funds, told
shareholders of three of the funds that no distributions
would be made because of pending class-action lawsuits
against the funds.

   One fund, VMS Strategic Land Trust, will pay a special
dividend of 21 cents a share and a regular quarterly dividend
of 10 cents a share, amounting to about $3.7 million in
distributions. Mr. Levine said the trust could be liquidated
"in the not-too-distant future."
   In addition to the litigation, Mr. Levine told
shareholders that the funds needed to conserve their cash
because VMS continued to withhold mortgage payments to the
funds and because existing loans may have foreclosure costs
or require payments to senior lenders. Mr. Levine
characterized the situation as "terribly unfortunate."
   In an interview, Mr. Levine, a former officer of VMS who
helped structure the funds, said that negotiations with VMS's
chief operating officer, Peter T. Cyrus, take place about
"friendly foreclosures" on a "daily basis." The funds haven't
yet taken possession of any VMS properties, Mr. Levine said,
although VMS is making payments on "less than five" of some
100 properties.
   Mr. Levine told shareholders that the discussions were
often "very heated. VMS is trying not to pay anything."
   The eight funds, including five real estate investment
trusts, or REITs, and three master limited partnerships, or
MLPs, raised $1.1 billion from about 100,000 investors in the
late 1980s to make loans exclusively to VMS and its
affiliates.
   VMS, which boasted as recently as last February that it
was one of the world's largest and most successful real
estate management and development firms, disclosed major cash
problems that month and the independent directors took
control of the eight funds.
   Xerox Corp., which owns a 25% stake in VMS, took a $400
million first-quarter charge to reflect its investment loss
in the partnership.
   Mr. Levine said the funds had seized control of secured
cash accounts and "significant amounts of interest reserves"
at VMS to protect against "the unfortunate event of any
bankruptcy by VMS." Mr. Levine, who hasn't any current
affiliation with VMS, said the partnership promoter was "in a
state of winding down."
   The funds also are in "daily contact" with Joel A. Stone,
VMS's president, over unsecured VMS assets, including
Rockresorts, the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Boca Raton,
Fla., and the Omni Park Central Hotel in New York City, Mr.
Levine said. In addition, the funds are attempting to gain
control over guarantee funds established by VMS to make
distribution payments to shareholders. Mr. Stone couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Mr. Levine said the funds would continue their recent
profitability "but not at the same level as the first
quarter" when VMS was still making interest payments for two
months. He said the funds would move from being "exclusively
mortgage REITs" to a "hybrid" of "mostly equity and some
mortgages" as they resolve their demands on VMS.
   In other business, shareholders overwhelmingly re-elected
the independent directors of the Land Trust, VMS Mortgage
Investment Fund and VMS Strategic Land Fund II. The two other
REITs meet Tuesday. The three MLPs don't hold annual
meetings.
