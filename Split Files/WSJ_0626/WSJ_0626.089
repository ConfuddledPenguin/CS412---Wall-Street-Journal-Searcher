   PYONGYANG, North Korea -- Forty years to the week after
the outbreak of the Korean War, the Cold War continues on the
Korean peninsula. More than a million and a half Korean
troops confront each other across the 130-mile "demilitarized
zone." Communication between the two sides is all but
nonexistent. In the north, Stalinism with Korean
characteristics has not only been established, but perfected
by Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. In the south, more than
40,000 American troops and an undisclosed number of nuclear
weapons remain today to deter North Korea from launching
another surprise attack.
   If East-West relations are markedly less tense today than
in the recent past, precisely the opposite is true in Korea.
In April, for example, it was reported that the Pentagon had
revised its estimate of warning time in the event of another
Korean war downward to only 24 hours.

   In spite of such unpromising fundamentals, the forced
division of Korea is becoming increasingly unsustainable.
   It would, of course, be unwise to draw too many parallels
between the German and Korean situations. Nonetheless,
Germany has already demonstrated just how suddenly a long
contest between rival states in a divided nation can come to
an end. In Korea too, the race between north and south is now
drawing to a close.
   There was a time -- 30 years ago -- when the command
planning system of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
seemed to be evincing better material results than the
Republic of Korea's mismanaged, aid-fed and inward-looking
economy. That, however, is ancient history. True, Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, is a clean city of tall buildings
and cheerful colors that, despite a somewhat surreal,
movie-set quality, compares favorably in a number of ways
with Moscow and Beijing. At the same time, however, no one
who has been to both cities could honestly say that living
standards in Pyongyang even approach those in Seoul, the
capital of South Korea. The contrast is reflected even in the
faces of children. In Pyongyang, the most common skin
irritation visible among schoolchildren is ringworm -- an
infection typically associated with poor hygiene or lack of
soap. In Seoul, the corresponding affliction is acne --
typically associated with a diet too rich in fats and oils.
   In the countryside, the disparities between the two
societies are even greater. The hillsides of North Korea have
a brownish hue. The vegetation and underbrush have been
stripped for firewood, forage perhaps even food. Even in the
poorest regions of rural South Korea, hillsides are generally
green; peasants no longer need to pillage the landscape for
their sustenance.
   North Korea's economy is animated by political enthusiasm;
South Korea's, by personal incentives. The difference shows,
and the gap can be expected to widen in the future.
   As one might expect of a society based upon and driven by
political fervor, North Korea, now in its fifth decade, is
approaching exhaustion. Uniformed military personnel are
everywhere to be seen, engaged not in traditional defense
activities, but rather in ordinary construction and factory
work. Such militarization, of course, can be read in many
ways, but one interpretation is that special, conscripted
units are now needed to do jobs previously entrusted to the
regular civilian workforce.
   North Korea has been built under, and around, a single
ruler. Whatever one may think of him, Kim Il Sung has been an
extraordinary force -- a force, moreover, that has been
consistently underestimated in the West. But this force is
now 78 years old. Once a powerful orator, he now slurs and
stumbles his way through pretaped television speeches.
"Spontaneous" demonstrations of support for the Great Leader
broadcast over North Korean TV today seem to lack their once
characteristic hysteria.
   Prospects for his son and heir-designate, Beloved Leader
Comrade Kim Jongil, are at best uncertain. Voluntary transfer
of supreme power is consistent neither with the communist
experience nor with the dynastic tradition of East Asia. The
longer the transfer of supreme power from the regime's
founding presence is deferred, the more fragile the inherited
polity is likely to be.
   In the diplomatic arena, the contest between the two
Koreas for international recognition and legitimacy was, for
a time, quite evenly matched. But by 1988, when Seoul served
as host for the Summer Olympic Games, South Korea had clearly
pulled ahead. With this month's meeting between Mikhail
Gorbachev and South Korea's President Roh Tae Woo, the
contest has moved to the end-game.
   For more than 40 years, North Korea has been able to count
on support from its two communist neighbors, China and the
Soviet Union. Now both China and the Soviet Union have
developed strong trade links with South Korea -- links they
dearly wish to make even stronger. With the recent
improvement in Sino-Soviet relations, moreover, North Korea's
utility to Moscow and Beijing has diminished substantially.
The Soviet Union reportedly continues to supply North Korea
with arms, and to transfer some technology. Yet for all
intents and purposes, the Gorbachev Politburo seems to have
written off North Korea several years ago. Though
symbolically important, the "surprise" meeting between Mr.
Gorbachev and Mr. Roh was not so much a breakthrough as a
public announcement of a pre-existing fact.
   Western commentators described the meeting as a deft
Soviet move. Examined more closely, Mr. Gorbachev's "coup"
has many markings characteristic of a diplomatic blunder.
Soviet officials, it now transpires, did not inform North
Korea during the many months of preparation for the meeting
that it was in the works. Soviet spokesmen went out of their
way to make insulting comments about North Korea to the media
before the meeting. Even by the most charitable reading, such
behavior was ill-advised. The Soviet Union's allure to South
Korea lies not in its commercial markets, but in its
potential influence over the north -- an influence Soviet
actions have been busily and deliberately dissipating. Mr.
Gorbachev may well have altered the "correlation of forces"
in Korea, albeit inadvertently. The over all fact of Soviet
decline, and the graceless first steps of the Soviet Union's
new Korea policy, would seem to leave the U.S. with greater
influence in the Korean peninsula as whole than it has
enjoyed in decades.
   How can the U.S. use this influence to encourage a free
and peaceful reunification of Korea? First and foremost, it
must retain its security commitment to Seoul. American power
has helped maintain the peace in the Korean peninsula for 37
years. It would be the utmost in folly to shun America's
allies in the south at this point, when prospects for
upheaval and instability in the north are rising actuarially.
   Second, the U.S. can take steps to lessen needless
misunderstandings -- as opposed to fundamental disagreements
-- with North Korea. Scholarly contact and increased travel
between the U.S. and the north are two possible avenues for
nurturing the "human element" that has always figured so
prominently in Korea's relations with the outside world.
   Third, the U.S. can encourage its friends in Seoul to
amend certain policies toward North Korea that are driven by
emotion, and are manifestly self-defeating. It can no longer
serve any good purpose, for example, to jam broadcasts from
the north. North Korean propaganda is utterly unlikely to
turn students in the south against their own government. A
policy based on strength and reason would be to declare South
Korea unilaterally open to broadcasts, mail and visits from
the north -- and to invite North Korea to reciprocate.
   Fourth, the U.S. must start to think about encouraging
South Korea to embrace fully the rule of law. Despite its
open and competitive mass elections, the South Korean
political system still lacks many essentials of the Western
liberal order. Impartiality before the law, for example,
cannot be taken for granted, and personalized, even
vindictive, exercise of official power frequently occurs.
Such qualities are troublesome and unpleasant today, but they
will become incalculably more costly if South Korea should be
in a position to set the basic terms of reunification in the
not-too-distant future. In living memory, the north has known
only harsh Japanese colonial rule and communist dictatorship.
Bitterness runs deep in Korea, and regional animosities
predate by centuries the surprise attack of 1950. Under the
best of circumstances, Korea will take a long time to heal.
Capricious, arbitrary or predatory abuse of authority will
only postpone that healing process.
   From 1945 to the present, American policy in Korea can be
read as a history of being taken unawares by events that were
largely predictable. (This is but one of many differences
between the Korean and the German situations.) The coming
reunification on the Korean peninsula is a predictable event.
The human cost -- both in Korea and beyond -- of the
transition might be mercifully reduced if American
policymakers began to think about it in advance.
