   WASHINGTON -- For Rep. William Gray, it's the
investigation that won't go away.
   Mr. Gray's name was linked a year ago to a
Philadelphia-based criminal inquiry -- unfairly, his attorney
says. But federal agents have continued to ask questions
about his finances. The probing appears to have intensified,
centering, in large part, on his ties to a Philadelphia
church where he is the unpaid senior pastor.

   An attorney for the Bright Hope Baptist Church says that
as far as he can tell the Federal Bureau of Investigation
wants to know whether Mr. Gray, the third-ranking House
Democrat, improperly benefited in any way from speaking fees
he assigned to the church as charitable contributions.
   "It doesn't take a rocket scientist" to see that federal
investigators want to "determine whether the honoraria went
to Bill's church and not to him personally," says Rotan Lee,
the church's attorney. Mr. Lee emphasizes that he doesn't
know of any instance in which speaking fees earmarked for the
church were kept by Mr. Gray or used for his benefit.
   It is unclear what possible law violations might be under
scrutiny. Lawmakers are subject to laws restricting how much
outside earned income, such as speaking fees, they may keep.
In addition, they must comply with guidelines for disclosing
their financial dealings.
   Last year, after word leaked that Mr. Gray had been
visited by FBI agents, the Justice Department publicly
declared he wasn't under investigation -- a statement that
contributed to his election as majority whip, one of the most
important leadership posts in Congress. In addition, Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh initiated a leak investigation
that led to the reassignment of two of his top aides.
   But when asked last week about the status of the Gray
inquiry, a Justice Department spokesman, Dan Eramian,
declined to repeat the earlier statement that Mr. Gray isn't
a target. "I have absolutely nothing to say," he said.
   Rep. Gray declined to be interviewed. Instead, he issued a
four-paragraph statement decrying the "cowardly individuals"
and "shadowy figures" in the Justice Department who, he
charged, were spoonfeeding "false charges" to the media.
   In the statement, Rep. Gray asserted: "Apparently, the
leakers feel they can restore the good name of the Department
of Justice by ruining mine." He added: "Enough is enough. I
will not spend another minute allowing these so-called
Justice Department `sources' to engage me in this type of
nonsense."
   As for the investigation itself, Mr. Gray's attorney, Abbe
Lowell, insists that "the focus is not Bill Gray" but a
Philadelphia accountant, Neil Godick, who once worked for Mr.
Gray's congressional office and who, according to Mr. Lowell,
handled his tax returns and public financial disclosure
forms. From 1981 to 1986, Mr. Gray's congressional office
paid Mr. Godick at least $46,111, according to House records.
   Mr. Godick has been under investigation in Philadelphia
where his accounting firm filed for bankruptcy-law protection
in 1987. A creditor in the bankruptcy-law case accused Mr.
Godick of embezzling $278,000. Mr. Godick's attorney, Marc
Durant, says Mr. Godick has been paying off the debt and
hasn't been charged with a crime.
   Mr. Durant also says the inquiry involving Rep. Gray's
name isn't directed at Mr. Godick at all. "Any suggestion
otherwise is simply unfounded and a diversionary tactic," he
says.
   Federal investigators continue to ask questions about Mr.
Gray and seek documents pertaining to his finances. In a
telephone interview June 12, Mr. Lee, the church's attorney,
said the FBI inquired about the church's "relationship to its
pastor," Mr. Gray.
   Mr. Lee said the FBI questioned two church officials,
Shirley Sharpe, an administrator at Bright Hope, and Lawrence
Wells, head of the board of trustees.
   House records show that Mrs. Sharpe served on Mr. Gray's
congressional payroll as a part-time employee in the 1980s
and has been paid at least $36,500 since 1982. Mrs. Sharpe
declined to comment. William Robinson, who serves on the
board of trustees, also has been on Rep. Gray's congressional
payroll. Mr. Robinson has been paid at least $131,000, mostly
for part-time work, since 1979, House records show. Mr.
Robinson couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Lee also said that FBI agents were given access to
financial records involving Mr. Gray and the church in the
latter part of last year and again early this year. Mr. Lee
said the records included information on speaking fees that
Mr. Gray assigned to the church as well as data on the 1985
sale of his Philadelphia house to Bright Hope.
   A lawyer in private practice in Philadelphia, who is
familiar with the church-FBI situation, gave a similar
account. He said the FBI had asked the church staff about Mr.
Gray's contributions to the church and about the sale of his
house.
   After providing The Wall Street Journal with his account,
Mr. Lee changed it. He said federal agents hadn't seen church
documents or interviewed church officials, at least "to my
knowledge." Mr. Lee said he had spoken with Mr. Gray's chief
of staff, Jon Plebani, but that he wasn't under any pressure
to alter his account and that his initial remarks were
misconstrued. Mr. Plebani says he didn't ask Mr. Lee to
change his account.
   The government's interest in Rep. Gray's sale of his house
apparently was sparked by a story in the Washington Post last
year. The newspaper said the church bought the house for
$125,000, and took out a $100,000 mortgage to pay for it in
1985. That same year, the Post account said, Mr. Gray began
donating some speaking fees to the church, a fact that
suggested he might have been paying the church's mortgage.
   Just how much money Mr. Gray donated to the church isn't
known. Mr. Lee says that the church has been "a major
beneficiary" of charity from Mr. Gray and that he asked the
trustees to make the information available to the Journal.
But the board decided against releasing the information, Mr.
Lee says. Rep. Gray won't provide the information either.
   Mr. Gray has been one of the most active speakers-for-pay
in Congress. In 1989, only one other lawmaker earned more in
speaking fees than Rep. Gray, who made $164,098.17. Under
House rules, members can keep only $26,850 in outside earned
income, or 30% of their congressional pay of $89,500. Mr.
Gray kept $25,000, according to his disclosure statement, and
donated the rest to charities. His office declined to
identify the charities, other than the church and Burke,
Va.-based Kids Inc., where Mr. Gray's wife, Andrea, works as
a part-time fund-raiser and events planner.
   Investigators have sought information on speaking fees
Rep. Gray has given to Kids -- some $16,200 since 1986, his
staff says. That's the equivalent of about one-fourth of the
$60,000 in salary that Kids paid Mrs. Gray from 1987 to 1989.
   This spring, a federal grand jury in Philadelphia issued
subpoenas on Washington lobbying groups that paid honoraria
to Rep. Gray. The subpoenas sought data on any payments to
Mr. Gray, his wife and to charities. Some subpeonas named
Kids and the Bright Hope church and sought data from 1984 to
the present. The subpoenas were disclosed in May by
Congressional Quarterly magazine.
   Kids was established in 1984 and has been supported by a
number of congressmen and senators. Kids, which tries to
fulfill the dreams of gravely ill children, says Mrs. Gray is
one of two paid employees.
