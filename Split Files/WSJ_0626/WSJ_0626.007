   On June 14, you published an editorial on the Milwaukee
Parental Choice Program, entitled "The Polly Williams
Backlash," about an "experimental plan to let 1,000
low-income Milwaukee children use vouchers to attend a
private school of their choice." In that editorial you
responded to my June 7 letter. I would like your readers to
know what my letter said.
   I commented on the failure in your June 6 editorial to
state the constitutional challenge properly. The challenge
made is that the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program violates
the Wisconsin Constitution because there are no standards
imposed upon the private schools. For example, a private,
nonsectarian school must meet only one of four criteria. One
of these is that at least 70% of the families of pupils in
the program meet parental-involvement criteria established by
the private school itself. In other words, the private
schools determine their own eligibility to receive public
funds.

   Your June 14 editorial corrected the record with respect
to the constitutional claims. However, you then wrote that
you called John E. Chubb for a response to the accountability
issue. According to the news report in your editorial, Mr.
Chubb laughed at this position, stating that the private
schools issue diplomas that are recognized by state
universities. The only thing laughable is Mr. Chubb's
uninformed response. None of the private schools in Milwaukee
that have requested to participate in the program provide
high-school diplomas. Most of the schools end their curricula
at eighth grade. Some end their program at first grade.
Obviously, elementary- and middle-school education have
virtually nothing to do with college-admission requirements.
   A principal assertion I made in my letter concerning your
position being at odds with the Chubb article was the fact
that Mr. Chubb suggests there are graduation requirements and
teacher-certification requirements. These requirements do not
appear in the Milwaukee Choice Program. In addition, I
pointed out that the Chubb article discusses at length the
methods to meet the needs of disabled children, children at
risk and children with learning disabilities. The Milwaukee
Choice Program did not make any provisions for such students.
   Your June 14 editorial accepts uncritically the claims
made by the Harambee Community School and the Urban Day
School that a high percentage of their students graduate from
high school and go on to college. Both these schools end
instruction at eighth grade.
   The most recent public data concerning Harambee show it
had 168 full-time students. Only nine were in the eighth
grade; 56 students were either in pre-kindergarten or
kindergarten; 40 students were in first and second grade; 30
in third and fourth grade; 24 in fifth and sixth grade; and
nine in seventh grade. It is inconceivable that anyone has
any reliable statistics to demonstrate that 98% of the 168
students go on to college. There is a substantial drop-off in
enrollment between pre-kindergarten/kindergarten and eighth
grade. If the claim of success is being made only with
respect to nine eighth-grade students, the statistic is
meaningless.
   The same phenomena can be seen with the Urban Day School.
Out of the 373 students reportedly enrolled in fall 1989,
only 18 were in the eighth grade; 202 were in
pre-kindergarten and kindergarten; 62 were in first and
second grade; 43 were in third and fourth grade; 29 were in
fifth and sixth grade; and 19 were in seventh grade. Again,
there is a significant drop-off in enrollment.
   The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program should be evaluated
as it is written. The private schools should be evaluated "as
is." By embracing the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, you
are endorsing the uncontrolled and unregulated giveaway of
public money and also endorsing discriminatory education
opportunities of handicapped children, children with learning
disabilities and children at risk.
