   CHICAGO -- The cost of bacon in that summertime favorite,
the BLT, is going up, thanks at least in part to the White
House.
   Pork prices in grocery stores have gone hog wild recently,
exceeding $2 a pound for the first time in one government
measure, in a development that has also triggered the closing
of several major slaughterhouses.

   Few anticipated this price surge last year when the
average hog was so cheap that farmers asked Uncle Sam for
help. It came in an unusual form: a donation of 12.4 million
pounds of U.S. pork bellies to food-strapped Poland. With the
gesture, the White House wanted to help prop up the new
government there while reducing U.S. stockpiles that had
swollen to their highest level in 18 years.
   Since then, the price of a hog has at times soared roughly
50% above year-earlier levels. The price of a pork belly --
which is sliced to make bacon -- fetches almost twice what it
did last year.
   Farmers are bemused. In Independence, Iowa, Dick Frye is
pocketing the best profits he has seen in more than a decade.
"It's really strange," says Mr. Frye, whose porcine profits
helped him buy his first new tractor in 16 years, "but it's
great."
   Off the farm, however, things are grim.
   Seven major slaughterhouses have closed so far this year
compared to the closing of one plant for all of 1989, the
Agriculture Department says. In most cases, the plants
couldn't afford to pay the stiff price for hogs. The plant
closings have laid off thousands of workers and are speeding
the concentration of market power into the hands of the top
slaughterhouses.
   Several companies are blaming high hog prices for eroding
their earnings. Bob Evans Farms Inc., a Columbus, Ohio,
restaurant chain, said earlier this month that its net income
for the year ended April 27 dropped 9.5% to $27.7 million on
sales of $454.3 million because of lower profit margins from
its sausage business.
   Pork processor Smithfield Foods Inc. of Smithfield, Va.,
said its net in the year ended April 29 fell 28% to $7.1
million from a year ago despite a non-recurring net gain of
$1.1 million in the fourth quarter. Aaron D. Trub, Smithfield
secretary and treasurer, said a dip in hog prices in recent
weeks from their record high level is easing pressure on the
company.
   As for consumers, they'll feel the impact of high hog
prices at the supermarket and restaurant counter for months
to come. According to the Agriculture Department, the price
charged by supermarkets for a composite of fresh pork cuts
hit $2.06 a pound in May, up about a nickel from April and up
16% from May 1989.
   In an Indiana supermarket, the price of a pound of bologna
has jumped 40 cents, to $3.29, from a year ago. Elsewhere,
the retail price of sausage has climbed 25% in the past 12
months to a record.
   The National Pork Producers Council, which pushed the
White House to send pork aid to Poland, credits its lobbying
effort with improving the lot of its hog farming members.
   But Agriculture Department officials insist that the
shipment of pork bellies to Poland was too small to have
driven up prices significantly in the U.S.
   Economists didn't know it at the time, but the government
mobilized last fall to combat low prices just as those prices
were prompting farmers to significantly trim the number of
pigs being born. Because fewer pigs were born, the supply of
hogs fat enough for slaughter during the second quarter
probably fell 6% from the year-earlier quarter, analysts
said.
   Complicating matters, the flow of Canadian hogs to U.S.
meatpackers has thinned just as the Japanese have increased
their purchases of U.S. pork.
   Relief in the form of more hogs probably isn't coming
anytime soon. Analysts are divided over whether a quarterly
department survey of hog farmers slated for release Friday
will show an increase in the number of pigs. To fatten a pig
for slaughter takes about six months.
   The major slaughterhouse companies that have stopped at
least some operations so far this year handled, combined,
about 10% of the hogs slaughtered last year. Several smaller
plants have also closed.
   Because of the tight supply of hogs, meatpackers are
bidding up prices to keep their plants operating. They are
finding only about 290,000 hogs each weekday, which means
they are operating at three-fourths of capacity, says Thomas
Morgan, a livestock analyst and president of Sterling
Research Corp.
   In the high-volume, low-margin business of slaughtering
animals, such a low operating rate means that some
meatpackers are losing between $2 and $4 on every hog killed.
   "Everybody is losing money," says Mel Davis, vice
president of raw materials at the meatpacking unit of
Farmland Industries Inc., a Kansas City, Mo.-based
cooperative. "The question is whether you have the money to
weather the storm."
   So far, the situation hasn't slowed the plans of two big
beef slaughtering companies to expand in the hog-killing
business.
   Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra Inc. has completed a renovation
project at its three hog slaughtering plants that will allow
it to double its combined capacity to 12 million hogs a year.
   Last month, IBP Inc. opened the world's largest hog
slaughter plant in Waterloo, Iowa. Construction on the $40
million plant, which has the capacity to kill 15,000 hogs a
day, began two years ago.
   Analysts aren't clear on where hog prices, and thus retail
pork prices, will go this summer. Hog prices have eased about
8% so far this month, and some supermarkets have been cutting
their purchases of pork amid worries that the high retail
price is beginning to chill consumer demand. However, hog
prices usually hit their highest levels in mid-summer.
