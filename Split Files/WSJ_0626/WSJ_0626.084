   There is some comfort to the news that China has allowed
the flight into exile of two of its leading dissidents,
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian. Both have
been brave and patriotic advocates of democracy in China.
When the Chinese regime trampled the Tiananmen uprising last
June, Mr. Fang and his wife were forced to take refuge in the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where they have lived the past year
under siege. It's likely they'll find life easier in England,
where they reportedly have been granted asylum.
   This silver lining hardly seems reason for the U.S. to
have hailed Mr. Fang's departure as "a humanitarian action"
by China's Communist regime. His release takes place under a
thundercloud of repression that continues to cast its shadow
across the 1.1 billion people of China.

   Why must Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian flee China at all?
Their only "crime" was that their calls for democracy drew a
huge following among China's people. Such bravery remains a
counterrevolutionary crime in China. Indeed, the special
exemption from China's "laws" just granted to the Fangs helps
to underline the arbitrary nature of government in China,
where there is no law other than what suits the Communist
Party's convenience.
   China's regime congratulated itself yesterday via the
official state newswire, Xinhua, for giving "lenient
treatment" to Mr. Fang and his wife. There is no leniency,
however, for champions of Chinese democracy who are less
famous in the West. One of Mr. Fang's precursors, Wei
Jingsheng, remains in prison, serving the 15-year sentence
imposed in 1979 after he published his eloquent essay, "The
Fifth Modernization -- Democracy." Many who took part in last
year's protests also remain in prison, such as student
leaders Wang Dan, if he is still alive, and Liu Xiaobo.
   China's official explanation for Mr. Fang's release
included a reference to Mr. Fang having been allowed to go
abroad for "medical treatment." It's too early to confirm
this explanation. But we do know that what's truly ailing in
China is the centrally planned economy. The Party has chosen
to sacrifice economic growth in favor of tighter state
control over people's daily lives. It hopes to alleviate some
of the pain with foreign money. The decision to let Mr. Fang
leave for "medical treatment" seems well-timed to influence
the imminent annual meeting of the world's seven leading
industrial nations whose agenda will include government loans
to China.
   If the G-7 ministers or President Bush want to create
genuine standards for reform in China, they will have to look
beyond the release of political hostages such as Fang Lizhi.
Real political reform would mean that people such as Messrs.
Fang, Wei, Wang and Liu could live freely in China and
present their democratic arguments to the Chinese people. It
would mean that dissidents could form political parties to
compete with the Communists without fear of being jailed or
shot.
   The sad truth is that even if China were to expel every
dissident the West has ever heard of, such actions would not
necessarily reflect a basic change in the country's
totalitarian system. Mr. Fang's fate this past year became
one of the symbols of repression in China. Freeing only the
symbol tells us mainly that China has so stifled dissent at
home that it can now devote some energy to buffing its public
relations abroad.
