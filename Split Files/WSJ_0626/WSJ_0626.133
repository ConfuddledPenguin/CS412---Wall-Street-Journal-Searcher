   THE SUPREME COURT RULED on notification for abortion and
the right to die.
   The justices, providing legislators another opening to
curtail abortion rights, ruled that states can require most
minors to notify at least one parent before obtaining an
abortion. However, the high court said mandating notification
of both parents may interfere with the constitutional right
to abortion. Separately, the court ruled 5-4 that states may
require clear proof that a patient in a vegetative state
wishes to die before allowing food and water tubes to be
disconnected.

   By emphasizing the need for clear evidence of a patient's
wishes, the ruling is likely to encourage greater use of
so-called living wills by individuals.

   MANDELA URGED Bush to support efforts to end apartheid in
South Africa.
   The black nationalist leader, who met for three hours with
the president at the White House, defended the use of
violence to free Pretoria from white-minority rule, but said
force wouldn't be used as long as the South African
government negotiates in good faith with the black majority.
Bush assured Mandela the U.S. wasn't about to lift sanctions
against South Africa but said all sides in the anti-apartheid
struggle should renounce violence and repression.
   Mandela asked the U.S. to provide financial support to the
African National Congress, but the administration later said
it had rejected the request.

   CHINA ALLOWED dissident Fang to leave, ending his
U.S.-backed refuge.
   Chinese officials permitted Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian, to leave Beijing for Britain on a U.S. military
plane. Fang, an astrophysicist and human-rights advocate, and
his wife took sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy after last June's
crackdown on a prodemocracy movement. China's official news
agency said the pair were given "lenient treatment" so that
they could receive medical care abroad. Fang is said to have
a heart ailment.
   The U.S. declared, "This humanitarian action is a
farsighted, significant step that will improve the atmosphere
for progress in our bilateral relations."

estimated half million people have been made homeless.
