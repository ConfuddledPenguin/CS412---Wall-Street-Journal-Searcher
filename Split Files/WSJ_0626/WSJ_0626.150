   Maine Savings Bank, a unit of One Bancorp, said it signed
agreements in principle for the sale of its Bath and Camden
banking offices to Casco Northern Bank, a unit of Bank of
Boston Corp.
   Maine Savings, based in Portland, also agreed in principle

   Terms weren't disclosed and all sales require regulatory
approval. The transactions are expected to be completed
before year's end, Maine Savings said, and would reduce the
bank's assets by $180 million to about $1.5 billion.
   Maine Savings withdrew plans to sell five other offices
offered in January that didn't sell, Bangor Mall, Bangor Main
Street, Orono, Old Town and Waterville.
