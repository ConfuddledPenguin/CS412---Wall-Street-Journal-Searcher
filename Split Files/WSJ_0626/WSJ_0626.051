   SAXONBURG, Pa. -- II-VI Inc. said it expects
fourth-quarter revenue and bookings to be close to last
year's levels because of shortfalls in military and domestic
commercial orders.
   In the year-ago fourth quarter, II-VI reported revenue of
$3.6 million, bookings of $3.4 million and net income of
$388,000.
