   DUBLIN -- European Community leaders agreed on a timetable
for writing separate treaties on political union and economic
and monetary integration, but discussions here made it clear
the drafting process could be a tug-of-war.
   At the first day of a two-day summit, the 12 EC leaders
set the opening of the political union conference for Dec. 14
in Rome, followed the next day by the opening of the economic
and monetary union conference. The two conferences will
decide on amendments to the EC's founding Treaty of Rome,
giving EC institutions vast new powers.

   But the leaders made little progress reconciling
conflicting visions over exactly where the treaty amendments
should lead. French President Francois Mitterrand said he
would ultimately like to see the EC states bound together in
some kind of federation. But other leaders want a much looser
arrangement.
   The leaders adopted a broad text that leaves almost all
options open, and detailed discussions will come up only once
the conference gets under way.
   On the complex question of integrating EC monetary
policies and creating a single currency, there is even more
disagreement. The leaders made little progress deciding how
long it should take before they cede national control of
economic and monetary policy.
