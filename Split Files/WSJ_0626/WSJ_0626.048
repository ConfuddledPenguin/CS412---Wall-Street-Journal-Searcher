   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- Unusually tight security, even for a
high-tech company with military contracts, is your first clue
that "anything goes" isn't the motto at Motorola Inc.'s
headquarters in this Chicago suburb. And its employees soon
will have more than their briefcases checked.
   Motorola last month said it would become the biggest
corporation in America to screen employees for traces of
illegal drugs, beginning Jan. 1. Other Fortune 500 firms may
follow. Texas Instruments Inc., a year ahead in its testing
program, is the only other sizable company with a universal
urine-sample requirement.

   The programs are similar. They start first with top
management and then on a random, unscheduled basis test the
entire U.S. payroll over a few years. Those who refuse face
dismissal. Those who test positive are referred to a company
rehabilitation program and fired if they don't pass follow-up
inspections.
   Both companies emphasize that the tests complement
"education and awareness" programs aimed at grooming more
productive workers. Motorola has had one since 1979. Although
surveys suggest drug use is declining in America, the company
says the additional step is called for.
   "We have over the last several years experienced problems
with the workplace, some of it related to concern about
impairment, concern about theft, concern about gang activity,
which continues to go on," says Gary Howard, the
employee-relations director overseeing the program.
   Motorola has been testing for drugs before hiring since
1987. Word is out not to apply after toking up, however, so
now less than 2% fail. "It's probably more of an intelligence
test today than a drug test," says Mr. Howard. Likewise,
"for-cause" testing for ongoing employees is "virtually not
used," he says. Companies find supervisors unable to spot
sure signs of drug use or unwilling to risk mistakenly
singling out workers.
   "The question became, if those aren't working, should we
do more?" says Mr. Howard. In extensive small-group sessions,
he relates, 80% of surveyed Motorola workers wanted universal
testing. (Chuck Nielson, personnel vice president at Texas
Instruments, reports a similar consensus among its
employees.)
   Mr. Howard doesn't cite a specific safety incident
traceable to drugs but says one man from a wafer-fabrication
facility for semiconductor chips approached him after a focus
group to say that 25% to 30% of his co-workers would test
positive that day. "Those areas are highly influenced by
chemicals," says Mr. Howard. "Impairment in an area like that
can be a big problem."
   Why not test for dexterity and acuity, then, instead of
evidence of past indulgence? Even though devices to do that
are beginning to be sold, Mr. Howard says that wasn't
considered, "because there's nothing on the market today that
we're aware of that would do an effective job."
   Besides, he acknowledges, in some cases a drug user
arguably isn't impaired. "We're not particularly as concerned
about impairment, although we're concerned about it, as we
are about having a work force that doesn't use drugs. The
argument comes up, what business is it of Motorola if an
employee uses marijuana on the weekend. . . . Our stated
objective . . . {is} to become the finest company in the
world. You can't be the finest company in the world if you
don't have the best people in the world, what we refer to as
the `best in class' in Motorola. Best-in-class people to us
don't use drugs."
   They don't abuse alcohol, either, he adds. Relative
acceptance of drinking vs. illegal drugs was questioned by
employees, and Mr. Howard says the company is looking into
better technology for conducting for-cause tests of
insobriety, whose symptoms are thought easier to spot.
   Mr. Howard rejects the notion that the policy will trip up
some "casual users" of recreational drugs who pose no
problem. He argues thus: "A casual user by definition is
somebody who can quit anytime they want to. If somebody
continues to use marijuana in the face of a policy that says,
if it's in your system you jeopardize your employment status,
they're not a casual user anymore. By that definition, they
have a problem."
   Although it wants employees with such a problem to enroll
voluntarily in its treatment program, Motorola expects to
find at least 3,000 of its 60,000 U.S. labor force out of
compliance. (Texas Instruments, with 52,000 workers, won't
release its results thus far.) The effort is to cost $1.5
million the first year and $1 million annually thereafter,
Mr. Howard estimates. That doesn't include the tab for
in-house "rehab," which is running $4,000 to $10,000 for each
of the 100 to 125 self-referrals a month under the existing
program.
   By ridding itself of druggies, the $10 billion corporation
"conservatively" hopes to save $190 million a year. That
figure stems from economywide calculations of lost
productivity and absenteeism that some have charged are
hyped.
   Although recent anti-drug guidelines from the U.S.
Departments of Defense and Transportation give impetus to the
private sector, they emphasize the testing of workers in
sensitive positions, such as those directly bearing on public
safety. Motorola, as well as Texas Instruments, chose a more
expansive approach after employees rejected the idea of
selectivity. The ethos of "good for one, good for all,
including the boss" appears widespread.
   Both Motorola and Texas Instruments are non-union. Mr.
Howard, who previously did personnel work at Baxter
International and Weyerhaeuser, says this makes it easier to
implement testing. Unions have fought it.
   Like Texas Instruments, Motorola won't be testing in
states that bar employers from doing so. The biggest of these
is California, as a result of a state Supreme Court
interpretation last month of the privacy clause in the state
constitution. With its major outlying facilities in Arizona,
Florida and Texas, Motorola has a mostly free hand.
   Mr. Howard says the testing isn't "an invasion into
people's private lives. We have a serious problem in the
United States that is affecting you and me and everybody else
that depends on companies like this to keep our economy
strong. We in industry have been in a raging battle on a
multinational basis with very tough competitors . . . at a
time when we are not getting quality product out of the
school systems." Motorola sees the drug campaign as one piece
of its extraordinary effort at remediation of the labor pool.
   As its watchful eyes suggest, the sprawling Motorola
campus here can be deceiving. The outside world's ills
intrude. A private entity rightfully has leeway to deal with
personnel matters, and to the degree that drug use is a proxy
for gang activity or dereliction, it shouldn't be ignored. In
undertaking what Mr. Howard calls as "far-reaching" a mission
as any in his management experience, however, business must
beware being diverted to faddish crusades. The marketplace,
most of all in electronics, is a race to achieve. Social
work, by contrast, has no end.
