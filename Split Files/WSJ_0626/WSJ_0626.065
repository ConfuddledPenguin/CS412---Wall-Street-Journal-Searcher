   MAYNARD, Minn. -- At the Lutheran Church here, some
families refuse to worship in the same pew. Elderly farm
women no longer get together once a week for coffee. Boyhood
friends shun each other.
   Resentments are eroding even the most enduring rite of
rural life, the wave hello. Farmers sometimes pass on
Chippewa County 17 without even a nod of acknowledgement.

   What caused this rupture? Sugar.
   Residents of this heartland hamlet (population 428) are
embroiled in a modern-day range war, this one pitting the
"beeters" -- the sugar beet growers -- against their
grain-farming neighbors. Many farmers fume that the rich
beeters are getting richer at their expense -- thanks to
preferential treatment by the federal government.
   Across a broad swath of southern Minnesota and elsewhere,
beeters, flush with sugar profits, are outbidding other
farmers whenever land is rented or a farm is sold. They are
driving up land prices and rents, and crowding less fortunate
farmers off the land. "We've lost a whole generation of young
farmers," asserts Owen Gustafson, a Maynard grain grower and
a leader of Fair Farm Policy, a group protesting "inequities"
of sugar subsidies.
   The protests extend to international trade negotiations
and Congress, where the sugar program is under sharp attack
as lawmakers debate the 1990 farm bill. Arguably, it's the
sweetest deal in American agriculture: The government props
up domestic sugar prices by curtailing imports of lower-cost
sugar. Producers are guaranteed a "market stabilization
price" of 22 cents a pound, about nine cents higher than the
current world market price.
   The result: Although some other crops are also subsidized,
sugar beets often bring growers four times more per acre than
wheat and corn. Large beeters here reap $100,000 to $200,000
each in annual sugar benefits. That's not money from the
government, but from consumers in the form of higher prices.
Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana claims this "hidden
tax" costs consumers $2.4 billion a year -- although sugar
growers contend the figure is far-fetched.
   "That's super-welfare -- that isn't a safety net," says
Thomas Hammer, chief lobbyist for major sweetener users,
which are allied with Fair Farm Policy in seeking cutbacks in
sugar price supports.
   Counters Irvin Zitterkopf, president of Southern Minnesota
Beet Sugar Cooperative: "We aren't making as much as some of
the people using our products, like candy makers and cereal
people."
   For the farmers in this area, the debate taking place in
Washington couldn't hit closer to home. "What we're trying to
do is save our hides," says 51-year-old David Hovda, a
Renville County cattle feeder. "They {the beeters} have
really been endowed by the government. . . . They're going to
drive us all out."
   In Maynard and nearby Clara City and other small towns,
widespread fear for the future, edged by envy of wealthy
neighbors, is turning farmer against farmer, family against
family -- even dividing families.
   Marvin Freiborg, a member of a large family of beet
growers who himself worked with hogs, assailed the sugar
program two months ago in a letter to the editor of the Clara
City Herald. "I've kept quiet longer than I should have," he
wrote. "I'm tired of watching the majority of beet growers
outbid neighbors on land, expand their operations year after
year, drive nice pickups, buy new equipment. . . ."
   "My mom was just disgusted with me," says Mr. Freiborg,
who had to give up his land last fall when his landlord
raised the rent. "But I told the truth about what's
happening. I had an awful lot of people call me, thanking me.
They're just too timid to speak out."
   The range war has been building for several years. It
broke out into the open here when Mr. Gustafson, 39 years
old, went to Washington early last year to protest the sugar
program. He and his brother, Philip, have lost three pieces
of rented land totaling 488 acres to higher-bidding beeters
since 1985.
   Driving home one night, Mr. Gustafson passes a gently
swelling field, 160 acres of soft black earth under a canopy
of stars. He and his brother had rented it for $63 an acre
per year. It was sold last year, and the new owner rented it
to a big beet grower from the town of Sacred Heart for more
than $100 an acre. "There's no way we can pay that," he says.
What's more, the Gustafsons aren't members of the local
cooperative, so they can't profitably switch to growing sugar
beets.
   Accompanying Mr. Gustafson to Washington was an equally
feisty neighbor, Ronald Carpenter, 43, who says that when he
showed up at a land-rent auction here at LaRae's Cafe, alone
among 20 beeters, "They laughed at me. They knew I couldn't
afford the cash rent. I bid just to run up the price."
   Soon after the men returned from Washington, vandals broke
into Mr. Carpenter's machine shed while he and his family
slept. They dumped sugar into the gas tank of a tractor and
spray-painted farm equipment with graffiti like this, still
emblazoned on the side of his old pickup: "We Love Sugar."
   On Maynard's main street, business at the Hair Affair, the
beauty salon run by Mr. Carpenter's wife, Mary Ann, has
fallen 50% from last year because of a boycott by some wives
and daughters of beeters.
   Her mother-in-law's coffee klatch has broken up. "She used
to have coffee once a week with neighbor ladies," says Mrs.
Carpenter. "They had been friends for 40 years. They just
stopped calling."
   The dispute is two-sided. "One farmer purposely sprayed
herbicide so that the wind would drift it into the end rows
of a beet field and kill the beets," says the Rev. Martin
Scott Lucin, co-pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Clara
City.
   Nobody is more troubled about the schism than the
small-town ministers, who have been trying to help the
antagonists better understand each other. In a sermon last
year, the Rev. Ronald Duty, pastor of the Maynard Lutheran
Church, admonished his parishioners: "When we are jealous of
another's prosperity or greedy for their land, instead of
helping them to preserve their economic livelihoods . . . we
do damage to the human community."
   But for now, neither side is in the mood for
reconciliation. Mr. Lucin recounts a farmhouse visit last
year to a man dying of cancer: "He looked out the window and
he vowed, `The sugar beet guys aren't coming over here even
after I'm gone.'"
   Wayne Schwitters, a Clara City beet grower, telling of a
lost friendship with a local farmer, chokes up and looks
away: "Him and I can't talk in church."
   The rancor saddens Mr. Schwitters, one of the biggest beet
growers in an area homesteaded a century ago by immigrant
sodbusters, mostly from Scandinavia and Germany. "I feel
sorry for those people raising corn and soybeans," says the
48-year-old farmer. "I think in reality corn and beans are
way too cheap, and they are having a tough time."
   Sugar also is making things tense in the Red River Valley
along the Minnesota-North Dakota border. "Wheat farmers are
starting to hate sugar beet growers," says Jacob Bakke, an
elevator manager in Prosper, N.D. "It's unfair that they are
just breaking even and the beet growers are making big
bucks."
   And in southern Louisiana, the expansion of sugar-cane
planters is raising tempers in Cajun country. "These guys net
more than I can gross per acre," complains Bill Burley, a
soybean grower in Youngsville, La.
   Economic dislocations from the sugar program extend far
beyond the Farm Belt. To guarantee U.S. sugar cane and beet
growers the market-stabilization price, the government
slashed imports of raw sugar to 1.25 million tons last year
from four million a decade ago. Critics of the sugar program
say this has deprived numerous sugar-producing nations in the
Caribbean, Latin America and Far East of export earnings,
harmed their economies and caused political instability,
while increasing Third World demand for U.S. foreign aid.
   At home, the sugar program has helped make possible the
spectacular rise of the high-fructose corn syrup industry --
to the point that Americans now consume more corn sweetener
than refined sugar. The syrup industry itself is not covered
by the U.S. program. But by pegging their prices just below
the sugar support price, corn-sweetener producers captured
not only market share but huge profits.
   Sugar producers contend that the program protects U.S.
consumers from wild swings in world sugar prices while
shielding the producers from the sugar-dumping practices of
exporters, particularly the European Community, which heavily
subsidizes production.
   Minnesota and North Dakota beet growers say they wouldn't
mind fending for themselves in a free market, but only if all
sugar producers were put on equal competitive footing around
the world.
   The sugar program is under broad attack. At the urging of
Australia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has
decreed U.S. sugar-import quotas illegal. The Bush
administration appears ready to phase out the sugar program
and other forms of protectionism in its quest for a
breakthrough GATT agreement to end trade-distorting farm
subsidies.
   In Congress, strong bipartisan support is building for an
overhaul of the sugar program, beginning with a 10% cut in
sugar price supports.
   Opposing change is Big Sugar's lobby and its phalanx of
political-action committees, long fabled on Capitol Hill for
their generosity. From 1983 through mid-1989, sugar and
corn-sweetener lobbyists supported their pitches to members
of Congress with $3.3 million in campaign contributions,
according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission
records by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
Washington-based consumer group.
   That's a lot of money from about 10,000 beet growers in
the Midwest and the West; 1,000 cane producers, dominated by
a few big sugar planters and corporations in Florida,
Louisiana and Hawaii; plus a handful of sugar processors and
corn refiners. But they can afford it.
   Two of the biggest beneficiaries of the sugar program are
the U.S. Sugar Corp. and the Cuban-born Fanjul family of Palm
Beach, Fla., led by Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, who contributed
$100,000 toward Republican campaigns in 1988 alone, and his
brother Alfonso, who is similarly generous toward Democratic
Party endeavors. Between them, U.S. Sugar, based in the sugar
mill town of Clewiston, Fla., and the Fanjul corporate empire
control more than 60% of Florida's cane acreage and produce
more than 25% of the nation's cane sugar. Together they
collected what the sweetener-users group calls a "windfall"
of $180 million in sugar benefits last year.
   Here in southern Minnesota, beet growers such as Mr.
Schwitters say that other farmers could be growing beets if
they hadn't passed up chances to buy shares in the Southern
Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative in 1974, when it was
organized, and four years later, when it was rescued from
ruin by a government-guaranteed $11.5 million bailout.
   To grow sugar beets, farmers must join the cooperative,
which is the only processor in the area. But for most
farmers, the cost of joining -- currently at $900 per share
-- is prohibitive, and the number of shares available is
limited. (Typically, one share entitles a farmer to plant one
acre of beets.) Many of the transactions occur between
members of beet-growing families. With the future of the
sugar program in doubt, other farmers would have trouble
getting financing for a new co-op.
   Mr. Schwitters's rewards for taking the initial risk? A
diamond-studded stickpin in his tie. A 3,800-acre farming
operation, including 1,700 acres of beets. Seven hired hands
and seven families of migrant farm workers. A big house with
two-story cathedral ceilings and a veranda where, his wife
Jan says, "it's fun to sit and see the crops coming up and
the migrants working out there."
   Similarly rewarded are 330 other co-op shareholders. Last
year, they reaped an estimated $35 million in sugar
price-support benefits.
   Wheat, corn and some other crops are subsidized, but they
aren't protected by federal import controls as sugar is. A
Fair Farm Policy study of Minnesota farm data calculates that
the beet growers made an average profit of $206.40 an acre
from 1984 through 1988 -- about eight times what corn and
soybeans brought in at $25.53 and $25.94, respectively.
   The beet growers say that profit figure is greatly
exaggerated, although Mr. Schwitters concedes that beeters
earn more per acre than other farmers. "By golly, if I
didn't, I'd quit," he says. "It's a lot more work. It's a
specialized crop."
   The beet growers also maintain that local land prices and
rents haven't gone up nearly as much as the opposition says.
"Yes, there are rents in excess of $100" an acre, says
William Rudeen, a beet grower near Bird Island, Minn., and
current cooperative chairman. "But we're too small to have
the impact they say we have."
   Their neighbors also are irritated that the beeters, in
addition to sugar benefits, also collect wheat and feed-grain
subsidies for the part of their land devoted to those crops.
   But while the government limits subsidized grain acreage
each year to try to prevent surpluses, beeters can plant as
many beets as the cooperative's plant in Renville can
process. The result: Sheltered from foreign competition to a
great extent, they have expanded their beet acreage over 50%
since the cooperative started.
   The disparity deepens the local rifts, and merchants are
under pressure to take sides. "It's a tough fence to sit,"
acknowledges one farmer, Rolan Ammermann. His father-in-law,
a Clara City insurance agent, was aghast to hear from a beet
grower that Mr. Ammermann was baling oat straw for the
beeters' arch-foe, Ron Carpenter. Alarmed about appearances,
his father-in-law called him up. "It's got real tense for a
while," says Mr. Ammermann. "I just told him it's a business
deal."
   Also caught in the middle are landlords, including retired
farmers and widows. One young farmer, Randy Berends, has been
all but dispossessed because he can't afford to rent his
retiring father's 320 acres at $105 an acre. All he figures
he can afford is $70.
   "You can't blame the landlords for taking top dollar," he
says. "It would have been crazy for Dad to rent to me."
