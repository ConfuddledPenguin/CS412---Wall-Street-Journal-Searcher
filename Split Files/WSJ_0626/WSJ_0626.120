   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- MGM Grand Air wants to ease one
of the business traveler's greatest burdens: coach-class
travel.
   The small transcontinental luxury airline said it will
begin offering Aug. 16 a new, upgraded service for standard
coach-class fare. For the standard unrestricted Los
Angeles-New York coach fare of $623 one way, MGM Grand Air
will offer such frills as roomy leather seats, telephones,
video monitors and gourmet meals.

   The airline, a unit of MGM Grand Inc., has offered a
first-class service, at a current unrestricted fare of $1,017
one way, since September 1987.
   The airline's newly reconfigured DC8 Super 62 aircraft
will seat 79, with 39 passengers in first class and 40 in
coach. Those planes will replace MGM Grand's 727-100s and
will nearly double its capacity. The bigger planes prompted
MGM's decision to offer the new service, rather than trying
to fill all seats with first-class passengers.
   The cheaper fare raises questions as to whether MGM
Grand's current clientele will try to save a few bucks by
moving to the back of the plane. Charles Demoney, the
airline's president and chief executive officer, said the
company believes those customers will still want first-class
service.
   Last year, the airline reported a load factor of 73.9%,
and revenue of $30.2 million.
