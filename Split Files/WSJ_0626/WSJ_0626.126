   Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd., a London unit of
Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., said a
step-out, or appraisal, well in the Saltire field in the
North Sea indicates the field's estimated recoverable oil
reserves are 30% greater than formerly believed, or about 130
million barrels.
   Previously, the field's recoverable reserves of
high-quality oil were estimated at 100 million barrels.

   Occidental said the appraisal well had flows at stabilized
daily rates of 9,635 barrels of oil and 13 million cubic feet
of gas.
   The Occidental unit said the test-well results also
indicate that the Saltire field, about 120 miles northeast of
Aberdeen, Scotland, is larger than previously believed. As a
result, the company will seek Britain's approval to develop
the field, starting next fall, at an estimated cost of $600
million. Production is expected to begin in the second half
of 1992. Occidental is the well operator and holds a 36.5%
interest in it.
