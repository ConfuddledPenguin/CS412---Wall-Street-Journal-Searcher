   NEW YORK -- Donald Trump's bankers raced to try to
complete a $65 million bailout in time to meet a deadline
today, as Mr. Trump personally lobbied recalcitrant bankers
last night.
   Meanwhile, the banks are expected to make available $20
million in interim financing to enable Mr. Trump to make
necessary bond payments today.

   The banks must let Mr. Trump know whether they have a deal
by 10 a.m. today, participants in the negotiations said. At
that point, he must begin the daylong process of making
interest and principal payments on Trump's Castle bonds.
   Last night, people close to the negotiations grew
optimistic as Mr. Trump apparently persuaded some holdout
banks to go along with the deal. These banks, which weren't
identified, have bought pieces of larger loans issued by
Citicorp and were said to have been persuaded by Mr. Trump's
grasp of his financial situation and his confidence in
turning it around.
   Also last night, Societe General, a French bank that had
purchased a piece of a larger loan issued by Chase Manhattan
Bank, officially agreed to the bailout proposal, leaving West
Germany's Dresdner Bank as the sole holdout among the Chase
syndicate.
   Attorneys for Mr. Trump's major creditors huddled all
yesterday in the law offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp;
Katz, which represents Bankers Trust Corp. Under the
interim-financing proposal, in return for the $20 million Mr.
Trump is expected to give the banks a second lien on
practically every asset that isn't already encumbered,
including Trump Tower and his 50% share of the Grand Hyatt in
Manhattan.
   Mr. Trump needs the money by tonight to cure a default on
a $43 million payment of principal and interest on Trump's
Castle bonds. If the payment is not made by then, bondholders
could foreclose on the property, which could trigger defaults
on other parts of Mr. Trump's vast empire.
   Robert Douglass, Chase Manhattan Corp. vice chairman and
Lawrence Small, Citicorp vice chairman, are said to have
communicated with officials of Dresdner Bank, to try to
persuade the West German institution to agree to the deal.
Dresdner is one of four foreign banks that purchased a
portion of Chase's $75 million first mortgage on Trump Tower
in Manhattan. People close to the deal said the calls didn't
persuade Dresdner officials, though they were hopeful they
could convince the bank by early this morning.
   Both Citibank and Chase are believed to have used the
threat of a loss of future business with the recalcitrant
banks in a bid to induce them to go along with the deal.
   The $20 million interim funding proposal poses something
of a risk for Mr. Trump, people close to the negotiations
said. Mr. Trump is said to be willing to exchange collateral
for the $65 million, because the overall proposal is a
five-year plan that gives him some breathing room. But if Mr.
Trump accepts the $20 million without an iron-clad assurance
that all 70-odd of his lenders have agreed to the proposal,
he risks giving up collateral without buying the necessary
time to work out his problems.
   Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment. The banks
officially declined to comment, as well.
   Bankers involved in the negotiations said it was fairly
common for such workout talks to last until the final
seconds, because all parties are always trying to cut the
best possible deal for themselves. In this case, Dresdner and
Societe General are said to have submitted counterproposals
that would alter the basic structure of Mr. Trump's bailout.
But Mr. Trump's major banks have so far declined to change
the proposal.
   At the heart of the bailout is a restructuring of the way
Mr. Trump does business, and the way he lives his life. One
banker who has examined Mr. Trump's finances said the
developer's annual personal expenses are currently about $10
million.
   Bankers confirmed reports that, as part of the deal, Mr.
Trump would be put on a budget of approximately $450,000 a
month this year, $375,000 a month next year and $300,000 a
month in 1992. Much of that money would be debt service for
Mr. Trump's personal residences, airplanes and boats, bankers
said. Also, Mr. Trump may have to sell the Plaza Hotel in
Manhattan because that would raise the most cash, and the
West Side rail yards because they are considered to be a cash
drain.
   If the final package is approved, Mr. Trump is expected to
shift his focus to Atlantic City, N.J., where he has the
greatest potential for growth. Mr. Trump has agreed to
appoint a chief financial officer for the Trump Organization.
At least two banks have said they also want a chief executive
officer appointed, but Mr. Trump appears to have successfully
thwarted that move.
