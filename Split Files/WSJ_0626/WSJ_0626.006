   NEW YORK -- Tonka stock looks as though it has been run
over by a truck -- and not a toy truck.
   The toy maker's shares sell for less than one-third of
their 1989 high, which was 22 7/8. Yesterday, the stock
declined 1/4 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading to
close at 6 1/4, a new six-year low.

   Tonka has said that it might have a loss this year -- it
would be the company's third deficit in five years -- and
that it may be in default of a cash-flow provision in its
loan agreement with banks. It labors under a $482 million
debt load (68% of capital), and it hasn't come up with a hot
item to replace the fading Ghostbusters line and the
successful Pound Puppies of a few years ago.
   Amid these troubles, most pension funds and mutual funds
won't touch Tonka's stock. But given the sudden shifts of
fortune that often happen in the toy industry, a few risk
takers believe this is a time to hunt for a bargain. They
can't imagine that the maker of Nerf balls and Monopoly games
will go under, and they figure that if it doesn't, the stock
can't go too much lower.
   "We are long-term investors," says John F. Nelson, a money
manager with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which
bought 400,000 Tonka shares on the recent weakness, adding to
its million-share holding. "Obviously, the toy business is
cyclical, but Tonka is well positioned," he says. "They have
a stable base in the games area," with Parker Brothers, which
makes old favorites such as Monopoly and Clue.
   Mr. Nelson also likes Tonka's international presence,
particularly in Spain and other parts of Europe. There, he
says, is "where the surprise growth" is likely to come from.
   The Minnetonka, Minn., toy maker is paying now for a
gamble it took in 1987, when it acquired its larger rival,
Kenner Parker Toys Inc., for about $600 million. That saddled
Tonka with a big debt, which it has been gradually reducing,
and raised its stake in the volatile field of "promotional"
toys that often tie in with movies or television series.
   Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's, says
the financial markets are valuing Tonka at about $530 million
-- the market value of all its stock, plus the face value of
its debt. This is less than Tonka paid to buy Kenner Parker
three years ago, he notes.
   Mr. Valentine calls Tonka a "strong buy." He points out
that the company is being valued at only 60% of sales,
whereas 100% of sales is typical in toy-industry takeovers.
   Other money managers say that buying Tonka stock now is
like trying to catch a falling knife. "They're in a fight for
survival," Michael A. Connor, senior vice president at the
Connor Ballan unit of Fahnestock &amp; Co., says. "Equity is a
minus figure if you eliminate good will," he says. "I don't
see {a bankruptcy-law filing} as a certainty, but there is a
possibility."
   "I severely question the viability of the company,"
Stanley K. Jasek, a Grand Haven, Mich., toy consultant and
product developer, says. "I think Tonka will be in Chapter 11
by Christmas," a reference to the section of the federal
Bankruptcy Code that protects a company from creditors.
   In response to these comments, a Tonka spokeswoman refers
to a previous statement by the chief executive officer,
Stephen G. Shank, that a default on the bank-loan covenant
"would not signal an interest or principal payment default,"
but merely failure to maintain cash flow equal to 1.8 times
interest expense.
   Hans Sohlen, Tonka assistant treasurer, says, "We have
sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to
comfortably take us through 1990." Several Wall Street
analysts say a bankruptcy-law filing is unlikely, though some
fear Tonka may have to sell Parker Brothers.
   Technical analysts, who generally believe a declining
stock must level off and form a base before it can begin to
rise again, aren't keen on Tonka. "There's no sign of a base;
I hate it," says Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional
Tape Reader.
   "They need a hit," Carol Palmer, an analyst with Duff &amp;
Phelps, says. "They have some warm toys now, but they need
something that will be hot." One hope is Tonka's new line of
Batman toys. But the next Batman movie isn't expected until
next year at the earliest. A lot depends on how long video
games and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toys continue to hog
the limelight among boys aged 7 to 12, Tonka's main market.
   "For a near-term investor, {Tonka} is probably dead
money," Robin Young, an analyst with John G. Kinnard &amp; Co. in
Minneapolis, says. But "Long-term, there's a heck of a lot of
value there."
