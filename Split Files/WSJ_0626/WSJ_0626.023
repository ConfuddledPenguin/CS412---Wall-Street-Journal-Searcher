   STAMFORD, Conn. -- General Electric Capital Corp. said it
plans to join the parade of securities firms, banks and law
firms in the burgeoning field of offering financing to overly
indebted companies.
   The financing from GE Capital, a unit of General Electric
Co., would allow distressed companies to reduce their debt
before or after seeking bankruptcy-law protection from
creditors.

   Jeffrey H. Coats, head of GE Capital's new restructuring
group, said the company can move faster than banks in such
situations because it can offer equity financing, as well as
debt financing, and doesn't necessarily need to redistribute
the debt. He said GE Capital plans to expand the number of
people devoted to restructuring from 12 to 20 by the end of
the year.
   Recently, he said, GE Capital provided $50 million in
credit to L.J. Hooker Corp. for use prior to the liquidation
of its Bonwit-Teller and B. Altman retail units. GE also
financed a $75 million management buy-out of Hooker's
Merksamer Jewelers unit.
