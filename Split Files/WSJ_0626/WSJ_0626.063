   PARIS -- Groupe Michelin, whose $1.5 billion bid to
acquire Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. was approved by the U.S.
government in April, warned of possible renewed losses and
announced job cuts at its main central-France plants. The
news stunned analysts and sent the huge French tire maker's
stock plunging.
   Francois Michelin, the company's chairman, told a
shareholders meeting Friday that the company is in for three
or four difficult years because of a tight tire market and
heavy investment spending. He said he couldn't rule out
losses -- apparently as early as this year -- although he
said the investments would generate profit in the longer
term.

   "This comes as quite a shock to me," said Stephen Reitman,
an analyst specializing in the auto business at London
brokerage firm UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew. Because secretive
Michelin didn't announce the profit warning, news trickled
out through secondhand reports.
   "Obviously the acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
is costing them, in this high-interest-rate environment," Mr.
Reitman said. "They are giving the first indications of how
bad the competitive pressure is in the tire business."
   Michelin union leaders said they had been informed that
the tire maker will eliminate 2,260 more jobs at five plants
near its central-France headquarters and at distribution
centers across France. These represent Michelin's fourth
round of job cuts since serious losses almost killed the
French company a decade ago. Michelin said it hopes to avoid
layoffs by encouraging workers to take early retirement, work
part time or, in the case of foreign workers, return home.
   Michelin's share price plunged nine francs a share, or
8.3%, closing in Paris at 99.2 francs ($17.68) in heavy
trading. Since the start of the year, Michelin's share value
has fallen more than 40%, as analysts warn investors that the
company's well-known preoccupation with the long term could
hold down profit and dividends for some time to come.
   UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew, for example, has been advising
investors since December to sell Michelin shares, Mr. Reitman
says. That advice, however, was based on an estimate that
Michelin would post a 1.5 billion franc profit this year,
down from about 2.45 billion francs in 1989. Mr. Reitman said
the warning of possible losses will accelerate share sales,
as shareholders realize that it is almost impossible to tell
how soon they will get a return on their investments.
   News of the chairman's profit warning was slow to trickle
out because the annual meeting was closed to the press. Some
French reporters attended as shareholders, however. Michelin
officials confirmed the general thrust of their reports, as
well as a union announcement of the job cuts. Michelin said a
text of the chairman's remarks on profits would be made
available later this week, and that until then details
wouldn't be available.
   French stock market regulations require listed companies
such as Michelin to issue a statement announcing any
development that could affect share price, but the
regulations don't currently permit any penalty if the company
fails to do so.
   The profit forecast reflects Michelin's tough policy of
pursuing long-term advantage, even at the cost of short-term
pain to shareholders. Because the Michelin family and its
allies control the company, they can afford to ignore
protests. The Michelins and many analysts believe the
company's long-term orientation helps explain its survival in
a market where more and more tire makers are failing or being
acquired by competitors.
   Although the company now is sharply limiting discretionary
spending, it is maintaining major projects that other
companies might have tried to cancel. Most prominent is the
more than $1.5 billion Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition, which
has just been approved by U.S. antitrust authorities. That
pushes Michelin sales clearly beyond those of both Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber Co. of the U.S. and Bridgestone Corp. of Japan,
making the French company the world's leading tire producer.
   But a Michelin official said that is only the start of the
planned investments. He said other expansion and upgrading
projects in the U.S., Asia and Brazil could actually cost
more than the Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition over the next few
years.
