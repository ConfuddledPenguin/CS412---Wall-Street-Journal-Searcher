   Your June 1 article "Car-Rental Firms Leave Drivers Dazed
by Rip-Offs, Options, Misleading Ads" indicted the entire
car-rental industry.
   I resent the unwarranted hatchet job done on the industry
as a whole and National Car Rental in particular. You
associate us with major abuses that I admit have occurred in
this business. But they are abuses National has not been
party to.

   You berate us, for example, for charging for an extra day
after a renter kept the car past the special promotional
weekly rate time period. As most travelers know, promotions
are just that. Ask an airline if you still get the
promotional rate if you were supposed to return on a Sunday
and you suddenly decided to come back Monday morning instead.
