   The groans you hear coming from your local hospital are
not all emanating from patients. They're the protests of
nurses, hospital personnel and physicians who are forced to
live with a hodgepodge of expensive, contradictory and
confusing bureaucratic regulations.
   The federal government must be held responsible for many
of the basic costs that now confound the health-care
industry. Legislators, official commissions and bureaucrats
in Washington document deficiencies in our health-care
system, point out the need for corrective action, and then
invoke all sorts of rules, regulations and paper work.

   What are the total national costs attributable to
regulating the hospital industry? Nobody knows for sure. But
the experience at Sequoia Hospital, a 430-bed not-for-profit,
general hospital in the San Francisco Bay area, may provide
some insights. The price tag for dealing with various
regulatory bodies and government mandated paper work at my
institution is approximately $7.8 million annually.
   The change in the U.S. government's attitude -- and the
resultant burden on hospitals -- is reflected in changes at
Sequoia. The average number of inpatients today is the same
as it was in 1966. The staff is about 175% the size it was
then. Some of the rise is because the number of outpatients
has grown. Some of it is because patients need more intense
care than they did then -- the hospitalized are sicker
because government regulations prohibit admitting many
patients at the point they used to enter the hospital. Much
of it, though, is due to new requirements of government.
   To comply with the string of regulations and government
directives requires a staff of 140 full-time employees. Not
included in this count is the vast number of hours physicians
devote helping the institution comply with mandated
government audits and utilization review programs.
   The federal government insists that medical care be
continually assessed and audited for quality and
appropriateness. At Sequoia, four full-time employees and one
part-timer spend all their time reviewing patient records.
Nine or 10 employees appraise the appropriateness of
hospitalization.
   The Federal Peer Review Act mandates that all hospital
work paid for by the government be reviewed by an independent
agency under contract to the Health Care Finance
Administration. Providing duplicate hospital records, lab
reports, X-ray data and billing information to outside "peer
review agencies" is an enormous task requiring 20 additional
staffers. As for Medicare funds, to get those the hospital
must undergo a third audit, by the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
   Each auditing agency issues directives, generating
multiple forms that must be filled out by nurses, hospital
pharmacists, record-room personnel and doctors. To lighten
the paperwork load for practicing physicians, the hospital
has added four people to its medical staff office. The
government forms require formatting by three data processors.
Paper work also eats away at nurses' time.
   If Sequoia's experience is typical -- and there's no
reason to suspect it is not -- health-care regulatory costs
nationwide measure in the billions of dollars.
   When allocations are scarce, available resources should be
spent in wisdom, not in folly. Excessive regulatory activity
has not only failed to produce a health-care system to carry
us into the next century; it has weakened what we already
have. In the exhilaration of forging a new health-care
system, the government has put providers into a regulatory
straitjacket. Only a radical restructuring of all these rules
and regulations will bring order out of the present chaos.
   The best way to start solving the health-care cost crisis
is to suggest that many of the government's regulators resign
en masse, and then accept these resignations so fast they
don't even have time to hit the table. The patients would not
lose much of value. And I would surmise that people would be
much happier knowing their taxes were being spent on older
peoples' medical needs rather than on a massive government
bureaucracy.
   Am I suggesting that Uncle Sam relinquish all oversight
activities? Not at all. Oversight is not a dirty word, and
every effort should be made to conduct a review of medical
practice on a rational basis. The question is not whether
Medicare needs oversight, but the kind of oversight that is
appropriate. Uncle Sam has not been the solution to soaring
medical costs; he has been part of the problem.

   Note: Sequoia serves roughly the same number of inpatients
it did in 1966. It serves more outpatients now. But more
nurses are needed in general because patients these days are
sicker and government paperwork takes nurses' time. Sequoia
estimates that Medicare and other government programs mean it
has to hire 35 more nurses than it would otherwise need.
                                                                                                       

   Numbers may not compute because of rounding.
