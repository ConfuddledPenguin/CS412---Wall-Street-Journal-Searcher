   NEW YORK -- A securities trader accused of helping set up
$4 billion in rigged U.S. securities transactions was
sentenced to one year and a day in prison for conspiring to
defraud the U.S.
   The trader, Paul Foont, 51 years old, of Manhattan,
pleaded guilty in April. Jeffrey Feldman, 42, of Skillman,
N.J., also pleaded guilty in the scheme and is to be
sentenced July 5 in federal court in Manhattan.

   Mr. Foont was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Charles
Haight. He could be eligible for parole after serving four
months.
   Mr. Foont was head trader for a series of limited
partnerships called the Cralin partnerships. Mr. Feldman was
a principal and promoter of the partnerships. The U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan charged that the partnerships
were used in the pre-arranged transactions to create phony
losses for tax deductions of about $140 million. The
partnerships were marketed to investors for their tax
benefits, and investors didn't know that the tax losses
weren't legitimate, prosecutors said.
   Because the crime occurred in the early 1980s, new federal
sentencing guidelines don't apply in this case. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary said that under the new
guidelines, Mr. Foont would have been sentenced to 63 to 78
months in prison.
