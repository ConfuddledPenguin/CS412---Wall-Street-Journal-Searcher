   "It was a very sleepy day, almost like a holiday," said
E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a
major dealer in OTC stocks for other market professionals. "I
suspect it will be this way until after the Fourth of July,"
he added.
   Hank Striefler, OTC trading manager for Shearson Lehman
Hutton, said smaller stocks were hit hard yesterday as the
sell programs that tackled exchange-listed shares Friday
spilled over into the OTC market. However, Mr. Striefler
remained optimistic about the longer-term picture. "I think
we're near a bottom," he said, suggesting that later in the
week portfolio managers may buy smaller stocks to "window
dress" their portfolios.
   Mr. Striefler agreed with Mr. Geduld that selling was
orderly and across all OTC industry groups. He also predicted
that this week will be quiet. "The closer we get to July 4,
{trading} is going to come to a halt," he said.
   Duty Free International plunged 4 1/4 to 24 3/4. Officials
of the Ridgefield, Conn., operator of duty-free stores told
analysts that second-quarter sales at some of its stores
aren't likely to be as strong as expected, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Chief financial officer
Gerald F. Egan also said that sales last weekend at some of
its Canadian border stores were lower than expected,
following the collapse of the Meech Lake plan giving Quebec
special status.
   Price Co. jumped 2 to 38 3/4. The San Diego wholesale
cash-and-carry merchandising company reported net income for
the third quarter ended June 10 of 47 cents a share, fully
diluted, up from restated income of 42 cents a share a year
earlier.
   Sun Microsystems added 5/8 to 32 and was one of the few
technology stocks that closed higher. The Mountain View,
Calif., maker of computer workstations said that a unit of
the company renewed a one-year "master purchase agreement"
with Unisys Corp. under which Unisys will resell, and
purchase for internal development, Sun's Sparc-based
workstations and servers.
   Among other technology shares, Intel fell 1/2 to 45 1/2;
Apple Computer lost 1/4 to 41 1/4, and Microsoft slid 1 1/4
to 74 1/2. Microsoft said it's increasing its support staff
by 60 people over the next 12 weeks and inaugurating a
24-hour telephone hotline and other services to assist the
growing number of users of the 3.0 version of its Windows
software. The Redmond, Wash., software maker said sales of
the product outpaced its "most aggressive" sales predictions.
   Henley Group rose 1/4 to 31 1/4 after the La Jolla,
Calif., industrial company said it may sell as much as its
entire 38.5% stake in Itel Corp.
   California Microwave advanced 1/4 to 8 1/4. A favorable
profile of the Sunnyvale, Calif., electronics communications
company appeared in the current issue of Barron's.
   American Medical Electronics jumped 1 1/4 to 12 1/4 after
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes analyst Craig B. Dickson made bullish
comments about the Dallas maker of medical devices for the
third consecutive day, DJPIR reported. Mr. Dickson is
optimistic about the prospects for the company's device to
assist healing after spinal surgery.
   Tele-Communications stumbled 5/8 to 14 after this
newspaper reported that National Broadcasting Co. executives
privately gave little chance of success to a proposal by the
Denver cable company to use its cable systems as NBC
affiliates in rural areas not already served by the network's
affiliates.
   Software Toolworks continued to slide on heavy volume.
After the market closed, investor John R. Purcell of
Stamford, Conn., said he lowered his position in the Sherman
Oaks, Calif. software publisher to 4.3% of its outstanding
common shares.Software Toolworks fell 1/4 to 15 on 1.25
million shares.
   Biogen fell 1 to 21 1/2. Chicago-based analyst Peter F.
Drake of Vector Securities International tied the drop to
profit-taking after last week's AIDS conference in San
Francisco, according to DJPIR. Mr. Drake explained that some
investors had been expecting wider press coverage of data
presented Thursday about the Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology
company's alpha interferon product, which is used in
combination with Burroughs-Wellcome's AZT drug to treat
people who test positive for the AIDS virus but who don't yet
have symptoms. Biogen climbed as high as 23 in advance of the
conference.
   Tyson Foods dropped 1 1/4 to 31 1/2. This newspaper's
"Heard on the Street" column questioned not only why the
poultry producer recently changed its depreciation schedule,
but also whether a potential cyclical downturn in poultry
prices will affect Springdale, Ark., company's ability to
digest the $1.3 billion of long-term debt it absorbed in the
acquisition of Holly Farms.
   Liz Claiborne slipped 1 3/4 to 30 1/4. The North Bergen,
N.J., apparel maker appeared in a USA Today list of companies
reporting insider selling, with four Liz Claiborne insiders
recently selling 804,000 shares of stock.
