   Taiwan Glass Co. has postponed a convertible-bond issue,
and analysts said the delay was prompted by the long slide in
the Taipei stock market.
   The issue by Taiwan Glass, a tightly managed company that
dominates the Taiwanese domestic glass market, would have
been the nation's second convertible-bond issue open to
foreign investors.

   Late last year, Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co.
became the first Taiwan company to issue a convertible bond
marketed overseas. Though foreigners are prohibited from
directly owning shares of Taiwan companies, and though the
conversion premium on the Yuen Foong Yu issue was a steep
50%, overseas investors snapped up the bonds. Many bought
them in the belief that the government will change
regulations to allow foreign ownership of Taiwan shares
before the conversion date on the issue. (The premium is the
amount the price of the bond must increase to make conversion
to the issuer's shares on a fixed date profitable.)
   However, the Taipei stock market has lost more than 50% of
its value since the start of the year, and the Yuen Foong Yu
bonds have fallen to a deep discount to their issue price.
   Taiwan Glass said it is postponing its issue because it is
intended to fund construction of a plant in Malaysia that is
still awaiting Malaysian government approval, according to
analysts in Taipei. However, these same analysts said market
conditions likely played a large role in Taiwan Glass's
decision.
