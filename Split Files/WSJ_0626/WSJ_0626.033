   DALLAS -- Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a
lawsuit filed by James V. Jellison, a former senior assistant
postmaster general, charging that the company, two former
executives and others tried to remove him from his position
with the Postal Service.
   Under terms of the out-of-court settlement, the
manufacturer of document processing equipment said it paid an
undisclosed amount in return for the release of all claims
against the company and the former executives, William G.
Moore Jr., a former chief executive officer, and Robert W.
Reedy, a former vice president.

   The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, was based
on an indictment against Recognition and the two officers,
alleging that they tried to manipulate the award of $400
million in Postal Service contracts. A federal judge
subsequently acquitted all the defendants in the case.
