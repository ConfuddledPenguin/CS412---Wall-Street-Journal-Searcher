   DETROIT -- Sales of domestic cars, vans and trucks in the
U.S. fell 3.6% in mid-June from a weak year-ago period, as
slumping sales for the Big Three U.S. auto makers were only
partially offset by gains reported by the U.S. operations of
Japanese auto makers.
   U.S. auto makers reported sales of 341,662 vehicles in the
June 11-20 period, compared to 315,138 last year. But there
were nine selling days in the period this year compared to
eight a year ago, making the daily average sales volume drop
in the latest period.

   Analysts said the latest figures suggest the auto market
is leveling out and the worst of a nine-month-old sales slump
may be over. The market "is probably not going to get any
worse," said David Healy, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete
Wedd in New York. But he added improvements probably will
come slowly. Spokesmen for the auto makers, meanwhile, said
the latest sales were in line with expectations, and wouldn't
force significant production cutbacks or substantial
additional discounting.
   Because of sharply-reduced output earlier this year, most
major U.S. auto makers are sitting on relatively lean
inventories of unsold cars.
   In a continuation of recent market trends, sales of
passenger cars dropped more severely than van and pickup
truck sales. Auto makers reported a 4.5% decline in domestic
car sales, while combined truck and van sales fell only 2.2%.
Domestic cars sold at a 6.8 million seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the period, identical to the sluggish rate of
a year ago, according to a Commerce Department formula.
   In sharp contrast to the lackluster performances of the
Big Three auto makers, the U.S. operations of Japanese auto
makers continued to outstrip their year-ago performances.
Overall, Japanese auto makers boosted their share of U.S.
produced car sales to 13.7%, from 8.9% last year.
   Honda Motor Corp., which has added a second U.S. auto
assembly plant to its facilities in Ohio, saw sales of its
domestically-produced Civic and Accord models jump 62% in
mid-June. Honda officials credited the sales strength of the
redesigned 1990 Accord, and a dealer incentive program on its
Civic models.
   Chrysler Corp. posted the deepest sales decline. The auto
maker recorded an 18.3% drop in domestic car sales, and a
12.9% decline in sales of domestic trucks and vans.
Chrysler's market share has been declining for most of this
year despite a major marketing campaign that included a
six-city tour by Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and advertising that
compares its cars to Honda's.
   General Motors Corp., reported a 7.8% decline in domestic
car sales and a 3% drop in domestic truck sales. Ford Motor
Co. fared about the same, with domestic car sales down 7.4%
from a year ago. Officials said they were buoyed by a partial
recovery in sales of the new version of the Escort, the
company's basic subcompact model. Escort sales dropped only
3% through the first 20 days of June, compared to a decline
of 18% for the entire month of May.
   Ford's truck and van sales rose 4%, thanks largely to the
strong launch of the Ford Explorer, a four-door sport-utility
vehicle aimed squarely at Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee.
