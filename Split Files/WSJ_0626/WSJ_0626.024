   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission Monday said
it would review "with interest" the $3.8 billion takeover of
Swiss chocolate and coffee concern Jacobs Suchard by Philip
Morris Cos. of the U.S.
   The move will substantially enlarge the European position
of Kraft General Foods, Philip Morris's food-processing arm,
and could therefore affect competition within the EC.

   A spokeswoman for the Commission said, however, that it
was "very early days yet." She said that "nothing happens in
the world these days without the EC being involved in some
way or another."
   Through the move Philip Morris will acquire such brand
names as Tobler, Toblerone, Milka and Cote d'Or on the
chocolate side and Night and Day, Jacques Vabre and Carte
Noire in coffee.
