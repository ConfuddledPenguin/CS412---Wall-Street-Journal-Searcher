   NEW YORK -- Bond investors drove prices lower as they
worried about too many bonds coming to market. The stock
market tagged along, with an additional negative nudge from
some bad earnings news.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly a full
point, or $10 for each $1,000 of face amount, in light
trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 12.13
points to close at 2845.05, also on thin trading. The dollar
rose against the West German mark and the Japanese yen.

   Roberta D. Olson, fixed-income portfolio manager at Banc
One Asset Management Corp., said bond prices were poised for
a decline anyway, because they had risen to the point where
buyers were starting to show resistance to further gains.
"We're in a technical range, and we got something fundamental
to make it move down in that range," she said.
   In addition to the heavy Treasury auction schedule, the
"something" included a jump in commodities prices, mainly
grains and gold, which often are interpreted as signaling
stepped-up inflation that erodes the value of fixed-income
securities. Also, the prospect of huge government-note
auctions later this week kept many buyers on the sidelines.
   Stock prices attempted an early rally following Friday's
sharp decline, with investors looking for bargains among
battered blue chips. But the rise in bond yields that
accompanies lower bond prices, and which lessens stocks'
appeal to investors, cut the gains short.
   Adding to stock investors' anxiety were negative earnings
surprises. Caterpillar announced "substantially lower" 1990
profit expectations, largely because of a sharp decline in
results for its Brazilian unit. Also, a Shearson Lehman
Hutton analyst lowered his second-quarter earnings projection
for Quantum Chemical, citing weaker-than-expected sales of
polyethylene.
   In currency trading, the dollar gained against the mark,
primarily because traders were dumping marks to buy Swiss
francs, attracted by higher Swiss interest rates, said Eric
Lehtis, senior dealer at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank. The dollar
fell against the franc.
   Against the yen, the dollar rose because Japanese
investors are worried about signs of rising inflation in
Japan, not because they want to own dollars long-term, Mr.
Lehtis said. Buying dollars is an easy way to get out of the
yen on the way to other currencies.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in light trading, with 133.1 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Declining issues far outnumbered advancers, 1,049 to 496.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.56%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6770 marks and 155.35 yen, compared with
1.6745 marks and 154.85 yen Friday.
