   It's tough being an expectant yuppie.
   You've already chosen the kid's nanny, and all her schools
from nursery to prep. And no 20th-century ills such as toy
guns and movie violence will intrude on your progeny's peace
of mind.

   But wait: What about the single most traumatic event of
childhood, one known to cause months of sleepless nights,
crankiness, crying jags, and gastrointestinal problems? Must
even the yuppiest of babies endure -- shudder -- birth?
   Not anymore. A California doctor says he has invented a
computer-controlled bassinet that simulates the environment
of the womb, allowing parents to transform their child's
birth from a "sudden and traumatic" event to a much gentler
16-week transition period.
   "I've been playing with this concept for about 10 years
now," says James Gatts, an aerospace medicine specialist.
"For a long time, I had an awful time getting people
interested in it." (Small wonder: His prototype was made with
skateboard wheels, screen door hinges and a car radio.)
   In Dr. Gatts's device, to be marketed as "Nature's Cradle"
this August, newborns are strapped between two bolsters,
intended to recreate the pressure of the uterine walls, and
rocked in a motion that mimics the movement of the womb while
the mother is walking. A recording of a heartbeat is piped
in.
   Over a 16-week period, the heartbeat and rocking motion
gradually diminish to zero, the bolsters are loosened, and
the child has adjusted to the outside world. Dr. Gatts says
the end result is a trauma-free baby that cries less, sleeps
better, and is never colicky.
   "It's a fascinating idea," says Dr. Terri Ederscheim of
Cornell Medical Center in New York. "It could be useful. But
we aren't going to fool a baby into thinking it's "in utero".
It sounds like this thing basically mechanizes swaddling and
rocking, which parents have known about for centuries."
   The cradle, which comes with a 12-page operator's manual,
will go for about $1,200. Dr. Gatts hopes to bring the price
down to about $400.
   Future versions, he adds, will offer options like an
"infant-operated system." How could a one-week-old baby turn
anything on and off? "Well, a number of ways -- sucking on a
switch, for example."
   OK. But won't he still have trouble with the manual?
