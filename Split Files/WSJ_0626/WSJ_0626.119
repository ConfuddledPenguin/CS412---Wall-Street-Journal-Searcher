   Willcox &amp; Gibbs currently has covered-yarn operations in
the U.S. and Canada, said President Richard Mackey. It also
has interests in electrical parts. In 1989, Filix Lastex
earned $3.2 million on sales of $51 million.The agreement is
subject to conditions including approval by Willcox &amp; Gibbs's
board and clearance by the French government.
   Willcox &amp; Gibbs has reported that first-quarter net income
sank 71% to $1.2 million, or nine cents a share, reflecting a
$2 million charge for restructuring at certain divisions.
Sales rose 3.4% to $139 million.
   The company also has said it expects fully diluted
earnings per share for 1990 of $1.15 to $1.20 before unusual
charges, compared with $1.29 a share in 1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Willcox &amp; Gibbs shares closed unchanged at $10.125.
