   HOLLYWOOD -- The dizzying escalation in movie script
prices hit its highest water mark yet, as Carolco Pictures
Inc. paid $3 million for an original screenplay.
   The price paid for the script, "Basic Instinct" by former
journalist Joe Eszterhas, surpasses the $1.75 million paid by
Geffen Co. for Shane Black's "The Last Boy Scout" in April.

   According to a report in the trade paper Daily Variety
confirmed by individuals close to the negotiations, the
24-hour auction began last Thursday when MGM/UA
Communications Co., which had contractual first crack at the
script, had to "pass" on it. MGM/UA's film activities have
been slowed by a proposed acquisition by Pathe Communications
Corp. Several major studios joined the bidding but Carolco,
which recently produced "Total Recall," prevailed.
   Mr. Eszterhas, author of "Flashdance," "Music Box" and
"Betrayed," gained notoriety last year when he departed
powerful Creative Artists Agency to rejoin his former agent
Guy McElwaine at International Creative Management. Mr.
Eszterhas wrote a heated letter, later publicized, accusing
CAA chief Michael Ovitz of threatening him. Mr. Ovitz denied
it.
