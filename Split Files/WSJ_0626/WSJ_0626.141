   MINNEAPOLIS -- Aequitron Medical Inc. said it is recalling
thousands of machines that are used primarily to monitor the
respiration and heart rates of infants.
   The move, disclosed in an earnings report, is the second
time in two years that the medical device company has had to
recall monitors to fix faulty alarm systems. The monitors are
designed to set off an audible alarm if it detects irregular
respiration or heart rate.

   As in the March 1988 recall, the company said it isn't
aware of any deaths or injuries related to malfunctioning
monitors. A spokesman for the company said Aequitron detected
the latest problems itself.
   The spokesman also said the these latest recalls aren't
related to an out-of-court settlement it reached earlier this
spring with a Corpus Christi, Texas, couple who had claimed
that their baby died because an Aequitron monitor allegedly
failed. The couple also testified before a congressional
subcommittee investigating the medical instruments industry.
   The spokesman for Aequitron said the inspector general's
office of the Department of Health and Human Services
subpoenaed some of the company's monitors last winter and
that they were eventually returned to the company. The
spokesman said the company isn't aware of the status of any
inquiry by the department.
   "As far as we know, nothing is going on," he said.
   Two years ago, the company told hospitals and families to
run the model 9200 Respiration and Heart Rate Monitors on
house electrical current instead of batteries because some
machines appeared to malfunction when used in a certain
voltage range.
   This time, the problem seems to be that electro-magnetic
emissions can interfere with the monitor. What's more, the
respiration alarm on some monitors doesn't produce the steady
sound that its designers intended.
   The problems involve its 8200 apnea model and its 9200
apnea model. The spokesman said that the company doesn't know
how many of the 21,000 monitors are still being used.
   In a release about its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, the
company disclosed that it voluntarily decided to alert the
users of the monitors after discussions with the Food and
Drug Administration.
   Aequitron said it is making available to owners a kit that
is designed to reduce the sensitivity of the monitors to
electro-magnetic interference. The company said it is also
telling dealers to return monitors so it can repair the
faulty respiration alarm.
   The company said it established a $375,000 reserve to
cover the expenses of its action.
   The one-time charge for the reserve was included in the
results the company announced for the fourth quarter ended
April 30. Aequitron said it earned $101,200, or two cents a
share, compared with a loss of $416,100, or nine cents a
share, for the 1989 fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter sales rose
16.5% to $6.5 million from $5.6 million.
   Aequitron said in a release that it doesn't know how
severely the recalls will hurt its sales. But the company
said it has more than enough working capital to weather any
temporary revenue decline and that it believes that any loss
of market share would be temporary.
   The spokesman for the company said the monitors represent
about one-third of Aequitron's business.
