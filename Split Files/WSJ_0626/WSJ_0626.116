   Dayton Hudson Corp., Minneapolis, said it plans to dismiss
about 850 central-office employees of Chicago-based Marshall
Field &amp; Co. by the end of the year.
   Last week, Dayton Hudson completed its acquisition of the
upscale retailing chain from B.A.T Industries PLC of Britain
for $1.05 billion.

   Dayton Hudson said the move will slash the central-office
staff of Marshall Field by about half. The retailer said the
terminations don't include store employees or support staff.
   Employees of Marshall Field were warned in April by Dayton
Hudson that it intended to consolidate much of the retailer's
Chicago office operations in Minneapolis.
   The Marshall Field staff that remains in Chicago will
handle matters such as customer service and community
relations.
