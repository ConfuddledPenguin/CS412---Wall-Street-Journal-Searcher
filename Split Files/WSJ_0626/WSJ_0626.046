   INDIANAPOLIS -- Meridian Insurance Group Inc. said it will
post a second-quarter charge of about $2 million, citing the
effect of storms in early and mid-June. The insurer had a
year-earlier loss of $1.4 million.
   The company said that despite a favorable trend in private
passenger auto business, chances for a second-quarter profit
are "problematic," because of numerous claims from tornado
damage in parts of its marketing areas in Indiana, Ohio and
Illinois.
