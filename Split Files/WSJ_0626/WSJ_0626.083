   Hitachi Ltd. and Motorola Inc., under pressure from a
court deadline this week in their patent squabbles, have
decided to try to work them out on their own.
   The two companies said they have agreed in principle to
discussions aimed at ending a dispute involving the Hitachi
H8/532 microprocessor and the Motorola MC 68030
microprocessor.

   "This is not a final agreement," a Hitachi spokesman said,
and it isn't expected to bring about a swift resolution of
the 18-month-old litigation. "Hitachi would like to see an
agreement in two to three months," he said.
   Nor would it resolve any of the other intellectual
property and technology disputes in which the two electronic
giants have long been embroiled, the spokesman added.
   A spokeswoman for Motorola, Schaumburg, Ill., said she
couldn't discuss any details of the negotiations.
   "As to what's on the table right now, we can't talk about
any of it," she said.
   The microprocessors at stake in the suit are lucrative
sources of revenue for the combatants.
   Hitachi doesn't sell the H8/532 yet in the U.S. However,
it represents about 1% of Hitachi's world-wide semiconductor
revenues, or $30 million. And Hitachi had counted on
extending its marketing of the H8/532 to the U.S. in the near
future, the spokesman said.
   Motorola's market-leading MC 68030 microprocessor is used
in powerful machines made by Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Hitachi
closed at $95 a share, down $1.75 from Friday's close.
Motorola closed at $84.125 a share, down $1.875.
   On March 29, a federal court judge ruled that neither
company could manufacture or distribute the disputed products
in the U.S. because each side is infringing, the Hitachi
spokesman said.
   Motorola, for its part, obtained a temporary stay of the
injunction against product sales. Last week, however, a judge
vacated that stay in a setback to Motorola, which promptly
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
   That stay of judgment is due to expire Friday, increasing
the pressure on both companies to reach a settlement out of
court.
