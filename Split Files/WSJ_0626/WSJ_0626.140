   WASHINGTON -- Last week the federal government held a pep
rally for its prosecutors.
   President Bush attended the Friday session, promising with
the help of the assembled U.S. Attorneys a new crackdown on
savings-and-loan criminals. Three times the lawmen stood to
applaud the boss. Then the Marine Corps Band struck up "God
Bless America."

   But earlier last week, in a nondescript federal office
building in Dallas, the real work of trying to put S&amp;L crooks
in jail was being carried out by Murray Neighbors and Russell
Shelton of the Internal Revenue Service. And they were in no
mood for cheering.
   The two investigators unfurled a three-by-four-foot
schematic diagram of a $32 million Texas S&amp;L loan gone bad.
The pyramid-shaped map of intersecting arrows, circles and
dollar signs showed how dozens of insiders, real-estate
developers and middlemen purportedly looted the thrift by
means of the complex loan arrangement.
   The IRS team has tracked this one loan for 2 1/2 years.
With a little luck and a few cooperating witnesses, there may
be as many as 15 indictments in the case -- a year from now.
   Even then, the charges will probably be narrow tax-evasion
counts -- not the kind of sweeping fraud charges that
taxpayers are clamoring for. Finding enough solid evidence to
prove a larger conspiracy allegation "could take the rest of
our lives," Mr. Neighbors says glumly. "We've been through
millions of {pages of} documents already."
   If there were an S&amp;L equivalent of "Hawaii Five-O," it
would be in Dallas, the apparent epicenter of S&amp;L fraud and
now the showcase of the federal crackdown. But in a close-up
look at a successful prosecution, it's clear why so few of
the perpetrators have so far gone to jail. The bottom line:
There's no smoking gun or hidden-camera videotape in an S&amp;L
heist. The evidence is a complex paper trail, a chain of
evidence that's usually ice-cold by the time prosecutors lay
their hands on it.
   "Incriminating stuff doesn't just roll off the truck,"
says Michael Santimauro, an FBI supervisor in Dallas, where a
multiagency task force has filled 14,000 square feet of
office and warehouse space with subpoenaed documents.
   What's more, no matter how many convictions the government
piles up, little of the tens of billions of dollars lost in
the nation's S&amp;L debacle will ever be recovered. Criminal
fines and court-ordered restitution in a given case rarely
exceed several million dollars. And big chunks of the thrift
industry's losses are sunk into failed shopping malls and
empty condominium developments. Most failed S&amp;Ls didn't
collapse directly because of criminal activity; egregious
mismanagement and feckless regulation were more often the
culprits.
   Still, American taxpayers, bracing for decades of higher
taxes from the scandal, demand to know whether those who did
steal money from the loosely regulated S&amp;Ls are being brought
to justice. Thus, both Democrats and Republicans increasingly
fixate on the criminal aspect of the S&amp;L debacle, imbuing the
issue with fiercely partisan hyperbole and outright
misstatement.
   Democrats charge that the Bush administration has been
soft on S&amp;L crime. "Not one indictment has been handed down,"
says Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee.
   That statement is wrong. The three-year-old Dallas task
force, after early organizational troubles, has in fact
brought charges against 77 people and obtained 52
convictions, with only two acquittals. Increasingly,
defendants are getting prison terms, including a 30-year
sentence for the former chief of the defunct Vernon Savings &amp;
Loan in Dallas.
   At the same time, though, President Bush has exaggerated
the adequacy of the federal dragnet. In Denver, for instance,
where 30 failed financial institutions are under criminal
investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigaton doesn't
have "anywhere near the people we need to keep up," says the
area's special agent in charge, Robert Pence. "Do we have a
large backlog?" asks Denver U.S. Attorney Michael Norton.
"Yes, we have a big backlog."
   In Oklahoma, U.S. Attorney Tim Leonard has a mere five
lawyers available to supervise some 40 investigations in
Oklahoma City alone. Until very recently, he acknowledges,
"these cases were stagnating."
   The Bush administration's claim that it has responded
sufficiently to the avalanche of S&amp;L cases even has been
undercut by the Justice Department's own calculations. In a
study of 59 field offices last year, the FBI concluded it
needed 425 new agents to begin work on some 2,300 languishing
thrift fraud and embezzlement cases. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh has since deployed 202 additional agents -- fewer
than half of what the FBI requested.
   A look at the government's successful INFOUR investigation
-- named for the "infamous four" institutions controlled by
Sammy Wayne Spikes, a West Texas wheeler-dealer, illustrates
just how difficult these S&amp;L cases are.
   The Spikes case dates to 1984, when four of the
financier's banks went belly up almost at once. Banking
regulators came in to clean up the mess -- making sure that
depositors were made whole, for instance. But while the
regulators have civil police powers, they aren't criminal
investigators. That job belongs to the FBI.
   In January 1985, the regional FBI office in Dallas began
sorting through dozens of referrals from the regulators --
all suggesting areas of inquiry, such as suspicious-looking
loans, but that's it. Regulators typically don't look for, or
pass along, specific incidents of criminal misconduct.
   The number of these pending referrals lies at the heart of
the burgeoning partisan conflict in Washington. Congressional
Democrats, eager to embarrass the Bush administration, have
stressed that the FBI has a backlog of nearly 7,000 criminal
referrals from S&amp;L regulators.
   But agents in the field insist that many of these alerts
describe stupid or negligent business practices, falling well
short of possibly illegal conduct. "We've got to have a
reasonable belief that a crime has been committed," says
Thomas Rupprath, a senior FBI agent in Dallas.
   With their limited manpower, investigators perform a kind
of legal triage, saving and throwing out referrals on the
basis of whether they can be easily and quickly tied to a
specific criminal statute. Another consideration is which
referrals will get the attention of the prosecuting attorney.
In the Spikes case, regulators repeatedly referred cases in
which the thrifts exceeded their lending limits. But the FBI
ruled out such referrals. To interest a busy prosecutor,
"you'd have to have something with a lot more meat on it,"
explains Dale Hogue, one of three FBI agents assigned to the
case.
   Like some of his colleagues with the Dallas task force,
Mr. Hogue, a 14-year veteran, has an accounting degree and
experience working on conventional financial fraud cases. The
Spikes case went far beyond his training and expertise. This
wasn't embezzlement -- something that the FBI is
well-equipped to investigate. This was essentially a
real-estate case -- involving home-grown transactions the
likes of which he had never seen during an earlier post
investigating bank fraud in Boston.
   "I felt like I was going back to school," he says.
   The Spikes case sent him chasing down numerous blind
alleys. He began stitching together other suspicious-looking
transactions, including cases where Mr. Spikes appeared to be
shuttling bad loans from one institution to another, keeping
just one step ahead of the regulators. The agent spent months
issuing subpoenas and deciphering records. But he ultimately
abandoned that aspect of the investigation because it seemed
too complicated to explain to a jury.
   The winnowing process involved several million pages of
personal financial statements, loan applications, canceled
checks, land title statements -- even divorce records, which
revealed the location of houses and bank accounts. The
investigations consumed three offices on the fourth floor of
the federal building in Lubbock. "We took off Christmas Day,
New Year's Day and I think Thanksgiving," recalls Roger
McRoberts, an assistant U.S. Attorney.
   Although the proof lies in the paperwork, in this as in
all criminal cases the best leads often come from human
beings, not documents. In this case, the vengeful ex-wife of
a Spikes associate described some kind of funny business
involving a land transaction. "She was wrong on all the facts
-- the state, the people and land involved, everything -- but
she did know the name of a lawyer" who was familiar with the
deal, recalls Mr. Hogue. The lawyer, in turn, named a
now-defunct Colorado thrift called Key Savings &amp; Loan. The
thrift, they found, had made a large loan integral to a
complex and illegal set of transactions called a land flip.
   The participants had set up a series of dummy corporations
to buy and sell 8,000 acres of useless New Mexico desert. The
fraudulent exchanges, orchestrated by Mr. Spikes and some of
his cronies, pushed the real estate's "price" from $800,000
to nearly $4 million, increasing its value as collateral. The
greater the collateral, the greater the sums that could be --
and were -- borrowed against it.
   "You don't have to be real sophisticated to understand
that, so we went with it," says Mr. McRoberts.
   Elapsed time so far: two years.
   Mr. Hogue relied on his accounting experience to create
ornate handwritten spreadsheets on each participant's
day-to-day financial dealings. One tracked dozens of
high-flying deals made by a shill for Mr. Spikes who was
himself on the edge of bankruptcy but was still getting a
surprising amount of bank and thrift credit.
   Rather than leaving that entire aspect of the case to some
financial esoterica, the prosecutors struck a deal with the
borrower -- under which he pleaded guilty to lesser charges
and provided essential testimony for the government.
   In the end, Mr. Spikes also pleaded guilty in December
1986, and is now serving a 10-year term in Big Springs Prison
Camp south of Lubbock. Three defendants went to trial, where
prosecutors had to balance simplicity against the demand to
prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. It wasn't easy.
Complex appraisals, some of them fraudulent, had been
conducted on the New Mexico real estate involved in the land
flip. But what prosecutors say grabbed the jury were the
photographs of sand and sagebrush -- land supposedly worth $4
million. The three were convicted in 1987.
   The best cases are the "live" ones -- the referrals
involving actual crimes under way at the time, when
witnesses' recollections are strong and when the suspects
have left fresh tracks through the paper trails.
Unfortunately, the opportunity for most such prosecutions has
come and gone. Prosecutors realized too late that
deregulation of the thrift industry, beginning in 1980, would
inevitably create new opportunities for wrongdoing.
   "With 20-20 hindsight, it seems maybe law enforcement
should have been better prepared," says Dallas U.S. Attorney
Marvin Collins, a Republican named by former President
Reagan. "But at the time, that didn't occur to people. It
certainly didn't occur to me."
   To the investigators, there are rewards even from a
conviction on narrow grounds after years of work. "We take
this personally here," says Mr. Neighbors of the IRS. "I
bought a house here a few years ago that's worth about
$25,000 less now because of this S&amp;L bull."
