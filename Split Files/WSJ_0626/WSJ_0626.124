   Microsoft Corp. says sales of its new software product
Windows 3.0 have so far exceeded its most agressive
predictions.
   The Redmond, Wash,-based software company didn't disclose
its internal forecasts or say how much sales outstripped
expectations. The new software tool was introduced with
fanfare just five weeks ago.

   However, David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Bros. said he expects Microsoft to sell 500,000 units of
Windows 3.0 between its May 22 introduction date and June 30.
   In response to the crush of demand, Microsoft said it is
establishing a 24-hour hotline providing user support for the
new product. The company said it also plans to add 60
additional people to its support staff to handle consumer
needs.
