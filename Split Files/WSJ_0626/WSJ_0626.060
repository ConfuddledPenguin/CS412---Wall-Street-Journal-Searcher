   In these opening decades of the 21st century, we all
remember the initial victories of the Animal Rights
Revolution over fur coats, those despicable symbols of
cruelty and wealth. This was relatively easy because the
wealthy are much given to guilt feelings. Somewhat more
difficult was the triumph over wool, leather and all other
materials and food derived from animals. Despite resistance
from sybarites and carnivores, human dress and diet gradually
came to be based on synthetics and plants. The movement
easily defeated a brief, left-radical assault by advocates of
Plants' Rights.
   Of course, we are still thrilled to recall the difficult
but successful campaign against allegedly "scientific"
experimentation on animals. Protests that many cures for
disease would be lost, and the potential human life span
shortened, were eventually drowned out. Moreover, who says --
apart from some misguided religious teachers and so-called
moral philosophers -- that a human life is more important
than an animal life?

   The real breakthrough came in the late 1990s with the
realization that human language, too, was a gross violation
of Animal Rights. After all, what was language other than a
conspiracy to build a world in which animals could not take
part because they did not command the human tongue? No, it
was quite clear that human language had to be eliminated to
assure full animal rights.
   Journalists, other scribblers and academics resisted
furiously. Politicians, after a period of indecision, came
around, as they found that they could do quite well by
waving, shouting, grunting and making faces -- besides saving
a lot of money on speechwriters. Businessmen at first liked
the prospect of abolishing language (in a sense, they had
already done so by inventing the corporate memo). But they
soon discovered that numbers were part of language, and that
there could be no bottom line without it.
   The movement received decisive help from the young, who
enthusiastically favored raw emotion and instinctive action
without the stultifying interference of words and grammar.
   Today we have not yet stamped out language. But it is
confined to a small minority, including this writer, who use
it to chronicle the past. Most Animal Revolutionists believe
this is a futile and probably nefarious activity that will
cease before long.
   Meanwhile the supreme battle has begun -- the battle
against "civilization." Surely there can be no doubt that
civilization is merely a gigantic human plot to rob animals
of their birthright, of their natural habitat -- earth --
which they ruled as sole masters during the millennia before
that aberration called the human race made its appearance.
Cities, abominable engines for the exclusion and destruction
of animals, are shrinking. So is industry. Its decline, of
course, interferes with the production of synthetics,
pointing to nudity as the true way.
   We have ended the proliferation of technology, that
arch-enemy of animals who, in their blessed state, do not
understand it or create it. The automobile is a scarcely
remembered contrivance; fortunately it has not been replaced,
as some reactionaries hoped, by those ancient carriages that
outrageously exploit horses. If moving on foot is good enough
for animals, it is surely good enough for humans.
   Nature has reclaimed vast urban areas and, gradually,
animals are taking over the land that belongs to them. The
long-range solution surely is the disappearance of the human
species itself, leaving the earth to its rightful masters.
   It is amazing to think that, in the days of their modest
beginnings, Animal Rights Activists were considered by many
to be harmless cranks, at worst distracting attention from
urgent social and political problems. In fact, as we now
know, they embodied a revolutionary principle aimed at
nothing less than the overthrow of mankind, and of that most
horrible of its instruments, human intelligence.
