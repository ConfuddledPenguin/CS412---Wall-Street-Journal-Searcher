   Edwin Wilson is, of course, correct in noting that the
production each year of 200 new plays at theaters all across
the U.S. makes the task of Pulitzer Prize drama jurors a
difficult one ("Good Regional Play Points Up Bad Pulitzer
Problem," Leisure &amp; Arts, June 14). Like Mr. Wilson, the
Pulitzer Prize Board is keenly aware of this situation and
continually seeks ways to ensure that regional theater is
covered as thoroughly as possible. For some years now it has
encouraged its drama jurors to travel at board expense to
regional theaters that appear to have particularly promising
offerings. And this year, in keeping with a decision taken
last November, it has increased the number of drama jurors
from three to five in order to make possible a broader
geographic representation.
   Between these measures and the fact that as professional
critics our drama jurors can reasonably be presumed to be
aware of what is going on at theaters in their various
regions of the country, I would submit that the Pulitzer
selection system is a good deal more equitable and
comprehensive than Mr. Wilson recognizes.
