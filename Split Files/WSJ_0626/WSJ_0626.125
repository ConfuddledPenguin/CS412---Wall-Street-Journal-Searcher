   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. removed New Jersey's
triple-A general obligation and related agency bonds from a
list of state issues being watched for possible downgrade,
after the state Legislature passed a series of
revenue-raising measures.
   On March 19, S&amp;P had placed New Jersey on its CreditWatch
list with negative implications, after Gov. James Florio's
budget indicated a "substantial gap-closing" measure would be
needed to balance the budget. Over the weekend, the
Legislature approved a package that included a $1.5 billion
increase in revenue from a boost in the state's sales taxes
and a $1.3 billion increase in revenue from a rise in the
state's income tax.

   "We had fiscal concerns that they took quick action to
correct," an S&amp;P spokesman said.
   S&amp;P's latest move means that New Jersey will remain one of
only eight states whose debt is rated triple-A by both S&amp;P
and Moody's Investors Service Inc.
