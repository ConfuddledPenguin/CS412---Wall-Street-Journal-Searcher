   MACON, Ga. -- Charter Medical Corp., the giant psychiatric
and acute-care hospital chain that was once the picture of
corporate health, is beset by serious ailments.

   -- Federal health-care investigators are examining the
company for possible Medicare and Medicaid fraud. James
Cottos, regional inspector general for investigations for the
Health Care Financing Administration in Atlanta, said the
probe, which was initiated about 45 days ago, is focusing on
whether the company inflated its Medicare and Medicaid bills
for in-patient psychiatric hospital care.
   -- The company is reeling from the recent announcement of
a $35 million special charge, the result of a pervasive
accounting sleight of hand by employees, whom the company
says were apparently trying to make the bottom line look
rosier. In the midst of a special audit of the matter by the
company's outside auditors and attorneys, William A.
Fickling, chairman and president, fired, among others, James
D. Daher, executive vice president, hospital operations. Mr.
Daher, who reported directly to Mr. Fickling, says he was
unfairly blamed for the problems, though no reason was given
for his dismissal.
   -- Employee morale is slumping, particularly since the
abrupt dismissal earlier this month of 600 workers, 3% of the
work force, in an effort to cut soaring expenses. Some people
were informed of their dismissal by telephone, though Charter
insists it was only a few.
   -- Charter's basic business, psychiatric care, has taken a
turn for the worse. Expenses are up. Hospital occupancy rates
have fallen. And insurance companies and employers have
targeted psychiatric hospital care as a top priority for
reducing the ever-growing cost of employee benefits.
   Any downturn in business is particularly ominous for
Charter, which is shouldering a heavy load of $1.6 billion in
debt incurred in a 1988 leveraged buy-out by Mr. Fickling and
senior management.
   Charter's junk bonds have taken a beating recently as a
result of the special charge and concerns about prospects for
Charter's basic operating business. Several high-yield bond
analysts believe the company is headed toward a restructuring
of its debt.
   Yesterday, prices of the company's junk bonds fell sharply
on news of the Medicare-Medicaid investigation. Bids dried up
in the morning. Late yesterday Charter's 14.25% subordinated
debentures due in 2002, were being offered at 21, down three
points, or a loss of $30 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The 14% senior subordinated debentures were offered
at 38, down six points.
   Charter has found itself under fire in the past, but
primarily for its unabashed bottom-line orientation and
highly aggressive marketing, particularly for adolescent
psychiatric patients. "This is the first time these guys have
had to deal with roadblocks or even substantial obstacles to
making money," says George Pillari of Health Care Investment
Analysts Inc., Baltimore.
   Details of the Medicare and Medicaid fraud investigation
remain sketchy. However the inspector general's office said
yesterday that it initiated the investigation after someone
made allegations of fraud related to reimbursement for
psychiatric hospital care under Medicare and Medicaid. The
probe is apparently focusing on whether the company
improperly billed the programs for its home office expenses.
"At this point, it's just an allegation that has to be
resolved," said Mr. Cottos, of the inspector general's
office. He said the scope of the alleged impropriety had yet
to be determined.
   For fiscal 1989, Charter said it received 15% of its
psychiatric hospital care revenue from Medicare, the federal
health care insurance program for the elderly and disabled,
and Medicaid, the federal-state program for the needy, aged,
blind and disabled and low-income families with children. The
company said it is cooperating with the authorities.
   The Medicare-Medicaid probe comes as Charter is struggling
to recover from the revelations this spring about its
accounting irregularities. Charter said a large number of its
hospitals (it won't say how many) were reporting monthly
financial results in a way that significantly underestimated
their bad debts, or uncollectible receivables, and failed to
properly take into account contractual allowances that reduce
revenue. It says, in addition, expenses were improperly
deferred, for example, by capitalizing advertising costs
rather than listing them as expenses.
   It isn't clear how long the ruse went on. Charter, which
booked the $35 million charge in its second quarter, says
much of the problem occurred in the first six months of this
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Robert F. McCullough,
managing partner of the Atlanta office of Arthur Andersen &amp;
Co., Charter's outside auditor, says some of the inaccuracies
were traced to 1989 and that, indeed, warning signs of a
problem of inadequate reserves turned up during the year-end
audit last fall.
   However, some evidence suggests the problem may have
started long before then. Three managers, a hospital
administrator in Texas and two controllers, who were
dismissed from Charter in 1987 say they were pressured by
corporate-level colleagues to understate bad-debt reserves.
The administrator complained to the Securities and Exchange
Commission in October 1987.
   "At the hospitals, we called it `Dialing for Dollars,'"
says the administrator. Adds Rick Miller, who says he was
fired as a controller at Charter's Cleveland, Texas,
hospital, "What they were telling us to do was to falsify the
bottom line."
   Charter acknowledges that the SEC made an informal
investigation of the company's records in 1987. But Robert
Miller, an outside attorney for Charter, says by late 1987 or
early 1988, "The company received information from the SEC
that it was not going to take any action."
   Now, however, the SEC's interest seems again to be piqued.
While it doesn't appear that a formal investigation is under
way, an SEC official last week called the former Texas
hospital administrator with more questions, in an apparent
effort to re-examine the issue, he says. Charter officials
say they have no knowledge of an SEC probe. The SEC declined
to comment.
   In an interview, Mr. Daher says he "did not condone" the
accounting irregularities and was "devastated and humiliated"
when told of them. He speculates that extreme pressures on
hospitals to meet targets, particularly during difficult
times, may have spawned the problem. "Charter hires
overachievers, people who want to excel and do well," he
says. "Perhaps the environment got too tough, and rather than
not keep up, perhaps they hedged a little bit."
   Indeed, Charter recently revamped its bonus-incentive
program that rewards workers who meet targets so it is based
in part on cash brought into a hospital instead of net
income. The idea is to quell the temptation to fudge results
and to improve the collection of receivables, says J. Rodney
Laughlin, executive vice president, human resources and
development.
   Beyond the accounting woes, Wall Street analysts say,
Charter may have difficulty servicing its debt in the face of
insurers' efforts to reduce the length and cost of
psychiatric care. For instance, while hospital admissions
rose 20% in the latest quarter, patient days rose only 8% and
expenses soared 26%. Most significantly to a company with
heavy debt, Charter's operating cash flow in the second
quarter, even adjusting for the special charge, was $53
million, far short of the $78 million in the year-earlier
period.
   That figure is "well below what they need and what anybody
expected," says Amil Schiaffino, an analyst with Wertheim
Schroder &amp; Co.
   C. Michael Ford, chief financial officer, says Charter
stands by its statement in its quarterly report saying it can
meet its debt payments. But he wouldn't elaborate or provide
the company's basis for its belief. Restructuring its debt
would be "very painful" and "something that would have to be
given serious thought" before being acted upon, says Mr.
Ford, adding that such a move isn't imminent.
   As a result of the tough times, Charter is slashing costs.
In addition to the layoffs, the company has revised downward
its capital expenditures budget for this fiscal year by 30%
to $140 million from $200 million.
   Both moves, however, could end up hurting the company in
the long run, analysts say. The layoffs, for instance,
included most of the corporate marketing department, an
office that Charter has long depended on to help fill
hospital beds. And the lowered capital expenditures, while
still allowing Charter to complete construction of 10
hospitals this year, may curtail future expansion.
