   Bond investors, beware: Many of those high-yielding,
long-term bonds you bought in the early 1980s aren't going to
last nearly as long as you had hoped.
   Buried in the fine print of most corporate and municipal
bonds is language entitling the issuer to "call," or redeem,
the bonds well before the scheduled maturity date. And that's
exactly what many companies and municipalities are planning
to do over the next few years, as their bonds become eligible
for redemption, because interest rates today are much lower
than when they issued the bonds.

   Bond calls usually are bad news for investors, but not
knowing about them can be even worse. Just ask investors
holding "bearer" bonds, where the owner's name isn't on
record anywhere. They typically don't discover their bonds
have been called until they try to cash their interest-rate
coupons at their bank, months after the bond was called. Then
they wind up losing many months of interest payments.
   Starting today, The Wall Street Journal begins a weekly
feature designed to help investors spot bond calls more
easily. Entitled "Redemption Notices," it is a listing of
municipal and corporate bonds called for partial or complete
redemption during the week. Compiled initially from
advertisements in this newspaper, it will also include
preferred stock and other securities being redeemed, as well
as sinking-fund redemptions. The list will appear each
Tuesday in the Money &amp; Investing section.
   The idea came from readers who wrote or called this
newspaper. "This would be a big help because this is a very
big problem for me and many of my friends," says Henry W.
Tavs, an investor living in Miami. "We have suffered
substantial losses because we haven't found out our bonds
were recalled until many months later."
   However, this weekly listing won't include all bond calls,
because there is no requirement that every issuer notify a
single central source. Many state and local government
issuers, for example, advertise their call notices only in
trade publications and local publications.
   The Bond Buyer, a trade publication, carries a daily
listing of municipal bonds that are being called, as well as
a longer list each Wednesday. Its list is based largely on
advertisements in its own pages and "any other information we
can find," including clipping services from local papers
across the country, says John H. Allan, editor. But a
subscription costs $1,575 a year. Several other
organizations, including Kenny Information Systems Inc.,
Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
also compile bond-call lists.
   Finding out about a bond call shouldn't be a problem for
investors whose bonds are in "registered" form, which means
the issuer has the investors' names and addresses. Then it's
the issuer's responsibility to notify investors of its
decision to retire the bonds early.
   But many bonds issued prior to the early 1980s came in
bearer form. Of the $784 billion of municipal bonds now
outstanding, about 20% are in bearer form, estimates the
Public Securities Association, a trade group. Eventually, the
problem will disappear because bearer bonds aren't being
issued in the U.S. anymore, due to tax-law changes. But the
problem will become much more extensive over the next few
years, when a torrent of bond calls is expected as
municipalities and companies refinance older debt.
   Because of this trend, some investment advisers urge
investors worried about the problem to try converting their
bearer bonds into registered form. In some cases, issuers
will convert the bonds into registered form for free. But in
other cases, the bonds were issued only in bearer form and
can't be converted. Also, many investors refuse to part with
their bearer bonds, because they like the anonymity such
bonds give them.
   Government officials complain that bearer-bond lovers
often are tax cheats or people trying to hide income from a
spouse. But some investors reply that they prefer bearer
bonds because they don't trust issuers to send their interest
payments on time, or because they feel safer holding onto
their certificates than relying on a registered issue's
computer entry someplace.
   Another alternative for investors worried about missing
bond calls is to buy U.S. Treasury securities. Most of these
can't be called prior to their final maturity date. Or
investors can buy shares of bond mutual funds and let the
fund's managers worry about calls. Or they can leave their
bonds in safekeeping with their brokers or investment
advisers.
   Figuring out whether your bond is likely to be called can
be very tricky. Bonds can be called for many reasons,
although it's safe to assume that bonds paying double-digit
rates will be called at the first chance issuers get. Thus,
investors who buy bonds today should insist that their
brokers provide them with details. Also be sure to ask for
the bond's yield to the first available call date, not just
the yield to maturity. The difference can be very
significant.
   Even veteran bond traders often are stunned to discover a
bond they thought couldn't be called for years suddenly has
been called. "It's hard even for the pros to keep up with all
these calls," says D. Christopher Taylor, president of
Greenwich Money Management Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. "For the
nonprofessional, it's `buyer beware.'"
   Among the organizations investigating the problem is the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Washington, D.C.,
organization that regulates all securities firms and dealer
banks in municipal securities. "We are aware of the need for
a central source for information" on municipal bonds in
general, including bond calls, says Christopher A. Taylor,
executive director. "But we're not equipped to take all that
in right now and make it available to everyone."
   The following is a listing of securities called for
partial or complete redemption during the week ended June 22,
1990. The notices are taken from advertisements appearing in
editions of The Wall Street Journal, and are not meant to be
definitive. Inquiries regarding specific issues should be
directed to the paying agent or, if none is listed, the
issuer.
