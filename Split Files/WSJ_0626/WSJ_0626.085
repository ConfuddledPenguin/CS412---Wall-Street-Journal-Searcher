   Although many foreign companies have bought U.S. concerns
in recent years, few have snapped up so many small,
entrepreneurial firms as London's BET PLC.
   Since 1982, BET has laid out some #225 million ($389
million) for 30 small- and medium-sized private American
companies, all in BET's basic business of supplying support
services to industrial, commercial and public-sector
companies. Among other things, BET companies erect
scaffolding, pick up garbage and clean hospital laundry; they
even do windows.

   A look at BET shows why big foreign companies are rushing
to buy small U.S. ones. But it also shows that not every U.S.
company can hope to enjoy a windfall by becoming a foreign
company's target.
   "We buy a small fraction of what we look at," says
Michelle A. Prouix, vice president for corporate development
at BET Services Inc., the company's principal American unit.
"We take every target through such a rigorous process that a
lot of them fail on a number of points."
   Like many foreign companies buying in the U.S., BET aims
to build an international reputation in businesses in which
it is established elsewhere. To do this, BET and others
believe it's essential to establish operations in the U.S.
Though highly competitive in most industries, the U.S. is
large enough and rich enough to justify the risks of entry,
foreign executives say.
   Moreover, many European executives especially like the
U.S. entrepreneurial management style, which they see as
"bottom-line oriented, aggressive and lean-and-mean," says
Martin Sikora, editor of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions newsletter in
Philadelphia.
   In some industries, such as drugs, computers and
automobiles, globalization is necessary for survival, Mr.
Sikora says. But companies outside these groups are
increasingly interested in foreign operations, too. "National
borders have become less and less relevant to many companies,
even when there's no pressing need to go global," Mr. Sikora
says.
   BET, for one, has expanded in several European, Asian and
African countries as well as the U.S. and Canada. ("We're the
largest unknown company in the world," quips Clyde E. Walton,
BET Services' managing director.)
   And BET has found no better way to grow than buying small
enterprises. After all, competition in most of BET's chosen
fields is extremely fragmented. The top five companies in a
given region and field commonly have only 20% of the market
among them. Often, the other 80% of the market will be
divided among dozens, or even hundreds, of tiny firms, BET
says.
   As for the companies acquired by BET, they lose their
independence but often can grow faster because of the
availability of financing from their new parent. Consider
what happened after BET acquired Saf-TGreen of California
Inc., a scaffolding company in City of Industry, Calif., for
about $24 million. Mr. Walton says Saf-TGreen then went on a
$110 million spending spree of its own, buying out some
rivals.
   Besides buying U.S. companies directly, BET picked up some
U.S. operations along with European acquisitions, and it has
started up some new U.S. units. Now BET has 60 "strategic
business units" in this country. "We've reached critical mass
in our chosen business lines," which are maintenance, waste
services, scaffolding and distribution, says Mr. Walton.
   Like many acquirers, BET seeks strong companies with a
record of generating earnings. "We've never been turnaround
specialists," Mr. Walton says. "We've always specialized in
buying good companies."
   BET, along with many other foreign acquirers, places a
strong emphasis on maintaining management continuity in a new
and often unfamiliar market. "If the management doesn't want
to stay, in most cases we aren't interested," Mr. Walton
says. "And if it's truly a one-man show, we're not
interested." (In exceptional cases, he concedes, it may be
advantageous to buy a small company anyway, rather than let
it go to a competitor.)
   What BET says it is not looking for is risk, and the
potential liabilities are what stop some deals from going
through. Ms. Prouix says BET walked away from one transaction
"at a late stage" when the target -- a laundry company --
couldn't prove it hadn't been pouring toxic chemicals down
its drain.
   In addition, BET says it won't buy any company at a price
that would dilute the parent company's share earnings,
however slightly, for even one year.
   In most of its markets, BET is in a position to be choosy:
There are plenty of potential targets. If one deal falls
through, another will always be possible. But competition has
been so fierce in some fields that even BET has been daunted.
In the waste-management field in this country, for instance,
Waste Management Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.
"took out anything that moved," leaving few targets for BET,
Mr. Walton says. "We looked very carefully, and we decided
that the entry costs were too high," he adds.
   Even when it has a wide range of targets, of course, BET
doesn't always hit the mark. In two cases, it had to change
the management of acquired units. "In one case, there was a
problem of keeping a former owner motivated when we had just
turned him into a multimillionaire," Mr. Walton says.
Although he had cleared all the acquisition hurdles, this
manager proved to be a poor performer for BET.
   And in a few cases, BET has divested itself of assets.
Some textile-rental businesses failed to meet performance
targets, for example, and BET had second thoughts about the
business niche. "That was a product-mix issue," Mr. Walton
says.
   Having attained the "critical mass" it was seeking, BET
says its acquisition pace is greatly slowing down. But Mr.
Walton says the buying will never entirely stop. "Family
businesses have kept our entrepreneurial approach alive," he
says. "That's an invaluable contribution."
