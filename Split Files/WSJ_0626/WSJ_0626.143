   A court-appointed referee in Michigan valued heiress Joan
Irvine Smith and her mother's 11% stake in Irvine Co. at
about $149.1 million, 30% more than they were offered by
developer Donald Bren in 1983 when he bought out all of the
other investors in the real-estate concern.
   The referee, Robert B. Webster, ruled that Irvine was
worth $1.355 billion in 1983, far less than the $3 billion
proposed by Mrs. Smith and her mother. Mr. Bren paid $200,000
a share to 33 other Irvine investors, based on a total value
for the company of $1 billion at the time.

   The long-awaited decision is a major victory for Mr. Bren,
a 57-year-old real-estate baron who had been called the
"Donald Trump of the West Coast" until Mr. Trump's recent
financial problems. Irvine owns one-sixth of booming Orange
County, south of Los Angeles. Its holdings include
undeveloped land, sprawling industrial parks, luxury retail
centers and upscale apartment units.
   Mrs. Smith and her mother, Athalie Clarke, launched the
litigation nearly seven years ago by asking a Michigan state
court to determine the "fair value" of their stake. Irvine is
incorporated in Michigan. A 155-day trial ended in December
1988 and was followed by 1,500 pages of post-trial briefs.
The case was submitted to the referee a year ago.
   Gary H. Hunt, an Irvine senior vice president, said the
company is very pleased with the decision. "The bottom line
is that Mrs. Smith and her mother will receive only modestly
more than {they} would have received on the day the merger
was approved in 1983, an amount, $34 million, that is
approximately the cost to both parties of litigating this for
the past seven years."
   Howard I. Friedman, a Los Angeles attorney representing
Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Clarke, said he didn't know yet if the
decision would be appealed.
   "We're somewhat disappointed," he acknowledged. "It's
considerably less than what we believe the company is worth."
Mr. Friedman said his clients would receive interest in
addition to the 30% improvement over Mr. Bren's offer of
$208,400 for each of their 550 shares.
   Irvine, based in Newport Beach, Calif., had argued that it
was unlikely that some of the nation's most astute investors
and business people, who were among the 33 selling
shareholders, would have accepted a low offer. The sellers
included Albert Taubman, a shopping center developer, Herbert
Allen, a Wall Street investment banker, and Henry Ford II, an
heir of the auto making family.
   Irvine Co. was originally an enormous ranch pieced
together from Spanish land grants by James Irvine and his
partners. His great-granddaughter, Mrs. Smith, inherited her
shares in the early 1950s. She is the last Irvine family
member to own a large block of stock.
