   NEW MILFORD, N.J. -- Polifly Financial Corp., holding
company for Polifly Savings &amp; Loan Association, named
42-year-old Joseph S. Paparatto president, chief executive
officer and a director.
   Mr. Paparatto succeeds Gregg B. Van Dam, who resigned the
positions in March under a consent agreement that the thrift
signed with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision. The
company was found out of compliance with the requirements of
the thrift-reform law Congress passed in August.
