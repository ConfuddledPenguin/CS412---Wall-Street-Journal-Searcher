   PPG Industries Inc., a Pittsburgh-based maker of glass,
chemicals and coatings, said it will enter into a joint
venture with C. Itoh &amp; Co., a Japanese trading house, to sell
and distribute PPG's flat glass products in Japan.
   PPG will own 51% of the new company, PPG-CI Co. of Tokyo.
It wouldn't disclose the size of the project, which is
intended to benefit from growing demand for glass by Japan's
construction and auto industries.
