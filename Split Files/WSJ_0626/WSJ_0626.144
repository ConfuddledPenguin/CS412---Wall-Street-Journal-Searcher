   DSC Communications Corp. said it and other defendants
preliminarily agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by
paying plaintiffs about $30 million.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Dallas in 1985,
alleged that DSC; several top officers; the company's
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen & Co.; and its investment
bank, Allen &amp; Co., among others, defrauded shareholders by
publishing inflated financial statements during certain
periods in 1984 and 1985.

   Officials of Arthur Andersen and Allen &amp; Co. couldn't be
reached for comment.
   DSC, a maker of telephone switching and transmission
equipment, subsequently changed its revenue accounting
procedures and restated the figures from those periods.
   The company said its share of the proposed settlement is
about $9 million, while the company's insurance carrier and
other defendants will pay the remainder. It said the
settlement won't materially affect its financial position.
   Under the settlement, which remains to be ratified by a
judge, the claims against the company and the individual
defendants will be dismissed without any admission or
presumption of liability by the defendants, DSC said.
