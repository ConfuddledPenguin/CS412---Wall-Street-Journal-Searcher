   AMSTERDAM -- Dutch retail sales in April increased a
provisional 6% from the year before, the Dutch Central Bureau
of Statistics reported.
   The 6% gain doesn't take into account increases caused by
inflation, which pushed prices 2.2% higher in April, compared
with April 1989.

   The strong rise in retail sales occurred despite the fact
that the long Easter weekend fell in April this year and in
March last year, the government said.
   Department store sales, however, fell 4.1%.
   The strongest growth came in the food sector, where sales
rose 7.7% from a year earlier. Sales in the non-food sector
advanced just 5.5%, but sales of household articles jumped
18.5%. Sales of flowers and plants rose 12.7% and drugstore
sales increased 10.7%.
   In the food sector, sales of meat were up 5.1%, sales of
groceries added 5.8% and sales of milk and dairy products
climbed 5.3%, the statistics bureau reported.
