   VANCOUVER, Wash. -- Jolene Unsoeld is a slender woman with
steel-cable strength. She confronts life as she would
confront a mountain, as a challenge to be surmounted.
   Fifty-eight years old and a first-term Democratic
congresswoman now, she was already climbing mountains as a
teen-ager. She became the first woman to scale Wyoming's
Grand Teton by a direct ascent of its north face. But in
mountains she found tragedy. She's confronting that, too.

   Family photographs, so personal you have the uneasy
feeling you've intruded into a living room, line her campaign
headquarters here. There is her daughter Devi climbing her
namesake mountain, India's Nanda Devi. Devi died on that
mountain, in her father's arms. There is her husband, Willi
-- the legend who climbed Mount Everest by its stark and
stunning West Ridge, the philosopher who searched for meaning
above 10,000 feet. In 1979, three years after Devi's death,
Willi was killed by an avalanche.
   "I've grown so much tougher since then," the congresswoman
says softly. The gray-haired grandmother will need all the
toughness she can muster. For Rep. Unsoeld is climbing a
different kind of mountain now.
   She may well be the most-endangered Democratic incumbent
in the House. Two years ago, surviving the nation's closest
House race, she squeaked into office by only 618 votes. Now
she's a top-priority Republican target. An environmentalist,
she's caught in the cross fire of the Pacific Northwest's
raging timber war, which pits logging jobs against preserving
old-growth forest and the endangered northern spotted owl.
It's a no-win issue.
   "Things are getting better," she wryly tells a rally here,
recounting the day she joined a parade of angry loggers.
"There was only one logger who said, `If I had a gun I'd
shoot you.'"
   Her southwest Washington district, a region of prime
timberland between the Pacific Coast and the high Cascades,
is traditionally Democratic. But the timber issue alienates
normally Democratic voters, and Rep. Unsoeld's GOP opponent,
former state legislator Bob Williams, has a proven knack for
winning Democratic votes. A conservative, Mr. Williams is
attacking her as an environmental "extremist" who "clearly
has never been on the side of the workingman."
   This race is a barometer of the volatile
environment-vs.-logging issue that's roiling politics
throughout Washington, Oregon and California this year. But
what gives the race a dimension beyond politics is the
personal drama of the woman herself.
   She's a self-described "meddler" in government, determined
to remain so. In 1971, she became a self-appointed watchdog,
tracking the influence of special-interest money in state
politics. The title of a study she published stripped the
political process to a stark core: "Who Gave? Who Got? How
Much?" She'd pore over campaign-contribution disclosures
until five in the morning, then find herself too keyed up to
sleep. The effort, she says, "came close to breaking my
health." Elected to the legislature in 1984, she championed
openness in government and tougher regulations for
toxic-waste disposal.
   In her quiet but relentless way, she is as driven as her
late husband. Willi Unsoeld, who climbed Mount Everest in
1963, believed that "life begins at 10,000 feet." He spent
his life searching for spiritual wholeness -- "closeness with
the ice, brotherhood with the rock," he once put it -- in the
wind and swirling snow beneath summit after summit.
   As a young man, Willi Unsoeld was enchanted by the sheer
loveliness of Nanda Devi, India's highest peak. As he told
and retold the story, he decided then and there it was time
to find a wife, father a daughter and name her for the
mountain. He and Jolene announced their engagement to friends
atop Mount St. Helens. They had four children, two boys and
two girls. In 1976, Willi took his daughter Devi to climb her
mountain.
   It all went terribly wrong.
   The expedition had pushed above 23,000 feet when Devi was
stricken with acute abdominal pains. The pains continued
throughout the night. In the early morning, Willi and others
in the group prepared to get her to lower altitude. Almost
matter-of-factly, Devi said: "I'm going to die." She pitched
forward and was gone. Jolene got the telegram: ". . . Body
committed to the mountain." It was like a burial at sea.
   Three years later, death claimed Willi. An
outdoor-education teacher by then, he led a party of college
students on a winter climb of Mount Rainier. A savage storm
caught the group as it descended; an avalanche killed both
Willi and a student with him.
   "They say it takes a year" to recover from tragedy, Rep.
Unsoeld says. "It takes longer than that."
   She dates her own healing to a wave of utter certainty
that swept over her one day while, of all things, she was
doing the vacuuming. "I hate doing the vacuuming]" she says.
"But I was suddenly aware that {the tragedy} was not a total
loss . . . but rather that all the things my husband and I
had done, separately and together, had coalesced. It could go
on with me."
   So now she campaigns for re-election, a woman far more
comfortable with talking public policy than with asking for
the public's votes. Driving down the interstate, talking
legislation, she becomes so animated that both hands fly off
the steering wheel. The car cruises on, as if on automatic
pilot. But later, after asking for help at a rally, she
admits to the crowd: "You don't know how hard that is to say.
Because I am a very independent cuss."
   Too independent, argues Republican opponent Bob Williams,
who calls Rep. Unsoeld far beyond the mainstream of the
district. "If she were representing Hollywood, it wouldn't be
so bad," he says. "Even within her party she's considered
extremely liberal." Republican big guns have flown into the
Northwest to reinforce his campaign -- among them President
Bush, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan.
   Overshadowing all else is the jobs-vs.-environment issue.
No one can say with certainty how many jobs are threatened by
the federal decision to save the spotted owl and the
old-growth forests in which it lives. But fear and anger are
in the air -- a Williams radio spot predicts a loss of as
many as 40,000 jobs -- and even Unsoeld supporters concede
the issue can only hurt her.
   "Loggers are going to be mad at somebody, and I think
they're going to be mad at incumbents," says Joe King, the
Democratic speaker of the Washington House. Yet Mr. King
draws encouragement from a campaign incident last May.
   Picketing loggers blocked the congresswoman's entrance to
an indoor event. So for three hours the petite congresswoman
stayed outside in a chill wind, listening to burly loggers.
After most had drifted away, she climbed inside the truck cab
of some latecomers and listened some more.
   "I think Jolene will win on character," ventures Mr. King.
"Jeez, that woman has guts."
