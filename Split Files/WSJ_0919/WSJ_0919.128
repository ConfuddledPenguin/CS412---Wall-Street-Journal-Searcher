   TJ International said it is buying back $15 million of
stock and will issue $15 million of non-marketable,
convertible voting preferred stock to its employee stock
ownership plan, or ESOP.
   The $15 million buy-back program will purchase TJ
International common stock on the open market. Leveraging the
ESOP will allow it to buy shares of newly issued convertible
preferred with a minimum liquidation value of 135% of the
common stock's value. This will boost the ESOP's stake in the
Boise, Idaho, building products company to 14% from about 6%.

   "We believe it is a timely time to buy back our stock,
given that the stock is at a very low price," Walt Wadman,
TJ's vice president, finance, said. TJ's stock has fallen
from a high of $36 only a year ago to as low as $15 more
recently. It closed yesterday at $17.75, up $1.125, in
national over-the-counter trading.
