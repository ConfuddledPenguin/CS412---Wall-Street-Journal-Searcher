   The decade of downsizing has triggered another legacy:
revenge. A growing number of employees are retaliating (or
fantasizing about it) for past or perceived wrongs. They are
taking it out on colleagues, bosses or their companies in
general.
   That's the disquieting report from management consultants,
psychologists and managers. They acknowledge that the
dog-eat-dog world of corporate and office politics has always
sparked acts of retribution. But they say things are getting
out of hand. And while revenge may be sweet, it can also be
devastating, especially when careers and reputations are at
stake.

   People look to exact revenge when they believe they have
been slighted and feel the need to repair the perceived
damage done to them, says Ronald S. Ebert, a psychologist at
the Levinson Institute in Belmont, Mass. "While to an
objective observer, the slight may appear to be of small
consequence, to the individual who feels harmed, it's
significant."
   Mr. Ebert notes that with increased anxiety over job
security present in the workplace, he has found himself
counseling more and more employees experiencing difficulties
in coping with their work situations.
   "Business is all too good for me," the psychologist says.
"It's a change from recent years," he adds, warning that the
workplace is well on the way to becoming a breeding ground
for vengeful acts.
   Revenge takes many forms, from the subtle to the shocking.
Mr. Ebert cites one of his patients who, demoted to a menial
job after years with a Boston-area high-tech company, was
found with a loaded gun in the company parking lot. He blamed
his supervisor for the demotion and was waiting for the
supervisor to arrive at work to retaliate violently.
   A longtime Walt Disney Co. employee used far subtler
tactics to get even after she was passed over for a promotion
she felt she deserved. Knowing that her new boss faced
pressure to vastly improve the work he supervised, the woman
began taking much longer than usual to complete projects.
When he wrote a negative job evaluation, without even talking
to her, and placed it in her employment file, she responded
with a lengthy memo -- and sent copies to the division's top
brass. She also made nasty comments about his actions to a
few colleagues behind his back.
   "This was vengeful, and I did it purposely," she admits.
"But I felt totally justified. I knew it would really hurt my
boss and destroy his credibility." And it did. "All hell
broke loose," she recounts. Within months her boss was fired
-- and she got his job. (That explains why she demands
anonymity.)
   And there is the executive recruiter who, apparently still
angry at his former big bank employer for assigning him to an
undesirable location after he turned down a foreign
assignment, never loses an opportunity to raid that bank in
his headhunting forays.
   Middle managers aren't the only ones looking to get even.
Note the flood of tell-all books that have come out of the
executive suite and corporate board room in recent years.
Company bigwigs who aren't all that concerned about the
consequences have been known to use these books to take
potshots at former colleagues and get back at business
rivals. The books often contain juicy tidbits that weren't
all that well known before their exposure on the printed
page.
   Al Neuharth, former chief executive officer at Gannett
Co., admits in his autobiography, "Confessions of an S.O.B.,"
to having had a hand in unseating his boss at Gannett and in
undermining a company executive. All, it seems, for the sake
of getting even and getting ahead.
   Judith Briles, author of "Woman to Woman: From Sabotage to
Support," points in her book to the head of a West Coast
public relations and advertising agency whose reputation was
nearly ruined by a vengeful employee. The employee had been
threatened with firing because she didn't produce and had
been accused of telling clients she was planning to start her
own firm.
   When the Internal Revenue Service was investigating the
company for mistakes it made in an annual audit, the angry
employee used the occasion to plant rumors with the local
media about alleged financial improprieties by the boss. The
negative publicity almost did the firm in. Later, some
newspapers ran retractions of stories they had printed. But
by then, the firm had already lost a number of its clients,
and the boss had spent $30,000 in tax attorneys' fees to
clear herself, Ms. Briles says.
   The streamlining binge that felled millions of managers
and employers over the past decade also took its toll on
corporate loyalty. And that has spurred getting even. "No
matter how you describe it -- reduction in the work force,
retrenchment or downsizing" -- an executive who loses his or
her job can't help but feel "bitter, defeated, and angry,"
says Arnold Menn, an Austin, Texas, outplacement consultant.
   A casualty of McGraw-Hill Inc.'s cutback last December,
which eliminated over 1,000 people, says she can't lose the
feeling of betrayal toward her former employer, even though
she has landed on her feet. She says she has been tempted to
bad-mouth the publishing concern and tip competitors to
company secrets.
   "When you're associated with a company, you want to hear
good things about it," she says. "But when you're no longer
associated with it, who cares? When I hear the name
McGraw-Hill, I associate it with bad feelings and get these
nasty emotions. It's a simple step to go beyond that and say
something nasty." She adds, "It was more than just a job; it
was a family. So it was worse than if I never cared about the
job to begin with."
   Short of changing the locks -- which is what one New York
consulting firm does every time it lays someone off -- what
can managers do to protect themselves and their employers
against possible retaliation from a worker out to get even?
   First, they must realize that "revenge comes of intense
frustration," says Nella G. Barkley, president of
Crystal-Barkley Corp., a New York-based career-consulting and
training concern. "If you find yourself dealing with the same
troublesome issue over and over again, you can bet something
is wrong."
   Ms. Barkley advises managers to identify the person in the
office who acts as a sounding board for others, who hears all
the gripes, no matter how petty. This person, she says, can
be a valuable conduit of information without becoming a
snitch.
   Ms. Briles, in her book, offers several telltale signs
that often give away a vengeful employee. Be alert, she says,
for an employee who gossips, lies, takes credit for the work
of others, organizes groups that exclude people, withholds
information, or misdirects memos or phone calls.
   Mr. Ebert, the psychologist, urges managers to be
attentive to their associates. "Managers aren't therapists
and shouldn't try to be," he says. But the more that work
procedures are shared and employees involved, he maintains,
the less likely it is that employees will feel frustrated,
angry, rejected -- and want revenge.
