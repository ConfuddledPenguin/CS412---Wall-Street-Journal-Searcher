   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Judiciary Committee approved
a plan under which makers of computer software could bar
video stores and others from renting them to customers.
Manufacturers have complained that video game rentals cut
into sales.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar (D., Okla.), is
similar to a law under which record makers are allowed to bar
rentals. The software measure sailed through the Committee by
a voice vote, despite objections from video rental store
operators.

   Sponsors are expected to push for early action on the
measure. The Senate already has passed similar legislation.
   The idea behind the bill is that it is easy to copy both
records and computer software stored on floppy disks. Rentals
thus are considered to undercut copyrights held by
manufacturers. Games often are priced from $40 to $50. Under
the bill, manufacturers could allow rentals or bar them. In
the case of records, most makers don't allow rentals.
   The bill applies to a wide range of computer software, in
addition to video games, but rentals of games by stores that
specialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of the
issue.
