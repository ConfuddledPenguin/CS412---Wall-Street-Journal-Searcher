   AMSTERDAM -- Dutch retail sales rose 6.6% in July over the
year-earlier period, according to the Dutch Central Bureau of
Statistics.
   Although July's sales were up substantially, the rise was
not as sharp as that registered in June, when retail sales
were up 7.6% over the year-earlier month.

   The increase in July retail sales was led by the non-food
sector, where sales were 9.8% higher than in July 1989.
Food-sector sales increased 3.7% over July 1989.
