   National Intergroup Inc. said it is considering extending
its tender offer for all outstanding cumulative convertible
preference units of Permian Partners L.P.
   If the offer is extended beyond Oct. 1, the wholesale and
drug distributor, based in Pittsburgh, will reduce the cash
portion of its purchase price to $3.5625 from $3.85 per
preference unit of Permian, an oil concern.

   The offer may be extended because certain terms of the
offer have not been satisfied, National Intergroup said.
