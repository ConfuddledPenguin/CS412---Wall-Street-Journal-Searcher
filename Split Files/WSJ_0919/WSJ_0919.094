   CHICAGO -- Prices of soybean contracts rebounded amid
jitters about the chances of a Midwest frost by next week.
   The soybean and corn crops are vulnerable to frost damage
because the unusually wet summer slowed their rate of
maturity.

   Soybean prices reacted the most strongly of major Midwest
crops yesterday in part because a weekly government survey of
growing conditions showed that the soybean crop didn't
improve as expected in Minnesota, Nebraska and Missouri.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean
contract for September delivery rose seven cents a bushel to
settle at $6.225 a bushel.
   On Monday, soybean prices had dropped in the wake of signs
that the White House won't offer any special trade credits
soon to the Soviet Union, one of the biggest buyers of U.S.
crops.
   U.S. traders had been speculating that reports of bread
shortages in the Soviet Union might help unlock U.S. credits.
But the Bush administration wants the Soviet Union to first
clear away any hurdles that block emigration by its Jewish
citizens.
   The new frost forecast also helped to slightly raise
prices of several corn futures contracts.
   In a typical year, most crops have stopped developing on
their own accord in time for a killing frost. This year,
however, only 33% of the corn crop is mature, compared with a
normal rate of 61%, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.
   Only 22% of the soybean crop has matured, compared with a
normal rate of 39% by this time of the season, Mr. Lespinasse
said.
   The rally was triggered by forecasts for cool and wet
weather in much of the Midwest through this weekend. Such a
weather pattern would continue to slow the harvest while
increasing the chances of a frost.
   Some forecasters are predicting a chance for a frost by
Monday in northern sections of southern Minnesota, Iowa,
Illinois and Indiana.
   Most analysts expect soybean prices to be choppy until the
harvest is completed. After the harvest, traders will begin
to focus on the prospects for the planting of soybeans in
South America.
   According to Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain &amp;
Livestock Corp., Chicago, soybean acreage may slip in South
America because budget pressures are forcing governments to
trim funds to farmers. At the same time, farm expenses are
increasing in the wake of the jump in oil prices, he said.
   Wheat prices fell yesterday.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: With no additional war talk out of the Middle East
or Washington, crude oil futures prices couldn't sustain
Monday's record-breaking gains, falling 22 cents a barrel in
New York Mercantile Exchange trading. Crude for October
delivery fell to $33.41 a barrel on the heels of similar
declines in Europe. The October contract, which expires with
tomorrow's trading, was the only crude contract showing a
decline on the New York Merc. However, October and November
gasoline registered a slight decline, as well. Traders have
expressed some surprise at the recent relative sluggishness
in gasoline futures prices.
   Perhaps some of that surprise will dissipate when traders
digest the latest weekly report on U.S. petroleum inventories
released by the American Petroleum Institute after trading
stopped yesterday. It showed a huge 5,870,000 barrel buildup
in gasoline stocks for the week ended Friday. Traders and
analysts surveyed earlier by AP-Dow Jones said they thought
gasoline inventories fell by 750,000 barrels that week.
   Similarly, survey participants were substantially off in
their crude inventory estimates. The API report put U.S.
crude stocks at nearly 369.8 million barrels, a decrease of
4.5 million barrels. The AP-Dow Jones report said market
players expected a drop of 2.1 million barrels.
   Only on heating oil was the survey's projection of a
1,750,000-barrel increase about on target with the API's 1.6
million barrel rise. Heating oil futures have exhibited
strength in recent sessions that traders attribute to spread
trading and firmer European prices. Yesterday, October
heating oil ended at 86.43 cents a gallon, up 1.12 cents.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were sharply lower despite a
partial recovery from an early plunge that was triggered by
weakness in London. The December contract ended with a loss
of 3.75 cents a pound at $1.24, just under the day's high of
$1.2450. The December contract dropped six cents a pound in
early trading to $1.2170, as traders reacted in sympathy with
London, said John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &amp;
Associates, copper industry consultants in New City, N.Y.
"There has been growing concern in London that there might
not be enough copper to satisfy deliveries against the cash
contract on the London Metal Exchange by Thursday, which is
the day on which the contract matures," Mr. Gross said. As a
result, he said, traders who had previously sold short in
anticipation that prices would go down began buying back
contracts to liquidate their positions. As a result, he
noted, "the spread, or the difference between the cash
position and three months {delivery} on Monday widened to the
equivalent of 20 cents a pound." Yesterday, the urgency to
buy contracts by traders who previously sold short ran its
course and the spread between the cash and three months
deliveries narrowed to nine cents a pound as the price of the
cash contract fell sharply, according to Mr. Gross.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices declined. The October contract ended
with a loss of 0.23 cent a pound at 10.92 cents, after
rebounding from a drop to 10.75 cents, which was the day's
low and 0.40 cent below Monday's close. Traders in recent
sessions have been liquidating October contracts prior to the
expiration of the contract on Sept. 28, an analyst said.
Yesterday, after trading quietly most of the day, selling
developed in the contract; the price decline was accelerated
by the thin market, the analyst said. Additional selling
appeared as the December price fell below 11 cents, 10.90
cents and 10.80 cents, regarded as chief resistance levels,
until it fell to its low and steadied. Traders ignored a
report by the International Sugar Organization that estimated
there would be a surplus of 559,000 metric tons of sugar at
the end of the current season on Aug. 31, 1991. Because that
projection was well below the forecast of a major London
trade firm, which last week estimated the surplus at 1.4
million tons, it normally would have been a price-firming
factor, a New York dealer said. "People apparently aren't
paying attention to fundamentals at this moment," the dealer
said.
