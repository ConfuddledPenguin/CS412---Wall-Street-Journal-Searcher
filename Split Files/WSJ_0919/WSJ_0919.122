   GAF Corp. said it concluded a long-term financing
agreement with Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of New York, Bank
of Nova Scotia and Banque Paribas for $800 million.
   The new credit includes an eight-year, $600 million term
loan and a five-year revolving credit; with the funds, the
company will repay debt incurred at the time of its March
1989 acquisition by a management group led by Samuel J.
Heyman, chairman and chief executive officer.

notes, due March 15, 1994, outstanding. GAF still has about
$236 million of subordinated merger-related debentures due in
2005 outstanding.
   GAF is a Wayne, N.J., manufacturer of specialty chemicals
and building materials.
