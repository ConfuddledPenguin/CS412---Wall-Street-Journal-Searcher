   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose despite U.S. reports of a
yawning trade gap and quickening inflation.
   Though the dollar was sold after the announcements of the
bleak U.S. data, the selling stalled before the dollar
touched a recent low against the mark. Technicians reasserted
control and halted the decline. Then, other traders stepped
in to square their short, or oversold, dollar positions and
boosted the U.S. currency even more.

   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5530 marks, up from 1.5480 marks late Monday in New York.
   The U.S. currency climbed to 137.85 yen, up from 136.55
yen. It also rose to 1.2905 Swiss francs from 1.2765 francs.
Sterling was unchanged at $1.9140.
   "There was just not enough bad news to push the dollar
down," said Donald Hubbard, a Midland Bank treasury officer
in New York.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 138.45 yen, up from 137.68 yen at the close there Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5525
marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5560 marks.
   Also supporting the dollar yesterday were slight declines
in Swiss and Belgian benchmark interest rates, said Walter
Simon, a New York dealer with Bank Julius Baer. Complementing
looser money trends in France and Italy, the Swiss National
Bank's market-set Lombard rate eased to 9% from 9.375%
Monday, while the Belgian National Bank shaved its
three-month Treasury bill rate to 9% from 9.05%.
   Some analysts have suggested that the Bundesbank is
encouraging credit relaxation by nations neighboring Germany,
in an attempt to support the mark without raising its own
rates. Mr. Simon, however, said the moves probably have more
to do with domestic considerations in those countries.
   The U.S. currency hit bottom at 1.5420 marks about an hour
and a half after the economic numbers were released. That was
well short of its record low of 1.5385 marks, set on Aug. 27,
and just below the 1.5440-mark point that signals a buying
opportunity to some technicians.
   The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade
deficit widened in July to $9.33 billion from a revised $5.34
billion in June. The shortfall was much worse than the $7.6
billion expected.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the nation's consumer
price index rose 0.8% in August, or at a 9.6% annual rate.
The leap, which was twice the size of the July increase, had
been expected because the report was the first to reflect the
rise in crude-oil prices since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   However, the so-called core rate of inflation, excluding
food and energy, jumped 0.5%, showing the gas pump isn't the
only source of price pressure.
   For the U.S. economy, the reports were pure bad news. For
the dollar, however, they were mixed.
   For example, the inflation pace may restrain the Federal
Reserve from easing credit, even if negotiators produce a
budget deficit reduction pact that is considered credible.
And lower interest rates would discourage foreigners from
buying dollars.
   As currency movements showed, "we still haven't seen
enough of what is going on in the U.S. economy to make big
bets on the dollar," said Lisa Finstrom, an analyst at Lehman
Brothers. That may have to wait for the September employment
numbers in early October, she said.
   The yen was among the day's biggest losers. The Japanese
currency was hurt by profit-taking from its recent run-up, as
well as surging oil prices and a second day of declines on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Index shed 480.78 points
Tuesday after losing 531.86 points Monday.
   Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan officials tried to
talk the home currency higher Tuesday by calling the yen's
recent gains "welcome" -- but to little effect.
   Meanwhile, the dollar ended European dealings mostly
weaker. Dealers said that the dollar remains under pressure
from economic fundamentals but added that yesterday's U.S.
economic reports weren't bad enough to push the currency
below recent record lows.
   The dollar finished Asian trading higher on covering of
short dollar positions. The U.S. currency was last quoted in
Tokyo Tuesday at 137.68 yen, above 137 yen late Monday.
Traders also said Japanese life insurance companies bought
dollars when the currency was at the 137.50 yen level.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $387.60 an ounce, down $1.80. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $387.95 an ounce.
