   GOLDEN, Colo. -- Adolph Coors Co. said its Keystone and
Keystone Light brands sold more than 2.3 million barrels in
their first year, surpassing the initial sales of many other
recently introduced beers.
   The so-called popular-priced brand was Coors's first
venture into the lower-priced beer market and one of the few
new product introductions from the company. "I think you'll
find Coors will be aggressive in the new product area in the
future," said Craig Guthrie, brand director at Coors.

   Among other successful brands which have been introduced
recently, Miller Brewing Co.'s Miller Genuine Draft sold 2.2
million barrels in its initial year, while Anheuser-Busch
Cos.' Michelob Dry sold 1.7 million in its first year. Miller
Brewing is a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos.
   Mr. Guthrie said the success of Keystone, which was
introduced without test marketing, was due in part to
effective advertising and to timing in the beer market. "We
could have introduced this beer three years ago and our
results wouldn't have been quite as good," he said. "The fact
that (Stroh Brewery Co. and G. Heileman Brewing Co.) are
having problems certainly helped a lot."
