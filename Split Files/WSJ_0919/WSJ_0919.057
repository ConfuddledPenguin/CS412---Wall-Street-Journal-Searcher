   These are edited excerpts from two recent legal opinions
involving savings and loans that have been seized by
government regulators (see related story: "At Lincoln
Savings: Skullduggery" -- WSJ Sept. 19, 1990). In one case,
the judge found that the seizure was an abuse of power. In
the other, the judge decided the regulators got it right. A
related editorial appears today {see related editorial --
"REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Sheep and Goats" -- WSJ Sept
19, 1990}.

   From the opinion of Judge Dale Saffels in Franklin Savings
v. Office of Thrift Supervision:
                                                                                                       

   As in an initial matter, the court wishes to comment that
this is not a case involving an infamous or notorious savings
and loan association, the likes of which the public has
recently become more than familiar. This is not a case
involving fraud, corruption, or self-dealing by the
management or directors of Franklin. There has been no
allegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct by
Franklin's management or directors. Essentially, this case
boils down to a dispute over accounting practices.
   {From footnote one; see below for extracts from the
Lincoln case.} The court has reviewed defendant's recent
submission of additional authority, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
The court finds this authority of little value or guidance to
the present case. The facts established in Lincoln show clear
justification for the regulator's actions. Here, unlike in
Lincoln, the directors and management of Franklin have not
abused their position and have not been looting the
institution. Each case must be resolved on its own factual
situation.
                                                                                                       

   General Background
                                                                                                       

   Ernest F. Fleischer served as chairman of the board of
Franklin Savings Association until the appointment of
conservator on February 16, 1990. Franklin discovered that it
had economic losses in place that ranged from $40-60 million.
To address these losses, Franklin retained Dr. Wayne Angell,
then a professor of economics and finance at Ottawa
University in Ottawa, Kansas. Dr. Angell was retained to
determine whether Franklin could earn back the losses already
in place and continue to operate as a profitable business.
   In 1981 Dr. Angell determined that Franklin could earn a
safe profit on the purchase of Government National Mortgage
Association ("GNMA") mortgage backed securities ("MBS"). Dr.
Angell's analysis indicated that these securities could be
purchased at a value that far exceeded the cost of funds to
carry those assets.
   Franklin initially used Smith, Breeden's services to hedge
the maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. In
this hedging program if interest rates increased, Franklin
would experience gains from its positions in the futures
market which would be used to offset its increased cost for
funding deposit liabilities at a new higher rate of interest.
Conversely, if interest rates declined, the losses suffered
in the futures market would be offset by the gains from the
repricing of the liabilities.
   In late 1986, Franklin began the search to hire an
individual to lead and develop a research division, in house,
at Franklin. The research division was to replace the
services that had been provided by Smith, Breeden. In the
fall of 1987, John Scowcroft began working at Franklin. Mr.
Scowcroft had formerly been the head of the research
department at Merrill Lynch.
   Mr. Scowcroft successfully assembled a highly skilled and
talented cadre of professionals in Franklin's newly created
research department. This department was comprised of
individuals having Ph.D.s in finance and economics and
M.B.A.s, and having practical experience at many of the top
finance and brokerage firms in the nation. These individuals
included Massoud Heidari, who had a Ph.D. from MIT in
engineering and who had previously worked at First Boston;
Steve Hotopp, who had a Ph.D. from the University of
Illinois; and Dick Kazarian, who had a M.B.A. from the
University of Chicago and who had worked at Drexel. All these
individuals worked on developing Franklin's computer models.
Franklin also recruited Liz Kearns, M.B.S. Farleigh Dickinson
University, who had worked at Merrill Lynch and Standard and
Poor. Ms. Kearns was hired to work with liability management.
Ramine Rouhani, Ph.D. from Stanford in engineering and
economics, had worked at Goldman Sachs and CitiCorp, and was
hired by Franklin to work with management, hedge analysis and
interest rate models. Furthermore, Franklin was successful in
recruiting Michael Smirlock, Ph.D. from Washington
University, who had been a tenured professor at the Wharton
School of Business. Smirlock was in charge of Franklin's
asset acquisitions. Also, Franklin hired William Marshall,
Ph.D. from Washington University. Mr. Marshall previously had
been co-manager of Goldman Sachs's financial strategies
group.
                                                                                                       

   The Regulatory Examination
                                                                                                       

   In late 1988 some members of the FHLBB-Topeka staff were
highly criticized for their handling of Silverado Savings &amp;
Loan, a Colorado thrift, and were informed by Chairman M.
Danny Wall that their jobs were in jeopardy if their
performance did not improve. Some of these same individuals
were later involved in the October 1989 Franklin examination.
   The analyst in charge of Silverado, Thomas O'Rourke, was
assigned to work full time on the Franklin examination and
matters relating to Franklin beginning July 1, 1989.
   Mr. O'Rourke noted that Franklin had in its portfolio
similar assets to those formerly held by Silverado. This
similarity probably slanted Mr. O'Rourke's view against
Franklin and Franklin's system of operations.
   Mr. O'Rourke reviewed and read Franklin's Form 10K (annual
report) for the period ended June 30, 1989. Mr. O'Rourke had
previously read only one form 10K and was unaware of the
disclosures required in such a document. O'Rourke
misperceived the cautionary disclosures of "Material adverse
risk" in the form 10K as projections that the institution
would experience difficulties. However, Franklin made these
disclosures to fulfill its duty under federal securities
laws. Such disclosures were included in earlier 10Ks filed by
Franklin. After reviewing the Form 10K, Mr. O'Rourke drafted
a memorandum changing Franklin's internal OTS {Office of
Thrift Supervision} classification from "healthy" to
"marginal."
   The disclosures presented in Franklin's 10K for the period
ended June 30, 1989, were proper. The conclusions O'Rourke
and OTS reached after reviewing the 10K, that the risks
disclosed were likely or probable to occur, were arbitrary
and capricious and without reasonable basis.
   Members of the OTS-Topeka staff appeared to lack adequate
training and understanding to evaluate the nature of
Franklin's operation. The written analyses and memoranda
prepared by the Topeka staff, including portions of
Franklin's report of examination, Mr. O'Rourke's review of
Franklin's Form 10K, and the recommendation memo dated
February 12, 1989 contained fundamental factual errors as
well as material errors of interpretation and analysis.
   The recommendation memo, or "Smemo," went through several
drafts before the final form was executed. The draft
preceding the final version was changed, on specific advice
and instruction of OTS-Topeka district counsel, Brian
McCormally. McCormally indicated that it was necessary to
"point the finger" at Franklin's management. No factual or
legal basis exists for McCormally's instruction. This action
is indicative of arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable
conduct.
   February 15, 1990, Mr. Fleischer informed Thomas O'Rourke
of the conversation with IBJ Schroder, and that the bond
trustee was of the view that the Form 10Q did not constitute
an event triggering default and also of the possibility of a
bond exchange. Mr. O'Rourke was instructed by OTS district
counsel McCormally not to follow-up on this information.
   At the February 16, 1990, board of directors meeting, OTS
district counsel Brian McCormally informed Franklin that
OTS's outside counsel had provided an opinion that the Form
10Q as published and the report of examination constituted an
event of default allowing the bond trustee to being
collateral substitution or legal defeasance. This was
erroneous.
   Following the OTS's February 20, 1990, directive
concerning the hedge accounting and credit enhancement
write-downs, Franklin nonetheless had the means to comply
with all regulatory capital requirements through transactions
already scheduled to occur.
   On March 8, 1990, OTS was informed by facsimile
transmission that Franklin had available the means to meet
regulatory capital requirements, even if the hedge accounting
and credit enhancement write-downs were valid and that RTC
was preparing to announce publicly that Franklin was a
solvent institution. On the following day, March 9, 1990, OTS
imposed a second wave of adjustments consisting of an
additional $61.9 million (later corrected to $51.9 million)
"safety and soundness" hedge accounting write-down and a
write-down of $110 million relating to the tax agreements
entered into between Franklin and FSC. The court finds that
this second wave of adjustments imposed on March 9, 1990, was
arbitrary and capricious and lacked any reasonable basis.
                                                                                                       

   OTS's Directed Write-downs for Deferred Hedging Losses
                                                                                                       

   The hedge accounting issue in this case boils down to
whether Franklin's policy and procedures for ascertaining the
existence of high correlation and substantial offset in past
periods on an ongoing basis are appropriate implementation of
the general guidelines of FAS 80, in accordance with GAAP.
   Based on the evidence presented, this court is convinced
and finds that the hedge accounting policies dated June 30,
1988, and December 31, 1988, are consistent in all material
effects and are in accordance with GAAP.
   The expert opinion evidence presented in this case clearly
convinces the court that the challenged provisions of the
Franklin's correlation policy are safe and sound practices.
OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and without
reasonable basis in directing this second wave of write-downs
relating to the hedge accounting policy.
   Franklin's hedging program has not caused any economic
losses to the institution.
   There exists no relationship between the accounting gains
on sales of assets and the amount of Franklin's deferred
hedging losses. The court finds OTS's unsupported assertions
to the contrary to be without reasonable basis.
   Franklin was not dependent on gains from the sales of
assets to conduct profitable operations. For each year from
June 30, 1983, through December 31, 1989, Franklin had net
income after taxes, with gains and losses from sale of assets
and discontinued operations excluded.
                                                                                                       

   OTS's Write-downs Regarding Bond Defeasance
                                                                                                       

   OTS directed an additional $185 million reduction in
Franklin's capital to account for the bond defeasance of the
$2.9 million zero coupon bond issuance made in 1984. OTS
concluded that after the reductions were made for the other
write-downs, Franklin would fail to meet its core and
tangible capital requirements. OTS considered that this
failure of capital requirements would likely trigger the bond
defeasance/collateral substitution provision of the bond
indenture. Bond defeasance or collateral substitution would
result in a realization of $185 million reduction in
Franklin's capital. Therefore, OTS ordered this additional
write-down in capital.
   The court believes that the OTS improperly relied on the
bond issue in reaction to its failure to act promptly with
respect to similar zero coupon bonds issued by CenTrust
Savings Bank of Miami, Florida. OTS wanted to avoid
embarrassment, such as that caused by its failure to promptly
act and to prevent a loss on the CenTrust bonds. Franklin,
however, was not in the same position as CenTrust with regard
to zero coupon bonds. Franklin had never reported capital
failure as had CenTrust. OTS's attempt to draw a parallel
between Franklin's case and CenTrust's case was improper. An
OTS internal memo even indicates that the regulator knew that
Franklin was not in the same situation as CenTrust. (Exhibit
827, "Well, it ain't CenTrust, but it's all we got.") OTS's
action regarding the directed write-down for bond defeasance
was arbitrary and capricious and without reasonable basis in
law or fact.
                                                                                                       

   Charges of Biased or Prejudiced Action by OTS
                                                                                                       

   Franklin has contended that OTS acted with improper bias
and prejudice and in bad faith against Franklin. Although the
court has found that the OTS lacked statutory grounds for the
imposition of conservator and that the regulator made
erroneous findings and conclusions which lacked any
reasonable basis, the court finds that the regulator's
actions cannot be characterized as biased or prejudiced
against Franklin or taken in bad faith. It is most likely
that OTS/Topeka was motivated by the disturbing events that
had occurred earlier with regard to Silverado Savings and
Loan in Colorado and its difficulty with Franklin's unique
and innovative operations. Nevertheless, the court finds that
Franklin has not shown that OTS was motivated in its
decisions regarding the 1989 examination and the ultimate
imposition of the conservator in February 1990 by bias or
prejudice against Franklin or out of any type of bad faith.
                                                                                                       

   Final Comment
                                                                                                       

   The court's concern and review in this case is limited to
whether the OTS acted properly in February 1990 in appointing
a conservator for Franklin. The court realizes that Franklin
is not the same institution today that it was as of February
16, 1990, after six months of control by RTC. There could
very well be some difficulty in Franklin's management
reacquiring control and operating Franklin today. That,
however, is not the court's concern. The court was asked to
determine whether the regulator's action was valid and
appropriate at the time it was taken. We have performed this
task in an expeditious and judicious manner.
   The facts of this case clearly show that the regulator
acted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship. This court
must correct that wrongful action. Any problems in the
reacquisition of control by Franklin's management is a direct
result of the OTS's wrongful conduct in February 1990.
   It will now be the responsibility of Franklin's
management, and not the court, to effectively develop a plan
for operating the association after six months of
conservatorship, during which they had no control.
