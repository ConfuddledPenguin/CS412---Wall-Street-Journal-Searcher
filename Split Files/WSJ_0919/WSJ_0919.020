   TOKYO -- Japan's household spending rose an
inflation-adjusted 1.3% in July from a year earlier, the
government said.
   The year-on-year growth compared with a 2% increase posted
in June. Although the pace slowed down, July's data showed
that "consumer demand remained robust and steady," a
government official said.
