   Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported a total loss of
$126.3 million for the 13 weeks ended Aug. 4, a somewhat
better performance than a year earlier.
   At the same time, the two companies -- both of which filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection on Jan. 15 --
reported that their total revenue for the period decreased
slightly. Most retailers experienced sluggish sales during
the summer months, leading many Wall Street analysts to
speculate that the fall and Christmas selling periods will be
more difficult than earlier anticipated.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Federated reported a loss of $80 million for the quarter
ended Aug. 4 compared with a $78.9 million loss in the same
period a year earlier. Allied suffered a $46.3 million loss
compared with a $56.2 million loss in the same period a year
earlier.
   Revenue at Federated decreased 3.5% to $983.8 million for
the quarter compared with $1.02 billion in the same quarter a
year earlier. Revenue at Allied decreased 7.8% to $540.9
million compared with $586.8 million last year.
   A spokesman for Federated and Allied also noted that the
cash flow from continuing operations was stronger than
expected for both companies.
