   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund plans to
seek money from countries reaping higher profits as a result
of recent high oil prices and to lend it at subsidized rates
to nations hit hard by the rise in energy prices, a senior
financial official said.
   The official, who spoke on the condition that he wouldn't
be identified, declined to name the countries that might be
approached for funds, but he said they include the big
oil-producing nations. The countries that might be able to
borrow the funds at below-market interest rates would include
the Philippines, India, Brazil and the Dominican Republic;
all have trouble paying market rates of interest but don't
necessarily qualify for sufficient concessional lending, he
said.

   The idea still must be approved by the IMF's board, which
gathers here next week for its annual meeting. Details,
including the terms by which the oil-producing nations would
provide the funds, would have to be worked out later.
   The IMF believes the impact of the oil price rise on
industrialized countries will be quite limited, provided it
is passed through to consumers quickly rather than allowed to
fuel a sustained rise in inflation. The official said the IMF
expects the rise to trim about 0.5 percentage point from the
output of industrialized countries in 1991. He said higher
oil prices will add about 0.25 percentage point to inflation
this year and between 0.50 and 0.75 of a percentage point
next year.
   The international agency is assuming that oil prices will
average about $26 a barrel in the fourth quarter. Although
prices currently are hovering about $33 a barrel, futures
market prices suggest they will drop to the lower level in
the fourth quarter, economists say. Further, the IMF expects
oil prices to decline to about $21 a barrel by late 1991. Its
forecasts are based on the assumption that the current
situation in the Persian Gulf continues.
   The IMF is strongly against easing monetary policy to
accommodate higher oil prices. The IMF's "clear response" to
the oil price rise is that monetary authorities shouldn't
accommodate this shock with easier monetary policies, the
senior financial official said.
   The IMF official ruled out establishing specific loan
pools such as those set up at the IMF in the 1970s to cope
with the oil price shocks of 1974 and 1979. He added that the
IMF is in a much better position to monitor the effects of
oil price rises now than it was in the 1970s because many
more countries now have IMF programs. There are 50 such
countries today, compared with 20 in 1979 and only 10 at the
time of the first oil shock.
   On other matters, the official said the Soviet Union could
soon become a member of the IMF. "I don't see any special
obstacles," he said. He added that the Soviets haven't as yet
formally applied for membership. The Soviet Union will for
the first time attend next week's IMF and World Bank meetings
as an official observer.
   The senior official also defended the IMF's recent
strategy in its negotiations with Brazil. The Institute of
International Finance, a Washington-based bank lobbying
group, has attacked the IMF for negotiating with Brazil even
though that country hasn't paid billions of dollars of
overdue interest arrears.
   The official said that an IMF economic program with Brazil
will be submitted only to the organization's board if the IMF
is "reasonably sure" that commercial bank negotiations have
started "in full good faith."
   While banks want countries to use their reserves to clear
interest payments arrears, the IMF has to balance that
consideration with the need to establish sound economic
programs in debtor nations, the official said.
