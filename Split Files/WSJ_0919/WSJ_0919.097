   MOSCOW -- In the late 1960s, Stanislav Shatalin worked on
an economic theory known as "optimal planning" that was
supposed to make the Soviet system of central planning
foolproof. Today, he is the main author of proposals to undo
central planning and create a market economy in the Soviet
Union in just 500 days.
   Abel Aganbegyan, who has helped Mr. Shatalin fine-tune his
market proposals, told parliament this week that the Soviet
economy is in a "catastrophic situation" and can recover only
if the Shatalin plan is quickly implemented. But less than
two years ago, Mr. Aganbegyan was advocating a streamlined
system of central planning, including more state investment
in heavy industry, to dig the economy out of its hole. Such
policies are now widely blamed for the economy's dire state.

   Perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's botched attempt to
overhaul the Soviet economy, has done strange things to the
beliefs and reputations of the nation's leading economists.
Cherished theories have been turned on their heads, and
once-committed Marxists are starting to sound a bit like
Milton Friedman.
   Rather than defending the old system or trying to improve
it, as they once used to, many Soviet economists now agree
that it has to be jettisoned entirely to avoid collapse. The
only way forward, they argue, is to emulate Western theories
and practices they once denounced, such as stock markets and
private property. If this leads to inflation and unemployment
-- long blasted by Soviet propagandists as the twin evils of
capitalism -- then so be it.
   In most places, such astonishing shifts of thinking might
raise questions about the integrity of the people concerned.
But in the Soviet Union, these turnabouts are viewed as proof
of a willingness to abandon dogma and learn from mistakes.
   The very failure of Mr. Gorbachev's reforms to date has
been the catalyst. Like several Soviet leaders before him, he
sought to make the Stalinist economic structure more
efficient when he took office in 1985. But his attempts to
loosen up central planning unbalanced the economy, causing
shortages of basic goods such as bread and shoes,
exacerbating the budget deficit and triggering inflation.
   "Five years of perestroika were necessary for people to
change," says Grigory Yavlinsky, a 38-year-old radical
economist and deputy premier of the Russian republic. "A lot
of mistakes were made in our economic policy, which is why
there are such poor results now." But without these errors,
he says, "the psychology of {economists} would have been
totally unprepared" for the market reforms the nation is on
the verge of adopting.
   As a member of a new generation of up-and-coming
economists, Mr. Yavlinsky hasn't been through the same
conceptual contortions as many of his older colleagues. But
not all of them have totally reversed their views, either.
Some still stick to hard-line communism; others were always
more reform-minded. Nikolai Petrakov, Mr. Gorbachev's
economic adviser, quietly advocated the need for market
mechanisms long before they were fashionable. He was even
slammed as a "market socialist" by Pravda, the Communist
Party daily, in the 1970s.
   But Mr. Petrakov was an exception. Most economists kept
disagreements with official policy to themselves, or within
the walls of their institutes. Now that Mr. Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness, has allowed them to talk
freely, they spend a lot of time feuding with each other. One
acrimonious battle is complicating plans to introduce the new
market-based reforms on Oct. 1. On the one side is Mr.
Shatalin and a group of younger economists such as Mr.
Yavlinsky, who favor swift decentralization and deregulation
of the economy and the introduction of market prices for most
goods.
   On the other side is Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime
minister whose deep voice and dry manner exude an air of
gloom. Described by friends as a Marxist, Mr. Abalkin was
primarily responsible for drafting the government's more
cautious program of transition to a market economy. He favors
a continued big role for central bureaucrats, and wants to
maintain government-fixed prices for most goods, at least in
the short term.
   For two years, he has been the economist most closely
identified with government policy. Western bankers who know
him say he recognizes the flaws in the Soviet system. But he
continues to air doubts about the introduction of private
property and advocates hefty social programs to cushion the
blow of a more liberal economic system. He now says a market
system is needed, yet he co-authored a textbook published
this year filled with traditional swipes at capitalism. "The
main aim of capitalism is to squeeze out surplus value" from
the workers, the book lectures, in true Marxist style.
   But Mr. Abalkin suffered a severe blow along with his
mentor, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, when President
Gorbachev last week said he preferred the Shatalin plan. The
deputy premier immediately went on the offensive, warning
that Mr. Shatalin's proposals amounted to little more than
"fairy tales" and would lead to a sharp drop in living
standards.
   Mr. Shatalin, a mercurial 56-year-old who is dogged by
ill-health and looks 10 years older than his age, soon struck
back. He told parliament that "we need different
authorities," a hint that Mr. Abalkin should resign. After
Mr. Gorbachev ordered that the two sets of proposals be
combined, Mr. Shatalin immediately said the unified version
"is 99% mine."
   In fact, officials say he worked with Mr. Petrakov on the
proposal. The two men first met while attending Moscow
University in the 1950s and then become theoretical
economists at a Moscow institute. This theoretical background
may explain why Mr. Shatalin is more able than Mr. Abalkin to
leap political hurdles.
   "Shatalin is more uncompromising than Abalkin," says
Albert Yeremin, a conservative economist who knows both. "He
doesn't like ideological terms such as a socialist or planned
market."
   The Shatalin-Abalkin dispute has marked the re-emergence
of Mr. Aganbegyan, a portly 57-year-old Armenian. He rose to
prominence soon after Mr. Gorbachev took office in 1985,
devising a blueprint for the first stage of perestroika. But
his belief in accelerating economic growth and spending huge
sums to modernize industry without undertaking more
fundamental changes to the system are now blamed for many of
perestroika's woes.
   "He has a technocratic approach to reform," says Tatyana
Koryagina, a radical economist who has known Mr. Aganbegyan
since the 1960s, when both worked in Siberia. She says he was
completely caught out when perestroika started to go wrong,
despite or because of his policies.
   After disappearing for a couple of years, traveling the
world as an unofficial Soviet economic envoy, Mr. Aganbegyan
resurfaced last month when Mr. Gorbachev asked him to draft a
compromise reform plan incorporating both the Shatalin and
Abalkin proposals.
   "It proved impossible to unite the two," Mr. Aganbegyan
conceded to parliament this week. Then, endorsing Mr.
Shatalin's variant, he warned that the economy "is much worse
than it appears." Compared with what could lie ahead unless a
market system comes soon, he said, the present shortages are
just "a joke."
