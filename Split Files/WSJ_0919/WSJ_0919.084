   WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation to restrict
textile imports by a 271-149 vote, a margin that indicates
there may be insufficient support to override President
Bush's expected veto.
   Backers of the bill need a two-thirds majority of those
voting in the 435-member House, or at least 280 votes in
yesterday's case, to override a presidential veto of the
bill, which would hold textile import quotas at current
levels for one year and limit future increases to 1% a year.

   In capitals around the world, the textile bill is seen as
a barometer of protectionist sentiment in the U.S. That's
partly because the measure has become a focus for opposition
in this country to the current round of international
negotiations on reforming the world's trade treaty, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The Bush administration, arguing that the U.S. needs open
markets to sell its goods overseas, has set successful
completion of the GATT talks as its top trade priority. The
trade talks are named the "Uruguay Round" because they began
in that country in 1986.
   "Enactment of the bill would almost certainly kill the
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations," says William Cline, a
senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a
Washington-based think tank. In a recent letter to House
Speaker Thomas Foley, Secretary of State James Baker warned
that the proposed legislation would directly violate 38
existing trade agreements.
   Recalling the protectionist legislation that preceded the
Great Depression, Mr. Cline termed the textile bill "the
Smoot-Hawley tariff act of the 1990s." He estimated that it
would cost consumers $5 billion in 1992. The cost would total
$48 billion by 2000, he said.
   The textile lobby, led by the American Textile
Manufacturers Institute, has argued strongly for the
legislation. It claims that imports of textiles and apparel
are harming the domestic industry, even though it conceded
such imports grew only 2.2% in the first seven months of 1990
compared with the same period a year earlier.
   "The overwhelming House vote in favor of the textile bill
shows that Congress believes very strongly that the time has
come for our government to slow down the flood of imports
threatening one of our most basic and essential industries,"
said the textile group's president, Donald Hughes.
   A coalition of retailers, apparel manufacturers, importers
and other freer-trade interests has gathered to oppose the
measure. "Today's vote, which failed to receive a two-thirds
majority, indicates that shortsighted, costly, special
protection doesn't always carry the day in the U.S.
Congress," said Ronni Nass, a director of the American
Association of Exporters and Importers and vice president for
imports at McCrory Corp., a New York-based retailer.
   The Senate this July passed the textile legislation by a
68-32 margin -- more than the two-thirds majority needed to
override a presidential veto. Since then, the Bush
administration has campaigned against the bill. Now that the
House has acted, Mr. Bush is expected to carry out his veto
threat soon.
   The textile industry has pushed similar legislation
previously. In September 1988, the House voted 248-150 to
override a presidential veto, failing to muster a two-thirds
majority.
   The administration has bombarded Congress with arguments
against the current bill. Michael Boskin, chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers, recently told Rep.
Philip Sharp (D., Ind.) that the legislation would cost
American consumers $30 billion over five years. He said this
burden would fall most heavily on lower income families that
spend a higher fraction of their household budgets on
clothing and other affected items.
   While the bill might add jobs in the textile industry, the
cost would be about $70,000 a job, Mr. Boskin argued. "The
legislation taxes U.S. consumers and the retail industry in
order to subsidize the textiles industry," Mr. Boskin wrote.
