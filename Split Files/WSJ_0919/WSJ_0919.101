   FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Prime Motor Inns Inc., only a year
after becoming the second-largest hotel concern in the U.S.,
said it filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   In a statement, Prime Motor added that Servico Inc., a
unit of FCD Hospitality Inc., which owes a large sum to Prime
Motor, filed a Chapter 11 petition in the same U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Miami. No other details were provided
concerning the filing, however, and the company declined to
comment yesterday.

   Prime Motor shares, which stopped trading for several
hours yesterday pending news of the filing, have now lost
practically all of their market value. Yesterday, they
plunged 75 cents to close at 50 cents a share in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. With 33 million
shares outstanding, the indicated value of the company was
$16 million; just last week, Prime Motor stock was trading at
$3.375 a share, giving an indicated value of $111.3 million.
Last year, the stock traded as high as $38 apiece.
   As a result of the filing, Prime Motor Inns L.P., which
indirectly owns 16 Holiday Inn motels leased to a Prime Motor
Inns unit, said it may not be able to pay distributions to
its unit holders. Also, Ramada Assured Income Associates,
which is managed by two Prime Motor Inns' units, said the
filing would result in a smaller payout to its unit holders.
   The filing comes less than a week after Prime threatened
such an action unless it could obtain additional loans and
other financial relief from its bank lenders. Prime Motor
sought to extend the maturity date of existing loans, obtain
a fresh $25 million loan and to restructure terms of sharing
proceeds from asset sales.
   But yesterday, people familiar with the lenders said the
banks were still considering the requests and hadn't come to
a decision when Prime Motor filed for Chapter 11 protection.
   Prime grew rapidly during the past several years, by last
year operating 1,100 properties with more than 150,000 rooms,
making it the second-largest hotel company. But in the
process of expansion, it also incurred heavy bank debt --
about $350 million -- just as financing became tighter and
the hotel market became depressed.
   Prime Motor has since reduced its bank debt, all due next
March 31, to about $110 million, primarily through asset
sales. It also sold the Rodeway Inns franchise to Manor Care
Inc., Silver Spring, Md., for $14.9 million. That left the
company operating 140 properties with about 14,000 rooms but
still straddling about $400 million in long-term debt apart
from the bank debt.
   As of March 31, when Prime Motor last reported its
results, the company had about $1.4 billion in assets and
about $913 million in liabilities.
   Following the latest announcement, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its subordinated debt rating of
both Prime Motor and Servico to Ca from Caa. The rating
downgrade affects Prime's convertible subordinated debentures
due 2011 and 2013, and Servico subordinated notes due 1997. A
total of about $318 million in debt is affected.
   Also, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it was dropping Prime
Motor from its stock index of 500 companies and adding JWP
Inc., a Purchase, N.Y., technical-services company, effective
today.
