   EUREKA SPRINGS, Ark. -- Unshaven, his sandy hair lapping
over the collar of his weathered denim vest, Herbie Shreve
roars into town on his Harley-Davidson, prompting a few
stares from the busloads of Bible Belt churchgoers here for
the outdoor passion play, one of the chief attractions of
this Ozark tourist haven.
   Mr. Shreve, however, has business elsewhere. He heads his
motorcycle down a gravel road rutted like a washboard and
pitches a tent in a lakeside clearing where hundreds of other
bikers have gathered for a boozy weekend rally. Here, he will
spend the next 48 hours as he spends most weekends: trying to
save souls.

   Biking and Bibles would seem an unlikely combination. But
as a leader of the Christian Motorcyclists Association,
33-year-old Mr. Shreve is no purse-lipped, fire-and-brimstone
evangelist. Eschewing what he calls the pushy "vacuum cleaner
salesman" approach, he's as adept at "kickin' tires" --
talking shop with other bikers -- as he is at quoting
Scripture.
   The CMA encampments that are fixtures at most motorcycle
events nowadays provide free ice water and Biblical tracts,
as well as volunteers eager to preach the Gospel should a
biker amble by. But there is no hard sell. "They will seek us
out when it's the right time," Mr. Shreve says serenely.
   Mr. Shreve is thus able to mingle easily with people like
"Cowboy," a towering, long-haired biker from Little Rock who
rides with the tough Bandido club. "As long as he doesn't try
to judge me, we get along fine," Cowboy says of Mr. Shreve.
"I'm a Christian and not ashamed of it," he says. "I just
live differently than the CMAers do. They stick closer to the
rules."
   CMA was founded by Mr. Shreve's Baptist-preacher father,
Herb Sr., who took up motorcycling to draw closer to his
then-rebellious teen-age son. As the pair biked around the
heartland, often snubbed by fellow Christians when they tried
to attend church along the way, the preacher hatched plans
for a motorcycle ministry. "Jesus said, `Go on the highways
and hedges,' and that always stuck with me," says the elder
Mr. Shreve. "I felt churches ought to be wherever the people
were."
   So in 1975, he resigned from his church in Cove, Ark.,
moved his family out of a comfortable parsonage and took to
the road. The pastor's wife, Shirley, who found herself
suddenly supporting the family with Tupperware parties, gave
him one month to make good.
   The group has since grown to 33,000 members in more than
300 chapters in the U.S. and Canada, Herbie Shreve says.
   To get to Eureka Springs, Herbie Shreve and his wife,
Diane, have cycled four hours from their home in Hatfield,
Ark., where CMA is headquartered. At the campground, they
rendezvous with about 20 CMA compatriots and plunge into the
festivities: a noisy parade through town, motorcycle games
and races. Vultures soar overhead, beer flows and a blues
band plays at top volume through the night.
   Some CMA members led rough-and-tumble lives prior to
joining up. "There were no warrants out on me, but I'd been
around the block a few times," says bearded Bill Wisely, a
hospital janitor in Jackson, Ark. Three years ago, he says,
"God started giving me the word it was time to turn my life
over to Him."
   Tonight, he talks not only of the bike show he helped
judge at the rally, but of "witnessing" to some attendees.
   Greg Heinritz of Oden, Ark., used to ride a bike painted
with images of nude women. Now the bike sports murals
depicting Jesus reaching down to bikers on the road. His
famous "Jesus bike," as it's known, has been on prominent
display at big rallies and featured as a "centerfold bike" in
many biker magazines.
   Mr. Heinritz now is a paid CMA evangelist -- and Herbie
Shreve says the bike led one of his young sons to accept
Christ.
   Plenty of CMAers are simply church people looking for a
wholesome crowd to ride with. Some shun what they call
"secular rallies," such as this one. Instead, they congregate
at CMA events that feature Bible study and Gospel music.
   CMA member Frances Wing of Cincinnati, Ark., prayed hard
before deciding to attend a secular rally. "The Lord and I
decided I shouldn't hold back," she recalls. Now she finds
that witnessing to the "down-and-outers" -- the CMA term for
hard cases and rough customers -- is easier than trying to
win converts among the prosperous professionals who have
taken up biking in recent years.
   "They think they are all right, that they're going to go
to heaven," Mrs. Wing says of the upscale crowd. The more
menacing bikers, on the other hand, "know they are sinners."
   During winter months, CMA runs weekend workshops where
skills such as witnessing in parking lots and "handling
negative responses" are honed. Members are also reminded not
to restrict their ministry to motorcyclists. As Herb Shreve
Sr. put it in a recent newsletter: "If Jesus physically lived
in America today and rode a motorcycle, would He witness only
to motorcyclists in America? No way]"
   CMA doesn't assess dues or collect offerings at the
services it holds at motorcycle rallies. Member donations
fund its $500,000 administrative budget, which covers the
salaries of its 13-member staff (including eight paid
evangelists), publication of tracts and a monthly newsletter.
   In addition, it sponsors an annual fundraiser in which CMA
members solicit pledges for completing a 100-mile motorcycle
run. This year's proceeds, $284,000, went mostly for foreign
missions, such as the purchase of motorcycles and even mules
for local ministers in Central America.
   The CMA rank-and-file, who call themselves "weekend
warriors," ride at their own expense. Typical is Dewell
Grisham of Little Rock, a retired installer for AT&amp;T who puts
in 20,000 miles a year on his bike in voluntary service to
CMA. "The pay's not too good," he chuckles.
   "Riding for the Son," the motto embossed on CMA T-shirts
and jackets, isn't easy riding. Severe thunderstorms doused
Herbie Shreve on his way to Eureka Springs. The weekend
before, he camped in a Kansas cornfield in 108-degree heat.
"There was gobs of nudity, and we woke up Sunday morning with
a guy passed out in front of our tent," he says. And two CMA
women at this rally were sidelined all summer after cycling
accidents.
   But no one in CMA, members say, has ever been harmed by a
biker. The closest call came in the early days, when drunken
revelers surrounded Herb and Shirley Shreve's tent at a rally
in Sturgis, S.D., and threatened to burn it down. "Some of
those same people are close friends of mine today," says the
elder Mr. Shreve, who is 56 years old.
   Motorcycle events in general are much tamer now, he adds.
   It is dawn in Eureka Springs, and the CMA contingent fans
out through the campground urging last night's carousers to
join them by the lake for a Sunday service. Four years ago at
this rally, no worshippers bestirred themselves from their
tents, and Herbie couldn't hold a service. Today, about 20
groggy bikers straggle down to the dock.
   Herbie's brief, plain-spoken sermon touches on the bikers'
alienation: the unpaid bills, the oppressive bosses, the
righteous church ladies "who are always mad and always
right." His message: "If you call me, I'll help you fix your
life."
   Though the weekend brings no dramatic victories, Herbie
isn't discouraged. "Always on Saturday," he says, "you begin
to think, `Is this panning out?'" Peer pressure keeps some
away from services, he says. "But they come by afterwards and
talk. We don't get in a hurry to leave on Sunday morning."
   Sure enough, while breaking camp, the CMA group gives away
half a case of tracts to bikers who drop by their tents. And
as Herbie pulls out to leave, two bikers call to him,
thanking him for his words. "I don't remember seeing them at
the service," he says. "You're covering a lot more ground
than you realize sometimes."
