   Ralston Purina Co. said it expects to report a
fourth-quarter pretax charge of about $10 million, or about
10 cents a share, from the closing of a pet food plant later
this year.
   Ralston, based in St. Louis, said yesterday it expects to
close its Mechanicsburg, Pa., plant in "late November or
early December," depending on the company's production
schedule.

   The company said the closure affects about 160 employees,
100 of whom are paid on an hourly basis and 60 of whom are
salaried. The company said it will provide those employees
with severance and outplacement benefits.
   Ralston called the closing an "economic necessity." The
company said that it is facing "more production capacity than
needed," citing increased plant efficiency.
   Ralston said production from the Mechanicsburg plant,
which makes dry cat and dog food, will shift to other pet
food plants. The company said it has seven other pet food
plants in the U.S.
