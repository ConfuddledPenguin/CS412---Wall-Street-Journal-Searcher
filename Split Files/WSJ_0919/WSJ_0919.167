   American Stores Co., a leading food and drug retailer,
said it is exploring the sale of Acme Markets Inc., its
275-store East Coast subsidiary.
   Late yesterday, the Salt Lake City company announced that
its board had authorized management to seek buyers for the
Malvern, Pa., supermarket chain.

   Sale of Acme would help reduce American Stores' debt,
which soared to $2.3 billion after its 1988 takeover of Lucky
Stores Inc.
   Acme, which the parent said had sales of $3.3 billion last
year, has outlets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, New York and Virginia.
   J. L. Scott, chief executive officer of American Stores,
said proceeds would be used to reduce debt and allow American
Stores to build stores and modernize others.
   The company has agreed to sell its remaining Alpha Beta
stores in Southern California within five years to settle an
antitrust action brought by California.
   Last month, the company also agreed to sell its Buttrey
food and drug division for about $184 million to an
investment group led by management of Buttrey and the
merchant banking firm of Freeman Spogli &amp; Co.
   American Stores said that it had retained Lehman Brothers
to solicit bids for Acme.
