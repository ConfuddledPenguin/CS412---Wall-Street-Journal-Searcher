   CHICAGO -- A power failure at the Chicago Board of Trade
yesterday morning delayed the start of trading in Treasury
bonds and other financial futures for one hour and 25 minutes
to 8:45 a.m. CDT.
   A futures exchange spokesman said that a failure of a
transformer on the exchange's 13th floor caused the delay.

   With the Chicago market blacked out, some brokerage firms
routed orders to the London International Financial Futures
Exchange, which trades a futures contract similar to the
Treasury bond futures listed on the CBOT. The surge of orders
from Chicago boosted Liffe's Tbond volume by several thousand
contracts, but its average volume remained a fraction of the
CBOT's estimated 250,000 contracts traded yesterday.
   The temporary blackout didn't affect futures trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
