   TORONTO -- Curragh Resources Inc. said it reached an
agreement for financing that will allow it to proceed with
developing a lead and zinc mine in the Yukon.
   The mining concern said Bank of Nova Scotia agreed to
provide 55 million Canadian dollars (US$47.5 million) of the
estimated C$70 million cost of the project in non-recourse
financing. Exact terms weren't disclosed. Curragh is manager
of the Mount Hundere lead and zinc property and has an 80%
interest in the venture.
