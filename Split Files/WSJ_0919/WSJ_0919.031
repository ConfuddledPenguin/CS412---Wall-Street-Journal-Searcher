   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it will reorganize its
sales units in Belgium to create a wholly owned subsidiary to
strengthen European sales operations.
   The new unit, Toyota Motor Europe Marketing &amp; Engineering
S.A., will be capitalized at about 5 billion yen ($36.6
million). Toyota's existing subsidiary in Brussels and its
representative office in Belgium will be absorbed into the
new subsidiary.

   The Japanese car maker plans to send more vehicles through
Belgium instead of shipping them directly to its West German
subsidiary. In 1991, the number of vehicles shipped by the
Belgian subsidiary is expected to rise to 50,000 units, from
8,500 units in 1990.
