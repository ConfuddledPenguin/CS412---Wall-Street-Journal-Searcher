   BALTIMORE -- A former CIA agent who procured arms as part
of the secret Iran-Contra network supporting the Nicaraguan
rebels was convicted of four tax charges.
   Thomas Clines was found guilty yesterday by a jury in
federal court in Baltimore of making false statements on tax
returns to hide his arms-dealing profits in the Iran-Contra
affair. The jury deliberated for about three hours before
convicting Mr. Clines on all four counts in the indictment.

   Mr. Clines, whom prosecutors had portrayed as a central
figure in the Contra arms deals, is scheduled to be sentenced
Oct. 31. He faces a maximum prison term of 16 years and as
much as $1 million in fines.
   His lawyer attempted unsuccessfully during the 10-day
trial to portray her client's tax return misstatements and
omissions as minor and at worst, negligent, not criminal.
