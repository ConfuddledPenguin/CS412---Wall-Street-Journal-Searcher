   TOKYO -- Six months after pledging to form a global
business alliance, Japan's Mitsubishi Group and West
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG are expected to approve the first
joint projects here today.
   The agenda for the first top-level meeting since March
between the huge industrial groups could include small-scale
automobile- and part-making ventures in the East bloc,
aerospace development, and an aircraft-leasing partnership.

   Officially, a Daimler spokesman said, Chairman Edzard
Reuter and other officials are in Japan primarily to mark the
listing of the company's stock on the Tokyo exchange. "We
don't expect any concrete agreements," the spokesman said.
And a spokesman for Mitsubishi Corp., the trading company at
the heart of the industrial group, said there was "no
specified agenda."
   The most concrete plans appear to center on cooperation
between Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Daimler-Benz. The two
companies already cooperate in some businesses. Mitsubishi
officials have said that Daimler-Benz has asked the Japanese
to supply equipment and construction for an auto plant in the
Soviet Union, and to provide technology for a small-truck
plant to be built in East Germany.
   One of the most closely watched areas of the emerging
alliance is aerospace, where Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
is trying to build expertise. Both groups have floated ideas
for cooperation. Daimler-Benz hinted it might invite
Mitsubishi to participate in a planned aircraft-engine
manufacturing venture with the Pratt &amp; Whitney subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp. And Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
said it would seek to cooperate in developing a 75-seat
passenger plane.
   Those moves worry some American industry and government
officials, who fear that the Japanese are beginning to loosen
their exclusive relationship with U.S. aerospace companies.
   Japanese newspapers also have reported that Mitsubishi and
Daimler are considering a tie-up with Ireland's GPA Ltd., the
world's largest aircraft-leasing firm. Mitsubishi has a seat
on the GPA board, reflecting its 15% equity ownership. But
the Mitsubishi spokesman said he "cannot confirm such
speculative stories." In Shannon, GPA declined to comment.
