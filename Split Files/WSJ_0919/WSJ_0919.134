   PARIS -- French Industry Minister Roger Fauroux urged
troubled state-owned computer maker Cie. des Machines Bull to
negotiate a partnership with West Germany's Siemens AG or
Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. so it could compete in world
markets.
   As part of a recent agreement to acquire the computer
operations of Honeywell Inc. of the U.S., Bull already has a
cooperation agreement with Japan's NEC Corp. But Mr. Fauroux
said in an interview with the newspaper Les Echos that the
government prefers that the partner be European rather than
American or Japanese.

   Bull, whose losses in this year's first half tripled to
1.88 billion francs ($361.5 million) from last year's first
half, declined comment. The industry minister said the
government would consider authorizing Bull to swap shares
with a European partner, as state-owned auto maker Renault
S.A. did with Sweden's AB Volvo, in effect partially
privatizing Bull. Another option, Mr. Fauroux said, would be
for Bull to set up joint subsidiaries with a European
partner.
