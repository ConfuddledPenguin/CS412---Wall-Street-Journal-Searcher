   WASHINGTON -- The savings-and-loan bailout agency, in a
blow to its efforts to stir up publicity for its real estate
sales, canceled its highly promoted November auction and said
it's unlikely another auction could be mounted before year
end.
   Cancellation of the Nov. 15 auction was the latest of a
number of setbacks for the beleaguered agency. Though only
about $300 million of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s $18
billion in real estate assets were to be offered, the RTC
hoped the high profile of the event, with satellite
connections to nine U.S. cities and London and Tokyo, would
draw hundreds of bidders and stimulate interest in other
properties.

   Instead, officials said a dispute with the auctioneer had
caused them to cancel the event, and a new auction would have
to be planned almost from scratch, with a different bag of
properties. "It's probable an international auction won't be
how we will sell these properties," said David Cooke, the
RTC's executive director.
   The properties, which include about 70 office buildings,
hotels, and shopping centers, probably will be sold
individually using sealed bids rather than auctions. He added
that another big auction intended to whip up investor
interest almost surely couldn't be held "before the end of
the year."
   William Seidman, chairman of the RTC, said: "This does not
mean we are not going to proceed with auctions." But he
indicated that the agency would move carefully in setting up
another one. "It says that unfortunately we didn't do the job
we should have done," Mr. Seidman said. "We got a contractor
who couldn't perform and that's our fault," he added.
   The RTC said the auctioneer it hired, Auction Co. of
America, failed in the past few days to put up $2 million
earmarked for marketing costs, as required under the contract
for the auction. The $2 million was supposed to be part of a
$2,850,000 fund, with the rest contributed by the RTC.
   Jim Gall, president of Auction Co. of America, accused the
RTC of handling the planned auction incompetently. He said
the RTC had scared away investors by failing to set minimum
prices and by pulling properties from the initial list
released in early August.
   Indeed, Mr. Seidman said the RTC already had received
offers on four properties for a total of $39 million.
   Mr. Gall contended that the RTC had removed the four
properties from the auction. The RTC is "bragging that {the
offers are} a good point and I find it very upsetting," Mr.
Gall said. For an auction to work, Mr. Gall asserted, bidders
must know "the property will be there on auction day."
Otherwise, he said, they won't spend the money necessary to
research the properties. For the same reason, he said,
bidders were frightened because the minimum prices hadn't yet
been set.
   Mr. Gall acknowledged that he didn't put up the $2 million
as was required once the RTC and the company agreed on a
budget for the auction. But Mr. Gall said the negotiations on
the budget ended only two weeks ago, and that he already has
spent "just under" $2 million on accountants, public
relations and other costs.
   Mr. Gall said he tried to submit the expenses in lieu of
the $2 million, but the RTC asked for cash. He said the RTC's
actions in handling the auction scared away investors from
whom he tried to raise the money to meet the RTC's demands.
   The RTC's Mr. Cooke strongly disputed Mr. Gall's
assertions. "He ain't sunk $2 million into it," Mr. Cooke
contended, adding: "We deny that it's our fault he didn't
come up with the $2 million."
