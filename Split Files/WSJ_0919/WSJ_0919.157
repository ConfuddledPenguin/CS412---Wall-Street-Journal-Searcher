   A federal judge in Cleveland preliminarily approved a
proposed legal settlement between DWG Corp., Miami, and
Granada Investments Inc., New York.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas D. Lambros said he will
consider any shareholder objections to the settlement at a
fairness hearing on Nov. 14. As part of the settlement, three
independent, court-appointed directors will serve on DWG's
board for five years, heading the audit and compensation
committees.

   DWG and Granada agreed on Sept. 4 to end their five-month
battle. Granada sued DWG's board in April 1989, charging that
DWG directors had shirked their fiduciary responsibility by
not seriously considering Granada's $22-a-share, or $572
million, offer for DWG in March 1989. The suit also attacked
the high salary and other perquisites of DWG Chairman Victor
Posner, the Miami financier. DWG owns enterprises such as
Arby's Inc. and Royal Crown Cos., and is the crown jewel of
Mr. Posner's empire. DWG countersued, claiming Granada's bid
wasn't a serious offer, rather, a scheme intended to
manipulate the market for DWG shares and allow Granada to
benefit from the stock's price increase.
