   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency said
nine major companies have agreed to substantially reduce
emissions of toxic chemicals at 40 plants in 14 states.
   At a briefing, EPA chief William Reilly also announced
that the agency is issuing a new guidebook on asbestos that
emphasizes that removal isn't necessarily the best way to
reduce potential exposure to the substance. In addition, he
said he is pleased with the progress made recently by House
and Senate conferees that are reconciling their differing
clean-air bills.

   Mr. Reilly said the emissions cuts, which will be
completed in December 1993, would reduce overall toxic air
emissions from these facilities by almost 83%, or 9,460,000
pounds, annually. "This is an extraordinary voluntary effort,
demonstrating that EPA and industry can work cooperatively to
address environmental problems," Mr. Reilly said.
   The nine companies are BASF Corp.; Dow Chemical Co.; Exxon
Corp.; General Electric Co.; Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.;
Occidental Petroleum Corp.; Reichhold Chemicals Inc., a
subsidiary of DIC Americas Inc.; Texaco Inc. and Texas
Petrochemicals Corp. Some of the plants could get credit for
reductions that would be required under proposals pending in
the clean-air conference.
   The largest cut from a single plant would come from a GE
plant in Mt. Vernon, Ind., which is scheduled to cut
emissions of methylene chloride, which the EPA lists as a
probable human carcinogen, by 6,113,390 pounds a year. A
Texaco facility in Port Neches, Texas, is scheduled to reduce
emissions of butadiene, a probable human carcinogen, by
1,199,230 pounds a year.
   The agreement grew out of an August 1989 meeting when Mr.
Reilly sought commitments from senior officers of these nine
companies and the Chemical Manufacturers Association. The 40
plants are on a list of 182 facilities the agency has
identified as having high estimated risks from toxic air
emissions. As part of the agreement, the companies will
submit annual reports describing their progress.
   On asbestos, the EPA said the substance is a health hazard
only when its fibers are breathed into the lungs. But if
asbestos isn't airborne and isn't releasing fibers, it should
be maintained until buildings are renovated or demolished,
the agency said.
   The EPA insists that its new guidebook represents a
renewed emphasis rather than a change in policy. Many school
officials and building owners, however, have believed that
the EPA has been encouraging costly asbestos removal.
   A Goodyear spokesman said the company has already achieved
a 61% reduction in emissions of butadiene at four of its
plants since December 1988 and expects further reductions by
January 1991.
   "We agree emission reductions must be a top priority and
in 1987 we committed to reduce emissions by 75% over a
five-year period," said Joe Murphy, human resources manager
at the GE plastics' site in Mount Vernon, Ind. Mr. Murphy
added that GE is planning a "long-term process change" that
will eliminate more than 80% of the methylene chloride
emissions at the site by 1993.
