   Mission Resource Partners L.P. of Walnut Creek, Calif.,
said it entered discussions with an independent oil and
natural gas company, which it declined to identify, to
purchase substantially all of Mission's remaining assets.
   Mission, which has interests in about 475 oil and gas
wells primarily in California, said the acquisition, if
completed, would dissolve its master limited partnership.
Unit-holders would probably receive $9 to $10 a unit,
President Douglas K. Brown said.

   In July 1989, Mission first announced that it was seeking
the sale or merger of its partnership, and it has since sold
several producing properties and property interests.
