   France's Groupe Strafor S.A. plans to acquire Facom S.A.
through a stock swap valued at 2.06 billion francs ($397
million).
   The companies said they will ask their boards next week to
approve the exchange of 13 Strafor shares for every 10 Facom
shares. Strafor shares closed yesterday at 1,015 francs, down
25 francs from when trading was suspended Monday for the
announcement. Facom shares declined 80 francs to 1,290
francs.

<TEXT>
   The 2.06 billion franc valuation is based on the new value
of Strafor shares and the fact that about 1.56 million Facom
shares are outstanding.
   The move will establish Strafor as the holding company for
the group, with control of almost all of Facom's shares.
Facom will be set up as a separate operating unit.
   The groups said they will have about 15,000 employees when
the merger is completed.
   Facom, which claims to be the European leader in the hand
tools market and third world-wide, had consolidated net
profit of 141 million francs in 1989 after payments to
minority interests. Revenue totaled 1.89 billion francs.
   Strafor, which is active mainly in the areas of office
furniture and metals, generated consolidated net profit of
165 million francs after payments to minority interests last
year on revenue of 5.4 billion francs.
