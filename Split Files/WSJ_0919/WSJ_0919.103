   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced
plans to add features to its Unix operating system that will
increase its security and let it work on computers using more
than one central processor.
   The data-protection features will be available in the
first half of next year. Some multiprocessing capabilities
will be provided in the first half; more advanced features
will become available in 1992.

   These capabilities had already been promised, as a group
led by AT&amp;T vied for control of the Unix standard with the
Open Software Foundation, led by International Business
Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. But the
announcement of a timetable for their availability is still
important because so many companies are betting their futures
on Unix. They hope to appeal to customers who don't want to
be tied in to one hardware supplier by their reliance on
software that runs only on that company's proprietary
operating system. And Unix requires features such as improved
security if it is to rival those other operating systems.
