   It's the American way: If there's a demand for a product
or service, there's bound to be an entrepreneur trying to
cash in. These days, revenge is no exception.
   Lesa Patrock says she never dreamed she would be using her
college degree in psychology and sociology to help others
plot revenge. Ms. Patrock, who runs the Dudley, Mass.-based
Local Revenge, says she spends most of her time on the
telephone with potential clients listening to them bare their
souls. Often, it's only after two, three or sometimes even
four such conversations that clients are ready to take the
plunge.

   "We do dirty deeds, not obscene things. Ones that get the
point across," says Ms. Patrock. People are often so angry
that they want to "flatten someone's tires or take their keys
down the side of someone's car," Ms. Patrock says. She
encourages them to spend their money, time and effort doing
something "cute" that still sends a message.
   For example, Ms. Patrock says she told an insurance
salesman's co-workers, who frequently had to cover for the
salesman when he was late for appointments, to rib him by
buying him a watch and an appointment book.
   For a $35 fee plus reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred while carrying out the act of revenge, Ms.
Patrock will deliver a specially tailored "revenge package"
to the client's chosen victim. One order came from a
secretary whose boss filled her days with menial tasks, such
as making the perfect cup of coffee and photocopying
seemingly endless pages of material. The package for her
boss, presented while others in the office looked on,
included the coffee cup, utensils, milk and sugar that he
would need to take care of his coffee himself -- along with
50 copies of her resignation letter, complete with a long
list of her complaints.
   In New York, there is Alan Abel, who touts himself as a
"Master of Retaliation." He is well known for engineering
media hoaxes, including the fake winner of a $35 million New
York lottery last January. For $25 for a 2 1/2-hour session,
far less than the fee likely to be charged for a comparable
visit with a therapist, anyone suffering from an
uncontrollable desire to exact revenge can sign up for Mr.
Abel's self-help class: "Don't Get Mad, Get Even."
   Mr. Abel figures that over the four years he has taught
the class at the Discovery Center in New York, he has
instructed about 1,200 students in the art of retaliation.
The students have ranged from doctors, lawyers, accountants
and financial analysts to undertakers, opera singers, belly
dancers and animal trainers. Their motivations have varied.
But high on the list, apart from wanting to settle the score
for a romantic relationship gone bad, is the desire to get
even with someone at work.
   "It's better to give ulcers than to get them," says Mr.
Abel, who in addition to his monthly classroom sessions,
provides his services through private consultations and a
manual that outlines 100 of his tried-and-true techniques.
   Among his suggestions: To embarrass the chain smoker in
the office, leave the smoke alarm on his or her desk. To send
a warning signal to the person who gives everybody a hard
time, leave a loudly ticking alarm clock in a gift-wrapped
box on that person's desk. And to stop a co-worker from
sticking his fingers in the petty cash, sending personal mail
through the company mail room and taking office supplies
home, send a note to the Internal Revenue Service suggesting
that this person might be running his own business on the
side and not declaring it on his taxes.
   Despite approaching his work with a sense of humor and the
bent of a practical joker, however, Mr. Abel would be among
the first to admit that revenge isn't always a laughing
matter.
   "The thesis I teach in class is that all of us want just a
little more space in life; we want what we paid for," Mr.
Abel says. "But there are a lot of piranhas and vultures
hovering around. So, sometimes you have to be a bit deceptive
to get what you want."
