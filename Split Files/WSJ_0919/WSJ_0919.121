   Cie. de Saint-Gobain said it applied for regulatory
approval to raise its holdings in the West German glass group
Oberland Glas AG above 50%, from the current level of 35%.
   A spokesman for the French glass and building-materials
group said, however, that the move is preliminary at this
stage and might not lead to an actual increase in its stake
until 1991 or 1992.

<TEXT>
   Saint-Gobain acquired its stake in Oberland in 1988
through a share swap with the Wiegand family, which retains a
25% interest. The French company has first refusal rights on
that 25% block, and would need prior regulatory approval
before it could exercise them.
   Oberland couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
