   The nation's major stock and futures exchanges said they
agreed to share regulatory information on troubled member
firms.
   The agreement among the 23 exchanges calls for sharing
financial and operational data on firms that are considered
at risk of falling below so-called "early-warning" capital
requirements set by the exchanges or the federal government.

<TEXT>
   The pact was drafted by the Intermarket Financial
Surveillance Group, which was formed after the October 1987
stock market crash in an effort to boost cooperation.
   The group includes exchanges and has as observers
representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
