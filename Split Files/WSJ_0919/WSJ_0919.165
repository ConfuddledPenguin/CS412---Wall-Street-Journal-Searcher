   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. spurned a $40-a-share, or $840
million, acquisition proposal from Aon Corp. and said it will
proceed with plans to merge with Willis Faber PLC of London
in a stock swap currently valued at $30.01 a share, or $615.2
million.
   But Aon, saying it found Corroon's rejection "incredible,"
reiterated its offer and said its all-cash bid "remains on
the table and is not being withdrawn." Initially, the
Chicago-based insurer had said it wouldn't proceed if
Corroon, an insurance-brokerage concern, opposed the bid.

   New York-based Corroon, which late yesterday unanimously
rejected Aon's bid, said it favored the international
presence it would gain by merging with the British insurance
broker. Richard Miller, Corroon's chairman and president,
said the planned merger with Willis Faber "has become the
centerpiece of our longstanding plans to internationalize our
operations. . . ."
   In a statement issued last night, Aon Chairman Patrick G.
Ryan said, "We find it incredible that they came to this
conclusion without even talking to us or to our investment
bankers about our proposal. They have never heard our
domestic and international strategy for a combined
Corroon/Aon which, like our price, is clearly superior to a
combined Willis/Corroon."
   Mr. Ryan said, "Our proposal was superior when made and
has become even more superior due to a fall in the Willis
Faber stock price." Indeed, since it launched its bid in
June, Willis shares have declined, while Corroon's jumped
last week on news of Aon's bid.
   Yesterday, Willis Faber fell two pence to 201 pence in
London trading. When Willis Faber made its merger proposal to
Corroon June 4, the offer was valued at $34.72 a share, or
$712.3 million, based on Willis Faber's closing price of 265
pence.
   Corroon shares closed at $35.50, down 37.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Aon rose 25 cents to
$32.25.
   Takeover-stock traders said Corroon's stock is likely to
fall $2 a share or more today because of the bid rejection,
which was announced after the market closed yesterday.
   With Aon pressing on with its bid for Corroon, the fight
could hinge on legal precedents set in last year's battle for
Time Inc. In the Time case, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled
that Time could reject an all-cash hostile bid from Paramount
Communications and proceed with plans to merge with Warner
Communications Inc. in a stock swap. Under the terms of the
stock swap, former Time shareholders would own about 40% of
the merged company's shares.
   The Delaware courts ruled that such a transaction didn't
constitute a change in control of Time and therefore Time's
board wasn't required to consider other bids, such as
Paramount's.
   Corroon, like Time, is incorporated in Delaware. Corroon
shareholders will own 40% of the merged companies and the
rest will be owned by Willis Faber shareholders. Some
takeover experts believe the Delaware courts are likely to
allow Corroon to reject any Aon offer and complete the
proposed merger with Willis Faber.
