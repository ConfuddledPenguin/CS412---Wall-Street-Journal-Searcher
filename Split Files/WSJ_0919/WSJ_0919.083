   MONROEVILLE, Pa. -- Heidi Fortwangler needed tires for her
car and dreaded the purchase. "I don't like to spend money on
tires because you can't eat them or wear them," she
complained.
   So when Mrs. Fortwangler arrived at a Tire America shop
here, one of her main concerns was not spending more than
$100 for two tires. She got her wish when the store manager
recommended a house brand tire priced at $27 each.

   "All most people care about is the price and how long it
will take for us to put them on," says store manager Timothy
Yowan. In the past six years, he adds, he has noticed a
falloff in loyalty to particular brands, especially as
technological advances have improved tire quality and blurred
the differences between premium and budget-priced tires.
   Stores like Tire America, a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,
offer a wide selection of tires that can deliver as much as
40,000 miles of driving at inexpensive prices. "For the
consumer, it's the best time in my 25 years in the business,"
says Thomas J. Reese, executive vice president of sales and
marketing at General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., a unit of Continental
AG of West Germany.
   But it's a tough time to be a tire maker. With auto sales
declining, the market for original equipment has dwindled,
making competition fiercer in the replacement market. At the
same time, a spate of foreign tire makers, which have gobbled
up most U.S. producers, are seeking to expand their presence
here. Pirelli S.p.A.'s bid to acquire Continental, announced
earlier this week, is expected to tighten the market even
more.
   The result: razor-thin profit margins. Many producers have
dumped inventories of tires slated for auto makers into the
replacement market, lowering prices. In addition, they have
focused heavily on low-priced tires that don't earn them
hefty profits but are one of the few growing markets.
"Pricing has been horrid and the mood in this business very
uneasy," says Edward Kalail, a spokesman at General Tire.
   Even companies that once snubbed the low-priced market are
vying for a foothold.
   Groupe Michelin of France began competing here this year
through its acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., a
producer of private label tires and some flag brands.
Michelin, also hurt by a pricing war involving original
equipment tires in Europe, is now predicting three or four
difficult years ahead.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., long known for its
premium-priced tires, this year at great expense rolled out a
line called the All-American Decathlon, priced between $27
and $45 and advertised for budget-minded drivers. A step up
are two lines of tires called Concordes priced from $24 to
around $55. Analysts estimate that profit margins on the
lower-end tires are in the 8% to 10% range, compared with 25%
to 30% for a Goodyear premium priced tire.
   Goodyear unveiled the cheaper tires because its dealers
were being clobbered by stores carrying lots of brands at
various prices. The company's strategy is to use the new
tires to attract a broader range of customers to its
dealerships. Tire buyers have to pay anywhere from $86.25 for
an Eagle ST to $424.40 for a Corvette high-speed tire that
bears the Goodyear name.
   "These {new} tires will allow our retailers to broaden
their appeal to every driver in the American household," Al
Eastwood, Goodyear's general marketing manager for consumer
products, said at introduction. "When it comes to
price-oriented buyers, we've not been at the party."
   Goodyear has reclaimed about 3% of the replacement market
it lost in recent years. But analysts believe Goodyear has
been losing money on some of its lower-priced lines. Recently
Goodyear said it expects to post a record quarterly loss --
$65 million in the third quarter after charges.
   Competitors also claim that Goodyear's plan could backfire
because consumers might purchase the cheaper tires at the
expense of Goodyear's branded lines. To avoid that, Goodyear,
whose officials declined to be interviewed for this article,
has unleashed an image advertisement campaign with the theme:
"The best tires in the world have Goodyear written all over
them."
   On the other hand, some tire makers have already conceded
that their flagship brands don't have the marketing pull with
consumers that they once had. As a result, tire makers such
as General Tire don't even bother with image advertising.
   "If you think you can glamorize tires to make sales,
you're kidding yourself," says General's Mr. Reese, who
previously held a similar position at Firestone. "We're
dealing with a product that nobody wants to buy," he says,
adding that many motorists "think of tires as nothing more
than a tax for driving."
   Customers agree. At the Tire America shop here, Richard
Jungo rubs his fingers over the treads of several tires and
compares the prices listed in ads from Tire America and its
competitors. "I don't stick to any particular brand because
I've tried them all and they're pretty much the same," he
says.
   General sells a substantial number of replacement tires at
bargain prices through Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and has been
buying stakes in independent dealerships in an effort to
increase tire distribution. At the same time General Tire
advertises regionally in cooperation with dealers. The ads
stress pricing, service and warranties.
   One of the major benefactors of changes in the replacement
market is Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., the only U.S. company
besides Goodyear that wasn't acquired by a foreign owner
during recent industry consolidation.
   Unlike its much larger counterparts, Cooper ignores the
original equipment market. Instead, the Findlay, Ohio-based
Cooper focuses on being a low-cost producer.
   It has been able to expand capacity and remodel equipment
at as much as half the cost paid by competitors like
Goodyear. Also, when the original-equipment market was
booming several years ago, many of the brand tire makers cut
back on private-label brands to increase supplies to auto
makers. Cooper, in turn, picked up a considerable
private-label business.
   Now its output is about evenly split between its own
brands and private-label tires for retailers such as Sears,
Western Auto and Tire America. The private-label tires don't
include any marketing costs, so retailers can usually price
them below branded tires of similar quality.
   "About 10% of consumers are very image conscious and
another 10% to 15% are very price conscious -- they own a
1976 Oldsmobile that runs forever," says a Cooper spokesman.
"But the bulk of motorists are value conscious. They want a
good, standard tire for 8,000 miles a year."
   The Middle East crisis could add to tire makers' problems.
Increased gasoline prices, for example, might force some
motorists to cut back on driving, which could crimp
replacement-tire sales. Also, a typical tire is made out of
the equivalent of six to eight gallons of crude oil, so
margins could be squeezed even more as a result of higher raw
material costs.
   But tire makers are trying to recoup some of these
additional costs and halt the price war. This summer, some
producers announced price increases of 4% to 5% that appear
to be sticking; a second similar increase will take effect
next month. For consumers, that suggests that now is the time
to buy tires for the family sedan.
