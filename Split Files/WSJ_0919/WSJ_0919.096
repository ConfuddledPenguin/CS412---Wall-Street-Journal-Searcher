   "Don't change horses in midstream"
   Isn't always as true as they say,
   But it's frequently noted and often quoted
   As a wonderful one-horse cliche.
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   Total Recall
                                                                                                       

   Those who forgive and forget
   Deserve reviews that rave --
   Except for those who do not
   Let you forget they forgave.
   -- Mimi Kay.
