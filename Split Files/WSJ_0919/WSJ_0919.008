   OTTAWA -- Canada's merchandise trade surplus narrowed to
1.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$1 billion) in July, partly
because of an increase in imports of autos and auto parts,
Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
   In June the surplus totaled C$1.81 billion.

   The U.S. took 77% of the total July exports and supplied
70% of Canada's imports.
