   LOS ANGELES -- Charles H. Keating Jr., former chairman of
American Continental Corp., surrendered to California
authorities yesterday on a 42-count criminal fraud
indictment. He was being held in a county jail here in lieu
of $5 million bail.
   Also indicted by the state grand jury, which since March
had been investigating the failure of American Continental's
California-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, were a
former president of American Continental and two former
Lincoln presidents. Bail was set at $1 million for Judy E.
Wischer, who with Mr. Keating resigned from American
Continental last month, and for Ray S. Fidel and Robin S.
Symes, the indicted former Lincoln officials. American
Continental is based in Phoenix, Ariz.

   The indictment alleges violations of the California
corporations code, prohibiting false statements in the sale
of securities and requiring securities transactions to be
within qualifications approved by the state. The case focuses
on the more than $200 million of unsecured American
Continental debentures sold to 23,000 investors, often
through Lincoln branch offices, before American Continental
filed for federal bankruptcy-court protection in April 1989.
   That bankruptcy-court filing rendered the debentures
worthless. Civil suits filed by bondholders, many of them
retired people who contend that they were targeted for bond
sales in Lincoln branches, have alleged that Lincoln
officials claimed that the debentures were federally
guaranteed and were as safe as insured certificates of
deposit.
   If convicted, each of the four faces a maximum prison term
of 10 years and a fine of $250,000.
   Attorneys for Mr. Keating, 66 years old, and for Mrs.
Wischer, 42, and Mr. Fidel, 32, left the courtroom without
commenting to reporters. The former American Continental
chairman, however, has insisted in the past that purchasers
of debentures were told they were unsecured. He also has
asserted that the bonds are worthless only because the
government forced American Continental into Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings by moving to seize Lincoln.
   Donald Smaltz, an attorney for Mr. Symes, called the
amounts of bail for the four "outrageous with a capital `O'"
and "punitive in nature." He said his client, who traveled
from his Ohio home to face the charges, has been unemployed
since leaving Lincoln last year. "That amount of bail is
impossible for Mr. Symes," the attorney said, adding that he
intends to seek a review.
   "Everybody was just shocked," Mr. Smaltz said of the bail
levels. "These people aren't selling anything. They're not in
a position to engage in any alleged securities violations,
which is what this case is all about, and they're not a risk
of flight," he said.
   The usually flamboyant Mr. Keating, himself a lawyer, was
unflinching in court, even when the $5 million bail was
imposed and he was led to a temporary courthouse lock-up
prior to an expected transfer to the central county jail in
downtown Los Angeles. Though Mr. Keating has been the center
of national controversy over his management of American
Continental for more than a year, these were the first
criminal charges to be filed against him.
   The four were booked, fingerprinted and photographed
before appearing before Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner.
The judge, who set formal arraignments for Oct. 5, said the
bail amounts reflected the seriousness of the charges and the
amount of loss by investors. He added that bail might have
been higher had the four not voluntarily surrendered to
investigators.
   The indictment had been sealed for a week, although its
existence was learned about Monday. The state's investigation
began last December, when Los Angeles County District
Attorney Ira Reiner was named to head a statewide
"prosecutors' task force" studying Lincoln's collapse in what
federal officials say is one of the costliest thrift failures
ever for taxpayers.
   Most attention nationally in the American Continental case
has involved charges Mr. Keating and others fraudulently
transferred funds out of Lincoln into American Continental
through phony tax and real-estate loan transactions, which he
has denied.
   The U.S. has filed a $1.1 billion civil racketeering suit
containing those allegations, and in ruling against Mr.
Keating's own separate challenge to the government seizure of
Lincoln, a federal judge said that American Continental's
activities "amounted to a looting of Lincoln." A federal
grand jury in Los Angeles also is investigating Mr. Keating
and others, according to people knowledgable about the
investigation.
   While yesterday's indictment itself was little more than a
list of bondholders, each connected to an alleged state-code
violation, the district attorney said the testimony of 94
witnesses to the grand jury could be unsealed soon to provide
more detail.
   The grand jury has been dismissed, although a spokeswoman
for Mr. Reiner said the investigation of Lincoln's collapse
continues and that another, sitting grand jury could hear
further evidence, or that other criminal complaints could be
filed.
   Mr. Reiner told a news conference that his intent was "to
have this be tightly focused so it could be easily understood
by a jury." He said previous efforts to prosecute alleged
thrift frauds often were "far too complex for a jury to
comprehend." Prosecutors, who said the desire to simplify the
case was one reason no more than four people were indicted,
estimated that their case could take only four to six weeks
to present.
