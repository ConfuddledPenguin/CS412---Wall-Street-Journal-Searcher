   Pan American Satellite is expected to appeal a federal
court decision to dismiss the company's $1.5 billion
antitrust suit against Communications Satellite Corp.
   The decision in federal court in Manhattan was on the
ground that Comsat has immunity from such lawsuits. PanAmSat,
a satellite operator based in Greenwich, Conn., filed the
suit in July 1989, alleging attempts by Comsat to limit
competition in the market for satellite transmissions. The
court said that agreements between the federal government and
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization
(Intelsat) as well as the International Organizations
Immunities Act gave Comsat, as the U.S. signatory to
Intelsat, immunity from antitrust suits.

   "My sense is that we will appeal," said Frederick Landman,
president of PanAmSat. He said that company lawyers were
examining the Friday decision. "We think the court gave an
incorrect reading" of the antitrust immunity issue, Mr.
Landman said.
   Comsat, based in Washington, D.C., welcomed the decision,
and reiterated its view that the lawsuit was groundless and
ironic because Comsat had urged other Intelsat members to
approve PanAmSat's operations.
