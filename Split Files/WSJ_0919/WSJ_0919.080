   ASIAN GAMES POISON THREAT

   Hong Kong supermarkets withdrew thousands of packets of
M&amp;Ms chocolates after an anonymous letter warned that a
packet had been poisoned to protest the manufacturer's
support of the Asian Games in Beijing.
   Dairy Farm Ltd., owner of the Wellcome supermarket chain,
said stocks of the candy were being cleared from shelves and
returned to the importers, Effem Foods Inc. of Hong Kong. A
spokesman for Effem Foods said: "We have asked for all
supplies to be withdrawn and returned. We will replace them
with fresh supplies and will check the returned stock to see
if there is indeed a rogue packet."
   Effem Foods, which imports the candy from Australia, where
it is made by Mars of Australia, said it received the letter
Monday warning that a packet of the candy had been
contaminated with sodium cyanide. The letter condemned
Beijing for its crackdown on dissent last year and said the
manufacturer was supporting China by sponsoring the Asian
Games, which begin Sept. 22.
   Said a police spokesman: "We are taking this seriously,
but we have not reached any conclusions yet."
                                                                                                       

   KUWAIT AIRWAYS KEEPS FLYING
                                                                                                       

   Kuwait's national airline has moved its headquarters to
Cairo and will start operating from the Egyptian capital next
month, a Kuwait Airways official said. Abdel-Razzak al-Otaki,
manager of the Egypt office, said eight Boeing planes that
were outside Kuwait when Iraq invaded his country on Aug. 2
would be used in the Cairo-based operation. "The main goal is
to keep the Kuwaiti flag flying in foreign capitals and
countries," he said. Iraq on Monday ordered the dissolution
of Kuwait Airways and transferred all its assets to Iraqi
Airways.
                                                                                                       

   PANAMA TO SUBSIDIZE GASOLINE
                                                                                                       

   Panama will not increase gasoline prices but will pay $20
million more for imported oil this year, President Guillermo
Endara said. "After studying all options, we have decided
that, until December 31 and depending on the price per barrel
remaining at $28, the government will assume the increase,"
the president said. Panama's average gasoline price is now
$1.98 per gallon.
                                                                                                       

   MORE QANTAS FLIGHTS
                                                                                                       

   Qantas Airways is adding flights to Hong Kong and London
from Australia in its winter schedule for the Northern
Hemisphere. Australia's national carrier said it would
increase flights to London to 14 from 12 a week; all will use
Boeing 747 aircraft. Flights to Hong Kong from Australia will
increase to 14 from eight a week, using Boeing 747 and Boeing
767-300 aircraft. The extra flights boost passenger capacity
to Hong Kong from Australia by 38% and to London by 16%. The
new schedule begins Oct. 28.
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINA'S DOLLAR ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   Argentina's Economy Ministry is set to approve checking
accounts in U.S. dollars as well as the austral, Buenos Aires
newspapers reported. The dollar already is Argentina's backup
currency, used for such purposes as renting and buying
apartments and paying for goods in many stores. Approval of
dollar checking accounts "will be implemented . . . within a
period of 10 days," La Nacion reported, citing an Economy
Ministry source.
                                                                                                       

   END OF AN ERA IN WALES
                                                                                                       

   Welsh miners voted to accept the closing of the Mardy
mine, the last coal pit in the Rhondda Valley.
   British Coal's decision to close the mine by Christmas, 10
months ahead of schedule, ends an industrial saga that made
Rhondda's name synonymous with mining before recession hit
the industry. "It is . . . a very sad day for everybody
here," said National Union of Mineworkers local Chairman Mike
Richards.
   Mardy's 300 workers accepted layoff payments or transfers
to the five surviving pits elsewhere in the South Wales coal
field. Said Mr. Richards: "Young men are going to find it
very difficult to get other jobs because there is such a lack
of industry in the area."
   The government has launched a program to revitalize the
area. Waste heaps are being flattened to make way for
high-technology factories the government hopes will cut
unemployment, running at more than 20% in some towns.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello traveled to
the Amazon yesterday to order the sealing up of a
1,050-foot-deep hole built by the air force and suitable for
nuclear tests. A presidential spokesman was quoted as saying
that Mr. Collor "has a vigorous position against these tests,
and for this reason ordered the shaft to be rendered
unusable." . . . In his annual state-of-the-world report,
United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
warned that the organization was stretched to the limit in
funds and manpower. "We have funds for only 24 further days
of operation," he said.
