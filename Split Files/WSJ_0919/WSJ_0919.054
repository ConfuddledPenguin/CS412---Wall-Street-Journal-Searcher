   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were mixed in the week ended
yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination, or "consumer," CDs
sold directly by banks were virtually unchanged. The average
yield on a six-month CD eased to 7.37% from 7.38%, according
to an 18-bank national survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a
New York information service. The average yield on a
five-year consumer CD rose to 7.91% from 7.90%.

   Also mixed were average yields on small-denomination CDs
sold by leading broker dealers. The average yield on a
three-month broker-sold CD fell to 7.74% from 7.87%,
according to Banxquote. The average yield for a two-year
broker-sold CD rose to 8.24% from 8.13%.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
flat to up slightly. The average yield on a two-year jumbo CD
remained at 7.92%, while the average for a five-year maturity
rose to 8.27% from 8.25%.
