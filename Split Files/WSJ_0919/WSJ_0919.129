   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
that Stotler &amp; Co., a now-closed Chicago futures firm,
settled SEC charges of securities law violations in
connection with its government-securities business.
   Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, Stotler
agreed to have its registration as a government-securities
brokerage firm revoked. The charges stem from Aug. 21, when
the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission brought
action against the firm. Stotler settled the CFTC charges but
hadn't resolved the SEC matter.

   Stotler is the futures-brokerage arm of Stotler Group
Inc., which was partly owned by former Chicago Board of Trade
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann. Mr. Mahlmann resigned his CBOT
post after another Stotler unit was charged by the CFTC with
making loans with customer funds from commodity pools.
   The SEC alleged that Stotler &amp; Co. failed to maintain
sufficient capital, failed to file documents and kept
outdated and improper records of capital levels and of
positions in the government-securities markets. The complaint
also charged that Stotler didn't notify the SEC that its net
capital was below the required minimum.
   Stotler Group filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in
federal bankruptcy court late last month.
   In Chicago, attorneys for Stotler &amp; Co. weren't available
for comment.
