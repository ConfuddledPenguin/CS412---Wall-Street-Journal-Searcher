   International Business Machines Corp. unveiled
communications software that it said will make it easier for
some of its computers to talk to those made by other
companies.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., said one of the products will
let its personal computers and AS/400 minicomputers
communicate with other companies' equipment via the Open
Systems Interconnection software standard, which is widely
used by non-IBM computers.

   Another product will let IBM mainframes talk to personal
computers in networks that use the Ethernet standard, which
also is used extensively to link equipment made by IBM's
competitors.
   IBM also announced mainframe software that it said will
let its electronic-mail systems tie into public networks such
as MCI Mail, by conforming to an emerging standard known as
X.400.
