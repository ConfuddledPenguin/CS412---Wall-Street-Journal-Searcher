   NEW YORK -- Loral Corp. said it will sell the BDM
International unit of Ford Aerospace to the Carlyle Group,
calling the sale "an exception" to its promise to keep the
newly acquired company intact.
   Under terms, Carlyle, a Washington merchant banking firm
that in July lost to Loral in a bidding contest for Ford
Aerospace, will purchase BDM for $130 million, including $115
million in cash and the balance in notes and warrants.

   BDM's 3,100 employees will be offered partial ownership of
the company, although an internal memo said details of the
equity agreement wouldn't be made available until the sale is
formalized, probably by mid-October.
   "Certainly we would have liked to get all of Ford
Aerospace, but life goes on," said a Carlyle executive.
"We're happy that we wound up with at least a piece."
   BDM, based in McLean, Va., is a professional services
firm, performing strategic planning and analysis; about 90%
of its work is for the Pentagon.
   Ford Aerospace, a Ford Motor Co. unit, bought BDM in 1988
for $425 million -- a price that many have said was too high,
given BDM's $350 million in annual revenue and $20 million in
earnings.
   And since then, the downturn in U.S. military spending has
only undercut the market value for all defense properties.
Indeed, Loral won all of Ford Aerospace for only $715
million, plus the promise to let Ford Motor keep $100 million
from the unit's overfunded pension plan.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, a Carlyle Group
vice chairman, will become BDM chairman. Earle Williams, the
BDM chief executive officer since 1972, will remain in that
post.
   Loral, a defense electronics company, said it sold BDM
because of an inherent conflict in having one unit that
advises the Pentagon on the kinds of weapons it needs, as
well as other outfits that actually make arms. "BDM told us
that it inhibited their growth under Ford Aerospace," Loral
Chairman Bernard Schwartz said. "We think we could have
managed the situation, but at the end of the day it just
wasn't worth it."
