   NEW YORK -- Responding to stiff competition, TV Guide will
publish two editions of its weekly magazine designed
specifically for Manhattan cable subscribers.
   The special TV Guides, to begin publishing Nov. 3, will be
sent to current subscribers who live in the Manhattan Cable
and Paragon franchise areas. They will also be available on
newsstands in the franchise areas of the two systems, along
with the existing New York Metro edition.

   The editions are part of a new effort by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp., which acquired TV Guide two years ago, to turn
around the declining fortunes of the television-listings
magazine. The two new editions, which include detailed
program listings and channel locations of cable programs in
each cable system, compete directly with currently produced
local guides.
   TV Guide launched its first special cable edition in 1986
for cable subscribers in the New York boroughs of Queens,
Brooklyn and Staten Island. Since then, it has introduced
customized editions in several other cities.
