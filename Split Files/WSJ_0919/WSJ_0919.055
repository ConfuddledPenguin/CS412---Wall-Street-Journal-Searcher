   ATLANTA -- The Olympics are returning to the U.S.
   The International Olympic Committee awarded the 1996
Summer Games to Atlanta, a move that could generate as much
as $3.5 billion in revenue and some 84,000 jobs for the local
and state economy.

   Considered the darkest of horses when it began its bid 3
1/2 years ago -- primarily because Los Angeles held the Games
in 1984 -- Atlanta defeated five other cities in what proved
to be the most competitive bidding for the Olympics in
decades.
   Atlanta won the prize on the fifth ballot taken among the
IOC's 86 members, who had gathered in Tokyo. Atlanta
collected 51 votes compared with 35 for the runner-up of
Athens, Greece. Athens had been the sentimental favorite
because 1996 will mark the 100th anniversary of the first
modern Olympics, which were held in Athens. The other
competitors were Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Manchester, England;
Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto.
   "Right now, we're going to sit back and say, `Thank you,'
do a little fishing, and get reacquainted with our spouses,"
said William Payne, president of the Atlanta Organizing
Committee and the force behind the city's bid.
   That might be all that Atlanta's organizers have time for.
By most accounts, the city won the Games for three reasons:
its incessant and highly successful lobbying of IOC members;
the city's infrastructure, including numerous hotels and one
of the world's largest airports; and the likelihood that
Atlanta will generate a sizable surplus, part of which goes
to the IOC.
   What the city lacks, however, are many of the basic
facilities needed to stage an Olympics. Atlanta estimates it
will have to spend more than $400 million on new construction
alone, including an 85,000-seat track-and-field stadium,
housing for athletes, a swimming and diving site, and a
velodrome for bicycling competition.
   Moreover, problems that were all but drowned out in the
clamor surrounding the city's bid -- including Atlanta's
exploding crime rate and extensive homeless population --
will likely resurface as millions of dollars from TV networks
and corporate sponsors pour into the Atlanta Organizing
Committee's coffers.
   For instance, within hours of the IOC's decision,
Greenpeace Action, a local environmental group, called on the
Games' organizers to "tie the growing problems of
homelessness in Atlanta to the development of the Olympics,"
and to "achieve full housing in the city by 1996."
   Perhaps the most difficult task Atlanta's organizers face
in the coming months is simply abandoning their role as
salesmen and adopting that of developers. "For three years,
they've been trying to win friends and influence people,"
said John Bevilaqua, a vice president at the Los Angeles
Olympics and now president of a sports marketing firm in
Atlanta. "Now they'll be working on a dozen fronts: dealing
with environmental impact studies; setting up a security
plan; trying to find 100,000 volunteers -- you name it."
   And while the 1996 Olympics are more than 2,000 days away,
Atlanta's organizers may begin to feel some pressure in the
not-too-distant future, according to one individual familiar
with the process.
   Barcelona, Spain, the site of the 1992 Summer Olympics,
"will become the focus of the world and shelter {Atlanta} a
bit," said Peter Ueberroth, head of the 1984 Games in Los
Angeles. But "immediately afterward, the time will go quite
quickly."
