   NutraSweet Co., seeking more ways to extend its sweetener
and diet food lines, said it will supply its Desserve foods
to Mrs. Fields Inc. in test markets.
   The agreement is NutraSweet's first effort to market
Desserve products -- mostly desserts, some of them making use
of aspartame sweetener -- through an alliance with another
widely known brand name. And it accelerates a new direction
for NutraSweet in marketing aspartame.

   "I think what they're saying is that they've gone through
all the categories" in which aspartame was used as an
ingredient in packaged goods and beverages, said Frank Blod,
a consultant to the food industry at New England Consulting
Group, Westport, Conn. "This is a play to get into food
service."
   NutraSweet, a Deerfield, Ill.-based unit of Monsanto Co.,
St. Louis, has so far offered Desserve products only through
its own three Desserve cafes in the Chicago area.
   David Wilson, the Desserve project manager, said
NutraSweet will be looking for additional outlets for the
line, including the in-store bakery or other specialty
sections in grocery stores. "That's where you would probably
see it, rather than on the {packaged goods} shelf or in the
freezer case," he said.
   In Mrs. Fields, based in Park City, Utah, NutraSweet has
found an ally whose name became synonymous with
entrepreneurial success since Debra "Debbi" Fields began
selling cookies from a single store that has grown into a 500
plus-unit chain. Mrs. Fields, the company's founder and chief
executive, said the Desserve line will help her diversify
beyond cookies through Mrs. Fields Bakery Cafes. There are 20
such cafes to date.
   NutraSweet expects to supply two Mrs. Fields bakery cafes
in Chicago by year's end, and four others in San Francisco
early next year. The supplier agreement could quickly expand
if it works out in those test markets. In addition, the
companies expect to cooperate in product development.
   Some consultants noted that NutraSweet, whose namesake
ingredient is in some 3,000 products, will have to tread
carefully while marketing its own food products in order to
avoid antagonizing customers. "What they have to do is
wrestle with what this will mean for the ingredient
business," said David Braff, chief executive of consultants
Braff &amp; Co., New York, though he called the NutraSweet-Mrs.
Fields deal "a good symbiotic relationship."
   But Mr. Wilson of NutraSweet said the Desserve line will
largely be marketed through different distribution channels
and points of sale.
   In baked goods, the line could also move into a category
that products containing NutraSweet haven't filled, since the
ingredient as currently formulated breaks down under heat.
The company is seeking federal approval for a new formulation
that, it says, holds up well under heat.
