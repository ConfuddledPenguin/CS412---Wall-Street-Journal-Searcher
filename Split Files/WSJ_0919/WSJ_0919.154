   BSN Corp. said it had agreed to provide a list of
shareholders to Pelham Investment Associates L.P., a Houston
investor group whose previous efforts to buy a controlling
interest in the sporting-goods manufacturer were rebuffed by
the company.
   In return for the BSN action, Pelham agreed to drop a
civil suit it had filed against BSN in a Delaware Court of
Chancery, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing.

   Pelham, which says it holds a 7.99% stake in Dallas-based
BSN, had previously said it was seeking a shareholders list
in order to solicit consents or proxies, but a spokesman said
the group hadn't decided whether to continue pursuing such
action.
   BSN President Michael Blumenfeld, who owns or controls
about 15% of BSN's stock, said the company only agreed to
provide the list because it was required to do so under
Delaware law. Mr. Blumenfeld also indicated that he remained
opposed to selling a controlling interest to Pelham. "We
don't think they have the ability to acquire anything," he
said.
