   Net for fiscal six months rose 52% to $28.2 million, or 60
cents a share, on a sales increase of 33% to $154.4 million.
   Chairman Arthur T. Shorin said the results reflected a
significant increase in sales of picture cards featuring

"Dick Tracy." He added that second-quarter sales include
about $6 million in sports card sets that were shipped
