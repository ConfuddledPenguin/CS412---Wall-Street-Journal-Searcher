   Xerox Corp. is to begin its latest bid to become a player
in the office computing market today, introducing a computer
workstation and a range of software products, industry
executives said.
   The workstation is a departure for Xerox because it will
be built by Sun Microsystems Inc. around Sun's widely
available Sparc microprocessor, the executives said. Xerox,
an office-products company based in Stamford, Conn., has sold
only proprietary workstations to run its well-regarded
Viewpoint software, used mainly for document-processing.
Xerox will also introduce a new version of Viewpoint written
for Sun's version of the Unix operating system, an industry
standard.

   Industry executives said Xerox also will introduce a skein
of software packages intended to tie together the various
computers and programs used in most offices, in an attempt to
give users of computer networks a consistent,
easy-to-understand view of their work. Aside from Unix, it
will work with DOS and OS/2, the operating systems used by
most personal computers.
   Xerox's new computing "environment," while still tilted
toward document-processing applications, will be presented as
a systemwide approach similar to highly publicized products
such as International Business Machine Corp.'s OfficeVision
or Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave, the executives said.
   The company is likely to promote its reputation as the
originator of many of the innovations in these packages, and
thus the most natural provider of software that exploits
them. A Xerox spokeswoman declined to comment on today's
announcement, which will be made in San Francisco.
   On Oct. 2, Xerox is expected to announce a large
multifunction copier-printer that will hook up with the
company's new products as well as a host of other hardware
and software products. That machine also will have scanning
and facsimile capabilities, and is expected to play a large
part in Xerox's push into office computing systems.
