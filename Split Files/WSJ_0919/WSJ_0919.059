   While rampaging Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait City were looting
jewelry shops, shooting racehorses and making macabre dinners
out of rare zoo animals, some more disciplined troops from
Saddam Hussein's army made off with the treasures of the
Kuwait National Museum.
   "It is one of the most fabulous collections of Islamic art
in the world -- and it is all handpicked," said Esin Atil,
historian of Islamic Art at Washington, D.C.'s Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery.

   The museum that Ms. Atil remembers -- a cultural
storehouse of some 7,000 objects from countries as far-flung
as Spain and India, dating from the eighth century -- no
longer exists except as a shell. On Monday, a representative
for the Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington confirmed rumors of
looting that had been heard in U.S. museum circles. The
condition and whereabouts of the museum's manuscripts
(including one of the oldest surviving texts of the Koran),
medieval carvings, princely textiles and precious gemstones
are unknown.
   The most detailed report to date of the sacking has been
provided by a former researcher at the museum who escaped to
London this month.
   "I heard reports on the 26th of August that the soldiers
had gotten into the museum, and decided to go and check for
myself," said the researcher, who out of concern for family
members still in Kuwait asked that her name be withheld.
   Under disguise, she and a friend entered the museum and
were introduced to its "new director," a uniformed Iraqi
official from the Ministry of Information. On that visit, the
museum seemed intact. But on Sept. 4, she saw four large
Iraqi army trucks parked outside the museum.
   "This time I couldn't get in as close . . . but there
appeared to be people in civilian {dress} and uniforms," she
said. "Subsequently, I heard from others who had been there,
that they'd seen them {the soldiers} take out cases."
   Although grateful that the museum was not summarily laid
waste -- the fate of most Kuwaiti institutions -- the
researcher said she feared for the artifacts, many of which
are centuries-old and extremely fragile. Transport across the
desert in an army truck could damage ancient objects, and the
drastic change in climate could further affect sensitive
manuscripts, wood carvings and textiles.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi officials in Washington deny any
knowledge that this highly organized act of plunder took
place.
   "We don't have the slightest idea about that," said
Mahasin Yono, an Iraqi Embassy representative. "We don't have
any information regarding that matter." Nor, by her account,
does her government have any official position on protecting
Kuwaiti-owned art. If, as seems likely, the methodical
plunder of the Kuwait collection was planned from Baghdad, it
amounted to a direct insult to the legacy of the recently
deposed Kuwaiti royal family.
   The Kuwait National Museum was established in 1983 by two
members of the al-Sabah family, Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed
al-Sabah and his wife, Sheikha Hussa Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah.
Eager to create an Islamic cultural repository in their
country, the couple began collecting artifacts from all over
the world in 1975 and assembled a portion of them as a museum
with the help of Marilyn Jenkins, a curator of Islamic art at
New York's Metropolitan Museum. In 1985, the al-Sabahs
sponsored archaeological digs in Egypt.
   Sheikha Hussa is now in Switzerland. Her husband's
whereabouts are unknown. And all that remains for sure of
their magnificent museum collection is a small group of
objects now bound for exhibitions in the U.S.
   More than 100 pieces from the Kuwait National Museum were
on exhibition at the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad during the
time of the invasion. On Dec. 9, they will arrive in this
country for "Islamic Art and Patronage: Selections From
Kuwait," at Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery.
   Ms. Atil, who is curator for the show, little suspected
two years ago that the objects she would select for the show
might be all that would survive of the collection. Some of
the museum's greatest treasures were left off the list
because they were "too fragile or too important," she said,
clearly regretting her earlier scruples.
   "There was one very important 14th-century luster-painted
vase that had the name of the maker as well as the patron,
that had been broken and repaired," Ms. Atil said. "I felt we
should not handle this more than necessary. There were some
marvelous intact early Islamic glass vessels that I felt were
too dangerous to include . . . We took ones that were already
broken and repaired, because if anything happened they would
break in the old place."
   However, other rare objects did make it out of Kuwait for
Ms. Atil's show, among them a 10th-century astrolabe, a
10th-century marble column from a Spanish palace, late 16th-
and 17th-century Indian jewelry, and 16th- and 17th-century
Turkish rugs.
   Other treasures from the Kuwaiti museum owe their survival
to "Romance of the Taj Mahal," an exhibition at the Virginia
Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond through Nov. 25 (the show
then moves to New York's Asia Society). Although the
exhibition features just six objects from the Kuwait National
Museum, they include some of its finer examples of
17th-century Indian jewelry: a 530-carat emerald necklace, a
gold-inlaid dagger with a jewel-encrusted scabbard, and a
delicate cameo carved from onyx and rubies.
   The fate of these artifacts is as uncertain as that of
Kuwait itself. Ms. Atil's exhibition, which will tour the
U.S. through April 1992, may then head on to yet unscheduled
exhibitions in Europe. But the emeralds and other objects
from "Romance of the Taj Mahal" may have to stay put, thanks
to a White House executive order that has frozen Kuwaiti
assets in this country, along with those of its occupying
power, Iraq.
   "They will come back to us for safekeeping if the
executive order has not been lifted," said Pamela Jenkinson
of the Los Angeles County Museum, which organized the Taj
show.
   As for the bulk of the Kuwaiti collection, the refugee art
researcher in London is keeping her fingers crossed that
Saddam Hussein will turn out to be a good curator. "It has
taken us so long to get it together and get it to the Middle
East," she said. "It's sad, but we'll just have to hope."
