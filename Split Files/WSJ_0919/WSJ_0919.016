   RICHARDSON, Texas -- Ericsson said it received orders
totaling $125 million for cellular switches and radio base
station equipment to expand Ericsson systems in six states.
   The telecommunications concern, a unit of L.M. Ericsson of
Stockholm, Sweden, said the orders include the installation
of switches and cell sites for Los Angeles Cellular Telephone
Co. and for Chicago-based Cellular One, a Southwestern Bell
Corp. company. In Florida, Ericsson will upgrade its APZ 212
processor and install cell sites for another company called
Cellular One, which is owned and operated by McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. Ericsson also will expand McCaw systems
in Sacramento, Calif., and Las Vegas, Nev., as well as
Cellular Telephone Co. systems in the San Francisco Bay area.
