   IRVING, Texas -- Integra-A Hotel &amp; Restaurant Co.said it
exercised its option to redeem its 13 1/2% bonds due 1993.
The owner and operator of hotels said it has issued $8.5
million in principal amount of the bonds. Integra said
redemption of the bonds is made possible by the agreement of
ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., a former Integra subsidiary, to
prepay $3 million on certain debts it owes to Integra.
   The bonds originally were issued as units of certain
Integra warrants that entitled the holders to buy 23.5 common
shares at 30 cents a share. Those warrants aren't being
redeemed and as of Sept. 30, they are transferable separate
and apart from the bonds, the company said.

   Bondholders other than Hallwood Group Inc., which holds
about $6.9 million of the bonds, will be paid in full in
cash, Integra said. For its holdings, Hallwood will receive
about $1.4 million in cash and an assignment from Integra of
certain remaining debts owed to the company by ShowBiz Pizza.
