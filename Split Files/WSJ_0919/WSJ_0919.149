   Anticipating increases in nonperforming loans and
securities losses, NewMil Bancorp of New Milford, Conn.,
parent of New Milford Savings Bank, said its board voted an
addition of about $700,000 to the loan-loss reserve,
equivalent to its expected earnings for its first quarter
ending Sept. 30.
   The board also suspended the regular quarterly dividend of
15 cents a share for "the foreseeable future."

   The move will increase NewMil Bancorp's total loan-loss
reserve to $2 million. New Milford Savings Bank operates 12
banking offices in northwestern Connecticut. NewMil Bancorp
had fiscal 1990 earnings of $3.8 million.
   The company said its decision was in response to a
regulatory opinion that its reserve was inadequate against
nonperforming loans, which include foreclosed loans and loans
for which interest payments are 90 days past due. In
addition, substantial losses are expected as the value of the
company's stock portfolio depreciates.
