   WASHINGTON -- Driven by soaring oil prices in the
aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, consumer prices
jumped 0.8% last month, the Labor Department reported,
confirming fears that the Middle East crisis would ignite a
surge in inflation.
   The rise in the government's consumer price index, which
measures the change in retail prices of an array of goods and
services, was twice July's increase and by far the biggest
monthly climb since a bitter cold wave sent consumer prices
soaring 1.1% in January.

   A 4.3% jump in energy prices was largely responsible, but
many economists said the report shows the nation has a
substantial inflation problem apart from the oil-price jolt.
Excluding energy, prices still rose substantially during the
month, climbing 0.4%. Leaving out food prices as well -- to
get what many economists consider the core rate of inflation
-- the index increased 0.5%.
   "What's upsetting is the core inflation rate -- ex food
and energy -- is now rising at an annual rate over 5%," said
Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh. "The danger is that the oil-price increase
spreads throughout the economy. This will push up the core
inflation rate as it gets passed through to an array of goods
and services."
   "I think this month's number is a very good
characterization of our inflation problem," said Joel Popkin,
an economist who used to oversee the compilation of the
consumer price index for the Labor Department. "Half of the
inflation came from the core rate -- problems we had before
the {Middle East} crisis, and half came from the invasion."
   The economy now faces the prospect of recession and the
highest inflation rate in nine years. Economists fear that
the burden of higher energy prices will lead consumers to
curb spending and lead businesses to pare investment,
pitching the already-shaky economy into a downturn.
   The economy's fate could depend largely on the Federal
Reserve, which for more than two years has been battling
inflation by keeping interest rates high. The central bank is
currently under pressure to lower interest rates to stimulate
economic activity by making credit cheaper. But analysts
believe the latest inflation figures -- combined with a
report last week that producer prices catapulted 1.3% in
August -- will make Fed officials reluctant to ease their
grip on credit.
   Meanwhile, more bad inflation news looms. Oil prices have
continued to rise on world markets in September, and some
businesses, including airlines, trucking companies and
petrochemical producers, have already announced plans to
raise prices.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, gaining control of a
large share of the world's oil reserves, crude-oil prices
shot up. At the same time, gasoline stations across the U.S.
almost immediately boosted prices, long before the jump in
crude prices worked their way through the system.
   According to the Labor Department, consumer gasoline
prices jumped 7.6% in August, while fuel-oil prices rose
11.9%.
   Largely because of the oil-price rises, an index measuring
transportation costs shot up 1.8% while an index gauging
housing costs jumped 0.7%.
   Medical-care prices continued their climb, rising 0.9% for
the second straight month and bringing their rise over the
past year to 9.5%.
   Food prices increased 0.3% after growing 0.4% in July.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
