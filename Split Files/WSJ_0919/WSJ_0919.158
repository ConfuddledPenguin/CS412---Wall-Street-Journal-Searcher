   Stanley Stahl agreed to Apple Bancorp Inc.'s plan under
which his tender offer would go forward, but the real estate
investor demanded that the New York bank holding company
rescind two expense reserves it set up last week.
   The parent of Apple Bank for Savings said Monday it would
drop its opposition to Mr. Stahl's $38-a-share tender offer
if the investor buys all shares tendered to him and holds a
majority of Apple's stock before its annual meeting Oct. 10.

   But Mr. Stahl noted that on Sept. 14, the bank set up a $2
million trust to pay expenses that its officers and directors
might incur in connection with litigation between the bank
and the investor. He said the establishment of that and
another $1.5 million trust violates a condition of his tender
offer.
   Apple said Mr. Stahl's "unwillingness to unambiguously
commit to complete his tender offer . . . demonstrates the
risk shareholders face if {his} nominees for the board should
take control" of Apple through the proxy contest he is
waging.
   Mr. Stahl's offer values Apple's nearly 4.6 million shares
outstanding at a total of $175 million. He has said he
controls about 76% of Apple, including his own stake plus
shares tendered under his offer.
