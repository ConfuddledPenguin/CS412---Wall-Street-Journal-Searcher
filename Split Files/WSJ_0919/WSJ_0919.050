   Los Angeles -- The choice of the site may have been
pragmatic -- a pleasant outdoor venue close to the freeways
-- but the symbolism seemed sublime. Here was the Classical
Dance Company of Cambodia, a superb young troupe that has
flowered from the devastation of the killing fields,
performing on the grounds of the Arboretum, a place of
institutionalized blossoming.
   Dancers' fingers unfurled like petals in time-lapse
photography. Dreamlike ballets unfolded on a bare stage: a
goddess and her handmaidens in a heavenly garden; a demon
disguised as a golden deer; a chaotic battle at night between
the hideously masked forces of evil and a trio of monkeys,
who were not only the good guys but the comics, scratching
their fleas and flinging themselves around in
lighter-than-air cartwheels.

   In reality, or rather in a glittering unreality that the
company sustained with nearly flawless concentration, the
stage didn't seem bare at all, but somehow graced by scenic
traces of royal courts, verdant forests and lush rice
paddies. And in that same unreality, it seemed as if these
dancers, with their towering headdresses, sumptuously
sequined costumes and radiant smiles, were the embodiments of
a cultural tradition that had been passed down to them,
through the long centuries, serene and undisturbed.
   Nothing could be further from the truth. Cambodia's
culture, along with much of its population, was murdered by
Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge regime during a four-year reign
of terror in the late 1970s, and many of these dancers were
malnourished orphans. When reconstruction began in 1980, the
nation's most urgent needs were food and shelter. Yet a new
School of Fine Arts opened during the same year in the
capital, Phnom Penh; this dance company is one of the
school's near-miraculous products.
   Its appearance here last week, as the crowning glory of a
delightful, if sometimes chaotic, Los Angeles Festival,
marked the first artistic exchange between the U.S. and
Cambodia since the Vietnam War. It also bespoke a remarkable
willingness on the part of the Vietnam-backed government of
Cambodia to support an art form that is elitist, to say the
least, and of royal descent; in olden days, court dancers did
double duty in the harem.
   The troupe's artistic director, 42-year-old Proeung
Chhieng, survived the terror as a farmer on a
concentration-camp farm, but both of his parents and 12 of
his 13 brothers and sisters were killed by the Khmer Rouge.
When I talked with Mr. Chhieng, I learned that dwelling on
the horrors of the past is not his style. Deflecting all
questions about life under the Pol Pot regime, he declared
himself delighted that his 36-person company had made it to
these shores, and had been received with open arms -- plus
gifts of food, money and warm clothing for the rest of the
tour -- by this city's large Cambodian community.
   Blowing his own horn isn't his style either. "I'm just a
grain of sand in the Sahara," he insisted earnestly. Then he
added that he'd been deeply troubled by the headline above an
article about him that ran on this page two months ago. And
what was the offending head? "The Man Who Saved Cambodian
Dance."
   "No one person could have done that," he said. "What we
have accomplished over the past 10 years is the work of so
many, many people together."
   Whether or not the editor's headline overstated Mr.
Chhieng's role, the article itself, written by Eileen
Blumenthal, a Rutgers professor of theater arts, amply
documented his dedication, from the time he was a child star,
living in the royal palace and dancing monkey roles, to his
first visit to New York earlier this year, in advance of the
company's tour.
   The only problem with the piece was that it never quite
explained how Mr. Chhieng or his company got here, since the
writer left out her own crucial role. When I talked with Ms.
Blumenthal, who has become the de facto producer of the tour,
I learned that her own dedication to classical Cambodian
dance began almost seven years ago, when she saw some shaky
amateurs going through the motions here in L.A. "It was clear
from their performance that whatever the tradition was, they
weren't able to maintain it," she says. "Still, I thought
this was a moving story, the destruction of an ancient
culture, and I decided to follow it up."
   That meant connecting with the Cambodian refugee
community, studying the culture, watching dances being taught
by aging teachers, and finally parlaying her academic
credentials into several visits to Cambodia, which had all
but excluded American citizens, including journalists, since
the Vietnam War.
   What she found, to her astonishment, was not the
destruction of a culture at all, but a small group of
surviving artists and teachers who were literally unearthing
precious traditions, passing them on to young students, and
thereby restoring them to the living stage.
   On her return to the U.S., Ms. Blumenthal spread the word
of her discoveries by writing newspaper and magazine
articles, and showing videotapes of the wonderful dance
troupe in Phnom Penh to some of this country's cultural
commissars. One result was an invitation to the troupe from
the Los Angeles Festival, followed by another invitation from
the Kennedy Center, followed by additional bookings and a
providential flurry of funds. "For a change," Ms. Blumenthal
said, "the gods decided they'd done enough to Cambodia, and
just for once they'd make everything work."
   Almost everything. Visas were slow to come from the U.S.
State Department, whose Cambodian policy remains in flux.
During two cliffhanging days late last month, the L.A.
Festival found itself squeezed between a charter airline,
which wanted advance payment for flying the dance company
from Phnom Penh to Bangkok, and the State Department, which
hadn't yet come through with the troupe's visas. Ten days
before the company opened here, the festival still was
worrying, via FAX, whether it could afford such an elaborate
event.
   Eventually, of course, the visas materialized, most of the
money did too (though one of the festival's checks briefly
bounced), and the artists wove their spell. In a festival
that celebrated far-flung cultures, the Cambodian dancers
served as a mesmerizing reminder that art is what some people
live for, and die for.
