   "Paradise Dream" is the torrid tale of Ivan and Anne
Marie, who fall in love while searching for an archaeologist
lost in a Hawaiian jungle. Their passion blossoms as they
overcome obstacles large and small, including a lost
corkscrew on page 102 that threatens to ruin their beach
picnic until Ivan, charmingly, pushes the cork into the wine
bottle with his car keys.
   At least that's in the "Paradise Dream" written for Ivan
and Anne Marie Avetissian of Moorpark, Calif. Mr. Avetissian
ordered the $150 deluxe edition of the novel to celebrate the
couple's fifth wedding anniversary. The corkscrew scene came
from the personal-romance questionnaire he faxed to the
author, Evelyn Brown.

   Ms. Brown has founded a publishing enterprise on the
observation that all happy couples are alike -- almost. Using
a computer program to fill in the blanks, Ms. Brown can crank
out a 100-page hard-cover novel in an hour. At last count,
she had rewritten "Paradise Dream" 1,500 times.
   Ms. Brown will cast a couple's names in the leading roles
for $45. For another $15 she'll throw in their hobbies, best
friends, favorite flowers, first kiss, pets, special songs,
and other details. In one version, a guest sits on a glass
table during the wedding reception: "The bride, groom and
their guests spent the rest of the day pulling glass shards
from Jo's derriere."
   Ms. Brown created Swan Publishing in 1987 out of a pair of
hobbies: computers and steamy novels. She enrolled in a
"Writing Romances" course and six months later completed "Our
Love," a tale about a newspaper reporter and an
allegedly-but-not-really-corrupt developer. Realizing that
the romance-fiction market was impossibly crowded, she
decided to cut out the middlemen -- agent, publisher and
supermarket -- and sell customized books directly by mail.
   From her garage in Placentia, Calif., Ms. Brown publishes
"Our Love," "Paradise Dream" and her latest, "Lotto Love," in
which a couple wins the lottery but then loses the winning
ticket. Customers can choose the sensuality level of their
text -- from the Candlelit Edition ("like the network
version") to the Burning Embers Edition ("the cable
version").
   Pleased customers have come back for second and third
orders, with a different paramour each time. "I had a guy
tell me all about his girlfriend, and (how) he loved her and
so on," Ms. Brown says. He later requested another novel --
for his wife.
