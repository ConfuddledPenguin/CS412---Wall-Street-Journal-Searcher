   NEW YORK -- Falling interest rates and slightly lower oil
prices helped stocks break a daylong slump to edge higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 3.96 to
2571.29, the second advance this week and the first
back-to-back gain since late August. Even so, 854 issues
declined on the New York Stock Exchange while only 626
advanced.

   Big Board volume of 141,130,000 shares was the highest
since Aug. 27, when the Dow Jones industrials rallied 78.71
points on volume of 160,150,000 shares.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
went up 0.83 to 318.60, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 0.26 to 174.88 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 0.68 to 295.08.
   Stock-index arbitrage buy programs, in which traders dart
between stocks, stock-index futures and options to profit
from fleeting price differences, contributed to a late surge
in volume and share prices. Program traders were active in
futures contracts on both the S&amp;P 500 index and the Chicago
Board of Trade's Major Market Index, dealers said.
   A big decline in Primerica helped keep the industrial
average down for much of the session, despite gains in
International Business Machines.
   But a jump in Treasury bond prices and a weaker crude-oil
market helped stocks climb out of an earlier loss of more
than 34 points. Crude oil for October delivery fell 22 cents
a barrel to $33.41. Long-term Treasury bonds recovered losses
to finish about unchanged to yield 9.06%.
   Traders said institutions showed a greater desire to buy
and sell, compared to recent sessions. Some 3,102 blocks of
10,000 shares or more traded on the Big Board yesterday,
compared with 2,502 the day before.
   But the pickup wasn't enough to convince many observers
that the market would soon break out of recent doldrums. "One
can definitely note a lack of enthusiasm," said Trude
Latimer, a market strategist at Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co.
   Daniel Williams, head trader at Dillon Read, said, "It was
another one of those wait-and-see type of days."
   Disappointment with reports on August consumer prices and
the July trade deficit weighed on the market as the session
began, traders said. Although the 0.8% jump in last month's
consumer price index was in line with forecasts, prices
excluding food and energy went up 0.5%, heightening inflation
worries. And the trade deficit of $9.33 billion for July was
wider than expected.
   Stocks skidded to session lows as rumors swept through the
market that Chase Manhattan was having difficulty placing
commercial paper, a form of short-term financing. Chase
denied the rumors, but its stock fell 7/8 to 15 in trading of
1.6 million shares.
   But in the afternoon, a sharp decline in the federal funds
rate -- the lending rate banks charge each other on loans of
their reserves -- sparked speculation that the Federal
Reserve might have eased monetary policy. Federal funds
traded as low as 6.25%, well below their recent 8% level.
   "The market seemed to latch onto the Fed stories," said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical research at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. As Treasury securities recovered
early losses, the rebound "took the stock market up with it,"
he said.
   Optimism about a possible agreement to reduce the federal
budget deficit also lifted the market, traders said. Late in
the session, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said the
budget talks are moving into "a new stage" as congressional
leaders try to reach a compromise on whether to cut the
capital-gains tax.
   Federal National Mortgage Association, the most active Big
Board issue, tumbled 1 1/2 to 27 1/2 on 2.3 million shares
after its chairman and chief executive officer, David
Maxwell, said he will retire Jan. 31. Mr. Maxwell said Fannie
Mae faces a "great challenge" as the result of "a very
tumultuous time in the economy," which is likely to bring
changes in the U.S. financial system.
   Salomon jumped 1 to 25 7/8 on 748,100 shares, about double
its normal volume, following a positive story by Cable News
Network. Salomon, whose Phibro Energy unit refines and trades
oil, has benefited for weeks from surging oil prices. James
Hanbury, a Wertheim Schroder analyst, says Salomon stock
could hit 30 within six months; he says investors have
"undervalued" the firm's oil refineries.
   Primerica tumbled 2 5/8 to 23 1/8 on 1.5 million shares.
Industry observers attributed the decline to concerns about
the company's consumer finance operations and recent reports
that New Jersey insurance regulators are seeking to stop its
Transport Life unit from doing business in the state.
   International Business Machines climbed 2 1/8 to 107 1/4
as 1.7 million shares changed hands. Among other blue-chip
consumer stocks, Coca-Cola rose 3/4 to 41 1/4, Procter &amp;
Gamble added 3/4 to 76 3/8, McDonald's rose 1/2 to 26 7/8 and
Philip Morris added 1/4 to 45 1/8 on 2.3 million shares.
   UAL soared 7 5/8 to 105. A group of unions at its United
Airlines unit will meet with banks this week to discuss a
new, reduced buy-out offer of $175 to $180 a share, which
will likely involve participation of an unnamed foreign
airline.
   Motorola dipped 1 1/2 to 61 3/4. Analysts at PaineWebber
and Prudential-Bache Securities lowered their 1990 earnings
projections on the company, and PaineWebber also reduced its
1991 estimate.
   Unisys dropped 5/8 to 7 1/4 and traded as low as 6 3/4, a
new 52-week low, amid renewed speculation that the company's
dividend may be in jeopardy. Its board has a dividend meeting
scheduled for next week.
   Vista Chemical tumbled 2 1/8 to 25 1/4. Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
analyst Charles Rose said the company is facing cash-flow
problems which will put its dividend in question.
   Itel dropped 7/8 to 14 3/8. The company completed a
repurchase of 4.7 million common shares from Henley Group
under the terms of a previously reached agreement.
   Abbott Laboratories rose 1 1/4 to 41 5/8. Cowen &amp; Co.
repeated its buy recommendation on the stock, citing Abbott's
selection of Thomas R. Hodgson as president and chief
operating officer.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.02
to 319.69. Volume totaled 10,890,000 shares.
   Mission Resource Partners skidded 1 7/8 to 8 1/4. The
partnership said it is holding talks with an independent oil
and gas company for the sale of all of its remaining assets,
which would result in the dissolution of the partnership.
