   EMBARRASSING? Alarming? Whatever you call it, initial
results of a much-touted program to draw some of the best
students into manufacturing are revealing.
   Two years ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and 11 major manufacturers began a five-year, $46 million
effort to educate a new generation of manufacturing leaders.
The first class of 20 Fellows just finished the two-year
program.
   So where did they land? A startling 35% went with
consulting firms -- not manufacturers; McKinsey &amp; Co. landed
three.
   Money appears to be the principal factor. The median
starting salary for those who went with consultants was
$70,000, while for those opting for manufacturing concerns,
it was $55,000. Just nine of the students went with
sponsoring companies, including Digital Equipment (which
hired three) and Motorola (two).
   "To some, this may be discouraging news," says Linda
Stantial, career-development director of MIT's Sloan School
of Management. She notes that several students who chose
consulting will deal with factory issues.
   The results jolted the sponsors. Some of the companies
"think that if they're putting in this kind of money, they
should have some of these students," says Thomas W. Eagar, a
professor in the program. "But these aren't indentured
servants."
   MIT has begun hammering the message that Fellows are
expected to join manufacturers. And future Fellows may not
get a free ride but a loan that wouldn't have to be repaid if
they join a manufacturer. Sponsoring companies are expected
to send as Fellows more of their own engineers, who likely
would return.
   Among the students, many believe "manufacturers will have
to narrow the pay gap to entice them," says one Fellow. Ms.
Stantial contends manufacturers face a "tough challenge"
ahead to "potentially change their career paths, compensation
schemes and organization attitudes . . . their corporate
culture."
                                                                                                       

   Eager to Boost Morale?
   Just Spin the Wheel
                                                                                                       

   MEDIATECH, a Chicago company that duplicates
videocassettes, has tried with mixed success the traditional
methods for motivating employees, including contests and
parties. Officials believe they have hit a winner for
improving morale: the corporate lottery.
   Unlike in state lotteries, Mediatech's 350 employees don't
risk their own money. The company puts $250 weekly into the
prize pot. Each Monday, a wheel is spun to determine if there
will be a lottery that week. If the wheel stops on Lottery,
the drawing is at 4 p.m. Friday with payroll check numbers
used to pick winners; if No Lottery comes up, the money
accumulates until the next week.
   Mediatech officials claim the 16-week-old lottery has
greatly improved morale and productivity. "Certainly,
attendance is better on Friday afternoons," says Sterling
"Red" Quinlan, a Mediatech vice president.
                                                                                                       

   Retiree Benefit Cuts
   Won't End Soon
                                                                                                       

   RETIREES, take note. You haven't seen anything yet in the
rush by employers to shift more of their health-care cost
burden to retirees. An unpublished study by Hewitt Associates
suggests that over the next five years, a growing number of
companies plan to take far more serious actions to stem
mounting retiree health costs than steps taken in the past
two years.
   By 1995, 62% of 463 large and medium-sized firms surveyed
by the Lincolnshire, Ill., benefits consulting firm say they
will "definitely consider" raising insurance-premium
contributions of retirees, and one in 20 will mull
eliminating the retiree medical plan altogether. During the
past two years, about 35% of the companies raised the premium
contribution, but few terminated plans altogether.

   It Still Isn't Dad
   At Home With Sick Kids
                                                                                                       

   IT'S NO SECRET that when work-family conflicts arise,
working mothers shoulder most of the responsibilities. A
fresh Labor Department survey underscores just how much of
the burden working women continue to bear, despite all the
talk of changing gender roles in society.
   During an average week last year, 6.6% of married women
employed full time missed work. That was considerably above
the 4% absence rate for men. The gap is much wider for
working couples with children under 17 years old. Among
working mothers with preschoolers, the rate was 11.5%, triple
the 3.8% rate for their spouses. For couples with children
aged 6 to 17, the rate was 6% for women, 3.7% for men.
   The survey also indicates that when working women with
preschoolers miss work, the odds are nearly 2-to-1 that the
reason isn't their own illness. These mothers are most likely
to encounter scheduling problems with child-care
arrangements.
   In contrast, when their spouses miss work, the odds are
6-to-4 that it is because they are ill and not because they
are staying home with a sick child.
