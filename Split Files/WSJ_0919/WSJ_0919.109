   DETROIT -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing $40 billion of Ford Motor Co.'s debt for possible
downgrade.
   Moody's review was prompted by the softness in the U.S.
auto market, said Carol Verscell, the rating agency's
assistant vice president. She said Ford remains secure in the
high-grade area, and will be reviewed again in the next
several weeks.

   Ford has lowered its estimate for overall car and truck
sales in 1990. Ford had forecast the U.S. market at 14.3
million cars and trucks in 1990, which is down from its
original estimate of 14.5 million vehicles. Ford predicted
the sluggish sales would continue into the first half of
1991.
   Moody's said it also will assess the potential capital
requirements of Ford's wholly owned subsidiary, First
Nationwide Bank. About $1.7 billion of First Nationwide's
debt is being reviewed, Moody's said.
   Ford yesterday said Moody's action "isn't warranted," and
questioned the rating agency's decision to review its debt in
light of "what may prove to be a short term situation." Ford
said it will discuss the action with Moody's officials.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ford closed
at $34.25, up 50 cents. The announcement came less than 30
minutes before the stock market closed.
   Among the ratings now under review by Moody's are the
double-A-2 rating for Ford's senior debt and double-A-3 on
the company's subordinated debt.
   Moody's also is reviewing ratings for First Nationwide
Bank, including the single-A-1 rating on its senior debt and
the single-A-2 rating on its subordinated debt.
