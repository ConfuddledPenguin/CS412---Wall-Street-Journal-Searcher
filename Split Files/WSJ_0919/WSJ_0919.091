   NEW YORK -- As over-the-counter stocks generally go
nowhere, investors are beginning to separate the strong from
the weak in the young biotechnology industry.
   Biotech stocks were little changed yesterday as the Nasdaq
Composite Index eased 1.90 to 372.21, a 0.5% decline, while
volume grew to 115.1 million shares from 94 million Monday.
But as biotech has emerged as one of the hotter stock groups
this year, investors have flocked to the bigger companies and
generally shunned the gleam-in-the-eye enterprises without
products for sale.

   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the biggest 10 biotech
companies in a group of 20 have eased only 3.5%, far less
than the 14% decline for the smaller half of the group
tracked by Denise Gilbert, a San Francisco biotechnology
analyst for County NatWest Securities. Meanwhile, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 11%.
   For the year to date, the top half of the 20 biotech
stocks followed by Ms. Gilbert rose 34%. That compares with a
flat performance by the smallest 10 stocks.
   Biotech industry executives now expect sales to reach $75
billion by the end of the decade, rather than $100 billion,
as forecast a year ago.
   "Financing expectations are half of what they were a year
ago," said G. Steven Burrill of Ernst &amp; Young in San
Francisco, at a news session yesterday describing the
accounting firm's fifth annual survey of biotech executives.
The survey was completed before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
rattled the financial markets and before federal regulators
unexpectedly delayed recommending approval of two products
developed by Immunex and Cetus. Both events shut the
near-term window for public financing of biotech stocks, he
said.
   Only larger companies with the best prospects of having
their products approved are finding financiers on Wall
Street. Those companies also are having the most success in
striking strategic alliances with other biotech and
pharmaceutical companies, according to the survey. As the
industry increasingly stratifies, "you're seeing the large
companies pull away from the pack and become the dominant
part of the industry," Mr. Burrill said.
   "The lower tier is in `biotech purgatory,'" says Ms.
Gilbert. "They'll either move up or move out." On the other
hand, the upper crust will move up as their products move
closer to market.
   Ms. Gilbert's top-tier list includes Amgen, Cetus,
Centocor, Chiron and Biogen as well as Genzyme, Genetics
Institute, Immunex, Xoma and exchange-listed Genentech. She
says there is an "upper crust" among second-tier companies
that stand the best chance of obtaining financing, including
Cytogen, Synergen, Repligen and California Biotechnology.
Other companies in her second tier are Immunomedics, NeoRx,
Oncogene Science, T Cell Sciences and Genex.
   Ms. Gilbert says she has "buy" recommendations only on
those companies that already have reported profits -- Amgen,
Genentech and Genzyme.
   VeriFone, the day's most active stock, lost nearly half
its value in a 5 1/4-point dive to an all-time low of 7 5/8,
less than half its initial offering price of $16 a share in
March. Monday, VeriFone said third-quarter results are likely
to fall below analysts' expectations. Recent estimates have
been between 25 cents and 27 cents a share for the Redwood
City, Calif., provider of credit-card handling technology,
according to Zacks Investment Research Inc. Morgan Stanley
analyst L. Keith Mullins slashed his estimate for VeriFone's
third-quarter earnings to 13 cents from 25 cents and
downgraded his investment opinion to "hold" from "buy."
   After the close, VeriFone said it agreed to provide credit
card authorization to PBS National Datacast Inc., a unit of
Public Broadcasting Service. Nearly 4.5 million VeriFone
shares changed hands yesterday, 37 times average volume. The
stock traded as high as 26 earlier this year.
   Oracle Systems rose 1/4 to 7 1/8 in heavy trading after
the software maker confirmed reports of layoffs and top-level
management changes in the wake of its first quarterly loss
ever.
   News from the technology sector aided several stocks.
   Sun Microsystems' computers will be used in a "Photo CD"
unveiled yesterday by Eastman Kodak Co. The system puts
snapshots on compact discs for television viewing. Sun rose
7/8 to 29 3/8.
   Apple Computer decided to remain neutral in the rivalry
over the Unix operating sytem, which was originally developed
by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. Apple said it will join
two rival groups that have been debating how to turn the Unix
software into a computer-industry standard, rather than take
sides. Sun is a partner with AT&amp;T in Unix International.
Apple eased 3/8 to 33 3/8.
   3Com gained 1/4 to 7 1/8 after the Santa Clara, Calif.,
maker of computer communications systems said it began
shipping Microsoft's LAN (local-area network) Manager 2.0
system with its own network software. Microsoft rose 1 to 61
1/2.
   Trading also was heavy in Ashton-Tate, which rose 1/8 to 7
7/8 on 2.4 million shares, and Chips &amp; Technologies, which
eased 1/4 to 11 on more than one million shares.
   MCI Communications was unchanged at 32 1/8 after the
Washington, D.C., long-distance carrier said it agreed to buy
Over Seas Telecommunications Inc., an Alexandria, Va.,
provider of satellite digital communications overseas. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Anemic earnings outlooks felled several stocks. Stokely
USA tumbled 3 1/8 to 13. The Oconomowoc, Wis., company said
it expects a 5% to 10% drop in sales will result in a 50%
decline in earnings for the second quarter, ending Sept. 30,
compared with year-earlier earnings.
   Analysts International skidded 1 7/8 to 12 3/8 after the
Minneapolis computer programming concern said its 1991 growth
rate will fall short of its 20% target. The company also said
it expects earnings in the first quarter, ending Sept. 30,
will be flat, although revenue and earnings for the full year
should set a record.
