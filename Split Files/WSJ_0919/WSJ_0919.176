   TORONTO -- Stelco Inc. said it will slash its quarterly
dividend in half, cut salaries and reduce spending on capital
projects as a result of the recession in its steel markets
and the effects of a seven-week strike by the United
Steelworkers of America.
   The Toronto steel manufacturer said it will cut its
regular quarterly dividend payment to 12.5 Canadian cents
(U.S. 10.8 cents) a share from 25 Canadian cents a share, the
first such cut in nine years. The last time it cut its
dividend, Stelco was also in the midst of a lengthy
steelworkers' strike.

   Company officials said that the decision to cut the
dividend, payable Nov. 1, could save Stelco about C$4.4
million (US$3.8 million). They declined to estimate savings
from cutting salaries and capital spending.
   The company had planned to spend C$185 million on capital
projects during 1990, a significant portion of which was
accounted for by a project to reline one of its blast
furnaces. That reline, begun July 1, has been halted by the
strike, Stelco said.
   A spokesman for Stelco said salaries will be cut
"progressively" as long as the strike continues. He declined
to identify the size of the initial reductions.
   About 10,000 Stelco employees have been on strike since
Aug. 1. Talks are reported to be continuing under a news
blackout.
   John Allan, chairman and chief executive officer of
Stelco, said in a statement that the company's management is
reviewing all of Stelco's businesses "with a view to
implementing additional cost containment measures including
consideration of various strategic structural changes
directed to improving shareholder value."
   A Stelco spokesman declined to discuss what those
structural changes could include.
