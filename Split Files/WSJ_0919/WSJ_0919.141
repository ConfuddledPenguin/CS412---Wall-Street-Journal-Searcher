   Bertelsmann AG said it sold 49% of its book club in Italy
to publishers Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera Editori. Terms of
the transaction weren't disclosed.
   The West German publishing company said it could expand
the market share for Euroclubs Italia through Rizzoli's
influence in Italy.

   Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest operators of book
clubs, said its Euroclubs Italia book club had 700,000
members in 1989 with sales of 75 million German marks ($48.5
million). Walter Gerstgrasser, Bertelsmann managing board
member, said the company will retain 51% of the book club as
well as its current management.
   Last year, Rizzoli had the equivalent of 3 billion marks
in sales and controls about one-fourth of the Italian book
market, according to Bertelsmann.
   A spokesman for Bertelsmann said the company has had "good
experience" with partnerships established with other book
clubs in France and Britain.
