   Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding
company, is facing a difficult period as a string of units
are expected to report disappointing first-half earnings.
   The Belgium holding company's recently restructured
minings and metals unit, Acec-Union Miniere, reported
first-half net income of 3.7 billion Belgian francs ($116.1
million). Analysts estimate that a year-earlier figure would
have been about 6.3 billion Belgian francs.

   Acec-UM said revenue remained at about the same level as a
year ago.
   In 1989 Acec-UM accounted for 57% of SGB operating profit.
SGB's other main units are also expected to report lower
first-half profits, pulling down the group's total earnings,
which will be released Oct. 3.
   Some analysts, however, are optimistic about SGB's future.
"Their long-term future isn't too bad," said Guy Lerminiaux,
of Deeway Servais &amp; Cie, a Belgian brokerage firm. "They've
got some interesting projects, and I think their management
is doing a good job."
