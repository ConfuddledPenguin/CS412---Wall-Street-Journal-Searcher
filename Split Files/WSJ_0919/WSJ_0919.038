   This is a saga that demonstrates the excesses of a
misconceived and misapplied regulatory program along with a
group of individuals who were bent on exploiting these
excesses, all to the detriment and ultimate demise of
Lincoln. It is abundantly clear that Lincoln was in an unsafe
and unsound condition to transact business and that
plaintiffs did in fact engage in numerous unsafe and unsound
banking practices. Accordingly, this Court concludes that the
Bank Board acted properly in placing Lincoln first in
conservatorship and then in receivership.
   The Bank Board's case is fairly straightforward. It
asserts that Lincoln engaged in a number of imprudent
transactions in order to improperly upstream monies to ACC,
its parent, which was experiencing financial difficulties.
                                                                                                       

   The Tax Sharing Agreement
                                                                                                       

   The Bank Board is absolutely correct in its analysis of
the tax sharing agreement. Under the tax sharing agreement,
Lincoln transferred to ACC over $94 million in so-called tax
sharing payments when in fact Lincoln on a stand-alone basis
essentially owed no taxes. Plaintiffs used the concept of tax
sharing as a way of dipping into Lincoln's coffers and taking
money which under no circumstances were plaintiffs entitled
to have. Although ACC owned 100% of the stock of Lincoln,
this did not give ACC license to strip Lincoln of its funds,
particularly because the funds upstreamed emanated from the
savings of individual investors which were insured up to
$100,000 per account by the Federal Government.
   But there is much more skullduggery that has taken place
in this case. The tax sharing agreement was merely the
mechanism used to permit the impermissible taking that
occurred. What the defendant has next alleged and proven is
that the plaintiffs engaged in additional unsafe and unsound
practices for the purpose of creating bogus profits in order
to justify the remittance of monies from Lincoln to ACC under
the "tax sharing agreement."
   The main purpose of certain of these transactions was to
create paper profits in order to "window dress" the financial
statements of Lincoln and its parent ACC and to provide the
accounting basis for the upstreaming of funds from Lincoln to
ACC.
                                                                                                       

   The Wescon Transaction
                                                                                                       

   The evidence shows that on March 31, 1987, a Lincoln
subsidiary sold 1,000 acres of raw land in Hidden Valley to a
company called West Continental Mortgage and Investment
Corporation (Wescon). The terms of the sale involved a cash
down payment of $3.5 million, along with a nonrecourse note
for the balance of $10.5 million for a total sales price of
$14 million.
   Since Lincoln's pro rata cost of the property sold was
only $3 million, it was able to book a gain of $11 million
along with $250,000 in accrued interest. In accordance with
the "tax sharing agreement," ACC was able to upstream to
itself from Lincoln $4.4 million, or 40% of the $11 million
gain.
   Wescon never made a payment against the balance on the
outstanding note. Wescon was a company of little means. It
had a net worth of only $31,000, and it really had no
intention of developing the property. Fernando Acosta, the
President of Wescon, was quite blunt in his testimony at the
hearing. He stated that his company was acting only as a
"straw" for Mr. Garcia, the head of E.C. Garcia &amp; Company.
   It is clear, and this Court finds, that the sole reason
for the Wescon transaction was to enable the ACC complex to
record an $11 million profit and thus allow ACC to improperly
take $4.4 million from Lincoln. Here we have a sham
transaction from the start with the identity of the real
party in interest being shielded from those who must exercise
appropriate oversight of the transaction. Because of the use
of a straw buyer the accounting audit trail does not disclose
all the salient points associated with the transaction.
   Moreover, when the entire series of transactions between
the Garcia and ACC complex of companies is reviewed, it
emerges that in fact the money for the down payment actually
emanated from Lincoln itself.
                                                                                                       

   The Philip Gordon Transaction
                                                                                                       

   Here, the transaction involved an exchange of like
property and as such it is inappropriate to recognize a gain.
   This is another example of ACC officials crafting
transactions for the sole purpose of being able to book and
record paper profits and upstream monies from Lincoln to ACC.
The Court rejects ACC's feeble attempt to attribute a valid
business purpose to this set of transactions. The record is
clear that the transactions involved a flat-out exchange of
property at inflated prices for which no gain should have
been recognized and no tax payment made by Lincoln to ACC.
   The Wescon and Gordon "sales" represent only two of ten
"creative" transactions involving Hidden Valley parcels. In
total, the ten sales resulted in the booking by Lincoln of
$82 million in net income of 68% of Lincoln's total 1986-1988
pre-tax income of $120.8 million. Under the tax sharing
agreement by applying the 40% tax rate, ACC was able to
appropriate (42) to itself from Lincoln almost $33 million in
cash from these transactions.
                                                                                                       

   Conclusions of Law
                                                                                                       

   Because of the interests at stake in this case plaintiffs'
allegations of an impermissible constitutional taking of
plaintiffs' property, the Court permitted the parties the
widest latitude to develop a full and complete record. What
has emerged is not a pretty picture. It is abundantly clear
that ACC's officials abused their positions with respect to
Lincoln. Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a
looting of Lincoln. This was not done crudely. Indeed, it was
done with a great deal of sophistication. The transactions
were all made to have an aura of legality about them. They
even entered into a so-called formal tax sharing agreement in
order to claim they had the approval of the regulatory
authorities for this phase of their illicit activities.
