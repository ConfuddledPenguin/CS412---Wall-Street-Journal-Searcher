   NEW YORK -- The average interest rate rose to 7.98% at
Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial
paper, or corporate IOUs, from 7.9397% at last week's sale.
   Bids totaling $405 million were submitted. Accepted bids
were at 7.98%.

   Citicorp also said the average rate rose to 7.928% at its
$50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.924%
at last week's sale. Bids totaling $375 million were
submitted. Accepted bids were at 7.928%.
   Earlier this month, Citicorp said this would be the last
such auction of commercial paper. Growth in consumer
deposits, the bank's balance-sheet management and its direct
placement of commercial paper have eliminated the need for
the auctions, Citicorp said.
