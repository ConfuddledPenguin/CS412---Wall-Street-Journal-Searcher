   WASHINGTON -- T. Boone Pickens is stepping down as
chairman of United Shareholders Association, the
shareholder-rights advocacy group he founded four years ago.
   Mr. Pickens, chairman of Mesa Petroleum L.P., said that
the organization needs "new blood to get to the next plateau"
and emphasized that he will remain committed to USA. Mr.
Pickens will be succeeded as USA chairman Oct. 1 by Charles
Cox, a former member of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, who is senior vice president of Lexecon Inc., a
Chicago economic consulting firm. Mr. Cox left the SEC last
year, after six years as a commissioner and a prior stint as
chief economist.

   USA, which claims 64,000 members in 38 chapters, has been
active in soliciting SEC proxy action to enhance shareholder
rights. The group has fought against management bonuses like
"golden parachutes," and against what it called "excessive
management entrenchment techniques."
