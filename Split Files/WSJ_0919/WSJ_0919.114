   NEW YORK -- Telerate Inc.'s financial information service
was stopped for more than two hours yesterday due to a power
outage at its main computer operation in Jersey City, N.J.
   Telerate service was knocked out at around 7:15 a.m. EDT
because of an explosion at a Public Service Electric &amp; Gas
Co. facility that serves the Telerate building in Jersey
City, according to a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., which
owns Telerate.
