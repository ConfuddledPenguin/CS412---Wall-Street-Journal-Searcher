   France, for the past three centuries, has fascinated the
world. From the refinements of Versailles to the last word in
bloody revolution, from high fashion to high-tech in the
shape of the world's fastest train, it has proved
unpredictable, but interesting. And then, there is that
famous way of life, happily blending -- so we are often told
-- sexual liberation and gastronomical bliss.
   None of this has escaped Richard Bernstein. The former
head of the Paris bureau of the New York Times, Mr. Bernstein
was not only interested in France and the French, he also had
access to people and places well beyond the ordinary
traveler's ken; and the result, surprisingly, is a hymn of
love. Of course, like the good journalist he is, Mr.
Bernstein retains his objectivity: Shortcomings are listed as
well as achievements; the peculiarities of the French
political system -- essentially an elective monarchy -- are
carefully analyzed; and the descriptions of the French on
holiday are enough to make the blood run cold.

   Still, "Fragile Glory: A Portrait of France and the
French" (Knopf, 349 pages, $24.95) is a paean to the
landscapes, the villages, the traditions and the people of
France. Better yet, Mr. Bernstein set out to disprove a myth
he encountered early. "The French," he notes, "like to think
of themselves as just a bit inscrutable, especially to
outsiders." He shows us just how the French differ from one
another and from us, and why.
   The place to start, contrary to tradition, is not Paris.
Most Parisians, still today, have roots deep in the
countryside; and Mr. Bernstein's summary of "la France
Profonde" (deep France) is nothing short of superb as he
takes us around the country, from village to village and
region to region. His descriptions of the landscape often
verge on the lyrical: "The Luberon Valley in Provence," he
writes, "is an arid region of pastel colors, of mottled pink
land, of olive and fig groves and vineyards that turn scarlet
in the autumn, the ensemble of colors mingling harmoniously
like those on the printed cotton cloth manufactured in the
region." Even better, he then goes on to interview and
observe people with a mixture of sympathy and detachment; and
the conversations he has with farmers and town dwellers alike
combine to offer the reader an unusually vivid and precise
picture of rural France.
   The same is true of Paris. But while Mr. Bernstein's
fondness for the city is evident, he does not allow it to
sway him. "In some ways, Paris's long moment has finally
passed," he writes, accurately, as he goes on to note the
city's lack of "creative audacity." And when it comes to
judging its intellectuals and their productions, he is quite
rightly pitiless, mentioning, among other factors, the
importance of subjects the French themselves call
"franco-francais", Franco-French -- i.e., of no interest to
anyone anywhere else.
   All this, however, just sets the scene: From there, the
book goes on to the French character, with its sometimes
appealing, sometimes maddening characteristics. What Mr.
Bernstein calls the "R5 complex" (after the small Renault) is
a hair-raising description and a brilliant analysis of the
Jekyll-and-Hyde-like transformation the French undergo when
driving a car. "Gallic Shrugs" offers a sharp and amusing
account of French manners. "In Praise of Frivolity" is a
mouthwatering trip through all the good things (to eat and
otherwise) to be found in France. And in passing, Mr.
Bernstein dispels a few myths, among which the best known is
that the French are anti-American. In fact, as he accurately
points out, the French now are frantically pro-American and
prove it constantly, imitation being the sincerest form of
worship.
   Nor is the dark side of French politics ignored: There is
a substantial chapter on the "political class" and the
population's relationship to it, a compound of respect,
cynicism and outright derision. Add to that Mr. Bernstein's
explanation of the role played by the few hundred graduates
of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and the frequent
lack of responsiveness of the government to its own people
becomes clear; so does its tendency to continue its mistakes
well past the point of absurdity.
   Darker subjects are tackled as well: the continuing role
of "raison d'Etat", for instance, the "reason of State" which
enables the government to get away with a variety of scandals
in the name of national security: The sinking of the Rainbow
Warrior, the anti-nuclear Greenpeace ship bombed in Auckland
by the French secret services, is a perfect case in point.
And, of course, Mr. Bernstein discusses the rise of racism as
sponsored by Jean-Marie Le Pen and his infamous National
Front; but he is quick to point out that the anti-racist
response has been massive and vigorous.
   This is all very well, but there is more: Dispassionate,
if fond, and enormously informative, "Fragile Glory" is more
than yet another book about France and the French. Although
nothing like a guidebook, it offers a fascinating, thorough,
and eminently useful explanation of the country and the way
it works; reading it will unquestionably make a trip to
France richer and more enjoyable.
