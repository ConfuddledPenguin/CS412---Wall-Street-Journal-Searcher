   WASHINGTON -- The slowdown has finally reached the
economy's biggest, most resilient sector: services.
   For the past year and a half, as U.S. manufacturers shaved
workers from their payrolls, businesses that provide services
had continued to expand vigorously, adding new employees at
an average of 171,000 a month in 1989. While increasing
numbers of Americans began to think twice about buying a new
car or new home, they continued to spend heartily on an array
of services from telephone calls to airline travel.

   That's changing.
   Except for the health field, job growth in service
industries was virtually flat last month, according to the
Labor Department. Service-sector production has risen just
2.5% in the year ended in July after rising 4.2% in the
previous year, according to an index compiled by the
Coalition of Service Industries, a group formed by a number
of large, service-oriented companies. Growth in personal
spending on services has tapered off since the end of last
year, Commerce Department figures show.
   "The service-producing sector has also weakened after many
years of strong growth during the expansion," the
commissioner of labor statistics, Janet Norwood, told
Congress earlier this month.
   Services are never as prone to economic ups and downs as
manufacturing, construction and other segments of the economy
that are more sensitive to interest rates. People are more
likely to forgo a new color TV or a new house than a haircut
or car insurance, economists explain.
   But the decline in housing and manufacturing has "gone on
for long enough and there are enough uncertainties in the
picture that consumers are starting to identify other areas
where they cannot spend," says Paul McCracken, an economist
at the University of Michigan.
   "Those who are depending on services to forestall
recession should not rest easy," Steven Strongin, an
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, wrote
recently.
   Urbach, Kahn &amp; Werlin, an accounting firm based in Albany,
N.Y., hasn't replaced any of the 17 people who've left the
firm's nine offices this year. "In the past, when the economy
was better, we would have immediately rehired and probably
put on additional staff," says Steven Fischer, Urbach's
president.
   Like that of many firms that provide services to other
companies, Urbach's business is slowing because its clients'
business is slowing. "Many of our clients are not
experiencing growth, they are not having a good year, not
looking for acquisitions and not expanding their business,"
Mr. Fischer says. "As they suffer a bit, we suffer a bit."
   Other industries are victims of increasing consumer
caution. Many retailers are trimming holiday buying plans.
Mr. McCracken notes that tourism in his state of Michigan is
significantly down. USAir recently announced layoffs of
thousands of workers. Because fewer people are booking
cruises and tours, Frommer Travel Service in Washington,
D.C., has decided not to replace a three-day-a-week employee
who left the firm two months ago. "Basically we are not
overwhelmed at all" with the remaining staff, says Larry
Frommer, the agency's president. If the employee had left a
year ago, he said, the firm would have had to replace her.
   "This is the kind of thing, I think, that is not
immediately visible," says Norman Robertson, chief economist
at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "If you have a major layoff at
a manufacturing facility, that gets the headlines. If
McDonald's is laying off two people, if the local department
store isn't hiring this year, that doesn't get headlines."
   Many economists say the weakening in the service sector
isn't surprising and was bound to happen. "When the whole
economy slows down you know what you get: everything slowing
to the point where manufacturing is actually decreasing and
services are growing less than they used to," says Charles
Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. "I don't think that's anything but typical of an
economy that's growing sideways."
   But the fact that one of the most vibrant parts of the
economy during the nearly eight-year expansion is now dimming
underscores the fragility of the U.S. economy. And it has
worrisome implications for large numbers of Americans, for
the service sector is huge. It employs more than seven of
every 10 American workers and accounts for 68% of the value
of the nation's output. "That's the sector now that's really
become the source of income and wealth generation for an
overwhelmingly large portion of the U.S. economy," says
Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
   Most analysts, however, stress that the service sector is
still growing, and probably will continue to expand even if
the overall economy sinks into a downturn. After all, even
during the deep recession of 1981-82, service employment
continued to edge up.
   "I think it is reasonable to expect that sluggish growth
in the service sector would finally happen, in terms of what
is going on in the economy. However it is still growth," says
Margaret Wigglesworth, executive director of the Coalition of
Service Industries.
