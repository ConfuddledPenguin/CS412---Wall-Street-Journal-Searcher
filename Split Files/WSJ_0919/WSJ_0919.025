   When John M. Hennessy was named chief executive of CS
First Boston Inc. last fall, he became the man charged with
making a success of the ballyhooed merger of First Boston
Corp. and its European affiliate. The combination was meant
to create the first "truly global" investment bank for the
1990s. Mr. Hennessy, a suave man with years of accomplishment
in Europe, would embody the new era.
   He seized the reins fast. Within a few months, he bumped
aside the newly named chief executive of CS First Boston's
big American unit, where profits were weak, to run the whole
show himself.

   Then he rattled the U.S. unit, First Boston Corp. He axed
440 employees, or 10% of the work force. And, in a sweeping
move, he ousted the entire top tier of bond traders,
replacing them with a rough-and-tumble team of outsiders. The
latest management shift came Monday, when First Boston's head
of stock trading was forced to resign. The moves have created
turmoil in the ranks.
   But they haven't repaired the bottom line. First Boston's
total profits are stuck at a level far below those of rivals
Salomon Inc., Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co.
   Now the 54-year-old Mr. Hennessy clearly is under pressure
to produce. After a charmed 16-year career at First Boston,
Mr. Hennessy suddenly finds himself facing one of the
toughest turnaround jobs on Wall Street, as more people
question the wisdom of the merger that created CS First
Boston. Mr. Hennessy is "under the gun," says Lawrence
Eckenfelder, brokerage analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Two weeks ago, just eight months after Mr. Hennessy took
over day-to-day control of the First Boston Corp. unit, he
surrendered that authority to Archibald Cox Jr., a man who
had worked for the firm for only four months.
   Last week, Mr. Hennessy's decision-making power was
further eroded. An internal memo said a committee of top
executives, including Hans-Joerg Rudloff, powerful head of
the European unit (Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston),
will meet more often and have more day-to-day say about how
CS First Boston is run.
   Is Mr. Hennessy in trouble? His bosses in Switzerland deny
it. "I have full confidence in Jack," says Rainer Gut,
chairman of Credit Suisse, which effectively controls CS
First Boston. "It was Jack who found Archie Cox with the
design of having him grow into a major role." Mr. Gut does
confirm Credit Suisse's displeasure with First Boston's
earnings, remarking that "they are probably as unhappy as we
are that they're not making better money."
   Mr. Hennessy himself says he never intended to run the
U.S. unit for long, although he acknowledges he told
employees when he shoved aside William Mayer as the unit's
chief that he could picture himself holding the post for as
long as two years. And some people on Wall Street say that
Mr. Hennessy has shrewdly elevated Mr. Cox, putting him in a
position of either fixing up First Boston or taking the blame
if he can't.
   Many of First Boston's troubles are clearly not of Mr.
Hennessy's doing. All along Wall Street, a slowdown in
business stemming from the October 1987 stock-market crash
has depressed securities underwriting and mergers and
acquisitions, costing many high executives their jobs.
   And just as Mr. Hennessy took over a year ago, the market
for junk bonds collapsed, plunging into turmoil the highly
leveraged retailing empire of First Boston client Robert
Campeau. The junk collapse left First Boston with big "bridge
loans" to corporate clients that couldn't be refinanced,
including $250 million to Campeau's troubled department
stores. In all, First Boston is stuck with a huge $1.1
billion in bridge loans -- the biggest exposure on Wall
Street.
   The aggressive Mr. Hennessy, fresh from a glittering
six-year stint in Europe, might seem just the person to cut
through this thicket. A square-jawed man who likes to call
himself "a tough Irish kid from Boston" -- he actually hails
from a suburb and is a Harvard graduate -- he decorates his
office with two fully outfitted statuettes of Samurai
warriors. Nearby, a plaque quotes a favorite verse that
begins: "People don't want to be managed. They want to be
led."
   But for all his forcefulness, critics fault Mr. Hennessy's
handling of some of First Boston's root problems. Meanwhile,
his tough, take-no-prisoners approach -- cutting staff,
criticizing performances and sometimes threatening to
"replace everyone" -- is taking a toll on morale.
   People had become "too comfortable" at First Boston during
the good years, Mr. Hennessy says. He suggests that any
grumbling in the ranks stems from people who can't cut it.
"Now it's tougher -- more like the Marines," he says.
   The problem is that First Boston seems to be pinned down
on the beach. Once an underwriting powerhouse, First Boston
has dropped in the rankings. It garnered only $89.5 million
in underwriting fees in this year's first half, down 22% from
a year before, a significantly steeper drop than on Wall
Street overall, according to Securities Data Co.
   And in private stock and bond placements, First Boston,
after leading all firms for two straight years, has stumbled
badly. Through June 30 it handled just $2.9 billion in
private placements, for a 5.2% market share and No. 7
ranking. That's down 62% from the $7.7 billion and 9.4%
market share in the year-earlier half, according to IDD
Information Services.
   First Boston isn't in the dire straits that Shearson
Lehman faced early this year, when Chairman Peter Cohen was
ousted. It has continued to thrive in big global merger
deals, for example. But last year CS First Boston recorded a
meager profit of just $11 million, while rival Salomon made
$470 million and Morgan Stanley $443 million; privately held
Goldman Sachs' profit is thought to have been comparable to
those.
   This year, CS First Boston's profit is up only slightly.
Holding it down is the need to continually set aside more
reserves for the huge backlog of bridge loans. CS First
Boston was forced to take more than $200 million in reserves
last year for bridge loans, and is taking a similar amount
this year under pressure from credit-rating agencies.
   The rating agencies don't rule out a future downgrade of
First Boston's debt if its bridge exposure isn't drastically
reduced. "They can't keep this crap on the books forever,"
says Jeffrey Bowman, vice president at Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. "We've been disappointed in the way the firm has tried
to work down their bridge-loan exposure. They should be more
aggressive."
   He adds: "Their direction is very short-term. I don't see
any long-term strategic plan yet."
   Says David C. Batten, a former CS First Boston managing
director who helped build the firm's capital-markets
business: "There have been no strategic initiatives in the
time Jack {Hennessy} has had the job -- yet the world has
changed dramatically." Mr. Batten, who quit First Boston
several months ago because of what he calls Mr. Hennessy's
lack of leadership, says: "No question that Jack inherited an
institution with real problems, but he's done very little to
shore up those problems."
   Others say Mr. Hennessy is trying to make the best of a
bad situation. Harvard Business School professor and Wall
Street watcher Samuel Hayes says the securities industry's
recession has undercut "a lot of different sectors {First
Boston has} depended on," including junk bonds and corporate
mergers. "So therefore it was inevitable there was going to
be a downturn in its fortunes."
   "I've always admired Jack Hennessy as a leader; he was the
one who turned around the operation in London and reaffirmed
their pre-eminence in that marketplace," Mr. Hayes says.
"It's hard for me to conclude that this is a problem that is
related to a lack of firm leadership," the professor says.
   Mr. Hennessy certainly hasn't been shy about shaking up
the firm. He replaced the top bond traders with a well-known
team led by William Voute and four others formerly with
Salomon Brothers. The bitterness among other First Boston
traders boiled over as one victim of the shakeup, David
Bunting, "retired" at age 47. As the former head
government-bond trader walked off First Boston's trading
floor, he was given a rousing standing ovation by other
traders. (First Boston says such ovations, at least small
ones, are a tradition.)
   But Mr. Hennessy has also alienated some top executives
with what they say is a Machiavellian management style. In
March, as the firm's results continued to slip, chief
financial officer John Toffolon Jr. walked into Mr.
Hennessy's 43rd-floor corner office to ask Mr. Hennessy if
his position was secure, associates say.
   Mr. Hennessy assured Mr. Toffolon he was doing a good job,
these people say. But at the same time, Mr. Hennessy told top
CS First Boston executives that he had lost confidence in Mr.
Toffolon and was actively looking to replace him. A few
months later, Mr. Toffolon resigned. He was replaced by
Shearson Lehman executive Robert Raziano, an expert in
payroll slashing. Messrs. Toffolon and Hennessy declined to
comment.
   Some employees say Mr. Hennessy has a habit -- they're not
sure whether it is intentional -- of sowing rumors and unrest
among his lieutenants. Out of earshot of an executive,
staffers say, he will remark that "I've been hearing" that
the person is in trouble or "doesn't have the confidence of
his people."
   Some top executives were taken aback at Mr. Hennessy's
behavior at an early-1989 meeting with a corporate-image
consultant and First Boston officials including then-chief
executive Peter Buchanan. Mr. Hennessy, though heir apparent,
wasn't yet in charge. But when Mr. Buchanan left the room,
say people who were there, Mr. Hennessy announced: "Don't
worry about what Peter has to say. His vote isn't going to
count."
   Mr. Hennessy denies saying such things. "That's not my
style," he says. "It wouldn't make any sense."
   Some First Boston executives accuse Mr. Hennessy of
scattershot execution of his game plan. Critics in the firm
say Mr. Hennessy rushed into the firm's newfound emphasis on
"relationship" banking, for instance. That's the old-style
Wall Street practice -- making a comeback at many investment
banks -- of forging strong ties with particular clients,
rather than chasing business opportunities as they arise.
   Mr. Hennessy says he hired Mr. Voute after the two men,
over drinks, got to talking about the renewed emphasis on
relationship banking. "Gee, it looks like the '60s," Mr.
Hennessy says Mr. Voute told him. Mr. Hennessy liked the ring
of that; Mr. Voute and his gang were hired.
   Still, with all the talk of relationship banking, there's
a hitch: Few First Boston executives have been on the road to
visit corporate clients at their offices all year, top First
Boston officials say.
   Associates of Mr. Hennessy say he has ignored pleas to
establish a world-wide strategy for stock trading. Top First
Boston officials have repeatedly told Mr. Hennessy the firm
needs to coordinate its equity activities around the globe,
including sizing up which markets look best, and where big
bets should be made. But he hasn't yet taken any action, the
executives say. Nor has he committed much of the firm's
capital in a significant way toward investing in "distressed"
securities in hopes of finding turnaround situations, as
other Wall Street firms have been doing.
   "We haven't taken full advantage of cross-border trading,
tying things all together," Mr. Hennessy concedes. But he
says Mr. Cox, with his equity expertise, is planning a
strategy for world-wide stock trading set to start Nov. 1.
(Mr. Cox will do it with a new First Boston equity-department
head, James Gantsoudes, a Dillon Read veteran who Monday
replaced the ousted Curtis Welling.)
   As for distressed securities, Mr. Hennessy says the firm
has been hesitant to commit much money to it because of its
heavy bridge-loan exposure. "We're staying fairly close to
shore on that," he says. But he contends the firm has made
money trading in such securities, adding: "We're making
continuous bets, but not huge bets."
   There is another source of friction Mr. Hennessy still
must find a way to bridge: the longstanding schism between CS
First Boston investment bankers on either side of the
Atlantic. Mr. Hennessy's relationship with the aggressive Mr.
Rudloff in Europe remains competitive.
   A New York-based managing director focusing on
international business, Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, says he saw
opportunities for the firm in Eastern Europe late last year.
Mr. Kuczynski had initial success in Hungary, helping take
the state-run Malev airline private, but he suddenly pulled
back from the rest of the region after Mr. Rudloff made it
known that his people were running the entire European show.
"He wanted his own team," says Mr. Kuczynski.
   Mr. Rudloff is feared in New York. Executives there were
buzzing last week over comments made by Mr. Rudloff after the
internal announcement of the beefed-up executive committee.
Credit Suisse is a "well-oiled machine," Mr. Rudloff said in
a Reuters wire-service report from London. But "our cousins
in New York may need a little more attention." A startled Mr.
Hennessy complained to Mr. Rudloff in a phone call from his
office: "Hans-Joerg, I would have put it differently."
   Last year, the First Boston Corp. unit in the U.S. didn't
make money, but the European operation did. That's something
the Europeans make sure the New Yorkers don't easily forget.
   Mr. Hennessy says the firm's overall performance is the
important thing. "We're like Ford," he says. "Right now, Ford
USA isn't doing as well as Ford Europe. And that's the same
here."
   But what startled many employees about the internal
announcement was Mr. Hennessy's apparent defensiveness about
his power. "Decisions will be made by consensus," Mr.
Hennessy said, "but I will retain the ultimate power of
decision."
   First Boston's new chief, Mr. Cox -- an old friend of Mr.
Gut, the Credit Suisse chairman, from their days commuting to
New York together on the Long Island Rail Road -- is seen on
Wall Street as a warmer figure than Mr. Hennessy. The
6-foot-7 Mr. Cox was known for plopping down in the middle of
the trading room to chat when he was head of Morgan Stanley's
international operations in London. After first joining CS
First Boston earlier this year, he helped map a three-year
strategy aiming for a return on equity of 20%. (Morgan
Stanley has averaged a 31% return the past five years.)
   Mr. Hennessy says he is unconcerned about whether his own
job could be on the line. "I'm not worried, it doesn't affect
me," he says. "Push me out, kick me upstairs, whatever," he
adds, holding his hand over his heart and smiling. "I can now
relax, frankly, because we have a team in place that's
certainly the best in the business."
