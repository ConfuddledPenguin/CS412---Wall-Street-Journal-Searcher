   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded the ratings on about $1.1 billion of debt of Oryx
Energy Co., Dallas. The rating agency cited diminished
financial flexibility resulting from a previously reported
announcement by the company that it would buy back, using
debt, about $1 billion of common stock.
   Moody's noted that the oil and gas exploration concern's
financial leverage is already high as a result of a past
purchase of $1.1 billion of reserves and properties.
