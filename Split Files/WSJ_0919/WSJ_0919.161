   NEW YORK -- Two New York Bancorp Inc. directors who won
their seats after a proxy fight are charging the rest of the
board with refusing to allow them to help supervise the
holding company's bank.
   The charges are in a suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court
by the company's largest shareholder, Patrick E. Malloy III,
who has a more than a 9% stake, and an attorney, Michael A.
McManus, who has less than 1%. Mr. Malloy also is president
of Malloy Enterprises Inc., a Sag Harbor, N.Y., real estate
and investment firm.

   In January, Messrs. Malloy and McManus won a proxy fight
for two board seats. They took the seats after settling New
York Bancorp's lawsuit challenging the shareholder vote in
the fight.
   New York Bancorp, the Queens, N.Y., parent of Home Federal
Savings Bank, declined to comment on the suit.
   The suit charges that the plaintiffs have been unable to
help oversee Home Federal because the bank's affairs are
dealt with only by directors of the bank, not by directors of
the holding company. The lawsuit charges that the holding
company's board departed from its routine by not naming
Messrs. Malloy and McManus to Home Federal's board.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, New York
Bancorp shares fell 37.5 cents to $11.375.
