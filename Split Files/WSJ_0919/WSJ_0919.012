   CLEVELAND -- Agency Rent-A-Car Inc. said it will
repurchase as many as one million shares of its common stock
outstanding through a series of open-market transactions.
   The concern said the current market price of its stock
doesn't reflect the company's inherent value. Agency had
approximately 25.3 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 1.
