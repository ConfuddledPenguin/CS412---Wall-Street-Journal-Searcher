   WASHINGTON -- Iraq has significantly increased the number
of troops and tanks it has deployed in and around Kuwait, but
the bigger force still appears to be in a defensive posture,
the Pentagon said.
   Iraq now has 360,000 troops and 2,800 tanks in occupied
Kuwait and nearby areas of Iraq, said Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams. Those estimates are up from the Pentagon's
estimates of 265,000 troops and 2,200 tanks two weeks ago.

   Mr. Williams said that while there are more Iraqi tanks in
the area, some of them have been pulled back to positions
farther away from Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, where
some 130,000 American soldiers are massed along with forces
from several other nations. Still, the higher overall troop
and tank estimate is significant, because it shows a steady
growth in the size of the force Iraq could immediately use if
hostilities erupt.
   At the same time, the Bush administration sent a series of
mixed signals to Jordan, a neighbor of Iraq that has
maintained good ties with Baghdad since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. The State Department reproached Jordan
for playing host to a conference last weekend of Arab
radicals that openly called for attacks on American targets
and the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   "We were surprised and dismayed that this conference took
place, and we have told the Jordanians so," said Margaret
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. "We want to work
with Jordan during and after this crisis in the Gulf. Hosting
the conference is very hard for us to understand."
   At the same time, the State Department reported that
Jordan still appears to be receiving about 40% of its oil
from Iraq, a technical violation of the international trade
embargo. But the department seemed sympathetic toward
Jordan's need for Iraqi oil. Ms. Tutwiler emphasized that
Jordan had reduced its dependence on Iraqi oil from 90%
before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and she said she hoped
Jordan could cut its use of Iraqi oil further as it gets new
economic aid from other countries.
   Separately, the Pentagon disclosed that American sailors
stopped and boarded a Soviet cargo ship as it carried goods
to the Jordanian port of Aqaba. American forces determined
that the cargo wasn't bound for Iraq and let the ship travel
on to Jordan, the Pentagon said.
   The U.S. also announced that it is sending three military
aircraft to fly relief missions to help refugees from Iraq
and Kuwait who have fled to Jordan. The planes will carry in
blankets, cots and other supplies for the refugees and carry
some of the refugees to their homelands.
   The increase in Iraqi troop strength in and around Kuwait
appears to be at least partly a result of a slight
restructuring of forces by Iraq as it consolidates its
positions in the area. Mr. Williams, the Pentagon spokesman,
said that the increase was caused partly by the addition of
troops to "round out" Iraqi units sent in earlier and partly
because infantry units, which use more troops, are being
moved forward as armored units are moved back from the Saudi
border.
   "There has been a gradual buildup in Iraqi forces since
this operation began," Mr. Williams said. "There has been no
sudden surge. It's certainly a continued buildup."
   Separately, Central Intelligence Agency Director William
Webster warned in a New York speech that Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein has "recently revived" his ties "to those
Palestinian terrorists who have gone after Western
interests."
   Mr. Webster said "what intelligence has tracked and
reported in the past year about Iraq's involvement in
terrorism concerns us." He said American intelligence has
determined that Saddam Hussein now "has both strong ties to
Palestinian terrorists and an elaborate network within his
own intelligence service capable of carrying out terrorist
attacks."
   The CIA chief specifically cited Saddam Hussein's ties to
terrorist groups led by Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas. Iraq's
renewed ties to terrorists had been reported, but Mr.
Webster's is the strongest on-the-record confirmation that
U.S. intelligence is concerned about it.
   Mr. Webster also disclosed that the CIA has set up special
task forces to work on the Persian Gulf crisis, and is
monitoring Iraqi troops, ships, terrorists and "the condition
and status of the foreign hostages being held in Iraq and
Kuwait."
