   Near the northern border of Saudi Arabia, a young Saudi
air-force captain looks around for eavesdroppers, then lowers
his voice. "The Iraqis are real fighters, not like the
Americans," he says. "They fought through eight years of heat
and dust and blood, and they're tough, I'm telling you."
   Just 35 miles to the north, Iraqis are moving position
daily, sliding up and down the border in a game of nerves
with the several thousand Saudis, Egyptians, Syrians,
Moroccans and Kuwaitis who move to match them, like pieces on
a vast chessboard.

   The American forces are positioned hundreds of miles to
the rear of these forward posts. If war comes, this flat and
featureless desert plain will be its first killing field and
the odd assortment of Arab and Islamic forces massed here
will be its likeliest first casualties. Eventually, troops
promised by Arab and Islamic nations could match the scale of
the U.S. buildup in Saudi Arabia. But such forces have been
slow to deploy, and so far the purpose of those who have
arrived seems more symbolic than strategic. "It's important
in the Middle East that Arabs see their own people being
given a responsible part of the task," says Don Kerr, a Saudi
Arabia expert in London. "Being at the front line -- the
tripwire, if you like -- is a very responsible role."
   By pushing these troops to the front line, Iraqi soldiers
are compelled to stare into the faces of their Moslem
brothers rather than at the massed might of the U.S. military
machine. But the mirror works two ways here, and the long
desert days have given Arab troops on this side of the border
plenty of time to contemplate combat with their Iraqi
counterparts. A tour of these northern border positions
reveals widely differing views -- between senior commanders
and junior officers, between Egyptians, Saudis and Kuwaitis
-- about exactly what they have come here to do, and what the
outcome might be.
   This is mirage country, where the landscape is softened
only by illusions. Tricks of light deposit shimmering sheets
of water in the distance, and set army trucks afloat on them.
Apart from man-made intrusions such as tents and sandbagged
artillery, the only relief for the eye is an occasional
camel, marking the horizon like a squiggle of Arabic
calligraphy.
   The young Saudi air-force captain feels at home in this
bleakness, a lot more at home than he did a few weeks ago in
Alabama, where he completed advanced training in flying
Blackhawk helicopters. In his U.S.-style desert camouflage,
there is little to distinguish him from an American soldier.
But there is an edge to his voice, and it betrays an
uneasiness with his new American brothers-in-arms.
   "Americans lead very closed-in lives," he says. In
Alabama, he recalls, "someone asked me if Saudi Arabia was in
California." He wonders if such people know what they are up
against, thousands of miles from home. And most of all, he
wonders whether he doesn't have more in common with his Iraqi
enemy than with his American ally.
   The Americans, he says, "are complaining about the heat
even though the weather these days is nice for this desert.
They say they want to fight and get it over with. Me, I don't
want it, and {the Iraqis} don't want it. My family's village
is just a few miles from the Iraqi border. We are the same
religion, same language, same people. Believe me, I know
them, and I know that fighting them won't be so easy." The
captain's great hope is that the Iraqis will have the courage
to overthrow their leader, and that the Americans will have
the patience to wait for that to happen.
   Saudi ambivalence about fighting alongside Americans has
its faint echoes in the Saudi government's official rhetoric.
Describing the foreign troops in Saudi Arabia, government
statements invariably use the formulation, "Arab, Islamic and
friendly forces," which, given the current ratio of U.S. to
Arab and Islamic ground troops (about five to one) is about
like trying to hide the bulk of the White House behind a
spindly minaret. "It's nonsense," admits one Saudi official.
"Eventually I think it will find its way into the garbage
along with all the rhetoric about `fraternal Iraq.'"
   While some Saudis worry about the tenacity of Americans,
their own forces -- untested in war -- are perhaps a greater
unknown. These include an army of 38,000 and a National Guard
of 56,000 currently swelling with new recruits. Just a
hundred years ago, the very thought of Arabia's desert
warriors -- who never succumbed to colonial conquerers --
inspired dread in their neighbors. The journals of the
British explorer, Charles Doughty, are full of the dire
warnings he received from Arab friends on the eve of his 1877
journey to the region. "If one goes into Arabia, he should
carry his shroud under his arm," said one. Warned another:
"Why cast your life away? You know them not. But we know
them. The Bedouins are fiends."
   Today's highly urbanized Saudis, although well-trained and
equipped with the best that money can buy, are two or three
generations removed from the hard men who waged tribal war on
these sands. At a mobile field hospital set up behind the
front lines, a Saudi dermatologist named Abed al-Twerki lists
photodermatitis -- otherwise known as sunburn -- as among the
biggest health problems so far. An Arab, he says "is no
different to an American. If you take people from the cities
and you bring them to the desert, every day you'll get cases
of headache, sunburn or stomach pains" until they adjust.
   Further north, at a Saudi tank-brigade encampment, the
officers' quarters occupy a large, fabric-lined tent, fitted
out in the traditional style of a desert sheik with oriental
carpets and bolsters. A TV set sits on an ice-filled cooler
alongside a touchtone phone. "You can dial America direct
from here," a Saudi soldier boasts. Lunch -- fried chicken,
grilled quail, rice, french fries, salad, shaslik, stuffed
courgettes and 7-Up -- arrives by helicopter from the giant
northern base, King Khalid Military City, and is dished out
by Filipino waiters.
   The Saudis have some 15,000 of their own troops in the
northern region. Alongside them are 2,000 Egyptian commandos,
1,200 Moroccans, 3,000 Syrians, 2,000 men each from Pakistan
and Bangladesh and around 5,000 Kuwaitis. Some of the Islamic
nations also have troops elsewhere in Saudi Arabia -- all
massed against much larger forces across the border. "We came
here because we are ready for them; numbers don't make a
difference to us," says Brig. Gen. Turki al-Nefie, commanding
the Saudis' 20th Mechanized Brigade from a sandbagged bunker.
   But Western military analysts aren't as confident. "With
the exception of Egypt and Syria, who have armor on the way,
everyone else is pretty cosmetic," says a Western diplomat in
Riyadh. The Saudis have beeen "inundated" by offers of troops
from small Third World countries, he says. "But if combat
breaks out we are talking about a desert tank campaign shades
of World War II in Libya, and while token armed forces might
have an important political role, in a military sense 1,000
Bangladeshi riflemen aren't the answer to that."
   The Syrians, despite the size of their commitment, have
proved the most publicity-shy of all. About once a week,
Saudi officials organize visits to the various Arab armies,
ferrying journalists north by transport planes, buses and
four-wheel-drive vehicles. According to the Saudis, the
Syrians have sent special-forces commandos dispatched from
assignment on the Golan Heights, Syria's contested border
with Israel. "The Syrians just took their position today, and
they're too busy for us to see them," explains a Saudi escort
officer, as a press bus accelerated past what appeared to be
a Syrian encampment adjacent to the Saudi front line. "But
that's exactly what you told us last week," an American
journalist grumbles.
   Saudi officials say they have designed a command structure
that quarantines Syrians and other Arab forces from U.S.
control. The degree of coordination between Saudis and
Americans, and between the various Arab forces, remains
unclear. Brig. Gen. al-Nefie says "there are no Americans at
all" in his northern command area, but adds that an American
officer occasionally visits his forward command post. As for
the nearby Syrian forces, he says, "when we have neighboring
units we always coordinate between commanders to cover gaps."
   But barriers to coordination in combat are potentially
nightmarish here. Syrians fight according to Soviet doctrine;
Saudis use U.S. tactics. Saudis and Moroccans speak such
different Arabic dialects that they can barely understand
each other. Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Arab troops have to
communicate with each other in English. The Saudis shrug off
such difficulties, saying that liaison officers are working
out any problems.
   While the Arab and Islamic forces haven't brought the
high-tech weaponry of the Americans, many have come armed
with battle experience. The Moroccans have fought a long
desert war with Polisario guerrillas in the Western Sahara,
and the Egyptians and Syrians have bitter experience in
battle against the Israelis. Some of these veterans, having
seen the U.S. driven from Vietnam and Lebanon, doubt American
staying power in a vicious contest with war-hardened Iraqis.
   For the most part, American troops are having little
contact with their Arab counterparts, even on bases far from
the border. Some seem torn between the urge to get to know
their Arabian hosts and the fear instilled by years of seeing
Arabs as terrorist threats to U.S. military personnel. Just a
few yards separate American and Saudi crews maintaining their
own air force's fighter planes in a vast hangar at King Abdul
Aziz Airbase. But the work schedule is too grueling to allow
for chat, and off duty the only point of contact is the
airbase gym. So far, says one 22-year-old airman, most U.S.
personnel haven't been allowed off-base, and that suits him
fine. He fears becoming a terrorist target if he ventures
into town. "I'm planning to go home," he says.
   At the northern front, it is the senior officers --
Kuwaiti and Saudi -- who are most eager to fight Iraq. "For a
military man like me, I wish we could transfer the order from
defense to offense -- waiting isn't good," says Gen. Mohammed
al-Sheri, logistics commander of the northern sector. He, at
least, isn't awed by Iraqi fighting prowess. The general is
among the few who have had contact with Iraqi deserters.
After a conversation with three of them, he says, "I know
their morale: They are dead." He says their rations were
mainly dirty flour and their gas masks were so old and
ill-fitting "they wouldn't even keep dust out, much less
chemicals."
   He describes his own troops' morale, by contrast, as
"wonderful," despite a barrage of Iraqi propaganda carefully
aimed at both Arab and American troops. Iraqi radio
broadcasts attempt to both goad the Americans with tales of
Gulf shieks seducing American women and reassure them that
Iraq respects Christians. But the broadcasts also tell Arab
troops of U.S. soldiers cavorting with Arab women inside the
gates of the holy mosques at Mecca and Medina and deride
Christians as infidels. Since many of the Arab troops speak
fluent English, such contradictory broadcasts create hilarity
rather than the hoped-for horror.
   Yet Gen. al-Sheri says such efforts shouldn't be entirely
shrugged off. "Iraqis are good at propaganda," he says. "I
can admit it because we were deceived by them." During the
Iran-Iraq war, he says, "I took from my own salary to give to
the Iraqis, and I saved from my own food." Just six months
earlier, he says, he proudly shook Saddam Hussein's hand when
the Iraqi leader was an honored guest at King Khalid Military
City. "He said, `We now are building a very strong army, and
it's good for the whole Arab nation.' And we believed it
all," says the general, shaking his head.
   Egyptians, too, strongly supported Iraq during the Gulf
war. The government sent arms and some Egyptians even
volunteered to fight alongside Iraqis. At a camp guarded by
stern troops armed with fixed bayonets, Col. Abdulrahaman
Mohammed Sayyed heads 2,000 Egyptian commandos, some of whom
saw combat against Israel in 1973.
   But the Egyptian commander isn't forthcoming when asked
how his men see their current enmity with Iraq. At first, he
tries to brush off the question by saying none of the men
under his command volunteered to fight with Iraq against
Iran. Asked again, he replies that "we are not fighting now;
we are defending the kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Questioned
further, he states: "The unit here is made up of professional
career soldiers who, once given orders, will execute the
orders regardless who the enemy is."
   Outside, as troops file out of their tents for weapons
drill, a young captain named Mohammed Adel Fettah bluntly
states that his mission is defensive. "We as Arabs and
Moslems under Islam know that no Arab should attack an Arab
brother, no Moslem should attack another Moslem. That's all
there is to it," he says. "We won't make war on Iraq, but if
they enter Saudi Arabia, then we will defend it."
   As the Arab forces wait in the desert for a battle many
hope won't happen, the Saudis face the growing task of
meeting all the logistical needs for the assortment of
forces. Fortunately, says Gen. al-Sheri, some bought their
own spare parts, so the Saudis don't have immediate problems
chasing supplies for the Syrians' Soviet weapons or the
Moroccans' Spanish-made vehicles. But some odd orders are
being filled: the Egyptians report that the Saudis somehow
are supplying them with their national dish -- "molokia" -- a
slimy green vegetable scooped up on Arabic bread. While the
Egyptian troops don't share the Americans' degree of
discomfort with the desert, they are equally beset by
boredom. To fill free time, they play soccer and, as the
comedians of the Arab world, concoct daring political jokes
about the current sorry state of Arabian politics.
   Asked to share one, an Egyptian colonel, Wagdu Abde,
glances toward the nearby Saudis and declines with a grin.
"If you come to Cairo I will tell you," he says.
