   National Semiconductor Corp. said it signed a long-term
agreement to supply Conner Peripherals in San Jose, Calif.,
with integrated circuits for its disk-drive products. The
company declined to disclose the value.
   The agreement covers a range of devices from mixed analog
and digital disk-drive circuits to digital-to-analog
converters, Applied System Integrated Circuits and memory
devices. It formalizes a relationship between the two
companies dating back to Conner Peripherals' original product
development efforts, a spokeswoman for National
Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said.

board-level connnectivity products. Conner Peripherals makes
and markets disk drives for workstations and portable and
desktop computers.
