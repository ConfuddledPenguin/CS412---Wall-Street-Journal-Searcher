   Boeing Co. said its de Havilland unit received an order
valued at about $22 million for two Dash 8 series 300
airplanes from Schreiner Airways B.V., a division of
Schreiner Aviation Group of the Netherlands.
   The twin-engine turboprop planes will be delivered within
the next few months, Boeing said. Schreiner Airways provides
regional commuter service, charter service and other aviation
services.

   Boeing continues to discuss the possible sale of the de
Havilland unit with Aeritalia of Italy and Aerospatiale of
France. A team from the two potential buyers is expected to
continue reviewing de Havilland's operations for another few
weeks, said a de Havilland spokesman in Toronto. Boeing is
based in Seattle.
