   Yesterday Charles Keating Jr. was booked in Los Angeles on
criminal-fraud charges involving his failed Lincoln Savings
and Loan. On Monday, regulators at the Resolution Trust Corp.
filed papers showing that they plan to declare insolvency of
another thrift, Franklin Savings Association, ignoring a
federal court order to return it to its owners. Our
regulators, it seems, can't tell foxes from chickens, let
alone sheep from goats.
   To be sure, regulators suffered a decade of intimidation
by the likes of Jim Wright or the five Senators upon whom Mr.
Keating conferred notoriety. This climate allowed the Charley
Keatings and Donald Dixons to run rampant through the S&amp;Ls.
Yet now free of interference, the regulators are creating a
climate of bloody-mindedness, jeopardizing otherwise safe
S&amp;Ls, exposing the government to potentially explosive legal
liabilities, running up the cost of the S&amp;L fiasco and doing
more than anything else to slow the economy to the brink of
recession.

   Anyone who doubts that regulators have run berserk should
read the extracts alongside from the opinion in the Franklin
case by Federal District Judge Dale Saffels, himself former
head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of Topeka. And
especially to contrast it with the opinion in the Lincoln
case by Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin, former
enforcement head at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In dispatching Mr. Keating's brazen suit to reclaim Lincoln,
Judge Sporkin has no trouble citing chapter and verse of
deception and what he calls "skullduggery."
   The regulators are unable to distinguish this from the
Franklin case, in which Judge Saffels finds a good-faith
management, indeed one that bailed out a sick S&amp;L by
developing a sophisticated strategy of financial hedges. The
judge finds that Franklin has not been endangered by its
management; its hedges "have not caused any economic losses
to the institution." Rather, it's been endangered by
regulators pursuing an abstruse argument over hedge
accounting, debating over the extent to which losses on hedge
instruments can be amortized against unrealized gains on
other instruments against which they were hedged.
   The intensity of this pursuit is frightening. The
regulators had previously blown the Silverado and Centrust
cases, and weren't about to let another one get away. The
examiner pounced on Franklin's 10K, having only read one such
document in his life. The regulators' general counsel set out
a strategy of "pointing a finger" at the thrift's management,
and then gave instructions not to follow up management's
report that its bond trustee would not regard certain filings
as grounds to exercise claims to collateral. Elsewhere in the
opinion, the judge repeatedly complains that documents
favorable to Franklin were missing from the record.
   On our reading of the record, Judge Saffels was generous
in his finding that regulators had not acted in bad faith.
Yet they obtained a stay of his ruling from a higher court
and reseized Franklin. Now, without waiting for a full
hearing of their appeal, they've moving for insolvency.
   The Franklin case, moreover, is hardly the only case of
regulatory excess. In Oregon, Judge Owen Panner last week
issued a final judgment in favor of the owners of Far West
Federal. He said that the government's plan to renege on its
1987 agreement with the owners would violate their right
against takings. Dozens of similar cases are in various
courtrooms across the nation.
   This goes far to explain why the cost of the thrift
problem keeps rising. Regulators have themselves decimated
Franklin, and probably other institutions as well. Because
the government has insured the depositors, taxpayers will
have to foot the cost of this further damage. Indeed,
ultimately they may have to foot it twice. If the bureaucrats
again lose in court, taxpayers will be stuck with a
multimillion-dollar claim for compensation from owners and
bondholders.
   Naturally, too, frightening cases like Franklin frighten
the rest of the industry. Why should even the best manager
buy into a possibly salvageable thrift if he has to subject
himself to such regulators? How can present thrift
managements move at all?
   The same regulatory climate is spreading throughout the
economy. In particular, jitters have spread to the commercial
banks, whose regulators have decided to avoid an S&amp;L problem
at whatever cost. With everyone afraid of taking a bad risk,
no one takes any risk, fewer and fewer loans are made, the
economy crawls more and more slowly. Balance sheets get
sorrier and sorrier, and regulators see more and more
evidence for more and more stringency.
   Yes, there surely has been fraud and excess to correct,
but if financial safety is the purpose there is also a need
for prudence and discrimination. Yet rather than reform the
underlying flaw of deposit insurance, we are sending
examiners who are supposed to second-guess the good loans and
the bad. Bankers are bad enough at this; who ever believed
bureaucrats would be better?
