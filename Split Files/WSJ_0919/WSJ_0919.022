   WASHINGTON -- Iran probably will provide Iraq with some
help in circumventing international economic sanctions, but
it has powerful reasons not to become a big embargo-buster,
analysts inside and outside the U.S. government believe.
   Iran may well decide to help Iraq procure some food and
other supplies in hopes of winning concessions during talks
designed to formally end the two countries' bitter eight-year
war. Moreover, Iran easily could conclude that its broader
interests are well-served by providing Iraq just enough
relief to keep the current Persian Gulf crisis bubbling along
unresolved until its Iraqi and American nemeses bloody each
other militarily.

   But Iran is likely to put distinct limits on any help. It
has little interest in giving so much aid that Iraq succeeds
in consolidating its hold on oil-rich Kuwait, thereby
becoming the clear power of the Persian Gulf and arbiter of
Gulf oil politics. And while Iran may not care about angering
the U.S. by embargo-busting, it probably doesn't want to
antagonize Europeans whose technical aid it wants.
   Some U.S. officials even suspect Iran is flirting with
embargo-busting as a way of extracting a payoff from Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf states opposed to Iraq.
   Iran's intentions have become important to U.S. policy,
because Tehran could provide Iraq significant economic relief
if it allows commerce to flow freely back and forth along the
countries' 750-mile border.
   American officials say they have little to go on but
indirect messages they have received from Iran through
diplomatic channels. These messages indicate that Iran
intends to abide by United Nations Security Council
resolutions banning trade with Iraq.
   Iran seems to have tactical reasons to allow some seepage
of goods to Iraq -- or to at least keep the West worrying
that it will do so. By simply hinting occasionally that it
may give Iraq some economic relief, Tehran can send the West
a clear reminder of its own strategically important location
and serve notice that the Gulf's future can't be decided
without taking Iran into account.
   Gary Sick, who was the chief Iranwatcher on President
Carter's National Security Council staff, says: "They will
use their embargo-busting as a bargaining chip with the
West."
   Iran's other tactical reasons for considering limited
embargo-busting arise from its complicated relations with
Iraq. In the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and subsequent
showdown with the international community, Saddam Hussein
last month appeared to accept Iran's terms for a formal peace
and he initiated negotiations on a treaty.
   In those negotiations, Iraq appears to have explicitly
offered to send Iran some of its refined oil products, which
Iran needs because of wartime damages to its refineries, in
return for shipments of food.
   Iran may want to play along for the time being. In
particular, Iran badly wants to win the return of thousands
of prisoners of war held by Iraq but who haven't been
registered with the Red Cross or returned home under initial
prisoner-of-war exchanges.
   In addition, Iran may want to stay on good terms with Iraq
long enough to get the Iraqi government to shut down offices
of Iranian opposition figures operating in Baghdad.
   But Iran's long-term interests suggest it won't want to
link itself closely with Iraq in an economic alliance opposed
by much of the outside world. While Iranian hard-liners
dislike U.S. policies in the Gulf, those same hard-liners
also have been the most virulently anti-Iraq elements in the
Iranian government.
   It also isn't clear that Iranian public opinion would
tolerate widespread aid to an Iraqi enemy that killed and
wounded tens of thousands of Iranians in recent years.
"Iranian public opinion would be scandalized by any show that
the Iranians are helping the Iraqis," says Shaul Bakhash, an
Iranian author and scholar now at George Mason University.
   Additionally, embargo-busting may not be a profitable
enterprise for the Iranians; Iraq, deeply in debt before the
Kuwaiti invasion and shut off from oil markets since, doesn't
have much material reward to offer Iran. "The profitability
of busting the embargo is questionable," says Robert Hormats,
vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
