   HOUSTON -- Amoco Exploration Co., a unit of Amoco Corp.,
and Mobil North Sea Ltd. said they will auction off their
interest in the Hutton Field in the North Sea. Mobil North
Sea is a unit of Mobil Corp., New York.
   The two energy concerns said they are selling their joint
15.3% interest in the field because they are adjusting their
portfolios. The field, which is operated by Conoco (U.K.)
Ltd., was discovered in July 1983. Production is expected to
continue to the year 2000. A sale is expected to be concluded
by November.
