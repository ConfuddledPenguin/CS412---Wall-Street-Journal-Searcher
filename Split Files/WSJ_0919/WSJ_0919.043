   SAN FRANCISCO -- Next Inc., searching for a way to break
into the computer industry mainstream, introduced three
powerful and aggressively priced computers.
   Next Chief Executive Stephen P. Jobs, best known as
co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., hopes Next's
second-generation products will ignite the five-year-old
company. Its original computer, released two years ago, was
roundly criticized and sold poorly, but the new models, which
are driven by one of the fastest computer chips on the
market, appear likely to win a warmer reception. The original
model was pulled quietly from the market in May, underscoring
the importance of the new machines for the company's
survival.

   "They are extremely attractive," said Ramy Goldstein, vice
president, equity financial strategies at First Boston Co.,
which is buying 100 of the new computers and expects to
purchase hundreds more in the coming year.
   Next said it has received orders for 15,000 of its
computers, which observers estimate is roughly double the
sales of its original model. The model with a black-and-white
monitor costs $4,995. The model with a color monitor costs
$7,995 and will be available early next year. The
black-and-white model, which Next said it will start shipping
in November, comes with a 68040 microprocessor, Motorola
Inc.'s latest and fastest microprocessor. A third model,
which won't be available until early 1991, starts at about
$12,000 and comes with a souped-up color monitor capable of
displaying live video or television.
   The aggressive pricing surprised observers, but Mr. Jobs
indicated that he doesn't want to see a replay of the
reception given his original Next computer, which came only
with a black-and-white monitor and sold to corporations for
nearly $10,000 and to universities for somewhat less.
   Mr. Jobs acknowledged that Next's first computer was "too
slow, too expensive, lacked {software} applications" and a
color monitor. In January, amid reports of the computer's
dismal reception, Mr. Jobs stepped up work on the new line.
"We decided we had to address all these {shortcomings} this
year," Mr. Jobs said.
   Mr. Jobs received significant help from Lotus Development
Corp., which yesterday unveiled a spreadsheet for Next's
computers. The program, called Improv, isn't modeled on
Lotus's 1-2-3 family of spreadsheets, but can exchange data
with 1-2-3 programs.
   Mr. Jobs contends that Next's unique operating software,
which combines a version of Unix with a series of screen
commands called Nextstep, shortens the time required to
create new software for Next computers.
   Many customers agree, but they note that there still isn't
as much software available on Next machines as on some
competitors' models. And there is a fear that owners of Next
computers will be stuck with Nextstep should Next's newest
products flounder and the company's survival come into
question.
   "Those are my two big worries, the proprietary nature of
Nextstep and Next's corporate viability," said Mr. Goldstein
of First Boston. He says he has contingency plans in the
event of Next's demise.
   Mr. Jobs argues that Nextstep isn't proprietary because
International Business Machines Co. has licensed it for use
with the company's line of workstations. But Mr. Goldstein
said IBM's version of Nextstep is still an unknown because it
hasn't been introduced.
   Even armed with stronger products, Mr. Jobs faces a
difficult time winning market share against the likes of Sun
Microsystems Inc., IBM and Apple, which is expected to
introduce a Macintosh powered by a 68040 chip early next
year.
   Observers say Next is likely to make inroads into narrow
markets for computers in the near-term and that it will take
another round of products, perhaps to come as early as next
year, before Next can challenge the industry's leaders. "I
think people with specialized needs are going to buy it,"
said Walter D. Feigenson, director, special projects at
Ashton-Tate Corp., which released a spreadsheet for Next's
computers earlier this month. "Let's not forget that the
Macintosh took a long time to establish itself, too."
