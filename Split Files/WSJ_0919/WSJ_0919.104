   OTTAWA -- Two Air Canada pilots were charged with
illegally smoking on separate Canadian domestic flights.
   The charges were the first to be filed under a year-old
law that prohibits smoking in federally regulated workplaces,
including government buildings, banks and airlines. The
charges were filed following complaints by an Air Canada
employee.

   If convicted, the pilots, Jack Haycock and Eppie Mulder,
could be fined up to 50 Canadian dollars (US$43). An Air
Canada spokesman said the airline will decide whether to
discipline the pilots after the court's ruling.
   The Canadian law bans smoking on all domestic flights,
most North American flights, and international flights under
six hours. The ban is to be extended to all overseas flights
in 1993.
   Air Canada, one of Canada's largest airlines, voluntarily
extended the ban to cover its longer overseas flights
starting Oct. 1. The airline estimated that 99.8% of its
flights will be smoke-free after the smoking ban is extended
next month. The ban won't apply to its
London-Bombay-Singapore route, where smoking remains popular.
