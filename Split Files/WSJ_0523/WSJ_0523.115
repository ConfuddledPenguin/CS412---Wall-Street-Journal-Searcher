   WASHINGTON -- Daniel Coleman's Dubliner restaurant here
already caters to patrons with disabilities, including James
Brady, former President Reagan's press secretary who was
wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt. Mr. Coleman says
he supports the Americans With Disabilities Act but worries
about how it will be enforced.
   "We serve blind customers and lawyers in wheelchairs; we
do everything we can to accommodate them," says Mr. Coleman,
who six years ago during a total renovation added features to
make his hotel and two restaurants accessible to the
disabled. "But this {new law} could cost businesses tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars. You have to be
reasonable about it; that's the whole thing."

   Many small-business owners are confused and fearful about
the legislation. The House bill, approved yesterday and
expected to become law, would require all businesses -- large
and small -- to be, in some form, accessible to people with
disabilities by the end of next year. Businesses with 25 or
more workers also would have to make accommodations for
workers with disabilities within two years, and those with at
least 15 workers, within four years. Discrimination against
the disabled in hiring or firing would be illegal.
   Many small-business owners aren't aware of what the bill
will require, says the National Federation of Independent
Business, the largest membership group for small firms. The
federation predicts the law could cause a "nightmare on Main
Street," though backers of the measure say such fears are
unfounded.
   "Contrary to what proponents would like us to believe, not
all the costs are small," especially in comparison with the
financial means of smaller companies, says John Motley, chief
lobbyist for the group. He says concrete ramps cost from
$1,000 to $10,000, widening an exterior door, another $3,000,
and hiring a certified sign-language interpreter, about $23
an hour.
   Richard Aronow, owner of Money's Worth Auto Rental in
Hartsdale, N.Y., says it would cost him about $5,000 a year
to maintain one car with hand controls for disabled patrons.
"But if I have the equipment, would I have greater liability
under my insurance policy? I don't know if there's anyone who
can tell you exactly what you have to do to comply."
   The National Association of Convenience Stores estimates
it could cost $50,000 for an average store to widen its
aisles to accommodate wheelchairs, lower display shelves and
make freezer cases usable by disabled patrons.
   Stewart Hartman Jr., president of Rutter Farm Stores, a
chain of Pennsylvania convenience stores, believes about a
quarter of his 51 stores would meet the bill's requirements.
Among other things, the height of shelves was lowered in
stores built in recent years, though the change had nothing
to do with the disabled; it was aimed at watching for
shoplifters, he says. But he worries that there aren't
specific requirements in the bill and says remodeling his
older buildings would mean losing substantial sales space.
   Albert Foer, chairman of Melart Jewelers, a 22-store chain
in the Mid-Atlantic states, says it's unclear whether jewelry
stores would have to alter display cases and lighting to
comply. "If all you have to do is have a doorway large enough
for a wheelchair to come through and you can assist the
customer without having to retrofit the interior, the cost
will be negligible," he says. But he estimates a major
interior renovation would cost $75,000.
   Many such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of what the
law will require, says Ellen Daly, a spokeswoman for the
President's Commission on the Employment of People With
Disabilities. If a business is doing a total renovation, it
would be expected to do as much as possible to provide
accessibility, Ms. Daly says. But if there was a recent
remodeling, "I can't imagine that the regulations would tell
a small convenience store you have to do all that over," she
says. "They'll have to be more conscious of who's coming into
their store and offer assistance, but they're probably doing
that now. And they may have to readjust the pull on the
door."
   In the case of the small car-rental agency, she notes that
hand controls don't interfere with the operation of a car's
foot pedals, so the auto could be used for regular rentals.
   But while the legislation requires only reasonable
adjustments, "it's difficult to know how the reasonable
standard provision will be enforced. It's very vague. That's
why everyone's so nervous," says Mark Gorman, head of
government relations for the National Restaurant Association.
"People could make a point of challenging you in court."
   Small business won a few changes in the bill passed by the
House. For example, Congress approved a provision giving
small firms extra time to comply after federal regulations
are issued. And, after an emotional debate about workers with
AIDS, the restaurant industry won an amendment that would
permit restaurants to transfer an employee with a contagious
disease to a job that doesn't involve food handling.
   Although disabled people must be considered for employment
if they can perform the essential elements of a job, an
amendment says courts should consider a business owner's
definition of the job when deciding what's necessary to
perform it. Small businesses also won a provision that says
structural changes required to provide access for the
disabled are the responsibility of landlords, not store
owners who lease space.
   The enforcement section of the bill, originally linked to
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, will also be tied to the proposed
1990 civil-rights bill. The new civil-rights bill would
permit a jury trial and punitive and compensatory damages
after a finding of intentional discrimination. The Bush
administration had pressed to require only the reinstatement
and back-pay remedies that exist under the current
civil-rights law for workers who prove discrimination.
   Small business also wanted an amendment saying that
disabled people must describe in advance their special needs
to a business owner and suggest how those needs could be met.
   A proposal for a $5,000 small-business tax credit was
rejected, but the idea is expected to be considered as part
of budget legislation.
