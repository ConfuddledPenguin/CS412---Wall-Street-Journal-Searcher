   Pinnacle West Capital Corp.'s board turned thumbs down on
both PacifiCorp's $1.82 billion takeover bid and Salt River
Project's $500 million proposal to buy some of the assets of
Pinnacle West's Arizona Public Service Co. unit.
   The PacifiCorp offer is "financially inadequate and not in
the best interest of Pinnacle West shareholders," said
Richard Snell, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Phoenix, Ariz., utility holding company.

   In a statement, PacifiCorp said it "hopes" Pinnacle's
board "will reconsider the rejection after hearing from
{Pinnacle} shareholders" at the annual meeting today.
"PacifiCorp is exploring its options which could include
approaching shareholders directly."
   Those options include a hostile tender offer for
Pinnacle's stock, said a spokesman for PacifiCorp, a
Portland, Ore., utility with operations in seven states.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Pinnacle
shares fell 25 cents, to $15.75 each, on turnover of more
than 1.4 million shares; PacifiCorp fell 25 cents, to $21.75
a share. Pinnacle's statement came late in the trading
session.
   Pinnacle said Salt River's $500 million proposal to buy
some of Arizona Public Service's transmission and
distribution facilities "is not acceptable financially or in
concept." In a brief interview, Mr. Snell said that "on the
surface, it makes absolutely no sense to us."
   But Salt River said its proposal is still on the table.
The quasi-municipality, which is Arizona's second-largest
electric utility, wants to rationalize its service territory
by acquiring Arizona Public Service assets in the central
sections of Phoenix and other nearby cities. Arizona Public
Service, the state's largest electric utility, serves the
downtown areas of those cities, while Salt River serves the
surrounding areas.
   Jack Pfister, Salt River general manager, said he wasn't
surprised by Pinnacle's rebuff in view of its rejection of
PacifiCorp's bid. "Our offer makes more sense in combination
with PacifiCorp's {offer} . . . because maybe their
objectives could be achieved without having all of {Arizona
Public Service's} service areas." Mr. Pfister said he hasn't
talked with PacifiCorp about whether their proposals could
work in tandem.
   Mr. Snell acknowledged that because the Salt River
proposal was submitted late Friday, Pinnacle's financial
advisers haven't studied it closely. By contrast, Pinnacle's
advisers had already dissected three previous PacifiCorp
offers dating back to November and had at least a couple of
days advance notice of the latest offer, which arrived
Thursday.
   Analysts thought the offer would be hard to resist because
it was all cash and it dropped conditions that made it easier
for Pinnacle to reject the earlier offers. After Pinnacle's
financial advisers reviewed the offer over the weekend,
however, the board's response was nearly the same as before;
this isn't a good time to sell the company. "We have a
direction for recovery and we will proceed in that direction
as an independent company," Mr. Snell said.
   The "real value" of PacifiCorp's bid is less than the
offered $21 a share because shareholders wouldn't receive
their money for more than two years, after all regulatory
approvals are received, Pinnacle said. During that time,
Pinnacle said its business strategies will have
"significantly increased both equity and the intrinsic value
of the company."
   Pinnacle said it can focus on paying down its $1.1 billion
debt now that it has put its MeraBank problems behind it and
found a buyer for its unprofitable uranium-mining operations.
In March, Pinnacle was released by regulators of all
financial obligations to its former MeraBank thrift unit
after making a $465 million infusion of capital into it.
   Pinnacle also is pinning its recovery hopes on the Palo
Verde Nuclear Generating Project, which Pinnacle operates and
in which it holds a 29.1% stake. Mr. Snell said, "I am
convinced, based in part on discussions with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, that we are very close to getting the
{full} plant up and running."
   But PacifiCorp says it thinks its merger proposal is a
better deal for Pinnacle shareholders and customers and its
next moves could come as soon as today's annual meeting. Verl
Topham, president of PacifiCorp's Utah Power &amp; Light Co.
unit, will be at the meeting as an "observer," the PacifiCorp
spokesman said.
   Mr. Topham is in Phoenix lobbying support for PacifiCorp's
bid from regulators, city and other local officials. Mr.
Topham, who held top posts at Utah Power before it was
acquired by PacifiCorp last year, presumably is telling
anyone who will listen that PacifiCorp has been a good
parent.
