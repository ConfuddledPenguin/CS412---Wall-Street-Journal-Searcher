   Polly Peck International PLC announced plans to raise its
stake in Sansui Electric Co. to 70% from 51%.
   The British company, whose biggest interests include
electronics and fruit, said it plans to make the Japanese
company a more international business by merging it with
Polly Peck electronics businesses in Italy, Taiwan and
elsewhere. Polly Peck's 51% investment in ailing Sansui last
January was a rare instance of a foreigner buying control of
a Japanese electronics company, and sparked controversy in
Japan.

   But London analysts said that the problems at Sansui, once
one of Japan's premier hi-fi makers, run deep. Rebuilding
Sansui "is going to take time and a lot of money," said
analyst Paul Beaufrere of London stockbrokers James Capel &amp;
Co.
   In London trading yesterday in a generally rising market,
Polly Peck's stock ended two pence lower at 431 pence ($7.27)
a share.
