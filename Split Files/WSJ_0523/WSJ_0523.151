   Strong buying interest propelled shares to close higher in
healthy London trading Tuesday, though several factors
dragged the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
off its intraday high.
   In Tokyo, stocks closed a quiet session higher, with
renewed interest in issues with environmental links and a
small-scale rally in high-priced, high-technology issues
adding to the gains on the key indicator. Hong Kong stocks
rallied 1.3% in active trading, on reports that President
George Bush will extend China's most favored nation trade
status for a year.

   In London, the 100-share index closed up 29.2 points at
2311.3, well below its 2332.7 midday peak but markedly above
its 2293.3 early low.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed with an
18.7-point gain at 1829.5. Volume was a hearty 629.7 million
shares, compared with the modest 316.2 million issues that
changed hands a day earlier.
   Markups pushed equity prices upward early in the session,
but failed to lure fresh buyers until the FT-SE 100 dipped
below 2300.0, triggering an influx of institutional
investors, a trader at a major British brokerage firm said.
Another dealer said bears were still at large in the market,
scrambling to cover their short positions.
   Dealers were split as to what caused the market to retreat
from its 50-point advance, with one suggesting a combination
of profit-taking and sentiment that the market was
overbought, while another reckoned the FT-SE 100 mimicked a
steady downward trend on Wall Street late in the London
session.
   Dealers said investors would be looking with caution to
British trade figures for April, scheduled for release
Wednesday. A Dow Jones survey shows Britain's trade deficit
is estimated to have narrowed in April to #1.5 billion ($2.53
billion) from a #2.18 billion gap a month earlier and from a
#1.39 billion shortfall in February.
   Individual corporate stories Tuesday were few, with
British Airways slipping 3 pence to 210 pence ($3.54),
despite a 20% increase in pretax profit for the year ended
March 31. The airline sounded a note of caution about
increased competition and the need to cut costs in fiscal
1991, and the market responded warily, a dealer said.
   Polly Peck, a conglomerate, slid 2 to 431, after
announcing it will increase its stake in Sansui Electric Co.
to 70% from 51% after merging two of its electronics units
into the Japanese concern. The company also said it arranged
for a listing of its Vestel Electronik Sanayaii ve Ticaret AS
on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and will sell 15% of the
company's shares to the public.
   Among companies that are to report earnings Wednesday are
Britain's largest brewer, Bass, which rose 25 to #10.49
($17.70); Courtaulds, a textile company, advanced 4 to 338
pence; B.A.T Industries, a tobacco and financial services
conglomerate, closed unchanged at 692; and Ranks Hovis
McDougall, a food company, gained 3 to 398.
   One of the biggest movers was the lubricants maker Burmah,
which jumped 23 to 617.
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues closed 173.25
points higher at 31938.30 on Tuesday. On Monday, the index
fell 248.67.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index
surged 241.56 points to 32179.86.
   Tuesday's first section volume was estimated at 500
million shares, up from 370 million shares a day earlier.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which fell 17.44 points Monday, gained 19.77,
or 0.83%, to 2390.59.
   Traders said the yen's gentle rebound Monday in Tokyo
added some encouragement to buy domestic demand-related
issues, particularly steel, shipbuilding and
plant-construction stocks. But most participants said the
yen's firming wasn't enough to break through any technical
barriers, and suggested the currency's movements were more of
an excuse to buy stocks that recently have been underplayed.
The firmer yen and a subsequently firmer bond market helped
plant contractors and stocks linked to spending on the
environment, traders said. But many large institutional
investors haven't done any significant buying.
   Trading was moderately active in high-technology shares,
such as precision machinery stocks, traders said.
   Buyers showed particular interest in stocks such as Chubu
Electric, up 70 yen at 3,700 yen ($24.10), Kokusai Electric,
up 170 at 5,090, Kansai Electric, up 90 at 3,920, and Tokyo
Electric Power, up 190 at 4,850.
   Financial issues, including the so-called Big Four
Japanese securities houses, were higher. Yamaichi Securities
rose 50 to 1,400, Nomura Securities added 90 to 2,390, Nikko
Securities gained 40 to 1,370 and Daiwa Securities added 60
to 1,640.
   Several steel shares ended much stronger, including Daido,
up 35 at 1,020, and NKK, up 13 at 641. Most pharmaceutical,
ship-building and nonferrous metal shares also rose.
   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index surged 40.04
points to close at 2970.87, while the broader Hong Kong Index
gained 25.17 to 1949.79. Turnover jumped to 1.19 billion Hong
Kong dollars (US$153.4 million) from Monday's lackluster
HK$731 million.
   Participants said the China trade news, attributed to Bush
administration officials, lifted one of the major worries
that had been restraining Hong Kong trading interest lately.
Commercial and industrial issues chalked up the sharpest
gains, followed by properties shares. Utilities advanced
moderately, while banking stocks were little changed.
   In Taipei, equities dropped further as buyers continued to
withdraw, with the key index falling to a new 15-month low.
The weighted index, which fell 5.72% Monday, shed another
272.57 points, or 3.9%, finishing at 6720.32. Trading volume
totaled about 900.7 million shares valued at 57.37 billion
New Taiwan dollars (US$2.11 billion), down from Monday's
962.5 million shares valued at NT$71.36 billion.
   Elsewhere in Asia, share prices closed higher in Sydney,
Singapore and Seoul, and lower in Manila and Wellington.
   In Europe, stock prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan, and were mixed in
Brussels. In Frankfurt, after tumbling 1.4% at the start of
trading, share prices rallied to close just above day-earlier
levels. South African gold stocks closed narrowly mixed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
