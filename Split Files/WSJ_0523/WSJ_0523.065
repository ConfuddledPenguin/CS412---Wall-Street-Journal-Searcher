   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. -- Stanley Works and one current and
one former executive of the tool maker were among a number of
defendants charged with conspiring to fix prices on
architectural hinges.
   A federal grand jury in St. Louis indicted Stanley Works;
Richard G. Martin, president and general manager of the
Stanley Hardware division; and John F. Hollfelder, who was
vice president of sales for the division when he left the
company in 1988.

   Also charged were Hager Hinge Co. of St. Louis; McKinney
Products Co. of Scranton, Pa.; David B. Gibson, president of
McKinney; Robert A. Haversat, a former president of McKinney;
Lawrence Brothers Inc. of Sterling, Ill., and its chairman,
John A. Lawrence.
   The indictment charges the defendants with engaging in the
price-fixing conspiracy from at least April 1986 to April
1988.
   For a corporation, the maximum penalty is as much as a $1
million fine; twice the gain the company derived from the
conspiracy; or twice the loss suffered by victims. For an
individual, the maximum penalty is three years in prison plus
as much as a $250,000 fine or the other two factors.
   Stanley Works said it and Mr. Martin would vigorously
defend themselves against the charges.
   Mr. Hollfelder was unavailable for comment.
   Mr. Lawrence declined immediate comment. The other
defendants couldn't be reached.
