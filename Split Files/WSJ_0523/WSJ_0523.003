   Today the House is scheduled to begin voting on
contentious Clean Air legislation that addresses -- without
much concern for costs and benefits -- acid rain from
electric power plants, air toxics from industrial sources,
and the urban smog problems ascribed mainly to automobiles.
Yet there is little point in heroic and expensive efforts to
build super-efficient and super-clean cars and mandate exotic
fuels, unless we also reduce urban congestion.
   A car that's stuck in rush-hour traffic gets zero miles
per gallon and the pollution per mile goes through the roof
no matter how well the car was designed or what the EPA test
stickers say.

   Market-based economic policies that charge for
externalities -- such as pollution and congestion -- with
pollution fees, road tolls and other user fees are usually
more effective than the command-control laws and regulations
now being fashioned by Congress. A fee system is certainly
less costly, and does not use up scarce resources of energy,
materials, and capital and labor.
   One of the goals of the Clean Air Act is to force a
super-clean car on every car buyer -- no matter where he
lives -- in the mistaken belief that this will solve the smog
problem in such places as Los Angeles. Yet adding super-clean
cars to the fleet can do little to improve air quality as
long as older, polluting cars remain on the road and as long
as there is no adequate monitoring of individual cars.
   The cost to the nation will be enormous; the White House
says it is willing to live with $20 billion a year. Don't
believe it] A little amendment, introduced at the last minute
by Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota -- and
co-sponsored by Minority Leader Bob Dole -- would force
refineries to produce a custom-designed gasoline with a large
percentage of -- you guessed it -- ethanol made from corn.
The current best estimate is that this gift to farmers and
distillers would add 20 cents to the price of each gallon of
gas -- more than twice the nine-cent federal gas tax -- and
thus increase the cost of the Clean Air Act to as much as $40
billion per year, or about $400 per household.
   Sadly, not one penny of this new gas tax would go to build
better highways or repair collapsing bridges. On the
contrary: The Highway Trust Fund would lose more than $1
billion a year because ethanol is exempted from the federal
gas tax -- on the quaint theory that if your car burns
ethanol it won't wear out the interstate highway system.
Ethanol, of course, is too expensive to compete with
gasoline, and therefore has to be subsidized in this sneaky,
roundabout way.
   But that's not all. While ethanol produces less carbon
monoxide, it will raise smog-forming emissions. If the
Daschle-Dole amendment survives the House (where it was
introduced by New Mexico Democrat Bill Richardson), it will
also raise the price of corn and of meat, for sure, and
deliver a double-whammy to America's poor.
   Of course, what really matters is what comes out at the
end of the tailpipe. There must be a better way than to
regulate the fuel -- and there is. It's called a pollution
fee, and it's set by the amount of emission from each
individual car. Thanks to new optical technology this can now
be done by remote sensing; as each car goes by the checking
device, a reading is taken, the license number is recorded,
and the fee is calculated and billed.
   With the scheme automated, the fee can be varied to
achieve the desired policy goal, including congestion
control. Each community or region is free to decide on the
best fee schedule. For example, the fee can be raised during
rush hours in urban areas that have smog problems and lowered
at night or even during days when meteorological conditions
would dissipate pollutants. By reducing the fee to zero in
rural areas we can effectively encourage a transfer of the
oldest, heavily polluting cars -- perhaps to Sen. Daschle's
home state -- and thus improve urban air quality without
wasting any resources.
   For a pollution fee, unlike a new motor fuel, doesn't
present a real cost to society. It is instead a transfer of
money that requires no expenditure of physical resources. It
goes without saying that pollution fees can then fund local
transportation infrastructure, now being paid for with other
tax dollars or with bonds.
   Another mistaken policy idea is that super-efficient cars
necessarily save energy. CAFE (corporate average fuel
efficiency) standards were originally introduced as a
conservation measure following the 1973 oil panic. The
current standard of 27.5 miles per gallon for the passenger
automobile fleet is well above the efficiencies of 20 years
ago. But the fat has been cut out, and further improvements
are likely to be very costly. Aerodynamics and lightweight
materials may be at their limits; further downsizing doesn't
jibe with what consumers demand, and will further decrease
safety, increasing injuries and deaths in collisions.
   Increasing CAFE is likely to be counterproductive also for
two reasons:
   -- Raising the capital cost of new cars will induce
drivers to hold on to their old, less efficient, more
polluting cars.
   -- Lowering the incremental cost of driving the additional
mile will induce more driving, less car-pooling, less use of
mass transit, and, of course, more congestion.
   To cut down vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) requires more
than just CAFE. It would take a stiff gasoline tax to
overcome the reduced cost of driving additional miles in a
higher-efficiency car. Fewer VMTs mean less oil use, less
pollution, and, of course, less congestion -- which in turn
reduces pollution and oil use even further.
   A motor-fuel fee is not as flexible as road tolls in
reducing congestion, but it is a lot easier to collect. It
can best be levied at the state and local levels and act as a
user fee to finance the construction and upkeep of state and
local roads now paid for by other state and local taxes.
Contrary to accepted wisdom, a gasoline tax has been shown
not to be regressive -- unlike the costs that are imposed on
low-income consumers by the Clean Air Act. But politicians
don't want to take the heat and much prefer to put the monkey
on Detroit's back -- even if such a policy is ineffective and
costly. Tens of billions of dollars per year will go down the
drain, or up in smoke -- take your choice of metaphor.
   Granted that the ideal way to control congestion (and
thereby reduce pollution and oil use) is through the use of
highway tolls. Here, too, technology is advancing. Automated
toll booths that recognize cars as they whiz by, and bill
them automatically, are already operating on an experimental
basis in several states. But there are less high-tech methods
that seem to work well in other congested places, such as
Singapore.
   To further control congestion -- hand in hand with road
tolls -- requires realistic fees for the use of curb space in
city streets. Parking charges that are commensurate with
commercial parking, and can be varied with time of day, would
avoid the traffic problem created when people circle the
block time after time looking for an empty 25-cent parking
spot.
   It's hard to overstate the importance of reducing traffic
congestion, which is estimated to cause economic losses to
the nation of $50 billion to $100 billion per year. But
instead of using essentially cost-free policies that don't
use up scarce resources -- like congestion tolls and
pollution fees -- we seem to be stuck with blunt and costly
instruments that are not likely to be effective in doing what
they are supposed to do -- like the new Clean Air Act and
CAFE.
   So to all those cheering for the Clean Air Act and higher
CAFE standards I can only say: Great] They'll raise the cost
of gasoline, cars, electricity and food. And some 200,000
people will be thrown out of work -- coal miners, auto
workers, and employees in small businesses that cannot cope
with the regulations. (Democratic Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois
even quotes a figure of 3.7 million "at risk.") But never
mind] We'll get federal money to retrain these people. The
country will surely need more lawyers and lots of
environmental consultants who can figure out what the Clean
Air regulations mean.
   For the sake of our politicians, let's just hope that
people won't notice when prices go up and living standards go
down. At least they won't know which party to blame. After
all, the Clean Air Act was crafted in a bipartisan
compromise.
