   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage companies were largely unchanged in the
week ended yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs were down
slightly, though they remained above 8% for longer-term
maturities, according to an 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service. The average yield on
one-year consumer CDs eased to 8.02% from 8.04%, while the
average five-year yield declined to 8.23% from 8.25%.

   Investors who bought small-denomination CDs through
leading brokerage firms did a bit better, as yields rose
slightly. Average yields on six-month broker-sold CDs went to
8.32% from 8.22%, while average yields on two-year CDs went
to 8.63% from 8.60%, according to figures compiled by
Banxquote.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
largely unchanged. Average yields on six-month jumbo CDs fell
to 7.91% from 7.93%, while one-year maturities rose to 8.11%
from 8.10%.
   The only bank in the survey that offered a CD with a yield
of at least 9% was Continental Bank in Chicago, which offered
a five-year jumbo CD at 9%.
   "It was a very uneventful week," said Banxquote Chairman
Norberto Mehl. "There wasn't any clear pattern in the
direction of interest rates, so CD yields stayed within a
narrow range."
