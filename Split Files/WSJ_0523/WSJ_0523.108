   Rhone-Poulenc S.A. said foreign exchange fluctuations
contributed to a 9.6% drop in first-quarter net profit after
payments to minority interests, to 1.37 billion francs ($245
million) from 1.52 billion francs a year earlier.
   The French pharmaceutical and chemical company said the
decline of the dollar and yen against European currencies was
particularly debilitating for its overseas income when
translated into francs.

   Consolidated revenue grew 7.4% to 19.93 billion francs,
but the state-controlled concern noted that first-quarter
revenue was down 2.9% when recent acquisitions were excluded
from the balance sheet.
