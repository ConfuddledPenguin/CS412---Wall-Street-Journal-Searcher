   ST. LOUIS -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it renegotiated
its principal revolving credit agreements totaling $1.4
billion with 28 U.S. and international banks led by New
York-based Chase Manhattan.
   New terms extend the agreements from 1993 to April 1995.
They also "give us additional flexibility to do other kinds
of medium- and long-term borrowing restricted by the previous
agreements," said a McDonnell Douglas spokesman.

   He added that the company has said it needs to borrow
about $1 billion before the end of this year, in addition to
$2.5 billion of debt that was outstanding as of March 31, to
"take care of inventory buildup of MD-11s in production and
flight testing."
