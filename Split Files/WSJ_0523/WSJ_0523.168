   WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady will ask
Congress today for massive new borrowing authority to finance
the savings-and-loan bailout, according to government
officials.
   The Treasury secretary is expected to acknowledge tacitly
that his department badly underestimated the cost of the S&amp;L
debacle last year, when it said the problem largely could be
solved with $50 billion in long-term borrowing. Officials
said that today he will give the Senate Banking Committee a
broad range of estimates for the long-term borrowing needs.
While they wouldn't reveal the precise range the secretary
will use, they said it is in the neighborhood of $80 billion
to $140 billion.

   The higher numbers, in part, reflect the fact that the
government may take over more thrifts than previously
estimated. In its original plan, the Treasury acknowledged
there might be additional costs, but not until after 1992.
The new borrowing authority Mr. Brady will seek may be needed
much sooner. If interest payments are included, the new
figures could put the total taxpayer cost of the bailout
during the next 10 years at $300 billion or more.
   At closed-door budget negotiations yesterday between the
White House and congressional officials, Mr. Brady emphasized
the substantial uncertainty surrounding thrift-bailout
estimates, and he is expected to do the same in his testimony
today. He is likely to point out that he has always said the
estimates will vary depending on economic conditions.
   During yesterday's session of the talks, White House
Budget Director Richard Darman said eliminating the budget
deficit could require spending cuts and tax increases of as
much as $500 billion over five years, according to Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.).
Congressional and administration negotiators say they hope to
reach a consensus on how much to try to cut the deficit this
year and over the following four years. But there wasn't any
agreement on whether Mr. Darman's figure would be a wise or
politically possible target.
   The Treasury's earlier failure to estimate the cost of the
S&amp;L problem has been the subject of considerable grumbling in
the White House lately. Administration officials have urged
Mr. Brady to make sure his estimate is large enough this time
to guarantee that the administration won't have to seek
additional funds before the 1992 presidential election.
   Officials say Mr. Bush has largely escaped political blame
for the S&amp;L disaster by claiming he inherited the problem.
But they fear he could be politically harmed if he has to go
back for more money shortly before the next election.
   In addition, administration officials want to devise a
permanent solution to the S&amp;L mess before completing budget
talks with Congress. Otherwise, the ever-burgeoning S&amp;L
fiasco could undermine any budget agreement in the future.
   The top of the Treasury's new range of estimates
represents the costs if the government has to close down
another 600 S&amp;Ls, in addition to the roughly 400 already
closed. Those figures suggest about one-third of the thrift
industry ultimately would be taken over by the government.
   Mr. Brady's testimony is expected to leave unresolved the
difficult question of how to finance the increased costs. The
administration and Congress previously agreed to raise the
first $50 billion through off-budget borrowing by a new
organization called the Resolution Funding Corp. But there
currently is talk in the administration of disbanding that
organization and raising the rest of the funds through
ordinary long-term Treasury bonds.
   How to finance the S&amp;L bailout is certain to be a critical
issue in the current budget talks. Officials believe a likely
solution will involve having the remainder of the S&amp;L
borrowing done by the Treasury and counted in the budget, but
declared exempt from the deficit targets set by the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   The budget negotiators also will have to deal with the
separate issue of "working capital" to finance the sale of
thrift assets. In addition to the $50 billion in long-term
borrowing, Congress has approved short-term borrowing of as
much as $45 billion to pay carrying costs for assets such as
real estate that will later be sold, presumably recouping
much of the $45 billion.
   The Treasury's new estimates are in line with those made
by other analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office
and the General Accounting Office. Auburn University
Economist James Barth, who has studied the savings-and-loan
situation, says he and a colleague recently estimated the
borrowing need at $100 billion to $134 billion.
   At yesterday's 2 1/2-hour session of budget negotiations,
several participants said, administration and congressional
negotiators inched closer to a common definition of the
deficit problem. "We're beginning to see some daylight," said
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.). "We're moving toward a common
set of ground rules."
   Mr. Darman outlined 11 different ways to measure the
deficit, and projected the gap six years into the future
under each definition. The summit negotiators reached no
agreement on how to measure the deficit.
   Mr. Darman labeled all figures on the thrift bailout
"guesstimates." He estimated that thrift-bailout costs of all
sorts -- not just the added borrowing authority Mr. Brady is
seeking -- will amount to about $39 billion this year, $61
billion in 1991 and $51 billion in 1992. The annual costs are
projected to fall sharply in subsequent years as the
government sells off assets acquired from failed thrifts and
pays off some of the debt incurred to finance the bailout.
