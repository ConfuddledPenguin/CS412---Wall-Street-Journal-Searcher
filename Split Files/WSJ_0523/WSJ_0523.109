   World petroleum prices were mostly lower on a continuing
lack of evidence that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is cutting back on high oil output.
   In European spot and futures markets, prices of North Sea
crudes declined between 10 cents and 20 cents a barrel. In
the U.S., the price of crude oil for July delivery fell 12
cents a barrel to settle at $18.92 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.The Merc's June crude contract plunged 58 cents a
barrel to $17.68. But volatility had been expected because
yesterday was the last day of trading for the June contract.

   Oil analysts attributed the general weakening of markets
to the glut of crude from the continued over-quota production
in OPEC.
   "There is concern about the crude overhang in the U.S.,
which has been a magnet for much of the crude," said Mari
Buglass, a London-based international oil analyst for
Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Prices cannot move up until the
surplus works off."
   As a result, traders yesterday anxiously awaited the
weekly report of U.S. oil inventories by the American
Petroleum Institute. According to a survey by the Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report, trading houses were
predicting a decline of some 900,000 barrels in U.S.
inventories.
   But the API report, released after futures trading had
closed, showed instead that crude inventories jumped 4.4
million barrels last week. The new total of 380.6 million
barrels is 40 million higher than the year-earlier level.
Minutes after release of the report, crude oil prices were
down 15 cents a barrel in the U.S. cash market.
   The API statistics added another layer of pessimism to
traders' general expectations on the near-term course of
prices. Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp., New York, is
among those who look for a "continuing slide." Probably, he
said, "we will see July crude testing the mid-$18 level over
the next couple of days."
   Meanwhile, those who monitor OPEC said there are few signs
that production has dropped much, if any, from the April
level. Although they said it's too early to draw any final
conclusions on May volumes, several agreed that the only
reductions of any size have been made by Saudi Arabia, the
OPEC kingpin, which was producing some 450,000 barrels a day
over quota.
   Saudi Arabia is now producing at its quota of 5.4 million
barrels a day, said Cristina Haus, a consultant to
Washingtonbased Energy Security Analysis, which monitors oil
supplies world-wide. But she suggested that May's total OPEC
production won't average much below 23.5 million barrels a
day, down only slightly from April's 23.7 million.
   In other commodity markets:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose as traders reacted more to
reports of strong demand for copper in London, rather than to
news that Kennecott Copper Corp. had come to agreement with
the United Steelworkers union on a new labor contract. The
soon-to-expire May contract rose 1.85 cents a pound to
$1.2175 while July jumped 2.70 cents to $1.1615 on the
Commodity Exchange in New York. The premium of May over July
narrowed yesterday, but in London the premium of the cash
price over the three-months delivery widened under strong
merchant demand for immediately available copper, according
to analysts. One analyst said that some of the strength in
London also may have been generated by traders who had sold
options contracts that expire in June and were buying them
back because of the sharp advance in prices. The June 30
expiration of union contracts with three U.S. producers and
the possibility of subsequent production disruptions has been
hanging over the copper market, analysts said. With the
Kennecott settlement, such prospects have been reduced, they
said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose sharply, as first
platinum and then silver led advances, with gold following
reluctantly. July delivery silver was particularly strong,
ending with a gain of 15 cents an ounce at $5.3350, which was
just one cent an ounce below its high of the day. July
platinum rose $3.80 an ounce to $504.90. June gold edged
higher by $2.30 an ounce to $376.40. Analysts attributed the
strong surge in silver to technical considerations, for the
most part. Lawrence H. Heim, editor of the Heim Investment
Letter in Portland, Oregon, observed that July silver
actually began its rally when it penetrated above $5.10 an
ounce on Friday. Peter Cardillo, trading adviser for
Josephthal &amp; Co., New York, noted that the July contract's
ability to close over $5.30 was a particularly constructive
feature and could help it advance further. The contract has
established a good technical base, and was influenced by a
rise in the bond market and the prospect of lower interest
rates, he said. Platinum was chiefly influenced by concern
over further violence in South Africa, such as took place
over the weekend, an analyst said. South Africa produces more
than 85% of the world's platinum.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Labor problems in the Ivory Coast continued to
boost futures prices. The July contract rose $45 a metric ton
to $1,491. During the session, the contract traded as high as
$1,502. The list of labor sectors demanding pay raises in the
Ivory Coast grew yesterday, according to Sandra Kaul, analyst
for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. Joining the labor
protests, which recently featured demonstrations by army
recruits and the police, were postal workers, electricians
and telecommunication employees, who threatened to walk off
their jobs on June 1 and 2 if their pay demands weren't met,
she said. In addition, dock workers still have a strike
scheduled for June 5, the police aren't completely back at
work after having their demands met last week, and customs
workers are expected to strike on Friday, Ms. Kaul said. The
Ivory Coast and Brazil are the only nations that harvest a
substantial summer crop, or mid-crop, of cocoa beans, and are
expected to supply most needs for the next several months,
Ms. Kaul said. Brazil also is suffering from some labor
unrest in response to the stringent economic policies that
were imposed by the new government, she said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: The soonest-to-expire July contract continued
firmer, surging to a new high on strong demand and tight
supplies of cotton. The July contract ended with a gain of
1.64 cents a pound at 79.77 cents. During the session it
traded at a new life-of-contract high of 79.94 cents, topping
the old high of 78.70 cents. More deferred contract months,
which represent the 1990-91 season that will begin Aug. 1,
showed small changes and were mostly lower. Buying of July
contracts has been generated by the strongest demand in
recent years, both domestic and from overseas, said Thomas
Mueller, analyst for Merrill Lynch, New York. Also, supplies
of cotton in relation to the current rate of use are low, he
said. As an example, Mr. Mueller noted that certified stocks
of cotton in warehouses of the New York Cotton Exchange
amount to only about 60,000 bales. The July open interest, or
the number of futures contracts that remain to be either
nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled by delivery of
the commodity, amounts to 1.6 million bales.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices closed mostly
lower following an Agriculture Department wheat report. The
report indicated that the winter wheat crop remains
essentially unharmed by the floods that swept large portions
of the southern Great Plains over the past week. Recent
indications of export interest in wheat haven't fueled a
rally in the futures market, analysts said, because most
countries are expected to wait a month or two before buying,
in expectation of lower prices. Further pressure was put on
winter wheat futures prices by rains across the northern
Great Plains, where scanty rainfall had been supporting
futures prices for wheat planted each spring in that area.
Wheat futures for July delivery dipped 2.25 cents a bushel to
close at $3.3475 on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn and
soybean futures prices also closed lower, reflecting
continuing concern over the Soviet Union's ability to finance
grain exports. July corn slid 2.25 cents a bushel to close at
$2.7475, and July soybeans declined 1.5 cents a bushel to
close at $6.09.
