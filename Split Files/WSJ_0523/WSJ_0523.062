   TOKYO -- Japanese shipbuilders signed export contracts to
build 25 ships with a combined weight of 1.1 million metric
tons in April, up 78% from 589,725 metric tons a year
earlier, the Japan Ship Exporters' Association reported
Tuesday.
   In March, by comparison, the shipbuilding industry
contracted to export 16 vessels, weighing 827,800 metric
gross tons.

   The association spokesman traced the sharp year-on-year
rise to comparatively sluggish contracts last year when an
increase in export insurance fees imposed at the beginning of
April 1989 caused a large number of ship buyers to rush their
orders ahead of the deadline. In March 1989, ship export
contracts rose to a high of 1.5 million tons.
