   Children and teen-agers purchase $1.25 billion in tobacco
products annually, according to a study published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Although 43 states prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors,
American children between the ages of eight and 18 consume
947 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers of
smokeless tobacco each year, according to the survey.

   The survey also estimates annual federal and state tax
revenues from tobacco sales to children at $325 million.
   The authors of the study -- Joe Tye, president of Stop
Teenage Addiction to Tobacco, and Joseph DiFranza, an
assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center -- blame the problem on lax enforcement of
minimum-age laws by local officials and indifference to the
problem on the part of tobacco marketers.
   "It really is an enormous business," said Dr. DiFranza,
"In medicine we treat tobacco as an addictive substance, yet
an 11-year-old can buy a pack of cigarettes."
   Some critics fear that's happening more frequently.
Although unit sales of cigarettes in the U.S. slumped 3% last
year, one independent study, the Gallup Youth Survey, shows
that the percentage of teenagers aged 13-15 who smoke jumped
to 11% last year from 7% in 1988. At the same time, sales of
moist snuff, which is popular among teen-age boys, increased
4.6%.
   Although most states have laws in place that restrict
tobacco sales to minors, few are enforced, according to the
JAMA study. Several small communities, however, have enacted
tough new laws, and early results indicate they can be
effective. In Woodridge, Ill., a Chicago suburb, an ordinance
enacted a year ago requires merchants selling tobacco to
purchase licenses from the town. Retailers who repeatedly
violate the ban may lose their license and be fined up to
$400.
   To test compliance, the Woodridge police department
regularly sends out 13-year-old "agents" to try to buy
tobacco from the village's 38 licensed vendors. Last March,
three stores lost their licenses for supplying cigarettes.
Since then, according to local police officials, no retailers
have gotten caught in the sting operations.
   Tobacco marketers deny targeting children. The $40 billion
industry steadfastly maintains its ads and promotions are
meant for adults only. "The tobacco industry is diametrically
opposed to kids using tobacco," said a spokeswoman for the
Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group.
   Manufacturers argue that their customers are wholesalers,
rather than consumers, and that they can't always control
retailers' actions. A spokesman for Philip Morris Cos. said
the company provides retailers with signs that proclaim age
limits, and gives out brochures to instruct store clerks
about tobacco laws.
