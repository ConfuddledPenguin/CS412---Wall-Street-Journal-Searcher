   The Soviet Union is drawing on hard currency reserves and
setting up a collection agency to help cover overdue bills
for Western goods, Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Stepan
Sitaryan said.
   Mr. Sitaryan, who is also the head of the State Foreign
Trade Committee, told the government daily Izvestia that slow
payments were starting to affect the country's credit rating.

   He blamed the delays on Soviet economic woes, a fall in
exports and the inexperience of many Soviet companies, which
since late last year have been allowed to trade directly with
foreign companies.
   He said the state plans to boost exports in May by one
billion rubles -- $1.6 billion at the official exchange rate
-- to offset the delays, and is setting up a company to
recover debts it is owed. "In some cases we are using part of
the country's hard currency reserves," he said, without
giving further details. He said he expected Western companies
to be understanding.
   In Ames, Iowa, a high-ranking Soviet official acknowledged
his country has fallen behind in payments for imports, but
called the lag a "temporary" problem.
   "We do pay our bills, and we don't rob Peter to pay Paul,"
Ivan Skiba, a member of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee, told a symposium at Iowa State University.
   Until this year, the Soviet Union had a reputation for
paying for its massive food imports immediately. But in
recent months it has fallen behind in paying for imports on
everything from New Zealand wool and butter to Japanese steel
pipe to more than $1 billion worth of grain purchased from
the U.S. and other countries. Western analysts blamed the
problem on confusion caused by the reshuffling of Soviet
officals as part of President Mikhail Gorbachev's revamping
of the economy as well as other internal economic problems.
   Soviet grain importing officials are coming under internal
criticism for spending huge sums of scarce hard currency on
massive grain imports. The Soviet Union has been acquiring
U.S. crops, mostly corn and wheat, at a pace nearing the
record set in the 12 months ended last Sept. 30 of more than
21 million metric tons.
   A Reuters survey of medium to large Western concerns with
representatives in Moscow showed that most had been owed
money for the past six months and that some had frozen
further shipments until past debts were paid.
   Mr. Sitaryan said Western banks were toughening conditions
on loans and were even demanding the return of some
short-term obligations, which in the past had been renewed.
   Businessmen say Soviet companies and state trading
associations, now free to deal directly with foreign firms,
are ordering more than they can afford. Though the state now
allows concerns to deal directly abroad, it no longer
automatically guarantees payment to foreign suppliers.
   Mr. Sitaryan said Soviet companies had to realize that the
state was no longer going to protect them in times of
difficulty and that they had to balance their books.
   "Nowhere in the world does the state take responsibility
for the obligations of firms," he said.
