   Move over humans, here come the computers.
   More investors are betting their chips on computer-driven
mutual funds, taking a bite of the "quantitative" investing
techniques that have long been popular with big institutions.

   "For anybody managing a portfolio of equities, ego and
emotion get in the way," said William Leugers, portfolio
manager of the Gradison Established Growth and Gradison
Opportunity Growth funds.
   Not so with computer-driven investing. "It's a more
dependable approach," said Jarrod Wilcox, chief investment
officer at Colonial Management, which four years ago switched
all of its stock funds to "quant" techniques.
   Quantitative investing runs the gamut from index funds,
which merely buy and hold the securities that make up an
index, to actively managed funds that use computers to pick
stocks.
   These techniques became popular with institutional
investors in the early 1970s, as evidence emerged that
traditional stockpicking wasn't producing market-beating
results. But until recently, the small investor was largely
left out.
   Not any more. In addition to a growing number of index
mutual funds, there are also more computer-run funds.
Advocates argue that these computer-driven funds get an edge
from more disciplined buying and selling and from better
portfolio diversification. The computer also provides a means
for rigorously double-checking and refining investment
methods.
   Score to date? Pretty good. Although computer-driven
mutual funds have had a tough time beating the market over
the past three years, they have generally done better than
the average growth-stock fund tracked by Lipper Analytical
Services, a New York mutual fund research firm.
   One reason for the recent good performance of quantitative
fund managers: They generally remain fully invested in stocks
at all times, believing that it is impossible to call turns
in the stock market. That gave them an edge over other fund
managers during the long bull market of the 1980s.
   In the most recent sign of quantitative investing's
growing availability, small investors can now invest with
Barr Rosenberg, who previously turned away clients with
anything less than $75 million. Mr. Rosenberg, a onetime
economics professor at the University of California,
Berkeley, was among the early proponents of modern portfolio
theory, which shuns individual stock research in favor of
constructing portfolios that produce the maximum return for a
given level of risk.
   Though Mr. Rosenberg turned his hand to money management
in 1985, until recently almost all his clients were big
institutions. But when Bell Atlantic Corp., one of Mr.
Rosenberg's clients, asked him to manage a mutual fund that
was primarily aimed at the firm's employees, Mr. Rosenberg
agreed. The fund, which was launched in February and has a
$1,000 minimum, is open to all investors.
   So how does a computer pick stocks? At Gradison &amp; Co., buy
and sell decisions are made after a monthly computer run. For
the $140 million Gradison Established Growth fund, for
instance, the computer identifies companies that meet minimum
criteria in terms of return on equity, return on assets and
ability to meet debt payments.
   Gradison's computer also excludes companies that haven't
made a profit in each of the last three years and don't have
rising earnings over the past 12 months. If earnings falter
at one of the companies the fund currently owns, the fund
buys a replacement stock that meets its criteria and is also
cheap in terms of price-to-book value.
   "It's simply a series of rules that helps you to buy
companies pretty close to asset value," explained Mr.
Leugers, the fund's portfolio manager. The fund's largest
positions include Ingersoll-Rand Co., Great Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Tea Co., Woolworth Corp., International Paper Co.,
United Technologies Corp. and Reynolds Metals Co.
   Unlike most quantitative managers, Mr. Leugers will boost
his funds' cash holdings if the computer tells him the market
is pricey, as measured by the price-to-book value of the
Standard &amp; Poor's 400-stock index. With the S&amp;P 400 currently
at 2.25 times book, Mr. Leugers has his funds 30% in cash,
the maximum allowed by the computer model.
   While the computer picks the stocks, Mr. Leugers spends
his time refining the computer's stock-picking criteria and
also checking that the computer doesn't stray because it gets
fed bad or misleading data.
   "If garbage goes in, garbage comes out," said John
Nagorniak, who runs Vanguard Quantitative Portfolios. "When
Texaco lost the big court case, that wasn't in any of the
numbers. That wasn't a factor that was quantitative in
nature. You don't want to buy something with a P/E of two
(price of two times earnings) unless you can be sure about
the E."
   Mr. Nagorniak, whose fund seeks to outperform the S&amp;P
500-stock index, has programmed his computer to use 30 value
criteria in picking among the 500 stocks that make up the S&amp;P
500 index. The fund currently owns 190 of them.
   "We don't want the fund to stray too far from the S&amp;P,"
said Mr. Nagorniak. "Anybody who is in the fund is going to
be exposed to general equity movements."
   To get around the problem of bad data, 20th Century
Investors doesn't use outside data bases. Instead, it employs
six researchers whose sole job is to punch in financial
information on 7,200 companies.
   Though its stock-picking is based on a computer system
that identifies companies with accelerating earnings and
revenue, 20th Century isn't purely quantitative. The firm's
five-person stock-picking team uses the computer's picks as a
starting point, but then selects from among those picks. Most
quants don't second-guess the computer.
   Though 20th Century's approach isn't as strictly
quantitative as some others, it has paid off big for
shareholders. The group's two oldest stock funds, 20th
Century Growth and 20th Century Select, rank just behind
Peter Lynch's Fidelity Magellan Fund in terms of 15-year
performance. But 20th Century has this one advantage over
Magellan: while Peter Lynch retires this month, 20th
Century's computer isn't going anywhere.

   Recently, most computer-driven funds haven't kept up with
the market, but have done slightly better than their human
counterparts.
