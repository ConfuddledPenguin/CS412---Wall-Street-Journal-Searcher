   San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. said the California Public
Utilities Commission approved an agreement the company
reached with several customer groups in January that will
lead to a 4% overall rate increase.
   The increase, the first by San Diego Gas in five years,
will give the company $50.8 million in additional annual
revenue. It reflects a rise in inflation, increased capital
spending and fuel costs and a projected rise in the cost of
buying power from other Southwestern utilities.

   Under the agreement, San Diego Gas said its residential
rates will go up 2%, boosting a typical customer's monthly
bill for gas and electricity to $61.14 from $59.79.
Commercial and industrial rates will rise 6%, agricultural
rates 8% and street lighting 4%.
   San Diego Gas stock rose 25 cents yesterday to close at
$43 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
