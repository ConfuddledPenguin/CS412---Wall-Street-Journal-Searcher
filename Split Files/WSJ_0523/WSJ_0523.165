   ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Martech USA Inc. said it expects
lower-than-anticipated fiscal 1990 revenue and profit because
of reduced work associated with the continuing cleanup of
last year's Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   Martech, an oil field-cleanup and marine-services firm,
said it expects to report revenue for the fiscal year ending
August 31 in the range of $52 million to $55 million, and net
income for the year approximating $1 a share, or about $9.4
million. The figure is higher than year-earlier results, but
less than the $65 million in annual revenue that Martech had
anticipated earlier this year and below earnings of $1.10 to
$1.17 a share anticipated by some analysts. The outlook
basically assumes roughly flat earnings and revenues for the
second half compared with year-earlier levels.

   Martech said the revised outlook assumed no further
revenue contribution from Exxon Corp. from work on the oil
spill, which accounted for more than 80% of the company's
second-half revenue last year. Martech said Exxon plans to
increasingly rely on bio-remediation techniques in completing
the cleanup, which is much less labor-intensive than the
process used last year.
   Martech emphasized that it is still bidding for certain
Exxon contracts on the spill and still may realize additional
revenue from it. A spokesman said the latest estimate was
"almost a worst-case scenario."
   Martech became publicly held in December. While the
company recently changed its fiscal year, for the 12 months
ended August 31, 1989, it had profit of $7.7 million, or 64
cents a share, on revenue of $41.1 million.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Martech
closed at $11.50, down 50 cents.
