   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Has the runaway success of the Mazda
Miata left room for a similar car, Ford Motor Co.'s new
Mercury Capri? The likely answer: Yes, but perhaps not as
much room as Ford would like.
   The Capri debuts July 19, about two years after Ford first
unveiled it and 16 months after the launch was first
scheduled. In the meantime, Mazda Motor Corp.'s Miata -- the
Capri's most direct competitor -- hit the market with a bang.
It stole some of the attention, and likely a big chunk of the
sales, that Ford wanted for the Capri.

   But Ford executives, who invited reporters to Phoenix to
test drive the Capri, say there's room for both cars. "The
Miata is a performance sports car, a plaything for
middle-aged men," says Ross Roberts, the vice president who
heads Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division. He says the Capri is
aimed at young buyers between ages 25 and 37, some 60% of
whom will be women.
   That may prove a difficult challenge for Lincoln-Mercury,
which emphasizes big luxury cars and attracts buyers with an
average age of about 57. The division tried to broaden its
lineup, and its customer base, in the late 1980s with the
sporty Merkur line imported from its European operations. But
Merkur sales lagged, and Ford killed the line last year.
   The Capri also is an import; it's built by Ford's
Australian operations. Ford hopes that young consumers will
see the Capri as more versatile than a Miata, and thus will
be willing to buy it as their only car. The Capri, unlike
Miata, has a back seat, albeit a tiny one. And the Capri's
trunk is a bit bigger.
   Also important for younger buyers, Capri will be priced
below Miata. The Capri's base price is $12,588, with the
turbo-charged XR2 version starting at $15,522. The Miata's
base price is $13,800, although the car has proved so popular
that many Mazda dealers have charged buyers several thousand
dollars more than the sticker price. It's a situation that
Lincoln-Mercury officials say they hope to avoid.
   The Miata and the Capri have a lot in common. Unlike other
modestly priced competitors such as the Honda CRX and the
Toyota MR2, both Miata and Capri are convertibles. And while
the Capri's somewhat angular lines contrast with the curvy
shape of the Miata, both sport nostalgic styling designed to
evoke the British roadsters of the 1960s.
   "I'd be surprised if the Miata could soak up all the
demand that exists for this type of vehicle," says David
Whiteside of J.D. Power &amp; Associates. But analysts add that
being second instead of first may make Ford's plan to sell
30,000 Capris a year in the U.S. (in addition to Mazda's
40,000 Miatas) too optimistic.
