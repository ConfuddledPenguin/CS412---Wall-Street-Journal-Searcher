   Microsoft Corp. introduced a new version of its Windows
software, which makes personal computers easier to use by
giving the MS-DOS standard a major facelift.
   The product, which sells for a list price of $150, is
expected to cement the company's position as the dominant
supplier of the software for personal computers.
