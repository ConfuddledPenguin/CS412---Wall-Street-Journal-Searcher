   Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam -- A saddle with legs. That's
what it looks like as the jockey steps up to the scales.
Weighing in after the race, the little fellow is barely
visible behind his gear. This and other curious scenes make a
day at the races here more like the Marx Brothers film than
Ascot.
   When it was known as Saigon, Vietnam's largest city must
have offered an elegant diversion at its Phu Tho racetrack.
That came to a halt after the communist takeover. Now, 15
years later, hooves once again are kicking up the turf.

   Racing was resumed in April 1989 with meets every Sunday.
It is unlikely, however, that French bettors would recognize
the track they built back in colonial days. The whitewashed
bamboo rails could be familiar and turf in the tropics
probably never was expected to be green, but the concrete
grandstand, doubtless once grand in its quasi-Chinese
imperial architecture, is a shambles, a shabby survivor of
war and communist neglect.
   For the past few years it has been used as a training
school by the government's sports department, as is obvious
from the basketball court in front of the VIP stand and the
soccer field in the infield.
   Most visitors to Ho Chi Minh City today quickly come to
accept the city's rundown look. So it is not the drabness
that startles the punter at Phu Tho; it's the races
themselves. The horses stand just 3.9 to 4.9 feet tall. To
match their diminutive mounts the jockeys are between nine
and 14 years old.
   Absurd though the scene may appear to American, European
and even Hong Kong and Thai race-goers, the re-opening of Phu
Tho is an event for communist Vietnam. It is a sporting
manifestation of the country's tentative moves toward
liberalization. The races may lack finesse, but their very
existence is a surprise win in the long-odds prosperity
stakes.
   The man heralding a new era of horse racing is 47-year-old
Vietnamese-Chinese businessman Philip Chow. Showing
remarkable entrepreneurial spirit, he approached the
Vietnamese authorities offering to restart horse racing with
an investment of $70,000 in cash and another $30,000 in
equipment. The government would receive a guaranteed income
from taxes, he said, while the people would benefit from the
entertainment value.
   "The sports department was a bit hesitant at first," Mr.
Chow said, "but they are happy now that they are seeing a
good revenue." That comes in the form of a 3% government tax
and an additional 8% to the sports department from each
meeting's average $50,000 take. In Hong Kong, the average
turnover is about $76.9 million per day.
   Mr. Chow, who owns a string of 13 horses, said about 300
horses, divided among some 500 owners, are kept for racing.
He admitted the animals are third and fourth class compared
to those of Hong Kong, and cost on average $300 to $500. All
are trained by their owners.
   The youthful jockeys, of whom there are nearly 50
professionals, are mostly farm boys who first learn to ride
on water buffalo. They receive 10% of the $13 to $18 prize
money for first place. In Hong Kong, first place in a class I
race earns a jockey nearly $5,000.
   For the punter, the sport is simple. There are no odds,
and betting is limited to forecasting both first and second
place -- an exacta. There are 30 betting windows, each with
50 tickets to sell. The minimum bet is 1,000 dong, about 25
cents. In addition, high-rollers can wager upward of $25 by
special receipts. Winners share 65% of the total take.
   So what do you fancy? Ten horses are paraded in the ring
before the race, all are minute but well-groomed. One or two
jerk the reins, but most are as docile as a five-year-old's
pony at the local gymkhana. A few of the spectators match the
animals with their race-card numbers; most just look on
curiously.
   Out come the jockeys, their silks -- pink with white bar,
blue with red star, purple and white chevron -- lending a
splash of color to the drab surroundings. Then it's a slow
canter down to the blue starting gate, where handlers in
yellow T-shirts make short work of packing in the animals.
   They're off] The video van accelerates and kicks up a
cloud of dust before settling to the more leisurely pace of
the race. The eventual winner soon breaks free of the pack
and in only one race is there anything like a tussle for
second place.
   Little excitement at the finish doesn't explain the
crowd's almost total lack of response. There is no frantic
cheering from the several thousand spectators, who seem a
pretty dour lot. Even the winning jockey is glum. As the
pretty girl in a dainty canary yellow "ao dai" presents the
trophy -- a shirt -- the winner looks like a bashful
schoolboy. The only people obviously having fun are the
infants frolicking in a long-jump sand pit near the stands.
   Should you have forgotten your Ascot hat, don't worry; Ho
Chi Minh punters favor shirt-tails and baseball caps. The
slogan on the headgear of one jaunty fellow reads, "American
Life We Like It." Clearly, even money for Groucho and long
odds for Karl.
