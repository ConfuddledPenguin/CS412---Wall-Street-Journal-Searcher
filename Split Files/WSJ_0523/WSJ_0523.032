   Chrysler Corp. says it has stopped seeking a buyer for its
defense-related operations and will restructure and increase
funding for research and development at the unit.
   The move comes nearly six months after the Highland Park,
Mich., auto maker announced plans to sell Chrysler
Technologies Corp. At the time of that announcement, and
again earlier this month, Chrysler officials said they
wouldn't sell any of the subsidiary's businesses if they
didn't get satisfactory offers.

   In March, Chrysler sold aircraft maker Gulfstream
Aerospace, by far the largest of Chrysler Technologies'
operations, for $825 million. Chrysler has been unsuccessful,
however, in unloading the remaining three defense-related
companies: Electrospace Systems, a defense and electronics
parts company; Pentastar Electronics, a spin-off subisidary
of Electrospace; and Airborne Systems, a manufacturer of
systems for military and commercial airplanes.
   Initially, Chrysler said it wanted to divest Technologies
to focus on its core auto operations. But despite a
significant drop in the auto maker's first-quarter net
income, there is "no dire need to sell the {subsidiary} at a
value less than what {it's} worth," said John Stellman,
Chrysler Technologies vice president and chief financial
officer. "Chrysler has a strong cash position."
   Partly because it wasn't a surprise, Chrysler's
announcement had little impact on the auto maker's stock,
which closed yesterday at $15.875, down 25 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. "There is no pain in
continuing to hold" the three businesses, said David Healy,
auto analyst at the investment banking arm of Barclays Bank.
"Clearly {Chrysler doesn't} need the money and the units are
profitable."
   Since putting Technologies up for sale last December,
Chrysler has recorded its financial results as discontinued
operations. Mr. Stellman said the subsidiary now will have to
be "reconsolidated" into Chrysler's financial report, but the
effect of this wasn't immediately available.
   Chrysler originally paid a total of $1.04 billion for the
businesses that it eventually combined into Chrysler
Technologies. When the auto maker announced they were for
sale, some analysts doubted the auto maker would recover its
expenditures. The defense industry was in a downward spiral
and widespread funding cuts for defense-related contracts had
brought more sellers than buyers to a depressed market.
   Keeping the three units will allow Technologies to move
ahead with plans put on hold last December, said Paul E.
Wright, Chrysler Technologies chairman. "The matter at hand
is to posture the companies for the 90s and to continue their
momentum and earnings growth," he said in a statement.
   This will mean increasing funding for research and
development. Expansion at Airborne Systems in Waco, Texas,
also will continue; capacity there was doubled last year.
Chrysler officials didn't disclose how much investment these
moves will require.
   Chrysler Technologies' defense-related contract awards
rose 12% in 1989 from a year earlier and "we hope 1990 will
be better," Mr. Stellman said. "We see healthy growth in new
business opportunities."
   Ford Motor Co. also is trying to sell its aerospace
operations, but doesn't expect it will have the same
difficulties as Chrysler. "I don't anticipate this kind of a
problem," Philip E. Benton Jr., president and chief operating
officer, said at a news conference in Phoenix, Ariz.,
yesterday. "In this kind of a market we could run into the
same problem, but right now there are enough prospective
buyers out there to give us an optimistic outlook." Mr.
Benton said Ford is "in the midst of talks" on the subject,
but didn't provide any details.
