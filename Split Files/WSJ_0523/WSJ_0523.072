   LONDON -- Embattled London United Investments PLC
transferred management control to two court-approved
administrators after the big insurance holding company failed
in a seven-week effort to find new funds to meet potential
U.S. liability-policy claims.
   In a step akin to filing for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, London United
entered a safe harbor for as long as three months while it
tries to form a plan to pay debt. People familiar with the
company have said it may need as much as #100 million ($168.7
million) or more to increase reserves for expected claims of
#750 million on U.S. policies such as officers' and
directors' liability, asbestos and medical-malpractice
insurance.

   Though an eleventh-hour savior for the major player in
London's substantial market for U.S. liability coverage can't
be ruled out, the administrators indicated they will focus
more on trying to assemble a rescue for some of the company's
insurance units to satisfy creditors, rather than try to keep
the holding company operating as a going concern. The
administrators, Colin Bird and Alan Barrett, partners at the
accounting firm Price Waterhouse, weren't available to
comment. London United officials declined to comment.
   David Rowland, chairman of the British insurance brokers
Sedgwick Group PLC, said it and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. of New
York, among others, have studied possible contributions to a
rescue effort.
