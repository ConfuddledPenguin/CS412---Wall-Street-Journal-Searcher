   WASHINGTON -- The government's new tactic of selling
partial thrifts instead of whole ones has forced a sharp
increase in the short-term cost of the thrift bailout. And
the approach is threatening to swell the budget deficit and
hasten the demise of the thrift industry.
   The huge amount of up-front cash the new strategy requires
already has pushed President Bush to stop talking about his
no-new-tax promise. "The interesting question is whether the
S&amp;L bailout was the catalyst to induce the president to allow
for a budget summit that would include discussion of taxes,"
says Charles Lieberman, who follows the bond markets for
Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. "I suspect that it
is."

   Underscoring just how seriously the White House is taking
the situation, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is expected
today to concede to the Senate Banking Committee that the
bailout is going to be far more expensive than the
administration previously said.
   "Clean Sweep," as regulators call it, was launched this
spring after it became clear that the thrift bailout was
bogged down. Instead of trying to sell "whole" thrifts --
that is deposits, loans, and charter -- the government is
trying to revive the thrift cleanup by selling whatever parts
people will buy. And all they really want to buy is deposits.
   Less than two months old, the new tack looks promising.
Bailout overseers expect during May to sell or liquidate
about 55 thrifts, more than they moved during the first seven
months of the bailout, which began last August.
   But the new approach has two serious side effects: It
unexpectedly and hugely increases federal spending, and so
complicates the current talks to cut the budget deficit. And
its belated recognition that no one wants to buy whole
thrifts moves the industry another step closer to extinction.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government's junkyard for
dying and dead thrifts, aims to move 141 S&amp;Ls out the door
during April, May and June. It may well pull that off. Yet
that success will carry a high price, costing the U.S.
government an astonishing $45 billion in up-front costs -- an
amount equal to one-third of the current budget deficit --
just for those 141 institutions.
   By requiring the government to put up enormous amounts of
cash to balance the deposits it sells, "Clean Sweep" has
thrown a monkey wrench into the budget negotiations. Its
spending kills any hope of meeting the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction targets, both for the current fiscal year
and the next. By making it impossible to reach the
Gramm-Rudman limits, the new approach threatens to alter the
framework of the budget talks. That has paralyzed the
situation, because no one wants to take the blame for poking
a new hole in Gramm-Rudman.
   The extra spending is controversial because it isn't clear
how much of it eventually will be recovered. The true cost of
the bailout will be known only when the government manages to
sell all the assets, such as real estate and soured loans,
that are left behind when deposits are sold. For now, it is
clear only that the bailout is taking unexpected extra
billions of dollars.
   Thrift spending may also keep interest rates up, as the
Treasury issues more debt than previously anticipated to
provide the needed cash. Moreover, William Seidman, chairman
of the RTC, says his agency will be out of money by the end
of the year, forcing the administration to come up with
billions more for the several hundred thrifts still in cold
storage.
   The "Clean Sweep" strategy results from the meager
response that regulators received in their attempts to move
thrifts out the door since last August. The RTC's Mr. Seidman
argues that he had no choice but to start selling the
choicest parts of thrifts -- mostly to banks -- while holding
on to their bad assets. "It's what the market dictates," he
says.
   In the long run, the "Clean Sweep" strategy may prove the
wisest way to wind up the S&amp;L disaster. "I think it's great
that, for the first time in 10 years, the government is
putting enough money on the table to do something about this
problem," says Bert Ely, a Washington S&amp;L consultant who in
the past has been critical of the bailout. "Once they get
this done, they can concentrate on selling the assets."
   The major drawback to these deals is indicated by the fits
the strategy is giving budget negotiators: They leave the bad
assets in the hands of the government, which doesn't know how
much it will eventually recover on their sale. "The
underlying cost {of the thrift cleanup} will be known only
when all the assets we acquire are sold," notes Ed Dale,
counselor to Budget Director Richard Darman.
   Yet it is only by breaking up the thrifts that the
government appears able to resolve the situation. The buyers
of the deposits are mostly banks that want them as parts of
branches, says the RTC's Mr. Seidman. "Fundamentally, they
don't want a savings-and-loan charter," he says.
   The thrift industry's biggest trade group, the U.S. League
of Savings Institutions, now is contemplating pushing for a
changed charter. But many others just want the thrift mess to
go away. "I hope that all the savings and loans disappear and
become banks," says Robert Smith, who used to sit on the
board of a now-failed California thrift sold under "Clean
Sweep." "Their day has passed."
