   "Think Sphinx," shout giant signs on New York buses. And
people in Egyptian garb hand out leaflets at Long Island and
New Jersey shopping malls.
   It's part of the hype for Giuseppe Raffa's production of
Verdi's "Aida," to be staged at Giants' Stadium in New Jersey
on June 1 and 2. Mr. Raffa says he wants to liberate opera
from "museums" and deliver it to "the people."

   The wrong people, perhaps, say some huffy New York
aficionados.
   "I can't think of any singer I'd go to Giants' Stadium to
hear," says Jerry Patterson, a rare-book expert. "And I'm not
sure I want any of those people to start coming to the Met
{Metropolitan Opera}: What if they sit next to me and start
eating potato chips during `La Boheme?'"
   "The whole thing sounds sleazy," says Walter Price, a New
Yorker who writes about opera. "This is an opera about
intimate human emotions, not elephants."
   And the New York City Opera's latest brochure on 1990
season offerings, of which "Aida" isn't one, trumpets
emphatically on its front cover: "No Elephants."
   But Mr. Raffa says yes, elephants. His Giants' Stadium
cast of 1,200 people and 35 animals will also include camels,
tigers, lions, leopards, horses, doves and a python. Plus
dancers, flame throwers, fireeaters, jugglers and a
46-foot-tall Sphinx that splits in two and belches fire.
   An Italian-born, free-lance conductor based in Montreal,
Mr. Raffa has been trotting his eight-ton Sphinx around the
world since 1987, attracting illustrious, if slightly faded,
singers for the opera's leading roles. He says 750,000 people
have seen his stadium "Aida" in Toronto, Tokyo, Sidney and
other cities, and at least 80% of them had never seen an
opera before. While Mr. Raffa says the New York ticket sales
are strong, he just canceled two Los Angeles performances of
"Aida" because of disappointing sales. But he still plans to
stage the opera in San Francisco's Candlestick Park on July
14.
   The Giants' Stadium opera novices needn't panic about
studying the libretto beforehand: Two giant screens will
flash all the words, translated from the Italian. But it may
still be hard to persuade neophytes to buy stadium tickets
for between $35 and $75 (Met tickets can actually be had for
less -- $15 for the cheap seats).
   In any case, Mr. Raffa, who runs his International Opera
Festival for profit, plans to mount an international "Carmen"
next year -- with an electronic bull.
