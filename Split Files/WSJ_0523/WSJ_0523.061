   HELSINKI -- Finland's Prime Minister Harri Holkeri said
the Soviet Union will repay its 300 million markka ($76.6
million) debt to Finland within a few days, press reports
said.
   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Stepan Sitaryan told Mr.
Holkeri that the debt would be handled "in the first
instance," the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper reported.

economic commission, which met in Leningrad to discuss joint
trade questions.
