   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted foreign trade
account showed a deficit of 4.31 billion francs ($769.5
million) in April after a revised March deficit of 1.06
billion francs, according to preliminary data published by
the National Customs Office.
   Prior to the revision, the adjusted March result had been
reported as a deficit of 858 million francs.

<TEXT>
   The deficit was significantly more than Paris economists
had been expecting as a result of inventory trends after a
significant drawing down of stock levels in the first
quarter.
   On an unadjusted basis, the April result was a deficit of
3.03 billion francs after a revised March deficit of 1.08
billion francs. The March result had been reported earlier as
a deficit of 877 million francs. France had an unadjusted
trade deficit of 2.35 billion francs for April 1989.
