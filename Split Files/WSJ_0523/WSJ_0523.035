   TOKYO -- The U.S. sharply criticized the pace of financial
reform in Japan, warning that unless Tokyo speeds up
liberalization it could face sanctions.
   Completing two days of bilateral talks on financial
issues, U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford
effectively issued an ultimatum to Japan's Finance Ministry
to agree soon to lift controls on all bank deposit rates
within a year or face a harsh review in a market-access study
that the Treasury Department must submit to Congress by
year's end.

   That study, required under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act,
could give impetus to legislative measures enabling
retaliation against Japanese financial institutions operating
in the U.S. One bill, the proposed Fair Trade in Financial
Services Act, could emerge from the Senate Banking Committee
as early as this week, Mr. Mulford said.
   "Rapid action to complete the deregulation process in
Japan would avoid what otherwise will become an area of
serious political conflict," Mr. Mulford said.
   Senior Japanese officials sought to dodge the implications
of his message by saying that they have agreed in principle
to liberalize deposit rates at "an early stage." Vice Finance
Minister Makoto Utsumi said both sides agree that
deposit-rate controls should be abolished, but differences
remain over the timing.
   At a joint news conference, U.S. and Japanese officials
said cooperation between the two countries remains good, and
they noted several key points of agreement in their talks.
Most notably, Japan agreed to allow individuals and
corporations greater freedom to set up offshore deposit
accounts.
   On matters involving foreign access to Japan's market, the
Finance Ministry said it will grant specialized banking
licenses to foreign securities companies here to allow them
to handle foreign-exchange transactions. Japan also pledged
to approve by June the use by Japanese investors, including
banks, of Globex, a new automated futures and options trading
system that will be used on Chicago's main exchanges. Both
matters had been held up by Japanese regulators trying to
avoid breaching a post-war barrier between the banking and
securities industries.
   But the gaps between the two sides clearly dominated this
week's meeting in Tokyo, the eighth in a series begun in 1984
as the so-called Yen-Dollar Talks. "It is hard to understand
how the country that ranks as the second-largest economy and
financial market in the world can be so out of step with the
rest of the leading industrialized nations," Mr. Mulford
said. He noted that the Finance Ministry still hasn't
eliminated a tax on Treasury bills, or made them available to
individuals. And he said foreign investment trusts still have
a tough time cracking Japan's market.
