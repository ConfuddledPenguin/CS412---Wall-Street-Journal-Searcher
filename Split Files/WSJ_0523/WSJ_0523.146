   DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. should try to recover $2.2
million paid to two former thrift executives in 1988,
apparently to settle disputes between the executives and
Southmark and its top officials, a court-appointed examiner
has concluded.
   In documents unsealed yesterday, examiner Neal Batson
concluded that Southmark made the payment in August and
September 1988 to entities controlled by former Sunbelt
Savings Association Chairman Edwin T. McBirney III and former
Independent American Savings Association Chairman Thomas M.
Gaubert, ostensibly to settle an unfiled suit over a soured
real-estate investment

   But Mr. Batson also noted that terms of the settlement
were kept confidential, even from Southmark's board, and
questioned whether the payment also was meant to settle
"substantial other unspoken matters" between Messrs. McBirney
and Gaubert and Southmark's top executives, Gene E. Phillips
and William S. Friedman.
   Mr. McBirney said he wasn't familiar with the examiner's
inquiry and couldn't comment. Neither Mr. Greenberg nor Mr.
Gaubert could be reached for comment.
   Separately, Mr. Batson concluded that Southmark should
challenge I.C.H. Corp.'s claim as a senior creditor holding
$50 million in 17.4% senior notes. Under previous management,
Southmark gave I.C.H. the notes in March 1988 in exchange for
$50 million in Southmark preferred stock, at a time when
Southmark was insolvent, Mr. Batson said. He concluded that
the transaction was unfair to other Southmark creditors.
