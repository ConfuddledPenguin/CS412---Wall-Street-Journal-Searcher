   Computer Keyboards:
   Which Type Is Right?

   INVENTORS of computer keyboards are departing from the
typewriter design, but acceptance is slow.
   Tony Hodges of Palo Alto, Calif., says several newspapers
as well as some of the regional Bell phone companies, at
their unions' urging, have expressed interest in his
keyboard, which splits in the middle and resembles an open
book face down. The adjustable "Tony" allows users to type
with palms facing each other, a position Mr. Hodges says
causes less strain than flat keyboards.
   Lawrence Langley of Christiansburg, Va., says his Vatell
Corp. has small contracts with the Navy and NASA to try his
"Ternary Chording Keyboard," which has only eight keys. Each
finger operates one key, and each key has three positions:
forward, back and neutral. By combining movements of left and
right fingers, the user can generate 64 characters. The keys
are angled to avoid wrist strain.
   Experts have their doubts. "The connection between injury
and the design of the keyboard is not well established," says
William Muto, human factors director at Texas Instruments.
Others warn of the expense of retraining typists.
   Concerned about retraining, Stuart and Barbara Herzog of
Tucson, Ariz., have put on hold a design that rearranges the
lefthand keys. Instead, they are trying a more modest
solution: plastic caps to fit over the D, K, 3, 5, and 8
keys. Each cap has a circle of bumps designed to make it
easier to keep fingers in the right position with less
strain.
   Meanwhile, Easy Office Products of Marblehead, Mass.,
offers a foam wedge that tips a keyboard toward the user to
relieve hand, neck and eye discomfort.
                                                                                                       

   Awarding Black Marks
   To Un-`Green' Packages
                                                                                                       

   MORE PACKAGES are blasted as wasteful, costly and bad for
the environment. Some manufacturers cry "uncle," others cry
foul.
   Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s Fab 1 Shot contains 16 single-use
packets of detergent placed in a segmented plastic tray,
covered with plastic and encased in a cardboard box. Rep.
Frank Pallone Jr. (D., N.J.) and three environmental groups
recently said this package creates "unnecessary plastic
waste."
   "We totally agree," a Colgate spokesman says, adding that
the company plans to bring out a new package that's 100%
recyclable cardboard and 60% smaller.
   Bang &amp; Olufsen AS encases a three-quarter-inch
record-player stylus in a 5 1/2-inch plastic cylinder wedged
by two pieces of plastic foam inside a foot-long cardboard
box. Rep. Pallone called this an "almost comical example of
excessive, wasteful packaging." Leif Lundin, president of the
Danish company's U.S. unit, says he probably will turn to a
"much smaller" package.
   General Mills Inc., on the other hand, is making no
apologies for Betty Crocker's MicroRave cake mix. Recyclers
with Connecticut's Capitol Region Council of Governments
complain that the package contains a plastic throwaway pan. A
company spokesman says the pan is reuseable, and General
Mills has removed the "not intended for reuse" label.
   The Washington Citizens for Recycling Foundation recently
awarded a "packaging booby prize" to the plastic egg that
encloses L'eggs panty hose. But Mary Gilbert, public
relations manager with L'eggs Products, says the company
won't give up the egg. "It's part of our total marketing
concept," she says.
                                                                                                       

   It's a Gas Station]
   No, It's a Seafood House]
                                                                                                       

   PUT A LOBSTER in your tank? Portland, Maine, holds a
competition to replace a prominently located, rundown Mobil
gas station.
   After the city rejected Mobil's standard design, a
revitalization group and station owner C.N. Brown Co. sought
other ideas for replacing the 40-year-old building.
Architects in 26 states submitted 160 entries. One first
prize went to William Collett of Cambridge, Mass., whose
design includes a large Pegasus (Mobil's trademark) and upper
roof elements that resemble dinosaurs and move in the wind.
   The other first prize went to Willis Pember and Andrew
Blanda of Philadelphia, who put four huge lobsters at various
heights on four oversized round canopies.
   Will any of the entries ever get built? Mobil spokesman
Thomas Collins says he sees "a certain charm to a lobster in
Maine" but adds that he's "not sure it's suitable to a Mobil
service station." Mr. Collins hastens to say that the
decision rests with the owner.
   Harold Jones, president of C.N. Brown, says his company
will "probably" use a half-dozen of the entries when it comes
time to rebuild some of the 100 gas stations it owns in New
England. The dinosaur design has possibilities, says Mr.
Jones. As for the lobsters, he says: "I don't know where I'd
go to get them made."
