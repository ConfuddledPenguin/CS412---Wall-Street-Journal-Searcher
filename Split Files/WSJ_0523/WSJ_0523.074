   FORT WORTH, Texas -- American Airlines said it reduced its
published airport-to-airport cargo rates 12% and simplified
its rate structure by going to zone pricing.
   The rate reduction, effective June 1, involves about a
third of the airline's cargo business. It doesn't apply to
its door-to-door rates, which remain unchanged.

   The airline, a unit of AMR Corp., said it was able to
reduce its rates because it flies cargo in the holds of
passenger jets. American Airlines flies 2,400 flights per
day, and the American Eagle commuter division, also a unit of
AMR Corp., flies another 1,400. "Our operating efficiency
allows us to take advantage of a full schedule of flights
daily and an extensive route system," said William R. Boesch,
vice president, cargo. Typically, cargo services operate
their fleets for a few hours a day for cargo only.
   American said it reduced its published rate structure
format to two pages, from 383 pages, by going to zone
pricing. Zone pricing, which American currently uses for
door-to-door shipments, allows a customer to use a simple
grid to determine prices based on origin, destination, weight
and container, American said.
   Separately, American said it will begin daily nonstop
service between Nashville and San Diego and Las Vegas this
July, as it expands its Nashville hub. The expansion will add
20 new jet flights a day at the hub by the end of this year,
the airline said. American currently flies 85 flights per day
out of Nashville, and plans to increase jet operations there
to about 150 flights a day by mid-1991.
