   TCS Enterprises Inc. said it anticipates "substantially"
lower earnings for the near future.
   In a statement, Tom C. Stickel, TCS chairman and chief
executive officer, said the San Diego financial services
company will report earnings for its fiscal second quarter
that ended April 30 in a few weeks. Mr. Stickel couldn't
immediately be reached to comment on the reasons for the
expected earnings decline.

   In 1989's second quarter, TCS had net income of $538,000,
or 17 cents a share, on $3.8 million of revenue.
   TCS also said it negotiated the purchase of 578,000 of its
shares held by the Resolution Trust Corp. for $867,000, or
$1.50 a share, and announced plans to buy more of its stock
in the open market.
   The RTC acquired the TCS shares when it took over Lincoln
Savings, the Irvine, Calif., thrift unit of Phoenix,
Ariz.-based American Continental Corp. TCS said it had about
three million shares outstanding prior to the repurchase.
