   TOKYO -- Maynard Toll, a managing director of CS First
Boston Inc. in New York, will become president and branch
manager of the investment bank's Japan operation, the company
said.
   Mr. Toll, head of divestitures and corporate sales in New
York, will succeed two senior executives who recently
resigned. The former chairman of the Japan operation, James
M. Walsh, and the former branch manager, Keisuke Inaba, both
resigned after the group appointed a new head of Pacific
operations, Allen D. Wheat.
