   MENLO PARK, Calif. -- A Silicon Valley venture capital
firm said it is forming an unusual alliance with a Soviet
partner aimed at developing an alternative approach toward
genetic engineering.
   The alliance will include Sierra Ventures, the venture
capital firm, the Institute of Protein Research, a Soviet
biotechnology research institute near Moscow, and closely
held RiboGene Inc., a California biotech company. Sierra
Ventures called the arrangement "the first Soviet-American
biotech start-up."

   The aim is to develop a technique for producing proteins
without using living cells. Current techniques involve
inserting genes into bacterial or mammalian cells.
Identifying single proteins from hundreds or thousands of
other proteins in such cells can be tedious and
time-consuming.
   Sierra Ventures said the Soviet institute is swapping
technology for a 15% stake in RiboGene and is also obtaining
a 49% stake in a related joint venture. Sierra Ventures said
it plans to invest as much as $2 million in RiboGene and the
joint firm.
   The venture arises out of separate research by scientists
at RiboGene and at the Soviet institute. The Soviet research
was somewhat more advanced than that of the U.S. firm. "They
had also been skillful in patenting their discoveries
world-wide," said Petri Vainio, a Sierra Ventures principal.
