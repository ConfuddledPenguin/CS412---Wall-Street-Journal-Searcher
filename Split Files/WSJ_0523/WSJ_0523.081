   LOS ANGELES -- Reed Royalty, president of the Taxpayers
Association in conservative Orange County, supports -- and
here the world almost trembles -- a tax increase.
   He's not alone. Leaders of both major political parties
and almost every established organization in the state, from
the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO, believe voters may be
prepared to take a first step -- raising taxes to repair the
state's crumbling transportation system.

   California, where the Great Tax Rebellion began 12 years
ago, may once again be a bellwether. Nervous politicians in
Washington, locked in budget negotiations, will be watching
to see what voters do here June 5. That's when Californians
go to the polls to decide if the state gasoline tax should be
doubled to 18 cents a gallon as part of an $18.5 billion
package to fix the highways and to introduce more
Californians to mass transit.
   Current revenue clearly can't support such projects. Gov.
George Deukmejian announced last week that the state faces a
$3.6 billion shortfall in revenues for the fiscal year that
begins July 1. California, unlike the federal government, is
required to balance its books; that means that without new
revenue, the state faces crippling cuts in the services it
provides.
   If it passes, and that's no sure bet, the ballot proposal,
called Proposition 111, won't solve California's budget woes,
but proponents tout it as a helpful start.
   "It accomplishes what it's supposed to accomplish," said
Mr. Royalty. "I'm for it." Mr. Royalty has the kind of high
personal expectations from Proposition 111 its supporters
hope thousands of others will share. He lives 20 miles from
his job, but some days it takes him 1 1/2 hours to get there.
   Proposition 111, one of 17 proposals on the June 5 ballot,
does more than just raise the gasoline tax nine cents (in
phases, starting with a nickel). It also lifts the spending
limits imposed in 1979 by the so-called Gann initiative, a
key victory in the state's tax revolt. That has broader
implications. It means that if Proposition 111 were applied
to the current fiscal year, state spending could be increased
at least $500 million. California's budget problem is that
revenues are growing about 6% a year but fixed program costs
are growing about 11% a year.
   Proposition 111 is joined on the ballot by other
propositions that would authorize the state to issue more
than $4 billion in general revenue bonds for new passenger
rail systems, low-income housing, new prisons, new school and
college construction, and earthquake protection for old
state-owned buildings. Most of these propositions were put on
the ballot by the Legislature.
   No one -- not Republican Pete Wilson or Democrats Dianne
Feinstein and John Van de Kamp, the gubernatorial candidates
-- proposes the elimination of the Gann spending limits. But
they all support Proposition 111 as one way to spend more,
especially in targeted areas the voters seem ready to
approve.
   It is, a small band of critics suggests, the camel's nose
under the tent.
   "Proposition 111 is the first necessary step for an agenda
of ever greater taxes in California," contended Arthur
Laffer, a La Jolla economic consultant and supply-side guru.
"It will virtually destroy the restraining power of the Gann
limit."
   What's happening here is a mini-drama running concurrently
with a larger showdown in Washington, where Democratic
congressional leaders are locked in budget negotiations with
President Bush, who has given hints that he may be willing to
back down on his promise that he wouldn't support new taxes.
   If Californians are ready to raise their taxes -- here in
the state where the anti-tax fever began -- maybe, it is
thought, nervous politicians elsewhere can emerge from their
hiding holes and vote for new spending.
   Maybe. This is a ballot proposal supported by all the
generals, and nobody really knows what the troops down in the
trenches think. It could be defeated, and legislators would
then lose heart. In any scenario, given the fact that program
costs are growing faster than revenues and a ceiling on
spending will continue to exist, legislators would be forced
to cut deeply into vulnerable state services.
   But if Proposition 111 goes down, panic is the likely
result among elected leaders. Alan Post, for many years the
state's leading budget analyst, fears things might get so bad
that schools and universities would be forced to close their
doors for part of the school year. "It's getting awfully
rough," he said.
   Californians, 30 million of them now, were once the golden
optimists in U.S. society. But now they feel buffeted by
change, and most of them don't like it. "It doesn't matter
who they vote for," said Mervin Field, the pollster, "because
they still see crime increasing, the war on drugs being lost,
educational standards going down, the environment more
fouled, housing becoming less affordable, health care more
costly, transportation in gridlock, homelessness increasing."
   It is a state that will have a non-white majority early in
the next century, but blacks, Hispanics and Asians aren't
very active participants in the political process. Those who
go to the polls tend to be older, more educated and to have
higher incomes, according to Mr. Field.
   And, he added, "the more that nonvoters become different
from voters in color, in class, and attitudes toward life, we
create and build threatening pressures which could easily
explode and alter for the worse the future course of our
precious democracy."
   "It is only the elites who are still voting," said former
Gov. Jerry Brown, now the Democratic state chairman.
   Because of that, Mr. Brown argued with echoes of his
campaign rhetoric, "both the Democrats and the Republicans
have fixated on anti-government and anti-taxation as their
political mantra. It's brought them success. It means that
anything that would expand the state's social welfare is
undervalued."
   Thus, unable to agree about very much among themselves,
the state's political leaders, individually and collectively,
go about their business by writing propositions instead of
legislation and permit what's left of the electorate to
decide the results.
   Mr. Laffer remains confident about this California
electorate. He believes the California tax rebellion is alive
and well and that voters will reject higher taxes and
increased spending. If they don't, he warned, property values
will collapse and the state's unemployment rate, currently
5.3%, will rise 1 1/2 percentage points. "The power to tax,"
he said, "is the power to destroy."
