   CHICAGO -- Most people who successfully stop smoking
cigarettes do it without help from formal programs; they are
most likely to quit if they stop "cold turkey," according to
a new study.
   In analyzing the results of a 1986 telephone survey
conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control,
researchers found that about 48% of those interviewed, who
quit smoking during the previous 10 years, had done so on
their own; while only 24% of those who quit were helped by a
smoking cessation program or by using nicotine gum.

   Researchers at the University of Wisconsin said their
findings, published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, were also important because the survey
found that 30% of people who had smoked during the previous
year had tried to kick the habit. If this were true for the
entire U.S. population, it would mean that 17 million people
each year try to quit smoking, but that only 1.3 million of
them are successful. The researchers said their report was
the first to determine which methods seemed to work for most
people.
   The researchers found that about 70% of people who tried
to quit had done so at the urging of their doctors, while
only 46% of all the smokers said their physicians advised
them to stop. The researchers said that while formal programs
were helpful for some people, advice designed to help people
quit on their own might be more useful for most people who
are thinking about quitting.
