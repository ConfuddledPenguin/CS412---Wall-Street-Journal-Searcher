   SUMMER AND SMOKES? That season or any will do for raising
a cigarette tax.
   As revenue needs rise, more legislators and officials say
this sin tax makes sense. Budget summiteers savor last week's
estimate that doubling the federal tax to 32 cents a pack
could raise $13.8 billion over five years. That's a yield
that states are cultivating. On Jan. 1, 1989, California's
tax shot up to 35 cents from 10; the rise is dedicated to
health care and education related to tobacco use. Cigarette
sales in 1989 fell 14% there to 2.18 billion packs -- but tax
revenue tripled to $764.4 million.

   In 1989, 13 states enacted increases ranging from one cent
in Oregon to 13 in Alaska, Maine and North Dakota; 14 in
Connecticut, and 15 in Nevada, the Tobacco Institute says.
This year: New Hampshire added another four-cent increase on
top of last year's, lifting its tax to 25 cents. Hawaii's
Legislature passed a 40-cent tax -- effective next Jan. 1, if
the governor approves it -- that would match Connecticut's as
the U.S.'s largest. On June 1, New York is to raise its tax
to 39 cents a pack from 33.
   After 1990 defeats for increases in 17 states, 14 still
have proposals pending.
                                                                                                       

   EMBEZZLEMENT IT WAS, but cheating on taxes it wasn't,
appeals judges say.
   In 1984, a federal grand jury charged Louis Salerno and
Frederick Pandolfo, casino bosses at Las Vegas's Stardust
Hotel, and its parent with siphoning off millions of dollars
in a scheme to falsify company returns. But the embezzlement
charges didn't belong in federal court. The charges against
the company and most of those against the men were dropped in
1986. The two were tried and convicted only of aiding the
preparation of false company returns.
   But now a ninth-circuit appeals panel has overturned those
convictions. The government proved an embezzlement and tied
Salerno and Pandolfo to it, wrote Judge Schroeder, yet never
showed they or the scheme had anything to do with the
preparation of company returns or that the men "willfully"
intended to have the company file false returns. "The filing
of the corporate return appears irrelevant to the defendants'
conduct," the judge declared.
                                                                                                       

   STATES PRESS out-of-state retailers for sales taxes,
despite legal setbacks.
   States say they lose $3 billion a year because many
out-of-state retailers won't collect sales taxes for them.
But two of three recent state-court decisions have rebuffed
new state laws meant to get around a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court
holding on which merchants rely to avoid collecting taxes.
Last week, North Dakota lost a decision to Quill Corp. of
Lincolnshire, Ill.; the state will appeal to its Supreme
Court. A month ago, Connecticut lost a test case brought by
SFA Folio Collections Inc. of New York.
   Connecticut is appealing that decision and an earlier loss
to Calley Curtis Co. of California. Also last month,
Tennessee overcame a challenge by L.L. Bean of Maine. These
and other cases may well reach the U.S. high court as states
try to reverse or narrow its 1967 ruling. California and
Minnesota also are among the most aggressive tax collectors;
but 31 of the 45 states with sales taxes have enacted laws
aimed at out-of-state retailers, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   New York's reciprocal enforcement efforts with Connecticut
and New Jersey have netted $107 million for them.
                                                                                                       

   DEFLATED is Winooski, Vt.'s attempt to tax neighboring
Burlington for encroaching on the air space over Winooski.
Vermont's Supreme Court rejected a claim that aircraft using
Burlington International Airport ride on "imaginary surfaces"
that are taxable as Winooski real estate.
                                                                                                       

   VIETNAM VETS who were exposed to Agent Orange, and their
survivors, aren't taxable on personal-injury payments from
the court-administered Agent Orange Settlement Fund, IRS
release IR-90-79 says. About 60,000 veterans are eligible for
payments.
                                                                                                       

   CONNECTICUT IS LEVYING its capital-gains tax on
nonresident individuals who sell Connecticut real estate.
Sellers must pay estimated taxes by June 15 if 1990 gains
reach $2,000 by May 31. Before, only residents were taxed on
real-estate gains.
                                                                                                       

   A MEDICAL SOCIETY doctors a rental deal to fatten its own
finances.
   The unidentified exempt society occupies a building
registered as historic for its architecture. In 1980, when
the building needed renovation, the society formed an exempt
preservation charity and conveyed the building to it in
return for a rent-free, 50-year lease on the first floor. The
charity, controlled by the society's officers, renovated the
rest of the building and rents secondfloor meeting rooms and
facilities to charitable and non-charitable groups. The
society may use those rooms free.
   But the IRS took a closer look at the deal when an auditor
challenged the preservation charity's exemption. Now private
ruling 9017003 says the terms are far more favorable to the
society than to the charity. Indeed, it says, the charity has
been operated for the private benefit of the society and its
members. So the IRS has revoked the preservation charity's
exemption, effective as of the ruling.
   In addition, the charity is subject to tax on most of the
income it received before the revocation date.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Interest on overdue taxes will stay at 11% in the
third quarter, IRS Revenue Ruling 90-47 says. The rate on
overdue refunds will remain 10%. . . . Connecticut plans to
waive penalties and prosecutions for delinquents who pay up
during a three-month tax amnesty starting Sept. 1.
