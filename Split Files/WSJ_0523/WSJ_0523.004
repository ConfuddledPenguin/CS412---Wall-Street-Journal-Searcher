   DALLAS -- In a maneuver that further clouds the future of
troubled Greyhound Lines Inc., the union representing
striking Greyhound employees has made an unconditional offer
to return to work.
   But instead of being an earnest effort to end the
often-violent walkout that began March 2, Amalgamated Transit
Union officials acknowledged that the action was a legal
tactic aimed at setting the stage for a potentially huge
back-pay claim against the struggling unit of GLI Holding Co.

   The offer, made in a letter to the company, comes one week
after the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint
alleging that Greyhound had engaged in an unfair labor
practice in contract negotiations with the ATU.
   Greyhound has promised to fight that complaint through the
federal courts if necessary, but if unfair bargaining
practices and not economic issues are ultimately found to
have caused the strike, the company could be forced to rehire
striking drivers and pay them for time lost during the
strike.
   "In order to start the clock on back pay running, we have
to make an unconditional offer to return to work," said Earle
Putnam, ATU general counsel. "That is what the (union) has
done."
   "They have done what was smart and that's a first," said
P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound executive vice president and
chief labor negotiator. He estimated the company's back pay
liability at about $13.6 million a month.
   Mr. Lannie said Greyhound would offer its remaining job
openings to striking union members under the terms of a May 5
contract offer rejected by the union. "But the bottom line is
that we just don't have many vacancies left," he said.
   Since the strike by 9,400 ATU members began, Greyhound has
struggled to operate a slightly smaller regular-route system
with a work force that now includes 598 union drivers who
crossed picket lines and 3,177 newly hired replacement
drivers.
   Although Greyhound could need as many as 500 additional
drivers in the event of a busy summer travel season, company
spokesman George Gravley said Greyhound has openings for only
108 full-time drivers now, and 98 of those positions are part
of a local transit contract that expires July 1.
   The union's offer comes a day after Greyhound said it
would offer to redeem about $191 million in face amount of
debt for about $86 million. Some bond analysts said the
union's move could make it more difficult for debt-burdened
Greyhound, which has already suffered huge losses from the
strike, to finance the tender offer.
   "It does have a negative impact on the company's ability
to raise the financing," said Leigh Walzer, a bond analyst
with R.D. Smith &amp; Co. "Now, anyone who would put the new
money into Greyhound, aside from the other economic risks
they face, has to worry about a back-pay claim that the union
could win down the road."
