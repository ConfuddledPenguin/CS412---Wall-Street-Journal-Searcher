   NEW YORK -- It's not over, it seems, 'til it's over.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., the collapsed brokerage
firm, says it plans to soon propose to the federal bankruptcy
court that it remain in business, of an undisclosed nature.

   One reason: To prop the near-worthless stock that Drexel's
1,000 shareholders currently hold. Another: To provide a
vehicle for big tax-loss carry-forwards, which Drexel amassed
before it collapsed, and which could be used to lower the tax
bite on future profits. Unable to finance its deteriorating
pile of junk bonds, Drexel filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in February.
   Currently, the firm has a staff of about 600, out of the
5,300 it employed before it filed for bankruptcy-law
protection. The firm still has more than $1 billion in assets
and about $300 million in equity, a spokesman said.
   Since its collapse, Drexel has been liquidating its
portfolio and getting out of securities businesses. It has
also sold its junk-bond client data base and customer lists.
And in three weeks, the firm plans to auction its office
furniture, personal computers and other items, including five
corporate cafeterias, kitchen fixtures and appliances.
