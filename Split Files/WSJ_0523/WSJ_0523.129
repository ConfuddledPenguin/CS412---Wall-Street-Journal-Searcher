   NEWSPAPERS: Hearst Corp. is joining with Izvestia, a
Soviet newspaper, to publish an "uncensored" weekly paper. A
prototype issue, to be published July 4, will be edited by
Soviet and U.S. journalists. Hearst said 25,000 copies will
be distributed to "key" government, business and education
leaders in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Washington, D.C., and
other U.S. cities.
