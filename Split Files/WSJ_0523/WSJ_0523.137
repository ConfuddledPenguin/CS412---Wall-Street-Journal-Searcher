   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund said
Thailand accepted IMF rules relating to currency
convertibility.
   Bangkok agreed to refrain from imposing restrictions on
the use of its currency, the baht, for international
payments. It also agreed to refrain from engaging in
discriminatory currency arrangements or from using multiple
exchange rates for its currency without IMF approval.

   By accepting obligations under Article VIII of the IMF
charter, "Thailand gives confidence to the international
community that it will pursue sound economic policies that
will obviate the need to use exchange and payments
restrictions on current transactions, and thereby enhances
its contribution to a multilateral payments system free of
restrictions," the IMF said.
   The IMF currently has 152 member countries, including 68
industrial nations and developing countries that have
accepted the commitment to maintain convertibility of their
currencies in current-account international payment
transactions.
