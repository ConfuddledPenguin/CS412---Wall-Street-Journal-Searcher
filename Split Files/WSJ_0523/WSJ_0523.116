   Computer Associates International Inc. said net income in
the fourth quarter ended March 31 rose 58%, as the Garden
City, N.Y., company began to recover from problems in merging
with Cullinet Software Inc., acquired in September.
   Net rose to $66.9 million, or 36 cents a share, from $42.4
million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
1.6% to $363.7 million from $357.8 million. The 1989 figures
have been restated to reflect the Cullinet acquisition on a
pooling-of-interests basis.

that most of the issues surrounding the acquisition of
Cullinet are now behind us."

$157.8 million, or 85 cents a share, from $130.3 million, or

$1.3 billion from $1.23 billion.
