   NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to
yet another all-time high.
   The 30-stock average closed 7.55 higher at 2852.23,
following a record close Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 816 to 689, on the New York Stock Exchange where
volume was a heavy 203,350,000 shares.

   Broader averages are getting closer to record highs:
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.43 to 358.43, a
notch below the record close of 359.80 set on Oct. 9, 1989.
The Big Board's composite index, which yesterday rose 0.30 to
195.58, has a bit farther to go to reach its record of
199.34, also set Oct. 9.
   Are traders pleased with all this?
   "I assure you we are not happy," said Chung Lew, head
trader at Kleinwort Benson North America Inc. Mr. Lew said
that most trading desks have been selling positions to take
profits, only to watch stocks go higher the next day.
Speculators betting on a decline in stocks are having to buy
those positions back at a loss as the market moves up.
"Clients are being forced in because they can't justify their
cash positions with a market like this," said Mr. Lew. "They
are reluctant buyers."
   Such crosscurrents are certainly making the stock market
more volatile. A bond market rally yesterday morning helped
the industrial average soar more than 20 points in early
trading, with stock-index arbitrage buy programs adding fuel
to the rally. In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell
stocks and offset the position in futures to lock in price
differences.
   But as market measures soared some favored stocks such as
Compaq tumbled on profit-taking. Eventually, the selling
washed over the whole market and took the Dow average into a
loss around noon and at several other points during the day.
   One catalyst for the profit-taking was Federal Express,
which plunged in a delayed opening in early trading. Federal
Express closed down 5 1/8 to 47 on more than two million
shares. Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said a number
of analysts cut their earnings estimates for the stock after
looking at the company's April volume figures.
   Federal Express, some analysts say, may be the first sign
of some of the bad earnings news that's in store for the
stock market in the weeks ahead. "When Federal Express has
earnings problems, everybody has earnings problems," said
Michael Murphy, senior analyst at the Overpriced Stock
Service, an advisory firm and money manager based in San
Francisco.
   Mr. Murphy said Federal Express's volume figures are
reflecting slow domestic economic growth. And on that score,
he is bearish on a number of companies whose profits are tied
to U.S. business activity, such as Nordstrom, Disney and
Circuit City Stores.
   "Companies who have a high overseas component {to their
earnings} will do all right," said Mr. Murphy, who includes
"classic deep cyclical" stocks in that category, such as
paper and chemical issues as well as some technology stocks.
But companies "exposed to domestic economic activity will not
have a good quarter," he added.
   Among other transportation issues, UAL fell 2 1/4 to 151
1/2. Declines in UAL and Federal Express helped sink the Dow
Jones Transportation average 11.20 points to 1169.63.
   Where are stocks going? Arthur Cashin, director of Big
Board floor operations for PaineWebber, said institutional
money managers still have the potential to push stocks higher
if the averages keep climbing and entice them to buy. "In
this kind of market a billion dollars or two could move
prices tremendously," he said, "and there's a lot more than
that sitting out there."
   Nova led the most active list, retracing some of its
1/2-point advance of Monday. The stock, which was also the
market's most active stock Monday, fell 3/8 to 7 on volume of
more than 3.9 million shares.
   Late Monday, Italian firm Enimont S.p.A. complained that
Nova "didn't respect the bidding rules established" in
agreeing to sell its rubber division to Bayer AG. The 1.25
billion Canadian dollar (US$1.06 billion) sale was announced
Monday. Enimont said it had been scheduled to make its bid
Monday, but was pre-empted by the proposed sale to Bayer.
   Computer Associates International was also high on the
active list, easing 3/8 to 15 1/2 on volume of more than 2.3
million shares. The company announced fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings of 36 cents a share, up from last year's 23 cents a
share, but at the low end of expectations. According to Zacks
Corporate Earnings Estimator, 13 analysts surveyed forecast
fourth-quarter earnings ranging from 36 cents to 44 cents a
share. The company has also declared an initial dividend of
five cents a share.
   Wyle Laboratories rose 2 to 14. The company said it
expects its first-quarter profit to be up threefold over the
10 cents a share earned a year ago. Meanwhile, Smith Barney
Harris Upham upgraded its opinion on the stock and raised
earnings estimates for the firm.
   Apparent profit-taking hit Compaq Computer, knocking it
down 2 to 119 3/8. The stock rallied 2 3/4 Monday.
   Procter &amp; Gamble rose 1 1/2 to 79 1/8. The stock added 1
1/8 Monday after the company's executives told analysts in
Cincinnati that its earnings will show strong growth in 1990.
   Pioneer Financial Services added 1 1/2 to 20 1/4, a new
52-week high for the stock. The company's executives were
making presentations to institutional investors in Boston
yesterday. Monday, the company met with investors in New
York.
   Vague takeover rumors circulated around Timken, which
gained 1 7/8 to 35 1/8. USA Today columnist Dan Dorfman said
Monday night on Cable News Network's "Moneyline" that
Britain's BTR might be interested in acquiring Timken. Timken
officials said it is company policy to decline to respond to
rumors. Some analysts who follow the company said Timken is
an unlikely takeover candidate because of the amount of stock
held by the Timken family and other shareholders friendly to
management. Dillon Read raised its rating on the stock
yesterday.
   Golden Valley Microwave Foods added 1 3/4 to 37 5/8. Smith
Barney Harris Upham and Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood both
reiterated "buy" recommendations on the stock following the
company's annual meeting Monday. At the meeting, the company
declared a 3-for-2 stock split and authorized the buy-back of
as many as one million shares on a pre-split basis.
   Archer-Daniels-Midland added 3/8 to 25 1/4. Key House
lawmakers have agreed on provisions that would require the
use of cleaner gasoline in the nation's smoggiest areas. The
clean-air legislation would mean a boon for Archer-Daniels
and others that make additives used to produce cleaner
gasoline.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.49
to 359.85. Volume totaled 15,820,000 shares.
