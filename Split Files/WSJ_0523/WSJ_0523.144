   Celebrity endorsements are spiraling out of control. Coke
and Pepsi have lined up so many famous faces that confusion
is rife over who is shilling for whom. So what have
advertisers learned from the celebrity overload?
   Not much, if the athletic-shoe business is any indication.
This week, L.A. Gear is planning to announce that it has
signed up former Reebok pitchwoman Paula Abdul to its stable
of stars, which already includes Michael Jackson. Reebok
itself is in negotiations with pop star Madonna, and its ad
agency is already preparing Madonna commercials, an executive
close to the company says. Both sneaker brands also have a
full complement of big-name athletes on their endorsement
roster, competing with Nike, whose ads just this year have
included more than a dozen sports figures, most prominently
Bo Jackson.

   The escalating celebrity war is boosting the price of
competing in the athletic-shoe business. Michael Jackson's
multiyear deal with L.A. Gear alone is valued at more than
$10 million in cash, stock and royalties, according to
industry executives. Other big names can command in the $5
million-to-$10 million range. The sneaker companies generally
guarantee the stars a multimillion-dollar fee plus a
percentage of sales.
   As the celebrity sparring proliferates, though, it
threatens to turn athletic shoes into a commodity, making
different brands seem interchangeable, critics charge. "It
gets very confusing, says Ron Berger, whose ad agency Messner
Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer handles New Balance sneakers,
which don't use celebrities. "Where does the confusion end
when you can't remember who wears what? And is it important?
The more celebrities that get involved, the more it's going
to get out of hand."
   Celebrity sneaker ads are so common that "now, I think
it's cluttered," agrees Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst with
Kidder Peabody. "When Nike first did it with Michael Jordan
and Air Jordan, it was a huge success. But now there are so
many . . . I don't think it makes a lot of difference any
more. The sneaker companies need to take a riskier approach."
   The athletic-shoe companies defend their celebrity fixes,
saying the matchups make sense. Nike, the market leader with
26% of the sneaker market compared with Reebok's 24%, notes
that it only uses athletes, who stress its shoes'
performance. "Our mission is to link the athlete with the
sport with our shoe. If you can do that, it isn't overkill at
all," says a Nike spokeswoman. Nike avoids entertainers, she
adds, "because any time I've seen Paula Abdul, she's wearing
spike heels. That doesn't convince me she prefers one
{sneaker} brand over another."
   L.A. Gear and Reebok executives couldn't be reached to
comment on their celebrities, but clearly they are trying to
stand out in the harshly competitive business of $5.5 billion
a year in wholesale terms. Reebok, which had led the pack in
1988, lost the lead to Nike in 1989 but has been gaining.
L.A. Gear is expanding aggressively, now accounting for 15%
of the market. Kidder's Mr. Jacobson believes the top three
will continue to dominate, growing to 68% of the market next
year from 65% this year and 59% in 1989.
   Yet as the major sneaker companies rely more heavily on
celebrities, they're coming to resemble nothing so much as
the soft drink industry. That's a troubling role model, some
industry executives contend: While the soft drinks are so
similar that they have to rely on image to differentiate
them, the athletic shoes do have real differences -- and
those differences may be obscured by the celebrity onslaught.
   With athletic shoes, "there is more to sell than imagery.
Certain running shoes perform better than others," Mr. Berger
notes. Yet with the overflow of celebrities these days, he
says, "marketing is driving the sales much more than the
quality of the product."
   So exaggerated has the sneaker business's reliance on
celebrities become that New Balance is even poking fun of the
fixation in its own new ads. "Endorsed by no one," is the
headline over a picture of a new basketball shoe in ads
breaking this week. The shoe is "the lightest performance
basketball shoe in the world," the ad claims. "Maybe that's
why 38 NBA players are now wearing them. It certainly isn't
because we're paying them a ton of money to appear in our
ads."

   No Excuses Gets Maples
                                                                                                       

   No Excuses jeans, which has a tiny ad budget but gets
loads of publicity from its celebrity spokesmen, is expected
to announce today that model Marla Maples has signed to
become its newest spokeswoman. Ms. Maples, the alleged
girlfriend of Donald Trump, is expected to announce at a news
conference that she agreed to appear in ads for the jeans
maker after the company said it would match her contribution
to the Better World Society, an environmental group.
   No Excuses' ad campaigns have spotlighted a number of
celebrities whose personal lives have become the subject of
tabloid headlines. Stars featured in past ads include Donna
Rice and Joan Rivers.
