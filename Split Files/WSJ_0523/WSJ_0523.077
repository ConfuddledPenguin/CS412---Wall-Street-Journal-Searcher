   One of the bedrock assumptions of life in America is that
when you turn on the faucet, water will come out. And that
you can pretty much use as much water as you desire because
there's so much of it and it's so cheap, almost free. Not
everyone believes that now in California, which is in the
fourth year of a severe drought.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley recently announced a
water-rationing program. Some of it resembles the crisis
conservation program New York City and other Northeastern
towns tried a few years ago during a long drought. Maybe
there's a better way to manage "public" water, so that huge
populations of people don't suddenly wake up to discover that
they and their wasteful ways have caused a "crisis."

   These problems recur in large part because public
authorities tend to think that water mixes with marketset
prices about as well as it does with oil. Water is handed out
like, well, as the saying goes, "like it was water." Hidden
subsidies to many of the nation's big users of water actually
distort the market for this commodity. John Boland, a Johns
Hopkins University professor recognized for work in water
economics, observes, "We persist in selling water for less
than it costs." No wonder we're so frequently left high and
dry.
   After years of bitter fights over water resources, the
political system is beginning to find its way toward a
rational solution. (There are still places, such as Santa
Monica, Calif., that create fines for people who fail to
insert flow restricters in their homes.) Most places are
discovering that the price mechanism does a better job of
discouraging profligate consumption.
   Even so, the pop environmental movement continues to
target the water villain who "wastes" water. People are made
to feel that they are committing a crime against society
because they "waste" resources, such as gasoline or
electricity or even landfill space.
   The local water authorities' first line of attack against
these "cheaters" is often a use surcharge, imposed above some
historical base. Of course, some public authority decides
what's wasting and what isn't. Ultimately, the wasters are
tracked down by inspectors and perhaps ticketed, as is now
done in Santa Barbara and elsewhere. But then because a
hard-and-fast cutoff would impose hardships on users with
changed circumstances, such as a growing business, the
authorities typically offer exemptions that are also
arbitrary.
   This is a silly routine, especially when used by a place
such as New York City, which hadn't even bothered to meter
for water previously. Why not try to balance supply and
demand for such a widely used resource by relying on
market-driven changes in its price? Consider gasoline. During
the energy "crisis" people idled in gas lines. Now gas
shortages are unheard of. That's because the decontrol of
energy prices made life normal again at the gasoline pump.
   Admittedly, this analogy isn't perfect. A tough barrier,
according to Johns Hopkins' Mr. Boland, is that even with
honest prices, people living through a drought may change
habits slowly. Unlike gasoline, water is billed well after
it's been used, so the eventual cost may not be associated
with outrageous excesses. Most adjustments take longer -- a
year or so to change landscaping practices, longer to replace
appliances. By then the drought condition may have ended or
eased, and the old wasteful system trickles back into place
(though there are indications that a permanent "life style
change" is coming to Southern California).
   Also, because water isn't close to being a competitive
industry, it's hard to arrive at the proper clearing price
for water. If drought brings higher prices, the extra revenue
may in the end only expand the bureaucracy, which tends to
find "other" things to do when given more money.
   Other utilities such as natural gas or electricity share
some of these problems, but many are shareholder-owned and
work fairly well if exposed to market forces. Maggie Thatcher
is moving in the proper direction by trying to privatize
water service.
   In the meantime, water sales between jurisdictions are one
important step. Sales from the Imperial Valley farm region of
California to urban users are a model.
   Perestroika has its place even in America. Resources, such
as water, are often an unpriced wilderness. Environmentalists
too often try to preserve these resources by simply
discouraging their use. A better way might be to recognize
that ownership and pricing serve to protect and conserve.
What better place for the U.S. to start tapping into
capitalism's proven success again than in the allocation of
water? Droughts may recur but there's little reason why a
mood of public panic and crisis policies must inevitably
follow.
