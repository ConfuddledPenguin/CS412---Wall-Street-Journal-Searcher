   TREASURY CHIEF BRADY will ask Congress today for massive
new borrowing authority to finance the S&amp;L bailout, officials
said. The secretary is expected to acknowledge that his
department badly underestimated the cost of the thrift rescue
and to seek authority to borrow $80 billion to $140 billion.
The new estimates could put the bailout's total cost to
taxpayers at $300 billion over 10 years.
