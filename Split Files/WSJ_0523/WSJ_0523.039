   A tentative labor contract covering 2,000 workers at
Kennecott Corp.'s Bingham Canyon mine in Utah could set a
precedent for future labor negotiations in the nation's
copper industry.
   Kennecott agreed to a new three-year labor accord,
effective July 1, that will boost pay about 20% for workers
at its mine in Salt Lake City.

   Analysts say the partial restoration of past lost wages
agreed to in the new contract is likely to set a pattern as
rivals Phelps Dodge Corp. and Asarco Inc. begin negotiating
contracts later this year. Labor pacts covering 3,550 workers
at Kennecott, a unit of London-based RTZ Corp., Phelps Dodge
and Asarco all expire June 30.
   The new contract reflects better times in the copper
industry, which was virtually at a standstill when the
current pact was negotiated in 1986. At that time,
Kennecott's Bingham Canyon site, the nation's largest
open-pit copper mine, was closed. The mine was reopened in
July 1986 when the union agreed to concessions.
   Kennecott has since undergone extensive restructuring,
mirroring similar actions by other U.S. copper producers. It
sold four mines, closed another and only has one copper site
left at Bingham Canyon, in addition to gold, silver and lead
properties elsewhere. Kennecott was acquired by RTZ last
year.
   The Kennecott contract covers members of the United
Steelworkers union, the bargaining agent, as well as 12 other
smaller unions. Members will vote tomorrow on the accord,
which has been in negotiation for about a month and a half.
   In the first year of the contract, beginning July 1, wages
will increase to about $12 an hour from roughly $10
currently. The present contract lowered average hourly wages
to about $10 from roughly $13.75 in 1986 when the
concessionary pact took effect.
   Union officials declined to provide further details on the
wage settlement pending the worker vote. However, wage
increases are expected to average about 50 cents annually
during the second and third years, according to published
reports.
   Wayne Holland, a USW sub-district director in Salt Lake
City, predicted employee ratification, though he said workers
had expected about 50 cents more an hour. "We were looking
for all that was given to us in 1986," Mr. Holland said,
referring to full restoration of the givebacks that Kennecott
won then.
   In addition to the basic-wage package, Kennecott agreed to
lower the health-insurance deductible to $100 for each
person, or $300 for each family. The agreement also provides
for an increase in pension benefit coverage, which wasn't
disclosed, as well as a $3,000 signing bonus for each worker
to be paid within 60 days after the contract is ratified.
   Don Babinchak, who represented Salt Lake City-based
Kennecott in the labor talks, called the contract an
"excellent settlement for our employees."
