   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Schering AG, the West German
chemicals and pharmaceutical group, said the expected merger
of its big agrochemicals business with that of Switzerland's
Sandoz AG has been called off.
   In an unexpected announcement, Schering cited last-minute
complications in talks over the joint venture. Both companies
recently had indicated the agrochemical merger was imminent.

   A Schering spokeswoman said the talks collapsed after
Sandoz sought to expand the planned joint venture into
business cooperation across the board. Officials of the West
German company hinted that when agreement couldn't be reached
on a full-scale linkup, Sandoz shied away from going through
with a merger of just agrochemicals.
   Sandoz officials declined to specify what the last-minute
objections were that led to calling off the agreement. But a
spokeswoman said Schering's claim that the deal was killed
because Sandoz demanded a broader agreement wasn't a view
shared by Sandoz.
