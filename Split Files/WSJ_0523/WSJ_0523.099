   MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines said it will close the sale of
its Latin American routes to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines
unit in four stages between June 30 and Aug. 14.
   The first closing will be the routes to Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, Guatemala and Costa Rica. On July 20, Panama, Peru,
Bolivia and Paraguay route sales will close. Colombia and
Ecuador will close on July 31 and Belize, Honduras, El
Salvador and Venezuela on Aug. 14. American will begin
serving its new routes as the sales are completed.

   Eastern said it would receive the bulk of the $310 million
purchase price from American in July and August. Originally,
the sale price was $349 million, but Eastern and American are
still negotiating one aspect of the transaction involving
ground facilities in Puerto Rico valued at about $25 million.
Also, the initial purchase price was reduced by another $14
million after the U.S. Transportation Department declined to
approve American's purchase of the Miami-Toronto and
Tampa-Toronto routes from Eastern.
   Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy-court
protection since March 1989, was a unit of Texas Air Corp.
until a federal bankruptcy judge gave control of the carrier
to a court-appointed trustee last month.
