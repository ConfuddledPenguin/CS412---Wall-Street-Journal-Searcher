   BRUSSELS -- Renault S.A. won a long-running battle as the
European Community Commission allowed the state-owned auto
maker to keep half of a 12 billion franc ($2.13 billion)
government bailout.
   The commission said Renault would immediately have to pay
back only 3.5 billion francs to the French government, while
an additional 2.5 billion francs would be listed on its books
as long-term debt. That's a big scale-down from the 8.4
billion franc pay-back originally sought by EC Competition
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.

   Moreover, French government officials indicated that they
may compensate for Renault's loss by injecting more money
into the company next year in the form of a capital increase.
   Paris welcomed the compromise and said that France will
feel free to return as much money as it wishes to the
state-owned company. "We can do what we want in function of
what we think is in Renault's interest and in the interest of
its shareholders," French Industry Minister Roger Fauroux
said.
   As part of the accord with the commission, the French
government won't inject any more money into Renault before
next year, when the Swedish auto maker AB Volvo is to buy a
20% stake in the company. Volvo is expected to participate in
any capital boost -- a move which Sir Leon said would offer a
guarantee that the cash injection is a legitimate business
investment, and not an illegal state handout.
