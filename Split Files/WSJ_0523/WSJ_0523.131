   THE HOUSE APPROVED sweeping rights legislation for the
disabled.
   Voting 403-20, the chamber passed the Americans With
Disabilities Act, which gives equal access to employment,
transportation and buildings to about 43 million people in
the U.S. with physical or mental disabilities. The act is
viewed as the most sweeping civil-rights measure in over 25
years. The Senate has cleared similar legislation. After a
House-Senate conference to resolve differences, Bush is
expected to sign the bill into law.
