   PITTSBURGH -- A federal appeals court here ruled that any
employer with more than 15 workers must provide a man with
unpaid child-rearing leave if that benefit is offered to
female co-workers.
   The decision by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is
only binding in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and the
Virgin Islands, but is likely to be influential on federal
trial courts nationally.

   The ruling could have far-reaching implications, affecting
thousands of U.S. employers who offer parental leave benefits
but traditionally provide such options to women only. Though
an estimated 37% of employers with 100 workers or more offer
parental leave, Congress is currently considering a family-
and medical-leave bill that would provide broader coverage.
   The appeals court found that the Pittsburgh Board of
Education discriminated against teacher Gerald Schafer by
denying him a one-year unpaid leave to take care of his son.
The unpaid-leave benefit was included in a union contract but
had only been used by women and was specifically denied to
Mr. Schafer in 1981. The court ruled that the board violated
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex or
race discrimination by employers with more than 15 workers.
   "This says an employer can't give benefits like
child-rearing leave to one sex and not another," said Edward
Feinstein of the Pittsburgh law firm Begler, Kowall &amp; Ombres,
who represented Mr. Schafer.
   The appeals court's finding doesn't mean that fathers are
entitled to sick leave or disability benefits. Rather, the
three-judge panel said in its opinion, "If mothers can have
child-rearing obligations immediately upon the birth of their
child, then fathers also are entitled to exercise the option
of using child-rearing leave immediately upon the birth of
their child."
   Michele Lord, senior research associate of the Family and
Work Institute, said: "This sends a clear message that
fathers ought to try to enforce their rights under Title
VII." Few courts, she pointed out, have enforced the rights
of fathers regarding child care.
   Barbara Berish Brown, an employment-law specialist for the
Washington firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, said the
finding may surprise employers. She suspects many employers
allow women to take leave beyond the period of physical
disability, but men, asking for a similar leave, would run
into opposition.
   Yet while the ruling is significant legally, she said, "in
real life I wonder how many men will ask to take advantage of
child-rearing leave."
   Donna Lenhoff, legal director of the Women's Legal Defense
Fund, said the ruling also underscores the need for states
and the federal government to adopt gender-neutral leave
policies when considering parental leaves, as well as family
and medical leaves.
   In the Schafer case, the school board unsuccessfully
argued that the leave was a maternity benefit and that Mr.
Schafer, not having been disabled by the birth process,
wasn't entitled to the leave.
   Mr. Schafer resigned his position as a special-education
teacher when alternative child-care arrangements fell
through. He filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in 1982.
   In 1987, a concent decree was signed in which the school
agreed to grant leaves to men in the collective-bargaining
agreement. However, the school didn't admit that it had
violated Title VII, and didn't offer any back pay.
   Mr. Schafer is seeking back pay, an issue the appeals
court remanded back to the district court to determine
whether he had any other alternative short of resignation. If
not, he could receive back pay.
