   TORRANCE, Calif. -- American Republic Bancorp said its
president and chief executive officer, John B. O'Donnell, who
also held those titles at its Republic Bank unit, resigned.
   In a brief statement, American Republic said Mr. O'Donnell
also resigned as a director of both American Republic and
Republic Bank. The company quoted Mr. O'Donnell as saying in
a letter to the two boards that he was resigning because he
"may have inadvertently engaged in activities which appear
inconsistent with company policy."

   American Republic didn't specify the policy, but the
statement said the bank didn't suffer any losses as a result
of such activities. It added, however, that both boards still
felt it to be in the best interests of the company and the
bank to accept Mr. O'Donnell's resignation, effective
immediately.
   Neither Mr. O'Donnell nor his attorney could be reached
for comment.
   Thomas E. Malloy, chairman of the bank and the holding
company, will also serve as acting president and chief
executive of American Republic and Republic Bank while the
boards conduct a search to fill those posts, the company
said. Mr. Malloy didn't return several phone calls seeking
comment.
