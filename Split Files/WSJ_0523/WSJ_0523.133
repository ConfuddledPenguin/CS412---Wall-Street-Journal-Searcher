   REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. -- Oracle Systems Corp. said it
created a separate U.S. operating subsidiary in an attempt to
address management problems that figured in its poorly
received fiscal-third-quarter earnings report.
   In addition, the developer of data base software said
Lawrence J. Ellison, president and chief executive officer,
would be assuming the additional post of chairman, succeeding
Donald L. Lucas, who continues as the company's executive
committee chairman.

   Oracle also named Gary D. Kennedy, senior vice president
and general manager of its U.S. operations, to the post of
president of the new subsidiary, Oracle USA.
   "The fact that we are reorganizing the U.S. operation into
a subsidiary is borne out of our determination to move the
financial-control organization closer to the distribution
organization. The way to do that is to give them everything
they need to operate as an independent subsidiary," said
Peter Tierney, senior vice president. "That is a significant
move on our part to again improve the control aspects in the
U.S. operation, which was an area where we had an issue
regarding third-quarter results."
   Oracle hit a flat spot in its five-year growth spurt
during its quarter ended Feb. 28, reporting nearly flat net
income of $24.3 million, or 18 cents a share, on a 54% rise
in revenue to $236.4 million. The lower-than-expected net
largely reflected roughly 5% less revenue than analysts
expected; the company itself conceded a glitch in completing
certain orders, which were picked up in the fourth quarter.
   The results nonetheless spooked investors, prompting
Oracle stock to drop about 30% in a day as well as a number
of shareholder suits claiming securities fraud. Yesterday's
reorganization was announced after markets closed.
   Mr. Tierney said naming Mr. Ellison to the chairmanship
reflects "just a maturation of the organization. Now, Larry
has a management team reporting to him that is in place and
he is confident that he can broaden his role in the company."
   Oracle also said Geoffrey W. Squire, formerly senior vice
president and Oracle Europe chief executive officer, was
named president of world-wide distribution operations as well
as a corporate executive vice president. Oracle said John R.
Luongo, formerly international-division senior vice
president, is resigning. Mr. Tierney said the company's
international operations have remained "very strong," and
said that Mr. Luongo's departure was "really a classic case
of an executive wanting to pursue another interest."
   Finally, Oracle said Joseph Costello, president and chief
executive officer of Cadence Design Systems Inc., was named a
director, filling a vacancy.
