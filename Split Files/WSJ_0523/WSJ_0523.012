   A sharp and unexpected drop in Federal Express Corp.'s
shipment growth in April sent the company's stock tumbling
almost 10% as investors lost patience with the struggling
air-express carrier.
   Though Federal Express has posted year-to-year earnings
declines in each of the past five quarters, industry analysts
-- encouraged by recent statements by the Memphis,
Tenn.-based company -- had expected a solid turnaround in the
fourth quarter ending May 31. Since December, investors have
bid up the price of the company's shares about 25%, to the
mid-$50 range, despite disappointing operating results.

   Late Monday, however, after the markets closed, Federal
Express disclosed more bad news that seemed to crush hopes
for an early turnaround: The company said shipment volume of
express packages and documents rose just 10.1% in April from
a year earlier, a steep dropoff from volume growth of 16% to
20% in previous quarters.
   Because of the low volume of shipments, a company
spokesman said, Federal Express is now "pessimistic" that it
can match or exceed year-ago net income of $41 million, or 78
cents a share.
   In heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Federal Express tumbled $5.125 to $47.
   "There's great conceptuals here -- there's great long-term
potential -- but there has to come a time when you start
seeing some results," said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley. Mr. Murphy was one of the industry analysts
who had been touting Federal Express's stock loudest before
yesterday, when he lowered his fourth-quarter earnings
estimate for the company about 34%, to 65 cents a share from
98 cents a share.
   "The script has changed," he said.
   The Federal Express spokesman attributed April's
lower-than-expected volume growth to a price increase April
1. Federal Express's average daily volume of express packages
and documents increased in April to 1.3 million from 1.2
million a year earlier.
   The spokesman also said Federal Express's heavyweight
cargo -- the business it entered upon acquiring Tiger
International Corp. last year -- dropped to an average daily
volume of 2.8 million pounds in April from 3.3 million pounds
a day in March. He cited weaker-than-expected exports from
Asia, particularly textiles and toys.
   Analysts said Federal Express's lackluster shipment growth
in the express-package market indicates that rival Airborne
Freight Corp. may be winning business away from the
much-larger Federal Express. Airborne has been targeting
large-volume express customers with lowball prices, according
to James Parker, an analyst with Robinson Humphrey Co. in
Atlanta, a strategy that has proven particularly successful
in the wake of Federal's price increases, he said. Airborne's
volume grew 35% in April, Mr. Parker estimates.
   "What really scares everyone is the possibility that
Federal's business will remain soft and Airborne's will
remain strong, prompting Federal to become very aggressive on
pricing and start another price war," said Mr. Parker. "A
price war could negate major earnings improvements" across
the industry for several more quarters.
   Mr. Parker slashed his projections of Federal Express's
fourth-quarter earnings to 62 cents a share from 92 cents a
share. He also revised his profit expectations for Federal
for fiscal 1991 to $3 a share from $4 a share.
   "This was the quarter when they were supposed to begin
putting it all together," said Paul Schlesinger, an analyst
with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., who cut
his fourth-quarter profit projections for Federal Express to
60 cents a share from 78 cents a share. "I'm not at all
confident that they can even make 60 cents a share," he said.
