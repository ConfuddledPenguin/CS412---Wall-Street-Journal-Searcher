   LOS ANGELES -- Federal Bureau of Investigation agents
raided two Northrop Corp. plants that perform work on the
F/A-18 strike fighter for the Navy, Marine Corps and several
foreign governments.
   Neither the FBI nor the U.S. attorney's office would
comment on the searches at the Hawthorne and El Segundo,
Calif., plants of the defense contractor's aircraft division.
A company spokesman, who said Northrop was "working with the
government to understand the issues" behind the raids, said
they began before 8 a.m. PDT and continued into the
afternoon. He declined to elaborate.

   Much of Northrop's activity at the two plants is as the
main subcontractor on St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas
Corp.'s F/A-18 Hornet, for which Northrop does 40% of the
work. Earlier this year, the Justice Department indicated it
would help litigate a whistle-blower's civil suit, alleging
overbilling by Northrop on the Hornet.
   But an attorney who has filed numerous cases against
Northrop on behalf of employee whistle-blowers said he
believes the searches were part of an investigation into "a
minimum of three weapons systems" that grew out of litigation
still under federal-court seal. The attorney, Herbert Hafif,
declined to identify the weapons systems, to identify his
client, or to detail the allegations in the suit, but he
claimed that the investigations have been under way for six
months and that "corroboration of substantial frauds is being
obtained."
   Among the other major work being done at the two Northrop
plants is development of a YF-23 prototype under the big Air
Force program to select an advanced tactical fighter.
   A person who is familiar with the raids disputed that
programs beyond the F/A-18 were involved, saying the raids
were concentrated in the areas of the two plants that
assemble center and aft fuselage sections of the Hornet for
shipment to McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis. He suggested that
the investigations could relate to a criminal case that
hasn't been reported by the government.
   McDonnell produces seven Hornets a month, and has produced
nearly 1,000 of the planes so far for the U.S., Canada,
Australia and Spain. Other customers for the plane, a total
of 1,636 of which have been ordered world-wide, are Kuwait,
Switzerland and South Korea.
   Northrop's problems with federal investigators in recent
years have extended into a large number of its major programs
beyond the F/A-18. Earlier this year, it settled a fraud case
involving company work on the Navy's AV-8B Harrier jet
fighter and the Air Force's air-launched cruise missile,
pleading guilty to making false statements and agreeing to
pay $17 million in fines. At that time, the government closed
criminal investigations into alleged improprieties relating
to Northrop work on MX missile guidance systems and its
largest program, the B-2 Stealth bomber.
   The FBI just last February had taken the unusual step of
raiding Northrop's B-2 plant in Pico Rivera, Calif., and
seizing documents, though that search apparently was part of
yet another investigation the government is conducting into
company B2 activities.
   Last year, Northrop also confirmed that federal agents had
subpoenaed documents from the Illinois-based division that
makes airborne radar-jamming equipment. Northrop was
investigated, too, as part of Operation Ill Wind, a major
inquiry into influence-peddling at the Pentagon. And a House
subcommittee and a federal grand jury are looking at $7.8
million in allegedly questionable payments made by Northrop
in connection with efforts to sell F-20 fighters, part of a
now-defunct program to South Korea.
