   Nawal Assus didn't accompany the theater group Tsaad/Hutwa
("One Step" in Hebrew and Arabic) on its North American debut
this spring. The Israeli Arab teacher bowed out a month after
rehearsals for the five-city tour began. An Armenian-American
actress was recruited to replace her.
   Ms. Assus's action wasn't due to illness or prior
commitments. Instead, she declined to participate out of a
belief that the theater, which addresses the daily
confrontations between Arabs and Jews in Israel, trivialized
the conflict. And she said she didn't feel comfortable
touring with one of the Israeli actors, who performs his
mandatory annual reserve duty in the Israeli Army in the Gaza
Strip.

   Her decision highlights the conflicts and contradictions
that accompany even genuine efforts to listen to one's enemy.
The cast members' anxieties are a microcosm of the broader
fears that have prevented Palestinians and Israelis from
sitting down with each other.
   Ironically, the group's message about the importance of
communication between Arabs and Israeli Jews has so far been
heard primarily by American Jewish audiences. The group has
given two performances in Israel, both times in English and
in preparation for the tour.
   The crowd that filled the majestic Congregation Rodeph
Sholom on Manhattan's Upper West Side clearly was moved by
the performance. And the camaraderie demonstrated by the cast
members as they bantered before the show is evidence of the
viability of the very idea they are promoting. "We are the
living proof of what this theater is all about," says Sa'ed
Nashef, the 21-year-old co-founder of Tsaad/Hutwa.
   Nonetheless, as the case of Ms. Assus demonstrates,
politics keeps getting in the way. The group grew out of a
meeting of an unlikely pair: Mr. Nashef, an Israeli Arab from
East Jerusalem, and Joyce Klein, a 40-year-old American
Jewish educator living in Israel at the time. They were
convinced that theater could be a bridge between the two
sides.
   It was an inauspicious moment for such an idea. They
scheduled the first meeting for January 1988. A few weeks
before, the intifada, or uprising, erupted. Israeli soldiers
and Arab protesters clashed daily. One Israeli Jew who showed
up for the meeting questioned why a Palestinian Arab would
even bother joining a theater group while the intifada was
raging. People willing to take one step were considered
completely out of step.
   Despite this, the group held together, eventually giving a
performance at an educational conference in Jerusalem that
summer. A director from the New Israel Fund, a non-profit
organization that supports Israeli groups promoting social
change, saw the show and offered to sponsor a North American
tour.
   It took another year to get the project off the ground. By
then, most of the original members had quit. They were
replaced by professional actors. Ms. Klein wrote a script but
threw it out once rehearsals began: "Nothing I could write
came near the intensity of their own stories."
   The decision to perform a play based on the actors'
personal experiences gave the group a special intensity.
Theater became a kind of therapy. Eran Bohem, an Israeli
actor living in Tel Aviv, shared a recurring nightmare that
terrorists attack his family. Nabil Izhiman, a Palestinian
Arab student, confessed he wasn't sure he would ever be able
to trust a Jew.
   These feelings found their way into the play, called
"Another Face." But the group was careful not to offer
political solutions, fearing that would destroy its fragile
coalition. "When we talk about our feelings politics hangs
over us," concedes Moti Levi, one of the Israeli Jewish
actors. "But we don't let it interfere because it cuts
communication between us."
   But one of the skits illustrates the limits of the group's
delicate balancing act. In it, a soldier doing reserve duty
in the Gaza Strip sees a Palestinian friend in the crowd of
protesters he has been ordered to disperse. The idea behind
the skit was to strip away politically charged symbols like a
soldier or a demonstrator and reveal the humanity of both
people. "We all have set reactions to soldiers shooting guns
and people throwing rocks," Ms. Klein says. "But we wanted to
show what happens to those people who come together. How do
they talk to each other?"
   Awkwardly it seems, if this skit is any indication. The
soldier inquires after his Palestinian friend's family while
frisking him, in order to protect him from being viewed as a
collaborator. Even friendship can't divorce itself entirely
from the realities of the political situation.
   That remains true offstage as well. Mr. Nashef's brother
was concerned that his participation might lead to reprisals
against the family in Jerusalem and asked him not to put the
family name in the program. Some of Israeli actress Dafna
Karta-Schwartz's friends called her a traitor for joining the
group.
   For many of the cast, however, Tsaad/Hutwa has become a
sort of refuge from politics. "I'm tired of demonstrations
and petitions. They haven't changed the antagonism," says Mr.
Bohem. For Mr. Izhiman, who studies law at Hebrew University,
the decision has a pragmatic dimension as well. "It's hard to
stay clear of politics because the issues affect me. But I
don't want to jeopardize my chances of finding a job in the
future," he says.
   Despite these external pressures, the members say their
attention to the personal has shown results impossible to be
achieved at political rallies. "Once at rehearsal, Nabil said
he hadn't realized Eran is scared of terrorists," Mr. Levi
says. "For me, this is why we're working, so Nabil can
understand we're afraid of him too, that we're human."
   The group plans to perform the play in Hebrew and in
Arabic at high schools in Israel, "so the audience is young
enough that we can really make a difference," Ms. Klein says.
And despite their misgivings, they may even end up
contributing to changes in the political landscape as well.
"In a way, the group has prepared me to talk politics," says
Mr. Nashef. "Now that I can get through to someone, I can
take the next step. I'm ready to reach out to someone on the
other side."
