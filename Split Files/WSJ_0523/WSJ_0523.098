   In this graduation season, many high-school administrators
will be deciding whether to include prayer in their
ceremonies. The issue is more and more a subject of debate.
The new discussion reflects a growing pattern of hostility to
religion in the U.S.
   In short, many understand the law today as being hostile
rather than neutral toward religion -- as forbidding all
public prayers rather than simply prohibiting state-authored
and state-required prayers in public schools.

   When the Supreme Court decided the original school prayer
case in 1962 (Engel v. Vitale), I interpreted the decision to
forbid only state-authored and state-required prayers. As
such, I thought the case was correctly decided. What I did
not foresee, but what was sensed by people whose vision was
far greater than my own, was that this decision would set in
motion a chain of legal and public and educational actions
that would bring us to the current circumstances in which we
must reaffirm and even contend for religious liberty.
   Such a situation exists in the U.S. today. In Utah, for
example, controversies have arisen over prayers offered in
high-school graduation exercises. A suit filed on behalf of
two students in one school district last year objected that
prayers being offered were "denominational," since they
mentioned the name of Jesus Christ. The suit asked that such
prayers be "non-denominational."
   Interpreting this as a plea for a court order requiring
that the name of Jesus Christ not be used in prayers offered
at a public high-school graduation exercise, I thought of the
first school prayer decision. In that case, the Supreme Court
said government had no power to write prayers. Before
Americans acquiesce to the use of judicial power to indicate
what words cannot be included in a prayer, they should
remember that if it is not part of the business of government
to write a prayer, then it is not part of the business of a
court to censor a prayer.
   The Supreme Court voiced that principle just six years ago
in rejecting an argument that the prayers in a state
legislative assembly were illegal because they were always
offered by a chaplain of one religious denomination. The
court said: "The content of the prayer is not of concern to
judges where, as here, there is no indication that the prayer
opportunity has been exploited to proselytize."
   Under this reasoning, the attempt in Utah to have a court
dictate what could not be included in a prayer would not
succeed. But even a winning case can be expensive to defend,
and in the graduation-exercise case, this economic pressure
persuaded the school board to do away with prayers as part of
their graduation exercises.
   Following the 1962 Supreme Court decision on prayer in
schools, eminent legal scholars ridiculed the idea that the
court's school prayer decisions would lead to a great gulf
between religion and public life. What the legal scholars did
not foresee is the extent to which the school-prayer and
Bible-reading decisions would shift the burden of proof with
respect to religious practices in public life. In the past,
religion had been an accepted part of public life in America.
It has become something that had to prove its right to remain
in the public square. By the 1970s earlier principles had
hardened into mechanical formulas that can be interpreted in
ways hostile to religion.
   Many citizens and some educators have come to consider it
bad taste or even illegal for public-school teachers to
mention religious influences or commitments. No wonder
Americans suffer appalling ignorance of their political and
cultural origins.
   Studies show that textbook authors have avoided references
to God or to religion. For example, one textbook in use today
defines "pilgrims," originally a religious term, as "people
who make long trips." In another text, no religious event is
included in a list of hundreds of important events over a
200-year period in American history, and the religious
origins of pre-Civil War abolitionism and the recent Civil
Rights movement are commonly skimmed over or totally omitted.
   Initially, the Supreme Court's school prayer decision
outlawed only state-authored and state-required prayers.
Later, the courts forbade any prayers in public -- school
classrooms -- even prayers that were privately composed or
optional. The courts were concerned with the possibility that
impressionable young students would be coerced by such
publicly sponsored religious exercises. Despite the absence
of coercion from prayers in adult settings, and despite the
fact that prayers are frequently offered in legislative and
other public meetings in every state in the union, some have
continued their efforts to force the abolition of prayers at
government or other public meetings. Immense resources have
been devoted to thrashing out the constitutional limits on
prayer.
   Appellate court opinions issued in the past several years
have split on the legality of prayers at high-school
graduation exercises. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet
ruled on any such controversy. I hope the court will reaffirm
a 1952 opinion: "When the state encourages religious
instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by
adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs,
it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects
the religious nature of our people and accommodates the
public service to their spiritual needs."
   As the law stands today, school boards challenged on the
legality of prayers offered on public ceremonial occasions
must choose among continuing such prayers and risking
expensive litigation, abandoning prayer and being seen as
relinquishing treasured practices, or substituting a moment
of silence in which all are invited to offer private
devotions.
   The last option is likely to be unacceptable to most. In
my view, the one alternative that is entirely unacceptable is
for a school district to attempt to prescribe or censor
prayers to be offered at any function in the district.
   Religion should have a place in the public life of our
nation. To honor this principle with prayers in the
graduation exercises of high-school students is to honor the
religious plurality of our nation and the religious liberty
it was founded to protect.
