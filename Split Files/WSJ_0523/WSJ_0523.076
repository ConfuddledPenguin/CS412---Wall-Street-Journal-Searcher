   NEW YORK -- Exxon Corp. and Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. unit
said they settled out of court allegations by a Bermuda-based
oil-trading company that they and six other oil companies
rigged the price of crude oil.
   Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. But Transnor
(Bermuda) Ltd. received far less than the $261 million for
which it had sued initially. A federal judge recently limited
Transnor's damage claims to less than $42 million, according
to an attorney for the trading company.

   But the settlement does nothing to dissipate the cloud
that has been hanging over the crude oil market because of an
opinion issued last month by U.S. District Court Judge
William C. Conner. Judge Conner ruled that forward trading in
Brent, a widely traded North Sea crude that helps set the
price of other crudes, should be regulated in the same way as
a U.S. futures contract. A forward market is one in which two
parties agree to the purchase and sale of a commodity at some
future time under such conditions as the parties agree. In
this case, the commodity was oil.
   The two oil companies were the last defendants remaining
in a lawsuit brought by Transnor, a small oil trading firm
operated by former Amoco Corp. traders John Corp and Roy
Moor. The firm also was engaged in buying Iraqi crude and
supplying oil to the African country of Kenya, according to
the Transnor attorney.
   Transnor's suit alleged that the companies rigged prices
in the Brent 15-day forward market four years ago. Several
other oil companies, initially accused with Exxon and Conoco,
had already settled with Transnor. They were all affiliates
of either British Petroleum Co. or Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
   Under the settlement, neither Exxon nor Conoco accepted
any liability for the decline of oil prices in 1986, as
alleged in the suit. That year, prices crashed to less than
$9 a barrel for some crudes from more than $30 a barrel.
Exxon said that though it traded in accordance with all laws
and regulations, it sought an "out-of-court settlement
because it was the best way to resolve the issue with least
disruption to the Brent forward market."
   Judge Conner issued his opinion about Brent forward
trading in an order denying Exxon's and Conoco's motion that
the antitrust case be dropped. The judge's opinion stunned
non-U.S. participants in the Brent forward market to such an
extent many of them have quit or severely curtailed trading
with U.S. firms.
   And U.S. participants in the Brent market fear they could
be held in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, which
requires all futures contracts entered into by U.S. players
be traded on regulated futures exchanges. Transactions on the
Brent market are carried out by telephone and telex.
   Exxon said its U.S. operations won't resume trading in the
Brent forward market until the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission issues a final ruling, possibly within a month, on
whether the Brent market should be considered a futures
market. Exxon said, however, that it may resume trading
through some of its foreign affiliates.
   Judge Conner's April 18 ruling dropped trading volume in
the Brent market by between 25% and 30%, according to one
market participant. Andrew Hall, president of Phibro Energy
Inc., a division of Salomon Inc., said: "Major European
players have stopped dealing with our U.S. division."
   The ensuing panic and calls for clarification from the
oil-trading industry prompted the CFTC to issue a statement
on May 16 saying that it believed Brent market transactions
to be exempt under an exclusion clause in the Commodity
Exchange Act.
   The letter released by the CFTC hints that the full
commission soon will issue a "statutory interpretation" of
the act as it applies to Brent contracts. Some observers
believe that in the absence of such an interpretation the
market would remain under a cloud.
   In his opinion, Judge Conner noted that Brent contracts
were highly standardized and that the volume of contracts
traded was many times the amount of oil available to satisfy
such contracts. He concluded that the Brent market ". . . .
has enabled participants to develop what is essentially a
`paper' market for speculative or hedging purposes."
   But Phibro Energy's Mr. Hall said: "The Brent market is
one that deals in physical oil and it should not be regulated
like those where doctors and dentists are speculating on the
future price of a commodity."
