   SYDNEY, Australia -- Entrepreneur Alan Bond, struggling to
save his deeply indebted brewing, media, property and
natural-resources empire, reached an out-of-court settlement
with bank lenders.
   His Bond Corp. Holdings still faces legal battles with a
group of U.S. debenture holders, a threat Mr. Bond is trying
to head off by offering to buy the debt back at a deep
discount.

   And despite massive asset sales to reduce debt, a senior
Bond Corp. official said the group still owes 5.3 billion
Australian dollars (US$4.05 billion), including bonds
convertible into shares of Bond Corp. or its units, Bell
Group Ltd. and Bell Resources Ltd. That compares with A$7.35
billion in debt it said it had at the end of 1989.
   Under the accord, a group of international banks led by
National Australia Bank Ltd. agreed to drop a lawsuit it
launched against Bond Corp.'s unit, Bond Brewing Holdings
Ltd., for early repayment of loans. The bank group had agreed
to provide Bond Brewing, which is Bond Corp.'s main
Australian brewing company, with A$880 million in credit
lines.
   Besides National Australia Bank, the bank syndicate
includes Standard Chartered PLC of Britain; First National
Bank of Boston and Pittsburgh National Bank of the U.S.;
Societe Generale of France; Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp.
of Japan; and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
   In December, the banks persuaded a court to appoint
receivers to Bond Brewing, claiming that the brewing unit had
breached covenants of the loan accord. Bond Corp. disputed
the banks' claims, and the receivership order was overturned
on appeal in February. Meanwhile, the banks pursued a
separate court action to force Bond Brewing to immediately
repay the loan; that action has been dropped.
   In return, Bond Corp. Tuesday dropped a suit against the
banks for damages. Bond Corp. also acquiesced to a number of
conditions imposed by the bank group. Among them is a
stipulation that Bond Brewing appoint two partners of
international accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords
to oversee the unit's activities and report back to the bank
syndicate.
   Under Tuesday's accord, the banks also agreed to approve a
proposed sale of Bond Corp.'s Australian breweries to its
58%-controlled unit Bell Resources for A$1.85 billion. If the
sale is concluded by July 31, the banks will give Bond
Brewing until July 31, 1991, to repay the A$880 million
credit facility. In return, Bond Corp. agreed to immediately
restrict its voting rights in Bell Resources to the
equivalent of 25% of the shares on issue and promised to
reduce its actual stake to 25% from the current 58% by March
31, 1991.
   Peter Lucas, a Bond Corp. director and chief spokesman,
said the company hasn't yet lined up a buyer for the 33% of
Bell Resources it has agreed to sell. New Zealand brewer Lion
Nathan Ltd., which at one time was negotiating to buy part of
Bond Corp.'s Australian breweries, signaled Tuesday that it
is interested in buying a stake in the breweries as a
joint-venture partner. The Australian breweries held through
the Bond Brewing unit together constitute the second-biggest
beer-maker in Australia.
   But if Bond Corp.'s brewery sale to Bell Resources isn't
completed in two months, terms of Tuesday's settlement call
for Bond Brewing to repay the banks in full by Sept. 30.
   As part of the bank settlement, Bell Resources and
National Australia Bank agreed to provide Bond Brewing with
unspecified loans to finance an offer to buy back US$510
million in debentures issued in the U.S. by Bond Brewing.
U.S. Trust Co., trustee for the U.S. investors, has demanded
immediate repayment in full plus interest, which a lawyer for
the U.S. investor group estimates will total US$100 million
by June.
   The U.S. group is suing to liquidate Bond Brewing in court
action scheduled to begin next Wednesday in Melbourne. To
head that off, Bond Corp. said its Bond Brewing unit plans to
offer to buy back the debentures "at prices approximating the
current prevailing market prices," which Mr. Lucas said total
about 40 U.S. cents for every US$1 in face value.
