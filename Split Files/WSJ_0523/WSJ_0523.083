   Your April 13 Law column item "Arbitration Settles a Lot,
Unsettles a Few" doesn't reflect accurately the
cost-effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution.
   Arbitration does not favor the well-to-do. On the
contrary, it is a far less expensive means of settling a
dispute than going through the regular court system. A case
that goes to court can cost consumers an average of $500 a
day in legal fees, regardless of whether the case is heard
that day. This can add up to thousands of dollars before the
case is settled.

   However, the largest dispute-resolution firms charge a
nominal fee of $100 an hour -- an average of $400 a case.
Consumers also receive fast results. Most cases are settled
within 51 days.
