   Just as the Bush administration looks likely to negotiate
new taxes with Congress, Lawrence B. Lindsey has published an
authoritative argument for the tax cuts of the Reagan years.
   But "The Growth Experiment: How the New Tax Policy Is
Transforming the U.S. Economy" (Basic Books, 260 pages,
$21.95) isn't just about recent history, it also advances the
tax-cutting thesis, making a persuasive case for a further
overhaul of the tax system, and even proposing a standard
flat tax rate of 19% coupled with an end to most deductions.

   Arguing for "a tax system that puts people before
political pandering," the author reminds us that the proper
purpose of the income tax is to raise revenue in the most
painless way to the people, economy and nation.
   Mr. Lindsey, a Harvard economics professor who worked in
the Reagan White House as a senior tax-policy economist, is
understandably partial to the achievements of that
administration. But he also is one of the most cogent and
knowledgeable of the supply-side advocates and, in this book,
he provides us with what is likely to stand as the most
credible and coherent supply-side account of the revolution
in U.S. tax policy that triumphed in the 1980s.
   During that decade, tax-cutting became widely accepted and
practiced. Britain, Norway, Australia, Canada, Austria,
Belgium, South Korea, West Germany and even Japan, cut back
tax rates. With hindsight it is easy to forget the outrage
that the supply siders caused. As Mr. Lindsey says, they
posed one of the greatest challenges to reigning economic
dogma since Keynes's overthrow of classical economics in the
1930s.
   Primarily microeconomists, the supply siders concentrated
on the neglected area of income tax and how it affects
incentives for individuals to work, save and invest. Income
tax, which "The Growth Experiment" terms "the political
Achilles' heel of Keynesian orthodoxy," already was buckling
under the strain of overuse and abuse. In their preoccupation
with macroeconomics and demand management policies, the
Keynesians had all but forgotten about tax policy and its
effects on the individual. Redressing this balance was the
supply siders' greatest victory.
   The Keynesians were ripe for the picking. They were
bewildered by stagflation, that uncomfortable combination of
rising unemployment and inflation that characterized the late
1970s. They also were too willing to see tax cuts just as a
way to expand demand.
   A former pupil of Martin Feldstein, president of the
National Bureau of Economic Research, Mr. Lindsey doesn't try
to give the whole show to the supply siders. He concedes that
some of their more extreme hypotheses have proved false, such
as that all of the Reagan tax cuts were self-financing.
   Mr. Lindsey carefully estimates that as much as two-thirds
of the cuts were self-financing. But he sometimes seems too
eager to credit the supply-side revolution. When more married
women went out to work in the mid-1980s, he credits the
supply-side effects of the tax cuts. To be sure, they played
an important part. But social and demographic trends show
increasing numbers of married women began going out to work
in the 1970s, and as Mr. Lindsey acknowledges, married
working women still face the most punitive tax rates.
   The book also skates over some of the bolder claims of the
supply-siders, many of whom maintained that the tax cuts
would be entirely self-financing. That
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too approach encouraged fiscal
irresponsibility and deepened the federal deficit problem.
   Mr. Lindsey also is quick to blame profligate politicians
for the deficits that at least in some part resulted from tax
cuts. The politicians were indeed profligate, both on Capitol
Hill and in the White House. Defense spending increased
substantially, helping the federal deficit to balloon;
middle-class transfers grew too, and political stalemate and
inertia mean that the country has yet to find solutions to
large federal deficits.
   "The Growth Experiment's" concentration on federal income
tax also is somewhat one-sided. State and local taxes are
scarcely mentioned. They have generally risen in recent years
-- particularly in poorly run big cities where so many
Americans live -- offsetting some of the effect of the
federal cuts.
   But Mr. Lindsey makes an almost unassailable case for
keeping top income tax rates below 50%, and also provides
compelling evidence that the Reagan tax cuts helped boost
economic growth. The supply siders clearly recognize that if
you tax people too much, they'll just take their money
elsewhere.
   Politicians henceforth will ignore tax policy at their
peril. Bracket creep and high inflation raise tax rates
brutally. In response, citizens will pursue an increasingly
feverish search for shelters, fringe benefits -- anything to
cut the tax take. Revenues for government fall.
   The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, the basis of "The
Growth Experiment," also wasn't the gift to the rich that
some would have us believe. By eliminating bracket creep, it
delivered substantial benefits to ordinary working people.
   While he is an advocate of that act, Mr. Lindsey also is
prepared to be the intelligent critic, too. The nation's
savings performance was poor during these years and the act
was lopsided, in that it boosted investment much more
powerfully than it encouraged savings. To raise savings, Mr.
Lindsey proposes Individual Savings Accounts that would offer
similar advantages to IRAs with the additional enticement of
a more liberal withdrawal policy.
   The debt bias of the tax system also must be changed. The
tax system punishes savings, is overly harsh in its treatment
of capital gains and rewards borrowing. Subsidized borrowing
also severely distorts the housing market.
   Doing away with such distortions would allow much lower
tax rates, and a flat rate of as low as 11% would provide
enough money to finance today's federal government. Mr.
Lindsey compromises here and proposes a flat rate of 19% to
pay for the few allowances he would retain.
   Politicians, though, hate flat rates, which blunt their
ability to direct people's behavior. But a lower flat rate is
likely to appeal to most citizens who now pay a federal tax
rate of 28%, social security at 7.5%, and state taxes of
about 5%. As Mr. Lindsey says, "for most of history a 40% tax
rate on the middle class would have seemed an unconscionable
tyranny."
