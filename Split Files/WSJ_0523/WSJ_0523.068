   Courage, My Friend

<TEXT>
   Within this world you never made
   It's important not to be afraid,
   For as sure as you are reading here,
   Prescisely the very thing you fear,
   Whatever the tune, will lead the parade.
   -- Ruth Boorstin.

   Counterpunch
                                                                                                       

   At this point in time
   I've run into some flak:
   Having hit middle age,
   It's begun to hit back.

   Paper Chase
                                                                                                       

   I love to read magazines,
   But I find it very hard
   To concentrate while I am
   Ripping out another card.
   -- Herm Albright.
