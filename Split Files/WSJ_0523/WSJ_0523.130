   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said its
bank insurance fund had a loss of $851 million in 1989,
bringing the fund's total to $13.2 billion at year end.
   The loss, which was in line with recent FDIC estimates,
put the fund's total at 0.7% of insured deposits at the
nation's banks. At the end of 1988, the fund totaled $14.1
billion, or 0.8% of insured deposits.

   William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, said the new level
was the lowest in the recent history of the FDIC, which was
started during the Depression. Government policy is to try to
maintain the fund at about 1.25% of insured deposits. Under
the savings-and-loan bailout law, the premiums paid by banks
will rise this year with the goal of increasing the fund.
   Mr. Seidman reiterated that the bank fund could increase
this year because bank failures have slowed. However, he
warned that the failure of a big bank could cause a loss.
