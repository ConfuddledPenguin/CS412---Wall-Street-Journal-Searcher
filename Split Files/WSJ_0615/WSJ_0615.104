   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration, in an
effort to reduce the threat of terrorist air attacks,
disclosed plans to order the installation of more-sensitive
airport X-ray machines and metal detectors.
   The agency also is planning to order airlines to make sure
that all bags on flights leaving the U.S. are accompanied by
a passenger. Unaccounted-for bags would be subjected to
additional searches, which may cause occasional added delays.
In addition, the agency is still studying several major
recommendations made by a presidential commission last month.

   Meanwhile, the Transportation Department announced the
creation of the Office of Intelligence and Security. The
office's new director, as part of the transportation
secretary's staff, will oversee the development of aviation
and maritime security policy.
   The department's action was a response to the President's
Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, which
investigated the terrorist downing of Pan American World
Airways Flight 103 in December 1988. In its report last
month, the panel found that the FAA was a "reactive agency"
with inadequate planning for security threats and that the
civil-aviation security needed substantial improvements. Some
of the steps announced by the FAA yesterday were in the works
before the commission report.
   Two congressional members of the seven-member commission,
Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R.,
N.Y.), praised the security changes as good first steps, but
insisted that more improvements were needed. They both
emphasized the commission recommendation that the FAA assign
"federal security managers" to high-risk airports in the U.S.
and abroad. "It certainly should be done," said Sen. D'Amato,
who said Congress would order it if the FAA doesn't act.
   An FAA official, who declined to be named, said the agency
is considering the recommendation "very seriously." He said
the agency also is taking a close look at other commission
recommendations, which ranged from better background checks
for security employees to tighter procedures for air mail and
cargo.
   The FAA official said the agency will issue a proposal
that would essentially require airlines to replace X-ray
equipment made before 1985 with newer equipment that is more
sensitive. The final order would come out by year end. He
said the new X-ray units would cost $25,000 to $40,000 each,
but didn't know how many units would have to be replaced. The
requirement for better metal detectors, which will also be
able to detect plastic weapons, will be made final in the
next few months.
   The presidential commission on Lockerbie had urged the
Transportation Department to appoint an assistant secretary
to handle security. But that would have required
congressional approval because all the department's allotted
jobs at that level are filled, department officials said.
Naming a director of security got around that problem.
Secretary Samuel Skinner appointed Coast Guard Vice Adm.
Clyde Robbins as the first director of the office.
