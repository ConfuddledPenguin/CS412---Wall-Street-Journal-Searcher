   NEW YORK -- A graph of Henley Group's stock during the
past year is not a pretty sight.
   The picture is that of a curve descending from $60
(adjusted for a spinoff) in the second quarter of 1989 to $45
at the start of 1990. Yesterday, in trading on the national
over-the-counter market, the shares closed at $31.25, off 25
cents.

   What's tanking is not only Henley Group's stock, but also
an approach toward investing that was much in favor in the
1980s.
   Henley and its chairman, Michael Dingman, exemplified Wall
Street's faith in a kind of financial alchemy. It was widely
believed that groups of assets could, when adroitly
reshuffled, re-emerge as significantly more valuable. All it
took, the credo held, was an alchemist -- a Mike Dingman --
to bring the value out.
   "Maybe it's the story of the '90s," says a Wall Street
fund manager. "If all you bring to the table is asset
shuffling, maybe you don't bring anything to the table
anymore."
   Henley, based in Hampton, N.H., was created out of the
scrap heap of Allied-Signal. Rather than holding a fire sale
of 35 unwanted businesses, Allied-Signal spun them off in
1986 into a new entity known as Henley Group, to be run by
Mr. Dingman.
   Wall Street hailed this as a stroke of genius, not quite
on a par with the discovery of penicillin but nonetheless
worthy of a then-record initial public offering netting $1.2
billion.
   Henley's assets were known as "Dingman's dogs," but this
was a term of affection. Via restructurings, spinoffs and
sales, Mr. Dingman was widely expected to spin gold from
straw.
   Henley was burdened with too much in goodwill write-offs
to show any earnings; it was an asset play from the start.
And Henley's 10-K annual report was clear as to its purpose.
It didn't "anticipate building an integrated enterprise."
Rather, it would seek to "reposition its operating entitites
{to} add value to the whole."
   Spinoffs followed in rapid order; four have been executed
so far. Last year, Henley noted in its spring 1989 annual
report that an investor who bought stock at the initial
offering price and retained the spunoff shares would have had
a pretax gain of 38%.
   Alas, this year's annual report doesn't update the
calculation. But Henley says that, as of yesterday, the
original stake had grown by 18% -- a paltry pretax gain over
four years.
   Henley's major assets include 37% of Itel stock; 7% of
Wheelabrator Technologies; a big (but barely breakeven)
Chilean methanol plant; Pneumo Abex, a heavily indebted
aerospace, industrial and defense supplier, and Fisher
International, which distributes and makes scientific and
diagnostic instruments.
   The company's tangible book value is only $19.85 a share.
It doesn't have any earnings. Free cash flow, after deducting
ongoing capital expenditure and interest expense last year,
was a negative $25 million, more or less, a Henley official
says.
   Mr. Dingman has surely been active in the past four years,
but to what end? He pursued Santa Fe Pacific but didn't get
it. He spun off part of Fisher and then bought it back again.
   With Wasserstein Perella as a partner, Henley bought
Pneumo Abex in a $1.2 billion leveraged buy-out, betting that
it could be quickly turned around, carved up and sold. That
idea failed. The next year the investment banking firm sold
its stake to Henley at a 200% profit.
   Analysts say Pneumo Abex was overpriced from the start.
"Whenever you play the greater fool theory, someone gets left
holding the bag," says First Boston analyst R. Jackson
Blackstock. In this case, the someone was Henley Group.
   The liquidation, and the shuffling, is still in progress.
Henley now plans to spin off 100% of Fisher and 35% of Pneumo
Abex.
   Alan Snyder, a San Francisco money manager and Henley
stockholder, says "the value is still there" -- meaning much
higher than where the stock is today.
   Mr. Dingman says, "I think the overall concept {of Henley}
was good. For investors to be content, they have to stick
with you" for the entire process. Asked whether, in the case
of Fisher, there has been too much shuffling, Mr. Dingman
allows: "In hindsight, I wished it hadn't happened the way it
did." As for Pneumo Abex, he says: "The idea that you can buy
something you have never managed and assume you are going to
liquidate is a lousy presumption." But Mr. Dingman says both
units should grow smartly. And he predicts that Henley's own
liquidation is on track for the end of 1991, and that holders
will reap "a damn sight higher" price than the current level.
   Analysts are neutral to mildly bullish; several say the
stock has become cheap. In general, the sentiment is that Mr.
Dingman should be able to wring out some surplus value.
   But Eli Lustgarten, of PaineWebber, has dared in a recent
report to say what no one in the 1980s imagined. "The current
stock price (then 36 1/4) "may fairly reflect break-up
value," he wrote. In other words: reshuffling a deck doesn't
necessarily revalue it.
