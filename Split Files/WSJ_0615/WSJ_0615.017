   PARIS -- The state-owned French steel producer Usinor
Sacilor S.A. said it is launching a bid for 20% of the shares
outstanding of the steel trading company ASD PLC, a 77%-owned
unit of Stemcor PLC, in cooperation with the British concern.
   The French company plans a joint venture with ASD that
will set up a steel-plate trading center outside London.
Usinor will own 49% of the venture, and ASD 51%. The project
is subject to approval by European Community authorities in
Brussels.

   Usinor said the joint concern will boost ASD's steel
trading revenue, which was #205 million ($350.9 million) in
1989. ASD markets about 500,000 metric tons of steel a year
from 20 offices throughout Britain, making it the
second-largest British steel trading concern. A metric ton is
equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
