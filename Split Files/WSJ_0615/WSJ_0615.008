   A federal judge in Santa Fe, N.M., ruled that the
Resolution Trust Corp. can override state banking laws to
facilitate the sale of failed thrifts to banks.
   New Mexico and 12 other states impose varying restrictions
on banks' ability to operate branches, presenting statutory
roadblocks to the RTC's efforts to sell failed thrifts and
their branches.

   The RTC contends that it has the power, under the
legislation that created the agency last year, to ignore some
state laws in its quest to sell failed savings and loan
associations in the quickest and most cost-effective way
possible. To strengthen its argument, the RTC on June 1
adopted a policy explicitly stating that it can override
state laws.
   Shortly after the policy took effect, trade associations
representing independent and community banks in New Mexico
filed suit, asking federal Judge Santiago Campos to rule that
the policy violates states' rights to establish and enforce
their own laws.
   The trade associations argued that banks buying failed
thrifts and their branches would have an unfair advantage
over banks that don't acquire thrifts and thus must follow
state law restricting branches to their home counties.
   After a hearing in Santa Fe, Judge Campos rejected the
bank organizations' arguments and dismissed their suit. A
final order stating his reasons for the ruling is expected to
be issued today.
   The possible impact of Judge Campos's ruling on other
state laws couldn't immediately be determined. But a federal
judge in Colorado, where bank-branch limitations are among
the strictest in the country, has also been asked to rule on
the legality of the RTC's override policy.
   Barbara Walker, first assistant attorney general in
Colorado, said she filed a request Monday for judicial review
of the policy on behalf of the state banking commissioner. No
court date has been set.
