   FRANKFURT -- The mug shots of Susanne Albrecht and Inge
Viett have hung on the walls of West German post offices for
more than a decade.
   Now, the elusive terrorist suspects are sitting in East
German jails awaiting extradition to West Germany for trial.
Their story adds a footnote to the Cold War annals of a
divided Germany.

   Millions of West German marks and untold hours were spent
trying to find the two women, among the 20 or so members of
the Red Army Faction terror group who have been at the top of
West Germany's most-wanted lists since the 1970s.
   West German police last arrested a top RAF member in 1982;
the other suspects vanished. But the killing of public
officials and industry leaders kept up through the 1980s. The
most recent was the murder in November of Deutsche Bank AG
Chairman Alfred Herrhausen, whose car was blown up by a
roadside bomb.
   Police were embarrassed for years by their inability to
track down prime suspects. Now they have some reason to know
why: At least some disappeared into East Germany with the
cooperation of the East German Ministry for State Security,
or Stasi. East German authorities now say they suspect Stasi
granted haven -- and possibly new identities -- to fugitive
West German terrorists.
   The disclosures triggered outrage in Bonn. West Germany's
opposition Social Democratic Party spoke bitterly of
"veritable terror nests" in East Germany and demanded a
parliamentary investigation.
   Many West German authorities aren't particularly
surprised. "We relayed our first indications that RAF members
could be living in East Germany to East Berlin in 1986, but
didn't get any response," said Hartmut Jaufmann, spokesman
for West Germany's Federal Criminal Office. "Since the
changes of last year, they've become much more cooperative."
   With German unification looming, East German authorities
are throwing out the dragnet. East German Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel sharply criticized the old Communist
regime and pledged his full support in rooting out any
terrorists hiding in East Germany.
   "I also will clear up as much as possible this diabolical
connection between the Ministry for State Security and the
terror scene," Mr. Diestel declared during a visit to Bonn
this week.
   Speaking yesterday at a news conference in East Berlin,
Mr. Diestel said East Germany's top Communist leaders knew of
the Stasi program for fugitive terrorists. He said
questioning of Ms. Albrecht disclosed that RAF ringleaders in
1980 urged her to flee because she had become a security
risk. He said that on arriving in East Germany, Ms. Albrecht
said she was told that East Germany disapproves of the RAF's
methods, but supports the gang's "anti-imperialist
orientation."
   Ms. Albrecht's shadowy existence ended June 6, when East
German police, working with West German counterterror
officials, arrested the 39-year-old in her East Berlin
apartment, where she lived under a new name.
   Ms. Albrecht, the daughter of a prosperous Hamburg
attorney, is suspected of complicity in the 1977 murder of
Dresdner Bank AG Chairman Hans-Juergen Ponto, who was a close
friend of the Albrecht family. The banker reportedly admitted
Ms. Albrecht and her accomplices into his home after
recognizing Ms. Albrecht. He was shot five times, apparently
by one of Ms. Albrecht's associates.
   After assuming her new East German identity in 1980, she
apparently broke ties with the RAF, married an East German
and gave birth to a daughter. Authorities say she was
identified in her solid middle-class hideaway after screening
East German immigration records. But there also is
speculation that Ms. Albrecht was identified by a former
Stasi official.
   The second coup came Tuesday night, when East German
police arrested Ms. Viett in her apartment in the city of
Magdeburg after being tipped off by a neighbor. The
46-year-old former kindergarten teacher was on the
most-wanted list for a series of terror attacks, including
the 1974 murder of a West Berlin judge and the 1981 shooting
of a French policeman while escaping arrest in Paris.
   Both Ms. Albrecht and Ms. Viett are believed to have
broken years ago with the RAF's bloody campaign against what
they call the military-industrial complex. Mr. Diestel said
that Ms. Albrecht kept in touch with the Stasi until the
collapse of the Communist regime late last year.
   Other leads on terrorists are beginning to surface. A
Dresden newspaper reported that another RAF suspect, Silke
Maier-Witt, had lived in that East German city. Ms.
Maier-Witt is wanted in connection with the 1977 kidnapping
and murder of Hanns Martin Schleyer, a West German industry
leader. There also are reports that Sigrid Sternebeck, sought
in connection with an attempted bazooka attack on the West
German Attorney General's Office in 1977, could be in East
Germany.
