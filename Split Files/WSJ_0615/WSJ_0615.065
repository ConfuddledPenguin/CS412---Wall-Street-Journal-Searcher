   OTTAWA -- A Manitoba Indian leader, Elijah Harper, is
threatening to block Manitoba ratification of a plan to
settle Canada's constitutional impasse.
   The proposed accord, which deals mainly with the
constitutional concerns of Quebec, will lapse if it isn't
ratified by all provincial legislatures by June 23, a legal
deadline.

   Mr. Harper, by filibustering, has already seriously
delayed the Manitoba Legislature's consideration of the
proposed ratification bill. The Manitoba government warned
that its legislature would have difficulty passing the
ratification bill by June 23 even with the cooperation of all
its 57 members, because of Manitoba's requirements for public
hearings on legislation.
   Mr. Harper, who represents a northern Manitoba
constituency, is opposed to the constitutional plan because
he believes it doesn't adequately address the concerns of
Canadian Indians and other native groups.
   Political polls in Quebec show strong support for
separation from the rest of Canada if the proposed agreement,
known as the Meech Lake Accord, isn't ratified. The
agreement, negotiated three years ago at Meech Lake, Quebec,
would recognize the largely French-speaking province as a
"distinct society" within Canada. The designation would be
used by the courts in interpreting the constitution.
   Native groups assert that they have as much claim as
Quebec to special status in the constitution. They also
object to the veto powers that the Meech Lake Accord would
grant Quebec and other provinces over future constitutional
changes, possibly affecting native rights.
   Mr. Harper delayed the Manitoba government's introduction
of the ratification bill by refusing to give his consent to a
motion that would have permitted the legislature to forgo the
usual 48 hours of notice for a new bill.
   The 48-hour notice period ended yesterday but Mr. Harper
further delayed proceedings by raising points of order and
putting 17 questions to Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon and
members of his cabinet. Mr. Harper has broad support for his
actions in Manitoba. A recent poll showed that 51% of
Manitobans thought the Meech Lake Accord should be scrapped.
   The constitutional plan also faces uncertain ratification
prospects in Newfoundland, where the legislature is scheduled
to vote late next week. Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said
he doesn't like the agreement but has urged legislators to
make up their own minds. Another holdout province, New
Brunswick, is expected to ratify the accord today. The other
seven provinces have already ratified it.
   The leaders of all parties in the Manitoba Legislature
have recommended approval of the proposed constitutional
amendments. Mr. Harper, a member of the New Democratic Party,
has broken ranks with the party's leadership.
