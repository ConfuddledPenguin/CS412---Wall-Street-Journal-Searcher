   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it cited
Balfour, Maclaine Futures Inc., a member of the exchange, for
violating exchange rules; the board levied fines on the firm
totaling $15,000.
   Balfour, a unit of New York-based Balfour, Maclaine Corp.,
was fined $10,000 for order, margin and accounting

funds were affected."
