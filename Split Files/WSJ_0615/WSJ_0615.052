   LONDON -- The Soviets are knocking on bankers' doors in
Western Europe -- and the doors are being slammed in their
faces.
   Over the past month, the Soviet Union's stubborn economic
and balance-of-payments problems have prompted a flurry of
visits by senior Soviet financial officials to Britain, West
Germany and Switzerland. The Soviets, including officials at
Moscow's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs, are seeking new
Western loans to roll over maturing credits and ease a
liquidity crunch that has led to delays on trade and other
payments to foreign creditors.

   But Western bankers report the Soviets have left the
meetings largely emptyhanded -- a consequence of increasing
Western uncertainty about the scale of Soviet economic
problems. Wary commercial bankers are demanding steeply
higher interest rates, charging Soviet borrowers up to a full
percentage point more than last year for identical credits.
The bankers also are attaching more strings, including
additional government guarantees, that make new credits
costlier.
   "The Russians have been around testing the market. But at
the moment there's no appetite" among Western bankers, says a
British banker who met with several officials from the Bank
for Foreign Economic Affairs this month. "The reason is
obvious: Economic and political uncertainties" are just too
great to advance substantial new funds.
   The banking situation, which could crimp Soviet plans for
a new imports program this year, highlights a critical
question facing restructuring economies across the East Bloc:
how to pay for change when Western banks won't foot the bill.
Money could become one of the most important political
bargaining tools in the debate on the future of Europe.
Rumors are circulating in financial circles here --
unconfirmed by German officials -- that Germany plans to
offer a multibillion-dollar bailout package in return for
Soviet agreement on unified German membership in NATO.
   While the Soviets have had some success in rolling over an
estimated $1 billion in short-term credits maturing each
month, the lack of fresh funds is forcing them to look
elsewhere for new financing -- a costlier, more cumbersome
and time-consuming process that threatens to worsen the
payments problem.
   Only one major new Soviet loan has been publicly announced
in the past six weeks: a $300 million credit from a Kuwait
bank. Soviet officials reportedly have been pressing Western
central banks to accept gold deposits as collateral for
short-term loans, a move paralleling similar private-market
transactions disclosed earlier this month. Separately, gold
prices have been weakening on reports of Soviet sales this
year; gold fell sharply in Europe yesterday as the Soviets
announced a $100 million gold-coin sale for October.
   Soviet officials say the current liquidity squeeze is
short-term and is due to an increase in imports last year.
Britain's Financial Times newspaper this week quoted Soviet
state bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko as saying Moscow
would resolve the late-payments problem by the third quarter
by selling $2 billion in commodities -- though not gold or
oil.
   Bill Newman, an official at Moscow Narodny Bank in London,
says that though "loans are not as readily available to the
Soviet Union as they were before," the credit-crunch is far
from permanent. He points to reported, but unconfirmed,
Soviet foreign-currency reserves of as much as $15 billion
and $30 billion in gold reserves.
   Nevertheless, the Soviets' continuing inability to resolve
the payments delays -- estimated at one stage at more than
$500 million -- is unsettling bankers and Western financial
officials. Bankers stress the situation is precarious. A
further weakening of confidence could lead Western banks to
avoid even rolling over old Soviet debt.
   "We still haven't found answers" for everything that's
going wrong in the Soviet Union, says a senior West German
monetary official. He adds that many West German commercial
contracts with the Soviet Union expire at the end of the
year. As long as the late-payments problem persists, the
Germans will let them lapse.
   The payments problem has tarnished the Soviet image in the
global credit markets. Unlike last year, when the Soviets
were able to raise more than $1.5 billion in the
international credit markets, they haven't been able to tap
the market since January.
   And they aren't expected to try again soon. "It would be a
bad time to launch an issue, given the Soviets' current
problems," says Andrew Bevan, a London-based economist at
Westdeutsche Landesbank, which led the last Soviet foray into
the global credit markets. That issue, a 500 million West
German mark bond, currently trades at 94 pfennigs per mark
face amount.
   Indeed, though only last year the Soviets could secure
attractive interest rates for short-term financing of as
little as 1/4 or 1/2 percentage point above London's
benchmark interbank rate, which currently stands at 8 3/8%
for three-month credits, bankers today would charge a full
percentage point or more for the same credit. That
effectively means the Soviets would pay 10% more for the same
money than last year.
