   PHILADELPHIA -- The National Association of Addiction
Treatment Providers presented The Wall Street Journal with a
special award for coverage of drug issues.
   The association of 650 private chemical dependency
treatment programs cited the Journal "for its outstanding
series, `Addiction -- America's Drug Crisis,'" published last
summer, and "for its continued, enlightened editorial focus
on alcoholism and drug dependency." The three-part series
consisted of: "Stolen Future," by Ronald G. Shafer of the
Journal's Washington bureau about the drug-related death of
his son, Ryan; "Baffling Plague," by Joseph Pereira of the
Boston bureau about addiction; and "Lifelong Struggle," by
Kenneth H. Bacon in Washington about a recovering drug addict
and alcoholic.
