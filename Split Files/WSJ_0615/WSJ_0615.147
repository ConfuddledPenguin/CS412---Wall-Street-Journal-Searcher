   WASHINGTON -- The Senate sent to the White House landmark
legislation that would guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks
annual unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or serious
family illnesses.
   The action, by a simple voice vote, sets the stage for a
potential veto confrontation with the Bush administration,
which has allied itself with business interests opposed to
such statutorily mandated benefits.

   The Senate vote gave no final measure of support, but the
same bill passed the House last month by a 237-187 margin, or
less than the two-thirds needed to override a veto.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the chief sponsor, said
he hoped to meet with the president to avert a veto, and
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) read back
Mr. Bush's pledge of a "kinder, gentler" nation before the
vote.
   Leading Republicans were unconvinced, and the Democratic
triumph is more strategic than decisive. After years of
crusading for action, Mr. Dodd has moved the issue to the
White House, but the GOP is confident it can sustain a veto
by the president. "He will veto it," said Sen. Strom Thurmond
(R., S.C.), "and the veto will be upheld."
   "Now the focus is on President Bush," said Judith
Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. "We
are by no means convinced that he will veto this bill."
   Administration officials and business groups believe such
benefits should be offered voluntarily without the government
telling companies what to do. Business advocates also raise
concerns over the cost of finding and training replacement
workers and covering health insurance for employees on leave.
They say it would reduce existing benefits and favor only
high-paid employees who can afford unpaid time off in any
case.
   Proponents of the bill say the legislation is a necessity
in a nation where many working parents are caught between the
demands of work and raising a family. Nationally, 56% of
women with children under six years old are in the work
force.
   The measure would provide 12 weeks annual unpaid leave to
cover either the employee's own medical emergency or the care
of newborn or adopted children or seriously ill family
members. Employers would be required to guarantee jobs and
continue to provide health benefits during the worker's
absence.
   Companies with fewer than 50 employees aren't covered by
the measure, which thereby exempts all but 5% of the nation's
employers. Sponsors estimate the measure would cost business
$236 million annually.
   These provisions are less stringent than those first
approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,
which exempted only employers with fewer than 20 workers and
required separate leave periods of 10 weeks in cases of
family needs and 13 weeks for medical needs, or a maximum of
23. By comparison, the bill adopted assumes a maximum of 12
weeks, said Mr. Dodd, and he argued that the reduced costs
amounted now to only a few cents a day per worker.
