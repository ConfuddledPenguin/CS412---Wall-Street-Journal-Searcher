   LOS ANGELES -- A coalition of Hollywood studios and
producers asked the Federal Communications Commission to
investigate the three major broadcast networks for alleged
violations of federal rules that restrict the networks'
ownership of programs.
   The complaint is the latest salvo in an escalating and
increasingly bitter fight between Hollywood and the networks
over federal rules that block the broadcasters from the
lucrative rerun business. The allegations came as part of a
filing that the studio coalition made yesterday to the FCC,
which is about to undertake a major review of whether the
rerun rules should be eased or lifted entirely.

   The networks and the Hollywood studios that supply most
prime-time series broke off all negotiations on Wednesday,
scuttling efforts to form a compromise plan advising the FCC
on how the rules should be eased. The FCC filing yesterday
made it clear that both sides now seem to have put aside
polite negotiation in favor of a bareknuckle brawl.
   Hollywood and the networks have been haggling for seven
years over the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication
Rules. Imposed by the FCC to rein in network power 20 years
ago, the rules forbid the networks from sharing in the
profits of rerun sales, a $3 billion-a-year business.
   That lucrative market has been largely left to Hollywood
producers because the rules prohibit the networks from owning
a partial stake in the shows produced for them by the
studios. The networks -- besieged by cable, News Corp.'s Fox
Television network and other competition that didn't exist 20
years ago -- want a share of the wealth and an elimination of
the rerun rules.
   In lodging the new charges -- which Hollywood officials
concede they probably wouldn't have pursued had they reached
a compromise with the ABC, NBC and CBS networks -- the
studios allege an "insidious network campaign to coerce
outside producers" into letting the networks own programs the
producers have proposed.
   Under the current FCC rules, most series are owned by
Hollywood studios and independent producers, while the
networks merely "license" the programming for two broadcasts.
A separate 1980 consent decree limits the networks to
producing at most five hours of their own prime time
programming, forcing them to rely on Hollywood for the rest.
   But the consent decree expires in November, and all three
networks have been revving up their own production units to
make more wholly-owned prime time fare. In the filing with
the FCC yesterday, the studios asked for a review of all
in-house contracts with producers for the last three years to
determine if the networks are pressing producers to make
shows under network contract rather than make them
independently and then license them to the network.
   Stephen A. Weiswasser, general counsel of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., said the networks deny the studios' charges.
Moreover, he said, the fact that the studios didn't bother to
file their complaint before now "tells you just how serious
the complaints are."
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association,
said the studios "knew about some of these (network
practices) all the time, but we never really got into it."
Mr. Valenti said that the studios didn't want to raise the
complaints while they were still trying to iron out a
settlement with the networks. "It's just awkward," he said.
   As talks between the two sides grew more contentious,
studio officials warned network negotiators that a complaint
alleging anti-competitive practices might be filed if they
couldn't come to an agreement. Even as they bargained, the
studios had three Washington law firms taking statements from
almost 100 Hollywood producers and writers, looking for
material to be included in the complaint. "Now we're in a
fight for our lives, and we just have no choice," Mr. Valenti
said.
   In alleging network abuses, the studio coalition charged
that the networks have "acted in parallel" in forcing
producers to agree to strikingly similar terms. Though the
three networks compete for programming, the studios say the
trio uses the same license fees, the same one-year "freeze"
that keeps a series proposal off the market when a network
buys it but doesn't use it; and the same four-year contract
commitment for a series, when the producers want a shorter
term.
   The filing, made by the "Coalition to Preserve" the rules,
said that "whether the pervasive parallelism among the
networks is the result of active coordination or simply
mutual recognition of the benefits of acting in tandem, its
existence is indisputable."
   But the Department of Justice, in a separate filing to the
FCC yesterday, provided a boost to the network side of the
dispute.
   The Justice filing said the networks "don't have
sufficient market power to adversely affect" the market for
TV programming, even if they make more of their own shows.
There is "no basis in economic theory for a presumption that
network ownership" of series reruns would hurt program
production, the Justice Department said. It called the
"practical risk" of the networks winning control of the
syndication market, if the rules are lifted, "remote" and
said the network practices that the rules forbid "might
promote competition and efficiency."
   "We urge" the FCC "to eliminate the (rerun) rules unless
the Commission concludes that they are necessary to protect
the public interest in competition," the filing said.
