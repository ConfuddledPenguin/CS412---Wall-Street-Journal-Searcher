   An advertising forecaster, citing the sluggish economy and
a "disastrous" retail market in cities across the nation,
sliced his ad spending outlook for 1990.
   Robert Coen, director of forecasting for Interpublic
Group's McCann-Erickson unit, said total U.S. ad spending
would climb 5.3% this year, not the 6.2% he forecast in
December. He lowered both his national and local advertising
forecasts but said the biggest disappointment was in local
advertising. A major problem, he told a meeting of securities
analysts, is the "disastrous retail situation in many local
markets, and a very tough short-term situation . . . in
newspaper classified."

   Mr. Coen also made his preliminary forecast for 1991,
predicting total U.S. spending would climb 7.5% to $140
billion.
   Analysts were split on whether Mr. Coen's forecast is on
the mark, with several saying it still may be too optimistic.
James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities,
noted that first-quarter ad spending figures were so weak
that budgets would have to spurt in the second half to meet
Mr. Coen's forecast.
   "I'm not convinced" that spending will increase that much
in the second half, Mr. Dougherty said. If spending continues
at its first-quarter rate, he calculates, total 1990 growth
would be about 3.5%.
   Even at Interpublic, there is some question as to whether
major advertisers will up their spending in the second half.
At the analysts meeting, Eugene Beard, Interpublic's
executive vice president, noted that the agency group's U.S.
consumer goods clients "are delaying their spending, or
spending is erratic." In an interview, he said: "I think we
will see improvement in the second half vs. the first half,
but how much I don't think anybody can say. I wouldn't dare
hazard a guess." He added that overseas spending is holding
up "fine" and that Interpublic won't need to adjust its
earnings forecast.
   Mr. Coen, though, said he was encouraged because major
advertisers appear to be spending at a faster rate than
average. "The top brands are out there like gangbusters;
there's no advertising recession among key advertising
brands," he said. Among major advertisers, food ad spending
was up 15% in the first quarter, while drug advertising was
up 18%. But other important advertisers cut spending,
including automobiles, where spending was off 2%, and two
smaller categories: cigarettes, off 26%, and computers, down
33%.
   Mr. Coen said he shaved his national ad spending estimate
-- to 5.7% from 6.3% -- partly because of weakness in
magazines and direct mail. In the first four months of this
year, magazine ad pages fell while revenue increased
slightly, reflecting lagging cigarette and car advertising.
Direct mail volume, which Mr. Coen initially expected would
see a healthy increase, has been flat so far because of
continuing fallout from a 1988 postal increase. National ad
spending should total $72.9 billion, he said.
   Local advertising is faring far worse. Mr. Coen slashed
his local spending estimate to 4.7% from 6.1% in the face of
a miserable retail market affecting both local newspaper and
TV advertising. Both were hurt by pockets of recession in
some parts of the country; classified advertising in
particular is hypersensitive to the economy. The bankruptcy
filings and financial problems of major retailers are also
factors.
   Local TV advertisers have cut back substantially in some
cases. Automobile dealers slashed their local TV spending 21%
in the first quarter, while department store advertising was
off 13%. Spending of troubled banks and savings and loan
associations was off 14%. Local spending will total $130
billion, Mr. Coen estimated.
   "It's just a desperate retail market in many parts of the
U.S.," he said. "There's no sign that there's a real big
gathering boom at the local level. The real question is
whether we've hit bottom."
   Mr. Coen estimated overseas ad spending would grow 8% in
local currencies and 5% when translated into dollars. He said
spending weakness in several countries, including the U.K.
and Australia, "is likely to turn back upward again within
the next 18 months."
   Despite Mr. Coen's downward revisions in U.S. spending,
some analysts held out hope that 1990 may yet recover,
perhaps winding up even better than Mr. Coen suggested. The
upfront market, during which major advertisers buy network TV
time for the fall season, is about to kick off now. If
upfront sales are strong, "that will set the tone for the
entire year," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. And considering the strong growth among major
advertisers pinpointed by Mr. Coen, he added, the forecast
"may come back to where {Mr. Coen} started from."

   Ad Notes. . . .

   TOBACCO ADS: As expected, Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.)
introduced a bill in Congress to restrict tobacco advertising
in the U.S. Under the bill, tobacco ads could include only a
picture of a single pack of cigarettes with text against a
white background. People could not appear in the ads. Rep.
Waxman said the legislation was designed "to stop tobacco
sales to youth and force tobacco companies to tell the truth
about the health effects of their products."
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Ted Shaine was named executive vice president
