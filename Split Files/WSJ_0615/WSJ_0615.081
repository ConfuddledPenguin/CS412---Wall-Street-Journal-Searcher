May issue of Chronicles:

   {I}t turns out that emotional bonds are not enough to
preserve the family as an autonomous social unit. Love is
insufficient when arrayed against a state apparatus that has
appropriated the functions of early child development, basic
education, economic support, recreation, civil religion and
old age security. Simply put, the comprehensive welfare state
holds all the "loyalty" trump cards in its hand.
