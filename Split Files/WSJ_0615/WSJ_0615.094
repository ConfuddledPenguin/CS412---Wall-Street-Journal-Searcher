   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan told Congress that he would expect a "significant"
drop in interest rates if the administration and Congress
agree on large deficit-reduction package.
   Mr. Greenspan's comments came just four days after the
chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers,
Michael Boskin, said it would be "irresponsible" for the Fed
not to cut rates in the wake of a budget deal. Administration
officials have worried recently that Mr. Greenspan might be
unwilling, even after a budget deal is reached, to cut
interest rates far enough or fast enough to prevent economic
problems.

   In testimony to the House Banking Committee, the Fed
chairman carefully avoided promising any action by the
central bank. Rather, he argued a "credible" budget deal
would have a direct effect on the financial markets. "There
would be a significant effect on long-term interest rates,"
he said, "and through arbitrage this will affect the short
end of the markets as well."
   He stressed that the budget deal must be "credible,"
saying: "If it's merely bookkeeping measures, I think the
market will yawn -- appropriately."
