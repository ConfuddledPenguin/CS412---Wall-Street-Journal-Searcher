   WASHINGTON -- Thousands of callers accepted Secretary of
State James Baker's invitation to call the White House when
they get "serious about peace" in the Middle East, jamming
the phone lines.
   Mr. Baker precipitated the onslaught at a House Foreign
Relations Committee hearing, when he told the new Israeli
government, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, that
Israelis must compromise if peace efforts are to succeed. Mr.
Baker said, "Everybody over there should know that the
telephone number is 1-202-456-1414. When you're serious about
peace, call us."

   About 6,000 to 8,000 individuals "on all sides of the
issue," according to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,
took Mr. Baker's invitation to heart and began calling the
White House switchboard Wednesday night and into yesterday
morning. At one point, the calls caused operators to turn to
an automatic response tape.
   Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Baker's remarks shouldn't be
construed as blaming the Israelis solely for the slow pace of
peace talks. "In the final analysis, the parties of the
region have to want peace for it to happen," he said. "And we
can't want it for them."
   The spokesman also said, "The White House operators can
expect a big Christmas present this year from the State
Department." But Mr. Baker apparently felt December would be
too late, and sent roses yesterday.
