   MONTVALE, N.J. -- Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., looking
to better its position in Europe, said it will move its world
headquarters to London and named a new chief executive
officer.
   Inter-Continental, which is jointly owned by Japan's
Saison Group and SAS Group, parent of Scandinavian Airlines
System, said the move to London will consolidate corporate
staff. It said the changes are part of a restructuring that
will result in two hotel operating divisions: the five-star
Inter-Continental hotels and the more moderately priced Forum
Hotel chain.

   The consolidation should be completed by year end, and
will mean the current corporate staff of 425 will be reduced
by about 175 people, a spokeswoman for Inter-Continental
said. Most of those layoffs will be in support and clerical
staff, but some executives will lose jobs, she said. Some
people will be offered relocation, she added.
   The company also said John van Praag was named chief
executive, succeeding John Calvert, who chose not to relocate
to London. It said he will remain in North America as an
adviser.
   Mr. van Praag, 53 years old, is on the board of Saison
Overseas Holdings B.V., the Amsterdam-based holding company
for Inter-Continental. He joined Saison Group in 1988.
   The company also said J.T. Kuhlman was named president of
the Inter-Continental hotels division, and that a president
of the Forum Hotels division should be named shortly. Mr.
Kuhlman formerly was senior vice president for
Inter-Continental in charge of its France/Mediterranean
region.
