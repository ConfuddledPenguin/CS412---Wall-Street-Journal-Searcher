   Lone Star Industries Inc. said it agreed to sell back to
Tarmac PLC the entire issue of preferred stock it holds in
Tarmac's U.S. unit for $147 million.
   Lone Star, a Stamford, Conn., cement and construction
materials producer, said the sale to Tarmac America Inc. is
part of a continuing restructuring. James E. Stewart,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement
that the sale of the Tarmac America cumulative preferred
issue and other recent restructuring actions will result in
"the realization of over $325 million, the great majority of
which will be in cash." A spokesman said the preferred resale
was done because Lone Star needs to raise cash.

   The company said the buy-back by Tarmac America is at 78%
of the preferred's par value. A spokesman said Lone Star had
been paid the preferred by Tarmac in exchange for some of its
North American operations.
   The transaction is subject to creation of a new class of
preference stock that Tarmac shareholders will be asked to
approve at a special meeting scheduled July 20, Lone Star
said. Tarmac is a British homebuilder and
construction-materials supplier.
