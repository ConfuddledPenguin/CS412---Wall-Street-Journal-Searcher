   Darn That Democracy]

   The recent dramatic world changes
   Have left many people annoyed;
   Suddenly, out of nowhere,
   They feel a tremendous void.
   It isn't that these onlookers
   Are unhappy or do not care,
   But all at once they have to find
   A channel for anger elsewhere.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   Blackout
                                                                                                       

   I can rid my mind of thoughts,
   Leaving a clean slate.
   Plans, problems, notions --
   All tend to dissipate.
   It's a recurring talent
   That always reaches peak
   When I'm before a group
   And just about to speak.
   -- Joshua Adams.

   Balancing Act?
                                                                                                       

   In our low-budget driving vacation plan,
   The theory has some holes,
   As what's saved on lodging and dining
   Gets spent on gas and tolls.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.
