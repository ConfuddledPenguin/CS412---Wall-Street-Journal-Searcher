   Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., said it filed suit
against Du Pont Co., alleging patent infringement.
   The suit was filed in federal court in San Francisco. Like
another suit Cetus has pending against Du Pont, the action
alleges that Du Pont is selling products that infringe on
Cetus's patented polymerase chain-reaction technology.

   Considered a significant scientific advance, the
technology allows the rapid multiplication of gene sequences
and is used in molecular biology research and diagnostics,
among other areas.
   The suit seeks to prohibit Du Pont from infringing on
Cetus' patents and asks for unspecified damages.
   Cetus is a biotechnology company that develops health care
products. Du Pont also manufactures biomedical products.
   A spokesman for Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., said
it doesn't believe Cetus's patents are valid, and said Du
Pont intends to continue selling the products targeted by
Cetus's new suit.
