   These bartenders pour only one kind of booze, and they
don't talk back.
   Liquor company Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons challenged
students at six leading U.S. design schools to come up with
"Rube Goldberg-like contraptions" for pouring its expensive
Crown Royal Canadian whiskey. The Seagram Co. unit got the
idea from one of its ads in which a slingshot-golf
ball-mouse-clown-balloon arrangement appeared to cause a
bottle of Crown Royal to tip into a glass.

   The device didn't actually work, but the marketers last
year decided to launch a search for one that did. The rules
required each gizmo to have a running time of one to five
minutes, and to be at least two feet by two feet by three
feet in size. The grand-prize winner, announced yesterday, is
a joint entry by Dan Schwab and Dave Banko from North
Carolina State University; they get a $5,000 prize and their
contraption will tour the country with other winning entries
in September. Seagram also gave $5,000 to each school to help
pay for work on the contraptions.
   Gizmos ranged from a rather linear
balls-moved-by-ramps-and-pistons machine (Minneapolis College
of Art and Design) to the grand-prize-winning multihued
jungle gym of pipes that uses a pendulum, ramps and rolling
and bouncing colored balls to tip the bottle.
   Push a daisy on Miguel Calvo's campy, gilt-framed
thingamajig, and as "Tea for Two" plays in the background,
clouds part, Crown Royal rains into a glass and a kewpie doll
releases a golden stream over some dead flowers. Mr. Calvo, a
student at New York's Parsons School of Design, says:
"Instead of designing fax machines, here I can do gold frames
and kewpie dolls. It's fun."
   Kim Kwan, of the California College of Arts and Crafts
would only show his invention on a videotape, which he
acknowledges is really a spliced reconstruction. But, he
says: "It works conceptually. It doesn't work 100% of the
time. It was too complex to run at this demo."
   Rube Goldberg would have approved of the contest, says one
of the judges who ought to know. "The idea is to spark
creativity," says George W. George, a theatrical and film
producer and Rube Goldberg's son. "My father's long-standing
appeal was to show how the simplest task, such as opening a
garage door, can be complicated by machines and that human
ideas are what really make things work, not the machine
itself."
