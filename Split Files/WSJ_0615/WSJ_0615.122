   TOKYO -- Japanese corporations reported an average 8.3%
pretax earnings increase in the fiscal year ended March 31,
or a total of 10.050 trillion yen ($64.3 billion), owing to
brisk domestic demand such as personal consumption and
corporate equipment investment, the Tokyo Stock Exchange
said.
   Exchange officials said a study of fiscal 1989 earnings
reports submitted by 959 of the companies listed on the
market also showed that net profits went up 13% from the
previous fiscal year to 4.845 trillion yen and sales jumped
17% to 310.687 trillion yen.

   Another study, of 1,067 companies, indicated that fiscal
1990 pretax earnings will grow more slowly, by 2.2%. Net
profits will rise 5.4% and sales 1.5%, according to exchange
officials.
   While Japanese companies, as in the previous fiscal year,
posted profit gains in fiscal 1989, they said, the pace of
growth slowed because of the yen's decline and higher oil
prices. In fiscal 1988, pretax earnings surged 25%.
   Fiscal 1989 manufacturer pretax earnings rose 11% and
sales 7.9%, showing gains for the third consecutive year. In
contrast, non-manufacturer earnings languished, displaying a
3.2% gain despite a 23% surge in sales due to substantial
declines incurred by electric power and gas suppliers as a
result of rate cutbacks, higher oil prices and the yen's
decline. When power and gas companies were excluded, for
instance, non-manufacturer earnings went up 17%, officials
noted.
   They said 26 industries, including real estate, shipping
and petroleum, reported gains in sales in fiscal 1989. Only
one, agriculture-fishery-forestry, showed a drop, they said.
   The shipping industry posted a 98% surge in pretax
earnings due to recovery in shipping world-wide and
restructuring efforts that included rounds of layoffs and
removal of cost-ineffective ships from operations.
   Brisk demand for machine tools and construction machines
pushed pretax earnings by machinery manufacturers up 30%
above the fiscal 1988 levels, while the construction industry
showed a 26% gain owing to a private-sector construction boom
during the year.
   Rising market prices of copper, zinc and other metals
combined with demand for processed metal alloys and
construction materials to boost profits by the nonferrous
metal industry by 21%.
