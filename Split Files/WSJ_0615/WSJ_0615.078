   Donald Trump's major creditors worked last night to meet a
deadline for the beleaguered developer to make a bond payment
today.
   As negotiations crawled into the night, some people close
to the talks were pessimistic that nearly $30 million in
interest and principal on Trump's Castle bonds would be paid
as part of a massive restructuring of the casino and real
estate mogul's empire. If the interest and principal are not
made, it would be the first time Mr. Trump has missed a
scheduled payment on his approximately $1.3 billion in
publicly traded debt.

   People close to the negotiations stressed that even if Mr.
Trump misses the deadline, he has between 10 and 30 days
before he can be found in default.
   Four New York City banks have been trying to convince 54
smaller creditors on the merits of a plan that would allow
Mr. Trump to receive $60 million and restructure $2 billion
in bank debt, including the suspension of interest payments.
In return, Mr. Trump would forfeit equity in many of his
projects and continue to pay interest to holders of about
$1.3 billion in casino debt.
   The four banks, Bankers Trust Corp., Chase Manhattan
Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover Corp., have
declined to say whether a scheduled payment on Trump's Castle
bonds would be met. It isn't believed that such a payment
would be made until the banks strike a deal among themselves.
   Over the past week, a number of foreign banks which
participated in syndications have refused to go along with
the restructuring plan. Also, some New Jersey banks
originally balked at the proposal, although they now appear
to be amenable to the plan.
   A number of bond traders speculated that Mr. Trump's
silence and that of the banks may mean bad news. If Mr. Trump
and the banks planned to make the payment, they said, they
would have put an end to the guessing game and announced that
the money would be paid.
   Roger Stone, a political consultant who also works for Mr.
Trump, reportedly said on a television show taped yesterday
that the payment would be made. But Mr. Trump's spokesman,
Howard Rubenstein, said: "{Mr. Trump's} position is that
Roger Stone is totally uninvolved with our financial
activities and it was his own opinion and should not be
construed in any way other than that."
   Mr. Rubenstein declined to say whether Mr. Trump would
make the payment today. Another person familiar with the
situation said the trustee for the bondholders was told to be
ready to receive a payment today.
   Mr. Stone couldn't be reached for comment.
