   Armstrong World Industries Inc. said it completed the
second phase of the sale of Georgia woodlands to an
undisclosed buyer, resulting in a pretax gain of $40 million
for the second quarter.
   In the 1989 second quarter, the Lancaster, Pa., flooring
and building products maker had profit from continuing
operations of $44.6 million, or 95 cents a share. Net income
was $47.9 million, or $1.02 a share.

   The first part of the sale, completed March 30, resulted
in a first-quarter gain of $16.5 million, or 40 cents a
share. The second-quarter gain is expected to exceed that
amount.
   Armstrong said it sold a total of 89,000 acres of
woodlands, which were a source of raw materials and fuel for
the company's ceiling products. The company said it will fill
its ceiling needs through other sources.
