   Jack Eckerd Corp., Clearwater, Fla., said it plans to
liquidate or sell about 120 of the 220 drug stores it agreed
to acquire from Revco D.S. Inc.
   Separately, the drug-store operator said it obtained
commitments from investors to purchase not less than $100
million of senior secured notes, due 1997. The company said
it plans to use proceeds from the notes for working capital
and to reduce other indebtedness.
