   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp.'s successful $2.46
billion bid for New Zealand's state-owned telephone company
will provide an unusual opportunity for both regional Bells
to operate in a market with minimal government restraint.
   Unlike the U.S. telecommunications industry, which is
subject to substantial state and federal regulation, New
Zealand's system is widely perceived as a free-for-all.
Although a few restrictions apply to rate increases, no
government agency is responsible for enforcement of telephone
policies. Customers with grievances generally seek relief by
filing suit.

   The lack of government interference in New Zealand is "one
of the attractions" of buying Telecom Corp., said Louis J.
Rutigliano, Ameritech's executive vice president, corporate
strategy, who was an architect of the joint bid.
   For Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, learning how to operate
in a much less structured environment could help in preparing
for the day when most of the U.S. market will have looser,
incentive-based regulation instead of the traditional
rate-of-return limits on profitability.
   "The New Zealand government took it upon itself in 1987 to
totally deregulate the telecommunications marketplace, which
is something we have been espousing in the U.S. for a while,"
Mr. Rutigliano said. "This is a chance for us to understand
what it means and to prepare this company for increasing
competition."
   Telecom, with 16,500 employees, 1.1 million customers and
annual revenue of about $1.3 billion, represents an
attractive prize. The company expects its network to be 90%
digital by the end of this year. The government will keep a
special-rights preference share, locally nicknamed the "Kiwi"
share, that will enable it to influence Telecom's future
ownership structure and ensure that the new owners don't cut
phone service or raise prices too sharply.
   The New Zealand joint-purchase agreement, announced late
Wednesday night, also represents a strategic victory for the
two Bells. Recently, both have intensified their efforts to
gain prominent footholds overseas after failing in their
collaborative bid last year for a license to build and
operate a private cellular-phone system in West Germany.
   The auction of Telecom for the New Zealand government was
managed by CS First Boston Group, a New York investment
banking firm, and the New Zealand firm of Buttle Wilson Ltd.
Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit represented Ameritech
and Bell Atlantic in the talks.
   People familiar with the auction process said the
government's decision to choose Ameritech and Bell Atlantic
was strongly influenced by the "cleanness" and simplicity of
their joint bid and by the participation, although initially
only token, of two New Zealand companies.
   As part of the agreement, the Freightways Holdings Ltd.
conglomerate and Fay, Richwhite Holdings Ltd. merchant bank
will buy a stake of less than 1% in Telecom that will
increase to 10% over the next three years. During the same
period, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech will reduce their
combined stake to 49.9% by making a series of public stock
offerings in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.,
beginning as early as 1991. Salomon is expected to have a
role in managing those offerings.
   In winning Telecom, the two Bells outmaneuvered several
U.S., Australian, U.K. and New Zealand rivals, including a
joint venture of Southwestern Bell Corp. and OTC Ltd., an
Australian long-distance phone company; Cable &amp; Wireless PLC,
a giant U.K. company that owns Hong Kong Telecom, among other
businesses; Brierley Investments Ltd., a New Zealand
investment firm with stakes in several U.S. industrial
companies; and Fletcher Challenge, a building products and
timber concern that is the largest company in New Zealand.
   People familiar with the bids speculated that Ameritech
and Bell Atlantic prevailed because theirs was a direct,
unencumbered offer for 100% of the company. That apparently
reassured the New Zealand government that it could get a full
price immediately, without having to risk that subsequent
stock offerings might go sour.
   Some people who monitored the deliberations said the
successful bid was priced at about the same amount or only
slightly higher than competing bids. According to these
people, the leading rival was the joint venture of
Southwestern Bell and OTC. That venture apparently didn't
include any New Zealand partners, and it may have bid for
only a 49.9% stake in New Zealand Telecom. There were also
indications that some members of the New Zealand cabinet had
qualms about Australian ownership of part of the country's
phone system.
   Wall Street didn't find encouragement in the news. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech's
shares fell 75 cents to close at $64.25, while Bell
Atlantic's shares slipped 62.5 cents to close at $51.75.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it placed Bell Atlantic on its
CreditWatch list with negative implications, citing the
company's already heavy debt load and the prospects of
borrowing much more to finance its 50% share of the purchase.
   "This is a good time for us to demonstrate how judicial
restraint affects us," said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond
Smith, referring to the consent decree that broke up the Bell
System. The decree bars the seven regional Bell companies
from owning the content of information services, from
manufacturing telecommunications equipment and from providing
long-distance service in the U.S.
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are expected to seek waivers
to allow them to provide international long-distance service
from New Zealand to the U.S. and its territories. In the
meantime, the pact calls for the New Zealand partners to set
up a separate company to handle that telecommunications
traffic. A spokesman for Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic
said it amounted to less than 3% of Telecom revenue.
   In the U.S., the Bells are also barred from providing
cable television service in their territories, and there is
no such restriction in New Zealand. There is no cable
industry either. Both Bells say no plans have been made, but
cable is a potentially lucrative service that they could
provide as the country's network is upgraded.
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are aware that they face some
tension from New Zealanders, many of whom weren't happy with
the idea of selling the phone company to foreigners. "We
weren't known very well, and the government did have to work
with the fact that the local populace wasn't in favor of
selling off an asset such as Telecom" to foreigners, Mr.
Rutigliano of Chicago-based Ameritech said. "But the reality
was there wasn't enough capital in New Zealand to cover such
a large acquisition."
