   NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed as foreign exchange
traders generally pushed it higher despite concerns the
Federal Reserve might ease credit.
   While traders and economists agreed the May producer price
index figures, released yesterday, leave plenty of room for
the Fed to push down interest rates, the data weren't
compelling enough that the Fed would be forced to ease.

   Hedging against the outside chance of a slight producer
price rise of about 0.1% on the month, the market took
short-dollar positions Wednesday and early yesterday, traders
said. When Labor Department data showed the index rose 0.3%,
higher than the consensus forecast of 0.2%, they squared
their positions, lifting the dollar.
   But no one was ready to take any big risks with the key
U.S. data scheduled for release today, traders said.
   Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6935
marks, up from 1.6865 marks late Wednesday. The U.S. currency
also was changing hands at 154.17 yen, down from 154.75 yen.
Sterling was trading at $1.7080, below $1.7115.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at about 154.25 at
midmorning, down from 154.50 soon after the opening; it
closed Thursday in Tokyo at 153.53 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.6930 marks.
   Dealers said the market, especially thin Thursday because
of a holiday in West Germany, was dominated by professional
participants and institutional speculators, with large
industrial customers refraining from placing orders.
   The result, said Ian Foakes, foreign exchange manager for
PaineWebber International, was "short-time plays, which lead
to a nervous, self-correcting market," rather than one that
could establish a trend.
   Ever since the report at the beginning of this month that
U.S. employment was weak in May, market participants have
been waiting for monetary easing.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. reported that May retail sales also
had been anemic, falling 0.7%. Reports today on May consumer
prices and industrial production and the April trade balance
are assumed to be all that the U.S. central bank needs to
make its decision.
   U.S. administration and Congressional pressure for easing
is strong. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady gave the Fed a
strong hint yesterday by saying he is encouraged by the PPI
report. But Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, in
apparent reply, said that interest rates will fall "very
significantly" if a credible federal budget deficit reduction
accord is reached.
   PPI's seasonally adjusted gain from April, before
rounding, represents a 3.1% compounded annual rate. So far in
calendar 1990, the PPI has risen at a 4% compounded annual
rate.
   Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly called for an inflation rate
that has zero effect on investment, spending and saving
decisions. That would mean an annual price increase rate of
1% to 2%, said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
   "{Thursday's} report is not going to change the Fed's mind
{about credit policy}. The core change in prices is not
enough to make any central banker uncomfortable," Mr. Kellner
said. Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy,
rose only 0.2% in May.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $345.55 an ounce.
