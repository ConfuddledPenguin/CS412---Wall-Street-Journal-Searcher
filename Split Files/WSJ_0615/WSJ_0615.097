   NEW YORK -- The Soviet Union will begin to mint a new gold
coin in October 1990, its first for distribution to the West
on a large scale since the Moscow Olympic coin in 1980.
   Congress has banned importation of Soviet gold coins since
1985, a ban that was partly due to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. Victor Barron, chairman of Golden Dove
Distribution (International) Ltd. of London, the Soviet
coin's sole distributor, said, "It would be a travesty if
this ban {on the Soviet coin} was not now lifted in the U.S."

   The limited-issue coin will feature the word "peace" in
five languages and the symbol of a dove with an olive branch.
The reverse of the coin will be inscribed with the words
"Glasnost," the Soviet policy of openness, "Perestroika," or
restructuring, and "Mikhail Gorbachev," the Soviet president.
The coin will be 99.9% pure gold in one-ounce, half-ounce and
quarter-ounce sizes, denominated at 200, 100 and 50 rubles,
respectively.
