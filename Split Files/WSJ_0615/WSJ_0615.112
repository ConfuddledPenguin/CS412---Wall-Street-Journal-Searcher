   Marx once wrote that history occurs twice, first as
tragedy then as farce. Maybe he had the flag-burning debate
in mind.
   Five Supreme Court justices made this city's day on Monday
by striking down Congress's flag-desecration law. In striking
down a similar Texas law (also by 5-4) last year, the court
had caught everyone by surprise. This time everyone had lines
memorized, moves choreographed. "L.A. Law" should be this
entertaining.

   George Bush headed for the Rose Garden to say that
flag-burning "endangered the fabric of our country," no pun
intended. He accepted a replica of the Iwo Jima Memorial and
plugged his constitutional amendment to protect the flag.
Yesterday (Flag Day, of course) he popped over to the Vietnam
Memorial for reveille. The only missing prop was Mike Dukakis
to debate the pledge of allegiance.
   Bob Dole was even more inventive, departing the White
House waving a miniature flag with his left hand. The Senate
minority leader had everyone laughing with a vow to use a
flag-amendment vote against opponents in "a 30-second TV
spot." He wasn't kidding. By Flag Day, he'd assembled a dozen
senators along with the Amvets, disabled vets, you-name-it
vets for a flag-waving gala on the Capitol lawn. Jaunty and
back-slapping, he looked like he hadn't had this much fun
since the 1988 Iowa primary.
   All of this drove opponents to sputtering fury. "Cheap
politics]" cried Ron Brown, the Democratic Party chairman,
suddenly shocked-shocked] -- to find demagoguery in
Washington. Pat Schroeder, the Colorado constitutionalist,
was beside herself when her House subcommittee failed to kill
a flag-desecration amendment. She called it a GOP "reprieve
from the S&amp;L crisis, the deficit crisis, the
education-environment or any other crisis we're in."
   On a roll, she moved right past Tailgunner Joe to the Big
Bertha of scare-metaphors, the Fuhrer. "One of the first
things Hitler did was make flag burning a crime in Nazi
Germany," Ms. Schroeder declared, though of course what
Hitler really did was change his country's flag. Tom Wolfe
once observed that the left constantly worries that the long
night of fascism is about to descend in America, though the
only place it ever seems to land is Europe.
   Even more creatively, Ohio Democrat James Traficant, the
House's stand-up comic, said that while he hated flag-burning
he hated even more that the burning flags are made in Japan
and Korea.
   A year ago I opposed the flag amendment, on grounds that
conservatives should be conservative about amending the
Constitution. Liberals are more creative amenders, after all.
But after watching this week's spectacle, I now think I was
as stuffy as James J. Kilpatrick. Anything that creates such
uproar among Washington's elites must have something going
for it. Consider some of the benefits:
   First, a friend points out, a flag amendment will restore
dignity to flag-burners. What honor is there in protest if
you can't shock the bourgeoisie by breaking its laws? An
amendment will make flags worth burning again.
   Second, the flag debate will deflect the demagoguery that
will soon surround Mr. Bush's veto of the civil-rights
(racial quotas) bill. Democrats are maneuvering for a veto
during the visit by South African hero Nelson Mandela later
this month. One cheap political shot deserves another.
   Third, and more seriously, a good constitutional brawl can
contribute now and then to a healthy democracy. As every
political scientist knows, the Supreme Court is protected
from, but also sensitive to, public opinion. Every so often
the Justices have shown they need a populist tonic to remind
them who's boss.
   This is especially true on the First Amendment, which even
this supposedly "conservative" Supreme Court has turned into
a cudgel to beat community standards. The First Amendment
protects "speech," especially the political speech essential
to self-government. But by now virtually any act or
"expression" (not merely speech) that can be given the least
artistic or political tinge is said to be outside the
judgment of any community.
   It's no accident that the creator of the raunchy rap album
banned in Miami, "As Nasty As They Wanna Be," thinks the flag
decision is a harbinger of his case. This is, after all, the
same court that last year said Pittsburgh couldn't put a
Christmas creche in a public place unless it also put up
"secular" symbols (Frosty the Snowman).
   The great legal scholar and civil libertarian, Alexander
Bickel, once wrote that, "we do need, individually and as a
society, some values, some belief in the foundations of our
conduct, in order to make life bearable." In that context he
also wrote, "Freedom of speech, with us, is a compromise, an
accommodation." If a community decides its foundations
include not burning the flag, the compromise hardly means
book burning is around the corner.
   The flag-amendment is a rebuke, admittedly crude, to
justices who overturned 48 state laws -- and now a national
law -- codifying community respect for a national symbol. It
says to the court, on this one you've gone too far. It says:
Some "rights" violate the nation's -- the community's --
democratic right to codify common values in law. If a little
flag-waving goes along for the ride, remember who picked this
fight.
