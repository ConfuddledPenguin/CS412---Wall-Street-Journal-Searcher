   MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. told analysts
that earnings estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter ending
June 30 appear "too optimistic" because of soft sales in the
U.S. and the United Kingdom.
   The announcement led to a mild sell-off of Digital's often
volatile stock. The shares fell $1.75 to $86.375 in heavy New
York Stock Exchange composite trading of 1,171,700 shares.

   Some analysts said the softness in the U.K. may presage
poor results for other computer companies as well since
European sales have been a bright spot for many large
computer companies.
   "I wouldn't be surprised to see some cuts in other stocks
before we're finished," with this quarter, said Stephen
Smith, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   A Digital spokesman said most analysts had been
forecasting net income of $1.60 to $1.80 a share for the
fourth quarter compared with a year earlier when the company
earned $2.51 a share, on net income of $313.2 million. After
the announcement, analysts said they weren't sure how far to
cut their Digital estimates but some trimmed them to as low
as $1.25 a share.
   James M. Osterhoff, Digital's vice president-finance, told
a Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. conference that "our current
rate of profitability doesn't meet the expectations of our
investors -- or ourselves." He added: "The U.S. market
continues to be sluggish for us, and certain international
markets are experiencing softness, such as the U.K. where
high interest rates are cutting business expansion."
   Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter, said that
besides the economic problems in major markets Digital has
been caught in a bad product cycle. At the high end,
customers are awaiting deliveries of the VAX 9000, Digital's
first powerful mainframe computer. Although originally
expected early in the fourth quarter, Digital now says there
won't be any significant revenue from the VAX 9000 until
fiscal 1991. And many analysts don't expect much impact until
the second quarter of that year.
   In addition, Mr. Stevens said, sales of Digital's small
VAX 3000 computers, which had been strong earlier this year,
have weakened recently because customers expect Digital to
announce replacement products next month at its DECWorld
trade show. That weakness "is breaking the camel's back," he
said.
   Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, said investors hadn't been counting on a strong
fourth quarter for Digital and had been looking to 1991
instead. "If it had been a giant surprise the stock would
have come down 30%," she said.
   Nevertheless, some analysts cut their estimates for fiscal
1991 as well because they expect the economic problems to
reduce benefits from the new product cycle. Mr. Stevens said
he expects fiscal 1990 pershare earnings of about $4.10,
rising to $8.35 in fiscal 1991. PaineWebber's Mr. Smith
predicted fiscal 1991 net of about $7.50 a share.
   In fiscal 1989, net income was $1.07 billion, or $8.45 a
share, on revenue of $12.74 billion.
