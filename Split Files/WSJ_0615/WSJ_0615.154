   Rubbermaid Inc. said it purchased EWU AG, a Swiss producer
of floor care supplies and equipment, for cash, but declined
to disclose the price.
   Privately held EWU expects sales of about $15 million for
1990, Rubbermaid said.

   Rubbermaid said it made the acquisition primarily to
strengthen its European distribution system for floor care
products. The Swiss concern also produces some items that
Rubbermaid doesn't currently manufacture, which will be added
to Rubbermaid's U.S. product line, the company said.
   Rubbermaid is a Wooster, Ohio, producer of rubber and
plastic products ranging from housewares to toys; it also has
a unit that produces commercial products for food service,
sanitary maintenance, health care and other applications.
