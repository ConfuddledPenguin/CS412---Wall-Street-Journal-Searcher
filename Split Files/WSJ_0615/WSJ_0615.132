   When pollsters ask Europeans these days whether they want
a single currency, the answer often comes back "yes."
Everyone seems to agree that having a single currency would
be more efficient. According to this argument, a single
currency would make it possible to avoid the transaction
costs of flexible or badly managed exchange rates. But, to be
fair, the pollsters ought to phrase their query this way:
"How much inflation are you ready to bear for the benefit of
having a single European currency?"
   The truth is that a single currency could bring inflation.
To their question, the pollsters should append a table
showing the rate at which that inflation could grow: starting
with 2% and jumping two points at a time up to 10%, then five
points at a time up to 20%, and 10 points thereafter.

   The problem is that "joining" a currency means locking in
to the policy of its central bank. Few Europeans would have
plumped for an obligatory European currency at the cost of
Brazilian-style hyperinflation or British stop-and-go.
Indeed, Brazil does have the advantage of a single currency,
but it's likely that many Brazilians would prefer not to be
forced to use the cruzeiro. And in Britain, the Scots could
have done without Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
and his political cycle.
   Last year European Commission President Jacques Delors
presented a report that spelled out stages for the creation
of a European currency. It was drawn up by central bank
governors and experts from different parts of the Common
Market, and approved by assembled heads of state in Madrid
last summer. That document, though, does little to ease
worries over the quality of the proposed united currency. Nor
does it provide much information on how the current European
Monetary System is supposed to evolve into a full-blown
monetary union.
   Guarantees for a sound European currency are no more than
implicit. The Delors Report proposes a European Federal Bank
along the lines of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. The
European System of Central Banks -- or EuroFed -- would enjoy
a modicum of independence from state and European Community
political powers, "through the appropriate guarantee of
stability" of the members of its council.
   The Delors Report mentions "price stability" as the
objective of the EuroFed's monetary policy. But it would
prohibit lending to member-countries or to the EC as a whole,
and this would be a weak barrier against inflation.
   The EC Commission and European Parliament have already
started to talk about how they would control the EuroFed.
And, it should be noted, the American Fed has not been
exemplary in its behavior over the years. Its policy errors
deepened the crisis of 1929 and turned it into a world
depression. The Fed has also given us sorry instances of
monetary stop-go, or rather "go-stop," as when it aided
President Lyndon Johnson in simultaneously financing the
Vietnam War and the War on Poverty with the printing press;
or when it allowed Richard Nixon to decouple the dollar from
gold; or when the monetary follies of Jimmy Carter had to be
corrected by Paul Volcker putting his foot on the brakes in
the early Reagan years.
   The Delors Report doesn't mention this, but the truth is
that the West German mark would be the dominant element in
any unified currency -- however it may be defined. The
Bundesbank, the German central bank, is expected to prove a
foil against inflationary temptations. West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has openly called for an independent EuroFed on
the model of the Bundesbank. But recent events have shown the
Bundesbank, this linchpin of the EuroFed, to be anything but
a model of independence.
   After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Milton Friedman
advocated that the East German and West German mark be put on
a free float. The two currencies would have found their
level. For a time, a cheap exchange rate would have
compensated for the low productivity of communist firms and
Eastern workers. Any excess human exodus could have been
reversed when overcrowding and unemployment in the West made
steadily improving conditions in the East relatively more
attractive. If necessary, funds to compensate the East
Germans for many years of suffering could have been collected
through a special tax levied on the West.
   These are powerful arguments. However, at least one
central bank governor and one Delors Committee expert derided
this proposal as "politically unrealistic." The solution
imposed by Chancellor Kohl was to force the hand of the
"independent" Bundesbank to impose the exchange rate he found
electorally expedient: One-to-one. The transformation of the
East thus will be unduly trammeled. The likely extension of
West Germany's social security system to the less productive
ex-communist Laender will reinforce the likelihood of a
Puerto Rican situation developing there.
   The Bundesbank can now choose either to sterilize this
increase of the monetary base and push interest rates up, or
not sterilize and permit a higher rate of inflation. What can
users of the West German mark do? Lump it and bear the higher
interest rates, or the speedier price inflation, or a
combination of the two. And the Germans can say: "If you
don't like it, stop using the mark." Precisely.
   That, up to a point, is the solution. But under a wider
European Monetary System, Europeans would have no such
liberty. In that case, the unilateral decision of West
Germany would mean the entry of German-created inflation
through the back door.
   What would happen if the present or an enhanced
competition among European currencies were to continue or to
develop? If the advantages of having a single European
currency -- be it the mark or a redefined ECU -- were so
overwhelming, Europeans would choose to use it. It is most
unlikely that even then the mark would monopolize Europe.
Different moneys would predominate in each place for
different uses -- if no controls were placed on currencies
throughout the Common Market.
   The division could also be geographic. It could happen
that the mark would not predominate in every region, despite
its historical superiority. There might be regions preferring
a slightly riskier currency because they temporarily need
more credit: The rate of interest would therefore be
sustainably higher in outlying parts. In other words, there
is no saying whether the monetary zone should coincide with,
or be larger or smaller than, the Common Market.
   Free currency competition and flexible exchange rates are
the cheapest kind of regional policy. During the time when a
poorer region lags behind, a relatively weak exchange rate
can help the region compete.
   The Delors Report's answer to the regional harshness of an
imposed single currency is to propose handing out grants to
underprivileged regions. But it will be near impossible to
fine-tune these handouts to compensate for the difference
between transaction-cost benefits of a single currency, and
losses that result from being forced to use the German
interest rate. Given the political mechanisms of the Common
Market, this proposal could well develop into another subsidy
mess like Europe's Common Agricultural Policy.
   The main argument for a single currency is reduction in
financial transaction costs. But higher prices could negate
this "reduction." Local prices would reflect costs that used
to be expressed in exchange rates. A better model is the
flexible exchange-rate system in place between the U.S. and
Canada today. Obviously, a single currency is not needed for
economic union. A customs union with North America -- not a
currency union -- would be right for Mexico. The truth is
that the only good argument against letting Europeans choose
what currencies they will use is political, not economic.
   Some defend the EuroFed with the argument that a new
central bank would play the same role toward Europe's more
inflationary countries that the International Monetary Fund
plays for the underdeveloped nations of the Third World:
bogyman. This is a sorry comment on their and Europe's
democratic institutions. However, if this is so, why do the
central bankers of those inflation-prone nations want to be
present in the councils of the EuroFed?
   A final argument for a European currency is that there can
be no United States of Europe without a single currency.
This, indeed, is the most frightening argument. The original
principle was to build a European confederation that
maintained the possibility of secession. History has shown us
many sad examples of confederations transformed into
centralized, high-spending federations. Often, the result was
civil war: Look at England and Scotland in 1707, Switzerland
in 1848, Nigeria in 1970, and, perhaps, the Soviet Union in
the 1990s. Symbols of undivided sovereignty are a portent of
danger.
