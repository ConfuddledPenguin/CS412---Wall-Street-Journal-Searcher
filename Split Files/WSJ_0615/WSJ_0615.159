   The musical rap group 2 Live Crew, already under attack in
Florida for its allegedly obscene lyrics, is now under fire
in South Carolina.
   James Anders, the solicitor, or district attorney, for
Richland County, S.C., ordered 25 local record dealers to
remove the group's album, "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," from
their shelves yesterday. Mr. Anders said a county resident
had complained about the album's lyrics to police, who in
turn brought a copy of the recording to Mr. Anders.

   "It's filthy," said Mr. Anders. "You hear nothing {on the
album} but raw sexual filth. It has no socially redeeming
features whatsoever."
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., reached essentially the same conclusion
when he ruled the album to be obscene. The decision resulted
in the arrest of a record store owner who was selling the
album and members of the rap group after a performance
Saturday.
   Telephone calls to the group's office in Miami yesterday
weren't returned.
   South Carolina statutes authorize county solicitors to
determine initially whether a record, magazine or other work
is obscene. Arrests stemming from the decision, said Mr.
Anders, are brought before a state circuit judge. If the
judge also deems the material to be obscene, the case then
goes to a state grand jury and finally is heard by a jury in
the original locale.
   "We're not trying to indict this group," said Mr. Anders,
who has given record dealers 10 days to stop selling the
music. "We just don't want this material on our shelves.
There may be other communities across the country that may
want to have this. But for us, there's nothing {on the album}
that would be of benefit to a juvenile or even an adult."

   JUDGE LAMBASTES IRS for "bureaucratic incompetence."
   In a 10-page opinion, U.S. District Judge B. Avant
Edenfield in Savannah, Ga., ordered an IRS agent removed from
a case involving a convenience-store owner who owed back
taxes. The judge, who had ordered the store seized May 10
after the agent filed an affidavit, vowed never again to
"trust {the agent's} testimony or that of her supervisor."
   The case involved Brenda Stout, a Garden City, Ga., gas
and convenience store owner who was in arrears for 1987 taxes
because of an accounting error. According to Judge
Edenfield's opinion, IRS agent Sherilyn Heyward quoted four
different figures to Mrs. Stout, each one progressively
higher, between September 1988 and May 1989. Mrs. Stout's
bill ultimately came to $96,915.34.
   Each time, Mrs. Stout arranged financing to pay the IRS.
But in December 1989, with $7,532 still owed to the IRS, she
fell into default on a payment agreement with the IRS and put
the store up for sale. According to Judge Edenfield, Mrs.
Heyward tried to freeze Mrs. Stout's bank account, then
sought a seizure order from him last week by claiming,
inaccurately, that Ms. Stout had changed her bank account and
was taking cash from the store.
   When six IRS agents raided the store, according to the
judge, they refused to inform Mrs. Stout and her husband of
their rights, and seized, among other items, $2.46 that
belonged to an employee and $75 that belonged to an
uninvolved party. Mrs. Stout complained to the U.S.
attorney's office in Savannah, which requested a hearing
before the judge.
   "The court heard a story of bureaucratic incompetence,
aggravated by arrogance and hostility toward those the
bureaucracy was intended to serve . . . ," Judge Edenfield
wrote. "While the IRS's actions in this case may not have
been illegal or even contrary to department policy, they were
wrong in the purest sense of the word," he added.
   A spokesman for the IRS apologized for any "perception
that we are rude and arrogant" but declined to discuss the
case. Mrs. Stout's attorney, Harold J. Cronk, called her one
of "the silent majority" of taxpayers who run afoul of the
IRS.
   "We still don't know what she owes," Mr. Cronk said. The
IRS office in Atlanta tallied $6,980, he said, but the
Savannah office came up with $2,617.

   STUDENT'S SUIT OVER GRADES dismissed by state appeals
court.
   The Court of Appeals in New York dismissed the complaint
of a law student who had been ejected from New York Law
School for failing to meet the school's academic standards.
   In its opinion, the seven-judge panel ruled, "As a general
rule, judicial review of grading disputes would
inappropriately involve the courts in the very core of
academic and educational decision-making."
   Susan "M.," as the former student is called in court
papers, had asked a lower court to reinstate her as a law
student. The court dismissed her case but was partially
overturned by New York's Appellate Division, which ruled that
the law school should review one grade she disputed. The
Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled entirely
in the school's favor.
   Jeffrey Trachtman, of the New York law firm of Kramer,
Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel, which represented the school,
said that if judges got involved in the grading process, "you
would have hundreds of cases flooding the court, with judges
called upon to grade papers."
   Deans of nine other law schools had filed
friend-of-the-court briefs supporting New York Law School's
position. Dean David Trager, of Brooklyn Law School, said
that schools have "an interest in policing questions of
grading," but that courts should not be involved.
   Thomas F. Keane, who represented the former student, said
he was dissappointed by the ruling. "The bottom line of it is
that the Court of Appeals is saying that they don't have time
for students," he said.

   A DISPUTE IS BREWING over microwave coffeemakers.
   U.S. District Judge James L. Latchum of Delaware denied a
request by Farberware Inc. to bar Mr. Coffee Inc. from
filling orders for its new microwave coffeemaker, Quick Brew.
   Farberware has alleged in a suit that the overall
appearance and design of Quick Brew is substantially similar
to its MicroBrew microwave coffeemaker and would cause
confusion among consumers. Mr. Coffee began shipping Quick
Brew to retailers last month.
   The microwave coffee market is expected to be increasingly
significant. According to the judge's opinion, 50% of all
Americans drink coffee and 80% of U.S. households contain
microwave ovens.
   Judge Latchum wrote that the two coffeemakers "simply do
not look alike," and that differences in labeling and
packaging made consumer confusion unlikely. A lawyer for
Farberware said the company intends to proceed with the case.
