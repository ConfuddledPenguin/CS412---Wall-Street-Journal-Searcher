   Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., one of Japan's largest shipping
companies, is in negotiations to purchase Wassing
Internationale BV, a major Dutch distributing company, a
Mitsui official said this week.
   Mitsui seeks to buy 100% of the company, the official
said, although the purchase price hasn't been disclosed.

   Wassing's business operations in the U.S., Europe and Far
East, including air cargo transport, trucking and inland
cargo transport and warehousing, will be left intact.
   Mitsui is pursuing the deal because it aims to gain a
foothold in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, which handles a
large amount of European shipping. The move is part of a
strategy to expand in Europe, the official noted.
