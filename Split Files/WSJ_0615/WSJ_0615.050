   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- In June 1988, the bookkeeper at Blan
Stewart's insurance agency here received a horrible phone
call: Mr. Stewart had been killed in a plane crash. Imagine
her surprise when Mr. Stewart walked in the door.
   And consider how she felt five months later, when she
heard that Mr. Stewart, then 45 years old, really had died in
a plane crash this time. But this was on a rainy Halloween
night. And both the wreck and the body were nowhere to be
found. No one would have blamed the bookkeeper if she'd
figured that Mr. Stewart would walk in again.

   In fact, Mr. Stewart does reside in the realm of the
undead. A judge recently refused to declare him dead, but no
one can say for sure that he's alive.
   Confused? So are the people of Alabama, who have been
closely following the bizarre case of Douglas Blan Stewart
Jr. It's a mystery with everything: money, power, greed --
even piqued twins.
   Everyone is taking sides. There's the wife -- or widow --
and her family, a pillar of the city's elite. Sarah Lanier
Stewart stands to gain almost $4 million in insurance if Mr.
Stewart's body really lies at the bottom of spider-shaped
Lake Martin. Then there are the insurance companies, which
don't want to pay the claims, and Donald Valeska, a state
prosecutor, who declares, "He ain't in that lake any more
than Gorbachev is."
   "He's still alive," agrees Napolean Woods, locker-room
attendant for 37 years at the Huntsville Country Club, where
Mr. Stewart was a past president and weekly golfer. In a
straw poll taken in the club's cocktail lounge, says the
bartender, "three said he was down, two said he was up."
   Ralph Kenney, who claims to have seen Mr. Stewart's plane
sputtering toward Lake Martin, figures that Mr. Stewart is
100 feet down. The butcher in Dadeville, Ala., near the lake,
points out that it's one of the largest man-made lakes in the
U.S., and still hides the remains of a bomber and its pilot
that crashed during World War II, making it an official
military grave. "That lake's probably full of stuff that
ain't never been found," he says.
   Only one thing is certain: Mr. Stewart had good reason to
disappear.
   The son of a mechanic, Mr. Stewart moved to Huntsville in
the early 1970s with his first wife and their twin boys.
Hungering for money and social status, he bounced around as
an insurance salesman, but managed to move his family into a
string of more expensive homes -- to the amazement of his own
wife, Jinna. "He aspired for things he didn't have and
couldn't afford," she says.
   Loud, chummy and fond of bourbon, Mr. Stewart back-slapped
his way into upper-crust Huntsville. His wife took the twins
and left him in the mid-1970s, but Mr. Stewart soon met Sarah
Lanier, whom he married in 1976. Mr. Stewart boasted to his
former wife that her replacement had everything: beauty,
style and money.
   Old money at that. In 1899, Mrs. Stewart's grandfather
founded what has become Huntsville's oldest and largest law
firm. Since the 1950s, her father, M.H. "Pete" Lanier, has
lorded over both the firm and Huntsville's legal community
with a reputation for toughness. The Laniers are also large
property owners, and are active in civic affairs. Pete
Lanier, everyone says, is a very powerful man.
   For a time, things went well. The couple had a daughter,
and Mr. Stewart took his wife's brother, Frederick, under his
wing in his new insurance agency.
   With their family connections and Mr. Stewart's penchant
for selling, Stewart &amp; Lanier grew into one of the largest
insurance agencies in Alabama, booking policies, at its peak,
worth more than $6 million a year in premiums. Mr. Stewart
sold more business for Travelers Corp. than any other agent
in the state.
   But he also began to buy and spend wildly: airplanes,
Jaguars, lots of travel and a condominium in Florida as well
as office, restaurant and residential property in Huntsville.
"He was living way too high for what he made," says Wade
Russell, a businessman and friend of Mr. Stewart.
   Partner Frederick was getting fed up. And finally, in
1985, after repeatedly accusing Mr. Stewart of using agency
funds on his sumptuous personal life, Mr. Lanier quit the
firm in a huff.
   Before long, Mr. Stewart allegedly turned to fraud to make
ends meet. In August 1988, the Alabama attorney general's
office charged him with stealing nearly $600,000, much of it
client premiums.
   In June 1988, Travelers hauled off Mr. Stewart's records,
essentially putting him out of business. That same day, Jayne
Patterson, the bookkeeper, received a call from Frederick
Lanier, the former partner. The two remember the conversation
differently, but both agree that the upshot was the same: Mr.
Stewart was dead.
   "My father was concerned that we could not find Blan at
any of the airports," he says. "We didn't know where the
plane was." Frederick acknowledges that the mix-up was
"unfortunate," given the actual disappearance five months
later.
   An hour or so after Frederick's call, Mr. Stewart walked
into his agency. "I was speechless," says Ms. Patterson.
   By October 1988, Mr. Stewart's buoyant mood had vanished.
Efforts to borrow money from friends were failing. And the
attorney general's office said it wouldn't accept a plea
bargain without jail time.
   Mr. Stewart asked his father-in-law, Pete Lanier, for
help. On Thursday, Oct. 27, Mr. Stewart and his wife met with
Mr. Lanier and told him of their financial troubles for the
first time, according to a deposition by Mr. Lanier. Mr.
Stewart said he needed at least $125,000. But Mr. Lanier
insisted on seeing all of his financial records before
offering any help.
   Two days later, Mr. Stewart flew to Florida for the
weekend to take care of some business and visit his sons at
college. It was the first time he had ever visited without
calling first. He seemed depressed. He slipped out Monday
morning, leaving a note telling the twins he loved them.
   His plane vanished from radar at 5:55 p.m. that night.
   Meanwhile, back in Huntsville, strange things were
happening at the insurance office. Mrs. Stewart tracked down
Ms. Patterson on Sunday -- the day before the plane
disappeared -- and asked to meet her at Mr. Stewart's office.
Mrs. Stewart asked the bookkeeper to pull Mr. Stewart's
financial records, including his personal life-insurance
policies.
   Then Mr. and Mrs. Lanier showed up and, according to a
witness, Pete Lanier sat down and took notes on a yellow
legal pad. In one interview with investigators, Ms. Patterson
recalls Mrs. Stewart telling her, "Blan's not coming home,"
and Mr. Lanier saying that he was a "gone S.O.B."
   Ms. Patterson's recollection has gotten fuzzier since
then. Asked about that, she smiles. "I have to live in this
town," she says. "Mr. Lanier is very powerful."
   Mrs. Stewart and Mr. Lanier insist that family and marital
relations were fine. The only reason the Laniers went to the
agency at all on Sunday was to pick up their granddaughter to
play miniature golf, they said in depositions.
   Mr. Lanier and Mrs. Stewart declined comment for this
story.
   Holly Wiseman, the assistant state attorney general who
had been prosecuting Mr. Stewart, tried to investigate the
apparent crash. But she ran into a buzzsaw in Pete Lanier,
whom she calls "abusive and uncooperative," so she subpoenaed
Mr. Lanier and his daughter to the Madison County grand jury
for questioning under oath.
   No charges were filed. But the state attorney general's
office says it hasn't closed the case. Investigators have
chased a number of leads, including word that Mr. Stewart's
plane is buried under several feet of cement at a central
Alabama housing development. Samples were excavated, but
yielded nothing.
   In the meantime, Mrs. Stewart, 41, asked state court Judge
Jeri Blankenship to certify that her husband is dead. Judge
Blankenship got the case after most judges in the county
bowed out because of ties to the Stewart or Lanier families.
   The request was fought by the underwriters of the life
insurance policies. In an 11-day hearing, they argued that
the only evidence that a crash had even occurred -- the
discovery in Lake Martin of an antenna, a fender and some
landing-gear parts from the missing Piper -- hardly proved
that Mr. Stewart had perished.
   The hearing was the media event of the year in Huntsville.
Banner headlines trumpeted the proceedings on front pages
across the state. The small courtroom was packed each day.
   Last month, the judge refused to rule Blan Stewart dead.
Mrs. Stewart must now wait until at least 1993 to collect any
insurance money, according to state law. She has declared
personal bankruptcy, but still lives in an elegant home.
   After the disappearance, Mrs. Stewart called Mr. Stewart's
first wife and said she loved her stepsons and hoped to
continue helping them financially, says the first wife,
Jinna. Mrs. Stewart also asked if the boys would sign a
petition to the county coroner, asking that their father be
declared dead. The boys signed the request, but the coroner
concluded that he couldn't declare a death without a body.
   Shortly after signing the petition, the twins were told by
Mrs. Stewart and her father to turn in their cars and vacate
their condominium at once, says Douglas Blan Stewart III, or
Trip, one of the sons. Mr. Stewart had given the twins money
and let them use his credit cards, but now they have been cut
off financially, Trip says, and they haven't heard from Mrs.
Stewart or the Laniers in a year.
   Trip, for one, is sure his father is still alive. And he
wonders: If the Laniers are so sure he's dead, why haven't
they held a memorial service for him?
   Mr. Lanier answered that question in his deposition for
the death petition: "My daughter asked whether we should have
one, and I said I just think that we might as well wait.
