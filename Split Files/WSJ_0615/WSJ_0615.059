   LIMA, Peru -- Susana Elesperu de Freitas quit her job as a
geologist hiking through the Pyrenees for a more settled life
-- selling detergent in the Andes.
   Instead of calm, she got chaos.

   The day after the 34-year-old Peruvian became manager of
Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s subsidiary here in September 1988, the
economy hit the skids. By the end of the year, inflation had
soared to 2,000%. Key managers fled. Leftist terrorists
kidnapped or murdered business leaders.
   The P&amp;G subsidiary's sales plunged more than 30%, and the
unit posted a loss. Money became so tight that Mrs. Elesperu
de Freitas stopped returning long-distance phone calls, even
to her bosses at P&amp;G's Cincinnati headquarters. "I told them
they'd have to call us," she says.
   But while many multinational companies pulled out of Peru,
P&amp;G remained. And now, the consumer-products company is
expanding here. "Everybody should be dying to come here,"
says the spirited executive, who is flanked by armed
bodyguards wherever she goes. "You couldn't go to a better
business school."
   Throughout Latin America, P&amp;G is shaking the stranglehold
of government price controls and its own strict U.S. culture.
The Latin American division began as a fledgling detergent
company but now is a $1 billion business that contributes 15%
of P&amp;G's international sales. The company expects the
division, which has subsidiaries in nine countries and sells
in 10 others through distributors, to double its revenue
again in five years. And it says the division's profit
margins exceed its international average. "It's one of our
star performers," says Edwin L. Artzt, P&amp;G's chief executive.
   P&amp;G sees Latin America as central to its global strategy.
The region is rich in raw materials and in young people
hungry for all sorts of consumer products. "A lot of
companies are focusing only on Europe and Asia," says Jorge
Montoya, a P&amp;G vice president. "We're going against the
current, and it's worked."
   The company has long been a player in Latin America. P&amp;G
Mexico was one of its first foreign ventures. In Mexico, P&amp;G
learned an important lesson: U.S. management and marketing
plans often don't work outside the U.S.
   Ace detergent, launched in Mexico in the early 1950s, was
clobbered by local competitors. Developed for U.S. washing
machines, the product had a low-suds formula. But at that
time, many Mexicans washed their clothes in the river or in a
basin of water, and they judged a detergent by its suds.
   "P&amp;G assumed that what was good across the Rio Grande
should be good here as well," says Claude Salomon, general
manager for P&amp;G Mexico.
   Eventually, the formula was changed. Similarly, P&amp;G
switched from cardboard boxes to plastic bags, which kept the
detergent drier and were cheaper. Besides, many consumers
shop every day and can afford only small amounts of detergent
each time. Now, one top seller throughout Latin America is
the 100-gram bag, enough to wash just one basket of clothes.
   Despite its Mexican ties, P&amp;G long considered Latin
America a financial sinkhole. Until 1987, the Latin American
business was run from Cincinnati by U.S.-born managers who
viewed the region as far less glamorous than P&amp;G's
subsidiaries in Europe and the Far East. Mr. Artzt, while
president of the international business, pushed more managers
into the trenches, but even he didn't like to send them to
Latin America.
   However, Mr. Montoya insisted that his Latin American team
move to Caracas. "We either had to pull out {of the region}
or change our attitude," he says. Here is how P&amp;G became a
major force in two tough markets, Peru and Venezuela.
                                                                                                       

   Peru
                                                                                                       

   One word describes Peru: chaos.
   "Politically, it's a mess. Economically, it's even more of
a mess," says Patrick Egan, who heads Unilever's Latin
American operations. The Anglo-Dutch food and
consumer-products giant sold its Peruvian operations in the
early 1970s, and, Mr. Egan says, "Nothing has happened to
entice us to go back."
   So why did P&amp;G stay?
   "Exiting a country isn't something we're likely to do,"
Mr. Artzt says. P&amp;G has been thrown out of places such as
Iran, Iraq and Cuba but chose to leave only one, Chile, when
the violence escalated in 1963. P&amp;G sold its Chilean business
to Unilever, and regrets it. "We would be better off today if
we hadn't left," Mr. Artzt says. P&amp;G returned to Chile in
1983 through acquisition of a personal-care-products company
but hasn't overtaken Unilever as the dominant player.
   Opportunities multiplied in Peru only in the past decade,
since the collapse of a military regime that had forced
foreign businesses to yield control to local workers. In
recent years, a consumption boom lifted P&amp;G detergent sales
sharply.
   But inflation also soared. The economy became a house of
cards held up with subsidies, price controls and tiered
exchange rates. So, in a late-1988 program to restore order,
the government devalued the inti from 33 to the dollar to
250.
   "We were in trouble," Mrs. Elesperu de Freitas says. The
first problem was to preserve P&amp;G's business, which was
"disappearing," she adds. She cut all nonessential expenses.
Use of the copier and telephones was limited. Business
lunches and magazine subscriptions were out.
   One thing she couldn't afford to cut was the quality of
the product. Despite the lean times, P&amp;G research showed that
many Peruvians still wanted a premium brand.
   In Lima's Miraflores section, Marisabel Alzamore is doing
her daily wash. She lives in one of the adobe houses grouped
around a courtyard, where water trickles from one spigot into
a stone sink shared by more than two dozen tenants. For her
and the other women, doing the laundry is a social event, a
time to discuss children and husbands and detergents.
   Ms. Alzamore is using P&amp;G's Ace Lemon. Elbow-deep in thick
suds, she scrubs a cream-colored jacket. Ms. Alzamore, who
doesn't know that some of her visitors work for P&amp;G,
complains about the rising price of detergent, which she buys
in 225-gram bags. But she hasn't switched to an economy
brand, she says, because she likes Ace's whitening power.
Instead, she uses her wash water several times.
   "Here a family evaluates a woman by how the clothes look,"
says Patricia Foster, a P&amp;G consumer researcher. "It's a very
chauvinistic culture."
   P&amp;G, in addition to maintaining product quality, courts
the wholesale and retail trade. To keep pace with Peru's
rapid inflation, the company raises detergent prices 20% to
30% every two weeks. As a result, some small shops have
reduced their orders. To keep them supplied, P&amp;G hired a
fleet of delivery people in Volkswagen vans to deliver their
orders, sometimes for only a dozen tubes of toothpaste.
   At larger wholesalers, salesmen such as Carlos Linan spend
more time discussing pricing than pushing for higher volume.
Mr. Linan, a 20-year P&amp;G veteran, works Lima's toughest
neighborhood, La Parada. "Even the thieves know him here,"
says the sales manager, Jorge Brake.
   In La Parada, row after row of vendors offer everything
from aspirin to auto parts. Today, the price of Ace has risen
another 20%, but Modesto Limachi still buys his usual order
of 320 cases of various P&amp;G detergents -- "my best sellers,"
he says.
   One service P&amp;G no longer provides is 60-day free credit.
Now credit runs only 15 to 30 days, with its cost split
between the retailers and P&amp;G.
   Despite the turmoil in Peru, P&amp;G has widened its product
line. It now sells 15 brands of toothpaste, detergent, soap
and health-care products in the country. Crest toothpaste,
recently expanded to include Crest for Kids, ranks No. 2 in
the market, after Kolynos, an American Home Products brand
sold through a licensee.
   "Even in the middle of hyperinflation, initiatives will
make our business grow," Mrs. Elesperu de Freitas says. Her
subsidiary expects fiscal 1990 sales and profit to rise 5%
from a year earlier. And it plans to unveil new products,
which it won't describe, within a few weeks.
   The company tries hard to retain employees who might be
tempted to flee Peru. It adjusts salaries every month to keep
up with inflation and hires plenty of security guards. Mrs.
Elesperu de Freitas, the daughter of a Lima cotton broker,
says she doesn't fret about the risks of her job but now is a
bit more cautious. "Personally, I could face a country in the
midst of war and be prepared," she says calmly.
                                                                                                       

   Venezuela
                                                                                                       

   Ask Raphael Henao about the past few years in Venezuela,
and the Colombian-born, Stanford-educated manager says, in
loose translation: "When the waters are rough, the good
fishermen get the best fish. When it's quiet, anyone can
fish."
   P&amp;G hit rough waters in the early 1980s, when Venezuela
was rocked by economic shocks set off by its rising debt and
falling oil prices. The bolivar was devalued. The economy
slumped. P&amp;G's Venezuelan unit reported a loss for 1983.
   But the most vexing problem was Venezuela's strict price
controls. Despite surging raw-material costs, P&amp;G and other
manufacturers got few price increases. "Typically, we'd get
half of what we asked for, about five months later," he said.
By 1988, detergent prices in Venezuela were less than half
the U.S. levels.
   Government controls did their worst damage in late 1988.
P&amp;G suppliers couldn't deliver phosphates, which are still
used in detergents here; phosphate demand was high, and the
buyers had exhausted their import quotas under
foreign-exchange regulations. P&amp;G ads in newspapers told
customers that its plant would close until phosphate
shipments resumed.
   The ad sparked panic buying, and a local judge ordered Mr.
Henao arrested. Some people suspected P&amp;G of hoarding
inventory in hopes of raising detergent prices. Mr. Henao
fled to Colombia while P&amp;G attorneys fought the charges,
which eventually were dropped. "It was kind of nasty," Mr.
Henao says.
   At times, the government has also competed with P&amp;G. In
the late 1970s, the government itself imported Pampers
disposable diapers, one of P&amp;G's main products, and locked up
half the disposable-diaper market. The P&amp;G subsidiary also
imported Pampers and sold them to retailers and wholesalers
not supplied by the government. When the bolivar was
devalued, the subsidiary suffered because the government got
a preferential exchange rate and cheaper transportation. So
Pampers got beat by Pampers, and for a while all imports of
P&amp;G diapers were halted.
   The company didn't return to the diaper business until it
formed a joint venture with a local competitor, Industrias
Mammi, in 1988. The Mammi brand holds the biggest share in a
growing market. Even in poor countries, mothers who work
outside the home rely increasingly on disposable diapers.
   While taking care of her three grandchildren, Isabel Osuna
changes about 18 diapers a day, and the 52-year-old
grandmother rules out cloth diapers -- she says 18 are too
many to wash. So, 15 bags of Mammi diapers are stacked in the
tiny hallway of the three-bedroom apartment that she shares
with 10 relatives.
   "They may not have enough to eat, but they will have their
disposable diapers," says Eva de Mizrahi, a P&amp;G researcher.
   Studies of Venezuelan consumers indicate that they prize
value above all else. But because the country's per capita
income is only $1,370 a year, P&amp;G has introduced several new
products to help consumers stretch their budgets. One was
Moncler soap, after Venezuelans complained that a bar of soap
doesn't last long enough. Moncler's kidney shape keeps the
center of the bar from standing in water on a flat surface
and turning soft. And despite its usual avoidance of
low-priced brands, P&amp;G also has introduced an economy
detergent, Rindex, which sells for about 30% to 40% less than
the market leaders.
   Keeping track of this market's changing demands is tricky
-- and sometimes dangerous. Traveling through the interior is
tough. So is driving in Caracas; salespeople lose at least
one car a month in its demolition derby. And getting
consumers to talk requires patience. In the U.S., test
markets, mass surveys and focus groups are common, but in
Venezuela, research is done one home at a time.
   In the Barrio Zamora, P&amp;G market researchers visit Maria
Moreno as she scrubs her clothes in a yellow plastic basin.
Overhead, the afternoon sun streams through a hole in the tin
roof. The mother of three uses Las Llaves, a locally made
laundry bar, because it whitens and softens her clothes. She
also uses it to brush her teeth and scrub the concrete floors
of the three-room clay ranchito where she lives with another
family. When her son cuts himself, her doctor told her, the
laundry bar is good for cleaning the wound.
   She isn't likely to switch brands, the P&amp;G team figures.
"She thinks there's something magical about this bar," Ms.
Mizrahi comments. But there is hope for the P&amp;G people: In
the kitchen, they spot a box of Rindex, recently bought by
another tenant.
