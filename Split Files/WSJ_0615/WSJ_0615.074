   BLUE BELL, Pa. -- U.S. Healthcare Inc. expects per-share
earnings for the second quarter to be "better than 25 cents,"
Leonard Abramson, president, said.
   The executive's forecast, which is on the high side of the
range of analysts' estimates, indicates net income of at
least $11.8 million, based on the company's 47.3 million
shares outstanding in the first quarter.

   A year earlier, U.S. Healthcare, an operator of health
maintenance organizations, earned $6.6 million, or 14 cents a
share, on revenue of $242 million.
   Mr. Abramson, in an interview, also forecast that U.S.
Healthcare will have record operating earnings and revenue in
1990, as analysts expect. The company's record for earnings
dates to 1986, when operating profit was $35.8 million, or 70
cents a share. A gain on the sale of the company's interest
in a joint venture that year made net $75.8 million, or $1.48
a share.
   The company's record for annual revenue, posted in 1989,
is $1 billion.
   Mr. Abramson said U.S. Healthcare, whose HMOs are in
Middle Atlantic and New England states, is continuing its
push into the New York area. In the past 30 days, he said,
the company added four new division managers and 37 sales
people to its expansion efforts in the New York market,
including northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut, as
well as New York City.
   The company currently has about 250,000 HMO members in the
New York market, or just under one quarter of its total
membership. Mr. Abramson said he expects membership in that
market to reach one million "in the foreseeable future." He
declined to be more specific.
   U.S. Healthcare is studying a possible move into the
Baltimore and Richmond, Va., markets. It is also "looking at
the {Washington}, D.C., marketplace," though that effort is
less far along, he said.
   Mr. Abramson noted that the vast majority of U.S.
Healthcare's contracts now generally provide for flat per
diem payments, in contrast to payments for individual items,
such as the patient's room, use of the operating room and
radiological services. He added that the company is trying to
negotiate longer contracts with hospitals, to cut down on the
administrative time given to contract renewals.
   In contrast to the one-year contracts that used to be the
norm, he said, the company's contracts now average about
three years, and some stretch out for five years, though they
include "out clauses" for both parties. He said the company
is talking with a Philadelphia hospital about a 10-year
contract. "I'm going to try to move to 20-year contracts," he
said.
   Mr. Abramson said he expects U.S. Healthcare's new
quality-assurance subsidiary, U.S. Quality Algorithms Corp.,
to be up and running within nine months. The subsidiary, also
known as USQA, was formed in April with the appointment as
president of Steven L. Zatz, who expects its staff of doctors
and statisticians to grow to between 10 and 15 people by year
end. "We're going to be a model for other people to follow,"
Mr. Abramson predicted.
   He said the subsidiary initially will provide "a
statistical report card of hospitals and physicians and
laboratories that we use" at the parent company. But later,
he said, USQA will market its data analysis to corporate and
governmental buyers of health care, to insurers and to
health-care providers.
   USQA has begun to study practice patterns of the medical
specialists that U.S. Healthcare contracts with, much as the
parent has already studied those of primary-care physicians.
All the doctors in the U.S. Healthcare network are
independent practitioners.
   The first USQA study has been limited to obstetricians and
gynecologists. It looks at such strictly financial criteria
as billing practices but also at factors related to
appropriateness and thus quality, such as Caesarian section
rates. Eventually this information will help to determine
whether the company will continue contracting with the
doctors.
   About this preliminary evaluation of the specialists, Mr.
Abramson remarked, "We were surprised. Some we thought were
so good weren't so good."
