   CPC International Inc. signed a consent agreement with the
Federal Trade Commission under which the company agreed not
to run allegedly misleading advertisements that imply its
Mazola corn-oil products can lower cholesterol.
   The FTC charged CPC with "making false, misleading and
unsubstantiated advertising claims" about the effect of
Mazola products on serum cholesterol levels.

   In signing the agreement -- and similar agreements with
the attorneys general of 10 states -- CPC, based in Englewood
Cliffs, N.J., didn't admit it violated any law. But it agreed
not to make certain statements in future ads, and it agreed
to pay a total of $100,000 in legal costs to the states.
   The FTC's complaint cited, among others, a print ad
showing a fried chicken leg with the headline "Add Mazola,
reduce cholesterol." The text of the ad went on to say, among
other things: "Not only are Mazola products cholesterol-free,
but Mazola corn oil and margarine also help reduce your
existing serum cholesterol level. Yes, reduce your
cholesterol."
   The FTC charged that, without other dietary changes, CPC
"does not have a reasonable basis for that claim."
   Bob Gillespie, president of CPC's Best Foods unit, said
yesterday that "in hindsight, that wasn't a good ad for us to
run." He said that ad and the others in question have since
been pulled. Current TV ads for Mazola, Mr. Gillespie said,
pitch that Mazola "as part of a prudent balanced diet and
exercise program can in fact contribute to lowering
cholesterol."
   "We've got a good, solid defensive case supported by
clinical research" that Mazola can help lower cholesterol as
part of a balanced diet, Mr. Gillespie said.
   The crackdown on CPC follows by just a couple of months a
similar offensive directed by the same group of attorneys
general against RJR Nabisco's Nabisco Brands unit, which
agreed to stop running ads for its Fleischmann's corn-oil
margarine and other products. Like CPC, Nabisco didn't admit
any wrongdoing, but pledged not to run the contested ads.
   "I hope the business sector understands that we're in this
for the long haul," said Hubert H. Humphrey III, the attorney
general of Minnesota, one of the states in the agreement.
"This ought to send a very strong message that misleading and
false advertising will not be tolerated."
