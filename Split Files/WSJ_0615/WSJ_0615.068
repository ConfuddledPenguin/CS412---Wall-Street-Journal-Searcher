   NEW YORK -- John A. Mulheren Jr. admitted that he agreed
to pay Ivan F. Boesky's company $790,000 even though he had
no legal obligation to make the payments, but contended it
wasn't part of any illicit arrangement.
   Ending two days of testimony in his own defense, Mr.
Mulheren said he agreed to pay Mr. Boesky the money by
inflating brokerage bills that Mr. Mulheren's former company,
Jamie Securities Co., paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company in
late 1985. Mr. Mulheren said he agreed to give Mr. Boesky's
company, Seemala Corp., the money "only because they beat me
up and harassed me over the telephone." He was referring to
Mr. Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator, and
Michael Davidoff, a key aide to Mr. Boesky.

   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. The
government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren conducted numerous
illegal securities trades with Mr. Boesky's company, and that
Mr. Mulheren proposed a bogus scheme to compensate Mr. Boesky
for profits on those trades. The scheme allegedly called for
inflating Jamie's brokerage fees to Mr. Boesky's trading
company in late 1985.
   But Mr. Mulheren said he agreed to pay Mr. Boesky's firm
the money because Mr. Boesky had often done him "favors." He
said, "I increased the bills" to Seemala "to get them back a
favor," because Mr. Boesky had sold him stocks that made Mr.
Mulheren's firm a lot of money. Mr. Mulheren, who ran a
limited partnership, said he didn't tell any of his investors
that he was paying the $790,000 to Mr. Boesky. Mr. Mulheren
said he often inflated brokerage bills paid to others who had
also done him favors. "I've been marking up bills for years,"
he said.
   Clad in blue jeans and a turquoise sport shirt, Mr.
Mulheren was often smug and surly when responding to
questions put to him by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alfred
Pavlis, a prosecutor in the case. "You're a very wealthy man,
aren't you, Mulheren?" Mr. Pavlis asked. "No, the lawyers are
now," Mr. Mulheren quipped.
   "Isn't it true that you invited Ivan Boesky to your
wedding anniversary" in the late 1970s? Mr. Pavlis asked.
"Which one, there was one every year," Mr. Mulheren
responded.
   Mr. Boesky's cooperation with the government led to a
sweeping insider-trading investigation and to the
government's case against the 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren. In
earlier testimony, Mr. Mulheren had tried to distance himself
from Mr. Boesky, painting Mr. Boesky as only a casual
acquaintance.
   But yesterday, under cross-examination, Mr. Mulheren
acknowledged that he twice told the Securities and Exchange
Commission under oath that he spoke to Mr. Boesky "twenty
times a day, every day of the year." Mr. Mulheren called his
prior testimony "a gross exaggeration," but added, "It's not
a lie."
   Mr. Mulheren said Mr. Boesky had shared "sensitive and
confidential" information with him. He also acknowledged that
he had once hosted a charity dinner on Mr. Boesky's behalf,
and that Mr. Boesky had given a donation to Mr. Mulheren's
alma mater, Roanoke College, in Mr. Mulheren's name.
   Three government witnesses, including Mr. Boesky, have
previously testified that Mr. Mulheren conducted a series of
trades that were designed to generate tax losses for Mr.
Boesky's trading firm and to help Mr. Boesky evade net
capital requirements. But under intense questioning by Mr.
Pavlis, Mr. Mulheren insisted he never did anything illegal
and never understood that profits and losses from the trades
were to be borne by Mr. Boesky's company, as the witnesses
had said.
