   MILAN, Italy -- Electricity consumption in Italy in May
rose 3.7% from a year earlier to 17.02 billion
kilowatt-hours, ENEL, the state electricity utility, said.
   A kilowatt-hour is the amount of electrical energy
consumed when 1,000 watts are used for one hour. ENEL also
said demand for electricity in the first five months of this
year rose 3.4% to more than 99 billion kwh, compared with the
year-earlier period.
