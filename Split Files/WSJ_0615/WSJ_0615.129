   HONG KONG -- The jobless rate in the three months ended
April 30 rose to a seasonally adjusted 1.8%, its highest
level since mid-1988, from 1.5% a year earlier and 1.3% in
the three months ended Jan. 31, according to government data.
   The figures bolster a trend that government officials have
predicted would stem from the colony's economic slowdown that
began in last year's second half. Last month's statistics
showed first-quarter unemployment at 1.7%. The provisional
unemployment rate for the three months ended May 31 indicated
a decline in unemployment to 1.6%.

   Economists are generally hoping for a rising jobless rate,
because it could indicate a slowing in local inflationary
pressure, most of which stems from spiraling wages.
