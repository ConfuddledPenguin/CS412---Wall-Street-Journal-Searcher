   Over-the-counter stocks reversed course and slid in
sympathy with skittish exchange-listed shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.76 to 467.10, a 0.38%
loss, as volume slipped to 155.2 million shares from 163.5
million Wednesday. Declining shares overtook advancers, 1,051
to 828.

   Utility shares gave back Wednesday's gains as MCI
Communications, the largest stock in the group, tumbled 2 to
41 5/8 in affinity with exchange-listed United Telecom, down
3 1/4 to 40 7/8. Shares of the long-distance carriers fell
after analysts at PaineWebber and Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
slightly cut their 1990 second-quarter and full-year
estimates for United Telecom. The Nasdaq Utility Index fell
7.62 to 667.22.
   However, PaineWebber analyst Jack Grubman said in an
interview after the market closed that the market's reaction
to his "minor fine-tuning" of earnings estimates was
"ridiculous." Mr. Grubman explained that he lowered his
expectations slightly for United Telecom because rival
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is stabilizing its market
share in some segments of the residential and general
business markets, although it continues to lose market share
in some other markets. Consequently, he explained, revenue
for United Telecom may be somewhat softer than expected. He
didn't change his estimates for MCI.
   The telecommunications analyst emphasized that he still
has "buy" ratings on all three long-distance carriers. Mr.
Grubman said he told institutional investors during the day
that the long-distance carrier business "is a great industry
still growing at a double digit rate." He attributed the
sharp decline in United Telecom and the fall in MCI to a
nervous stock market.
   Traders at two large New York brokerage firms said they
continue to see buyers come in when OTC stocks fall. "There
were buyers this afternoon and sellers this morning," said
Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds.
When the market does fall, "there's an absence of real
sellers," added Ralph Costanza, who manages OTC trading at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "There are no sellers trying
to unload positions and no panics," he said.
   Vitalink Communications led the percentage losers after
the abrupt resignation yesterday of the company's chief
executive officer, chairman and president, George Archulete.
Vitalink fell 3 1/4 to 9 5/8.
   Donald J. Herman, interim chief executive for the Fremont,
Calif., maker of data communication products, said in an
interview with Dow Jones News Service that Vitalink's
earnings for the third quarter ending this month may fall
below analysts' expectations. Mr. Herman said that the
quarter's earnings may fall below a range of 21 to 28 cents a
share expected by analysts, which compares with year-earlier
profit from continuing operations of 28 cents a share.
   Analysts said the stock's slide reflects slumping product
sales. Resales of Vitalink products under an accord with
Digital Equipment Corp. are lower than in the previous
quarter because the market for the products is changing,
according to Smith Barney analyst Therese M. Murphy.
   Intel, which traded as high as 48 3/4, closed unchanged at
48 after the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker said it
will delay for at least another year the closing of a
fabrication plant in Livermore, Calif., because of strong
demand for its 386 microprocessor. Last July the company
announced plans to close the plant this year.
   Tokos Medical added 1/4 to 15 after the Santa Ana, Calif.,
provider of health-care services said that certain principal
shareholders who own a total of 5.9 million shares of the
company's common stock have agreed not to sell any shares
before Sept. 30. Under a previous agreement related to the
company's $12-a-share initial public offering in March, those
shareholders had been allowed to sell 25% of their stock on
June 25 and an additional 25% at the end of each following
month.
   Fibronics, which rose 1 1/8 Wednesday, climbed 5/8 to 11.
Institutional investors met Tuesday in Boston with the
Hyannis, Mass., designer and maker of fiber-optic and other
high-speed data systems used in computers, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. The number of brokerage
firms following the company has doubled to four in the last
few months.
   Exabyte advanced 3/4 to 22 3/8. Steve Smith, general
counsel and investor relations contact for the Boulder,
Colo., concern, told DJPIR that Pacific Growth Equity Inc., a
San Francisco broker-dealer, issued a report on Exabyte
Wednesday and began making a market in its shares. Exabyte,
which makes high-capacity cartridge tape storage subsystems
for computers, went public last October at $10 a share.
   Mr. Smith said he is comfortable with analysts' estimates
that the company will earn about 34 cents a share in the
second quarter ending June 30, compared with 13 cents a share
on a pro forma basis in the year-earlier quarter.
   American Capital &amp; Research jumped 1 to 12 3/4 in heavy
trading after the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
said Wednesday that it awarded a $119.4 million contract to a
unit of the Fairfax, Va., environmental consulting services
concern.
   Players International tumbled 1 1/8 to 5 1/4 following a
report that U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) plans to ask
Congress to investigate 900-number telephone games, DJPIR
reported. Players recently began test marketing its
900-number telephone version of the syndicated television
game show "Jeopardy." Wednesday, the stock fell 1 3/16 to 6
3/8 after a report of the congressman's concerns appeared in
a New York newspaper.
   Mass Microsystems extended its slide. The Sunnyvale,
Calif., maker of computer peripheral enhancement technology
said yesterday that it expects net income for the second
quarter ending June 30 to be two cents a share, down from
five cents a year earlier. Mass Microsystems, which lost 5/8
Wednesday, fell 1/2 to 4 1/2.
