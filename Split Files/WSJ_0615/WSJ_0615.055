   ROME -- Italy's industrial producer price index in April
rose 0.1% from March and was up 4% from a year earlier,

   The April increase followed a monthly increase of 0.1% in
March, when the yearto-year increase stood at 4.4%.

   The wholesale price index rose 0.2% in April, compared
with March, and increased 4.4% from a year earlier. This
followed the March index that was flat with February's,
though the year-to-year rate in March was up 5.3%.
   Both the producer price index and the wholesale price
index confirm a downward trend in inflation in recent months.
Consumer price inflation fell to 5.7% in May from 5.8% in
April.
