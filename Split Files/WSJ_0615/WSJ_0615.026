   BRUSSELS -- The European Community put forward proposals
on how to reduce farm subsidies world-wide, but the proposals
weren't expected to end the deadlock in international talks
on agriculture.
   A spokesman for the EC Commission said the proposals were
presented in a working paper to a 32-nation meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, on agriculture negotiations within the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Other participants,
including the U.S., also presented papers at a session
Wednesday.

   While the spokesman called the EC proposals "a step
forward," other people involved in the trade discussions
expressed doubts. They said the EC paper developed some ideas
put forward earlier in the year but broke little or no new
ground.
   For example, the paper reiterated in some detail the
12-nation EC's argument that there should be a "rebalancing"
of import tariffs on agricultural goods so that cuts in
tariffs on some products could be accompanied by increases
elsewhere. The EC contends that as long as the "global" level
of subsidies is reduced, some increases should be allowed.
   This approach has been flatly rejected by the U.S. and
other countries, such as Australia, that insist the talks
shouldn't lead to any tariff increases at all. Washington has
been emphatic on this point because EC moves to increase
tariffs would affect U.S. exports of oilseeds and cereal
substitutes, which currently enter the EC with little or no
import duty charged.
   The EC paper also spelled out in more detail the EC's
response to a U.S. proposal for all agricultural protection
programs to be converted into tariffs. The community has said
it would be willing to accept such a development as long as
the tariffs included a "corrective" mechanism to take into
account factors such as fluctuations in world commodity
prices.
   People from outside the EC said the paper confirmed their
expectations that the new system proposed by Brussels would
be similar to the variable levy that currently protects EC
farmers from the impact of lower world prices. "It looks like
the variable levy by another name," one person said.
   The EC has come under strong pressure in the GATT talks to
dismantle its complex and expensive agricultural support
system, known as the Common Agricultural Policy. But EC
negotiators are hampered by their mandate from EC
governments, which specifically states that the principles of
that policy mustn't be violated.
   The U.S., Australia and some Scandinavian nations put
forward papers spelling out agricultural support programs
that they said shouldn't be subject to cuts. These are aimed
at setting strict criteria to ensure that government aid to
farmers doesn't distort trade.
