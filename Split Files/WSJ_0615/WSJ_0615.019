   Norwalk, Calif. -- David Johnson had just completed the
first day of the two-day decathlon at the USA/Mobil Track &amp;
Field Championships on a California-perfect Tuesday evening
31 points ahead of his national-record pace, but his
happiness was not complete.
   Surveying the remnants of a crowd of, maybe, 200 people
that had watched the day's five events at Cerritos College
stadium, he observed that more public attention to his
endeavor would be nice.

   "Better promotion wouldn't have hurt," said the
broad-shouldered Montanan, the defending champ. "The
publicity gave the meet's dates as June 14-16. Today is June
12. Does that mean we're not here?"
   U.S. decathletes, those one-man bands of track and field,
have been complaining thusly for some years, partly because
foreigners have dominated the form since Bruce Jenner rode
his 1976 Olympic victory to screen, sportswear and
Wheaties-box stardom, and we Yanks tend to ignore things
athletic that we don't win.
   But off the results of the competition that ended in cool,
breezy weather here on Wednesday night before a gathering
even smaller than Tuesday's, this could change. Two fellas,
27-year-old Johnson and Dan O'Brien, a springy, 23-year-old
U. of Idaho dropout, topped the 8,400-point mark over 10
events on the activity's complex points-for-performance
scales, something that never happened before in this land.
   Johnson's 8,600 was best, and it would have been an
American record under recently set standards to allow for
revised javelin specifications if a couple of its components
weren't wind-aided. The score topped the 8,488 points that
won Christian Schenk of East Germany the 1988 Olympic gold
medal, and was the best anywhere for the intervening two
years.
   O'Brien collected 8,483 points, and his performance was
even more noteworthy on a number of grounds. This was his
first national meet, and only the eighth decathlon he'd
completed. Unlike most of the elite field of 17, he had no
major U.S. or collegiate titles in his gym bag.
   He was, moreover, a spotty collegiate performer, due to
injuries, alcohol and drug problems, and, relatedly, an
academic record than left him mostly ineligible for sports.
"Let's just say I was more interested in partying than
studying," says the engaging young man, whose father was
black and mother Finnish, and who was adopted by a Klamath
Falls, Ore., couple named O'Brien at age two.
   But the 6-foot-3, 185-pounder was a multiple-event state
high school track champ in Oregon, and finally got his
decathlon act together in April by scoring 8,267 points at an
invitational meet at Washington State University. That was
the ninth-best score for any American, ever.
   "He has the skills to be a great decathlete, and he's got
the perfect temperament, too. By that I mean he can shrug off
a bad performance and be right back on track a few minutes
later," says Mike Keller, his coach at Idaho. "Dan has lacked
maturity and focus in the past, but he's developing them, and
he's very coachable. If you lead him, he'll quickly run ahead
of you. He picks things up so fast it's scary."
   It's perhaps a coincidence, but Johnson also was no Boy
Scout as a youth, having spent his early high school years in
Missoula, Mont., perpetrating various kinds of mischief. "I
developed my arm throwing rocks at cars, and got my legs in
shape running from the cops," he wryly recalls. Then he moved
to Corvallis in track-crazy Oregon and simultaneously
discovered religion and track and field. They got him through
Azusa Pacific U. and national decathlon titles in 1986 and
'89.
   Despite some ups and downs caused by the injuries that are
inescapable in the grueling discipline (1968 Olympic champ
Bill Toomey once said that behind every successful decathlete
is a good physician), Johnson has been the U.S.'s best in the
event for most of the past five years, and his U.S. record of
8,549 points at the '89 nationals signaled his arrival as an
international force.
   In this competition, though, the vet found himself chasing
the newcomer -- and almost not catching him. O'Brien not only
led the field mathematically through the first day, but also
won four of the five events outright. He ran the 100-meter
dash in 10.4 seconds; long-jumped 26 feet, 4 1/2 inches; put
the shot 50-4 3/4 and high-jumped 6-11 3/4. His long-jump
mark was a world's decathlon best, surprising, he admitted,
even him.
   If O'Brien hadn't sagged a bit in the 400-meter run, the
day's last go, he'd have also set a world's first-day points
record. As it was, his 4,656 was a U.S. mark, led Johnson by
297, and trailed by just 21 the score England's mighty Daley
Thompson posted when he set the world mark of 8,847 at the
1984 Olympics.
   The brawnier Johnson conceded he was impressed, but
pointed toward the morrow, where his strengths in the pole
vault and javelin lay. "I hadn't seen him do his things
before, but he hasn't seen me do mine," he allowed.
   And, verily, that was what came to pass. Johnson
outvaulted O'Brien, 16-4 3/4 to 14-1 1/4, and his javelin
heave of 222-5 was almost 35 feet longer, moving him into
first. O'Brien could have rallied by running the last event
-- the 1,500 meters -- nine seconds faster than Johnson, but
wound up eight seconds slower. While it's remarkable that
anyone could run a mile at all after an 8 1/2-hour day of
dashing and tossing, O'Brien confirmed that his fade bespoke
the need for better conditioning, as well as more time around
the vaulting pit.
   Afterward, champ and challenger faced the press, and waved
the red, white and blue. "Some jaws are gonna drop in Europe
when they see these scores," said Johnson as O'Brien nodded.
"This shows that the decathlon is back in the U.S."
   And when O'Brien predicted he'd improve, Johnson said that
he'd better. "I hope he beats me in '92 at Barcelona, because
if he does it'll mean he's topped 9,000 points," he smiled.
