   GOTHENBURG, Sweden -- The European Free Trade
Association's six member countries have been celebrating the
organization's 30th anniversary here all this week. But it
could be EFTA's last big bash.
   Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland
-- bound together only by non-membership in the European
Community -- are facing a mid-life identity crisis. The
birthday festivities, launched Monday and lasting through
today, have sought to portray EFTA as a vital and flourishing
group. But the ministers and other officials attending will
have to face a painful morning-after reality: As Europe's
walls come down, EFTA is more isolated than ever.

   On one side is a dynamic European Community, moving
forward with its plans for a single market, a single currency
and a closer-knit political system. On the other is a
fast-changing Eastern Europe moving boldly toward the West
and the EC. EFTA's worries about its members' sovereignty and
neutrality seem increasingly anachronistic and irrelevant.
   All of this was supposed to be different. EFTA and the EC
have embarked on a plan for a vast 18-nation market, known as
the European Economic Space, that was to have given EFTA a
new lease on life -- closer, but still separate, from the EC.
But despite some progress in the EES negotiations, many
officials close to the talks say the plan looks unlikely to
produce the kind of boost the EFTA countries need. Meanwhile,
each EFTA country is facing increasing calls from its
businessmen and political leaders to seek full EC membership.
   It was precisely this development that the EC was trying
to avoid. Hoping to give EFTA better access to the EC's
post-1992 market while keeping the mostly-neutral countries
from seeking membership, Commission President Jacques Delors
suggested that the EC and EFTA link their countries into the
EES.
   Though the EES negotiations probably will advance later
this month, their prospects remain cloudy. The EC appears
unwilling to give EFTA much direct say over decision-making
inside the EES. EFTA, for its part, is divided internally,
with one of its members, Austria, already asking for EC
membership. Several others are moving quickly in that
direction.
   The aim of the EES talks is to have a final agreement in
place by Dec. 31, 1992, to correspond with the EC's single
market.
   What EFTA wants is access to the EC market, plus some say
in the creation of laws and regulations that will affect both
its members and the EC. Everything from toy safety, to
electrical standards to the testing of drugs will come under
the EES umbrella. EFTA countries can't be seen as giving all
decision-making powers to EC ministers in areas of such
far-reaching importance.
   Part of the problem lies within the EC. Not everyone in
the EC policy-making process shares President Delors'
enthusiasm for the EES. The European Parliament, in
particular, worries that EFTA countries may end up having
more influence on EC decision-making than do the members of
Parliament themselves.
   Though EFTA ministers probably wouldn't be given seats on
the EC's council of ministers, both sides agree that EFTA
must have some mechanism for making its point of view known
before the ministers make final decisions. One key focus of
the negotiations will be just how direct is such influence
and exactly how it will operate.
   The EES negotiations also must sort out hundreds of cases
where national legislation in EFTA countries conflict with
the EC's own rules -- the so-called acquis communautaire.
Some of the conflicts -- such as the total ban on asbestos
use in Sweden and Norway -- probably will be averted by
granting exemptions from the EC statutes. In many cases, the
EFTA countries may be allowed transitional periods to bring
their laws into compliance.
   A brief look at some of the key countries shows the
difficulties the EES faces:
                                                                                                       

   FINLAND: The revolution in East Europe has opened new
options for Finland, a country with close ties to the East
Bloc and Soviet Union. "A lot has changed in the U.S.S.R. and
Finland as well," says a senior spokesman for the
conservative Kokoomus Party, the biggest member of the ruling
five-party coalition.
   "Changing relations between the superpowers have sparked a
reassessment of our neutrality that is still at an early
stage."
   Finnish corporations are a driving force behind the
political reassessment. "The business community recognized
that the 1992 process would be very important and began
taking steps into Europe several years ago. It took the
politicians a lot longer to catch on," says Katarina
Koivumaa, a Soviet trade specialist at the Finnish Institute
of Foreign Affairs, a Helsinki think tank.
                                                                                                       

   NORWAY: As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Norway hasn't any qualms about neutrality.
Norway's Social Democrats advocated membership in a 1971
referendum, but the government lost that vote and was ousted
from office. It was a stunning setback that kept the subject
of EC membership taboo for years among politicians in Oslo.
   The question of EC membership remains prickly for
Conservative Premier Jan Syse -- mainly because two centrist
parties in his minority coalition government oppose joining
the EC. The Conservatives favor membership but Mr. Syse has
had to maintain a delicate balance to keep his cabinet
intact.
   Last month, the Social Democrats' leader and former prime
minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, took what many pundits view
as a decisive step toward open support of EC membership. In a
speech to the Storting, or parliament, Mrs. Brundtland warned
that if an EES accord doesn't include a satisfactory
decision-making mechanism, Norway would be better off to
withdraw and apply for EC membership instead.
                                                                                                       

   SWEDEN: Social Democrat Premier Ingvar Carlsson caused a
political storm recently by insisting that EC moves toward
political union make membership even more incompatible with
Swedish neutrality.
   But his move backfired. Rival politicians argued that
Sweden's neutrality isn't defined in the constitution or
other treaty -- and charged that Mr. Carlsson was attempting
to use the neutrality argument to quell deep divisions over
EC policy within the Social Democratic party.
   Industrial leaders are pressing for Sweden to follow
Austria's example and declare its intention to seek full EC
membership. This week, Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg
called for Sweden to apply for membership as early as 1993 --
a timetable endorsed by the conservative Moderates, Sweden's
biggest opposition party.
                                                                                                       

   SWITZERLAND: Though Swiss neutrality is among the most
ingrained of any EFTA member, moves are afoot to convince
Swiss citizens that EC membership would be better than their
current status. More and more, Swiss consumers are interested
in a better deal than in preserving the country's sovereignty
and neutrality through economic protectionism.
