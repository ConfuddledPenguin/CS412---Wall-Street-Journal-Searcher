   WASHINGTON -- Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the
U.S. is caught in a serious credit crunch that extends well
beyond the real estate industry and appears to be worsening.
   "It is serious, and it appears to be exacerbating," he
said in an interview. "It's not just real estate people. Real
estate is very serious. But it also has to do with small and
middle-sized businesses, high-tech, across the board,
{businesses} who are trying to get loans and can't."

   Mr. Mosbacher's statements were the strongest yet from a
top administration official on the nation's credit squeeze.
Treasury and Federal Reserve Board officials have attempted
to play down the problem, arguing it is largely limited to
the real estate industry and to certain regions of the
country.
   The commerce secretary also called on the Federal Reserve
to bring down interest rates. "I feel it {monetary policy} is
on the tight side, frankly," he said. "I think it would be a
good time to move towards easing. {Fed Chairman} Alan
Greenspan has done a good job overall, but frankly,
inflationary pressures have cooled, and the slow growth we're
experiencing, along with this credit crunch, is a good reason
to ease."
   In a speech on the Senate floor late last night, New
Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici sternly criticized the Fed for
being too tight, citing his fears that Fed policy is
exacerbating the credit crunch. Noting the slow growth of the
economy and the "ameliorating" inflation outlook, the senior
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee added: "I say to
the Federal Reserve Board: What are you trying to fix? Are
you trying to fix inflation? I don't believe it needs any
fixes right now."
   Mr. Mosbacher spoke briefly about the credit crunch at a
hearing on competitiveness held yesterday by the Senate
Banking Committee and then expanded on his comments in a
telephone interview.
   After a separate hearing at the House Banking Committee,
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp also complained about the squeeze
on credit. "There is a credit crunch," Mr. Kemp said. "No
doubt about it."
   Mr. Mosbacher said there has to be "some serious attention
paid" to the credit problem. But he was circumspect about
placing blame.
   "I'm not saying it's the banks, or the bank examiners or
the Federal Reserve," he said. But he added: "The banks, of
course, have a problem. Privately they will tell you they are
having a hard time with the bank examiners. I don't know
{whether} they will tell you that for quote."
   Mr. Mosbacher disputed the notion that credit problems are
concentrated in certain regions such as New England or Texas.
"It's not regional," he said. "It's pretty much across the
whole country."
   Since early this year, many U.S. companies have complained
of the difficulty of getting banks to approve loans. Banks,
in turn, have blamed tightening standards among regulators in
the wake of widespread failures and scandals in the
savings-and-loan industry.
   Treasury officials continue to argue there is no evidence
of a broad, across-the-board credit crunch. Despite anecdotal
evidence of a credit squeeze, they and Federal Reserve
officials have insisted there are no data showing the problem
to be widespread. Moreover, Treasury officials have avoided
making sweeping public statements on the subject because they
don't want to worsen public concern.
   Mr. Mosbacher, however, dismissed arguments by government
and private economists that the problem isn't widespread. "I
think the economists, when they look at the figures, are
missing it," he said.
   The Senate Banking Committee plans to hold hearings next
week on the credit issue. It has invited Mr. Greenspan as
well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William
Seidman and Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke to
testify.
