   WASHINGTON -- Pete Lunnie of the Fair Employment Coalition
is lobbying vigorously against the civil-rights bill
currently before Congress. His is one of many pro-business
associations that are fighting the bill, which would assist
employees who sue for discrimination.
   But one of the most prestigious companies in the
coalition, International Business Machines Corp., isn't
actively participating in the battle. While "some elements of
the legislation give us cause for concern," says IBM
spokesman Michael Dutton, the company chooses not to lobby
directly against the bill, due for a Senate floor vote later
this month.

   IBM's stance underscores a problem facing opponents of the
civil-rights bill: Put off by the touchiness and complexity
of the legal issues involved, many businesses are sitting
this fight out. And that bolsters the already-strong
prospects for congressional approval this year.
   "There are so many gray areas," concedes Mr. Lunnie, an
intense, thin man who as director of employee relations for
the National Association of Manufacturers has organized many
pro-business coalitions on labor issues. "It's an emotional
issue, no question about it."
   Lobbyists for business associations note that many of the
companies they represent are unwilling to take a public stand
on the civil-rights measure. "None of my companies have been
lobbying the bill," says lobbyist Kathy Mance of the National
Retail Federation. Explains U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyist
Nancy Fulco: "It's incredibly difficult for anybody to take a
stance against a bill with civil rights in its title."
   But supporters of the anti-discrimination bill offer a
different explanation for the muted response by business:
Many companies are not strongly opposed, and some may even
favor it. "I do not believe the business community is
monolithic" on civil rights, says Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which
is spearheading the lobbying effort in favor of the bill.
   In fact, both views appear to be correct: While some
businesses choose to avoid public battle on this issue out of
fear, others are silent because they don't object to the
bill.
   One business spokesman says his company is keeping quiet
because it doesn't want to appear opposed to "motherhood and
the American flag," or insensitive to "the pain and the
suffering that led to the original civil-rights act of the
1960s."
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the San Francisco-based,
investor-owned utility company, submitted favorable testimony
about two of the bill's more controversial sections when the
Senate held hearings last March. "There is little danger that
an absurd or onerous standard will develop" on hiring
practices, personnel officer William Burns told the Labor and
Human Resources Committee.
   Touted by supporters as the most significant civil-rights
measure in more than 20 years, the bill, sponsored by Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D.,
Calif.), was written in response to a series of Supreme Court
decisions in recent years limiting the scope of
employment-discrimination lawsuits. It would tilt the balance
of power back toward plaintiffs in several ways.
   One provision would extend to nonracial minorities and
women the compensatory and punitive damages already available
to those suffering racial discrimination. Another would
require that employers sued for discrimination demonstrate
that hiring requirements bear a "substantial and
demonstrative" relation to the job.
   Lobbyists for business associations say there's nothing
unusual about individual companies keeping a low profile in
congressional battles over labor issues. Asked to provide
this reporter with a list of businesses that belong to his
coalition, Mr. Lunnie said, "I've never been involved in a
coalition where a lot of its membership has been provided to
the press."
   Not every member of Mr. Lunnie's coalition is
publicity-shy about the bill. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., whose chairman, Robert Allen, got interested in the
issue while heading a Business Roundtable task force on
personnel issues, sent an executive to the White House to
argue for changes. AT&amp;T believes "the current bill
overreaches, and it can be corrected in a manner that's fair
to all involved," according to Gerald M. Lowrie, senior vice
president for government affairs.
   This week, Mr. Lunnie arranged for six chief executive
officers, including Chairman Allen Jacobson of Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., to meet with key legislators and
White House staff on the issue. Mr. Lunnie declined to name
most of the individuals and companies involved, but said they
represented businesses of various sizes in the service,
construction, manufacturing, and consumer-products
industries.
   Mr. Lunnie says his group is making a special effort not
to appear "ham-handed" in its lobbying efforts. "The approach
has to be as delicate as the subject matter itself," he says.
   An example of this low-key approach is a letter sent by
the coalition of companies and lobbying groups last March to
members of Congress. Signed by more than 80 associations and
companies, including IBM, Exxon Corp.'s Exxon Co. U.S.A. unit
and Boise Cascade Corp., the letter doesn't call for outright
opposition to the bill. Instead, it expresses concern that
Congress is "rushing too quickly in judgment" on a bill that
"would dramatically, and, perhaps, unwarrantedly, change the
character of the nation's equal employment laws."
   The civil-rights bill's swift movement through the Senate
is a decided advantage to its proponents. Introduced last
February after much lobbying by Mr. Neas and other
civil-rights advocates, it quickly picked up strong support
in both houses of Congress. "They have been ramrodding it
through," complains Susan Meisinger, a lobbyist for the
Society for Human Resource Management, an organization
representing personnel managers.
   Mr. Lunnie says business groups began their lobbying
effort in February, shortly after the bill's contents were
made known. At a meeting of Washington corporate and
business-association representatives, he says, it quickly
became clear that business groups would have to oppose the
measure. The coalition was formed shortly thereafter.
   The business groups weren't able to move sooner, Mr.
Lunnie says, because they didn't want to "sit there and take
shots" at what might be in the bill. "Quite frankly," he
says, "it's an extremely complex law."
