   Why do good armies fail?
   This is the question the authors of "Military Misfortunes:
The Anatomy of Failure in War" (Macmillan/Free Press, 296
pages, $22.95) seek to answer by analyzing five campaigns
that resulted in notable defeats (and, of course, notable
victories for the other side).

   The failure of the British landing at Gallipoli designed
to break the stalemate on the Western Front in 1915; the
shocking shipping losses we suffered from German U-boats in
1942; the rout of our Eighth Army from its advanced positions
near the Yalu River in Korea in 1950; the surprise and defeat
of the Israelis in 1973; and the catastrophic collapse of the
French in 1940. These are the "lost victories" examined by
Eliot A. Cohen, a strategic analyst at Harvard's Olin
Institute, and John Gooch, a British professor of military
history.
   By misfortunes, the authors mean "failures attributable
neither to gross disproportions in odds nor to egregious
incompetence on the part of the victim nor yet to
extraordinary skill on the part of the victor." Indeed, in
all five instances, the forces seemed balanced in the
beginning. So what determined the outcome?
   Not surprisingly, Messrs. Cohen and Gooch did not find one
specific cause nor any particularly discernible common thread
fitting all five case histories. But they do single out one
principal culprit: poor military organization. In their view,
organizational failure often was more culpable than specific
decisions made during battle. Indeed, both authors reject
what they call the "Man in the Dock" theory and generally
absolve individual commanders from singlehandedly engineering
their defeats, even though some of their actions may have
been dismally inadequate.
   A good example is Gen. Ian Hamilton, commander at
Gallipoli. Once he failed to receive the corps commanders he
had wanted, Hamilton seems to have lacked the imagination to
rethink his options and further exacerbated the situation
with his hands-off approach to military command. A concept
well-established in the upper echelons of the British army,
it also was exemplified by Lt. Gen. Frederick Stopford, who
"commanded" the IX Corps at Suvla Bay by so remote a control
that he used small boats to communicate with his troops while
he remained at sea.
   Even Gen. Maurice-Gustave Gamelin, who commanded the
French forces in 1940 with such passive incompetence, escapes
total blame. Among other things, "captured intelligence
information was often transmitted too slowly up the chain of
command to have any operational effect," the authors suggest.
   So it comes as no particular surprise that Gen. Douglas
MacArthur is specifically absolved from responsibility for
the bloody defeats the Chinese inflicted on the United
Nations forces at Yalu River in 1950. The general often is
blamed for provoking the Chinese by advancing on the Yalu,
but the authors take a broader view: "Once the U.N., and
above all the American government, had adopted the goal of
unifying Korea, it set in motion the Chinese intervention.
MacArthur shared, no doubt, in the making of a flawed policy,
but he did not initiate or determine it."
   But most often the authors come back to their theory that
we should seek the causes of defeat in the characteristics of
military organization, the climate in which it must work, its
all too frequent emphasis on lessons from past wars, and
inherent structural rigidities.
   This does not really explain why some military forces win
and some lose -- but adaptability, ingenuity, the flexibility
derived from living in free societies (although dictatorships
do win from time to time), and finally the will to win can
overcome structural organizational problems.
   Messrs. Cohen and Gooch have done their job well. They
have mastered their sources, used considerable imagination in
choosing campaigns to study, and developed criteria and
original theories to explain the outcome of the battles
chosen for study.
   Also, despite occasional irregularities of style of
presentation, the book is well-written and generally sound in
judgment. I would quarrel most notably with their view that
it was the French First Army that saved the British at
Dunkirk -- rather than the British Expeditionary Force itself
and the hastily assembled evacuation fleet. Also, I do not
believe the authors attach enough importance to the failure
of democracies to support their military in peacetime, and
the consequent haste and waste inevitably involved in trying
in a few months to make up for years of neglect.
   Still, these are minor quibbles with a book that ably
describes "the problem of command in the age of large and
complicated organizations." It will, I hope, be carefully
studied in schools that prepare our future leaders for battle
and command.
