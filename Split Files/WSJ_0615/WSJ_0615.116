   LIMA -- It was supposed to be a close presidential
election. But on Sunday, Alberto Fujimori astounded pollsters
(including myself) by overwhelming rival candidate Mario
Vargas Llosa 57% to 36%, with 7% of the ballots blank or
null. Mr. Fujimori's victory in this runoff election was
brought about by a combination of support from new and old
power blocks in Peru. However, as he begins the difficult
task of putting together a new administration, those who
helped bring him to power seem somewhat reluctant to step
into the fire that he has been elected to put out.
   As a consequence of policy mistakes, mismanagement and
corruption during the administration of outgoing President
Alan Garcia, inflation in Peru has surpassed an accumulated
1,000,000% since 1985, the year Mr. Garcia became president.
Wages and salaries are worth, at present, half of what they
were in 1985. The country is $2 billion in arrears to
multilateral financing agencies, not to mention the
accumulated unpaid debts to other countries, suppliers and
private banks. If possible, many in the international
financing community would just prefer to erase Peru entirely
from the map.

   In the past 30 months, Mr. Vargas Llosa became the paladin
against Mr. Garcia's populist measures: He opposed Mr.
Garcia's failed attempts to nationalize the banks; he unified
the center-right opposition; and he worked out a detailed
government program, including plans to combat inflation
immediately, reinsert Peru into world trade and finance,
privatize state-owned enterprises and re-direct fiscal
expenditures to benefit only those who are in greatest need.
   During the campaign, Mr. Vargas Llosa requested a "clear
mandate" in order to carry out these reforms in a country
partially suspicious of a successful, white and cosmopolitan
candidate. At the peak of his campaign, however, the polls
indicated 40% of the voters in his favor. Still, bearing in
mind the crisis that his main adversaries -- Mr. Garcia's
APRA party and the unpopular left-wing factions -- were
experiencing, his victory seemed imminent. Until a dark horse
appeared.
   Out of public attention -- which focused on a polarization
of the once-leading candidates -- Mr. Fujimori's campaign was
working practically from door to door. Campaign work was
conducted by small and "informal" entrepreneurs and by the
main Christian evangelical groups. One month prior to April's
first-round election, Mr. Garcia realized the potential of
this totally new political face.
   Until then, the relationship between Mr. Garcia and Mr.
Fujimori had been one of mutual sympathy, though of little
importance. Mr. Fujimori had been flirting with the APRA
party since 1980. For instance, he directed a weekly
political program on the state-owned television channel
called Concertando ("seeking agreement"). In this way, he
became better known outside the National Agrarian University,
where he was rector. His decision to run as a presidential
candidate was probably well considered by Mr. Garcia who, at
the time, was mounting an everyone-against-Vargas Llosa
campaign in order to prevent his nemesis from obtaining the
51% he needed to become president in the first round.
   When Mr. Garcia's finely tuned political instincts told
him that Mr. Fujimori could become a front-runner, the
president rejected his own party's candidate and supported
Mr. Fujimori behind APRA's back. It is not known whether Mr.
Garcia demanded something in exchange; maybe he acted-as Mr.
Fujimori implicitly has declared -- just for the pleasure of
humiliating Mr. Vargas Llosa.
   The outcome of the first round placed Mr. Fujimori at the
threshold of the presidency. Mr. Vargas Llosa's campaign had
become so polarized against APRA and the left, that it was
reasonable to suppose that these forces would combine their
accumulated 28% with Mr. Fujimori's 24%, in order to surpass
Mr. Vargas Llosa's 28% in the June runoff. In fact, the final
tally was pretty close to this mark.
   Between the April and June elections, Mr. Fujimori
realized he had to collect a minimal team that could draft a
platform to confront Mr. Vargas Llosa's full brigade of
specialists. One of those to whom he turned was the
world-famous Peruvian economist, and champion of Peru's
underground economy, Hernando de Soto. Mr. de Soto had been
backing Mr. Vargas Llosa-a founding member of Mr. de Soto's
Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD)-until they had a
falling-out two years ago. Mr. Fujimori now asked for the
support of Mr. de Soto, declaring that he was "counting not
only on Mr. de Soto's collaboration, but on the institute's,
as well." Politics makes strange bedfellows indeed.
   In the end, Mr. Fujimori's structure of alliances paid off
well. As the results of the day's voting became clear, Mr.
Vargas Llosa, looking very relaxed, conceded defeat the same
night with charm and good manners. Mr. Fujimori, on the other
hand, looked tense and disorganized as he attempted to call
to order a chaotic news conference (he shows little trust in
his aides). Pressure was beginning to build in a man who
doesn't have a precise agenda, a defined economic team, a
structured political organization, a parliamentary majority,
credibility from the local business community, or sufficient
contacts abroad for attempting to solve the country's worst
crisis in its history.
   The president-elect's first comments were parsimonious and
prudent. He called for a national consensus and announced a
coming trip to the U.S., Europe and, of course, Japan. (It is
conventional wisdom in Lima that because of national pride,
in the year of Emperor Akihito's crowning, Tokyo will not
allow Mr. Fujimori's government to fail.)
   According to sources within the ILD, Mr. de Soto already
was offered and has rejected the job of prime minister. When,
in 1987, Mr. de Soto was backing Mr. Vargas Llosa, he
apparently expected that post. Since then, however, his
institute has gained such enormous international prestige
that he apparently is unwilling to risk tainting the ILD in
the risky game of national politics. Nevertheless, it is
likely he will become a member of Mr. Fujimori's kitchen
cabinet, since he combines well an understanding of the
informal sector -- which supported Mr. Fujimori -- with an
important set of contacts abroad.
   Currently, Lima is crowded with potential counselors. On
Monday, Harvard's "shock treatment" economist, Jeffrey Sachs,
will be coming to town to present a detailed stabilization
program he has designed with a group of young Peruvian
economists led by Carlos Paredes.
   My best guess is that, in two weeks' time, Mr. Fujimori
will go on his worldwide tour with very little decided
regarding his team and program. He will want to hear first
whatever Washington and Tokyo may have to say. On his return,
he will have only another two weeks before his inauguration.
He probably will come up with an heterogeneous team and a
wishful-thinking adjustment program. It would be unfair to
demand that Mr. Fujimori's first bullet should kill the
inflation tiger. Pray God he may have another chance, and
that he learns to shoot in the meantime.
