   Two new reports point to more tough economic times ahead
for much of the Northeast.
   Chief executive officers of midsized companies in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut have turned more pessimistic
about the economy, with the majority expecting a recession in
1991, according to a survey sponsored by National Westminster
Bancorp., a New York-based unit of National Westminster Bank
PLC, London.

   And the New England economy -- already battered by a real
estate collapse and the shrinkage of many of the region's
computer companies -- is expected to suffer from a cutback in
the defense budget over the next five years. Those cuts could
cause a 1% to 2% job loss in the region, according to a
soon-to-be-published article by Yolanda K. Henderson, an
economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
   Two-thirds of the 550 chief executives in the NatWest
survey said the national economy worsened over the past year,
while only 6% saw improvement. The proportion of them
expecting a recession in the coming year rose to 54% from 44%
a year ago.
   But the executives were more upbeat about their own
industries than about the overall economy. Nearly 60% said
they expect business to be better next year, only slightly
lower than last year's 63%. As for the current year, 49% said
business has improved from 1989 levels. The report sampled
companies in 50 industries with annual sales ranging from $5
million to $250 million.
   The discrepancy between the executives' national and local
outlooks seemed more psychological than economic, said Peter
A. Radford, NatWest's chief economist. "They feel they have
more control and more knowledge about customers and order
books, so they have more confidence about their own economy
than the national economy," he said.
   However, Mr. Radford said, views across the tri-state
region are more diverse this year than last. Officials in New
York City were the most pessimistic, while those in
Westchester County, just north of the city, were the most
optimistic in the latest survey. The readings were reflected
in a business confidence index, measuring the degree of
executive optimism in several areas including expansion,
borrowing, hiring and relocation.
   That index was highest in Westchester, with a reading of
95, down from last year's 101 but much higher than New York
City's 75. Last year, the city reading was 93. The index uses
1988 as a base level of 100. Mr. Radford said New York City
and New Jersey readings probably were depressed by news of
large state and local budget deficits.
   The survey also found that companies in the region are
operating at 78.4% of capacity, down from 81.6% a year ago. A
downward trend was also noted in expansion plans: 55% of the
officials said they expect to expand in the next two years,
down from 58% a year ago.
   The executives said major drawbacks in the tri-state area
include rising health care costs, state and local taxes,
crime, cost of office space, and drugs in the workplace. The
major benefit cited was the sizable local market for goods
and services.
   Ms. Henderson, the economist at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston, writes in an article to be published this summer
that defense contracting amounts to about 8% of the New
England economy, compared with 5.9% nationally, so defense
cuts will have a disproportionate effect.
   Moreover, she writes, defense spending will probably be
cut more sharply in New England than in other regions because
the region has a disproportionate share of procurement
revenue, and procurement is likely to be slashed more than
other areas of the defense budget such as personnel or
maintenance.
   Connecticut, where 7.5% of all goods and services produced
are for military use, is likely to be hit especially hard,
she says in the article, citing the state's aircraft and
submarine contracts in particular.
   General Dynamics Co.'s Electric Boat division makes
submarines in Connecticut, and United Technologies Corp.'s
helicopter and jet engine operations are in the state as
well.
   Massachusetts, where more of the procurement revenue comes
from missile and electronics work, probably won't be hit as
hard, she writes.
   In terms of employment, she projects that if defense
spending is cut by $4.1 billion over five years as proposed
by President Bush, the region would lose 57,000 jobs, or 0.9%
of its non-agricultural work force. Sharper cutbacks favored
by some in Congress would result in losses of as many as
134,000 jobs or 2% of the work force. Moreover, she said,
these jobs are typically relatively highly paid and held by
experienced workers who will have a difficult time finding
other suitable jobs.
   "These projected slowdowns in defense-related activities
are far from devastating, but they will feel burdensome in
the context of simultaneous weakness in the real estate,
financial services and computer industries," Ms. Henderson
writes.
