   NEW YORK -- Real estate syndicate manager CRI Inc., which
has been twice rebuffed in efforts to take over the
management of four real estate partnerships managed by
Integrated Resources Inc., is seeking to take its offer
directly to the partnership investors.
   A real estate investment trust managed by Rockville,
Md.-based CRI this week filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission a proposal to offer to swap interests in
two of its real estate ventures for the Integrated
partnership interests. At the same time, CRI in two lawsuits
accused Integrated's management of trying to entrench itself
at the expense of its partnership investors.

   The hostile proposal shapes up as a bruising legal and
financial struggle with implications for thousands of
investors in the Integrated partnerships as well as CRI's and
Integrated's managements and for bondholders facing hundreds
of millions of dollars in losses on their Integrated
investments. Integrated is operating under protection from
creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   CRI values its proposed offer at about $664 million, based
on recent prices and book values of the four Integrated
partnerships, known as American Insured Mortgage Investors,
for which funds were raised between 1984 and 1988. The funds
have about 64,000 investors.
   CRI argues that its proposed offer should be attractive to
American Insured investors because it would offer lower fees,
liquidity, more flexibility in selling the investments, and
elimination of the uncertainties connected to the Integrated
bankruptcy-law proceeding. The American Insured partnerships
aren't part of the bankruptcy-law process and continue to
operate.
   CRI has proposed to exchange shares of CRI Insured
Mortgage Association Inc., traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, or of a new company, AIM Liquidating REIT Inc., for
the units in the American Insured ventures. But the exchange
offer faces a number of hurdles, not the least of which is
the likely opposition of Integrated, which has been trying to
sell its general partnership investment in the four funds. A
purchaser of the Integrated investment would be in effect
buying a stream of income from management fees connected to
the American Insured partnerships.
   If CRI receives a majority of the American Insured
partnership interests through its exchange offer, it then
will propose to acquire all of the partnerships. CRI assumes
it would be able to replace the general partner, whose
approval of an acquisition also is required. However, CRI
warned that Integrated might try to delay any attempts to
take control.
   CRI is a real estate investment firm that manages mortgage
investment portfolios valued at more than $4 billion. CRI
Insured Mortgage is a real estate investment trust that
specializes in the market for federally insured mortgages on
multifamily housing. Its mortgage investments are valued at
$110.7 million. It also has a 67% interest in CRI Liquidating
Co., a REIT also listed on the Big Board that owns 103
mortgage investments with a value of about $356.7 million.
   According to the SEC filing, CRI was approached by
Integrated's management in September and asked if it would be
interested in buying the entities that manage the American
Insured partnerships. Integrated renewed the inquiry in
January, while it also was talking to other possible
investors.
   CRI said in early February that it offered $55 million for
the American Insured management entities and later that month
boosted the offer to $60 million. However, Integrated instead
gained bankruptcy court approval to conduct an auction for
the American Insured management business. It set a $40
million minimum bid but has subsequently said it didn't
receive any cash bids above that price that didn't include
various conditions. Integrated today is scheduled to
recommend a bid to the bankruptcy court.
   The value of the management business, however, could
change if CRI were able to proceed with its offer directly to
investors because the expected management income from the
partnerships could decline.
   Similarly, bondholders, who hold $1.8 billion in
Integrated debt, have an interest in seeing the company get
as much as possible for the American Insured management
business. The value of Integrated's assets has fallen sharply
in recent months, and debt holders may receive less than 50
cents on the dollar for their investments. The company's
investment syndication business collapsed last June when it
couldn't roll over commercial paper borrowings and faced a
severe liquidity squeeze.
   Earlier this week, Stephen D. Weinroth, chairman of
Integrated, said CRI's lawsuits and exchange offer are
"obviously trying to discourage potential buyers," but added
that he didn't know the exact terms of the offer.
   At this point, it isn't clear whether the bankruptcy court
would be asked to step in to prevent CRI's offer. Integrated
has argued that it has the right to sell the management
business without soliciting permission of the partnership
investors.
   CRI also has made its exchange offer contingent on
reversing a change Integrated made in its management contract
for the American Insured investments just a day before it
filed for bankruptcy-court protection. CRI's lawsuits, filed
in Delaware and California state courts, assert that the
contract changes "entrench" the general partners and impede
the ability of the investors to replace the manager. "The AIM
investors are entitled to a voice in the management of their
partnerships," said William B. Dockser, chairman of CRI.
