   ATLANTA -- A vendor involved in a scheme in which a
Southern Co. unit made illegal political contributions is
expected to plead guilty next week and to cooperate with a
continuing federal investigation of the affair.
   Fred Suttles Jr., president of Outdoor Media Inc., has
agreed to plead guilty in federal court here to filing a
false corporate tax return, those familiar with the matter
said. Mr. Suttles declined to comment.

   Outdoor Media, a Pensacola, Fla., outdoor advertising
concern, was a vendor for Gulf Power Co., the Southern Co.
unit, and rented billboard space to the utility. According to
those familiar with the matter, Mr. Suttles directed his
employees to make political campaign contributions to various
candidates designated by Gulf Power and then reimbursed his
employees for the contributions. In an earlier interview, Mr.
Suttles acknowledged that the arrangement called for him to
obtain reimbursement from Gulf Power by inflating his
invoices to the utility, but he never got an opportunity to
do so. His run-in with the Internal Revenue Service stems
from his listing the reimbursements to employees as
legitimate business expenses.
   Gulf Power pleaded guilty last October to two felony
counts, conspiracy to make illegal political contributions
and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. of income taxes.
   In papers filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office last fall
laying out the basis for Gulf Power's guilty plea,
prosecutors said they were prepared to present testimony from
Mr. Suttles that "it was common knowledge among Gulf Power
Co. vendors" that they had to comply with requests for
political contributions if they wanted to get Gulf Power
contracts.
   Mr. Suttles' plea isn't expected to have any impact on
Gulf Power: Gulf Power's plea agreement, under which the
company paid a $500,000 fine, put its criminal exposure in
the matter behind it. However, the IRS's investigation of
individuals involved in the political contributions scheme
has continued and further charges are anticipated, those
familiar with the investigation said.
   A Gulf Power spokesman said the company had dismissed the
employees involved in the political contributions scheme "and
we've moved on."
   Gulf Power has said that Jacob F. Horton, a former senior
vice president, directed the political contributions scheme.
However, his family and friends assert that while Mr. Horton
was involved, too much blame has been pinned on him. Mr.
Horton was killed last April in a company plane crash, the
cause of which has yet to be determined.
