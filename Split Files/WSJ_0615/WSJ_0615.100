   New York -- They were called "the Parisians of Africa."
One prominent collector of their handiwork proclaimed "every
cup, every pipe, every spoon a work of art." They were the
Mangbetu people of northeastern Zaire and, with the arrival
of the first Europeans a century ago, their name became
synonymous with an elegant style of art based on the human
figure.
   But the anthropomorphic creations that put them on the map
-- knives, harps, pottery and other implements carved to
resemble fashionable men and women -- weren't really a
Mangbetu tradition. And frequently the artists who made them
weren't Mangbetu either.

   At least that's the contention of a provocative new show
here at the American Museum of Natural History, "African
Reflections: Art From Northeastern Zaire." The more than 450
objects, the majority collected on the museum's own
Lang-Chapin expedition at the turn of the century and never
before exhibited, would command interest on aesthetic grounds
alone. But in the context created by curators Enid
Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim they also tell a story -- one
of colonialism, cultural interaction and change.
   The classic "Mangbetu" pieces, many the work of
neighboring peoples but erroneously attributed by early
collectors because those depicted were so unmistakably
Mangbetu, make the curators' case for taking a more regional
view of African art than the standard tribal pigeonholing.
   For a more traditional look at the area, the Metropolitan
Museum offers "Art of Central Africa: Masterpieces From the
Berlin Museum fur Volkerkunde." The 61 selections from the
vast holdings of this anthropological institution, on view
for the first time in the U.S., are contemporaries of the
objects in "African Reflections." Drawn from several
neighboring groups, they help place the Mangbetu-style art in
the African landscape. ("Art of Central Africa" will be here
until Nov. 4; "African Reflections" is up through Jan. 6
before a tour beginning in Washington at the National Museum
of African Art, March 5, 1991-Jan. 14, 1992).
   From the start, the Mangbetu seem to have had a special
fascination for outsiders. German botanist Georg
Schweinfurth, in 1870 the first European to visit their royal
court, did much to create the mystique with his memoir "The
Heart of Africa." Judging by a tableau in the "African
Reflections" show, re-created from one of Schweinfurth's
splendid drawings, it's not hard to see why he was impressed.
   Here sits King Mbunza, a commanding coppery presence,
resplendent from his towering basketry hat with its train of
eagle feathers down to the brass bands sheathing his legs.
Imagine what it must have been like to see -- as Schweinfurth
did -- the monarch in his Great Hall dancing dervish-like
before his 180 wives] But for all his rhapsodizing about
Mangbetu magnificence, Schweinfurth made no mention of any
anthropomorphic art.
   By the time of the expedition by mammologist/photographer
Herbert Lang and ornithologist/artist James Chapin (190915)
it was clearly another story. Everywhere you look in this
sprawling show you see the bound, elongated heads that were
the hallmark of elegance among Mangbetu -- carved into the
ivory necks of harps and horns, adorning ceramic pots and
bark boxes, even European-style pipes. Who made this art --
and why -- is one of the major themes of the exhibition and
its scholarly catalog (272 pages, $45 hard cover, $27.50
paper). Authors Schildkrout and Keim explain that while the
Mangbetu had a rich aesthetic bent, it was expressed
primarily through the striking geometric designs that
decorated everything from arrows to arms. However,
surrounding peoples carved human likenesses -- including
those of their Mangbetu neighbors. European patronage
encouraged the development of the anthropomorphic genre (and
its production by the Mangbetu themselves); chiefs
commissioned pieces to win favor with colonial officials.
   Though nothing might seem more African than these images
of gazelle-eyed women with their halo hairdos (see
accompanying drawing), in a sense they are as much
reflections of the foreign visitors as the two wooden pipes
portraying Lang and Chapin. After all, the Mangbetu were not
curiosities, like the Congo peacock, waiting to be
discovered, but people responsive to the new arrivals. For
instance, Europeans who saw Chief Okondo's Great Hall around
1913 undoubtedly thought he'd continued the architectural
tradition of his predecessor, Mbunza. In reality, the
curators point out, the structure was built only after a
visit by Lang -- who had expressed his disappointment at not
finding the grand edifice described by Schweinfurth.
   Although anthropomorphic art is the focus of "African
Reflections," the show contains plenty of other fascinating
items. In the section on musical instruments, which pulses
with the sound of elephant-hunting songs and signal drums,
you can gaze with impunity at the once-feared double iron
bell (staring into this symbol of chieftancy was said to
cause death). And you can look at, if not listen to, the big
animal-shaped slit drums. When the wind blew through these,
the label explains, the instruments made moaning sounds like
those of the animals they represented.
   Interspersed among the objects are some of Lang's
arresting archival photographs of the Mangbetu, which help
put a human face on the exhibit. There's also a display about
the okapi, the elusive relative of the giraffe that inspired
the Lang-Chapin expedition in the first place. Not only did
the pair succeed in their mission to capture specimens of
this and other rare mammals, they brought back a whopping 54
tons of material for all departments of the museum --
including 4,000 objects from the Mangbetu and neighboring
peoples.
   For the museum's purposes, the collection arrived just in
time. Soon after, as colonial rule took hold in Mangbetuland
and cash crops supplanted art as the preferred trade
currency, the anthropomorphic genre began to die out. By
contrast, artifacts very similar to those in the Metropolitan
Museum's show, particularly the elaborate masks worn at
initiations and funerals, still are in use today.
   Masks are one of the three genres featured in this
selection of Central African art. The others are regalia and
"power figures," sculptures designed to channel spiritual
forces. There are enough examples of each to highlight
regional differences in style, discussed at greater length in
the catalog (87 pages, $16.95). For instance, the three Kuba
masks, lavishly ornamented with cowrie shells, beading and
painted designs, are worlds apart from the Luba specimen, its
characteristic rounded form and smooth finish elegantly
simple.
   Yet for all their differences, the objects here, as well
as those at the Museum of Natural History, have something
more significant in common. "Many people have the idea that
Africans didn't produce art for art's sake," says that show's
curator, Ms. Schildkrout. "I hope visitors will go away
believing that these people cared very much about things
being beautiful."
