   FREMONT, Calif. -- Vitalink Communications Corp. said
George Archuleta, chairman, chief executive officer and
president, resigned.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Vitalink plunged
$3.25 to close at $9.625, a 25% loss, making it the biggest
percentage loser on the OTC market for the day.

   Mr. Archuleta also resigned as a director. The company
said he will be succeeded as chief executive by Donald J.
Herman, a director, who will serve until a permanent
replacement for Mr. Archuleta can be found.
   The company gave no reason for Mr. Archuleta's departure.
However, Mr. Herman said the company sees "a reasonable
possibility" that its earnings won't meet analysts' estimates
of between 21 cents and 28 cents a share for its fiscal third
quarter, ending June 30.
   The news of Mr. Archuleta's resignation and Mr. Herman's
forecast combined to batter the stock of the data
communications products firm.
   Several large blocks of Vitalink stock changed hands on
the day. The trading volume was 3.5 million shares.
   Vitalink's stock has been sliding steadily from a 52-week
high of $20.375 in October. Analysts have said that the
company is being hurt by flagging sales under an agreement
with Digital Equipment Corp., which resells Vitalink's remote
bridge products, used to connect local area communications
networks. Analysts say a different product, known as routers,
is gaining favor as a network connector, at the expense of
remote bridges.
   In the six months ended March 31, Vitalink earned $8.8
million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $36.9 million.
