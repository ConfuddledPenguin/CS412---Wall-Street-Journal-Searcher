   PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fred Meyer Inc. said it reached a new
financing agreement with 10 major banks that more than
doubles the retailing chain's credit line to $335 million.
   The company said Continental Illinois Corp.'s main unit
heads the bank group.

   Fred Meyer said it expanded its credit line to help
finance expected growth and to help pay for upgrading its
computer systems.
   The company was hurt in 1989 by writeoffs on computer
hardware, higher sales promotion costs and other unusual
costs. It had a loss for the year of $6.8 million on sales of
$2.28 billion.
