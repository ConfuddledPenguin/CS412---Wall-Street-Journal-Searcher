   WASHINGTON -- The Senate, trying to save face and buy time
for deficit-reduction talks with the White House, approved a
skeleton budget resolution that would cap total fiscal 1991
discretionary spending at 1990 levels.
   The largely procedural measure, approved on a voice vote,
is designed to allow appropriations bills to proceed in both
houses while the budget summit continues. But the proposed
$503 billion cap on would hold spending on defense and
domestic programs $10 billion below the level of the
House-passed resolution, setting the stage for a contentious
conference between the two chambers.

   Bush administration officials had tried to discourage
Congress from going ahead with appropriations, hoping to keep
pressure on the summit to reach a speedy agreement. But
Democrats and some congressional Republicans insisted. The
administration then sought to keep the spending total in the
Senate measure as low as possible.
   "If we simply put everything on hold right now, we will be
in terrible shape if the summit doesn't come to a
conclusion," said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.). Progress on appropriations bills, even
if they need to be modified after a summit agreement, "puts
us in a better bargaining position at the summit," he added.
   Next week is shaping up as an important one for the budget
summit, as negotiators hope finally to move from what has
been dubbed "the seminar stage" to discussing
deficit-reduction packages. White House Budget Director
Richard Darman met yesterday with House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who chairs the talks, to schedule
more-frequent meetings beginning next Tuesday.
   Democratic negotiators continue to insist that President
Bush make the first move and put a new proposal on the table.
But they say that Mr. Darman hasn't signaled whether he is
willing to go along.
   Negotiators from both parties said that failure to make
progress soon will be a bad sign. "If we haven't made any
movement by the end of next week," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R.,
Texas), "the odds are we're not going to get anything."
   Rep. Panetta gives it about two weeks. "Most members of
the summit feel that we'll have a pretty good idea by July 4
whether or not we're confident enough to continue to meet,"
he said.
   The Senate maneuvering came as the House Rules Committee
cleared the way for action next week on the first of the
spending bills for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and
approved a resolution setting formal allocations for
appropriations in line with the House budget. In a series of
party-line votes, the Democratic majority rejected plans to
cut $10 billion and $22 billion from budget levels previously
approved by the House. Still, there is sure to be bipartisan
pressure to make at least modest across-the-board cuts when
lawmakers take up the individual appropriations bills.
   Despite the administration's anxiety, the prospect of
spending fights on the floor is welcome to many on both sides
in the chamber. House GOP Leader Robert Michel appears bent
on testing the resolve of his own party's members -- as well
as Democrats -- on the question of budget cuts, and Mr.
Panetta suggested that the appropriations action is needed to
spur on the summit talks. "If you want to put pressure on the
summit," said the Californian, "continue the work of the
House."
   As the majority party, Democrats must preserve some
semblance of a budget process. And however unhappy with the
Senate strategy, the House leadership itself needs time to
advance bills spelling out its spending priorities in this
election year. "What we keep alive is appropriations bills
that reflect our priorities," said a Democratic leadership
aide. "That is the end game."
   The first bill up, providing $20.9 billion for energy and
water programs, would substantially add to President Bush's
budget for cleaning up nuclear-weapons plants and further bid
up funding for solar energy accounts, which would grow by 41%
from fiscal 1990. A $83.6 billion housing, veterans, and
space bill severely pares the White House's costly moon and
Mars initiative, but adds $3.75 billion elsewhere for federal
contributions to assisted housing for elderly and low-income
families.
   Part of the increase is to meet the high cost of renewing
existing leases under the Section 8 housing program. But the
measure also assumes a 45,000-unit increase in the new and
existing subsidized housing above the level that can be
financed by current appropriations.
   Water projects approved by the House Appropriations
Committee include $5 million to accelerate engineering work
and begin real-estate acquisition on the estimated $900
million Olmstead locks and dam project in Illinois and
Kentucky. A group of Michigan universities backed by Rep. Bob
Traxler (D., Mich.) would receive an additional $8 million
from space-related appropriations, while a Treasury and
Postal Service bill of more than $20 billion allocates funds
to assorted hospital and reasearch projects including
Brandeis University in Massachusetts.
   Though House and Senate Appropriations Committees retain
final power in allocating discretionary spending, the normal
budget debate traditionally provides a first test of
Congress's priorities. By shortcutting the process now, the
Senate action would leave even more discretion to its
appropriations panel under former Majority Leader Robert Byrd
(D., W.Va.). Whatever total spending figure is agreed to with
the House, equally important is how it would be divided
between military and domestic accounts.
   The Senate budget resolution calls for $482.5 billion in
budget authority for defense and annually appropriated
domestic accounts, and $503.4 billion in outlays. The
remainder of the $1.2 trillion budget, including spending on
Social Security and interest on the national debt, is
nondiscretionary and doesn't require annual appropriations
bills.
