   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office found that
monthly cable-television rates rose 10% in 1989, roughly
double the pace of inflation -- a finding that is certain to
strengthen lawmakers' resolve to pass legislation
re-regulating cable.
   The study is a companion to a survey a year ago that
showed a 29% increase in the average cable subscriber's
monthly fees for the lowest-priced service between December
1986 and October 1988.

   The GAO, Congress's auditing arm, said that monthly fees
for both the lowest-priced service and the most popular basic
service increased an average of 10%, while cable operators
added only one or two channels. The consumer price index for
the year rose about 5%. The average cost of the lowest-priced
cable service rose to $15.95 for 31 channels from $14.50 for
30 channels, and the most popular basic service rose to
$16.33 for 34 channels from $14.91 for 32 channels, the GAO
said. The study also showed a 5% increase in revenue per
subscriber in 1989.
   The study was prepared for the House Telecommunications
and Finance Subcommittee, which plans to vote on cable
re-regulation legislation this month.
   The National Cable Television Association said the GAO
report "reconfirms that the average cable subscriber's
monthly bill increased at about the rate of inflation in
1989, and is still further evidence that cable rate increases
have leveled off."
