   DETROIT -- Despite disappointing sales so far this spring,
U.S. auto makers plan to boost production during the third
quarter, reflecting lean inventories and concern about labor
talks this summer.
   Industry sources predict the 10 major auto makers in the
U.S. will build 1,564,216 cars in the third quarter, up 12.2%
from the relatively weak year-earlier level. All but Chrysler
Corp. and Nissan Motor Corp. expect to build more cars during
the 1990 third quarter than they did a year ago.

   But the industry's more robust output plans don't
necessarily reflect an expectation of stronger demand. John
Qualls, an analyst with Hill &amp; Knowlton, said he expects
domestic cars to sell at a 6.7 million vehicle annual rate
during the third quarter, while the production schedules
indicate output will run at a 7.6 million car annual rate for
the quarter. That means auto makers may have to trim their
schedules by as many as 100,000 cars and trucks if sales
don't pick up, Mr. Qualls said.
   What auto makers have going in their favor is that
depressed first- and second-quarter production schedules have
helped the Big Three keep inventories down, even though sales
have been sluggish since February.
   As of May 31, Chrysler had a 56-day supply of cars,
General Motors Corp. a 62-day supply and Ford Motor Co. a
69-day supply, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a
trade journal. These levels are well within the 65-to-70 day
range considered optimal.
   Further, analysts say sales aren't the only factor
affecting production plans for this summer.
   GM and Ford may be planning to beef up output in part as a
hedge against a possible strike by the United Auto Workers
union this fall. The UAW's contracts with the Big Three
expire Sept. 14. Bargaining is expected to begin next month.
   The decision by Chrysler to cut its third-quarter car
production by 5.1%, despite relatively low inventories and
the possibility of a UAW strike, reflects the No. 3 auto
maker's sharply lower sales and the shutdown earlier this
year of a subcompact car plant in Detroit. Chrysler's sales
are off 17.5% for the year to date, and its share of the U.S.
car market has dropped to 9.7% from 10.9% a year ago.
   GM and Ford also are having sales problems. GM's sales are
down 6% so far this year, and its share of the U.S. car
market slipped to 35.5% in May from 37% a year earlier.
Ford's year-to-date sales are off 11.7%, and its share of the
passenger car market fell to 18.8% in May from 21.5% a year
ago.
   Despite soft sales, GM and Ford plan to increase
production in the July-to-September period by 13.3% and
14.5%, respectively. But GM and Ford face a potential
problem: Many dealers, worried by the weak market, are
reluctant to lay in heavy supplies of vehicles.
   "I don't want a bunch of cars I can't sell," said Glenn
Cain, general sales manager of Desmond Pontiac in Cincinnati.
Desmond currently has a relatively modest 60-day supply of
vehicles.
   Meanwhile, Japanese auto makers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. have planned sharp increases in their U.S. car
output, reflecting their market share and sales gains this
year. The Chrysler-Mitsubishi Motors Corp. joint venture,
Diamond Star Motors, and the GM-Toyota joint venture plant in
Fremont, Calif., plan healthy increases, too.
   Nissan said its third-quarter car production will fall by
18.2% because its Smyrna, Tenn., factory will be slowed to
re-tool for the launch of a redesigned 1991 Sentra subcompact
model in August.
   Here are estimated car and truck production schedules for
the third quarter:

   Soft demand apparently is convincing auto makers to hold
production schedules for the remainder of the second quarter
at virtually the same levels planned earlier this year. Here
are production schedules for the second quarter:
