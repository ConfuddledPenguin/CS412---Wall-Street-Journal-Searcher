   IRVINE, Calif. -- Mission Power Engineering Co., a unit of
SCEcorp., said it terminated its contract for the engineering
and construction of three geothermal power generating plants
in the Coso and China Lake areas of California, which are
owned and operated by California Energy Co., San Francisco.
   "We've just walked off the job," said Jack Adrian, Mission
Power's president and chief executive officer.

   The termination of the contract follows Mission Power's
filing of a lawsuit on June 5 against California Energy and
its partners in the $300 million-plus project. The complaint,
filed in state court in Inyo County, accuses California
Energy of making changes in the scope of the work, triggering
serious delays, and refusing to pay for additional costs.
   Mission Power is seeking more than $79 million in the
action, plus interest and damages for alleged fraud and
misrepresentation by California Energy.
   Michael Heys, California Energy's president, maintained
yesterday that his company has appropriately compensated
Mission Power. "There is nothing due on contractural work,"
he said. "In fact, there has been an overpayment of
$170,000."
   Mr. Heys added that the power plants at the center of the
dispute are "substantially complete" and, therefore, Mission
Power's walkout will not cause "an interruption of
operations."
