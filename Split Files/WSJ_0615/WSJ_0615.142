   Western Union Corp. got a green light from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to proceed with its exchange offer
aimed at averting bankruptcy court.
   However, SEC approval came as the beleaguered
communications and financial services company said it will
technically default on a $51 million semiannual interest
payment due today. A spokesman said in New York that under
the debt agreement, it still has 30 days to make the payment.

   The company has said that current cash flow can't cover
its payments on $643 million in debt and that it will be
forced to seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if
it can't work out a new payment schedule with its
bondholders.
   Western Union wants to issue new debt securities to
holders of its 19.25% senior secured reset notes due Dec. 15,
1992 and 16% notes due June 15, 1991. Debt from these notes
totals $530 million. Western Union is also seeking to
reclassify its preferred stock into new common shares.
