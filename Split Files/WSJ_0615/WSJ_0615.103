   DALLAS -- With its rescue by Japanese investors in
jeopardy, debt-mired Southland Corp. said it has sweetened
its proposed exchange offer to bondholders by an estimated
$200 million after weeks of intense negotiations.
   The new proposal, which was greeted with "tentative
optimism," according to one bond analyst, also would sharply
reduce the equity stake to be retained by the Thompson
family, which founded the giant convenience-store chain. More
importantly, if accepted by bondholders, it should enable the
operator of 7-Eleven stores to skirt a bankruptcy-court
filing. The proposal has been approved by Ito-Yokado Co. and
Seven-Eleven Japan Co., which have agreed to buy a 75% stake
in Southland if the company can restructure its $1.8 billion
in publicly traded debt.

   Southland also announced it won't pay $69 million in
interest due in cash today on two of its debt issues, as well
as additional pay-in-kind interest due on another issue, in
an effort to increase liquidity. That leaves it with a 30-day
grace period before it defaults, but with a new offer on the
table, bondholders seemed unperturbed.
   "They've made a significant move from their previous
position," said George Varughese, managing director of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., which has been advising the
bondholders.
   Under the revised exchange offer, bondholders would
receive debt securities totaling about $550 million, bearing
cash interest at rates of 12% to 14% and having maturities of
six to seven years. The original proposal called for
zero-coupon notes, which don't pay interest but increase in
value over time, and maturities of more than 10 years. A
Southland spokesman wouldn't disclose the amount of
zero-coupon notes offered in the original proposal.
   The new proposal also slices up the Southland pie into
significantly different chunks, with bondholders and
preferred shareholders receiving approximately 18.5% of the
common stock, up from about 10% in the initial swap offer.
The equity position of the Thompson family and their capital
partners would be reduced to 6.5% from the 15% they would
have gotten in the first proposal. Part of bondholders'
opposition to the original offer stemmed from the sizable
equity stake retained by the Thompsons, who founded the
company as a chain of ice stores in the 1920s.
   John Gordon of Deltec Securities Corp., who has headed the
steering committee of Southland's security holders, said the
new proposal was the result of "intense discussion in which
we were dealing with questions of how pain will be
distributed." Although some sticking points remain --
principally over apportionment of value -- a final agreement
could be in place by early next week, he added.
   Anticipating such an agreement, Southland and its
prospective Japanese investors have agreed to extend their
stock purchase agreement, which was scheduled to expire
yesterday, to Aug. 15.
   Southland, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
possible hostile bid by the Belzberg family of Canada. But
increased competition has eroded sales and profit margins,
and made it difficult for the company to service the huge
debt it took on in going private.
