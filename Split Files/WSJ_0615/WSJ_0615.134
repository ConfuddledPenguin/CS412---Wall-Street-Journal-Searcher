   TV: "House Party," a daytime syndicated show that was the
first joint venture between General Electric Co.'s NBC
Productions and Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s Group W
Productions, was canceled after only six months. The one-hour
show, which was on 33 stations, had minuscule ratings. The
venture has two other projects in the development stage.
