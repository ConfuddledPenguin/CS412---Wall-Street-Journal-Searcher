   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Brazil's top debt negotiator said
the government cannot pay all the interest on its foreign
debt this year because of a lack of foreign currency
reserves, a major newspaper reported.
   Chief negotiator Jorio Dauster said Brazil would be able
to pay only about $5 billion of the $15 billion in interest
owed to private foreign banks in 1990 without using up its
foreign reserves, the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil reported.

   "Everyone knows Brazil doesn't have the kind of money to
pay this interest," the negotiator told the newspaper.
   Brazil hasn't paid interest to private creditors on its
foreign debt since September and now is $5.6 billion in
arrears, although it has kept up interest payments to
European government lenders.
   The suspension of interest payments is intended to keep
Brazil's foreign reserves from falling below $6 billion, the
equivalent of six months of imports. Foreign reserves stand
at about $7 billion, according to the central bank.
   The negotiator said the government first wanted to
negotiate a standby pact with the International Monetary Fund
for a $2 billion bridge loan before resuming talks on back
interest payments.
   An agreement with the IMF is considered crucial to
Brazil's plans to renegotiate its $114 billion foreign debt,
the Third World's largest.
