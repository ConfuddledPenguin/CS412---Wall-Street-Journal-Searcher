   Meanwhile, a small piece of evidence has emerged to
challenge Prop. 111's supposed lesson that voters will
approve a tax if they know it will go for a specific program.
This week North Dakotans voted 59% against a temporary,
one-cent sales-tax increase to fund schools. Earmarking the
money for education didn't help -- last December North
Dakotans turned down a non-earmarked sales-tax hike by a
narrower 53% margin. The real lesson may be that voters won't
support tax increases for programs that they are convinced
fail to deliver value for money.
