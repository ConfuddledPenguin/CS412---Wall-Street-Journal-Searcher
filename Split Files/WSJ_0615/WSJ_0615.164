   NEW YORK -- United Telecommunications Inc.'s stock fell in
heavy trading after two analysts cut their earnings estimates
for the long-distance telephone company.
   While the reductions were modest, and the analysts said
they continue to recommend the purchase of United stock, the
price drop underscores investor skittishness over even
marginally negative news about growth companies.

   United's shares fell $3.25 to $40.875 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading on volume of 4.3 million shares.
The stock's normal daily volume is about 500,000 shares.
   United, which owns the nation's third-largest
long-distance telephone company, US Sprint Communications
Co., wouldn't comment on the estimates, saying it doesn't
project earnings. However, a spokesman said, "We're certainly
comforted that they still consider the stock a strong buy
recommendation."
   "I still think the stock is cheap," said Jack B. Grubman
of PaineWebber Inc., one of the analysts who cut his
estimate. "It's worth in the mid-50s."
   However, he noted that Sprint's rate of revenue growth
from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the first quarter of 1990
was only a little more than 2%. He added that American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has managed to slow the rate at
which Sprint and MCI Communications Corp. have been able to
take away long-distance market share.
   Mr. Grubman cut his second-quarter earnings estimate to 53
cents a share from 57 cents. For all of 1990, he trimmed his
estimate to $2.50 a share from $2.70 a share, and he lowered
his 1991 projection to $3.55 a share from $3.75 a share.
   Joel D. Gross of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. said he
still regards United's stock as a buy.
   "My estimates of $2.50 a share in 1990 and $3.50 in 1991
still show a 40% growth rate," said Mr. Gross. "With the
stock trading at less than 12 times earnings next year that
still looks like a buy . . . to me."
   Mr. Gross had been predicting earnings of $2.64 a share in
1990 and $3.78 a share in 1991. He lowered his estimate for
the current second quarter to 57 cents a share from 60 cents
a share.
