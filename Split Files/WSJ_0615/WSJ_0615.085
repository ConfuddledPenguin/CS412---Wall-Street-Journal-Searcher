   TORONTO -- The board of Bramalea Ltd. is expected to
announce after its meeting this morning that Benjamin Swirksy
will resign as president and chief executive, according to a
source close the company.
   It is expected that Mr. Swirsky's replacement will be
Marvin Marshall, president and chief executive of Cullen
Center Inc., of Houston, Texas, an office complex owned by
Trizec Corp., of Calgary, Alberta, the source said.

   Bramalea declined to comment, and Mr. Marshall couldn't be
reached for comment, although a source indicated that he is
in Toronto today.
   At the board meeting, Mr. Swirsky is expected to be named
vice chairman of Bramalea. He will remain a director and a
member of its executive committee, but he won't have an
active role in the company's day-to-day operations. It is
expected that Mr. Swirsky will be appointed to the board of
Carena Developments Ltd., and have a senior advisory role
with that concern.
   Bramalea is a real estate concern based in Toronto. It is
66%-owned by Trizec, which is controlled by Toronto
financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman through Carena. Trizec
also is 36%-owned by the Reichmann family's Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., of Toronto.
   Analysts view Mr. Marshall's appointment to the head of
Bramalea as a sign that Trizec will exert more influence on
Bramalea's business decisions. From his experience in
Houston, Mr. Marshall knows how to operate in a tough real
estate market, and Bramalea likely will need that kind of
management, analysts said.
