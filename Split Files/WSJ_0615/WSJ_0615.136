   Federal Express Corp., in moves to bolster its overseas
operations, said it acquired a French trucking company and
initiated air service that connects Asia, the Middle East,
Europe and the U.S.
   Federal Express, the giant Memphis, Tenn., air-express
carrier, said it is buying Transports Transvendeens
Chronoservice, which has annual revenue of about 178 million
francs ($31.2 million). Terms of the purchase weren't
disclosed.

   Federal said the company employs more than 400 people in
14 facilities in France. It has 250 trucks and vans and
operates a next-day trucking service as well as an
international and domestic express business.
   The expanded air service, Federal said, will originate
three times a week in Taipei, Taiwan. The company has
previously provided direct service between Asia, the U.S. and
Europe, but had never provided scheduled flights connecting
Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
