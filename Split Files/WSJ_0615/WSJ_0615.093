   Spooked by late afternoon rumors of a collapse on Wall
Street, London shares finished near the day's worst levels
amid moderate trading.
   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks advanced firmly, paying little
regard to steady profit-taking. Traders said that buyers were
enticed by bargain prices and speculative plays, while a
stronger bond market lent underlying support to stocks.

   Dealers in London said shares there powered ahead
throughout most of the session on a combination of a stock
shortage in the blue-chip leaders as well as robust demand
for stock-index futures.
   But talk late in the day that shares in a major U.S.
computer mainframe maker had been suspended on Wall Street
sparked a sell-off in London, bringing with it talk of
imminent doom and gloom, some market professionals said.
   However, a handful of traders said the market's slide
after several sessions of gains wasn't a worrisome
development. Some traders even said that the broad-based
index's ability to close above 2400 points was a healthy
signal.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
2.4 points to 2403, well below the midmorning peak of 2430.5
and just a shade better than the late afternoon low of
2401.9.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped 4.6 points to
1928.6. Volume was 554.2 million shares, compared with 611.2
million shares Wednesday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2436, slightly better than Wednesday's 2431.5.
   As a sector, brewers were hit on news that the European
Community completed a review of the European beer market that
could have serious implications for the brewing industry in
the U.K.
   Allied-Lyons shed 8 pence to 506 pence (14 cents to
$8.66), Guinness dropped 14 pence to 788 pence, Grand
Metropolitan slipped 5 pence to 667 pence, Whitbread lost 9
pence to 451 pence, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle dropped 3 pence
to 334 pence. Against the negative trend, Bass advanced 8
pence to #10.93.
   Cable &amp; Wireless retreated 13 pence to 556 pence, while
Racal Electronics lost 12 pence to 200 pence and Racal
Telecom dropped 24 pence to 346 pence. All three companies
disclosed full-year earnings a day earlier, and the market
sold the stocks yesterday on further consideration of the
earnings, dealers said.
   Elsewhere, Burmah Oil gained 16 pence to 635 pence, as
traders said the stock has lately been oversold. Market
makers also reported difficulty in purchasing the shares to
meet fresh buy commitments, pushing the price higher.
   Ranks Hovis McDougall rose 6 pence to 371 pence amid
hearty volume of 1.1 million shares. Dealers said talk
circulated that the Agnelli family of Italy was negotiating
to buy the 29.9% stake held in the U.K. food maker from
Sunningdale Holdings Ltd., a consortium that includes Sir
James Goldsmith.
   Banks were out of favor, dealers said, as a clutch of
downgrades continued to hit the market ahead of the sector's
interim earnings this month. Barclays dropped 7 pence to 398
pence, Lloyds lost 10 pence to 289 pence, Midland shed 9
pence to 300 pence, while National Westminster fell a penny
to 349 pence.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 296.34 points to
32668.11. Market sentiment wasn't enthusiastic, however, with
mostly professional participation dominating activity.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 8.10 points to
close the morning session at 32676.21.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
450 million shares, up slightly from 427 million shares on
Wednesday. Advancers outpaced decliners 622 to 320, while 181
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section rose 21.56 points, or 0.91%, to 2399.97.
   The second section index rose 19.87 points, or 0.49%, to
4105.99. Volume was estimated at 26.68 million shares, down
from 29.78 million shares.
   Traders said impressions that U.S. economic data disclosed
Wednesday will come to reflect better conditions for Japanese
equities in the intermediate term carried the market higher
yesterday.
   Dealers bought the market higher in the early session,
with profit-taking continually checking gains, traders said.
But in the afternoon, a spark of index-related buying gave
the Nikkei Index an additional boost.
   Further support from buying on speculative issues and some
institutional buying helped prices maintain gains despite the
constant selling pressure, traders said.
   Unexpectedly low U.S. retail sales for May, down 0.7%,
marked the first time that there have been three consecutive
negative monthly sales figures since September-November 1981,
during the most recent U.S. recession.
   "The fact that retail sales have fallen for the third
month in a row means that the {U.S. Federal Reserve} may be
getting nervous about a recession, and could eventually ease
up on credit" policy, noted Kevin Haag, a trader in overseas
operations at Nomura Securities Co.
   The promising outlook invited a handful of institutional
investors to pick up bargain buys for long-term portfolios,
observers said.
   Many electrical shares were attractive, after repeated
rounds of profit-taking have blunted prices, traders said.
But much of the buying was done by dealers, dipping in to
short-term opportunities on speculative issues and market
news-linked shares.
   A story that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry raised its prediction for private electrical power
consumption through the year 2000 "was a good excuse for
short-term range trading," one trader said, as the electrical
power sector benefited from the interest.
   Kansai Electric closed at 3660 yen ($23.66), up 130 yen.
Tokyo Electric Power rose 100 yen to 4630 yen.
   Talk that Nippon Columbia will market a new, high-grade
compact disk player gave the stock a healthy amount of
interest. The stock rose 70 yen to 1490 yen.
   In addition, talk that certain electronics companies
intend to raise their earnings forecasts encouraged
speculative interest.
   Akai rose 40 yen to 1100 yen, while Hirose added 50 yen to
6830 yen.
   Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Wellington and Manila,
mixed in Hong Kong, and lower in Sydney, Taipei, Singapore
and Seoul.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Paris, Milan and Brussels,
lower in Stockholm and Madrid, and mixed in Zurich and
Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed sharply lower.
