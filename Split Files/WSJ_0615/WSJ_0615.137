   NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved lower as nervousness about
corporate earnings rattled a market already worried about an
imminent flurry of economic data and the quarterly expiration
of stock-index futures and options.
   Earnings-related selling sent both United
Telecommunications and Digital Equipment lower in heavy
trading and continued to depress bank stocks, which paced the
market's retreat.

   Blue-chip issues were spared the worst of the selling and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped just 1.48 to
2928.22; Wednesday's closing figure was revised to 2929.70.
By comparison, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index posted the
equivalent of a 15-point loss in the 30-stock average by
falling 2.00 to 362.90.
   Among other measures, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index dropped 1.02 to 197.98 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index fell 1.89 to 337.93. Declining issues
outpaced advancers on the Big Board by 917 to 560.
   Trading activity slowed to a crawl during the afternoon as
market participants set their sights on today's economic
data, especially the May consumer price index, and the
"triple witching hour" closeout of June index futures and
options contracts.
   Volume on the Big Board dropped to 135,770,000 shares from
158.9 million Wednesday. "A lot of institutions are on the
sidelines, for fear of getting into the market," said
Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities.
   Three key pieces of economic data besides the consumer
price index are also due today: the April trade deficit and
figures on May industrial production and capacity
utilization.
   Stocks slipped at the opening although the report on May
producer prices met expectations, with the index going up
0.3% overall and 0.2% excluding food and energy prices, which
tend to be volatile.
   The market then retreated to session lows at late morning
following word from Digital that analysts' earnings forecasts
of $1.60 to $1.80 a share for the quarter ending this month
"would appear to be too optimistic."
   Futures-related sell programs related to stock-index
arbitrage, involving the purchase of index futures and the
sale of baskets of stocks, hit the market briefly as the
industrial average skidded to a loss of more than 22 points.
   Analysts have been expecting that earnings for the current
quarter would be below year-ago levels, as they were in the
first quarter. Net income for the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 was
down 18% in the previous period.
   But Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., says earnings disappointments for the
second quarter could be more widespread, based on evidence
that economic weakness "is almost in all sectors."
   S&amp;P 500 earnings for the quarter are likely to be 15% to
20% lower than a year earlier, he says, adding that the
market is probably "in for rough sledding over the next
couple of months as companies are going to report terrible
earnings."
   United Telecom skidded 3 1/4 to 40 7/8 in Big Board
composite trading of 4.3 million shares -- eight times the
stock's average daily volume -- after both PaineWebber and
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette lowered earnings estimates for
the second quarter, this year and next year.
   PaineWebber analyst Jack Grubman said he had been
expecting the company's second-quarter revenue to increase 5%
to 6% from the first-quarter level, but now anticipates a 3%
to 4% rise as the result of slower-than-expected revenue
growth at its US Sprint long-distance unit.
   Also, Donaldson Lufkin analyst Joel D. Gross said the
company's first-quarter revenue was lower than expected,
leading to a "ripple effect" over subsequent quarters. He
expects revenue to be up 5% on a quarter-to-quarter basis in
the current period.
   Digital, which also said its profitability isn't meeting
expectations, retreated 1 3/4 to 86 3/8 as 1.2 million shares
were traded. The company didn't provide an earnings
projection for the quarter.
   Bank stocks dropped across the board for the second
session in a row amid jitters about the potential impact of
loan problems on their earnings. Among major-city issues,
Citicorp went down 1/2 to 23 1/8 on 1.3 million shares,
BankAmerica lost 7/8 to 31 1/8 and J.P. Morgan dropped 3/4 to
36 1/2.
   Chase Manhattan dipped 5/8 to 24 5/8; the company said it
is considering selling assets and paring some of its
activities.
   Security Pacific fell 1 to 39 3/8 and Wells Fargo lost 3
3/8 to 78 1/4 after Moody's Investors Service lowered ratings
on debt issues of the two bank holding companies. The agency
cited concerns about their real estate and leveraged buy-out
loans.
   As for other regionals, NCNB skidded 2 1/2 to 37 7/8, MNC
Financial slipped 3/8 to 14 3/4, Banc One fell 1 1/8 to 29
5/8, Citizens &amp; Southern lost 3/4 to 25 and Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group dropped 1 1/2 to 20 3/4.
   Precious-metals stocks were hit with selling after the
price of gold dropped below $350 an ounce. Homestake Mining
dropped 1 to 15 3/4, Hecla Mining fell 5/8 to 11 1/8, Placer
Dome dropped 1/2 to 13 3/4, Newmont Gold tumbled 1 1/2 to 36
5/8 and ASA lost 1 3/8 to 43.
   Wendy's International rose 3/8 to 7 1/4 and peaked at 7
3/8, a 52-week high; more than three million shares changed
hands as the recent burst of activity in the stock
accelerated. Recurring rumors that PepsiCo may be interested
in buying the fast-food company have spurred interest in the
stock, traders said. Wendy's declined to comment on the
speculation.
   Dividend-related trades swelled volume in Empresa
Nacionale de Electricidad, which closed unchanged at 22 1/2
on three million shares, and British Airways, which ended
unchanged at 37 1/4 on 2.7 million shares. Both companies
will make their next quarterly payouts to shareholders of
record today.
   Gillette gained 1 3/8 to 58 1/4. Kidder Peabody upgraded
its investment rating on the stock to the firm's highest
level, reflecting better-than-anticipated sales of the
company's Sensor razor in its first four months on the
market.
   Kellogg dropped 1 5/8 to 69 3/8 after Goldman Sachs took
the stock off its list of recommended issues. Analysts said
the company now expects U.S. cereal shipments for the second
quarter to be down about 15% from the year-ago level,
compared with an earlier projection of a 10% decline.
Separately, Goldman repeated a buy recommendation on General
Mills, which rose 1 1/4 to 84 1/4.
   Lone Star Industries rose 1/2 to 10 1/8. The company
agreed to sell all of its preferred-stock holdings in Tarmac
America, the U.S. unit of Britain's Tarmac PLC, back to the
subsidiary for $147 million.
   Amcast Industrial lost 5/8 to 9 1/2. The company reported
that net income for the fiscal quarter ended June 3 dropped
8.4% from a year earlier.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.74
to 364.30. Volume totaled 10,840,000 shares.
