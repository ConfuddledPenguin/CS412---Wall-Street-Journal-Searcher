   Citing higher margins and lower interest charges, the
Dutch food retailer Koninklijke Ahold N.V. said net income
for its first quarter ended April 22 rose 43% to 67.8 million
guilders ($35.7 million) from 47.4 million guilders a year
earlier.
   The company also said that although earnings growth in
subsequent quarters this year isn't likely to match the
fiscal first-period rise, "we maintain our expectations that
net earnings for the full year will be considerably higher
than in 1989, barring unforeseen sharp fluctuations of the
exchange rate of the dollar." In fiscal 1989, Ahold earned
194.6 million guilders. Ahold declined to specify its
expectations for fiscal 1990 earnings growth.
