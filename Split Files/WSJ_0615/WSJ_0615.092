   NEW YORK -- Exxon Corp., New York, said it agreed with the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to comply
with state air pollution laws by October, or spend upwards of
$30 million on new equipment.
   Under the pact, Exxon would reduce emissions from its
Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., to 30 pounds or less an
hour, from current levels of about 45-to-70-pounds of mineral
dusts, sulfuric acid and sulfates. About 4.2 million gallons
of gasoline and 200,000 gallons of fuel oil are produced at
the facility daily.

   New Jersey state officials said that "Exxon's record of
non-compliance with anti-pollution regulations dates back 10
years." State officials also said the oil concern has paid
fines for non-compliance in the past two years.
   A spokesman for the company confirmed that it has paid
fines in the past for failure to comply, but said that the
non-compliance was unavoidable and "no attempt was made at
anytime to try to do anything surreptitiously." Exxon is
currently performing maintenance work at the Bayway facility
in an effort to meet "stringent New Jersey standards" by the
October deadline.
   The spokesman added that the company is prepared to
design, engineer and construct within 2 1/2 years -- at a
cost of over $30 million -- a new system that will meet New
Jersey standards, if the company cannot renovate existing
equipment to meet those standards.
