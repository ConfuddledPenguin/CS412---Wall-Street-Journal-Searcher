   DAYTON, Ohio -- Krug International Corp. said it sold its
British waste-handling equipment subsidiary, Shelvoke
Dempster Ltd., to the unit's management, completing the
parent's divestiture of its industrial businesses.
   Krug declined to disclose the sale price, but said Lloyds
Bank provided the financing. The company has two remaining
businesses, a biotechnological research and test equipment
line, and a consumer products operation that makes housewares
and garden products, and distributes marine equipment. Krug
previously sold a U.S. waste-handling equipment business and
a power and control business.
