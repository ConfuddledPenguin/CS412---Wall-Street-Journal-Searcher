   PARIS -- In an apparent challenge to the French
government, Cie. Generale d'Electricite acquired majority
control of the nuclear power plant builder Framatome S.A.
   Just last week, President Francois Mitterrand authorized
aides to pursue a plan for government entities to acquire
majority control of the strategic company, in effect
nationalizing it, to keep it out of CGE's hands.

   CGE Chairman Pierre Suard stressed that he still is
willing to negotiate with the government and that "this
doesn't presage the future." Aides to Mr. Mitterrand
downplayed the purchase, saying they had expected CGE to
acquire temporary control and that negotiations will
continue.
   But Mr. Suard said he hasn't agreed to give up control of
Framatome. He said he doesn't know of any other industrial
group capable of overseeing the nuclear power plant builder,
and that if possible he now intends to run Framatome as a CGE
subsidiary.
   "I am very happy with the current situation," he said. "I
won't seek to change that situation unless I receive a
proposal."
   People close to Framatome said they think Mr. Suard
acquired the shares to improve his bargaining position and
get a higher price when it comes time to sell -- an
allegation Mr. Suard rejects.
   "This may make things more difficult, but it won't change
the final outcome," said a person close to Framatome, whose
management supports the president's plan as a means of
remaining independent.
   Socialist members of parliament reacted angrily to Mr.
Suard's acquisition. Several said yesterday that, if a
negotiated settlement isn't reached, they will propose a law
requiring that the majority of Framatome shares be government
controlled.
   The squabble heated up in March, when CGE reached its
initial agreement to acquire a 12% Framatome stake from
construction company Dumez S.A. CGE already had 40%, and the
Dumez stake pushes it to 52%, permitting it for the first
time to run the company. Mr. Suard announced yesterday that
he had completed that much-delayed transaction, which was
initially to have been completed in April. He claimed he
didn't intend to change Framatome's management or undo its
basic policies.
   The government electric company and the Atomic Energy
Commission together hold 45% of Framatome, and the remaining
3% belongs to employees. Until now, that had left Framatome
independently managed, suspended half way between the
government and the private sector.
   CGE makes telephone equipment, trains and heavy electrical
equipment, and in that last capacity supplies extensive
equipment for Framatome projects. But Framatome's
independent-minded chairman, Jean-Claude Leny, and Mr. Suard
never have gotten along. Mr. Suard, for example, criticizes
the joint venture Mr. Leny negotiated with West Germany's
Siemens AG, which Mr. Suard says disadvantages CGE. Mr. Suard
long has said that, to have sufficient clout in its
international dealings, Framatome needs to be part of a large
industrial group -- CGE.
   For France's Socialist president, Framatome is a national
asset that mustn't become the subsidiary of a non-government
group like CGE. France is 70% dependent on nuclear power --
the highest dependence level in the world -- and the
government wants a strong say in the company that builds the
power plants. With Mr. Suard considered close to the
opposition Gaullist party, the president doesn't consider him
a good choice to run the company.
   Prime Minister Michel Rocard has been trying to negotiate
a compromise under which Mr. Suard would sell down to a more
palatable 50% stake in Framatome, and be allowed to run the
company. But the president instructed aides last week to seek
a solution under which the government would take 51% and
Framatome would remain independent. Government-owned bank
Credit Lyonnais currently is trying to put together a
government-led investment group to buy into CGE. Mr. Suard
wouldn't say under what terms he might sell, nor would he say
whether he would be willing to remain as a minority holder in
a government-controlled Framatome.
   CGE said it acquired the Dumez stake under the terms
initially agreed. In exchange for the 12% of Framatome, it is
giving Dumez a 66% stake in its subsidiary CGE-Distribution,
France's third-largest electrical equipment distributor. CGE
is to keep a 34% stake, giving it the right to block any
undesired moves by Dumez. CGE also is making a financial
payment to Dumez, but it declined to disclose the amount.
