   SCARSDALE, N.Y. -- All went well at first when Japanese
executives began moving into this leafy New York suburb,
which writer Diana Trilling once called "the nerve-center of
progressive middle-middle-class America."
   The children of the Japanese who came here in the 1970s
attended the local schools, learned English and made American
friends. Scarsdale school kids were delighted to have
classmates from an exotic and faraway land.
   But as the number of Japanese increased, the atmosphere of
comity began to change. Today, 17% of Scarsdale High's
students are Japanese, and resulting problems have led the
school to form a "prejudice reduction committee."
   The Japanese students now socialize mainly with each
other, make fewer American friends, learn less English and
lock themselves into a self-reinforcing segregation. The
American students complain that the Japanese ruin the
mathematics grading curve, and they seem to view the Japanese
as an alien and somewhat threatening force.
   "There's always this feeling: I don't know what they're
talking about," says Torie Sewell, a 15-year-old sophomore.
"Maybe they're talking about me. Maybe they're saying they
hate Americans."
   As the U.S. and Japan move into an era of shared world
leadership, the young people in both countries will be
leading the way. In some respects, they offer great hope.
They are free from the scars of World War II that distorted
relations between their parents and they share the great
global pulse of popular culture.
   Yet while the world is shrinking under the influence of
satellite television, jumbo jets and fax machines, visits
with dozens of young people in both countries suggest that
the chasm between the two cultures is as wide as ever --
maybe wider.
   Many young Americans share their parents' concerns about
their nation's status in the world, but aren't always
inspired to do much about it. Japanese young people,
meanwhile, seem more overtly nationalistic than their elders,
and more resentful of the U.S. and what they see as its
bullying ways.
   Even Shintaro Ishihara, the Diet member whose
anti-American statements have made him the current "bete
noir" of U.S.-Japan relations, is surprised by Japanese young
people. "Japanese teen-agers," he warns, "are much more
dangerous than me." Kenichi Takemura, a popular Japanese
television commentator, observes: "The youngsters have not
experienced the bombing by B-29s. The war does not live in
their minds. So they get the idea Japan can be arrogant."
   A surprising sign of changing attitudes among Japan's
younger generation can be seen in a Wall Street Journal poll
in Japan that asked: "In the unlikely event your country were
to go to war in the future, which country do you think would
be the most likely opponent." Just over 10% of respondents
over the age of 50 said the U.S. However, that figure rose to
25% for respondents under the age of 30.

   Housed in a sprawling old brick building, Scarsdale High
School might seem insulated from the economic concerns of the
outside world. But its students are clearly attuned to the
shifting fortunes of the U.S. and Japan. American students
make quips in the hallways about Japanese imperialism. And
many students here, Japanese and American, feel Japan has
already surpassed the U.S. in economic power.
   "It will be said in a gibing tone -- `Oh, the Japanese are
taking over America,'" says Ms. Sewell, an outgoing young
woman with straight blond hair. "But you can also see the
seriousness in it."
   "The Japanese are so obvious in what they have," says
Chris Lopez, a junior. "You see Japanese cars all over the
world. People feel resentment. We're Americans. We're
supposed to have everything. And when they stay off by
themselves, people say, `They think they're better.'"
   Such resentment seldom surfaces in blatant acts of
discrimination, but it sets a subtle tone for relations
between the two groups. "It's difficult for the Americans to
figure out what the Japanese are thinking," says Brian
Fisher, a senior at the school. "They really isolate
themselves." Mr. Lopez says the general attitude of his
friends is that Japanese students "aren't fun. They're not
easy to get to know."
   For their part, the Japanese complain of a subtle
prejudice. "I'm trying not to think it's because of racism,"
says Takuma Hayashi, a senior who has lived in the U.S. since
fifth grade. "I'm trying to think it's lack of
communication."
   "It's really a lack of our efforts and a lack of their
consideration toward our problems," says Yuki Yamabe, another
Scarsdale High student.
   Many of the Japanese students, especially the girls, are
also under pressure from home to steer clear of American
ways. "The girls' parents don't want them to become
Americanized," says Kaori Aoyama, whose father was even
unhappy that she got her ears pierced. "Most of the girls'
parents are worried about sex. They want us to be Japanese
ladies. They never say, `Don't associate with American
students,' but they do always remind us: `You are Japanese.'"
   In some ways, the nature of American education baffles
Japanese students. In social studies classes, they are called
on to express and defend opinions, something that seldom
happens in Japanese schools. In science, says Naomi Morii,
who has a son in the 10th grade, "they do lots of
investigation, go to the zoo, do experiments. In Japan, the
teacher gives information, and you study and memorize."
   Homework takes much longer for the Japanese because they
have to look up so many English words. And on top of their
regular studies, most also attend some sort of after-school
Japanese program to prepare for Japan's rigorous
college-entrance exams.
   Their reaction to these conflicting demands is to redouble
their efforts. As a result, their teachers say, many Japanese
show up bleary-eyed and groggy from studying late into the
night.
   "All the American teachers say, `Don't work so hard. Stop
after two hours. You're going to break your health,'" says
Ms. Yamabe. "But if we don't work hard, we won't get the
grade and won't get into college. If I stop after two hours,
there's nothing on the paper."
   These study habits reinforce their isolation. "I tried to
make American friends, and I did, but the life is so
different," says Ms. Yamabe. "After school, they can play. If
they ask me to stay over at their house, I can't because I
have homework. And so I started to lose my American friends."
   That hard work is yet another source of irritation among
the American students, who aren't willing to quit the
football team or the debating team to put in the extra hours
on studies. And when it comes to mathematics, the Americans
figure even extra hours wouldn't be enough. The Japanese
students come to Scarsdale with a much more intense math
background. "They seem on such a higher plateau in math,"
says Ms. Sewell. "It's like, they're so much better, why even
bother?"
   "There's a kid in my class who literally sleeps through
class -- and he gets A's," chimes in Mr. Lopez.
   This defeatism seems to be reflected in the students'
views on broader issues, like American competitiveness. "I'm
not willing to make the sacrifice that it would take to be
No. 1," says Mr. Lopez. "Working long hours without pay,
sacrificing yourself for your country -- that's not worth
it."
   "A lot of people feel that way," says Ms. Sewell. "But
they still don't like it when the people that are beating us
are right next door."

   Unlike American culture, with its celebration of the
rugged individualist, the Japanese ethic has emphasized
suppression of individual desires for the good of the group,
the company, the nation. These days, though, "kojinshugi" --
individualism -- is a word heard more and more, and almost
always in reference to younger people, such as Hiroya Kanda.
   On a rainy Saturday afternoon, he sits with two friends in
a stylish coffee shop in downtown Tokyo. The three are
dressed for tennis.
   "Younger people are really different from the older
generation," says Mr. Kanda, a 29-year-old manager at the
LongTerm Credit Bank of Japan. Until a few years ago,
Saturday was a workday at the bank, and Sunday the only day
off. Now, while Mr. Kanda still works as late as 7 or 8 p.m.
during the week, his Saturdays and Sundays are free. The
nature of that free time has changed too. His elders might
spend their leisure time playing golf with colleagues or
business partners, but Mr. Kanda says he avoids golf because
it reminds him too much of work. His preference: tennis or
touring the countryside.
   Unlike many older Japanese, who take an "it can't be
helped" attitude toward Japan's cramped standard of living,
Mr. Kanda fantasizes about a better life. "I think Americans
are much richer than Japanese," he says. "They live in larger
houses with pools, tennis courts. Here the companies and the
country may be rich, but the people are poor." The older
generation may have worked for the company or the country,
but Mr. Kanda has a different idea. "I work for myself," he
says.
   His views aren't unusual in today's Japan, where young
people are striving for more freedom. Yukio Okamoto, a
division director at Japan's foreign ministry, tells a story
of one of his young staffers who recently declined an
invitation to go drinking with his boss because "he had plans
to go listen to a new CD with his wife. In my days," Mr.
Okamoto says, "an invitation from a director was a godsend.
You would never turn it down."
   Still, the pull of tradition can't be underestimated.
Japanese young people still work longer hours than their
American counterparts. Most still expect to be with the same
company all their working lives, unable to switch jobs even
if they feel mistreated. And the late trains that leave Tokyo
each evening are still packed full of young men, who spent
the evening on the town with their colleagues rather than at
home with their families.
   "The young are changing, but as they go up into the
corporate hierarchy they get assimilated," says Masahiko
Ishizuka, an editorial writer for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
"The grip of Japan's corporate life style is unexpectedly
strong."
   And even Mr. Kanda, for all his Western sentiments, sees
much about the West he doesn't like. "The ratio of lazy
persons is much higher in the U.S," he says. Moreover, "We
have a longer history than the U.S.A. We should be proud of
our own culture. We must export our culture."
   The paradox of today's young Japanese is that the same
kids who eat up American pop culture -- from McDonalds'
hamburgers to the Billboard Top 40 -- want the world to
recognize the greatness of their own country's culture. If
they are more and more like Americans, that doesn't mean they
necessarily like Americans.
   The older generation was reared in the immediate post-war
years, still bearing the shame of the war and grateful for
U.S. generosity during and immediately after the occupation;
the younger generation, in contrast, seems prouder of Japan's
accomplishments -- and more resentful of what they see as
American hectoring. This sense of national pride bordering on
chauvinism is readily apparent in an evening of eating and
drinking with members of Kyoto University's judo club.
   "We're too subservient to Americans," says Atsuhiro Noda,
a 21-year-old engineering student. "If there's a massacre in
Poland, Japan would be very eager to criticize. But if it's
done by the U.S., Japan would hesitate to criticize. Japan
should have its own stance. Japan should be standing on an
equal footing."
   Masafumi Okuda, the team's 22-year-old captain, agrees. "I
think Japan should have its own military capacity," he says.
"It's abnormal to rely on the U.S." Mr. Okuda thinks the
American troops based in Japan "should be allowed to go
home."
   To be sure, such feelings aren't unanimous within the
group. Koji Kawakami, a 19-year-old sophomore, worries that
with Japan "behaving like a `nouveau riche'" on the world
stage, the U.S. and others will abandon it to isolation. "I'm
not accepting a subservient attitude, but the world situation
doesn't allow a {Japanese} military buildup," he says. But
most of them think their country should occupy a place in the
world as a strong nation, independent of American influence.
   Their attitude is evident even in the sport they have
chosen. Judo requires three grueling hours a day of training,
and those who choose it do so, in part, out of a loyalty to
the traditional Japanese notion that effort is good for its
own sake. Mr. Okuda has a cauliflower ear that is testimony
to the sport's rigors; it's a badge of honor for judo experts
that comes from constantly rubbing against rough floor mats
during matches.
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Noda doesn't have much regard for
American athletes. "Americans are much bigger, so they resort
to power rather than skill," he says. But judo, he suggests
with satisfaction, is a sport where power doesn't count for
much and skill is everything.
   If these judo team members represent the traditionalism in
today's young Japanese, many young women represent change.
Women suffer the most from their country's rigid social and
business structure, and over breakfast at Tokyo's Palace
Hotel, four young career women freely talk about their
frustrations.
   The four currently work for Grey Daiko Advertising Inc.,
an American-affiliated firm in Tokyo. They like the company
because, ironically, it offers them better opportunities than
they would find in a Japanese firm. Yasuko Furuichi, a
28-year-old account executive, supposes that some Japanese
companies may be open to women. But she joined a foreign firm
because "I want to play it safe. I have talked to women in
Japanese companies, and I'm sure I can't survive there."
   Toshiko Tsuchiya, a 29-year-old account executive,
desribes how she once worked for a Japanese travel company.
For three weeks a month, she led tours, doing the same work
as men her age. But during the one week each month the tour
guides spent in the office, she and the other women had to
wear uniforms and serve tea.
   Family pressures are intense as well. Mayumi Honda grew up
in the conservative town of Hamamatsu. Her father doesn't
like her working, and her family is concerned that at the
"old" age of 25, she remains single. "They wanted to have an
arranged marriage for me," she says. "Older people think
that's good."
   Perhaps because of their own frustrations, these young
women are generally sympathetic toward the U.S. in its
sometimes prickly relations with their country. "Sometimes I
wish the U.S. would speak louder" in making trade demands,
says Ms. Furuichi. "The Japanese government won't change
internally. The only way to change is through outside
pressure."
   But they see little hope their society will address the
things that matter most to them, such as the country's
crowded living conditions. "The source of the problem is that
Japanese people are trained not to fight against the
establishment," says Kiyoko Tsujita, a 25-year-old
copywriter.
   If anyone understands the difficulty of meshing Japanese
and American culture, and how that may affect Japan's role in
the world, it is Arseny Besher, a colleague of the women at
Grey-Daiko.
   Mr. Besher is the product of both worlds. Sandy-haired and
unquestionably Caucasian, he nonetheless is a native-born
Japanese. His parents were the children of Russian emigres
living in Shanghai, who fled to Japan after the Communists
took over. Mr. Besher was born in 1962 in Kobe, making him an
official Japanese citizen under an obscure law covering
people born of stateless parents.
   While he is a Japanese citizen, no one in Japan -- except
his childhood nanny -- has ever treated him as a native. On a
recent trip to Thailand, the customs officer at Bangkok
airport asked Mr. Besher why he had a Japanese passport.
   "Because I'm Japanese," he replied.
   The customs officer thought for a second and then asked
why Mr. Besher was Japanese.
   "Because I have a Japanese passport," he replied.
   Mr. Besher thrived in his Japanese grade school, but high
school at a prestigious San Francisco institution was more of
a problem. He arrived speaking only Russian and Japanese, and
he disliked the teachers, whose goal as he saw it wasn't to
educate but to get their students into big-name colleges. Mr.
Besher instead chose St. John's, a small "Great Books"
college with campuses in Annapolis, Md., and Santa Fe, N.M.
In the end, however, he still felt "more alienated in
America," and returned to Japan after graduation.
   Yet Mr. Besher wonders what a world under Japanese
leadership might be like. While Japanese profess allegiance
to democratic values, he wonders just how deep those beliefs
go. In Japan, he says, the appearance of having a certain
attitude can be as important as the attitude itself: "Do you
appear friendly? Do you appear intelligent? Do you appear
democratic? But you don't hear people say someone is really
intelligent. Or really democratic. That's private. There are
aspects of their beliefs they don't choose to share."
   He believes the government tries to discourage young
people from thinking for themselves. The education ministry,
he contends, has made clear for 20 years that it wants
schools to turn out people who can "solve problems" but who
won't "seek answers" -- people who can use math and
linguistics to "contribute to Japan through industry," not as
voters and citizens. Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, he
claims, "want no part of a society where they have to listen
to the masses."
   Mr. Besher says it isn't clear that those bureaucrats and
politicians want a leadership role in the world. But that,
too, could be a matter of appearances. "They don't have to
control the wheel," he says. "But they want to own it."
