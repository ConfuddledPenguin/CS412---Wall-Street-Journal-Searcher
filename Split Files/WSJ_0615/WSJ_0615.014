   STOCKHOLM -- AB Volvo Chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar was
elected chairman of Swedish holding company Procordia AB
reflecting the successful completion of the companies' plan
to combine the food and pharmaceutical operations.
   Mr. Gyllenhammar was one of five new directors elected by
Procordia shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting. The
other new board members included Christer Zetterberg, Volvo's
chief operating officer; Ulf G. Linden, a Volvo director and
close adviser to Mr. Gyllenhammar; Bengt Samuelsson, a winner
of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and former chairman of
Volvo's drug affiliate Pharmacia AB; plus Stig Malm,
president of Sweden's national blue collar trade union LO.

   In December, Volvo and state-controlled Procordia unveiled
a 23.8 billion package of transactions, the biggest corporate
takeover to date in Sweden. The pact called for Procordia to
acquire Volvo's food unit Provendor AB and launch a 15.3
billion public offer for Pharmacia, in which Volvo held a 49%
voting stake.
   After some initial snags, the tender offer for Pharmacia
was completed last month. Procordia obtained acceptances
representing 94% of Pharmacia's share capital and has
commenced arbitration proceedings to acquire the remaining
shares outstanding.
   By accepting newly issued Procordia shares as payment for
Provendor and its Pharmacia stake, Volvo gained a 42% voting
stake in the holding company -- equal to the government's
holding which was nearly halved from 80.5% under the
transaction. That dominant ownership position was underlined
by the reshuffling of Procordia's board.
   Absorbing Provendor and Procordia will boost Procordia's
annual sales by about 70% to an estimated 37 billion kronor
($6.07 billion). The enlarged food and drug divisions will
each rank among Europe's 20 largest companies in their
respective industries.
   In a financial report for this year's first four months
issued Thursday, Procordia said it won't be able to issue a
1990 profit forecast until October. But the 27% surge in
pretax profit for the "old" Procordia during the period
showed the ongoing effects of major restructuring during the
past two years.
   Procordia said profit before tax between January and April
jumped to 753 million kronor from 595 million kronor a year
earlier. Sales in the four months increased 8.7% to 6.8
billion kronor from 6.3 billion a year earlier, the company
said.
   The continued turnaround at drug unit KabiVitrum AB
accounted for most of the profit increase, Procordia said.
KabiVitrum's operating profit in the four months soared 62%
to 412 million kronor from 255 million kronor the previous
year. The drug unit's sales in the period climbed 27% to 1.75
billion kronor from 1.37 billion kronor the previous year.
