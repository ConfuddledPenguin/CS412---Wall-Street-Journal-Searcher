   It looks as if Republican Senator David Durenberger is
about to have his book thrown at him. The Senate Ethics
Committee ended its public hearings this week after Mr.
Durenberger said he wouldn't deny he had violated Senate
rules but claimed his motivations in a book-promotion deal
had not been sinister.
   The Ethics Committee may deal harshly with Senator
Durenberger, partly to show it is no longer a toothless
watchdog. It'd be unfortunate, though, if this action became
a cover for treading more lightly in the ongoing Keating Five
and Al D'Amato investigations, the real tests of whether
Congress is ending its double standard on ethics.

   The charges against Senator Durenberger are serious, but
unlike the other two cases don't raise larger ethical issues.
The Senator was accused of using his paid promotional
appearances for Piranha Press, the publisher of his two
books, as a way of collecting disguised honoraria for
speeches. Those, unlike regular stipends for a column or
radio show, are limited by Senate rules. The circumstances
resemble those surrounding former House Speaker Jim Wright's
infamous junk book. Mr. Durenberger is also accused of
accepting Senate reimbursement for stays at a condo he partly
owned, and backdating documents related to its sale.
   Senator Durenberger's turbulent personal life may have
contributed to this and other unethical behavior. In 1988 he
was rebuked by the Ethics Committee for casually revealing
CIA secrets at a Florida fund-raiser. The Ethics Committee
cannot ignore a consistent pattern of rules violations. It
should, however, recognize that the Senate's tangled rules on
outside income invite evasion. Better that the Senate set an
overall cap on outside earned income from whatever source and
then require full disclosure.
   The Keating Five and Al D'Amato cases are far larger in
their ethical implications, akin to many Goliaths looming
over David. Both cases go to the heart of Washington's
"prevailing community standards." Those dictate that actions
most Americans would view as unacceptable are, if done inside
the Beltway, merely the peculiar customs that the people who
make the nation's laws choose to follow.
   The six Senators -- two Republicans and four Democrats --
are all accused of using improper influence on behalf of
wealthy backers under the rubric of "constituent service."
Senator D'Amato is accused of steering HUD contracts to his
friends. The Ethics Committee is leery of challenging the
right of Members to twist arms and pervert policy on behalf
of contributors; the practice is endemic to the way
Washington works today.
   At least one Ethics Committee member seems to have made up
his mind. Senator Terry Sanford recently told a town meeting
in Statesville, N.C., that the Keating Five "did exactly what
every Senator is called on to do every day."
   That is the legal defense offered by Senator Alan
Cranston, one of the Keating Five. As precedent, he points
out the House Ethics Committee excused Speaker Wright's
blocking of regulatory action against insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls as
merely part of his legislative "technique."
   The Ethics Committee may be tempted to absolve such
"constituent service" as routine, but it may not have the
option. The public, in ever-increasing numbers, is in an ugly
mood over the S&amp;L mess. Polls show the percentage of those
with a positive view of congressional ethics has dropped 10
points in the past year. President Bush scores badly in a new
Hotline Poll on his handling of the S&amp;L crisis, but
Congress's ratings are worse. Only 9% of those polled have a
positive view, 64% are negative.
   It's not surprising that Ethics Committee members won't
finish the Keating Five or D'Amato cases before this fall's
elections. But this gives them a lot of time to mull Senator
Durenberger's closing observation during his speech to the
committee this week: "Public attitudes about political ethics
are changing, and we have to change with them or be swept
aside."
