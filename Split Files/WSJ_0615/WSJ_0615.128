   LISLE, Ill. -- Pansophic Systems Inc., a software concern,
said it signed a letter of intent to sell its graphics
division to closely held Autographix Inc., Waltham, Mass.,
and expects the deal to be completed by July 31. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Pansophic said earlier this week that it planned to
dispose of the graphics business and it established a $27.1
million estimated loss on the disposal. It said that, based
on the "upfront cash and expected future payments" from the
transaction, the reserves are "adequate."
