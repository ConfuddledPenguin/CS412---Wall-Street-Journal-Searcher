   WASHINGTON -- Honeywell Inc. petitioned the International
Trade Commission to halt imports of Minolta cameras with
automatic-focusing devices, charging that these products
infringe Honeywell patents.
   Honeywell's action is a surprising departure from its
earlier advocacy of harmonious relations with Japan. But
Christopher Steffen, Honeywell's vice president and chief
financial officer, said that seeking the ITC action is one of
the few alternatives left for Honeywell to recover "hundreds
of millions of dollars in lost royalties" for its pioneering
work on auto-focusing technology.

   The ITC petition brings further pressure on Minolta Camera
Co., the Japanese maker, to settle Honeywell's separate civil
suit seeking damages for alleged patent infringement, misuse
of trade secrets and breach of contract. The case has been
dragging on for nearly three years in a New Jersey district
court.
   In the suit, Honeywell claims that it confidentially
provided Minolta with information for making auto-focus
modules with the understanding that the Osaka manufacturer
would later incorporate Honeywell-made ones in its cameras.
The suit also charges that while absorbing this know-how
Minolta secretly conducted its own parallel development
effort and, in 1985, introduced products using modules based
on Honeywell technology.
   If the ITC accepts the petition, Honeywell could win
relief in 12 months. Honeywell doesn't expect the New Jersey
suit to go to trial until 1992.
   An ITC ruling favoring Honeywell would be a severe blow to
Minolta. The Japanese company's popular Maxxum models, which
feature the disputed devices, account for much of its $1
billion in annual camera sales world-wide. Moreover, the
trade impact could be even broader if Honeywell takes action
against 15 other Japanese camera makers that allegedly
obtained the same technology under similar confidential
arrangements. Honeywell said these firms include Canon Inc.,
Asahi Optical Co., Nippon Kokaku K.K. and Olympus Optical Co.
   Minolta dismissed Honeywell's charges as "baseless,"
claiming that they ignore an earlier history of development
in auto-focus cameras, including "significant breakthroughs"
by Minolta. "As we have argued in federal court -- the proper
forum for this dispute -- we believe the Honeywell patents
claims in question are invalid and unenforceable," the
company said.
   "Honeywell, which does not make or sell cameras, is asking
the U.S. government to prevent Minolta -- and perhaps every
other major camera manufacturer in the world -- from selling
cameras in the U.S.," Minolta said. The company also charged
Honeywell with attempting to breach a 1988 agreement to
confine the dispute in the New Jersey court.
   Honeywell's complaint is likely to resonate in Washington
because of the Bush administration's concern about allegedly
unfair business practices of other Japanese companies.
Honeywell insists, though, that its problems with Minolta and
possibly with other Japanese camera makers are exceptions to
its otherwise productive dealings in Japan. "We've had
technology arrangements with other Japanese companies and
ended up with royalty agreements," Honeywell said.
