   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is investigating
whether to block the sale of a Hercules Inc.
semiconductor-equipment subsidiary to Nippon Sanso KK of
Japan because of concerns the sale will harm national
security and violate antitrust laws.
   The sale of the subsidiary, Semi-Gas Systems Inc., has
sparked controversy in the government and electronics
industry because Semi-Gas is an important supplier for
Sematech, the government-industry consortium formed to help
U.S. semiconductor makers catch up with the Japanese.
Semi-Gas is well-versed in Sematech's proprietary technology
and its plans, the consortium maintains, and could leak this
information to its prospective Japanese parent.

   "The sale will leave us at the mercy of monopolistic
control from Japan," said Rep. Doug Walgren, (D., Pa.), who
chairs a House panel on competitiveness that has looked at
the acquisition.
   Hercules, a Wilmington, Del., chemical and propulsion
company, sharply disagrees. Patrick Womersley, Hercules's
acquisition and divestiture manager, said the sale actually
could help the U.S. semiconductor industry by introducing
Japanese technology into this country.
   Two administration agencies are investigating the proposed
sale. Several weeks ago, an interagency group called the
Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which
reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national
security grounds, started an investigation of Semi-Gas,
according to administration and congressional officials. Of
the approximately 330 transactions the interagency group has
reviewed on a preliminary basis, only 10 have resulted in
such an investigation.
   The interagency group recommends to the president whether
to block a foreign acquisition. But the group interprets
national security narrowly; so far, President Bush has moved
to block only one acquisition: that of a small aircraft parts
producer by a Chinese firm.
   "The linkage to Sematech gives us concerns," said an
administration official involved with the investigation.
"That's an organization put together to help the Defense
Department reduce dependency on foreign suppliers of
semiconductors." The Pentagon contributes $100 million a year
to Sematech, a sum matched by the Austin, Texas, consortium's
14 members. Sematech's goal is to develop semiconductor
manufacturing technology superior to Japan's.
   The proposed acquisition could face a tougher challenge
from U.S. antitrust enforcers. On June 1, the Justice
Department's antitrust division sent Hercules a "second
request for information" consisting of 23 pages of questions
and requests for documents detailing Semi-Gas's sales in the
U.S. and abroad. The request signals that the department is
seriously investigating the transaction; such attention
sometimes causes companies to restructure or even drop deals
to head off formal legal action by the government.
   Semi-Gas is a small San Jose, Calif., company which
produces equipment that routes gases used in semiconductor
manufacturing. These gases are highly toxic and must be
maintained at very high levels of purity. Nippon Sanso, a
Japanese maker of semiconductor gases, agreed in April to buy
the Hercules subsidiary for about $23 million. Semi-Gas has
annual sales of $20 million and controls one-third to
one-half the small U.S. market for this equipment.
   Sematech considers Semi-Gas equipment state-of-the-art.
But Mark FitzGerald, an analyst for the market research firm
Dataquest Co., said that other U.S. firms make equipment that
is equally good. "Nippon Sanso isn't getting a technology
jewel" in Semi-Gas, he said.
   Indeed, Mr. Womersley, the Hercules manager, said his
company owns Semi-Gas's most advanced technology, its
gas-purification technology, and doesn't intend to sell it.
He offered to meet with Sematech officials to assure that
confidential Sematech information won't be divulged to the
Japanese. But Sematech said it remains "very skeptical" that
the protection will work.
   In San Jose, many of Semi-Gas's 120 employees oppose the
sale. A management group tried to buy the company when it
came up for sale, but bid about $2 million less than Nippon
Sanso. Now employees are passing around an unsigned memo
lambasting the deal and accusing Nippon Sanso of wanting to
choke off competition.
   Donald Ramlow, president of a Nippon Sanso
semiconductor-equipment subsidiary in the U.S., declined
comment. But Mr. Womersley speculated that Semi-Gas employees
may be hoping to block the transaction so they could pick up
the company at a lower price.
