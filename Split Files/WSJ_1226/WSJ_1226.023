   WASHINGTON -- Today taxpayers get a late Christmas
present, courtesy of the Internal Revenue Service: a mailbox
that doesn't contain 1990 tax forms.
   In past years, the IRS has let cries of "Scrooge" be
damned and had the postal service deliver tens of millions of
tax forms the day after Christmas. This year, like Ebenezer
Scrooge after encountering a few ghosts, the IRS is allowing
taxpayers to extend their holiday spirits.

   But only for a few days.
   "We've targeted delivery on the 28th to get it a little
further out from Christmas," says Arthur Altman, a 30-year
IRS veteran who oversees the production and distribution of
all those forms. The IRS expects to send out about 97 million
tax-form packages, and another 11 million postcards to those
who last year used forms provided by a professional tax
preparer.
   Moreover, in its struggle to become more user-friendly
under Commissioner Fred Goldberg, the IRS has reworked the
simpler 1040A form so an additional 4.5 million older
taxpayers -- mostly those with retirement income -- can use
it rather than the long form 1040. Unlike previous years,
form 1040A now can be used by people with pension or annuity
income, Individual Retirement Account distributions or
taxable Social Security benefits. Also, those who claim the
tax credit for the elderly or disabled, and those who pay
estimated taxes, can take advantage of the shorter form.
   In another move aimed at making things easier for those
who don't file complicated returns, the IRS has created a
separate instruction booklet for the one-page form 1040EZ,
which can be used by unmarried people. Previously, the EZ
form was contained in the 1040A booklet. This year's EZ form
instruction booklet is 24 pages, while the 1040A instructions
run nearly 70 pages.
   Other changes this year include:
   -- An increase in the standard deduction to $5,450 for
married couples filing jointly; to $2,725 for married people
filing separately; to $3,250 for single people; and to $4,750
for heads of households.
   -- A rise in the income limit for taxpayers to qualify for
the earned-income tax credit. A person who has a dependent
child and who had income under $20,264 can get a credit up to
$953. The income limit for 1989 taxes was $19,340.
   -- The itemized deduction for personal interest falls to
10% of interest paid from 20% on 1989 taxes. This is the last
year such interest is deductible.
   Congress passed several changes to the tax laws this year,
including an increase in the top rate and a cap on itemized
deductions for wealthy people, but those changes don't take
effect until the 1991 tax year.
