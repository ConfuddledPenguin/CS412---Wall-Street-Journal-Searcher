   In your Nov. 23 page-one article on bathtubs, you report
that a certain Hungarian bathtub is made of cast iron two
inches thick and weighs a tenth of a ton. Surely it's
two-tenths of an inch thick. Otherwise, it would weigh more
than a full ton, and would fall through the castle floor.
   Either you've made a metrics mistake, or they're really
building battleships.

   You apparently visited Lilliput and mistook it for
Hungary. A two-inch-thick cast-iron bathtub "weighing in at a
tenth of a ton" would be about nine inches long, nine inches
wide and nine inches deep. Just about right for a
Lilliputian.

   "Nobody makes tubs like this anymore" is an understatement
-- nobody ever did.
   The article brought back memories of a bathtub factory in
Pennsylvania, long closed, where I worked in the early 1950s.
Working conditions were arduous, but the job was interesting
and fun. At that time, stamped-steel tubs were considered
inferior substitutes, and plastic tubs had not begun to
appear. Even today, as the article notes, some people, myself
included, prefer the rigidity and durability of a good
cast-iron porcelain-enameled tub.

   (Editor's Note: The tub's thickness in fact is five
millimeters, or 0.2 inch, not five centimeters, or two
inches. A decimal point apparently was moved in the
translation from Hungarian to metric to English.)
