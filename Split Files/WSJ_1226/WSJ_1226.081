   TOKYO -- For weeks, financial-market rumor mills here have
been buzzing with the story of how a big Salomon Brothers
Inc. bond-underwriting coup was undone. Rival Japanese
security firms, the story had it, pressured the two Japanese
companies issuing the bonds to drop the American firm as the
issue's lead manager.
   It seemed like so many of the rumors that regularly
electrify this city of rumors: Plausible, but unprovable.

   But the rumor gained at least a bit of credence with the
revelation that Japan's Finance Ministry has launched a
fact-finding inquiry. Tadashi Uemura, a Financial Ministry
official, said the ministry is gathering evidence from three
big Japanese brokerage firms "in order to grasp the entire
picture of what has actually happened."
   Mr. Uemura added that "If the decisions were made entirely
spontaneously by the two firms, it is fine. But {we} want to
know if it was the case or not."
   The three brokerage firms are Nomura Securities Co., Nikko
Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Why the Finance Ministry has mobilized to look into this
rumor at this time is one of the many mysteries surrounding
the case. Salomon Brothers didn't complain to the ministry.
Mr. Uemura cited Japanese press coverage, but one of the most
definitive stories to date in the Japanese press, which ran
on an inside page in last week's Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
doesn't directly suggest any pressure or intimidation in the
dropping of Salomon as lead manager.
   One possible explanation is that the inquiry is an attempt
to deflect or defend against attacks from Washington. The
U.S. Treasury recently criticized Japan for not moving faster
in opening its financial markets to foreign firms, and some
Congressmen are eager to pass retaliatory legislation.
   In November, Oji Paper Co. and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.
were firming up plans to issue Euroyen convertible bonds
through Salomon. It would have been the first time that a
foreign brokerage firm had been the lead manager for an issue
of yen-based bonds, and that prospect clearly upset rival
Japanese security firms.
   Most Japanese companies prefer to do business with
longtime Japanese suppliers, much to the frustration of
would-be foreign newcomers. A Swiss banker in Tokyo puts it
this way: If he takes an interesting deal to a potential
American client and the client likes it, he gets the
business. But if he takes the interesting deal to a potential
Japanese client, the Japanese client turns around and
convinces his regular Japanese banker to offer the same deal,
and the Japanese banker gets the business.
   Now, suddenly, Salomon was offering Oji and Fujisawa a
deal, and instead of taking it to their longtime Japanese
underwriters, the two companies were preparing to do business
with Salomon. It's difficult to verify what happened next,
but the rumor is that Japanese securities firms reminded Oji
and Fujisawa of their dependence on them for other services,
like selling their stocks to Japanese investors. If it turns
out that such veiled threats took place in the Salomon case,
Japan's effort to defend its cozy supplier system against
American attacks will have suffered a serious setback.
   The only public hints of such threats up to now have been
extremely tenuous. Through most of the Nihon Keizai story,
for example, the financial newspaper reported that the two
companies had decided to drop Salomon for fear that the bonds
might eventually be used in arbitrage trading. Then came the
final sentence: "There seems to be another aspect as well in
the cancellation," the story concluded. "Japanese companies
can't help giving up the offers, taking into consideration
their relations with Japanese brokerage firms."
   A Fujisawa official declined to comment. An Oji official
said he didn't know the reason why the bond issue had been
canceled.
   In the past, Yamaichi Securities has served as Fujisawa's
lead manager and Nikko Securities as Oji's. It isn't clear
exactly why Nomura is included in the Finance Ministry's
inquiry, although Nomura officials were apparently extremely
critical of Salomon's lead manager role.
   A Salomon official in Tokyo, who declined to be
identified, said he personally spoke to several bond-issuing
Japanese companies, who told him that big Japanese securities
companies had tried to discourage them from using Salomon. He
declined to say whether Fujisawa and Oji were among the
companies he spoke to.
   The official also attempted to play down the whole
incident, suggesting that it was "simply business
competition. It has nothing to do with Japan and the U.S."
   He added: "There's no way for us to know what the Japanese
banks said to issuer companies. Obviously they tried to stop
it. That's no surprise. But threatening -- I don't think
that's the right word."
   All three of the Japanese securities firms denied that
they threatened or pressured anyone. Takashi Yamamoto, a
Nikko general manager, called the charge "groundless."
   Nikko and Yamaichi confirmed that they have been
questioned by the Finance Ministry.
   A Nomura spokesman said the incident has nothing to do
with Nomura, because Nomura hasn't been a lead manager for
Oji or Fujisawa. He said a Nomura executive was misquoted in
a Japanese English-language paper as criticizing the Oji and
Fujisawa deals with Salomon.
