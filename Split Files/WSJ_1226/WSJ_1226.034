   And if This Doesn't Do the Trick,
   They May Call for Squirrel Rifles

   Balloons make good targets.
   Environmentalists have long said balloons that land in the
sea choke marine life. Now California says metallic balloons
do a number on power lines.

   So, starting Jan. 1, Californians who unleash
helium-filled metallic balloons will be committing a crime
under a new law. First-time offenders will be fined $100, and
repeat offenders face as long as six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   The new balloon law results from the lobbying efforts of
California utilities and the state's Public Utilities
Commission. Their crusade was inspired by a commission report
that fugitive metallic balloons and their streamers cause
nearly 1% of California's power outages each year.
   Metallic balloons, on the market since the early 1970s,
are made of aluminum-coated nylon. They stay aloft longer
than latex balloons because the aluminum coating prevents the
helium, which has very tiny atoms, from leaking out. Metallic
balloons account for about $400 million of the nation's $1
billion balloon industry.
   Utility companies were so concerned about the commission's
findings that they wanted to ban the sale of the balloons.
But the Silver Balloon Association, a Sacramento-based group
representing metallic-balloon vendors and manufacturers,
convinced legislators that such a ban would devastate
thousands of small businesses.
   "Squirrels and birds cause nearly 2.5% of the outages,"
says Silver Balloon Director Lisa Rea. "And automobiles and
the weather cause a lot more. But you can't ban squirrels,
birds and storms; so they went after balloons."
   As of Jan. 1, the sale or distribution of any balloon
attached to metallic ribbons or streamers will be prohibited.
Metallic balloons must have a weight attached and bear a
label warning consumers about the dangers that balloons pose
for power lines. And vendors can sell metallic balloons in
bunches only if the balloons are attached to an object, like
a mug or a key chain.
   Still, balloon companies don't seem too deflated.
   Alan Harris, a vice president of M&amp;D Balloons, a large
U.S. balloon maker, thinks the weighted balloons will be
popular. "The new product will prevent a child from losing a
balloon in a grocery store with 20-foot ceilings. And there
will no longer be a need for people to tie their balloons to
their desks or weight them down with a book, only to lose the
balloon once the book is lifted . . . We're optimistic."
