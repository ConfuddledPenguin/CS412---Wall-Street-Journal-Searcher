   Tokyo stocks posted modest losses in razor-thin activity
Tuesday. Professionals were practically the only
participants, traders said.
   In London Monday, share prices also eased in slack
trading. The market was closed Tuesday and today for
Christmas.

   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues shed 351.72
points, or 1.5%, to 23767.88. The index had lost 405.34
points Friday; the market was closed Monday for a national
holiday.
   In early trading Wednesday, the Nikkei Index was up 26.42
to 23794.30.
   Volume on the first section Tuesday was estimated at a
meager 210 million shares, down from 350 million shares
Friday. Declining issues outnumbered gainers 860 to 131,
while 84 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section issues,
which fell 30.55 points Friday, dropped a further 39.65
points, or 2.2%, to 1725.17.
   The Second Section Index, which gave up 41.63 points
Friday, declined 46.40 points, or 1.7%, to close at 2735.24.
Turnover on the second section was estimated at six million
shares, thinning from 8.5 million shares Friday.
   Comments on the day's trading ranged from "totally
incoherent" as dealers repeatedly covered positions purely on
technical factors, to "deathly dull" as brokerage-house
activity dried up because of the yen's weakness and general
holiday sluggishness.
   With so few players in the market, the impact of any move
was magnified. The Nikkei dropped about 250 points early
morning on selling by brokerage houses and then stabilized
until just before the close.
   Leftover profit-taking on the market's early-December
rally picked up toward the end of the day, causing the index
to close at its low for the day. Judging by the Nikkei, the
market rallied nearly 14% this month before hitting
profit-taking.
   Selling related to concerns about Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation last week also continued to
damp sentiment Tuesday.
   Traders said the yen's weakening against the dollar
following the Shevardnadze news is one concern keeping
institutional investors on the sidelines. The greenback,
traditionally seen as a safe investment in times of turmoil,
rose sharply in the wake of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation.
Traders said they see further weakness ahead for the Japanese
currency, particularly in light of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Although long-term interest rates, such as the yield on
the Japanese government long bond, have come down sharply in
the past few weeks, short-term rates are still high. Traders
reiterated Tuesday that unless the Bank of Japan relaxes
monetary policy, the stock market is unlikely to show much
strength.
   Japan's three long-term credit banks will lower the
long-term prime lending rate in January by 0.3 percentage
points to 7.8%, a spokesman at one of the banks said. But
traders said the move won't have much impact on stock prices
unless the central bank subsequently eases credit.
   Shipbuilding, steel, construction, electric power and
other issues that appreciated sharply during the market's
early-December rally continued to be pulled lower by
profit-takers Tuesday.
   IHI shed 19 yen to 666 yen, Mitsubishi Heavy fell 15 yen
to 670 yen and Kawasaki Heavy lost 19 yen to 521 yen.
   Nippon Steel gave up 8 yen to 437 yen, NKK declined 10 yen
to 391 yen and Sumitomo Metal lost 9 yen to 448 yen.
   Sumitomo Construction fell 58 yen to 721 yen, Maeda
Construction slid 60 yen to 1700 yen and Nippon Hodo tumbled
150 yen to 2650 yen. Also lower were Kajima, down 60 yen to
1560 yen, Kumagai Gumi, down 35 yen to 752 yen, Tokyu
Construction, off 50 yen to 1130 yen.
   Tokyo Electric Power fell 100 yen to 3530 yen.
   In London, share prices closed lower in thin Christmas Eve
dealings Monday as further Middle East war talk weakened the
market.
   As expected, trading was unusually thin and many big
players were absent, starting Christmas holidays early,
traders said.
   Nevertheless, it was "one of the quietest Christmas Eves"
in recent years, a trader commented.
   The trader said declines were triggered by weekend Persian
Gulf rhetoric, with U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
suggesting that war was increasingly likely. They said the
impact of his statement was exaggerated by thin market
conditions.
   Falls were limited, however, by the pound's slip to
$1.8745 from $1.8835 Friday, which helped to buoy some
leading international stocks, traders added.
   The broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share
Index closed down 8.1 points at 2156.3.
   The narrower FT 30-Share Index closed down 9.5 points at
1678.9.
   At the final bell, volume was 103.2 million shares. In the
futures markets, the December FT-SE 100-Index contract closed
7 points lower at 2,163.0.
   Among corporate features, water stocks were firm on demand
shortly ahead of their ex-dividend day on Jan. 14.
   Thames Water rose 4 pence (7.5 cents) to 270, Anglian
Water increased a penny to 271, Severn Trent strengthened 3
to 240 and North-West Water rose 2 to 266.
   Shares in the recently privatized regional electric
companies came under selling pressure as personal investors
locked in quick profits. Shareholders were notified in the
last few days about the number of shares they were alloted in
the initial clamor for the issue.
   The package of electricity shares declined 40 pence to
14.60 pounds.
   Traders said that most oil stocks gained from the Middle
East war talk. British Petroleum was up 4 to 339, Enterprise
Oil gained 11 to 610 and Shell was up 6 to 467.
   Elsewhere Monday, share prices closed softer in Brussels,
mixed in Amsterdam and unchanged in Zurich. Other European
markets were closed for the holiday, as was the Johannesburg
market.
   Stocks closed lower Monday in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei
and Seoul. The markets in Singapore, Manila and Wellington
were closed.
   Most markets were closed Tuesday.
