   MOSCOW -- "Lenin must be smiling in a special way," says
the Rev. J.W. Canty. More likely, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,
founder of the Soviet state, was rolling over in his
mausoleum on Monday night.
   Just a few yards from Lenin's final resting place in
Moscow's Red Square, Mr. Canty, an Episcopalian priest from
New York, was reading the Christmas story aloud to hundreds
of rapt Soviets.

   For 70 years, Soviet leadership restricted religious
observances, encouraging people to perform holiday traditions
-- decorating evergreen trees and exchanging gifts -- on New
Year's Day instead. But this year, Americans brought the
Christmas tree and the Hanukkah menorah back to the Soviet
Union.
   Soon after the Soviet Parliament legalized religion in
October, Mr. Canty joined Soviet rock star Alla Pugacheva to
organize Christmas celebrations in Moscow. Such normally dour
institutions as the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and the Moscow
Police Department agreed to help, and 24 American companies
gave almost half a million dollars' worth of donations. The
result is a three-week long "Merry Christmas Moscow" festival
that includes religious services, international gift
exchanges and a series of charity events.
   Working on the assumption that "whatever isn't forbidden
is allowed," 44-year-old Mr. Canty opened "Merry Christmas
Moscow" with a Christmas Eve service right outside the
Kremlin. "Unbelievable," murmured astonished passers-by,
pushing their children forward to listen. Even the Soviet
Navy Marching Band played an enthusiastic rendition of "Oh
Come All Ye Faithful."
   Despite these small miracles, Mr. Canty says recreating an
American-style Christmas in the Soviet Union has been
"tough." General Electric Co. wanted to put lights on the
trees lining Red Square, but the Moscow City Committee on
Shrubs and Trees was worried about foliage damage. "It's just
something they've never done before," shrugs Mr. Canty.
   The difficulties of running a religious holiday in the
Soviet Union are familiar to another New Yorker, Lubavitcher
Rabbi Moshe Chaim Levin. A year ago, his Hanukkah service was
relegated to a small Moscow synagogue. But this year, the
Lubavitchers' huge menorah stands near the center of the
city.
   And Hanukkah was celebrated last Tuesday at Moscow's
Telecenter television and radio station. The Telecenter is
usually a classified building, says Rabbi Levin, but
intervention by Russian republic leader Boris Yeltsin
procured the Lubavitchers "special permission" to use it.
Moscow was linked up to an international Hanukkah
"telebridge." And a standing-room only crowd of Moscow Jews
watched celebrations in Brooklyn, N.Y., as well as in 10
world capitals.
