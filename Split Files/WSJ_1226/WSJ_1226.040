   CLEVELAND -- McDonald &amp; Co. Investments said it expects to
purchase $6.1 million principal amount of its 8% convertible
subordinated debentures, due March 1, 2011, tendered at or
below $70 for each $100 principal amount of debentures under
its Dutch auction tender offer, which expired Friday.
   In a Dutch auction, the price is gradually lowered until
it meets a responsive bid and is sold. Each tendering holder
whose debentures are to be acquired will receive a cash
payment of $70 for each $100 principal amount of debentures
tendered.

   McDonald said the offer was oversubscribed by about
$250,000 principal amount of debentures and will require pro
rata acceptance. It said it expects that about 96% of
principal amount of the debentures tendered will be accepted.
