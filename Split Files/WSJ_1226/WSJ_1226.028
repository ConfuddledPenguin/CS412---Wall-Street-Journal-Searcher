   Michael Milken was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and
Judge Kimba Wood made it clear that she would probably reduce
the sentence if Mr. Milken cooperated with the government. If
it is true, as Mr. Milken has repeatedly contended, that he
did his business in a legal manner for the most part, then he
will have very little to offer the government, and his
10-year sentence will probably stand. But if he was involved
in criminal activity on a large scale, then he can name a lot
of names, tell about a lot of deals -- and he will probably
get a significant sentence reduction.
   Sound ridiculous? Welcome to the real world of federal
criminal law.

   It's usually, but not always, a drug case.
   Congress said it wanted to be sure that drug "kingpins"
got long prison sentences, so it legislated severe mandatory
minimum sentences for drug-distribution offenses. They can be
five, 10 or 20 years, depending primarily upon the amount of
the drug involved. There is less than two months a year
good-time credit allowed with these sentences.
   The only way you can be sentenced to less than the
mandatory minimum is by giving the government "substantial
assistance in the investigation or prosecution of other
persons."
   It does not matter that you are a mother with a previously
clean record and with young children who need you. The mother
will get the mandatory minimum sentence. So will a father who
has been supporting by his hard work a large family for 20
years. So will a college student who was helping a friend and
who had no idea of the seriousness of what he was doing.
Since they are not really involved in the drug underworld,
they cannot help themselves by offering information about the
illegal activities of others.
   But if you are a serious, long-term drug dealer with many
associates and former associates with whom you have done
dozens or hundreds of deals, you can get your sentence
reduced. You may not have to do any time at all. If you are
especially charming and manipulative, the government will pay
you to get the mother or the father or the college student
involved in drug trafficking, and, if you are successful,
that person will get the mandatory minimum sentence. The law
allows the kingpin to walk, and gives unconscionable prison
sentences to poor shleps who made one bad decision in their
lives.
   Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about innocent people
here. I'm talking about people who have been convicted of
drug-trafficking offenses.
   Like the woman in Texas with five children. She drove a
van into Mexico and was arrested at the border when she was
returning home. She said she had no idea there was cocaine in
her van; she said the van belonged to a boyfriend. The jury
didn't believe her. They convicted her, and she got the
10-year mandatory minimum sentence. She was what we call a
"mule." She didn't know about any significant drug activity,
so she couldn't make a deal with the government. What little
she did know, she was afraid to tell.
   In another case the main prosecution witness had three
drug-sales convictions. Whenever he was caught, he decided to
cooperate. After a large amount of marijuana was found when a
search warrant was executed at his home, he decided to
cooperate again. The government didn't even file charges
against him. The defendant whom he set up -- the snitch was
careful to make it legal so there would be no dismissal on
the grounds of entrapment -- had a previous record of only
drunken driving. The defendant is now in jail for 15 years.
The government informant is still on the street, probably
still getting paid by you and me.
   Mr. Milken's dilemma surfaces every day in federal courts
nationwide. The American Lawyer magazine says there are
"hundreds of peripheral players in other people's drug deals"
now serving long mandatory minimum prison terms.
   My clients are poor. Nobody knows who they are, except
their families and friends. This newspaper doesn't write
editorials on their behalf. Growing up, nobody ever told them
that the best chance you have for a light sentence is to be
heavily involved in crime.
   Mr. Milken has the best legal advice money can buy. Still,
I doubt that his family ever dreamed there would come a time
when they'd be hoping and praying that their Michael was a
much bigger crook than they had thought, so he could get a
big reduction in his sentence.
