   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., a pharmaceutical
company, said it received Food and Drug Administration
approval to market an imaging agent that helps to measure
quickly the blood flow to the heart.
   The technetium agent, which will be marketed under the
name CardioTec, is the first such diagnostic agent to receive
FDA approval, the company said. CardioTec, one of the first
of a new class of imaging agents, can help a physician
evaluate within minutes coronary blood flow in a patient at
rest or under stress.
