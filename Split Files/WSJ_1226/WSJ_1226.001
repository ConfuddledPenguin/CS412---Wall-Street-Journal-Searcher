   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks ended an abbreviated
trading session lower Monday, as concerns about the Persian
Gulf continued to dominate the market.
   Volume was the lightest of any session this year as many
market participants took the day off ahead of the Christmas
holiday. Trading ended at 2 p.m. EST Monday.

   Traders say bellicose talk by Iraq's Saddam Hussein kept
the Middle East in the forefront of investors' minds and
contributed to the negative sentiment. On Monday, a Spanish
television station had quoted President Saddam Hussein as
saying in an interview that the Israeli city of Tel Aviv
would be Iraq's first target if war broke out in the Middle
East.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.19, or 0.32%, to 372.41.
On the Big Board, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
was down 0.86, or 0.48% at 180.01, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average dropped 12.37, or 0.47%, to 2621.29.
   Declining Nasdaq issues outnumbered advancers 822 to 641.
   "Nobody wants to invest. There's no heavy selling, but
there's just no buyers," said Robert O'Toole Sr., head of OTC
institutional sales at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
   The over-the-counter market did end above its lows for the
day. In early trading, the Nasdaq Composite was down about
0.50%.
   National Market System volume totaled a meager 35,075,100
shares at the end of trading. Last Friday, 75,944,300 shares
had changed hands by 2 p.m. EST, while for that entire
session, 112,591,800 shares traded.
   Volume surpassed Nov. 23 as the lightest for 1990. For
that day -- the Friday following Thanksgiving -- volume
totaled 41.2 million shares.
   Traders see little chance of any change in the pattern of
trading through the end of the year. "The Middle East is
weighing heavily on everbody's mind," says Len Hefter,
managing director of Jefferies &amp; Co.'s OTC desk in Dallas.
   Mr. Hefter sees the market "moving sideways" through the
New Year's holiday next Tuesday.
   Among active issues were: MCI Communications, which ended
down 1/8 at 19 1/2; Software Toolworks, which slid 1/8 to 3
1/8; National Health Laboratories, which rose 1/2 to 10 1/8;
and Apple Computer, which slumped 1 to 44.
   The American depositary receipts of Reuters Holdings fell
3/8 to 37 1/4. The company signed a letter of intent with the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade
resolving all substantive issues regarding a 20-year contract
for completion of the Globex trading system.
   Index Technology rose 3/8 to 8 7/8, while Sage Software
ended unchanged at 9 1/2. The companies late Friday disclosed
a definitive agreement to merge through an exchange of stock.
   Solectron Corp. rose 3/4 to 8 3/4 after posting
first-quarter net of $1.8 million, or 28 cents a share, on
sales of $53.6 million. In the year-ago period, the company
earned $1.4 million, or 31 cents a share, on fewer shares
outstanding. A year ago, sales totaled $42.2 million.
   V Band Corp. fell 5/8 to 1 5/8. The concern reported a
fourth-quarter loss of 52 cents a share, including a 21
cent-a-share charge. For the year-earlier quarter, the
telecommunications equipment manufacturer had a loss of 29
cents a share.
   Standard Microsystems fell 1/4 to 4 5/8. A U.S. district
court denied the company's request for a preliminary
injunction in litigation against Texas Instruments Inc. The
dispute centers on a 1976 patent cross-licensing agreement
between the companies.
   Infotechnology shares dropped 1/4 to 5/ 16. Late Friday,
Security Pacific National Bank accelerated payments on a
$20.7 million loan to Infotechnology. The loan is
collateralized by the company's 46% stake in Financial News
Network. Infotechnology said it doesn't expect a foreclosure
on the FNN stock. FNN's shares ended bid at 1 7/8.
   Cirrus Logic rose 1 3/4 to 17 1/4. On Friday, Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Drew Peck upgraded his rating on
the stock to "very attractive" from "moderately attractive."
The stock gained 1 3/8 Friday.
   Shares of Corestates Financial Corp. rose 1 5/8 to 30 3/4.
The stock is to be added to the Standard &amp; Poor's Composite
Index of 500 Stocks at the close of trading on Friday. Stocks
generally gain when added to the S&amp;P 500 as portfolio
managers add the issues to their holdings. Corestates will
replace MCA Inc. in the index; MCA is to be acquired by
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   Warehouse Club ended unchanged at 1 1/4 after trading as
low of 3/4. It was disclosed on Friday that Great Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Tea Co.'s planned purchase of a 51% Warehouse Club
stake was terminated. A&amp;P was to have paid $11 million in the
transaction.
