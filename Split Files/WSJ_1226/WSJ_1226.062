   SAN FRANCISCO -- Mayor Art Agnos plans to sign a
watered-down version of a city ordinance that requires
employers to provide health safeguards for employees who work
at video display terminals.
   Mr. Agnos met with business and union leaders last
Saturday and obtained general agreement to support six
amendments that limit the ordinance's scope. The amended
rules will be presented to the Board of Supervisors for
approval by Jan. 7, said Paul Chignell, a mayoral aide. Even
in its more-restricted version, the law, which the mayor said
he will sign tomorrow, still is seen as a possible model for
future legislation in other cities.

   As the use of VDTs has grown, a number of health problems
have been attributed to prolonged use of them. Carpal tunnel
syndrome, a painful wrist ailment; eye strain, lower-back
strain from poorly designed chairs, and concern about the
effects of low-level radiation emitted from the displays have
been the subject of controversy between computer operators
and their employers for a number of years.
   The ordinance requires employers to provide workers with
adjustable seats, monitors and keyboards; sets guidelines for
eliminating screen glare; and requires regular 15-minute
breaks for workers and replacement of substandard equipment.
   Under the amendments the mayor proposed, companies have
four years instead of the originally proposed two years to
replace substandard equipment. Companies will be required to
retrofit substandard computer equipment within 30 months at a
cost of as much as $250 per machine. All new computer
workstations purchased within a year of the adoption of the
Dec. 17 ordinance will have to meet the new standards set by
the ordinance.
   Workers at the Pacific Stock Exchange and operators of
computer-aided design and display machines -- used in
architectural and other design-oriented industries -- are
exempt under the new rules.
