   GORBACHEV WON parliamentary support for sweeping new
executive powers.
   The Congress of People's Deputies voted to create a new
vice presidency and a cabinet under the Soviet leader's
direct control, marking a clear victory for the president and
for hard-liners. Also, Gorbachev quashed an effort by some
legislators to rein in his authority to issue decrees, and he
expressed anger at progressives trying to limit his
authority. On Monday, the Congress endorsed the concept of a
union treaty to hold the country together, and ordered the 15
republics to set dates for holding referendums on the
question.
