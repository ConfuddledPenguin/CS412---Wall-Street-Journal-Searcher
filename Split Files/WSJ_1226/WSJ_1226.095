   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. said the Federal
Communications Commission approved the spinoff of WWOR-TV,
clearing another hurdle on the way to completion of the
company's $6.59 billion acquisition by Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.
   The Secaucus, N.J., television station is being spun off
to MCA shareholders because TV stations are prohibited from
being more than 20%-owned by foreign interests. MCA holders
are to receive an "equity stub" in the station in addition to
the $66 a share they receive when the tender offer is
completed. MCA has estimated the stub to be worth about $5 a
share; holders will receive one share of the new company for
every five MCA shares.

   Analysts believe the station will be sold within a short
period of time. MCA bought it for $386 million in 1987.
   The acquisition of MCA by Matsushita is expected to be
completed anytime within the next three weeks. The Securities
and Exchange Commission still must approve the transaction,
and a hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles set for
Friday will rule on one shareholder suit which hasn't joined
five others in a tentative settlement. The tender offer is
scheduled to expire Friday.
   An antitrust suit filed by Go-Video Inc. seeking to block
the merger is on appeal after a federal court in Phoenix
denied a temporary restraining order. Another shareholder
suit which had claimed that foreign ownership of a U.S. media
company violated the U.S. Constitution was dismissed by a
federal judge in New York last Friday. A call by Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan for a review of MCA's proposed
placement of its Yosemite Park and Curry Co. into escrow
pending its sale isn't thought to be an obstacle to
completing the merger.
