   Japan's Sumitomo Chemical Co. and Nippon Shokubai Kagaku
Kogyo Co. Ltd. agreed to form a joint venture company with
Korea's Lucky Ltd. to produce a raw material for an
industrial resin.
   The three companies said they would build a plant in Korea
to produce an ingredient for methacrylate resin, used to
enhance transparency or weather resistance in items such as
housing materials.

   The plant, scheduled for completion in the spring of 1993,
is capitalized at 24 billion won ($33.6 million). Fifty
percent of financing will be provided by Lucky Ltd.; the rest
will come from the Japanese firms in equal shares.
   The plant will be built in the Lucky Goldstar Group's
petrochemical complex in Yeochun, Korea, the companies said.
The new venture will be called Lucky MMA Corporation.
   The plant will make 40,000 tons annually of the MMA
monomer used in the industrial resin, and 35,000 tons yearly
of isobutylene, MMA monomer's raw material.
   Currently, the materials that the plant is expected to
make are all imported into Korea, as there are no local
producers, the companies said.
   The two Japanese companies, which have been cooperating in
the development of their own MMA monomer operations, run a
joint venture in Japan called the Nihon Methacrylate Monomer
Co.
