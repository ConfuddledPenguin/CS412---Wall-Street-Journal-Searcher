   BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. -- Harold K. Sperlich resigned as
chairman and chief executive officer of PHM Corp., and
William J. Pulte, founder of the home building company,
succeeded him at the company's helm.
   Mr. Sperlich, 61 years old, had been in command of PHM
only since April. Before that he was a private consultant.
Mr. Sperlich is better known as the intense auto executive
who was the driving force behind the development of Chrysler
Corp's. "K Cars" and its popular minivans. He resigned from
Chrysler in 1988.

   Mr. Pulte, 58, will resume control of the company. In
1984, he was part of a three-person office of the chief
executive. Mr. Pulte also had previously been chairman of the
company's executive committee. At the beginning of the year,
he owned 19% of PHM's common stock.
   Neither Mr. Sperlich nor representatives of PHM were
available for comment on Mr. Sperlich's resignation, so the
circumstances surrounding his departure aren't clear.
   Nearly three years ago Mr. Sperlich resigned as president
of Chrysler Motors, after recurring clashes with Chairman Lee
A. Iacocca and with Gerald Greenwald, then Chrysler's
second-ranking executive.
   A statement released with the resignation announcement
said Mr. Sperlich will continue as a consultant to PHM. The
statement quoted Mr. Sperlich as saying, "I am delighted to
see Bill Pulte back in the saddle again, where he belongs."
   For the first nine months of this year, PHM had earnings
of $5.2 million, or 22 cents a share, compared with earnings
of $9.5 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
declined to $822.3 million from $841.7 million.
   PHM shares closed at $9.875, down 37.5 cents in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

   PHM Corp. posted net income of $26 million, or $1.03 a
share, for 1990's first nine months, compared with $40.6
million, or $1.53 a share, in the year-earlier period. The
results were misstated in yesterday's editions.
