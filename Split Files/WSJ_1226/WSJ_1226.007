   NEW YORK -- For the first time since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, the pace of insider selling is picking up.
   Taking advantage of the stock market's recent rebound,
corporate executives, directors and major holders have begun
lightening their holdings of their own companies' shares,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
That's in sharp contrast to the insider-buying spurt that
came right after Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait Aug. 2.

   Until recently, insider buying had been outpacing insider
selling by a 2-1 margin. But that's changing. Buying is still
running ahead of selling for now, but SEC filings for
November show the margin is narrowing.
   "A lot of insiders at good companies were selling into the
November rally," said Bob Gabele, head of Invest/Net, a Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., concern that tracks SEC filings. In fact,
he said, "they began unloading at the first bounce from the
August and September lows."
   Insider selling has picked up particularly in the health
care, oil, real estate and construction industries,
Invest/Net data indicate.
   The selling may be related in part to tax-law changes that
will mean steeper levies next year for some high-income
executives.
   But in general, insiders buy and sell shares based on how
the company is faring and "in reaction to the level of the
stock market," said Donald Baxter, chairman of Baxter
Financial Corp., a Boca Raton, Fla., investment firm. The
recent selling may be related to the fact that "people are
seeing a deterioration of the economy affecting their
businesses," yet shares are trading at higher prices than at
any time since the invasion.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit what appears to have
been its low for the year at 2365.10 in mid-October. Since
then, it has rebounded more than 250 points to close Monday
at 2621.29.
   "Insiders were buying when the market was down and you
couldn't give stocks away," said Michael Murphy, editor of
the Overpriced Stock Service newsletter. Many of them
profited as the market firmed in November. Now, he said, the
insiders may be leading the pack in selling.
   Mr. Gabele of Invest/Net cautions that evidence from SEC
filings is preliminary. But "investors might think there
might be some downside momentum in the market coming," he
said.
   These are some of the companies that experienced clusters
of insider selling recently:
   -- At Boston-based Gillette Co., five insiders sold a
total of 33,000 shares in late October and November, SEC
filings show. They sold at prices ranging from $58 to $61.50
a share.
   Alfred Zeien, president-elect of the company, was the
biggest seller, with a 15,000-share sale at $60.25 a share on
Nov. 30, the filings show. His direct holdings now total
68,900 shares, according to the filings, which show that the
November sale was option-related.
   Mr. Zeien couldn't be reached for comment. A Gillette
spokesman said the sales by Mr. Zeien and the other insiders
were related to "year-end financial planning adjustments."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Gillette
closed Monday at $61.125, up 25 cents.
   -- Three insiders at Geico Corp., including the chairman,
sold shares of the Washington-based insurer in late November,
according to SEC filings.
   William Snyder, chairman, sold 3,000 shares, or 6% of his
direct holdings, on Nov. 29 and 30, the filings show. The
other two insiders sold 3,000 shares between them at $148 to
$163.25 a share, according to the filings.
   Mr. Snyder couldn't be reached for comment. A company
spokesman declined to comment on the transactions. He said
that according to a proxy statement issued by the company in
May, Mr. Snyder had 174,592 shares and options to purchase
additional shares.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Geico closed
Monday at $164.375 a share, up 37.5 cents.
   -- At Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., four insiders
sold 80,666 shares in November, SEC filings show, at prices
of $48.50 to $54 a share. Company officials couldn't be
reached for comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Compaq
closed Monday at $57 a share, up 12.5 cents.
