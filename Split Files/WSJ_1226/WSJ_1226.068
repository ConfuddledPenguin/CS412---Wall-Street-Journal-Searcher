   Clients aren't stampeding to sign up for DDB Needham's
daring compensation plan -- despite the advertising agency's
promise of "guaranteed" results.
   In a proposal it hailed as groundbreaking just last
spring, the Omnicom Group unit offered clients a rebate of as
much as 30% off a negotiated base rate if they agreed to a
long list of tough conditions and if specific results weren't
reached. Clients were to pay DDB Needham a bonus for meeting
those goals, such as specific sales increases.

   DDB Needham presented the compensation idea to its 55 U.S.
and Canadian clients. So far, about five small clients have
enrolled, but not one major company has endorsed the plan.
And rival agencies were skeptical from the outset, deriding
the idea as a publicity gimmick.
   Negotiated incentive and bonus systems have become more
common on Madison Avenue in recent years as a measure of
agency performance and as a substitute for the once-standard
15% commission of a client's ad budget. Agencies rarely try
to guarantee results, however.
   The Omnicom plan "has been a limited success," conceded
Bruce Crawford, Omnicom president and chief executive
officer, after an analysts' presentation in New York two
weeks ago. But "it has had tremendous success in focusing
discussions on agency performance."
   Although the agency's own research suggests nearly 88% of
its clients aren't even interested in the plan, DDB Needham
is now pushing the plan harder among prospective clients.
According to DDB Needham, more than one-third of the
prospects have expressed interest, and the agency, like most
nowadays, needs to use every possible lure to attract new
business.
   DDB Needham President John Bernbach, trying to accentuate
the positive, says he's "real pleased" with would-be clients'
level of interest, adding, "we're ready to go when anybody is
ready to go." Mr. Bernbach says the program should get a
boost next year because the heads of DDB Needham offices in
cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have pledged
to sign up two or three clients apiece during 1991.
   But officials at competing agencies believe the scant
acceptance justifies their initial skepticism about the plan.
"I told {DDB Needham executives} in the beginning" that it
wouldn't work because "they wanted control of everything,"
recalls Philip H. Geier, chairman and chief executive of
Interpublic Group, parent of the McCann-Erickson and Lintas
agencies.
   Among other things, DDB Needham initially insisted that it
be given total, unquestioned control over a client's entire
marketing program -- including work done by outside
public-relations, direct-mail and other unrelated marketing
firms.
   Major clients apparently have resisted the plan because
they feared the loss of established relations with other
marketing services. Notes the chief of one midsized agency:
"It's extremely hard to quantify incentives and to give your
{ad} agency total control of your marketing."
   DDB Needham now may be backing away from demanding
complete control, however. Peter Tate, a DDB Needham account
executive, says that the agency never expected clients to
abdicate their marketing responsibilities, but that it still
does insist that they use solely the agency's creative ideas
in direct marketing and similar promotional efforts. For an
interested company, another DDB Needham account executive
says, "we would try to find a middle ground where the client
could have his vote" in overseeing marketing.
   That's the case with Olympus. Last month, the U.S.
consumer-products arm of Japan's Olympus Optical picked DDB
Needham's New York office to handle the estimated $12.5
million account for its 35mm cameras. Olympus probably will
decide by mid-January whether to adopt the "guaranteed
results" program, says David Willard, the Olympus unit's
senior vice president of marketing.
   But the DDB Needham proposal wouldn't give the agency
total control over marketing the cameras. The issue, Mr.
Willard says, "was never even part of the original
discussions."

   PHONE ADS: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph should drop or
modify its ad claims about "wasted" set-up time for
long-distance calls, the National Advertising Review Board
ruled. Rival US Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications,
had challenged an AT&amp;T ad that claimed: "On average, MCI and
US Sprint take over 50% longer than AT&amp;T to set up long
distance calls. When you multiple that 50% difference by the
number of calls a large company makes a year, it comes out to
hundreds of wasted work hours if you use MCI or US Sprint."
US Sprint said the ruling backed its argument that the claim
was "blown out of proportion." AT&amp;T said it will take the
NARB's concerns into account, but "we will probably continue
to emphasize the speed of our call set-up time." The board,
the appeals arm of the Council of Better Business Bureau's
National Advertising Division, upheld other AT&amp;T claims about
set-up time.
                                                                                                       

   MAGAZINE REVENUES: Total magazine advertising revenues
dropped 1.04% in November from a year earlier, while ad pages
fell 5.46%, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
So far this year, ad revenues were up a marginal 1.44%, but
ad pages declined 3.97%.
