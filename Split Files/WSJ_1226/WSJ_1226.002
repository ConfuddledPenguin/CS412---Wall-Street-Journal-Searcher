   NEW YORK -- Share prices slipped in listless trading, but
few investors participated in the Christmas Eve session,
which ended two hours early at 2 p.m. EST.
   Volume was a meager 57.2 million shares, the lowest since
Dec. 26, 1986.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 12.37 points to
close at 2621.29. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell
1.85 to 329.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
dropped 0.86 to 180.01, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
slid 1.46 to 305.71. Decliners led advancers 842-527, with
560 stocks ending unchanged.
   A growing perception that the Persian Gulf standoff over
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait will end in armed confrontation
combined with new fears of political instability in the
Soviet Union continued to sap the market of its typical
year-end strength.
   Rising long-term interest rates added to the malaise.
Prices of long-term Treasury issues dropped as much as 7/8
point, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond up to 8.36%.
   Sid Dorr, head of institutional trading at Charles Schwab
&amp; Co., said hopes of fresh stock-market gains this week are
dying out. Mr. Dorr said, however, that with cash levels
among portfolio managers at record levels, there is likely to
be plenty of fresh money waiting to be put to work early in
the new year.
   That money could lend the market some support, said Don R.
Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher
&amp; Singer, but Mr. Hays said he isn't looking for any major
gains.
   The margin of advancing stocks over decliners began
eroding last week, Mr. Hays said, signaling that the rally
was growing weak. Now, apprehension about the Persian Gulf is
likely to mute the market's more bullish voices, he said.
   Dividend-related trading boosted Manufacturers Hanover to
the top of the active list, edging out Southern New England
Telecommunications, which was also active in dividend-related
trading.
   Manufacturers Hanover eased 1/8 to 23 7/8 on volume of 2.1
million shares. The bank, which has an 82-cent-a-share
payout, will trade ex-dividend today.
   Southern New England fell 3/8 to 33 1/8 on 1.2 million
shares traded. The company paid a 44-cent dividend to shares
of record Monday.
   Dean Foods gained 5/8 to 39 5/8, a 52-week high. Last
week, the dairy products concern reported strong fiscal
second-quarter profit of 62 cents a share, up from 53 cents a
share a year earlier.
   Tucson Electric Power eased 7/8 to 6 1/2. The utility
appeared to move closer to a bankruptcy-law filing after a
state court ruling raised the possibility that it might have
to take $350 million in immediate one-time charges, The Wall
Street Journal reported.
   International Business Machines was unchanged at 113 7/8.
IBM will introduce its long-awaited laptop computer in late
February. The Journal quoted industry executives as saying
the company finally appears to have a credible product.
   MCA gained 1/4 to 67 1/2. The company received Federal
Communications Commission clearance to transfer control of
its WWOR-TV station to shareholders as part of MCA's
acquisiton by Japan's Matsushita Electrical Industrial.
   Oregon Steel Mills slipped 1 3/4 to 22 1/4. The company
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a
proposed public offering of 2.5 million common shares.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 1.61
to 304.59. Volume slowed to 4,670,000 shares from 13,750,000
Friday. There were 195 issues advancing, 274 declining and
268 unchanged.
   NHI Nelson Holdings International gained 3/4, or 30%, to 3
1/4. The company said it signed a letter of intent to sell
its principal operating unit, Nelson Entertainment Group, to
a new company to be controlled by New York financier Stephen
C. Swid. Terms call in part for the concern to pay about $30
million in cash and notes for the unit and to assume $20
million of Nelson Holdings' debt and about $166 million of
the unit's debt.
