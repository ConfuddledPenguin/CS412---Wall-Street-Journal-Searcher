   TOKYO -- Overshadowing a huddle of grubby pubs and noodle
stalls in a downtown district of Tokyo is a glittering,
pear-shaped blob.
   "I didn't know what to make of it at first," concedes
Yoshinobu Takeda, a spokesman for Asahi Breweries Ltd., owner
of the 150-foot-long structure that sits atop a black
building. Speculation by local residents as to the nature of
the gold-colored blob ranged from a giant beer drop to more
earthy objects.

   Actually, the blob -- symbolizing a flame of passion -- is
the work of Philippe Starck, a French architect. Asahi built
it to mark its 100th anniversary.
   "We wanted a building that people would find interesting
30 years from now," says Mr. Takeda.
   The blob -- or flame, rather -- is just one of some 60
wacky architectural projects recently finished or being built
by foreign artists in Japan these days. More than 40 foreign
architects have flocked to Japan in the past few years.
   Financing the boom are cash-rich Japanese manufacturers,
land developers and restaurant owners striving to boost their
image by replacing their tattered buildings with eye-catching
modern constructions. Just as Japanese consumers are turning
to foreign designers for fashion, many companies are paying
American and European architectural designers to dress up
their buildings.
   "There's a belief that if it's the best, it's got to be
foreign," says Philip Stewart, an international business
manager for PAE International, an American architecture
concern based in Japan for more than 30 years. A higher value
of the yen against the dollar is also making foreign names
more affordable.
   Japan's obsession with design is a major change from its
traditional outlook on architecture, which focused entirely
on a building's practical functions and gave little attention
to individual names and designs.
   Now, in a country with few legal restraints on buildings'
outward appearances (they must be able to withstand
earthquakes) the demand for things bizarre seems endless.
Consider Mazda Motor Corp.'s research center, designed by a
young Japanese architect and expected to be completed next
year. It features a four-story building with mirrored walls
and an oversized Greek column, among other architectural
elements. Or "Via Stagione," a passageway at a Tokyo shopping
center. The work of an Italian team, it has bumpy white walls
covered with a mosaic of broken glass.
   As much as a fifth of Tokyo is rebuilt every five years,
developers estimate. Tokyo "is organized chaos, which {gives}
the architects freedom to express themselves any way they
want," says Shi Yu Chen, an architect and developer who has
worked with Japanese companies seeking foreign architects.
The country has "become a theater for international
architects."
   That means that a designer such as Britain's Nigel Coates
can work on larger projects in Japan than back home in
Britain. "There's a greater need in Japan for a status
attached to an architectural designer," says Mr. Coates, who
now has half of his projects in Japan. "For architects like
us that are more avant-garde, it's very important that we're
given an opportunity to realize our potential to the full
extent." Japan is where that is most possible, he says.
   Five years ago, Mr. Chen spotted some of the creations of
Mr. Coates, then an architecture professor little known
outside Britain, in a magazine. The designer's landmarks
around Japan have spread Mr. Coates' name world-wide. Some of
his bigger works include a bar and disco in a central Tokyo
building with a facade resembling a solid brick wall, with
windows only on the top floor. He put a giant Noah's Ark with
a Chinese restaurant inside it in the middle of a northern
Japanese city.
   "In Europe, we are restricted by what the rest of the city
looks like," says Mr. Coates. "It would be difficult to build
an enormous concrete rock building like Noah's Ark in
London."
   The mass of splashy buildings, however, is a little much
for some. Aldo Rossi, an Italian architect, designed a red
stone hotel in Japan's southern city of Fukuoka, coving the
surface with a criss-cross of red pillars and green
horizontal metal bars. The eight-story windowless hotel
certainly stands out enough to make drunken salarymen gawk as
they sway out of neighboring bars. But amid the blinding neon
signs in a seedy love hotel district, the creation looks
rather miserable, says Yoshiyuki Kitamura, a 43-year-old
Fukuoka architect.
   "If that were built in Italy, it would be a different
story," says Mr. Kitamura, who says he generally has great
respect for Mr. Rossi's works. "Here, it looks as though it
can't communicate in a foreign country."
   Designers on the cutting edge are expanding into interior
decoration, too. Jasmac Co., a Tokyo land developer, assigned
the interior decoration of a bar and restaurant to Zaha
Hadid, an Iraqi-born London architect famous for designing
buildings considered unbuildable. Striving to satisfy the
"ice" theme of the building, Ms. Hadid designed glass dining
tables with corners so sharp that managers worried that
customers would cut themselves. The glass staircase was so
sharp and narrow, says Seiichi Kaga, director of the
building, that a customer fell and put a hole in the floor.
But the restaurant has attracted crowds of young visitors.
   One area that foreign architects are only just beginning
to crack is large-scale public works. Rafael Vinoly, an
Argentine-born American designer, last year won a government
contract to build a 130 billion yen ($960 million) conference
hall in central Tokyo. Renzo Piano, an Italian architect, is
designing the terminal building for the Kansai International
Airport.
   As Japanese companies increasingly try to lure consumers
with aquariums, golf courses and resort hotels, foreign
architects with more experience in those fields than Japanese
counterparts will have an even greater opportunity,
developers say.
   The rush by Japanese companies to hook up with foreign
designers is making some Japanese architects uneasy. Kiyokazu
Arai, a Tokyo architect, says he is inspired by some of the
novel designs of his foreign counterparts. But he is critical
of companies that "don't mind who they get as long as they're
foreign and well-known."
   Some designers question how long Japan's appetite for
wacky buildings will last. "I wonder if people will keep
wanting to be `stimulated,'" says Ittaku Katsuki, chief
producer at Creative Box Inc., a Tokyo design company.
Eventually, he says, "the buildings will also grow up."
