   The familiar curlicued and embossed stock certificate has
long been the financial world's bow to artistry. These proofs
of ownership come in all shapes and colors, some so
beautifully designed that they are suitable for framing,
though they usually end up in safe-deposit boxes.
   In today's 24-hour world of international stock markets,
the new high art is writing the computer software to speed
transactions. Stock certificates are destined to go the way
of carbon paper; for all nostalgia, paperless stock trading
is inevitable. The only question is how soon.

   The key issue is the time it takes to process
transactions. The U.S. now requires five days for the actual
exchange of cash for stock, but industry leaders think that
within a few years the international standard will be three
days. An international group of bankers and brokers called
the Group of 30 issued a report this past summer highlighting
the cost savings from abolishing certificates.
   One part of the problem is that the settlement and
clearance of securities trades has become a two-class system.
Institutional investors do their trades by modem, but retail
customers still rely on the mail. The 1987 stock crash caused
special back-room problems for firms that clear trades
because of the added risk of a high number of unsettled
transactions in a volatile market.
   Among the few voices that have objected to moving toward
paperless securities trading are brokerage houses that want
to keep the float created when customers pay before the
required date. It's hard to imagine that many investors would
prefer having to worry about physical certificates when a
computer entry seems at least as reliable. Mutual funds don't
issue certificates, but haven't found this is any problem
with investors. The U.S. government still manages to attract
even the most old-fashioned investors even though it offers
Treasuries only in book-entry form.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be of two
minds. SEC Commissioner Mary Schapiro has backed the idea,
especially because Europe plans three-day clearances by 1992.
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, however, says he wants
investors to have the option of physical certificates. This
would allow only some of the efficiencies of book entry. One
possibility is to charge a fee to anyone who wants a
certificate, which probably would quickly reduce the number
of certificates.
   We have a compromise proposal. By all means we should have
required computerized entry for stock ownership and trading,
but there's no reason to deprive investors of all concrete
evidence of ownership. Brokerages could send the
confirmations of stock transactions in the form of
computer-generated stock certificates -- curlicues and all.
These would not be legal tender, but sometimes the road of
progress seems easier if you keep an old friend along for the
ride.
