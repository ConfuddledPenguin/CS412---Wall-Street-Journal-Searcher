   Big insurance companies say they plan to sharply cut back
or stop their commercial mortgage lending activity altogether
next year, making the credit crunch in real estate even
tighter.
   By stepping back from new commercial mortgages, insurers
make it more difficult for banks and developers to find
long-term financing for construction loans. Typically,
insurance companies step in after construction on a project
is completed, often replacing a construction loan from a bank
with a long-term mortgage.

   "It contributes to the overall liquidity problem in the
market and over the next few years," says Kenneth Pinkes,
director of financial institutions research at Moody's
Investors Service Inc. Without insurers playing as large a
role, real estate prices could drop further, he said, because
projects are likely to be sold in an already saturated market
in order to pay back short-term bank loans.
   The cutback is sharpest among insurance companies with the
heaviest exposure to real estate. Travelers Corp., with about
$13 billion in real estate, plans to shut off its new
commercial mortgage lending activities next year, a spokesman
said. In October, the company added $650 million to loss
reserves for mortgage and real estate loans.
   Aetna Life Insurance Co. also said it will be cutting back
on its commercial mortgage investments, but a spokesman
declined to say by what amount. Aetna has about $19.6 billion
invested in real estate, equal to about 51% of its invested
assets.
   Even insurance companies with real estate portfolios that
are proportionately smaller than the industry average are
pulling in their horns. "It's a combination of our concern
over security and whether we can get paid enough for the risk
we are taking," said Richard Robertson, executive vice
president of Fort Wayne, Ind.-based Lincoln National Life,
with 22% of its invested assets in real estate.
   Some companies say they are avoiding new commercial
mortgage lending, but plan to add to their portfolio by
buying mortgages from other insurance companies in the
informal secondary market for these investments.
   "We'll be making cold calls on our counterparts at other
insurance companies and telling them we are interested in
buying loans out of their portfolio," according to Scott
Noble, senior vice president at Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co.
   Meanwhile, the company has put a moratorium on new
mortgage lending until returns in that business improve.
These days the company's mortgage lending officers are
spending their time reviewing existing loans and
restructuring the ones that are in trouble, Mr. Noble says.
   Weston Hicks, vice president at Moody's, says he expects
insurance companies to begin investing in mortgage-backed
securities and municipal bonds as a replacement for
commercial real estate. Massachusetts Mutual, for example, is
planning on increasing its purchases from banks of packaged
blocks of single family mortgages by 50% next year to $600
million.
   "It's a 2-for-1 situation for the banks," he says. "They
reduce their real estate exposure and raise capital." For its
part, Massachusetts Mutual believes the loans are high
quality.
