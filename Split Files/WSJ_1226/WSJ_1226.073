   Calton Inc., Freehold, N.J., said it reached an accord
with lenders that would revise its $85 million secured credit
agreement by restructuring it and extending the term.
   Under the proposed restructuring, the interest rate on its
borrowings will rise to half a percentage point above the
prime rate from the current one-quarter of a point over the
prime, and the method of determining how much may be borrowed
will be changed. The revised agreement also prohibits Calton,
a housing developer, from paying dividends, incurring
additional debt or acquiring additional land without the
lending group's consent, except under certain circumstances.

   The accord is conditioned on, among other things, Calton
entering into a definitive agreement to exchange certain
properties and joint-venture interests for about $18 million
face amount of its 16 5/8% senior subordinated notes by Jan.
10. Calton has said it has a nonbinding letter of intent to
acquire the notes and expects to have a definitive agreement
with the holder of the notes by Monday.
   The accord with lenders would extend the credit agreement
until Dec. 1, 1991, from April 30, 1991.
