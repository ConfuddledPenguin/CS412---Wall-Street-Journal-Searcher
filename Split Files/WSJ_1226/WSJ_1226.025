   AMERICAN CAPITAL &amp; RESEARCH CORP., Fairfax, Va., said it
completed a private placement of $25 million in senior
preferred stock with units of Ifint S.A., an international
investment firm affiliated with Italy's Agnelli group of
companies. American Capital, a provider of environmental and
engineering services, said it initially intends to use the
proceeds to reduce debt. It issued 250 shares of 9.75% senior
preferred sold with detachable warrants to purchase 2.2
million Class B shares at $12 a share. The transaction gives
Ifint an option to purchase an additional 250 shares of
senior preferred for $25 million in the next one to two
years.
