   LONDON (AP) -- The author Salman Rushdie promised he won't
authorize a paperback version of his novel, "The Satanic
Verses," a group of Islamic and Egyptian officials said. The
announcement was confirmed by a spokesman for Mr. Rushdie's
defense committee.
   In a statement released by Hesham el-Essawy, president of
the Islamic Society for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance,
Mr. Rushdie also said he doesn't agree with any statements
uttered by characters in the book that cast aspersions on
Islam, question the authenticity of the Koran, or reject the
divinity of Allah. And he agreed he won't authorize any
further translations of the book.

   "That is his statement and he signed it," said Frances
D'Souza, the defense committee chairman. Mr. Rushdie has been
in hiding under police guard since February 1989, when the
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said, before he
died, that the writer deserved death as a blasphemer.
   "This is the way we hope that will earn Rushdie's release
from his predicament," Mr. el-Essawy said of the statement.
"This is how we intend to make him a free man." He said that
he met Mr. Rushdie on Friday, and that they were joined by
Mohammed Ali Mahgoub, an Egyptian government official who
heads the Supreme Council of Scholars of Islamic Affairs;
Youssef Ahmed El Sharkawy, an Egyptian Embassy official; and
two clergy from the Regent's Park Mosque in London.
