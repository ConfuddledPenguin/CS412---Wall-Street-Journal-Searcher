   A cheerleader for the Little Cyclones, a swimmer and
gymnast, Noelle Smith was popular at Ames High School in
Ames, Iowa. And she seemed well-adjusted. But she thought she
was fat.
   To get ready for a Christmas dance during her junior year,
Noelle lost five pounds. After a mediocre report card a few
weeks later, the youngster, weighing 120 pounds and standing
5-foot-3, told her parents she was going on a diet.

   At first, she refused to eat anything but half a piece of
toast a day. Later, she began devouring over-the-counter diet
pills, as well as laxatives and diuretics. Eventually, she
was taking as many as 10 boxes of appetite suppressants a
week. Although Noelle tried to hide her habit, her parents
occasionally would find empty boxes of diet pills such as
Dexatrim and Acutrim in her pockets.
   In July 1989, Noelle died of heart failure. She was 20
years old.
   For the eight million Americans said to suffer from eating
disorders, the lure of readily available, over-the-counter
diet drugs often seems irresistible. The pills hold the
promise of quick, low-cost, painless weight loss, without the
need of a prescription. Doctors say that the majority of
patients they treat for anorexia or bulimia, mainly young
women, routinely misuse diet pills, diuretics, laxatives and
drugs such as ipecac that induce vomiting.
   The problem isn't confined to those with textbook eating
disorders. Many outwardly healthy teen-agers think of these
drugs as a standard way to diet. An astonishing 49% of
teen-age girls responding to a recent survey by Sassy
magazine reported using diet pills, while 13% of the
magazine's young readers have tried laxatives or diuretics
for weight loss.
   In the grip of compulsive dieting, many youngsters come to
depend on large doses of drugs, often with serious
consequences to their health. Taken in excess, common diet
pills can cause anxiety, high blood pressure and even
cerebral hemorrhages. Big doses of laxatives and diuretics
can deplete body levels of electrolytes such as potassium and
sodium. This can lead to cardiac failure.
   Young people have no trouble buying diet pills, which are
available throughout the country without any age
restrictions. If they choose, drugstores can exert some
control over their sale, such as keeping the products behind
the counter. But most don't. "There was nothing we could do
to shut off the supply," says Noelle's father, Anthony Smith.
"No one ever asked why a 16-year-old-girl was constantly
buying diet pills, laxatives and diuretics."
   A congressional inquiry earlier this year focused
attention on the problem. "The role {diet pills} play in
eating disorders has been documented," says Rep. Ron Wyden
(D., Ore.), whose subcommittee of the Small Business
Committee conducted the inquiry. "These products should be
kept out of the hands of kids."
   But after nearly a decade of reviewing the pills, the Food
and Drug Administration has done little but mull the problem.
Although it recently proposed banning 111 ingredients used
historically in nonprescription diet drugs (110 to be banned
as ineffective, and one, guar gum, as dangerous), most of
these aren't used anymore.
   The FDA has indicated it will continue to approve
phenylpropanolamine (PPA). This is the active ingredient in
the most common nonprescription diet pills, including
Dexatrim (made by Thompson Medical Co.) and Acutrim
(Ciba-Geigy Corp.), which together dominate the $220 million
market. PPA is also the ingredient critics say causes the
trouble. A mild stimulant chemically similar to adrenalin,
PPA is also found in such cold remedies as Contac and
Alka-Seltzer Plus -- products that aren't abused by dieters
and in which PPA isn't considered a problem.
   Marketers of the over-the-counter diet medications insist
their products are safe and effective. Industry-sponsored
studies recently submitted to the FDA prove it, says Bill
Soller, director of science and technology for the
Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
   The industry also points to a 1988 study by the National
Institute of Drug Abuse that says abuse of over-the-counter
diet pills has in fact declined over the past few years
because fewer kids use them. Twenty-two percent of
high-school seniors, boys and girls, currently use them,
according to the study.
   Critics of PPA-based diet pills contend such drugs
actually contribute to the development of eating disorders in
teenagers. At the same time, they say, there is no proof the
pills promote significant or permanent weight loss -- while
for some allergic or hypersensitive individuals and people
with certain health problems, the drugs are dangerous even
when taken according to directions.
   Labels warn of risk to diabetics and people with high
blood pressure and other conditions. But critics' indictment
of the drugs is much more sweeping: "They are neither
effective nor safe," asserts Thaddeus Prout, a physician who
chaired an FDA committee in the 1970s that reviewed
prescription diet drugs.
   Aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies has also
come under attack. Between them, Ciba-Geigy and Thompson
Medical spend $30 million a year advertising the products,
often holding out the promise of effortless weight loss.
Though the industry itself claims the drugs will help dieters
lose less than a pound a week, Dexatrim's packaging invites
buyers to "lose weight fast."
   Just about any drug can be dangerous when used improperly,
but some researchers say PPA is riskier than other commonly
available medications, in part simply because it is abused by
desperate people. In a recent report, Paul Raford, a
physician specializing in public health who advises Rep.
Wyden's subcommittee, concluded that PPA is far more
dangerous than ingredients in the sort of over-the-counter
drugs that people aren't tempted to take in huge quantities.
   Some marketers deny there is any abuse of the drugs. "I
don't have any data that show people under the age of 18 are
using our products," asserts Alison Mann, brand manager for
Thompson Medical's Dexatrim.
   Amphetamines, drugs once prescribed for dieters and
frequently abused, lost favor among doctors in the mid-1970s.
Now most doctors shun the potentially addictive drugs in
favor of behavior modification and nutrition training
programs.
   However, doctors estimate that 60% of patients with eating
disorders take laxatives, as purgatives. And many routinely
consume diuretics to achieve a temporary loss of fluids.
Anything for a quick weight loss. "They don't think about the
consequences; kids feel as if they are immortal," says Vivian
Meehan, president of the National Association of Anorexia
Nervosa and Associated Disorders, in Highland Park, Ill. "The
drugs help kids to eat chaotically."
   Consider Kelli Kirkpatrick, now 26. At 16, she would drink
mouthwash after meals to help make herself vomit, then take a
handful of laxative pills. "I'd be in a lot of pain after I
took them, but it didn't matter much to me," she says. "I
would feel my hip bone, and if the bone stuck out from my
stomach, I'd feel successful."
   Meredith Lee, a 16-year-old junior in suburban Chicago,
says diets and drugs often go together in her school. She
began dieting with a friend when she was in the eighth grade,
at first eating only carrots and rice cakes for lunch. Soon,
the two stopped eating altogether. Then Ms. Lee began using
nonprescription diuretics "to flush the extra water out of
me." She began taking two pills in the morning and two at
night. But once, after downing more than 20 pills, she awoke
to feel her room spinning. She was violently ill for days and
had to take medication to stop vomiting.
   Despite the quantities of drugs some young women consume,
many are initially successful at concealing their behavior.
Ms. Lee convinced her mother that her diuretics overdose was
a bout of flu. Doctors note that people with eating disorders
are often ashamed and very secretive.
   Even though Noelle Smith's parents were aware of her
illness and had her hospitalized several times, they couldn't
stop her drug use. Every time they confiscated a box of diet
pills or laxatives, she would buy more. She told friends she
would resort to shoplifting when she couldn't borrow the
money for them.
   Access was never a problem for Jessica McDonald, now a
20-year-old college junior in Washington, D.C. She started
buying diet pills at 12, taking a cue from a friend at ballet
school. Two years later, she added diuretics and laxatives as
drugs of abuse. Though she shopped at the same drugstore
nearly every day, "No one ever said anything to me," she
says.
   Because these drugs are available without a prescription,
they are widely thought to be innocuous. Their very
availability bestows an aura of safety.
   Neither Ex-Lax nor Correctol brands of chemical laxatives,
which doctors say are popular with obsessive dieters because
they quickly produce temporary weight loss, have label
warnings about misuse by dieters, though they do caution
against prolonged use. "We are aware the abuse of these
products exists, but we haven't done anything to encourage
it," says a spokesman for Schering-Plough Corp., maker of
Correctol. A Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. spokesman says he
is unaware of any abuse of the company's Ex-Lax.
   The label on a box of Acutrim warns only that the pills
aren't for children under 12. It doesn't warn against taking
too much. Boxes of Dexatrim urge somewhat more caution. They
warn users not to exceed the recommended dosage and they tell
youngsters between 12 and 18 to consult a doctor before
taking the pills.
   A spokesman for Ciba-Geigy says that he doesn't believe
Acutrim is heavily abused, but that the company plans to
alter labeling in the next few months anyway. Boxes will say
Acutrim isn't intended for those under 18. "There's been a
lot of publicity about this issue," he says, "and we feel a
responsibility to do something."
   Rep. Wyden advocates making directions on diet pills more
specific or including warnings about misuse. The National
Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders has
proposed some limitations on selling diet pills, laxatives
and diuretics to customers under 18, like keeping the
products behind the counter where they have to be asked for.
   But retailers and manufacturers point out that the drugs
have been approved by the FDA, and say the agency is
virtually certain to bless the continued use of PPA in
nonprescription diet drugs even if it recommends new
labeling. "Limiting the access of minors would be very
difficult," says Mr. Soller of the manufacturers'
association. "Teen-agers found a way to buy alcohol.
Restricting access simply camouflages the problem."
   For now, that problem remains right there in the open on
drugstore shelves. Mr. Smith, Noelle's father, spreads on his
dining-room table snapshots he took of a display of diet
pills and diuretics at a local drugstore. "We weren't perfect
parents," he says. "We made mistakes, but they were loving
mistakes. We just didn't know over-the-counter drugs could
cause such a problem."
