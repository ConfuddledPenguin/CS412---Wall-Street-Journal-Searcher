   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. said 25,000 families and friends of people serving in the
Persian Gulf were mistakenly billed for telephone calls that
were supposed to be free, and the charges will be canceled.
   AT&amp;T's offer to let men and women serving in the Gulf make
free calls during Thanksgiving week resulted in 140,000
calls. But some local phone companies did not follow through
on instructions not to bill the troops' families for the
calls, AT&amp;T spokesman Richard Wallerstein said. The calls
were placed to families all over the U.S.

   Mr. Wallerstein said no one will have to pay for the
bills, no matter how high they were. The offer was for one
three-minute call for each soldier, but Mr. Wallerstein said
AT&amp;T had no way to enforce the limit. He said he had heard
some of the bills had reached $500, but had no specific
information.
   AT&amp;T first offered free calls home for a week in
mid-October, then renewed the offer for Thanksgiving. A total
of about 275,000 calls were made during the two weeks. Each
offered week of free calls cost AT&amp;T more than $1 million,
Mr. Wallerstein said.
   Meanwhile, AT&amp;T announced a free call-home campaign for
U.S. Navy sailors and Marines stationed on ships in the
Middle East. The offer is good through New Year's Eve, and
Mr. Wallerstein said he didn't expect any problems. "We'll
just do the bills right this time," he said.
