   Grinches raided the financial markets Christmas Eve.
   While many traders and investors found ample reason Monday
not to be in their offices, the diehards who showed up were
decidedly pessimistic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
12.37 points to close at 2621.29 in a short pre-holiday
trading session. Bond traders bid the prices of long-term
Treasury bonds down. The only bright spot was in the foreign
exchange market, where the dollar posted gains against both
the mark and the yen.

   Traders said weekend saber rattling spooked investors
Monday. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said Saturday
that "the clock is ticking" quickly toward a war in the
Middle East. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, said
Tel Aviv will be Iraq's first target if war breaks out. And
in Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the danger of
war "is very close." Adding to concerns was Iraq's recall of
its ambassadors to the U.S. and United Nations for talks in
Iraq.
   In the bond market, the war worries combined with year-end
profit-taking to drive prices of long-term Treasury bonds
down sharply. The more popular short-term debt securities
were off only modestly, even though the bond market is
bracing for the sale later this week of a record $12.5
billion of two-year Treasury notes and a record $8.5 billion
of four-year notes. Thin trading volume exacerbated the
downward trend, analysts said.
   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was thin, too.
Volume on the Big Board totaled a mere 57.2 million shares,
eclipsing the previous slowest day of the year when 63.4
million shares traded on the day after Thanksgiving. The
stock exchange closed at 2 p.m. Monday, two hours earlier
than usual.
   Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst with his own research
firm, said that despite the down day on Christmas Eve, the
stock market hasn't performed badly in recent weeks.
"Everyone is sitting around pooh-poohing this as a bear
market rally, but it is a 10% rally" from the October lows.
What's more, he said, so far this year the market is down a
mere 1% on a total return basis, which takes into account
dividends as well as price changes. "It hasn't been all that
bad a year," he said.
   "Overall, we're seeing some positive things," he said.
"The people on Wall Street are very negative, but if you look
at how well many investors did in 1990, all the negative news
gets confusing."
   Even all the concern about the Middle East doesn't seem to
have a very damping effect on stocks, he said. "The Middle
East is obviously a question mark, but if you look at the
prices of crude oil and gold as a proxy for investor concern
about the Middle East, you would have to think the market is
relatively unconcerned." Gold prices are almost unchanged
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August and, while the
price of oil shot up as high as $40 a barrel, it has since
fallen to about $27, up from a 12-month low of about $15.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Declining issues on the Big Board
outpaced gainers, 842 to 527.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were down sharply. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond lost seven-eighths of a point, or about $8.75
for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue rose
to 8.36%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained. In New York trading the currency was
quoted at 1.5440 marks and 136.00 yen, compared with 1.5289
marks and 135.55 yen Friday.
