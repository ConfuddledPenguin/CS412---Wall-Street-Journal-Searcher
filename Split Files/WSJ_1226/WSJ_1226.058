   A U.S. bankruptcy court judge barred the New York Stock
Exchange from seeking a record fine of $50 million from
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. for securities-law
violations.
   The Big Board wants to punish Drexel and its brokerage
unit for the six trading-related felonies that the company
pleaded guilty to in September 1989. The stock exchange and
Drexel were in the middle of settlement talks earlier this
year when the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection.

   Under bankruptcy law, the exchange can't take action
against Drexel without the bankruptcy court's permission.
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Francis Conrad, however, sided
with Drexel, ruling that the exchange's efforts would result
in "the misallocation of scarce resources" that should go to
other creditors.
   A spokesman for the exchange said: "The New York Stock
Exchange is reviewing the decision to determine whether an
appeal is appropriate." The exchange was seeking a fine of as
much as $25 million each for Drexel and its brokerage unit,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which joined the parent company
in bankruptcy-court proceedings.
   The Big Board claimed that it needed to fine Drexel to
send a message to other firms that wrongdoing won't be
tolerated. But Judge Conrad, who is presiding over Drexel's
bankruptcy proceedings in Manhattan, said: "The public policy
reasons for the New York Stock Exchange's desire to go
forward in its forum don't appear to accomplish much more
than that which has already been accomplished by the U.S.
attorney and the Securities and Exchange Commission."
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan prosecuted the
case that resulted in Drexel's guilty pleas and a settlement
with the SEC. As part of the settlement, Drexel agreed to pay
$650 million in fines and penalties. The six fraud charges
involved securities transactions from 1984 to 1986.
   Judge Conrad also said that allowing the Big Board to
proceed would divert Drexel from its main task -- coming up
with a bankruptcy reorganization plan. Drexel's "professional
attention must remain focused on this critical stage," the
judge said.
   The stock exchange is continuing to investigate whether to
take disciplinary action against individual Drexel employees
in connection with the company's guilty plea. Those
investigations won't be affected by the judge's ruling.

   FLORIDA'S SUPREME COURT endorses restrictions on attorney
advertising.
   The state's highest court last week agreed to
recommendations by the state bar association that will
tightly control how lawyers can advertise on TV.
   The rules, which take effect Jan. 1, will prohibit lawyers
from dramatizing their profession or their services. No music
will be permitted in commercials. Nor will slogans or
testimonials from clients (real or simulated). And no more
than one voice speaking will be allowed.
   Supporters of the measures say they want to ensure that
the public gets accurate information about attorneys'
services and that the legal profession maintains a
respectable image.
   But opponents say the restrictions are nothing less than
an attack on First Amendment rights to free speech. David W.
Singer, a personal-injury attorney who spends about $500,000
a year on ads, says the restrictions unfairly dictate how an
attorney should best reach potential clients and will result
in little more than "cookiecutter" commercials.
   Several U.S. Supreme Court rulings have supported
attorneys' rights to advertise but have left room for states
to impose restrictions.
   Some attorneys have characterized Florida's rules as the
toughest in the nation. Mr. Singer says a group he helped
found, Citizens Against Censorship, plans to fight the
measures, either by filing an appeal in federal district
court and climbing the federal appellate ladder, or by
appealing directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   "It's not going to end here," Mr. Singer said. "I'm very
confident we're going to have the last laugh."

   INSURER ISN'T LIABLE for naturally occurring pollution,
appeals court rules.
   A Colorado appeals court in Denver ruled that West
American Insurance Co. of Anaheim, Calif., doesn't have to
pay for cleaning up contamination in Red Mountain Creek, in
southwestern Colorado.
   It is believed to be the first time that a court has ruled
that a property owner is not entitled to insurance coverage
for pollution damage arising from natural causes rather than
intentional activity by the policyholder.
   West American sued Frank W. Baumgartner, who owns mining
properties in the area, alleging the insurer was not
responsible for Mr. Baumgartner's legal defense or potential
damages in an environmental suit.
   Mr. Baumgartner has been sued by three mining companies
that allegedly released hazardous substances into the creek.
In the pending suit, the companies allege that acid water
from Mr. Baumgartner's land seeped into the creek and
contributed to the contamination.
   In an opinion late last week, the appeals panel ruled that
Mr. Baumgartner's insurance policies do not cover pollution
that occurs over a long period of time, regardless of how it
was caused.
   In a dissent, Judge Sandra I. Rothenberg said that it was
unfair to deny coverage to Mr. Baumgartner for the pollution.
She said Mr. Baumgartner had not intentionally polluted the
creek and that the acid water from his property occurred as
the result of a natural leaching process.
   Mr. Baumgartner said he would not appeal.
   Lawyers for the insurer could not be reached for comment.
   Barry Ostrager, a lawyer with the New York law firm
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett who represents insurance companies
in such disputes, said the case is unusual but that the
ruling is consistent with principles applied by other courts.
   "Coverage is not available for gradual pollution. This
situation is no exception," he said.

   FILING AN AMENDED tax return isn't evidence of fraud,
appeals court rules.
   The decision by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in Manhattan overturns the conviction of James Dyer, former
mayor of Danbury, Conn. Mr. Dyer was found guilty last year
of filing a false tax return for 1986 after the trial judge
told the jury that Mr. Dyer's amended return was an admission
of guilt. The jury acquitted Mr. Dyers of six other charges.
   In the amended 1986 return, Mr. Dyer included the $10,357
in income that prosecutors charge he was trying to avoid
taxes on. Prosecutors claimed that the circumstances
surrounding the filing of the amended return indicated that
Mr. Dyer knew all along that the original return was
incorrect.
   But the appeals-court panel said: "An amended return
cannot provide an inference of fraud; it can only support an
inference of mistake." The court ordered a new trial for Mr.
Dyer.
