   ROME -- Italian Transport Minister Carlo Bernini has been
thrown a hot potato. He must decide whether to unleash
airline competition in Italy now or wait until 1993, when new
European Community rules will mandate freer airline
competition throughout the 12-member EC.
   The issue landed in Mr. Bernini's office in September,
with the expiration of Alitalia Airlines' government-granted
concessions to fly on domestic and international routes. A
handful of carriers seized on the expiration to ask for
scheduled route concessions in Italy and internationally. Mr.
Bernini must now decide, in renewing the 81% state-owned flag
carrier's mandate, whether to allow other Italian airlines to
compete with Alitalia.

   Like so many business issues in Italy, this one involves
politics as well as the bottom line. Mr. Bernini's decision
will affect troubled Alitalia's financial health and its work
force, the survival and growth of secondary Italian airlines
and, not least, the opportunities for travelers to get a
better deal.
   "In the U.S., one person out of three flies once a year,"
says Mauro Dutto, a transport-committee member of Italy's
Chamber of Deputies. "In Italy, it's one person out of 50.
Our railway is in crisis. Our highways are overcrowded. We
have to develop these air relations."
   Not everyone agrees. "The private airlines are really
pushing for deregulation," says Nicolao Denobili, an airline
analyst for Cimo, a Milan brokerage firm. "But for the
Italian government, there is a lot of pressure to keep things
the way they are."
   In Italy, there is visceral opposition to cuts in funding
that could jeopardize public employment and expose protected
state enterprises to competition. At a time when
privatization is the watchword world-wide, Italy is still
nationalizing industries. And the country often is a laggard
in implementing EC rules. "Italians -- the government and
politicians -- are the best Europeans in Europe," says
Maurizio Codurri, a Milan-based lawyer who does some aviation
work. "But we hardly apply all the European regulations. We
say one thing and do another."
   Against this backdrop, Mr. Bernini must decide whether to
go the route of a few other EC states and allow second
airlines to fly to major EC cities in competition with the
flag carrier, something that will be possible in any case
after 1992. He might also stick with the status quo, give
Alitalia two more years of protection and frustrate the
aspirations of a clutch of newcomers. Or he could find a
compromise.
   Mr. Bernini and his staff declined to be interviewed. But
Federico Quaranta, director-general of the Italian Civil
Aviation Authority, says he expects that a plan will emerge
in two or three months. "The minister is sensitive to the new
situation in the European market," notes Mr. Quaranta, who
also suggests that Alitalia will probably lose some of its
grip on domestic routes and that and a few other airlines
will be licensed on internal and international routes. "This
is the moment when change has to come."
   Even now, money-losing Alitalia doesn't have the entire
Italian domestic market to itself. Some 10% of the business
is held by Alisarda, a Sardinian carrier controlled by the
Aga Khan. But profitable Alisarda operates with the tacit
approval of Alitalia and held government-granted route
concessions before they expired along with Alitalia's in
September.
   The two airlines jointly own a commuter carrier called
Avianova. Alisarda's launch of a Rome-Milan shuttle service
in March -- an event billed as a competition breakthrough --
essentially is a subcontract from Alitalia and the two must
charge identical prices. Even Alisarda's hope of setting up a
base in Florence and flying to European cities isn't seen as
a threat to Alitalia, because Florence has a short runway and
the national airline's planes are too large to land there.
   Apart from Alisarda, the few remaining Italian regional
airlines -- TAS Airways, Transavio, Air Dolomites and
Aliadriatica -- are insignificant. And the list of those that
went out of business is long.
   On many routes, Alitalia does have the market to itself.
For a traveler wishing to fly from Pisa to Palermo, there is
only one choice: Alitalia's commuter subsidiary ATI. From
Genoa to Rome, again the only possibility is Alitalia. "I fly
almost every week," says Kevin Tempestini, who follows the
airline industry for the Milan merchant bank Euromobiliare.
"And I never even saw any Alisarda planes."
   For Italians who fly abroad, the situation isn't much
different. Aside from some charter airline offerings, the odd
commuter connection from a provincial center to a nearby
country and Alisarda's summer routes to Europe from Sardinia,
Alitalia has an exclusive franchise on international routes
out of Italy. Thus, the choice is Alitalia or the airline
from the destination country.
   "We are still in a monopoly situation," says Mr. Codurri,
the Milan lawyer.
