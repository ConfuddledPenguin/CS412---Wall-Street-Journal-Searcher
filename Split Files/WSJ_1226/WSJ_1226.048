   NEW YORK -- Mobil Oil Corp. and Vietnamese and Soviet
officials are quietly exploring a possible three-way
oil-production venture off Vietnam that could lead to the
first U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the energy sector in a third
country.
   If the 15-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam is
lifted, Mobil hopes to join with a Soviet-Vietnamese venture,
Vietsopetro, in drilling for oil in an offshore block off
southern Vietnam where the U.S. company struck oil before the
communist victory in 1975. According to diplomatic and
oil-industry sources, the idea for the three-way project was
broached by Mobil after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, when oil
prices shot up and U.S.-Soviet cooperation reached new
heights.

   John Lord, a Mobil spokesman, said the company is "very
interested" in cooperation with the Soviet Union and has been
talking with Vietnam. "We want to go back to Vietnam, and
naturally we want to go back where oil is," he said.
   Sources said Mobil representatives met with Vietnamese
officials in New York in September to propose technical
collaboration with Vietsopetro. Addressing a U.S. business
group in New York several weeks later, Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach disclosed the existence of a
proposal for a three-way venture, though he didn't mention
Mobil. According to participants at the meeting, he said he
had discussed the idea in New York with his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze. Mr. Shevardnadze, who
announced his resignation last week, was said to have told
Mr. Thach that he favored the idea, but that details would
have to be worked out with oil officials in Moscow.
   According to one source, both Texaco Inc. and Mobil
proposed a venture with the Soviets and Vietnamese. A Texaco
official, however, said he was unaware of any proposal for a
three-way arrangement. A Texaco spokesman said several
company officials visited Vietnam in September and discussed
the possibility of cooperation "if and when" the trade
embargo is lifted. He also said Texaco has been working with
the Soviet Union on a feasibility study for oil exploration
in the Russian republic.
   Another oil-industry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Mobil proposed three-way cooperation in
Vietnam for both immediate and long-term considerations.
Having earlier prospected in the field where Vietsopetro is
now producing, Mobil possesses technical data, as well as
technology, that could substantially increase the field's
output. And by working closely with the Soviets in Vietnam,
the company hopes to stand in good stead for more-profitable
cooperation in oil fields in the Soviet Union itself.
   Several weeks ago, a senior Vietnamese diplomat at the
U.N. confirmed that oil officials in Moscow are receptive to
the idea of three-way cooperation. "The Soviets have said
that such collaboration with American companies can be
considered in the blocks held by Vietsopetro, but not in the
field currently being exploited" by the joint venture, the
diplomat said.
   U.S. business groups, including oil companies, have
recently intensified their lobbying in Washington for an end
to the trade embargo against Vietnam. The Bush administration
says normalization of relations with Vietnam can come only
after the settlement of the Cambodian issue, which it says
was created by the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978.
   But the administration recently raised the possibility
that the embargo may be lifted before establishment of full
diplomatic relations if Vietnam shows a cooperative attitude.
Speaking to a group of U.S. business executives, Richard
Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the
Pacific, said that because of the signing of the Paris accord
on Cambodia last January, "the U.S. is prepared to take
certain confidence-building steps as a measure of our
willingness to work with Vietnam to turn the page on the
sorry page of history that we hope to leave behind us." Asked
in a telephone interview if the envisaged steps include
lifting the embargo, Mr. Solomon said, "IMF and World Bank
loans (and) the lifting of the embargo are important for the
Vietnamese, and we have to see some important developments on
Cambodia in order to move on those."
   Administration sources confirmed that Mobil has been
seeking administration support for a three-way venture, but
they added that Washington has no plan to lift the embargo.
