   The end of an old year may be an appropriate moment to
recall an old economist: Arthur F. Burns, who served as
Federal Reserve Board chairman for nearly a decade in the
1960s and 1970s.
   While best remembered for his Fed role, Mr. Burns carried
out many other duties in his long life. These spanned
teaching economics to a young Milton Friedman; serving as
President Eisenhower's chief economist; ambassadorial duty in
Bonn; and heading the National Bureau of Economic Research,
official arbiter of when recessions start and end.

   It's the last of these activities that comes to mind now,
when policy makers in Washington are struggling to limit a
new recession that clearly began in recent weeks but still
awaits the National Bureau's official stamp.
   Mr. Burns's long tenure there ran, with public-service
interruptions, from 1930 to 1967. While there, he stressed
developing data that would help public and private planners
better assess the economy's health and prospects. The
economist, who died at age 83 in 1987, often recalled with
dismay the paucity of such data when the Great Depression set
in.
   "We were flying blind in those years," he said. He would
have welcomed a federal effort to maintain a broad
job-vacancy series, and he was distressed that some
barometers, such as the rate at which workers were quitting
their jobs, were being scrapped in cost-reduction drives he
labeled "penny wise and pound foolish."
   An unfolding paradox brings Mr. Burns's concern about
economic data to mind now. The statistical barometers on
which policy makers rely for early signs of trouble in
general have performed poorly, giving little warning that a
recession was imminent. As a result, efforts in Washington to
limit the downturn, such as moving to easier money at the
Fed, have been woefully slow in materializing. This
tardiness, in turn, could allow a deeper, longer slump than
might otherwise occur.
   To be sure, no economic barometer could have signaled the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the consequent surge in oil
prices. But Geoffrey Moore, the director of Columbia
University's Center for International Business Cycle Research
and a top authority on such matters, reckons in retrospect
that the new recession began as long ago as June, well before
the Iraqi move. Yet, economic planners in the Bush
administration, as well as Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, were
still forecasting recession-free growth as late as November.
   By no coincidence, the Fed showed little inclination to
ease monetary policy. Compounding matters is the rising sea
of fiscal red ink that gives pause to the sorts of federal
tax-cutting and boosts in spending that typically play a
recession-fighting role. Of late, in fact, the trend has been
toward higher taxes, particularly at state and local levels,
and curbs on outlays.
   The inadequacy of the nation's economic "radar" can be
seen, among other places, in the behavior of the Commerce
Department's index of leading indicators in recent months.
Since World War II, the index has entered sustained declines
some 10 months, on average, before recessions have set in.
But this time the index was continuing to rise as recently as
June.
   A closer look at the index shows its serious shortcomings,
which partly stem from what Mr. Burns would call penny wise
and pound foolish cutbacks at the statistics mills. (Since
1985, federal outlays for economic and statistical analysis
have fallen about $4 million, or about 10%.)
   One of the index's 11 components -- initial claims for
unemployment insurance -- often tends to move up or down
coincidentally with general business activity, rather than in
advance. The indicator was rising as the 1981-82 recession
struck and falling as the 1973-75 recession ended. It serves
as a leading indicator only because, to pare spending on
data-collection, the government some years ago discontinued
several labor-oriented series -- including the labor layoff
rate, which faithfully led the economy's ups and downs. A
substitute series that was also linked to labor was needed
and the unemployment-insurance measure was deemed closest to
filling the bill.
   While some 75% of the labor force now holds service-type
jobs, the only other index component that bears directly on
labor is the average workweek for production workers in
manufacturing industries. Of the remaining nine components,
five monitor manufacturing, ranging from the level of
unfilled orders in durable-goods industries to the new-order
rate for manufacturers of consumer goods. A measure of
building permits for new homes is the sole component gauging
housing activity, a hugely important economic sector.
   The remaining components are all of questionable value as
leading indicators.
   The stock market, as mirrored in the monthly averages of
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, was severely tarnished
as a barometer after its colossal false alarm in 1987. A
measure of "consumer expectations," based on surveys by the
University of Michigan, has a checkered record as a leading
indicator. It has fallen steadily before some recessions,
such as the moderate downturn of 1969-70, but risen just
before others, such as the severe 1981-82 recession.
   The remaining component is a money-supply indicator -- the
broad M2 money gauge, adjusted for inflation. It also shows
an erratic performance, falling sharply before the mild,
short recession of 1980 but no worse than flat as the 1981-82
recession approached. The indicator "is poorly designed" to
reflect a tightening of credit, since it focuses more on "how
the public wants to hold money," says PaineWebber's Maury
Harris. There are no interest-rate gauges in the index.
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly newsletter based
in Sedona, Ariz., recently asked some 50 prominent
forecasters whether they felt that the government's "economic
statistical gathering system has deteriorated significantly
over the past decade." Seventy-six percent believed this to
be the case, 17% were "not certain" and only 7% disagreed.
   The survey also sought suggestions on how the government
might improve its data. Sixty-five percent of the Blue Chip
economists urged "increased funding" to improve "the quality
and timeliness of the data." Other popular suggestions
included more coordination between the various federal
agencies that collect and supply data, a greater effort to
gather information about the economy's growing service
sector, more comprehensive data on international
transactions, greater personal contact between Washington's
data-gatherers and those who supply information, and more
attention to the so-called underground economy, comprising
legal and illegal off-the-books transactions.
   All are suggestions Arthur Burns would have endorsed. His
presence is sorely missed now, as Washington belatedly
scrambles to contain a new recession.
