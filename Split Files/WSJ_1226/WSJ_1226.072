   IRVINE, Calif. -- Conventional wisdom suggests that the
computer industry eventually will come to be dominated by a
small number of companies, as is the case in the auto
industry.
   The case of AST Research Inc. suggests otherwise.

   While high-tech mergers are back in the news with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s attempt to take over NCR Corp.,
and with a raft of aging computer concerns retrenching, some
younger computer manufacturers are growing rapidly, reaping
the rewards of building relatively inexpensive computers
around standard designs and powerful microprocessors.
   The performance of AST, an up-and-down company that lately
has hit its stride, illustrates why the ranks of computer
makers will probably remain thick for some years. The company
is a textbook case of how to build market share quickly by
developing a variety of computers that blend the latest
me-too features with appealing variations, then pricing them
aggressively.
   AST's growth, meanwhile, suggests that International
Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Compaq
Computer Corp. may not have the elite segment of the personal
computer industry to themselves forever.
   "AST has pulled away from the pack of second-tier"
personal computer companies and, in some corporate accounts,
is challenging the top trio, said Andrew Neff, an analyst at
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Indeed, AST said last week that earnings for its fiscal
second quarter ending Dec. 28 will nearly double, exceeding
expectations and driving the stock up 21% to close at $32 a
share, a 52-week high. AST stock closed Monday at $33.50,
down 25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
   It isn't likely AST can find a home in the top ranks of
the PC industry any time soon. Its future depends on the
reception given various new computers. And the company has
stumbled in the past, posting a loss less than two years ago.
Yet AST seems to have shed its image as a "clone maker," a
pejorative reference to those bare-bones PC suppliers who
merely knock off the most popular features of brandname
makers and sell them cheap.
   AST has won the business of many large purchasers of PCs
through a string of skillful moves such as the following:
   -- It introduced in July 1989 a line of PCs with
replaceable microprocessors, allowing customers to benefit
from improvements in processing speeds without discarding
their entire machine. The feature is such a hit that even
rivals such as IBM are adopting it.
   -- It began selling in Japan this fall a machine
compatible with NEC Corp.'s personal computer, which
dominates Japan's market but is incompatible with the IBM PC.
Some observers consider AST's effort the most ambitious by
any U.S. concern competing in Japan's tough PC market.
   -- It introduced in October a PC powered by Intel Corp.'s
top 486 chip for $4,000, less than half the price of
comparable machines from IBM and Compaq.
   -- It unveiled last month its first notebook computer,
with features similar to Compaq's model but at a price tag
half the size. Neither Apple nor IBM offer notebook models at
all.
   By such steps, "AST has demonstrated they are not a clone
company; they are an engineering firm with the resources to
produce quality products," said William O'Kelly, an
information manager for Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures unit,
which has bought hundreds of AST models in the past 18
months.
   AST opened it doors 10 years ago, the brainchild of three
immigrant engineers who saw a chance to make a fortune
selling add-ons to IBM's original PC. The company began
making devices that connected the PC to mainframe and
minicomputers, then in 1983 hit it big with a product called
SixPakPlus, which expanded the number of peripherals that
could plug into the PC and increased its memory, allowing
users to run larger programs on their machines. Over the next
three years, AST's revenues went from $12.7 million to $138.6
million.
   But just before the add-on business began to deteriorate
because IBM and others started shipping PCs with greater
amounts of memory and more slots for peripherals, AST opted
to build its own PCs.
   "We realized the writing was on the wall (for add-on
companies) and that we were vulnerable," said Albert Wong, a
cofounder who left the company two years ago. "We knew we had
to go into (PCs) or face the consequences of slowing growth."
   The company got off to a strong start, offering PCs with
Intel's lastest microprocessor and "matching Compaq (the
pacesetter among IBM-compatibles) machine for machine," said
Stewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter.
   But AST stumbled in late 1988 because of an initial
failure to match a new Compaq feature and because of costs
tied to its departure from much of its board business. For
its fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, it posted its first loss
and laid off 6% of its work force.
   The reversal caused soul-searching among AST's three
founders. Mr. Wong departed, leaving the company in the hands
of its other two founders, Safi Qureshey and Thomas Yuen.
Rather than continue trying to match Compaq stride for
stride, Mr. Qureshey and Mr. Yuen decided to launch a new
product line that would allow customers to simply plug in the
latest, fastest microprocessor while retaining the rest of
their machine.
   The move was a hit with customers and the new line helped
AST hold down costs, another key to its current strength.
Executives now boast that the company can undercut prices
significantly on IBM and Compaq machines because its costs
are low.
   Indeed, AST's spending could be too low in some areas. In
its latest complete fiscal year, ended June 30, AST spent a
mere $18.4 million on research and development, or 3.4% of
revenue. But while many other computer makers spend twice, or
even three times as much, AST appears to be getting plenty
for its money.
   AST has hit some snags along the way. In April, the
company won kudos for planning an assault on the heart of
Japan's PC market. It had designed a machine compatible with
those sold by market-leader NEC and planned to sell it under
the brand name of a major Japanese electronics concern such
as Sharp. Eight months later, AST still intends to compete in
Japan with its products, but powerful Japanese companies have
shunned it and now AST must peddle its wares using its own,
largely unknown label.
   According to Mr. Yuen, AST's greatest strength lies in its
ties to a cadre of sophisticated computer resellers in the
U.S. While most other second-tier PC makers have left their
fortunes in the hands of traditional storefront retailers,
AST gets a hefty slice of its sales from so-called
value-added resellers, which often are chosen to outfit
corporations with PCs.
   That tie-in puts AST in position to exploit the weaknesses
of such ailing minicomputer makers as Wang Laboratories Inc.
and Data General Corp. Networks of PCs are increasingly
replacing older minicomputers that support a number of dumb
terminals. As that shift occurs, resellers who have
specialized in minicomputers are scrambling to adopt PC
makers.
   Still, AST almost lost the loyalty of its value-added
resellers a few years back. "In 1987-88, we made some major
blunders" by slighting smaller dealers in a misguided bid to
win points with major retail chains, Mr. Yuen said.
   "A lot of (retailers) told us they could make us," added
Mr. Qureshey. "You don't build a company that way."
