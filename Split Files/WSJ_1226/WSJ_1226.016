   DENVER -- Hallador Petroleum Co. said a special meeting of
shareholders that had been scheduled for last Friday to vote
on a 1-for-10 reverse stock split was delayed, owing to a
one-day delay in mailing notice of the meeting. The effective
date for the split is expected to be next Monday, the day for
which the meeting was rescheduled.
