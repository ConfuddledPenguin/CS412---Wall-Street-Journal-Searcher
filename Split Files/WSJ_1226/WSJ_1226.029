   WASHINGTON -- The top U.S. military commander in the
Persian Gulf has advised President Bush that his ground
forces won't be fully prepared for an all-out assault against
Iraq until February, according to Pentagon officials.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney conveyed that message to the
White House from Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and other
high-ranking American commanders, these officials said,
during a pre-Christmas briefing on the military situation in
the Middle East.

   The recommendation to delay any major offensive moves, for
at least two or three weeks after the Jan. 15 United Nations
Security Council deadline requiring Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait, is certain to complicate Mr. Bush's deliberations
about whether and when to resort to force.
   Both Mr. Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, are believed to support the overall
thrust of the Gulf commander's recommendations. Some Pentagon
planners, however, have emphasized that a first round of air
strikes could begin before all of the approximately 250,000
U.S. ground forces are deployed and fully prepared for desert
warfare.
   Administration spokesmen have declined to provide details
about Monday's briefing, and White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said only that "we're assured that the forces will
respond as necessary, and the buildup continues."
   From Gen. Schwarzkopf's perspective, the extra time is
important to build up supplies of munitions and high-tech
missiles, improve coordination among U.S. units as well as
between American and allied forces and ensure proper training
for the most recent arrivals. Weather and transportation
problems have slowed the arrival of heavy tanks from Western
Europe, while many pilots in the Gulf still are waiting for
special navigational equipment and other hardware intended to
give the U.S. an edge in battles at night.
   Mr. Cheney and his aides have quietly warned lawmakers and
others that some U.S. troops won't be ready to fight on Jan.
15. But the issue erupted in controversy last week when Lt.
Gen. Calvin Waller, in his first major interview since
becoming the deputy commander of Operation Desert Shield,
surprised the White House by bluntly telling reporters that
U.S. forces "will not be ready for combat activities" by the
Jan. 15 deadline. The lieutenant general added that he "can't
imagine" President Bush ordering an offensive that quickly.
   Without congressional action, Pentagon officials are
concerned that many reserve units now in the Gulf will have
to start returning to the U.S. by February or March.
   Secretary Cheney and the White House initially tried to
play down Lt. Gen. Waller's comments, emphasizing that they
threatened to undercut the strategy of keeping maximum
political and military pressure on Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   But Pentagon officials noted that during their recent tour
of Saudi Arabia, Secretary Cheney and Gen. Powell received
messages of caution from other commanders in the field. And
so far, Mr. Cheney has gone out of his way to show that he
isn't prone to second-guess the day-to-day decisions of the
career soldiers running the operation.
