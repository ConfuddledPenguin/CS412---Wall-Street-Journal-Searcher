   NEW RULE BOOSTS INTEREST on disputed corporate
underpayments.
   The interest rate applied to large corporate taxes being
contested increases in 1991 to 13% from 8%, under new IRS
regulations. The higher rate applies only to underpayments
that exceed $100,000, and only for calculating interest
accumulating after 1990, even if the disputed tax is for an
earlier year. It also kicks in only after the IRS issues
either a 30-day or a 90-day assessment notice. Firms must
decide either to pay the amount up front before litigating or
risk larger interest costs while in Tax Court.

   Lawyers say the rule makes it less attractive for
companies to contest in Tax Court; instead, many may pay and
then litigate in federal court or Claims Court for any
recovery. "It's very unfair," says Jere McGaffey, head of the
American Bar Association's tax unit. "For some firms with
disputes going back six or seven years, the interest is going
to be more than the tax." Albert Ellentuck, a Washington tax
lawyer, says, "You might not want to proceed with a marginal
case."
   Congress expects the IRS to raise $2 billion over five
years by nudging firms to speed up payments.
                                                                                                       

   MOVING TO THE MARIANAS isn't a way out of paying federal
tax.
   Debra and David Preece, Spring, Texas, were informed that
a company in which they were shareholders might be sold.
Hoping to benefit from a territorial income tax that's 95%
lower than federal tax, the Preeces moved to Saipan in 1985.
They took up residency by opening up a bank account and
registering to vote, among other things. A month later, the
company was sold, netting the couple about $5.2 million. The
Preeces filed a return in Saipan, noting their stock gain was
subject to territorial tax. Soon after, they returned to the
U.S.
   The IRS said the Preeces improperly failed to file federal
returns. They turned to Tax Court, arguing that as residents
of the Marianas they were relieved of the obligation to file
U.S. returns. Chief Judge Nims concluded otherwise, saying
their bid to establish residency was contrary to an
anti-abuse provision of tax law that prevents individuals
from avoiding federal tax merely by moving to U.S.
territories.
                                                                                                       

   CALIFORNIANS get infant-care credit if they forgo income
and stay home.
   A new California law supplements existing child-care tax
credits to businesses and employees. Now, families can elect
to have one parent give up income to remain home and care for
an infant, and get a tax break based on estimated lost
income. A maximum of $1,000 credit per family is allowed. The
child can't be more than 13 months old, and the credits are
reduced if the married couple earns more than $40,000 a year,
or a single head of household earns more than $28,500.
   Take a Sacramento family earning $39,000. While the
husband works full time, the wife stays home to care for the
baby from July to December, after having worked the first six
months. The couple may claim a credit of $500, or half of the
maximum allowed, against their tax bill.
   The credit may be carried over to future years until used
up, says state Sen. Morgan, who sponsored the bill.
                                                                                                       

   TAX WORK TOPS LIST of most frequent causes of claims filed
against CPA firms, the American Institute of CPAs says. Of
the claims covered by the group's professional liability
insurance plan, 46% were related to tax work while 40%
involved accounting and audit services. Only 3% of claims
were related to business and investment advice.
                                                                                                       

   CHARGE IT] Montana becomes the first state to permit
payment of 1990 personal income taxes with credit cards. A
taxpayer who charges $500 in taxes to a card pays a fee of
$15 to a third party handling the payment. Some states
already allow card payments for certain other taxes, on a
limited basis.
                                                                                                       

   ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS get a tax break if an unrelated
housemate dies, starting next year. The state permits credits
to taxpayers over 65 who earn no more than $37,500, and who
qualify as a head of household, for the person who died
during the preceding two taxable years. The credit is 2% of
taxable income, up to $750.
                                                                                                       

   NOTHING'S FREE: A gift house comes with unpaid taxes on
it.
   John Jennings, a Madison, Conn., self-employed engineer,
filed a return in 1984 but didn't include payment, saying he
won't pay taxes because of his political views. Jennings
successfully rebuffed IRS collection efforts, which included
letters and a visit to his home. A check of land and bank
records also showed Jennings had no assets: He had withdrawn
dividends from his life insurance policy and had transferred
the title to his home to his live-in mate, Darlene Ranno.
   The IRS, claiming that the house was transferred to evade
taxes, went after Ms. Ranno for the tax and interest due on
Jennings's return -- $6,192. She turned to Tax Court, arguing
that the transfer wasn't fraudulent and that the IRS didn't
try hard enough with Jennings. The judge disagreed, finding
the transfer was "constructively fraudulent."
   It was done without regard to whether it would render
Jennings insolvent, the judge said.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: IRS booklet 1544 gives businesses a rundown on
reporting cash transactions over $10,000 . . . Excise taxes
in the 12 months ended June 30 grew to $20.19 billion from
$19.65 billion a year earlier, or about 20% of the more than
$1 trillion the IRS collected in total taxes.

   INTEREST RATES on corporate underpayments of taxes under
the new tax act will increase in 1991 to about 13% from 11%.
The current year's rate was misstated in Wednesday's Tax
Report column, which also misstated the excise tax
proportion, 2%, of total taxes collected by the Internal
Revenue Service in the 12 months ended June 30.
