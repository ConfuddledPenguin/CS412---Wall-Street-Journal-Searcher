   All My Children

   It frightens, it paralyzes,
   It leaves me aghast --
   This manner in which the present
   Surpasses the past:
   The girl who spent two hours
   Powdering her nose
   Earns fifty thousand a year
   Designing offbeat clothes,
   And the lad who flunked arithmetic
   (Too busy with his scooter)
   Becomes another Einstein
   On an electronic computer.
   -- Al Bernstein.

   Empty-Nest Celebration
                                                                                                       

   Our last-born child was wed today,
   And, while we feel the lack,
   There is a bright side, I must say --
   We got our car keys back]
   -- Dick Emmons.
