   Hard-pressed Citicorp is raising the fees it charges for a
wide range of services such as money transfers, part of an
accelerating trend among banks to generate additional fee
income from consumers and small-business clients.
   Most of the new Citibank charges that take effect next
Tuesday represent sizable increases from the last time fees
were changed in 1988. The fees for 11 of the 19 miscellaneous
items on one schedule climb by 25% or more. These include the
charges for a check returned or paid against insufficient
funds, to $12 from $9.50, and for a stop-payment request, to
$15 from $12.

   Some percentage increases are much higher. The charge for
a domestic money transfer goes to $20 from $12, and for large
checks drawn on foreign banks the fee will be $30, up from
$13.
   Banks all across the country are "desperate" for more
income, seeking "to offset declines in loan volume, the loss
in earnings from nonperforming assets and the anticipated
loss in earnings from paying higher deposit insurance fees,"
said Edward Furash, who heads a bank consulting firm, Furash
&amp; Co., in Washington. Mr. Furash said banks were not under as
much pressure in 1990 as they will be next year to find
additional sources of income.
   In addition, the profit margin on traditional interest
income has been shrinking. In the five years ending in 1989,
Sheshunoff &amp; Co. of Austin, Texas, found that the net
interest margin declined 9.8%, while noninterest income
gained 34%. Jack Jacobs, senior vice president, said that
most of the gains were by large banks for "non-repeat
business, such as leveraged buy-out loan fees" -- which have
sharply dropped.
   Mr. Jacobs said he expected more banking companies to
raise fees across the board, as buy-out fee income diminishes
and insurance-fund assessments rise.
   Citicorp has been under particular pressure. Last week, it
said it would post a fourth-quarter loss of $300 million to
$400 million, stemming largely from an increase in commercial
loan-loss reserves and the costs of shrinking its work force
about 8.5% by the end of 1992. Management is also seeking to
slash the company's dividend.
   New York City banks have traditionally charged less for
services than the rest of the country, because the market is
more competitive. In raising its fees, Citibank is "making a
break with New York City and its position in relation to the
rest of the country," said James McDermott, president of the
bank research firm Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.
   "We're really trying to bring our fees back in line with
our costs," said Susan Weeks, a Citibank spokeswoman, in
confirming the fee increases. Asked how Citibank's new fees
stack up against the competition on fees, she said, "We're
all over the map. Some are up to speed, some are higher and
some are lower." Ms. Weeks declined to say how much revenue
would climb as a result of the increases. Citicorp has 1.5
million consumer customers, not all of whom use the services
affected by the increases.
   Citibank also is notifying customers that the monthly fees
for certain stand-alone savings accounts will rise next
Tuesday. The accounts are stand-alone and are charged a fee
if the customer does not have any other Citibank account,
such as a checking account. By raising its fees significantly
-- to $5 per month from $3 for a stand-alone money-market
account below a minimum balance -- Citibank hopes to
encourage more customers to have linked, multiple accounts,
said Ms. Weeks.
   Citibank did not raise its consumer checking fees, but did
increase checking services for its 100,000 small-business and
professional customers. Its per-check charge, paid or
deposited, went to 17 cents from 14 cents. At Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s Chase Manhattan Bank, professionals like doctors pay
15 cents per deposited check and 16 cents per check paid,
said a spokesman, Steven Rautenberg. He added that on overall
fees "there have been no increases lately, and none are
contemplated."
   Chemical Bank recently raised fees in three areas -- money
orders, stop payments and certified checks. The money-order
fee, which went to $3.50 from $2.50, is higher than
Citibank's new $3 charge, but the other two services remain
less expensive. Citibank's new stop-payment charge of $15
compares with $13 at the Chemical Banking Corp. unit and $12
at Chase.
   Citibank will also have a higher fee than its competitors
for checks paid or returned on insufficient funds, $12
compared with $9 at Chemical for each of the first five
bounced checks, and $9.50 at Chase. But compared with the
rest of the country, those fees are modest. The last time
Bank Rate Monitor of North Palm Beach, Fla., surveyed banks,
it found that the average insufficient-funds check charge
nationwide was $16.13.
   Small-business customers were notified of Citibank's new
fee schedule last week. One New York customer, Peter Vandras,
who runs IJS Vending in Woodhaven, Queens, said, "I thought
some of the fee increases were excessive." In comparison to
the previous fee schedule in 1988, "most of the new fees are
going up more than the combined inflation rate since then."
He said he was particularly troubled by the increase for bags
of loose coins, which went to $3 per $100 from 25 cents, and
night deposits, which went to $5 per bag from $2.25.
   In comparison, the cost for a deposited bag of bulk
currency at Chase is $2, but the cost of loose mixed coin is
$6 per bag and loose segregated coin is $3 per bag.
   In raising its fees above the competition in some areas,
Citibank appears willing to lose some business for an overall
income gain. Mr. Furash points out that higher penalties for
bounced checks, for instance, can impose a discipline that
"causes people to watch their accounts more carefully."
   At other institutions, too, fee increases have at times
driven customers away. "It can turn into an emotional issue,"
said Mr. McDermott. "If people feel they are being ripped
off, a fee increase can be the catalyst for shifting a
relationship to another bank."
