   Merger talks between Pan Am Corp. and Trans World Airlines
are beginning to sour.
   Trans World Airlines owner Carl Icahn said yesterday that
Pan Am officials pulled out of a scheduled Monday meeting
concerning his proposed acquisition of Pan Am. But Pan Am
said it hadn't committed to any meeting, and lambasted the
financier for asking them to consider "a series of long
ramblings."

   The spat casts a shadow over the chances of any peaceful
negotiations between Pan Am and Mr. Icahn.
   Mr. Icahn sent a letter to Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett
late Monday, stating he was "troubled and confused by the
attitude" of Pan Am over a merger with TWA. He wrote: "The
conflicting attitudes and signals that we have received from
you and other representatives cause us to wonder whether you
are serious" that a Pan Am-TWA marriage would be a positive
move.
   A Pan Am spokesman, however, said: "We have yet to receive
a definitive proposal from Mr. Icahn." Pan Am executives are
also said to be opposed to a TWA condition that Pan Am file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before TWA gives Pan Am
any money.
   Moreover, it's understood Pan Am is considering a $150
million offer for its lucrative shuttle from PacifiCorp,
based in Portland, Ore. As reported, NWA Inc.'s Northwest
Airlines would operate the shuttle. Completion of the sale
has apparently been complicated by disagreements concerning
whether Northwest would take Pan Am union employees currently
working for the shuttle operations. A sale of the shuttle
would provide Pan Am with the cash infusion it desperately
needs, most probably lessening its interest in a combination
with Mr. Icahn's carrier.
   Mr. Icahn said that on Saturday representatives from both
sides scheduled a Monday meeting at TWA's Mt. Kisco, N.Y.
headquarters to discuss the financing terms on any TWA
purchase of Pan Am. Mr. Icahn has said he is interested in
buying Pan Am's 150 million outstanding shares for $1.50 a
share in cash and $1 a share in subordinated notes. That
comes to $225 million cash and, at the most, $150 million in
subordinated notes.
   Early Monday morning, however, Mr. Icahn said Pan Am
backed out of the meeting, which was apparently scheduled for
11 a.m. EST. It's understood that when Mark Buckstein, TWA's
general counsel, called Richard Francis, Pan Am's chief
financial officer, to confirm the meeting, Mr. Francis told
him Pan Am's team would not attend, and that TWA should send
its term sheet via fascimile transmission. According to
people close to the talks, irked TWA officials, who worked
over the weekend to detail their offer, haven't yet sent the
term sheet.
   The Pan Am spokesman said his airlines' officials were
waiting all day Monday for a definitive TWA proposal before
scheduling further talks, and that if any meeting was missed
with Mr. Icahn it was due to a "misunderstanding."
   Mr. Icahn and his team have mostly been working on how TWA
would provide Pan Am with a bridge loan, short-term financing
that's often repaid with proceeds from the sale of an asset.
In a letter Friday to Mr. Icahn, Mr. Plaskett expressed
support for a TWA-Pan Am merger but only on the condition Pan
Am get a bridge loan.
   Pan Am executives' interest in a merger has dimmed
considerably because Mr. Icahn has been insisting he would
only give Pan Am so-called "debtor-in-possession" financing
that requires New York-based Pan Am to first file for Chapter
11 bankruptcy court protection. That type of financing
typically protects an investor's money in an ailing company
because the investor is usually the first to be repaid before
other creditors.
   Pan Am's Mr. Plaskett is essentially in a race to stay
afloat until he gets government approvals for the second
stage of a $400 million pact with UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines. In that stage, Pan Am would get $290 million by
selling its routes to London's Heathrow airport to United.
   Pan Am was hoping to get bilateral approval from the U.S.
and U.K. governments by year end, but talks between the two
governments stalled late last week and it is likely that the
pact won't be cleared until mid-January, at the earliest.
   Most international routes are governed by bilateral trade
agreements.
   Mr. Icahn claimed in his letter that Mr. Plaskett has
rebuffed other attempts by TWA to merge with Pan Am. In
mid-October, he said Pan Am didn't respond to a TWA merger
proposal that would have involved selling duplicate London
routes to another airline for $800 million. That other
airline is understood to be AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
which just agreed to buy TWA's London operations for $445
million. As previously reported, Mr. Icahn offered Pan Am
bridge financing of $100 million to $125 million. Instead,
Pan Am agreed to sell its London operations and other assets
to United. Mr. Plaskett has said he pursued that pact because
he was looking for a marketing agreement that United was
willing to join. The spokesman said Mr. Icahn never told Pan
Am about any competitor's willingness to buy the London
routes.
   Mr. Icahn said Pan Am ignored another merger proposal in
early November. In his letter, he suggested Monday's rebuff
comes because Pan Am might be able to get cash by selling its
Pan Am shuttle.
   Indeed, Pan Am seems to be buying itself some time. As
expected on Monday, Pan Am received a $20 million advance
from United for San Francisco facilities that are part of the
$400 million pact. Pan Am said the transfer isn't expected to
win clearance from San Francisco city officials until early
next year. Pan Am already has received $80 million for two
jets and $10 million for spare parts. However, most of that
money was spent on debts on the planes, Pan Am said.
   Pan Am is getting hit by its cash crunch. It said on
Monday that A.I. Leasing II, an affiliate of Airbus
Industrie, terminated the leases on 21 Airbus A300 and A310
aircraft because the company's Pan American World Airways
unit hasn't paid $16 million due it. Airbus is an European
aircraft manufacturing consortium.
   Airbus has issued Pan Am a Jan. 20 deadline to relinquish
the use of the aircraft. The original lease wasn't scheduled
to expire for several years. Pan Am said the two parties are
negotiating to enter into new lease agreements to extend use
of the aircraft beyond the Jan. 20 deadline.
   Should the two sides fail to reach a new lease agreement,
"it would be very significant," the Pan Am spokesman said.
"But we have every bit of confidence that we will be able to
further the leases," he said. Without a new accord Pan Am may
face having to cancel many flights.
