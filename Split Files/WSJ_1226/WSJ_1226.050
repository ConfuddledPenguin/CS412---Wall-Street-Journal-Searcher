   'Twas the year that even Santa Claus made do with less.
   Retailers had hoped that a surge of last-minute shoppers
would salvage a bleak season. They stepped up advertising and
discounting and kept their stores open longer than usual. But
receipts for the season slipped below last year's at many
stores, according to analysts and industry executives. And
after adjusting for inflation, which is running in the range
of 2% to 5%, the final tallies are expected to be the worst
in many years.

   "It's been very difficult to get business," said Kenneth
Macke, chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton Hudson
Corp. in Minneapolis. "Consumer confidence is as low as I've
ever seen it."
   "It's been a tough season for most retailers," agreed Jack
McMillan, president of Nordstrom Inc. in Seattle.
   Kurt Barnard, a trade newsletter publisher who surveyed 60
executives of chains and independent retailers, said: "For
most people, it was a struggle just to stay even with last
year. . . . In many cases, retailers have fallen below last
year by as much as 10% or 12%."
   The holiday season is crucial to merchants, who typically
ring up about half of their annual profit in the weeks
between Thanksgiving and Christmas. But this year's sluggish
sales, combined with heavy discounting, are likely to squeeze
industry profits and force some weak chains to seek
bankruptcy-court protection.
   With evidence of a recession mounting and fears of a
Middle East war growing, consumers simply refused to be
coaxed into a spending frenzy. Some shoppers said they
already felt the pinch of rising unemployment and falling
real estate prices. Others were bracing for hard times. And
some were just swearing off the free-spending habit of the
1980s.
   Carolynn McNally, a mother of three from suburban
Riverside, Ill., says her family discovered the fun of
sharing each other's company this year. "You're just as happy
without a ton of stuff under the tree," she asserted while
shopping in Chicago over the weekend.
   Katherine McGee, a graphic designer in Tempe, Ariz., also
was more frugal. On Saturday, she still hadn't bought a gift
for her husband, Jim. But she said she intended to spend less
than last year. "My pocketbook is tighter this year," she
explained, adding that "in the past, my spending was probably
excessive."
   Terry Boyle, a Mabank, Texas, contractor, and his wife,
Rosie, a nurse, decided to spend less this year, too. And
they spent only cash. "We're rebelling against the credit
card society," Mr. Boyle said. "We've already paid off and
torn up two credit cards this year."
   Dayton Hudson's Mr. Macke said shoppers around the country
clearly traded down this Christmas to less expensive gifts.
One indication is that his company's Target discount store
chain did best among Dayton Hudson's divisions, recording a
sales increase of 1% to 2% at stores open at least a year.
The company's Mervyn's chain of low-priced department stores
had "relatively flat" sales, meaning they matched last
year's, Mr. Macke said. But at the company's traditional
Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's department stores,
sales fell 2% to 3% from last year, he said.
   Mr. Macke added that consumers this season stayed away
from "frills" and "frou-frou fashion" items, choosing basic
clothes such as sweatsuits, sweaters, turtlenecks and
practical small appliances such as coffee makers. Some new
fashions were hot, however. Mr. Macke said ties in new
patterns were popular, as were women's stirrup pants and big
sweaters.
   Toy buyers, he said, also seemed to be going back to
basics. Bicycles, dolls and board games sold better than
high-priced electronic games, he said, adding: "The biggest
disappointment across the board is the electronic game
business," primarily Nintendo games, where sales fell by 20%
to 30% from a year ago.
   A spokesman for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., said sales over the
weekend were "much better than our expectations" but results
for the season overall were "slightly below our
expectations." He declined to say whether sales for the
season were better or worse than last year, but retail
consultant Walter Loeb said he expected Sears to match last
year's showing.
   The Sears spokesman called the decision to launch Sears's
usual after-Christmas clearance sale of cold-weather apparel
early this month as "very effective." He said that "sales
increased and we were able to reduce inventories in those
lines."
   Sears also offered more discounts on big-ticket appliances
and electronics and extended its deferred billing deal
through the end of the year. But, with the exception of
home-office equipment such as personal computers, fax
machines and telephones, sales of big-ticket items "continued
to be sluggish," the spokesman said.
   Nordstrom's Mr. McMillan, saying sales at his
department-store chain were running about equal to last
year's, summed up the season this way: "There were plenty of
people in the stores, but they weren't buying as much."
