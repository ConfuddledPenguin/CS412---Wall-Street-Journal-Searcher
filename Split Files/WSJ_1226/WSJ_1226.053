   Business Plans Become
   Tool for More Small Firms

   SMALL BUSINESSES increasingly develop formal business
plans, consultants and others say. These plans, which lay out
long-term strategies and targets for a firm, have been a
common tool of large companies for quite a while.
   "We are definitely seeing a lot more small-business owners
doing business plans," says a spokesman for the National
Federation of Independent Business, a small-business trade
group based in Washington, D.C.
   In the past, observers say, small-business owners
generally only drew up a business plan if they needed to
raise outside money. With times getting tougher, however,
entrepreneurs are using them to become more competitive, says
Mark Smitt, manager of consulting services for McGladrey &amp;
Pullen, an accounting firm that caters to small businesses.
Mr. Smitt says informational seminars by his firm on business
planning draw 60 to 70 clients, several times the number that
shows up for seminars on other topics, such as tax or estate
planning.
   Frank Martin, president of Martin-Harris Construction in
Las Vegas, says his business went for 13 years without any
formal business planning. "We just took on anything and
everything that came up," says Mr. Martin.
   However, growth got out of hand and led to a big 1989 loss
for the company, he says. As a result, the company produced a
formal business plan, laying out how fast it wanted to grow
and what markets it wanted to focus on as well as which ones
it wanted to avoid.
   With much more carefully focused marketing, the company
has returned to profitability despite a souring business
climate, says Mr. Martin. Now he and his managers meet every
two months to review and refine their business plan. "I'm a
100% fan of planning," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Family Companies Seek
   European Investors
                                                                                                       

   FAMILY FIRMS in the U.S. are turning to Europe for
minority investors.
   Francois de Visscher, president of de Visscher &amp; Co., a
Stamford, Conn., consultant, says U.S. firms are being pushed
by the increasing difficulty of raising money in this
country. Their hope is that European companies are becoming
more willing and able to invest in the U.S., says Mr. de
Visscher. Among other reasons, the weaker dollar makes it
less expensive for European companies to make cash purchases.
   Mr. de Visscher says this year he arranged his first two
sales of stakes in U.S. family firms to European companies
and three more such deals are in the works. In one case, a
Swiss drug company paid $17 million for a 40% interest in a
U.S. vitamin company. For the Swiss company, the investment
is tantamount to a joint venture because the two parties also
signed cross-marketing and cross-licensing agreements, says
Mr. de Visscher.
   Even so, some finance specialists say such marriages may
be tough to arrange in large numbers. For one thing, "it's
very difficult for a minority investor to be fully protected
and liquid," says Alain D. Bankier, an investment banker in
the New York office of Banque Nationale de Paris's Banexi
International unit.
   One Banexi client, he says, plans to buy a 33% stake in a
closely held U.S. medical firm. But the buyer is demanding
guarantees it will have majority control in a few years and
veto power over certain decisions until then.
                                                                                                       

   High-Tech Start-Ups
   Lose Lure for Investors
                                                                                                       

   THE INVESTMENT climate for high-technology start-ups
continues to worsen.
   Venture-capital investments in such firms fell to $249
million in the third quarter, down 14% from $290 million in
the year-earlier quarter, reports Technologic Computer
Letter, a New York-based industry newsletter. The decline in
the first six months was only 3.3%.
   Many venture capitalists are conserving their money to
finance additions to existing investments, says Anthony
Hoberman, who invests in venture-capital partnerships for
Alliance Capital Management, New York. "Bank financing for
even the more established companies has all but dried up. And
with little capital forthcoming from initial public
offerings, venture capitalists are being forced to support
their companies with more of their own dollars."
   Venture capitalists say they feel more comfortable in
mature businesses, away from high technology. Prudential
Venture Capital Management, New York, for example, invested
this year in Health Management Associates, a Naples, Fla.,
hospital management company, and Georgetown Leather Inc., a
Washington, D.C., specialty leather products supplier.
   Businesses in financial and health-care services can earn
the same high returns that high-tech companies once did, says
Robert Knox, president of Prudential Venture. Less than 5% of
Prudential's $500 million in assets is currently invested in
high-tech companies.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ERNST &amp; Young found 79% of the 200 entrepreneurs queried
in a recent survey thought the economic climate next year
would be worse than this year. The same survey a year earlier
found 86% expected the coming year would be better. . . . The
most profitable companies in the U.S. are small firms that
have been in business more than 10 years and employ fewer
than 20 people, according to the federal Small Business
Administration. . . . Some 79% of businesses with sales
between $2 million and $100 million provide for a holiday
office party and 51% give gifts to employees, says a survey
by accountants BDO Seidman.
