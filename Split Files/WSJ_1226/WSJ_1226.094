   TOKYO -- Major Japanese trading companies are rushing back
to Vietnam, poised to launch full-scale operations as soon as
Tokyo and Washington give their blessings and resume economic
assistance.
   Of Japan's nine biggest trading companies, Tomen Corp. and
Nissho Iwai Corp. already have offices in Vietnam, and
Kanematsu Corp. is about to open new offices there.
Mitsubishi Corp., Nichimen Corp., Marubeni Corp. and Sumitomo
Corp. are waiting for approvals from Hanoi.

   "Vietnam is a mountain of treasures," says Seisuke Enami,
a senior official at Tomen, which recently signed
joint-venture contracts in Vietnam to produce detergents and
pine resin. The company is conducting feasibility studies,
including plant construction, for an additional 20 to 30
projects.
   The Asian nation is practically virgin territory for
Japanese companies, "so everyone has set their eye on it.
There will be a rush of Japanese companies" seeking business
ties there, adds Kiyoshi Hashimoto, Tomen's executive
director.
   "Making the trek to Vietnam is a boom among Japanese
companies," particularly manufacturing firms, seconds Hiroshi
Kondo, general manager of Meiwa Trading Co., an affiliate of
Mitsubishi. Beyond being wide open in terms of opportunity,
Vietnam also has a good supply of inexpensive labor and
untapped oil reserves.
   Until recently, most of Japan's major trading firms
delegated business with Vietnam to their minor affiliates,
which kept low profiles. For example, Mitsubishi has been
importing crude oil from Vietnam since late 1987, but the
business has been handled through Meiwa Trading, an affiliate
specializing in trade with communist countries.
   Trading companies essentially handle financing and trade
in goods and also work as overseas coordinators for
investments of Japanese companies. Once additional Japanese
trading firms gain entry into Vietnam, their activities are
expected to range widely -- from the development of natural
resources and trading activities, to coordination of joint
ventures between Japanese and Vietnamese companies.
   Until recently, Nissho Iwai was the only major Japanese
trading company with an office in Hanoi. But it couldn't take
full advantage of its unique position because of political
pressure from the U.S. and neighboring Asian countries as
well as the Japanese government.
   Japan, in a joint effort with the U.S. and other allies,
suspended its official economic assistance to Vietnam in the
wake of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978. The aid,
which consisted of 17.5 billion yen (US$129.1 million) in
grants and 10 billion yen in credit, originally had been
extended following Japan's opening of an embassy in Hanoi in
1975.
   The withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia last
year, combined with recent progress in relations between the
U.S. and Vietnam, have brightened chances that the sanctions
may be eased in the near future. Last September, Secretary of
State James Baker and Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach met in New York. It was the first high-level meeting
between a Vietnamese foreign minister and the U.S. since the
Paris talks in the early 1970s held to discuss an end to the
Vietnam War.
   Industry officials say Japan is preparing for the
resumption of economic aid to Vietnam, but they add that
Japan won't precede the U.S. in lifting the economic
sanctions. Some observers had speculated that Washington
would act before the end of this year, but now say the
Persian Gulf crisis has made that unlikely.
   Tomen's Mr. Enami notes that while business opportunities
are vast, Vietnam's roads, harbors, power supply and other
infrastructure have remained in shambles since the war. "Now
the question is whether the {Japanese} government will pay
for" the necessary infrastructure development, the Tomen
official says.
   Most industry officials, including those at Tomen, are
optimistic that Japan will help foot the bill. Once economic
aid is resumed, industry officials believe Japan will provide
very favorable terms to Vietnam for development, partly
because the nation's stability is of strategic interest in
the region.
   "Vietnam is a little bit different {in Japan's eyes} from
a country in other regions. Its stability is necessary for
the stability of all of Asia," said Chuji Kikutani, director
of the quasi-governmental Japan External Trade Organization.
Mr. Kikutani recently visited Vietnam to study the investment
climate.
   Vietnam's newly found oil resources are also attractive to
Japan as Tokyo tries to further diversify its sources of oil.
Vietnam is now producing oil off Vung Tau in a joint venture
with the Soviet Union. It is also exploring several other
areas off the coast jointly with European companies.
   Japan is Vietnam's biggest oil customer. It is also
Vietnam's second-biggest overall trading partner, after the
Soviet Union, and business between the two countries has been
on the rise. Japan's imports from Vietnam in the first nine
months of this year soared 64% from a year earlier,
reflecting increasing imports of oil, to 55.9 billion yen.
Japan's exports to Vietnam, mainly of machinery and
chemicals, jumped 70% to 23.8 billion yen.
   Meanwhile, an acute labor shortage in Japan as well as a
rise in labor costs in other Asian countries provide
additional incentive for Japanese companies looking to invest
in Vietnam. One Japanese trading firm official says labor
costs in Vietnam could be about half of Thailand's. Some
officials predict a move among Japanese companies to shift
additional investment to Vietnam from other Asian countries,
particularly in labor-intensive light industries such as
clothing and food processing.
