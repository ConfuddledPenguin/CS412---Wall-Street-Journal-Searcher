   U.S. Home Corp. said that during the fourth quarter, it
retired $10 million principal amount of subordinated debt and
agreed to retire an additional $11.5 million of subordinated
debt and $7.5 million of senior debt.
   The Houston-based home builder said the agreement involves
two institutional holders and provides for exchanging the
debt for certain real property and mortgage notes not being
used in the current business operations. Completion of the
transactions will result in annual interest savings of more
than $3.9 million, the company said.
