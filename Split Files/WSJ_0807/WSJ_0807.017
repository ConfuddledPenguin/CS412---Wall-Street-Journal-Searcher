   SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said it will close
down its multiwire division after an agreement to sell the
division to Winthrop Investment Corp. fell through.
   Kollmorgen, a maker of motors and electro-optical systems,
didn't elaborate on why it failed to reach a definitive
agreement, after signing a letter of intent for the sale last
month. The company said previously that a closing of the
division wouldn't significantly affect its results.
