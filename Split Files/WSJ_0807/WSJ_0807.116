   Vestron Inc. said it tentatively agreed to be acquired by
Live Entertainment Inc. and will seek the approval of holders
of about $158 million in Vestron debt.
   The proposed acquisition marks the final winding down of
Vestron, a video distributor and movie maker whose fortunes
had soared with the hit movie "Dirty Dancing" only three
years ago. The company ran into debt problems last year after
the videotape market became glutted, as bids for movie rights
skyrocketed, and after $100 million in promised financing for
the company collapsed.

   Terms of the proposed sale weren't disclosed. Vestron's
chairman, Austin Furst, who holds about 85% of Vestron's
common shares, couldn't be reached for comment.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether Vestron, based in
Stamford, Conn., would operate as a separate subsidiary of
Live Entertainment, which is based in Van Nuys, Calif., and
is 48%-owned by Carolco Pictures Inc. Vestron in the past
year has sold overseas video-distribution operations and a
U.S. TV-programming unit. Its remaining assets include
distribution rights to 1,500 titles and the film-sequel
rights to "Dirty Dancing."
