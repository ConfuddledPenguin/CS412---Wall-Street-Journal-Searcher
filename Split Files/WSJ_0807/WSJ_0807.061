   There's at least one silver lining to the tumult in the
Middle East over Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait. For
awhile, we don't have to endure yet more press accounts and
official pronouncements about how the West Bank is the source
of all the problems that attend this region. After the sands
fold over the Iraq problem, it'll be interesting to see if
this small strip of land re-emerges to dominate thinking
about the area.
