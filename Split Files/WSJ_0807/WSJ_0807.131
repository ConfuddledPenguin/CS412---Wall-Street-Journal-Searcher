   Government export insurers and some private insurers could
have billions of dollars at risk in the Persian Gulf if
hostilities in the region escalate further. In addition,
companies seeking to do business there may have to pay dearly
for insurance coverage, if it's still available.
   Insurance rates for shipping through the Persian Gulf have
risen sharply since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last Thursday.
Lloyd's of London, a big British insurance marketer, has led
a world-wide round of price increases for certain oil and
marine coverage. Lloyd's also has posted a war-risk premium
on Persian Gulf shipping for the first time since the
Iran-Iraq war.

   Aside from shipping, companies already doing business in
the region probably won't see their premiums shoot up
immediately. But if the Gulf conflict continues for several
months, their insurance costs could be affected in January,
when insurance renewals are typically negotiated.
   The market for political-risk coverage in Iraq and Kuwait
has virtually shut down, brokers and underwriters said. "I
wouldn't have the audacity to ask an underwriter for a
quote," said Anthony Palmer, a managing director of Berry
Palmer &amp; Lyle, Ltd., a Lloyd's of London broker that
specializes in political-risk coverage.
   Yet, depending on the project and amount of risk involved,
underwriters might still be willing to provide political-risk
coverage for companies seeking business in Saudi Arabia and
other parts of the region, said Ken Horne, a vice president
who heads the political-risk department for Johnson &amp;
Higgins, a New York-based broker.
   Mr. Horne noted that when Chinese army tanks moved to
crush the student protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in
June last year, rates for political-risk coverage in China
virtually doubled overnight. They stabilized within about a
month after the crisis.
   "I wouldn't rule out a 100% rate increase versus {levels
seen} two weeks ago" for political-risk coverage in the
Persian Gulf region, with rates leveling off after a while,
Mr. Horne said.
   Oil and construction companies, manufacturers, exporters
and distributors doing business with Iraq, Kuwait and other
nations in the region tend to buy coverage against such
political risks as an import/export embargo, expropriation or
nationalization of property. But political-risk insurance
generally doesn't cover property damage extending from any
conflict.
   Brokers and underwriters recall that the eight-year
Persian Gulf War cost insurers around the world several
billion dollars, including export guarantees. Marine insurers
alone paid out about $1 billion as a result of that war, the
brokers said.
   Lloyd's, firms in the London insurance market,
underwriters in a few other countries, such as France, and
some U.S. insurers, such as New York-based American
International Group Inc., provide the bulk of political-risk
and marine coverage.
   Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of
American International, said the company has little risk
exposure in the Persian Gulf region. "We have been involved
in the region for many years and we have managed our
exposures quite well. This {situation} will be no exception,"
he said.
   Lloyd's said its underwriters are currently charging an
additional premium of 0.025% of the insured value of ships
traveling in the Persian Gulf. That means owners of a ship
insured for $20 million, a typical value for a supertanker,
will pay $5,000 extra for two weeks' insurance coverage in
the region. Ship owners previously were paying about $10,000
for a full year's coverage.
   Rates can be significantly higher for ships going to
Kuwait, Iraq or northern ports in Saudi Arabia. Insurers are
charging $100,000 extra for a week of coverage in those
areas. Underwriters also are free to demand higher rates if
they judge the risks to be greater.
   Government agencies in the U.S., Britain and several other
European countries provide trade-related guarantees to
exporters.
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank, which provides coverage for
U.S. exporters and banks, has about $80 million to $100
million of potential exposure in Iraq from trade-guarantees
it has offered. However, some Ex-Im Bank guarantees might be
jeopardized by the U.S. government's embargo against Iraq.
Exposure in Kuwait is less than $10 million and about $15
million for Saudi Arabia, an agency official said. The agency
is reviewing its policies for Iraq and Kuwait.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. agency that
insures companies investing in developing nations, said it
covers several projects in Kuwait, but declined to specify
the amount of its exposure. It does no business in Iraq. OPIC
is also active in Saudi Arabia, providing coverage for more
than 12 projects and with total exposure of about $40 million
to $50 million.
   The British Export Credits Guarantee Department, the
British counterpart of the Export-Import Bank, said it
stopped writing new business bound for Iraq in April, when
the Iraqis slid into a payment crisis and the agency started
to see claims. Sources believe that Britain's ECGD has
extended about $1 billion in trade-related guarantees to
Iraq, but the agency didn't confirm this amount.
