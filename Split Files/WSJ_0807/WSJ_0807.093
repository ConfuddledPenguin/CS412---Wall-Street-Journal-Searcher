   WASHINGTON -- Genentech Inc. and Roche Holding Ltd. said
they have certified to the Federal Trade Commission that they
have cooperated with its request to provide additional
information for the proposed merger of the two companies.
   In addition, the companies said they reached an agreement
with FTC officials to extend the waiting period for approval
of the merger until Aug. 31, six days beyond the standard
20-day waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
