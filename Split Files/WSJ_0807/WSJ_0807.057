   Last week, a federal judge invalidated the first-place
primary showing of Sarah Flores, who was favored to win a
November runoff and become the first Hispanic or woman ever
to serve on the powerful Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors. After months of campaigning, she must now start
over and campaign in a court-ordered district that excludes
her hometown and 75% of the voters who backed her.
   Amazingly, Federal Judge David Kenyon first declared the
existing districts invalid in June on the grounds that "an
Hispanic is unable to be elected to the board" under them.
"Judge Kenyon issued that ruling the day before I won 68% of
the Hispanic vote, came in first with Anglo voters and
carried 29 out of 31 cities," says Mrs. Flores. "If I'm not
living proof an Hispanic can win, what is?"

   The truth is the Flores case has a lot more to do with
politics than civil rights. Mrs. Flores may be Hispanic, but
to the local ACLU chapter and the other liberal groups that
filed a civil-rights suit to overturn the district lines she
is the wrong kind of Hispanic. She happens to be a
Republican. Her election would continue a 3-to-2 conservative
majority on the Board of Supervisors. Under the district
lines ordered by Judge Kenyon, the election of a third
liberal Democrat is more or less assured.
   After his June ruling that the district lines
discriminated against Hispanics, Judge Kenyon had three
choices. First, he could have allowed the November election
to take place in a district already 49% Hispanic, with Mrs.
Flores the likely winner. New districts would then have been
drawn using 1990 Census data. The board could even have been
expanded from five to seven districts, from which two
Hispanics might have been elected.
   Alternately, Judge Kenyon could have accepted any one of
six district plans drawn by redistricting expert Bernard
Grofman at the behest of the U.S. Justice Department. All six
included a district that was at least 71% Hispanic. One would
have kept the Flores district more or less intact, and
offered Hispanics a chance to be the deciding vote in two
additional districts. However, the Justice Department
undercut that plan by saying it was flawed for having placed
two Anglo supervisors in the same district. "I'm amused that
in a `civil-rights' case everyone put the interests of an
Anglo male incumbent before those of an Hispanic female,"
Mrs. Flores says. And since when did the government begin to
interpret the Voting Rights Act as protecting the interests
of incumbents?
   In the end, Judge Kenyon, a Jimmy Carter appointee,
rejected all six Justice plans and ordered new elections in
November under lines drawn by the liberal Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), a plaintiff in
the case. The new MALDEF district actually has a lower
Hispanic population than most of the six Justice plans, and
is more grotesquely configured. However, it does create a
third safe Democratic seat. It's as if a sign had been put
up: No Hispanic Republican Need Apply.
   Sarah Flores says she has always beaten tough odds and
promises to run for the new seat. She worked her way out of
poverty by starting as a secretary in county government more
than 30 years ago, eventually rising to become a $63,000 a
year top deputy to a county supervisor. To run for supervisor
she had to quit her job, take out a loan on her house, and
raise more than $400,000 as a first-time candidate.
   But the fate of Sarah Flores is not the major issue here.
It is the working assumption by most of the parties involved
that minority voters can be represented only by someone with
a liberal ideology who is a product of an urban Democratic
Party machine.
   Anyone breaking out of the Liberal Barrio or Plantation
with a different perspective must be, like Sarah Flores or
Bill Lucas before her, crushed politically. The message sent
to others is: If you want to serve in government, toe the
liberal line. Otherwise, you will be tarred as disloyal to
your ethnic group.
   Three federal judges have agreed to hear an appeal and
render a quick decision on the Los Angeles case. We hope they
reject Judge Kenyon's odd argument that the likely election
of an Hispanic candidate should be canceled so that a
different Hispanic can win. The redrawing of district lines
should facilitate democracy, not serve as a back-door means
to frustrate the will of the people.
