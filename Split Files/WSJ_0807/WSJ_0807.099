   WASHINGTON -- Saudi Arabia is emerging as the lynchpin of
the Bush administration's effort to impose sanctions that
would hurt Iraq more than they would damage the fragile U.S.
economy.
   The task presents a dilemma involving hundreds of billions
of dollars. The effort to stop oil flows from Iraq is likely
to send oil prices skyrocketing even further. And surging oil
prices could quickly lead to an economic catastrophe for the
U.S.

   The solution, administration officials have determined,
lies with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, by most estimates, could
increase their production and offset almost half the
shortfall caused by a boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
But convincing them to do so won't be easy.
   "There is very strong doubt they'd be bold enough to
confront another Arab state this way," says Shaul Bakhash, a
Mideast expert and professor of history at George Mason
University. "They {the Saudis} clearly are reluctant to be
seen to be helping the West in this particular way and going
against another Arab country."
   In addition, oil specialists say the administration must
be willing to use its strategic petroleum reserves --
currently 600 million barrels of oil -- to provide a
guarantee that oil price increases won't get out of hand.
That proposal, however, is provoking disagreement within the
administration.
   Some Energy Department officials are apparently willing to
use the strategic reserve to help guarantee that prices don't
rise too high. But the free-marketeers in the Bush White
House fear that's too reminiscent of 1970s-style price
controls, and they are reluctant to sign on even in this
wartime atmosphere.
   Among members of Congress, however, support for using the
strategic reserve to keep prices under control is building
apace. Rep. Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), chairman of a House
energy subcommittee, complains the White House is being too
timid. "It's a philosophy of being afraid to interfere with
the marketplace," he says. "They're afraid to control
prices."
   Eli Bergman, director of an energy policy group called
Americans for Energy Independence, agrees. "This is precisely
the contingency that the strategic petroleum reserve is
supposed to address, so why are they futzing around."
   The administration's anxiety over the economic effects are
evident in the roster of officials summoned to National
Security Council meetings on the Iraqi crisis. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman and
Energy Secretary James Watkins have attended recent meetings.
And yesterday, Michael Boskin, an economic adviser, attended
the meeting as well.
   Iraq and Kuwait together have been exporting about four
million barrels of oil a day. Any successful effort to
embargo or blockade that oil thus would be a serious blow to
world oil markets.
   However, Saudi Arabia has additional production capacity
that it isn't currently using, which could supply between 1.5
million and two million barrels a day in additional oil.
Also, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela each have
600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of excess capacity. If all
three nations boosted their production, they could almost
offset the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   The challenge for the U.S. is to come up with a plan that
will convince the Saudis, in particular, to participate in
such a scheme. That won't be easy. Besides its preoccupation
with a possible Iraqi attack, Saudi Arabia is keen to avoid
appearing to be a puppet of the West.
   Saudi Arabia must take care not to stir up internal
political instability. And it can't antagonize neighbors in
the region with whom it will need to cooperate in later years
-- including the remaining members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, who seemed united in their
determination not to watch their production-limiting pact
unravel.
   "I'm afraid Saudi Arabia is going to find it very, very
difficult. . . . to increase its capacity to make up that
shortfall," said Michael Ameen, a former oil company
executive with extensive experience in the Mideast.
   But even persuading the Saudis and the other swing
producers to play along won't be enough. The U.S. also must
find a way to calm international oil markets. The fear of a
disruption in oil supplies already is leading to increased
demand for oil, as buyers hoard fuel to prepare for a
deepening crisis. Philip Verleger of the Institute for
International Economics calculates that panic buying already
has added another two million barrels a day to oil demand.
   The government's best way to prevent prices from soaring,
analysts say, is to offer to hold out the nation's strategic
oil reserves as a guarantee that oil will remain available at
a reasonable price.
   Administration officials say that option already is under
consideration in White House councils. But they caution that
they are reluctant to use the reserves to try pegging the oil
price at any particular level, because that would mark a
return to the energy price controls of the 1970s.
   The only way to assure an effective shutdown of Iraqi oil
exports, most experts agree, is to use force. A naval
blockade, for instance, could be used to prevent Iraqi oil
from leaving the Persian Gulf, or ports in Turkey and Saudi
Arabia.
