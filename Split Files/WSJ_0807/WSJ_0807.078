   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it will look
into the sudden increases in gasoline prices that followed
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   "We will look closely for any indication that these
increases may be the result of anticompetitive activity,"
said James Rill, head of the department's antitrust division.

   Mr. Rill's statement followed an outcry from the White
House, scores of members of Congress and state attorneys
general around the country attacking oil companies.
   Despite the strong rhetoric, however, there's little the
government can do if it can't show some sort of collusion in
the oil industry.
   The federal government dismantled the last controls over
gasoline prices in 1981, and there is little interest in
Congress for reimposing them. There were a few calls for
price controls earlier in the year when congressional panels
focused attention on a spurt in heating oil prices.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the agency would
monitor prices, but said, "We at DOE have no authority to
dictate prices, nor should we."
   "We do not have any price control system now," said Rep.
Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), chairman of the House energy
subcommittee who is convening a hearing into energy prices
today. "The president ought to be focusing on some jawboning
with the oil companies."
   In response to reporters' questions yesterday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "It's not clear that all of
the increases that have been reported at the consumer level
are necessary, and we would certainly urge . . . all
companies not to be anticipatory."
   Gasoline prices at service stations across the country
spurted almost as quickly as Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait.
Prices jumped an additional seven cents a gallon over the
weekend, bringing the four-day average national increase to
11 cents since Mideast hosilities put oil markets in turmoil.
   The average price for regular unleaded climbed to $1.186 a
gallon, according to a spot check of 1,400 service stations
by the American Automobile Association. While the increases
were across the board, California may have the biggest
advances, with prices up 12 to 15 cents.
   Gasoline price-increases are being initiated at all points
in the supply chain, from refiners to wholesalers to corner
stations, in step with soaring commodity market quotes. More
increases may be in store; gasoline futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose more than nine cents a gallon
yesterday.
   The supply of gasoline hasn't significantly changed, and
much of the fuel currently for sale has been in inventory.
But oil experts say that when Iraq invaded Kuwait last week,
the same nervousness about possible supply disruptions that
touched off panicky crude-oil buying also hit gasoline
markets, leading to the rise in pump prices.
   Like many consumers, members of Congress complained that
the prices moved before the events in the Middle East had any
impact on U.S. oil supplies.
   But the day-to-day price of oil -- and even of gasoline
and other refined products -- is heavily influenced by
futures-market traders who buy and sell contracts on
speculation about future price moves. When prices are rising,
the changes often hit the gasoline pump immediately because
wholesalers and retailers have the ability to sell their
supplies through exchanges at the futures-market price.
   "There's no conspiracy," said Philip Verlanger of the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington think
tank. "It is the market at work."
   Nevertheless, House and Senate committees called hearings
for today into energy prices, and there was congressional
pressure on the Bush administration to tap the U.S. strategic
petroleum reserve. More than two dozen senators signed a
letter to President Bush asking him to convene a special
federal task force to monitor gasoline prices and recommend a
response.
   "Across the board, the big oil companies have gone on a
feeding frenzy," said Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), chairman
of the Senate consumer subcommittee, which also scheduled a
hearing for today. "This isn't panic. This is greed."
   But Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.), who spent years
battling oil companies when he was attorney general in
Connecticut, acknowledged yesterday that the government's
legal options "are not enormous." Besides a Justice
Department antitrust investigation, the Federal Trade
Commission could investigate unfair trade practices.
   Although there has been a surplus of oil in world markets,
the Energy Department said that at last tally, U.S. gasoline
stocks were "slightly below the lower limit of the average
range for the last three years." As of July 27, the nation
had 217.8 million barrels of gasoline on hand, 10.1% below
the same date last year.
