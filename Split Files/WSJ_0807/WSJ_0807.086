   Benazir Bhutto was toppled as the first woman leader of an
Islamic country, after 20 tumultuous months as Pakistan's
leader.
   In a move that surprised Pakistan and Miss Bhutto's
government, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the
National Assembly on Monday and declared a state of
emergency, saying the government was ineffective and corrupt.

   "The government willfully undermined and impaired the work
of the constitution," Mr. Ishaq Khan said. "Corruption and
nepotism in the federal government has reached such
proportions that the orderly functioning of the government no
longer carries public faith and credibility."
   President Ishaq Khan appointed Miss Bhutto's main
political rival, Mustafa Jatoi, as caretaker prime minister
and scheduled national elections Oct. 24. Four other
politicians, including a member of Miss Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party, were named to a caretaker cabinet.
   The Pakistan army took over the national television
station and telephone exchanges, and spread troops throughout
the capital. But army Chief of Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg
said the army wasn't taking control. "We are not going to get
involved," he said.
   The state of emergency, declared early Monday morning,
suspends certain individual rights. Miss Bhutto on Monday
warned her supporters not to resort to violence.
   At a news conference, Miss Bhutto called the assembly's
dissolution "illegal and unconstitutional" and labeled the
charges against her government a "slander campaign." She also
said the army had surrounded her Islamabad residence.
   But her press secretary, Kamran Shafi, said Miss Bhutto
wanted the elections to be held in October, adding, "She's
absolutely certain the PPP will come in with a bigger
majority."
   The big question is whether Mr. Ishaq Khan actually will
hold elections. If he does, Miss Bhutto's political rivals
will have a huge advantage in competing against a prime
minister dismissed for ineffectiveness and corruption. If the
poll isn't held, Miss Bhutto may prove to be the victim of a
military coup camouflaged by promises of elections.
   Mr. Ishaq Khan, who became president after the death of
Gen. Mohammad Zia ulHaq in 1987, maintains close ties with
the military. In 1977, when Gen. Zia overthrew then Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Miss Bhutto's father, he
promised elections that weren't held for eight years, and
finally occurred only under an altered constitution. In 1979,
Gen. Zia ordered Mr. Bhutto's hanging after the former prime
minister had been convicted of ordering the murder of a
political foe.
   In dissolving the assembly Monday, Mr. Ishaq Khan probably
was acting within his power under the 1973 constitution that
Gen. Zia amended in 1985 to strengthen the power of the
president. The constitution says the president "may also
dissolve the National Assembly at his discretion where, in
his opinion, an appeal to the electorate is necessary." Miss
Bhutto probably will challenge the order in court.
   Mr. Ishaq Khan's charges against Miss Bhutto and her
government will ring true to many Pakistanis. She inherited
serious problems when she became prime minister in 1989,
including widespread poverty, ethnic chaos, tension with
neighboring India and a restive military that has held power
for most of Pakistan's 43-year history.
   But Miss Bhutto proved an ineffective and sometimes
diffident leader, making worse some of the problems she
inherited. For nearly a year, Miss Bhutto's government
concentrated on political survival in the National Assembly,
where she ruled in a coalition. Even after she survived a
no-confidence vote last November and won over enough
assemblymen to command a thin majority -- 137 of 237 seats --
she wasn't able to control the country.
   In particular, her government was powerless to stop
widespread rioting in June in two cities in Sindh, her home
province. Miss Bhutto finally had to ask the army to move in
to restore order.
   Allegations of corruption were leveled against Miss
Bhutto's ministers, party associates and even her husband,
businessman Asif Zardari. Miss Bhutto and her husband denied
the charges.
   Her poor record will give some legitimacy to President
Ishaq Khan's decision to sack Miss Bhutto and dissolve the
National Assembly. At the same time, analysts said, his
timing should be ideal for Miss Bhutto's electoral
challengers, coming so soon after her failure in Sindh
province. Miss Bhutto wasn't required to call elections until
1994.
   Many of Miss Bhutto's party members in the assembly have
expressed fears about an early election, saying they have no
achievements to show voters. In 20 months in power, the
government has passed no legislation except the federal
budget.
   Miss Bhutto's relationship with the army also has
deteriorated. Earlier in the year, she and the army were
cooperating on policy toward Kashmir, the violence-wracked
province claimed by both Pakistan and India. The two
countries came close to war, but the crisis brought together
the ruling triad of Pakistan: Miss Bhutto, the army and
President Ishaq Khan.
   The crisis in Sindh fractured that alliance. The army
faulted Miss Bhutto for not solving it by political means and
noted that supporters of her own party were involved in
violent clashes there that have claimed more than 400 lives
since late May.
