   It's Saturday afternoon at the Fort Worth Town Center
mall, a time when security guards go on red alert. Suddenly,
three suspicious characters approach the main entrance.
   A burly officer plants himself in front of the ringleader.
"How old are you?" he demands.

   "Um, 15," says a startled, pale girl in a white T-shirt.
Her two friends are 14 years old. That's enough for the
officers. They swiftly send the would-be shoppers packing,
their ponytails bobbing in the wind.
   Although teen-agers constitute some of its biggest
customers, in June the Fort Worth, Texas, mall began barring
the under-18 set on Saturday afternoons unless an adult comes
along. The reason: juvenile rowdiness. Last year alone,
love-struck teen-age boys started four fistfights over girls.
Others drew retailers' wrath by massing in front of doors and
window displays.
   Town Center isn't alone. Fed up with skateboards thrown
through plate glass, shoplifting and what sometimes seems the
congenital surliness of teens, retailers around the country
are resorting to increasingly extreme measures to control
teen-age shoppers.
   They range from outright bans to subtler means of warfare
-- as convenience stores, for example, try to become less
teen-friendly by removing loitering spots. Some favor the
velvet-glove approach and hire security guards versed in
adolescent psychology.
   But the new tactics carry new dangers. For one thing,
stores risk alienating some of America's biggest spenders:
Last year, adolescents shelled out at least $31 billion on
everything from T-shirts to T-Birds. What's more, some of the
methods raise questions about fairness. Critics charge that
racism plays a part in some of the controls, while others
warn about the dangers of punishing everyone in an age
category for the misbehavior of a few.
   "If a 40-year-old got in a fight, would you ban all
40-year-olds?" asks Robert L. Sorensen, vice president of
property management for Hahn Co., a San Diego-based mall
developer that doesn't endorse any sort of special teen
restrictions.
   The measures strike many youth advocates as particularly
ironic, since mall developers spent millions over the years
trying to recreate a pleasant, Main Street-style atmosphere
that makes shoppers want to congregate. Now that
mall-wandering has replaced cruising the strip as young
America's favorite pastime, it seems the rules are changing.
   "I'm stuck," said David Dawkins, a 15-year-old who was
once a regular visitor to the Fort Worth Town Center. "Where
do they expect me to hang out for the next three years, huh?"
   Nevertheless, jilting kids didn't appear to hurt the Town
Center. Although sales dipped initially, the mall says June
revenue rose about 18%, according to preliminary figures.
Some retailers link their sales rise directly to the
restrictions. Daniel Cetina, the mall's manager, says
teen-agers still come on Saturdays -- but now, they drag
along their parents, who shop as well.
   Even at the Take Ten video arcade, a traditional teen
hangout, where June revenue plummeted 17%, employees aren't
complaining. "I think it's better," says Jeannie Lemley, a
clerk. "Before, the little kids and their parents wouldn't
come in because the big kids wouldn't let them play."
   But some retailers remain unconvinced. "It's dead in
here," grumbles Donnie Vasquez, assistant manager of T-Shirts
Plus, which caters to youthful tastes for Bart Simpson
cartoons and other designs. "I don't think it's fair."
   At ParkFair Mall in Omaha, Neb., the decision to ban
unaccompanied teen-agers every weekday after 2 p.m. was even
easier. Besides fast-food shops, none of ParkFair's stores
target the youth market. Instead, the center's high-end
clothiers have been focusing increasingly on maturing
baby-boomers for sales.
   So earlier this year, when students from nearby Central
High School twice got into fistfights in the food court --
and even injured police officers trying to break up one brawl
--- it was bye-bye brats. "Our customers expect a restaurant
atmosphere, not a cafeteria atmosphere," said Michael Wiese,
vice president of Metro Center Realvest Corp., a unit of
Omaha Development Foundation, which owns ParkFair.
   For malls that do rely heavily on teens for business, the
decision to bar them can be tougher. At Hamburg, N.Y.'s
McKinley Mall, owned by George D. Zamias Inc. of Johnstown,
Pa., retailers resisted any restrictions -- until last
February, when a turf fight erupted among hundreds of
students from rival high schools, leading to more than a
dozen arrests. Now, unescorted youths are prohibited Friday
and Saturday nights.
   As it turned out, McKinley's retailers needn't have
worried: With kids out of the way, adults have begun coming
back to the mall. Except for the game arcade, where sales
plunged 50%, all the other stores have seen revenue jumps of
3% to 8%. "We've brought back the adult person who does spend
the money," says Edward D. Dallape, Zamias's vice president
of operations.
   But many mall owners refuse to resort to such drastic
measures. Some are afraid of bad publicity, while others
worry that bans could be unconstitutional. "You always get
complaints," says Michael Murphy, spokesman for Melvin Simon
&amp; Associates Inc., an Indianapolis shopping center developer.
"You can't exclude a whole sector of your buying public
because of isolated problems from one age group."
   Actually, most bans probably don't violate any laws, since
malls are privately owned, says Colleen O'Connor, a
spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Still, a security program that singles out unruly people
for attention carries its own dangers. Dallas's Red Bird
Mall, owned by Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., was threatened with
a boycott by minorities earlier this summer because,
activists say, guards picked on black and Hispanic kids. Even
minority adults said they got harassed: One black store
manager was asked to leave by a security officer who didn't
recognize him.
   As a result of the protests, Red Bird fired its security
chief, signed up guards for the police department's
sensitivity course and began giving work to minority
contractors. The boycott threat was dropped.
   Other retailers have also found that kinder, gentler
methods work better. Guards at New York-based O'Connor
Group's Singing River Mall in Gautier, Miss., have a new job
title: "Ambassadors of Good Will." It's a similar story at
North Mountain Village in Phoenix, Ariz. There, William Moody
-- property manager for the owner, Western Investment
Management Co. in Cupertino, Calif. -- makes it a point, when
talking to kids, to roll up his sleeves to reveal
skateboarding scars. "Afterwards, they're not terrorizing the
site -- just sort of hanging out in front of the Burger
King," he says.
   Randall Park Mall in North Randall, Ohio, and Regency Mall
in Augusta, Ga., both owned by DeBartolo, take the
friendly-watchdog concept one step further. They hire local
youths to walk around, cut off rowdiness and aid confused
shoppers. The job calls for them to be perky and "full of
smiles," says Lynn Pace, Regency Mall assistant manager.
   Corny though it sounds, such co-opting seems to work, Ms.
Pace says. A teen who goes to Randall Park Mall every weekend
said she finds the center's "hospitality teams" more helpful
than annoying. "They're kind of half teacher's pets, but once
you get to know them, they're OK," says Dawn Winguard, 17.
   Meanwhile, a few of Southland Corp.'s 7-Eleven stores have
removed window ledges and flat-topped trash cans used as
perches by young loiterers. Others modified their pay phones
so they don't ring; that prevents kids from hanging around
and taking calls.
   And Canadian 7-Elevens have gone one step better. Ten
outlets there blast syrupy tunes like "Moon River" to scare
away teens.
