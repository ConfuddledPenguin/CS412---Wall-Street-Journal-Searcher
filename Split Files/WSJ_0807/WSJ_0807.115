   TOKYO -- Iraq's conquest of Kuwait has stock markets
reeling around the world. But in Tokyo, stocks are taking
their second big drubbing this year.
   Indeed, some analysts now fear that the Tokyo stock market
is headed for a repeat of the plunge that wiped out about 28%
of the exchange's value in the first quarter.

   Amid growing concern about the instability in the Middle
East, the impact of higher oil prices and the possibility of
a monetary tightening by Japan's central bank, the Nikkei
average of 225 big stocks was off sharply Monday and Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the indicator was down 1327.67 points,
or 4.6%, at 27271.86 at the close of the morning session.
Monday, the index had tumbled 916.23 points, or 3.1%, to
28599.53.
   At its levels Tuesday morning, the index now is 11,644.01
points, or 30%, below its record high of 38915.87 set on the
last trading day of 1989. It also is below the previous low
of this year of 28002.07, reached April 2.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 150 million
shares, down from an estimated 170 million shares Monday.
   Of the traded issues, losers outnumbered gainers 563 to
six, while 10 issues remained unchanged.
   "It's tough to see anything right now," said Mike
Morizumi, a strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc.
"There are no cyclical patterns to look at."
   Japan's bond market also took a beating Tuesday morning,
with yields on the No. 119 benchmark 10-year government bond
climbing for the first time above 8%. That means the gap
between the bond yield and the earnings yield on Japanese
stocks, which now averages about 2.2%, is almost at an
unprecedented 6%, Mr. Morizumi said, adding: "Hopefully, this
won't last."
   There are similarities between Tokyo's earlier downturn
and the current one. Stocks have been highly volatile --
partly, some brokers say, because of computerized program
trading. And the fear of higher interest rates is driving
down the stock market.
   It was the Bank of Japan's decision to raise the discount
rate that turned a record-setting stock market rally in
December into a nosedive in January. The decline accelerated
in March after the central bank announced another increase in
the discount rate, which is the fee it charges on loans to
financial institutions.
   Now concern is growing about yet another rate increase.
Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday, worries about
higher rates were undermining Japanese stocks. Japan's
economy is booming at about a 7% to 8% annual rate; money
supply growth is accelerating; and there is an acute labor
shortage in the country. In addition, a weak yen has been
contributing to inflationary fears. In response to these
factors, market interest rates have been climbing steadily to
where the yield on the government's benchmark 10-year bond is
at 7.94%, up from 6.75% in early July.
   The invasion of Iraq has all but ensured an increase in
the discount rate, economists say, by driving up world oil
prices.
   Japan depends on imported oil for 58% of its energy needs,
and any increase in oil prices could translate into
inflationary pressures. To avert those pressures, economists
say, the Bank of Japan is likely to raise the discount rate
-- it currently stands at 5.25% -- soon. The central bank has
no policy meeting scheduled for this week, but analysts don't
rule out an emergency decision.
   The timing of a rate increase, though, is critical. "We
don't know what would be appropriate," said Mikio Fujino, an
institutional salesman at Nikko Securities Co., "but it's
very, very important that it doesn't come too early to be
effective or too late to stop inflation."
   Analysts say the Japanese stock market has already
adjusted fairly well for the expected increase, even if it
proves to be as big as a full-percentage-point jump in the
discount rate. Still, investors are alarmed by events in the
Mideast because the investors fear that more conflict could
lead to tighter oil supplies and higher prices. That would
feed inflation in Japan -- and might prompt even another
interest-rate increase.
   "The invasion was bad timing for Japan," said Pelham
Smithers, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc. "The
market had expected a short-term fluctuation in interest
rates, but now we have to make a correction for the new bad
news, plus continue the adjustment for what had already
happened."
   If the discount rate is raised, yen-denominated Japanese
government bonds would become relatively more attractive to
big Japanese institutional investors than U.S. Treasury
bonds, which are denominated in dollars and thus carry a
foreign-exchange risk for the Japanese. A quarterly auction
of $32.5 billion in Treasury debt instruments is scheduled
this week. To attract Japanese money, U.S. interest rates
might have to move higher even if there isn't a discount rate
increase in Japan, because market rates in Tokyo recently
have been rising, analysts say.
   With that background, reasons Mamoru Yamazaki, an
economist at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., "if the Bank of Japan will
raise the {discount rate}, it will be after the U.S. Treasury
auction."
   An increase in Japanese rates would hamper any easing of
credit by the U.S. central bank and might help send the U.S.
into a recession. Japanese government economists said they
aren't worried, however. Shousuke Tanaka, director-general of
the Economic Planning Agency, said that "even if there were a
recession in the U.S., I feel there would be very small
direct impact on Japan." Domestic corporate investment and
consumer demand are growing fast enough, he said, to sustain
Japanese economic growth. Economists point out that Japan's
economy is more efficient and more resilient than it was
during the oil shock of the 1970s.
   Mr. Tanaka also doubts that higher oil prices will have a
long-term impact on Japan's economy, and other economists
share his view. Stock market participants, however, remain
wary.
   "There is no ability to forecast what will happen in the
Middle East, and people tend to take the worst scenario,"
said Yutaka Nakai, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. "We
don't fear panic selling, but there aren't many fundamentals
to be optimistic about right now."
   In yesterday's trading, volume on the first section was
estimated at 330 million shares, down from 431 million shares
Friday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 997 to 30, while 34
issues were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed in the first section slumped 76.14 points, or
3.50%, to 2098.53.
   The second section index plunged 198.40 points, or 4.51%,
to 4199.05. Volume in the section was estimated at 11 million
shares, down from 28.3 million shares Friday.
   Meanwhile, the Frankfurt market's DAX Index dropped 5.4%,
to 1740.93, off 100.01 points, and London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was down 2.8%, to
2220.2, a decline of 64.4 points.
   Although West Germany gets less than 2% of its oil from
Iraq and Kuwait, the country still is heavily dependent on
oil imports. Britain, as an oil producer-exporter, is
somewhat cushioned from the current crisis.
   "The potential downside risk on the U.K. is probably less
than on any other major market," said Martin Paling,
international investment strategist at James Capel &amp; Co. in
London.
   But given the political and military uncertainties in the
gulf, few experts would predict near-term stock market
performance. "You don't know where an index goes in a war --
flip a coin, spin a wheel, throw the dice," said Thomas R.
Holmes, manager of institutional sales at Schroeder
Muenchmeyer Hengst &amp; Co. in Frankfurt.
   Added Mr. Paling: "The two big imponderables are how high
the price of oil will go, and how long the price will stay
up."
   The declines in London and Frankfurt were broadly based,
with few major stocks able to counter the trend. In late
trading in London, British Petroleum gained 2 pence to 367
pence ($6.81), but big losers included Imperial Chemical
Industries, down 52 pence to 958 pence; Rothmans, off 45
pence to 719 pence; Glaxo, down 25 pence to 762 pence; B.A.T,
down 30 pence to 541 pence, and Thorn EMI, off 24 pence to
680 pence.
   In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank closed at 755 marks, down 44
marks ($474.54, down $27.66); Daimler-Benz, at 771.50 marks,
down 63 marks; Lufthansa, at 136 marks, down 11 marks;
Porsche, at 1076 marks, down 56 marks, and Siemens, at 688
marks, down 36.50 marks.
   The steep drops prompted some big investors to venture
bets that the bottom is near. "We did a wee bit of buying on
the {price} falls -- we aren't unduly worried," said James C.
Fisher, a fund manager for Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers Ltd. in Glasgow.
   Mr. Fisher said that on Friday and yesterday, Scottish
Amicable bought B.A.T, Glaxo and Hanson shares. "We saw an
opportunity to pick up cheap stock," he said. "Our market
will be supported by fundamentals. It won't go much lower. I
suspect we may get a bounce {upward} from here. But then
again, a lot depends on the gulf situation."
   Meanwhile, shares closed lower in Paris, Stockholm, Milan,
Madrid, Zurich, Amsterdam and Brussels. South African gold
stocks closed narrowly mixed. And stocks ended lower in
Sydney, Taipei, Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul, Manila and
Wellington.
