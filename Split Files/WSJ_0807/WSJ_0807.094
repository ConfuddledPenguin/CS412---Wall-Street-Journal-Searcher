   NEW YORK -- The U.S. subsidiary of Nomura Securities Co.
will be fined $180,000 and censured by the New York Stock
Exchange for alleged violations of exchange rules, according
to people familiar with the case.
   A hearing is scheduled for today to examine a settlement
surrounding allegations that Nomura Securities International
Inc., the U.S. unit of the giant Japanese securities firm in
1987 violated net capital requirements. These involve
situations where a firm allows its net capital to fall below
levels prescribed by the exchange.

   People familiar with the case said the violations were
relatively small, involving several hundred thousand dollars.
   As in most disciplinary cases, Nomura will settle without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, according to individuals
familiar with the case. A Nomura spokesman declined to
comment; so did an exchange spokeswoman.
   While not the biggest fine, the penalty would be one of
the steepest leveled against a Big Board member firm. Since
1987, the exchange and other "self-regulators" of the markets
have been under increased pressure to impose stiffer fines
for violators of market rules.
   Last month, the New York Stock Exchange censured American
Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit and fined it
a record $500,000 in a case involving Shearson's trading of
E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. stock during 1986 takeover talks.
