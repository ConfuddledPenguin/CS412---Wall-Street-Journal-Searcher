   Is the executive pay spiral slowing?
   It could be.

   Compensation specialists say Paul Fireman's startling pay
cut at Reebok International Ltd. could create a ripple effect
in other boardrooms.
   Reebok's chairman and chief executive officer has been one
of the most visible beneficiaries of the past decade's boom
in corporate largess. His pay has averaged $13.6 million a
year over the past four years. But at the end of July, a new
five-year contract capped Mr. Fireman's annual cash payment
at $2 million-$1 million in salary and a bonus of as much as
$1 million, depending on Reebok's profit performance.
   Many companies in recent years have been edging toward
using more stock and less cash to compensate top executives,
and Mr. Fireman's example could speed that trend along. While
the chief executive gets a huge stock-option grant under his
new contract, Reebok has made it tougher than usual to profit
on those options. For Mr. Fireman just to match his earnings
under his previous contract, which paid him a percentage of
corporate net income, the company's stock price would have to
grow at nearly twice the average rate for companies in
general, analysts and compensation experts estimate.
   "Ten years ago, we saw performance plans in which
performance could be readily reached," says an
executive-compensation specialist at Union Pacific Corp.
"Today, companies are willing to pay more to get more." Mr.
Fireman, who with his wife owns 15% of the footwear concern's
stock, declined repeated requests for interviews, and a
Reebok spokeswoman wouldn't comment.
   One reason the highly visible switch by Reebok is expected
to be influential is that compensation negotiations will soon
be starting at companies across the country. "There's a great
deal of me-tooism in executive compensation," says Gordon
Wolf, a vice president at consultants Towers Perrin.
   Alan Johnson, compensation specialist at recruiters Handy
Associates, agrees. "The pressure is continuing to increase"
to tie executives' compensation more closely to corporate
performance, he says, adding: "No one wants to show up on a
list of overpaid executives."
   The Reebok situation, to be sure, has some elements
peculiar to it. Reebok's growth has slowed considerably as
rival Nike Inc. has overtaken it. And compensation experts
see the shift in Mr. Fireman's package as the normal passage
of a small, entrepreneurial venture into the world of
big-company compensation. While profit-sharing arrangements
are common at smaller ventures, only a few larger ones --
like Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc. -- offer them.
   "Fireman is moving from a position of uniqueness to one
that is more normal," says Graef Crystal, a compensation
specialist and adjunct professor of business administration
at the Haas School of Business, University of California at
Berkeley. En route, consultants note, Mr. Fireman's pay pact
was modified once before, to cut the share of corporate
profit to which he was entitled.
   Still, compensation consultants maintain that Reebok's
previous pay package presented several problems of a kind
that companies are increasingly under pressure to correct.
Among them:
   -- Out-of-Proportion Pay: Many feel that a highly
controversial $550 million bonus -- based on a percentage of
profit -- to Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond specialist
Michael Milken marked a psychological turning point for many
companies. "People looked at what happened with Mike Milken,
who had a formula that never was changed, and said we can't
let that happen here," says Mr. Johnson of Handy. While Mr.
Fireman's case was by no means that extreme, Mr. Johnson
calls it a "well-intentioned formula being distorted by the
great success of the company."
   -- Drain on Corporate Cash: Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., estimates that Mr. Fireman's new
pay package will save the company about six cents a share
compared with his previous pact. In today's austere climate,
"people are acutely sensitive to the money people make on
annual pay," Mr. Johnson says. By contrast, he adds: "There's
not very much sensitivity to equity. There's no rumbling at
all about the billions Bill Gates has made {through
appreciation of the stock he owns} at Microsoft."
   -- Paying for Low Performance: Although most companies say
their pay plan pays for performance, in practice it often
doesn't work out that way. Because he shared in corporate
profit above a certain threshold, Mr. Fireman took home huge
bonuses even when corporate results soured. Reebok's stock
price has been flat over the past several years, and in 1988,
when earnings dropped 17%, Mr. Fireman's bonus dropped, too
-- to $11.1 million from $15.1 million.
   One novel aspect of Mr. Fireman's new pay package that
compensation experts see creeping into other plans is the use
of so-called premium-priced stock options. Stock options give
the right to purchase a share of stock in the future at a
price fixed today. Normally, that price is the market price
on the date the option is granted. Sometimes, options are
even granted at a discount to market price, giving executives
a potential profit right away.
   The 2.5 million options granted under Mr. Fireman's new
contract, however, have exercise prices an average of 18%
higher than Reebok's current market price.
   Mr. Crystal at Berkeley figures that to match the previous
bonus arrangement, Mr. Fireman would have to preside over a
stock-price appreciation exceeding 24% a year for the 10
years the options are exercisable. Since World War II, he
notes, the compounded return on stocks in general has been
about 14%.
   Some other companies have also added similar strict
provisions. Under a 10-year contract that expires in 1998,
Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, gets options on two
million shares, 500,000 of them priced at $10 above the
market price on the date they were granted.
   At Union Pacific, an executive-incentive program begins to
pay off only after the stock price hits $100, nearly double
its value when the plan was designed. "It's a very ambitious
plan," says the Union Pacific compensation official. "We
looked for a program that had a high performance hurdle."
   Compensation specialists say they hope others will follow.
Giving premium options "sends a powerful signal to the
investment community" about a company's expectations for
growth, asserts Louis Brindisi Jr., chairman of Strategic
Compensation Associates.
   "I'd like to see more of it," says Mr. Crystal.
   Still, many expect a slow, painful process. "We are
passing the castor-oil bottle," Mr. Crystal adds. "This is
not a nice goodie." Others note that when companies adopt
unusual or risky pay provisions, they are often simply
additions to existing programs, not replacements. That is
true at Union Pacific, where the company also offers
traditional stock options.
