   DETROIT -- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resulting
jump in gasoline prices couldn't have come at a worse time
for car makers, particularly the Big Three.
   The sudden return of recession fears, oil embargo threats
and accelerating gasoline prices is catching product planners
at American and Japanese auto makers leaning the wrong way --
toward bigger, more powerful and less fuel-efficient cars and
trucks.

   Detroit's cars are far more efficient than the gas
guzzlers of a decade ago, but Japanese auto makers still have
the edge if American consumers become mileage-conscious
again.
   Japanese car makers have the advantage not just in raw
miles-per-gallon numbers. They also have used their lead in
small engine technology to develop four-cylinder cars that
have the pep of an American six-cylinder. In short, they can
offer consumers more models that blend economy and
performance.
   What's more, Japanese car companies have quicker product
cycles than their U.S. rivals and thus could respond faster
to market changes or renewed regulatory pressure to cut
reliance on imported oil by raising fuel economy standards,
industry analysts say.
   "Everybody is in better shape than 10 years ago," says
analyst Christopher Cedergren of J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a
market research firm. "But the Japanese still are in better
shape than the American manufacturers."
   A slowdown in the U.S. economy also could give Japanese
car makers an even larger share of the U.S. market. "You'd
not only have a decline in total vehicle sales but you'd have
a bias toward smaller cars," said David Healy, an analyst
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   A shift toward smaller cars could be particularly damaging
to General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which derive much
of their profits from big cars. GM and Ford each spent
millions of dollars recently to restyle their large,
low-mileage, rear-wheel drive cars so they could remain
competitive -- and add to the corporate bottom line -- well
into the 1990s.
   Although gasoline prices surged after last week's invasion
of Kuwait by Iraq, it is still unclear what longer-term
impact the gulf crisis will have on prices and supplies. But
whatever happens, policy makers, already concerned about the
high use of imported oil, will have a stronger argument to
demand tougher automobile fuel economy standards.
   The car industry has been backsliding on fuel economy for
the past two years. After greatly improving between 1975 and
1988, the mileage of the average car dropped to 27.8 miles
per gallon in the current model year from 28.6 miles per
gallon in 1988, according to a study by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Japanese car makers accounted for much of that drop, the
EPA found. A decade ago, Japanese manufacturers sold almost
entirely small, fuel-sipping economy cars. But now, Honda
Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Corp. and some of
the smaller Japanese companies all are offering larger, more
powerful models in an effort to push into the mainstream of
the U.S. market.
   Nissan and Toyota unveiled luxury cars this past fall with
V-8 engines more powerful than any offered by Cadillac or
Lincoln. Toyota's 250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 gets 18 miles
to the gallon in city driving. That's only slightly better
than the 17 miles to the gallon achieved by the larger
Lincoln Town Car.
   But while the Japanese were pushing into the larger car
market, they also continued to refine their four-cylinder
engine technology.
   Consider the Toyota Camry and the Ford Taurus. The Camry's
four-cylinder base engine has 115 horsepower and delivers 26
miles per gallon in city driving. The Taurus's four-cylinder
base engine has a mere 90 horsepower and delivers only 20
miles per gallon in the city.
   U.S. auto makers have concentrated most of their new
product development efforts on building better six- and
eight-cylinder engines, says Mr. Cedergren.
   To be sure, Detroit has some products it could throw into
the breach. GM has a multi-valve, four-cylinder engine
similar to those found on many Japanese cars. And late this
fall, the No. 1 auto maker is scheduled to launch its new
Saturn line of compact cars that are expected to match
Japanese levels of performance and fuel economy.
   Ford, meanwhile, recently unveiled the new Ford Escort, a
subcompact jointly engineered with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp.
The high-mileage Escort has had disappointing sales, but that
could change if gasoline prices continue to rise.
   Chrysler Corp. continues to offer many cars powered by
four-cylinder engines. But the company's fortunes hinge in
large part on its minivans, most of which are powered by V-6
engines and get relatively low mileage.
   Even if the Persian Gulf quiets down in the next few
weeks, Detroit may still have reason to worry. Congress isn't
likely to act in this session to boost fuel economy
standards, but the sudden focus on the country's dependence
on foreign oil could ease the way for tougher regulation.
   Says top Chrysler lobbyist Robert Liberatore: "I could see
this whole mess in the Middle East raising the hue and cry
for conservation."
