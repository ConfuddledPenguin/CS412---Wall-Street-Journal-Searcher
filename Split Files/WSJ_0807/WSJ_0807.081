   In the 1970s, Bob Guccione was the prototypical swinging
magazine publisher. Like his counterpart and rival, Playboy
publisher Hugh Hefner, Mr. Guccione lived fast and made
millions selling sexual fantasy through the pages of
Penthouse.
   Hef has largely retired to the mansion. But Mr. Guccione,
60 years old and loaded down with gold chains and medallions,
is still swinging. Though many pin-striped publishers are
closing magazines or auctioning large properties, Mr.
Guccione has become, largely by default, the most acquisitive
publisher in the business.

   As chairman of closely held General Media International
Inc., Mr. Guccione is moving beyond the skin magazines on
which he's built his fortune, snapping up special-interest
magazines for car lovers and personal-computer users --
magazines that other publishers had passed on as being too
small or in fields too competitive. In June, he acquired
Stock Car Racing and two other car magazines. In April, he
acquired Compute] from Capital Cities/ABC Inc. He has doubled
the circulation of Four Wheeler magazine since acquiring it
in 1986. And he may revive the defunct literary magazine
Saturday Review, to which he owns the rights, as a Sunday
magazine supplement to metropolitan newspapers.
   Profits from Four Wheeler, 12-year-old Omni magazine,
digest-sized Forum and a slew of Penthouse spinoffs financed
his $5 million launch in 1988 of Longevity, a health magazine
that has grown quickly in advertising and circulation.
General Media International, once known as Penthouse
International, stayed away from junk bond financing in the
1980s. It has manageable debt, Mr. Guccione says, and thus
can spend on start-ups and acquisitions with relative
freedom.
   "Guccione is in good shape," says Charles Elbaum,
president of Publishing Economics Inc., a consulting company.
"It's a smart and quiet company. They don't make a lot of
noise, but they make a lot of money."
   Indeed, Penthouse has long supported Mr. Guccione's
luxurious life style. His Manhattan town house includes a
ballroom, indoor pool, and paintings by Chagall, Degas and
Picasso. Mr. Guccione, dressed in a sweater, no shirt, and
the usual array of gold chains and rings, says: "I can't ever
forget what Penthouse has done for us. It spoiled us." Mr.
Guccione runs the company with his wife, Kathy Keeton, who is
vice chairman of General Media and heads Omni and Longevity.
   "Other publishers, they respect me," Mr. Guccione adds.
"They may not say it, but they would die to have Penthouse.
It's a cash cow. People look down their noses at the National
Enquirer, but when it was up for sale, all the major
publishers stood in line, and it sold for $412 million."
   But Mr. Guccione is also regarded as part of the seamy
underbelly of the magazine world. Several national drug and
convenience store chains continue to boycott Penthouse and
other men's magazines. There's also lingering fallout from
former Attorney General Edwin Meese's Commission on
Pornography, which scared retailers and stirred community
activists who object to Penthouse and Playboy.
   These challenges may have helped to depress Penthouse's
circulation, though the magazine, which generates about 60%
of General Media's $200 million in annual revenue, remains a
huge seller. According to Capell's Circulation Report, an
industry newsletter, Penthouse last year was the No. 7
magazine and No. 3 monthly in newsstand sales at 1.9 million
copies a month.
   The Audit Bureau of Circulations, which lists numbers
based on a six-month reporting period, puts Penthouse's total
circulation for this year's first half at 1.7 million.
Playboy expects to report circulation for the same period of
about 3.4 million, three-quarters of that from subscriptions.
With a $5 cover price, Penthouse's newsstand sales make it
the most profitable monthly magazine in the country for the
retailers who sell it.
   Penthouse sells about 63% of the total copies it puts on
newsstands and at checkouts, making it one of only 20
magazines in the country to sell over 60%. That may augur
well for the future: Publishers are expected to be hit with a
postal-rate increase of as much as 23% early next year. "If
you are a publisher heavily into subscriptions, you will get
slammed by the rate increase," says Mr. Elbaum.
   But even with that advantage, Mr. Guccione knows the glory
days of Penthouse are past. Selling 1.9 million copies a
month is "terrific by industry standards, considering
Penthouse is usually sold behind the counter" or in a rack
that obscures most of the magazine's cover, says Dan Capell,
the consultant who tracks magazine circulation. But in the
days before the Meese commission, Penthouse newsstand sales
reached 3.8 million copies in 1982.
   Many major retailers still refuse to sell the magazine.
Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience-store
owner, stripped Penthouse and Playboy from the shelves of its
4,500 company-owned 7-Eleven stores in 1986 and recommended
that its 4,000 franchised stores do the same. "The vast
majority of franchises do comply with our recommendation,"
says Cecilia Norwood, a Southland spokeswoman. Peoples Drug
Stores Inc., operator of 500 stores in the mid-Atlantic
states, also banned Penthouse in 1986, then allowed it back
on a trial basis last year until customer complaints and slow
sales prompted the chain to pull it again.
   "Its sales have never recovered, either because of lack of
exposure at the counters or because tastes have changed,"
says John Harrington, president of the Council for Periodical
Distributors Associations.
   Mr. Guccione concedes that newsstand sales are likely to
fall further in coming years. "Penthouse will continue to be
our flagship, but there will never be another magazine that
can sell four million copies a month at newsstands," he says.
   Mr. Guccione's attempts to create other men's and sexually
explicit magazines haven't worked. Viva, a sex magazine for
women, bombed because retailers displayed it next to Hustler
instead of Cosmopolitan. New Look, a general-interest
magazine that used striking, often shocking photos, including
some nudity that wasn't sexually suggestive, was launched in
1985, near the height of publicity stirred by the Meese
commission. Many stores were afraid to carry it, and it
folded after a year.
   Mr. Guccione made his first stab at special-interest
magazines in 1986 with the acquisition of Four Wheeler, a
magazine based in Canoga Park, Calif. Mr. Guccione says he
"didn't mess with the editorial product," kept the offices in
California, and improved the paper stock and design. In four
years, Four Wheeler's circulation has nearly doubled to
355,466. The three automotive titles bought in June will be
added to the Four Wheeler division and sold to advertisers as
a group.
   Compute] will be more of a gamble. The computer magazine
field is thoroughly saturated. Under Capital Cities/ABC,
circulation for Compute] was falling. Under the control of
Ms. Keeton, Compute] will be reintroduced with a new design
in October and aimed mainly at home and office
personal-computer users. Compute] will be offered to
advertisers in a package with Omni, Mr. Guccione's science
magazine.
   Mr. Guccione's longest leap from his Penthouse past is
probably his introduction of a Russian edition of Omni, which
involved speaking recently before the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. "In the U.S., they say, `How could Bob Guccione
create a science magazine? It must be a fluke,'" Mr. Guccione
says. "But the Soviets have a hunger for Western ideas. I was
treated as if I were Funk and Wagnall."
   But there was another dimension to his visit. Some
Russians took him aside and suggested that he launch a
Russian version of Penthouse, he adds. "They told me it would
be good for the Soviet man."
