   "There's a sleeping giant in this country," says Rodney
Crowell, the distinguished Nashville singer and songwriter,
"and one of these days it may wake up on the wrong side of
the bed."
   Crowell was one of the first country musicians to campaign
actively against the current movement to censor music. (He
testified in several state legislatures against bills to
impose labeling of records with offensive contents.) But even
he seems startled by the escalating crusade against
heavy-metal rockers and black rap groups.

   The well-publicized rap group 2 Live Crew continues to
cause arrests. In San Antonio, David Risher, owner of that
city's Hog Wild Record and Tape store, was arraigned recently
on a charge of promoting obscene material. Ignoring police
warnings, he had sold a copy of the group's record to the son
of a local anti-pornography crusader. Since the record "As
Nasty as They Wanna Be" was ruled obscene in May by a federal
judge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police in Texas, Florida and
Ohio have told store owners not to sell it. In Dallas an
assistant DA, a candidate for a local judgeship, has begun to
target two of the largest record chains in the state. Three
members of the group itself were busted after an "adults
only" performance in Fort Lauderdale.
   But more is involved than a vulgar and musically mediocre
group of ghetto kids. The British heavy-metal group Judas
Priest is currently spending its days in a Reno, Nev.,
courtroom. The group's members are defendants, along with CBS
records in a product-liability suit that charges their record
"Stained Class" implanted subliminal suggestions that caused
two fans to commit suicide. Even the "stickering" bills,
believed moribund after the industry adopted a voluntary
program, are making a comeback. One recently passed the
Louisiana Legislature, but was promptly vetoed by the
governor.
   It seems that Crowell's sleeping giant is beginning to
stir, prodded by opportunistic politicians, and it may lumber
along for a while, causing a great deal of damage. Elected
officials must be sensing a constituency demand to bring
these obscenity cases. Otherwise, why risk the predictable
ridicule in the national press? Furthermore, support for this
censorship isn't simply a case of middle-class parents
reacting to adolescent provocation.
   The most chilling report in the midst of the Broward
County, Fla., uproar over 2 Live Crew actually concerned a
school play at the Wilton Manors Elementary School.
   Staff at the South Florida school had written a musical
called "In Quest of the Banjo Man" to help teach geography.
Some 100 fifth-graders were set to stage the tale of a
starfish who crawls from continent to continent, encountering
a variety of cultures. That is, until parents of one student
read and reread the script, carefully annotating what they
saw as references to voodoo, paganism and devil worship. The
parents noted, for instance, that the play mentioned 33
countries in Europe, which multiplied by two is 66, one digit
short of the "Number of the Beast," 666. These parents,
supported by their pastor, took their complaint to the school
principal, who canceled the play.
   The complaints were one thing. People have been seeing
Satan under the bed for a long time. What's new is that
community leaders are taking them seriously. Several years
ago, we laughed at the activist who heard a paean to the
devil in a backward version of the theme song to "Mr. Ed,"
the television series about a talking horse. Now his group is
leading the crusade against 2 Live Crew.
   These far-out attitudes gain respectability as they move
into a void called "defense of Middle Class values." Most
people are disgusted by obscenity. If the courts and "opinion
leaders" have trouble defining it, less bashful crusaders
pick up support by default. And if there is a history of
debate on literary standards, the field is wide open when it
comes to music.
   As a musician, Crowell asks why people are picking on the
record industry when dirty books and X-rated videos sell
freely. One reason is that religious crusaders have grasped
an idea that still eludes traditional politicians, that music
is a supremely important political phenomenon.
   This idea, as old as Plato, recently gained currency in
Allan Bloom's surprise best seller, "The Closing of the
American Mind." But it was already percolating in the
evangelical debate over using rock 'n' roll as a means of
religious expression. (A leading opponent of "Christian
rock," the fallen preacher Jimmy Swaggart, is a talented
musician himself, and the cousin of rockabilly great Jerry
Lee Lewis.)
   Mr. Bloom's, and Swaggart's, argument centers on music as
an expression of a state of soul. In the classical
understanding, the city should foster the mode of music
appropriate to its regime. Although Mr. Bloom became famous
for denouncing rock 'n' roll, his point was to explain Plato.
It wouldn't be the first time that a subtle exercise in
philosophy spawned a political monster.
   Mr. Bloom's fans are attacking rap and heavy metal in a
spirit that was possibly appropriate to the homogeneous,
small-scale Greek city-state, but becomes a disaster imposed
on modern mass culture. In modern form, this spirit has
caused most of the miseries of the miserable 20th century.
   A country performer such as Rodney Crowell might be more
in tune with the tastes of Swaggart's constituency, but he
senses how dangerous it might be to inflame and mislead its
passions. The politicians who smell a soft target in the
music industry should listen to his warning.
