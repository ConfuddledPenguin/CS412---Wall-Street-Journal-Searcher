   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- American Health Services Corp.
said E. Larry Atkins was named president and chief executive
officer, succeeding S. Lewis Meyer, who resigned those
positions, as well as those of chairman and director.
   The change follows the sale earlier this year of new
preferred stock and warrants representing a 30% stake in the
operator of medical diagnostic imaging centers to OmniCorp
Holdings Inc., U.S. arm of OmniCorp A.G., a Swiss concern
that is, in turn, controlled by Swiss investor Werner Rey.

   OmniCorp acquired its stake for $7 million and assumed
three seats on American Health's seven-member board.
   A spokesman for American Health said Mr. Meyer, 46 years
old, resigned after "differences over the company's direction
as a whole between not only Omni's directors, but all the
directors led to a feeling that it was time for a change."
   Mr. Atkins, 43, has been executive vice president and
chief operating officer of American Health. The company
spokesman said the position of chairman will remain vacant
for the moment.
   American Health stock closed yesterday unchanged, at $1.50
a share, in over-the-counter trading. Announcement of the
change was made shortly before the close of trading.
