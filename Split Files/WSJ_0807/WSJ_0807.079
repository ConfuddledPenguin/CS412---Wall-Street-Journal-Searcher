   McDonald's Corp., pummeled by the stock market in recent
days, sought to soothe nervous Wall Street analysts by
promising to reduce the cost of new restaurants and using
discounting as a sales tactic.
   Some analysts came away from the conference call with
McDonald's disappointed at what they didn't hear.

   "I didn't learn anything new with respect to the
fundamental issues such as turning sales around in the U.S.,"
said Michael Mueller of Montgomery Securities Inc., San
Francisco.
   Similarly, Prudential-Bache Securities restaurant analyst
Leslie Steppel said, "There wasn't any new strategy revealed
-- just a rehashing. I didn't come away feeling that anything
was going to change."
   But McDonald's executives did say they intend to take
perhaps $100,000 out of the cost of building a new domestic
store, primarily in equipment and construction savings. The
current average cost of about $1.5 million has come under
fire lately for rising more rapidly than the sales rate.
   The company, which blamed the softening economy and
intense competition for no-growth domestic sales, reiterated
it is willing to use discounting as a tactic -- but not a
strategy -- to improve sales at the expense of margins.
   Also, executives told analysts that despite the low
current price of its stock, McDonald's is likely to reduce
its share repurchase plan. McDonald's closed yesterday at
$29.125, down $1.125 in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   In the past two weeks the price of McDonald's shares have
fallen nearly $10 a share, as its second-quarter earnings
came in below some Wall Street estimates and as nervous
investors have deserted even blue-chip issues such as
McDonald's.
   The company still plans to open more than 300 restaurants
in the U.S. this year, Ms. Steppel said. But it struck her as
a contradiction that McDonald's is relying increasingly on
franchisees domestically while putting more company-owned
stores overseas. Franchisees' profit margins typically are
lower than that of company-owned stores.
   "They indicated that the environment was competitive and
difficult and was likely to remain so for the second half,"
Mr. Mueller said. And despite intense price-cutting by some
fast-food competitors, he said that "discounting is not going
to be employed as a strategy. It's one of an arsenal of
tactics."
   Nevertheless, McDonald's told analysts and portfolio
managers it is comfortable with per-share earnings estimates
of between $2.20 and $2.25 for the year.
   As for McDonald's pizza, in test since last summer,
executives said it is at least two years away from becoming
part of the domestic menu, analysts reported. Earlier, some
had thought the product would be rolled out much sooner.
