   MNC FINANCIAL Inc., a Baltimore-based holding company for
commercial banks in the Washington-Baltimore area, said it
agreed to raise about $180 million through a private
placement of convertible preferred stock to Alfred Lerner, a
director of MNC who owns 8.9% of its common stock. Under the
agreement, other directors may subscribe to as much as 50% of
the private placement. MNC said the pact is part of the
company's efforts to strengthen its capital position. MNC's
debt has been classified as below investment grade,
reflecting a downturn in the region's economy and real estate
market. According to the agreement, the $180 million of
preferred shares will bear 12% quarterly cumulative cash
dividends. Each preferred share will be convertible into
common stock at a conversion price of $10.75 a common share.
The transaction is expected to close this fall, pending a
definitive agreement and regulatory approval.
