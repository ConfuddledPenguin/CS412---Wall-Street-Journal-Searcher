   MILWAUKEE -- Firstar Corp. said it agreed to acquire Banks
of Iowa Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $216 million.
   The acquisition, which requires approval of both banking
concerns' shareholders, would give Firstar the second-biggest
banking presence in Iowa, a state that suffered from the
mid-1980s farm crisis but has since rebounded strongly.
Firstar has assets of about $8.5 billion; Banks of Iowa, Des
Moines, has assets of about $2.5 billion.

   Earlier this year, Banks of Iowa ended a nearly decade-old
agreement to be acquired by First Bank System Inc.,
Minneapolis, saying it would seek another suitor.
   Under the agreement, Firstar would issue 2.7 common shares
for each of the approximately 2.9 million Banks of Iowa
common shares outstanding. Firstar closed yesterday at $28,
unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange; Banks of Iowa's shares closed at $68.75, up 75
cents in over-the-counter trading.
   The total price is about 1.2 times Banks of Iowa's June
30, 1990, common equity of $181 million.
   Firstar said it expects to trim data processing and
payroll expenses at the combined banking concerns and boost
Banks of Iowa's income through increased lending and other
services, so that the issuance of new shares won't be
dilutive after 1992.
   Holder meetings are expected this October. Completion of
the transaction should take place after the first of next
year, when Iowa's new interstate banking law becomes
effective.
