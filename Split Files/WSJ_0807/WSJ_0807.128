   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- A psychologist's taped sessions
with the sons of slain Live Entertainment Inc. Chairman Jose
Menendez will be admitted as evidence in the sons' murder
trial, a state court ruled here.
   The decision by Judge James Albracht, which may unveil a
key piece of evidence in the celebrated case, overrode
conventional confidentiality of doctor-patient
communications. The judge accepted prosecutors' arguments
that Lyle and Erik Menendez, accused of murdering their
parents, allegedly threatened psychologist Leon Jerome Oziel,
thereby making the tapes a proper subject for court review.

   A lawyer for Lyle Menendez said both brothers plan to
appeal the ruling.
   Judge Albracht said his written opinion in the matter
would remain sealed until Aug. 15. However, he summarized his
view that none of the remarks were privileged because the
psychologist had reason to believe that the brothers were a
threat -- a threat that should be disclosed to avoid the
danger.
   Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty, were shot Aug. 20 in
their Beverly Hills, Calif. Their sons alerted police, saying
they had discovered the bodies on their return from the
movies.
   However, the sons were charged with the murders in March,
and the tapes played a prominent role when Los Angeles County
district attorney Ira Reiner said they contained "very
important" evidence supporting allegations that the brothers
killed their parents to gain access to a $14 million estate.
