   "Louis Sullivan comes as close to being a disgrace to his
profession and his race as anybody I have seen in the
Cabinet." -- Rep. Fortney "Pete" Stark (D., Calif.)
   "I don't live on Pete Stark's plantation." -- Secretary of
Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan

   Congressman Stark apologized to Dr. Sullivan last Friday,
one day after his racialist outburst, and if this were merely
an isolated incident we'd leave it at that. But Mr. Stark has
opened a window on liberalism's Shoal Creek Country Club.
This deserves further inspection.
   In recent weeks, of course, all of America has read about
Shoal Creek, the Birmingham, Alabama, country club that says
it doesn't exclude blacks but never got around to admitting
any. This scrutiny of country-club culture is fine by us and
the controversy has been a step toward greater racial
harmony. But next on the list should be the form of
discrimination expressed by Mr. Stark: That the only good
blacks are liberal blacks. Whites can think for themselves,
but blacks (and other minorities) had better think like Pete
Stark or they're a "disgrace" to their race.
   Consider the context of Mr. Stark's attack on Dr.
Sullivan. He uttered the tirade at a routine news conference
announcing a new health-care proposal. In the midst of
attacking Dr. Sullivan's opposition to national health
insurance (a pet Stark idea) and to abortion, he slipped
easily and thoughtlessly into the racial jibe. His crack was
so unconscious and sincere it brought to mind former Los
Angeles Dodger official Al Campanis on "Nightline."
   Even after Dr. Sullivan demanded an apology on Thursday,
Mr. Stark failed to understand his slight. He replied to a
reporter: "He's right. He doesn't live on my plantation. He
lives on White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's plantation.
He is indeed a sad and pathetic figure." Only the next day,
after his attack was denounced by both the White House and
members of Congress, did Mr. Stark say he "blew it" by
bringing race into his disagreement.
   Dr. Sullivan's offense, of course, isn't conformity at
all, especially since Cabinet secretaries are supposed to
implement White House policy. His sin is independent
thinking. Dr. Sullivan has recently been giving thoughtful
speeches on health and social issues that don't comport with
the liberal stereotype of how a black public official should
act.
   Unlike many black leaders, he's bravely attacked black
nationalist Louis Farrakhan for "anti-Semitic rhetoric" that
is "shameful, outrageous and stupid." He often speaks about
building a new "culture of character" in America that would
resist the liberal response of blaming individual troubles on
society. At an NAACP dinner in April, Dr. Sullivan spoke of
the "great crisis for the black male" from drugs and crime
and stressed the importance of family and community.
   In opposing nationalized health care, he's even had the
temerity to say socialism isn't good for blacks. "I fear that
black Americans may disproportionately suffer," he told an
audience of black physicians last week. "The rich can always
afford private care, but those who rely on a scheme of
national health insurance -- the poor and disadvantaged --
will have to get in line."
   White liberals such as Pete Stark have grown accustomed to
having blacks as their intellectual caddies. Dr. Sullivan is
saying he wants to join the public-policy club as an equal,
but Mr. Stark wants to keep him carrying someone else's
views. Who's really the "disgrace?"
