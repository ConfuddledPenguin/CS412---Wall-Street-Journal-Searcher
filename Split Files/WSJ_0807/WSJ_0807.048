   PARIS -- France's index of industrial production in the
first quarter rose 1.63% from a year earlier but declined
0.8% from the 1989 fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted
basis, the National Statistics Institute said.
   The governmental statistics body attributed the decline
from the previous quarter to a 6.3% drop in energy-sector
activity.
