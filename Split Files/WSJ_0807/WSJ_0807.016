   TOKYO -- Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy
Industries Co. Ltd. are proceeding to set up sales networks
in East Germany, spokesmen for the companies said.
   Mazda is planning to establish an office in East Berlin
and to set up around 50 sales and service shops throughout
East Germany by year end. The company is scheduled to export
its first 500 passenger cars to East Germany this month, the
spokesman said.

   Mazda, which has the largest market share in West Germany
among Japanese car makers, is aiming to take the top spot in
East Germany as well, Mazda's spokesman said.
   Fuji has signed contracts with 20 local dealers to sell
its cars in East Germany and plans to increase the number.
Its West German subsidiary, Subaru Deutschland, will
administer sales in East Germany, Fuji's spokesman said.
   With the setting up of sales networks by Mazda and Fuji,
all Japanese passenger-car makers, except mini-car makers
Daihatsu Motor Co. and Suzuki Motor Co., either have started
or have decided to start sales in East Germany.
