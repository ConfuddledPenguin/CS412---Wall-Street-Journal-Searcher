   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and its allies, having gotten a
pledge from much of the world to stop buying Iraqi oil, now
are laying the groundwork for a naval blockade to enforce the
embargo.
   After the United Nations Security Council voted 13-0 to
impose a sweeping ban on trade with Iraq, a sober President
Bush declared: "These sanctions will be enforced, no matter
what it takes."

   In a brief exchange with reporters, he pointedly refused
to rule out a blockade, and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, after a White House meeting, said Britain would be
willing to consider a blockade if the embargo proves
ineffective. The U.N. charter specifically provides for
military steps, including a naval blockade, to enforce
Security Council resolutions.
   The resolution, passed to punish Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait, also gives nations such as Japan the international
political cover they were seeking before firmly committing
themselves to cut off Iraqi oil purchases.
   Under one plan being considered by the U.S. and some of
its allies, the blockade would be manned by an international
fleet under U.N. auspices. The ships would stop tankers
carrying Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil out of the Persian Gulf or from
ports in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, where pipelines carrying
Iraqi oil terminate.
   President Bush plans to dispatch Secretary of State James
Baker later this week to Turkey in an effort to gain support
for the embargo and a possible blockade. Turkish Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal yesterday strongly implied in an
interview with ABC-TV that he would be willing to cut off the
pipeline, presumably making a blockade of his port
unnecessary.
   Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein, in a two-hour meeting with
the top U.S. diplomat in Baghdad, warned the U.S. "against
any act that might endanger the region's peace and security,"
citing Iraq's "high and unlimited readiness to sacrifice,"
the Iraqi news agency said. A U.S. official characterized the
meeting as "a mixed bag" of conciliatory-sounding comments
and tough talk.
   Despite yesterday's developments, the possibility of a
naval blockade of Iraq is generating controversy and
disagreement within the Bush administration. The Joint Chiefs
of Staff are cool to the plan, according to a source close to
Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the joint chiefs. Some
military analysts said that maintaining one for a long period
of time would be logistically difficult and would leave
American ships exposed to attacks from Iraqi aircraft and
seaborne Exocet missiles.
   And some administration officials say they hope a blockade
won't be necessary, citing the broad international support so
far for a voluntary embargo.
   As plans moved forward to cut off Mr. Hussein's oil
exports, his prime source of income, some U.S. officials said
they believe that cutting off food exports to Iraq may also
prove an effective means of putting pressure on Mr. Hussein.
The U.S. and Europe provide most of Iraq's imported
foodstuffs, and they have cut off such shipments.
   Iraq's allies don't produce enough food for their own
people, so should such a food embargo hold up, U.S. estimates
indicate that Iraqi citizens could begin experiencing
shortages of basic food commodities, such as bread and rice,
as early as October. "It looks like October-November would be
a difficult time; there will start being some pressures,"
said John Parker, an analyst for the U.S. Agriculture
Department. And judging from their apparent lack of
preparation for a possible cut-off of imports, he added, "I
don't think they realized how dependent they were."
   U.S. officials also continue to see the possibility that
Iraq will move beyond Kuwait to invade oil-rich Saudi Arabia,
which would likely result in an all-out war involving
American forces.
   American officials said Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait had
consolidated their positions close to the Saudi border,
moving in equipment that would be needed to support an
invasion, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater flatly
declared that Iraq now poses a "threat" to Saudi Arabia.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney yesterday held hastily
scheduled talks with officials in Saudi Arabia seeking the
right to send U.S. planes to the kingdom. Iraqi forces herded
hundreds of foreign nationals, including 28 Americans, out of
their hotels in Kuwait and onto buses for an unknown
destination, raising the specter that he may be accumulating
potential hostages.
   Although it ships some of its oil from its own port
through the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian
Gulf, Iraq normally exports most of its approximately 2.8
million barrels of oil each day through the pipelines that
pass through Saudi Arabia and Turkey. While the U.S. would
like both those countries to simply shut the pipelines down,
both countries have reasons not to do so.
   Turkey gets half of its own oil from the pipeline. Saudi
Arabia, meanwhile, has a non-aggression pact and an agreement
with Iraq that would make it an act of war to cut the
pipeline. The Saudis are convinced that such a step would
give Mr. Hussein a strong pretext for either invading or for
attacking their oil fields.
   Thus, assuming the pipelines remain open, a blockade would
probably have to include the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbu and
the Turkish Gulf of Iskenderun in the eastern Mediterranean.
Such an offshore naval blockade would let the two countries
tell Iraq that the matter is out of their control.
   Within the Bush administration, some officials are arguing
for a blockade on the grounds that the naval forces needed to
carry it out are already moving into place, and that it would
probably work without actual use of force. Few tanker
captains, these officials say, would dare run a blockade of
warships far more substantial than the small boats Iran used
in its so-called tanker war in the Persian Gulf in 1987.
   The U.S. has one carrier task force of 13 ships on station
near the Gulf of Oman at the mouth of the Persian Gulf and
another eight ships operating inside the Gulf, soon to be
joined by two British frigates and one French. A second task
force of 13 ships is positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean,
led by the carrier Eisenhower.
   A third task force of 10 ships headed by the carrier
Saratoga and the battleship Wisconsin, which has been
converted into a cruise-missile carrier, is heading for the
Mediterranean from East Coast seaports today, and includes a
Marine landing force. Pentagon spokesmen say its deployment
is a normal replacement for the Eisenhower group. In previous
crises in the Gulf, though, the U.S. has doubled up its naval
units, holding ships beyond their normal rotation.
   There were also reports yesterday that the U.S. was moving
B-52 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and to Oman,
putting them within striking range of Iraq. A Pentagon
spokesman refused to confirm or deny the reports.
   On his trip to Turkey later this week, Secretary Baker
will be carrying intelligence information designed to prove
that Iraq is prepared to move further against its Arab
neighbors. And he will pledge to Turkish leaders that, if
they aid the U.S.-led oil cutoff, the U.S. will stand by them
against any Iraqi retaliation.
   Under one scenario being considered, any tankers carrying
Iraqi oil out of the blockaded areas would be stopped by the
multinational force and impounded; the oil would be auctioned
off and the money held in a kind of escrow account. Such an
action, if it were carried out, is believed to be sufficient
to effectively shut down further Iraqi exports.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, the U.S. and Western allies
cooperated in the escorting of Kuwaiti tankers through the
Persian Gulf, and the experience "would be very helpful" in a
blockade now, says Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon official
who now heads the Center for Security Policy, a defense think
tank. "We have considerable experience doing multilateral
escorting."
   Yet other analysts point out difficulties and risks --
problems that give rise to the reluctance of American
military officials to undertake a blockade. "It's a lot
easier on paper than in the real world," says a senior
Pentagon official. The Joint Chiefs haven't ruled out the
idea, he says, "but it's clearly not among our highest
priorities."
   Ships forming a blockade would have to be prepared to use
force on tankers, and even fire on them if necessary. That
could push into a political clash with the countries whose
flags the tankers are flying.
   Another problem would be distinguishing between tankers
carrying Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil and those with oil from other
countries -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
Iran, for example, which make use of the same waterways.
Moreover, the Saudis ship their oil through parts of the same
pipeline system the Iraqis use.
   Iraq's Mr. Hussein, sensing that a blockade was being
carried out with the tacit cooperation of Saudi Arabia and
Turkey, might choose to retaliate against those countries.
Though Iraq has a weak navy, it has modern aircraft and
missiles that could seriously threaten Saudi oil
installations. (On the other hand, U.S. analysts say almost
all of Iraq's oil installations are now at risk from U.S.
carrier-based aircraft, which are believed to be within range
and carry laser-guided bombs that could inflict a great deal
of damage.)
   Other analysts worry that the nations engaged in a
blockade could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks from Iraq
or its sympathizers.
   A central player in U.S. military planning in the days
ahead will be Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander in chief
of the U.S. Central Command, who was part of the team that
accompanied Defense Secretary Cheney to Saudi Arabia. While
the team's primary mission reportedly was to seek approval
for U.S. use of Saudi airfields and military bases, the
officials were also to explore the blockade issue with Saudi
leaders.
   Gen. Schwarzkopf, 55, would become the overall commander
if Army and Air Forces were sent to join the U.S. naval
forces operating in the Persian Gulf area. A former top
planner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Schwarzkopf is
considered an expert on the 10 years of planning that the
U.S. has developed for war scenarios in that volatile region.
   Those plans, which started during the Carter years under
the auspices of the Rapid Deployment Force, now focus on the
Central Command, a separate headquarters structure normally
based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Generally
comprising fewer than 700 people, it could grow to over
300,000 men and women in a crisis, depending on the military
options selected by the president.
   At least some analysts believe it will take more than a
naval blockade to gain the attention of Iraq's dictator.
"What he really responds to is brute force," says Kenneth
Katzman, a defense consultant who until last summer worked at
the Central Intelligence Agency on secret profiles of foreign
leaders, including Saddam Hussein. "Economic sanctions are
long-term, and it's hard for him to grasp their effects."
   Mr. Katzman says "the best thing we can do is bomb his
airfields," which he thinks would cause Mr. Hussein "to fold
up quickly. . . . Right now he's feeling invincible, flush
with victory."
   Yet other U.S. analysts see real economic vulnerability
within Iraq, particularly in Mr. Hussein's ability to feed
his people in the months ahead.
   Iraq imports about 70% of the roughly five million tons of
wheat it consumes a year. At the last count by the U.S., as
of June 30, the Iraqis had only a two months' supply of wheat
in stock. Rice is also in short supply.
   The Iraqi poultry industry, a model of efficiency in the
Middle East, is especially imperiled by the boycott. The
chicken-producing industry uses about 850,000 tons of corn a
year, most of which comes from the U.S. But U.S. estimates
for this month show that Iraq has a backlog of only 22,000
tons.
   "Their poultry industry will run into trouble real soon,"
says Mr. Parker, the agriculture department analyst. "That's
been the leading success story of their agricultural
production."
   Shortages also are likely in other staple food products.
Iraq imports about 90% of its cheese, much of it from Europe.
Most of its meat, sugar and cooking oil also comes from
abroad.
