   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. and the Communications
Workers of America struggled to fashion a thre-eyear contract
to replace one scheduled to expire last midnight, covering
about 2,500 employees.
   The CWA said it would strike if a contract wasn't signed
by the deadline.

   Negotiators for the company and the International
Telegraph Workers/CWA, a unit of the parent international,
have been haggling for the past week over Western Union's
demand that employees pick up more of the company's annual
health-care costs.
   Western Union is seeking relaxation of past agreements
with the union that pertain to the hiring of outside workers.
And the company wants the union to let it increase the number
of part-time workers it can hire in its central telephone
bureaus.
   "This company will not shut down," said a Western Union
spokesman, adding that temporary workers hired and trained by
the company will take over for any strikers.
   Most of the employees involved are in telephone bureaus in
Reno, Nev., and Bridgeton, Mo., and computer and
order-processing facilities in Bridgeton, Middletown, Va.,
Dallas and Atlanta.
