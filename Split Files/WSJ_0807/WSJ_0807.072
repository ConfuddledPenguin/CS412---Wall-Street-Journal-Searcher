   MOSCOW -- Siemens AG thought it had a sweet deal when
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, visiting Bonn in June
1989, signed up the Soviet Union to buy 300,000 personal
computers. But more than a year later, the West German
electronics giant is still waiting to flood the
computer-hungry Soviet market. The purchase is hung up
because the Soviets don't have the hard currency to pay the
bill, company officials say.
   Siemens is one of many Western computer companies
discovering that in today's Soviet Union, it's easier to find
predictions of an explosion of pent-up personal-computer
demand than actual customers. At a recent computer show in
the Soviet capital, most of the 85 U.S., Asian and European
company exhibitors found themselves hobbled by small Soviet
budgets, rampant software piracy and a general lack of
knowledge among managers about Western computers.

   Perhaps the biggest problem is that the Soviet ruble can't
be converted into hard currencies. Under Mr. Gorbachev's
economic reforms, many Soviet enterprises are now able to
spend hard currency they earn from exports. But, show
participants said, persuading managers to buy computers can
be tough. To get around the problem, some suppliers are
turning to elaborate barter deals, selling computers for
rubles and then buying Soviet products for export. While
business is being done, most sellers have scaled back their
expectations. Soviet demand for Western software and
hardware, they say, is likely to be modest for the
foreseeable future.
   "How can the market explode when we have a shortage of
hard currency?" asks Tatyana Fedorenko, a marketing
representative for International Business Machines Corp. in
Moscow. Says Alexander Berest, who works for a Soviet-U.S.
joint venture called Dialog that markets Microsoft products
here: "The market isn't as wide as we would like, but there
is a basis for business."
   Some have been quick to exploit what opportunities there
are. South Korea's Hyundai, which opened an office in Moscow
in June, sold 1,000 computers in its first month to Soviet
organizations -- for dollars. "It's crazy to sell computers
for rubles," says Hyundai manager Yon Hak Choi. Hyundai's
booth at the show was mobbed by hundreds of Soviets eager to
get free handouts of glossy shopping bags and pens.
   Soviet government experts say the nation needs to buy at
least one million computers this year alone. But for Soviet
purchasing managers with little hard currency, need isn't
enough.
   Stepan Pachikov, who founded a U.S.-Soviet joint venture
named Paragraph, says the cost of a computer equals a senior
researcher's salary for five years. "No one has any economic
incentive to replace manual labor with computers," he says.
   Moreover, given the current shortages of many basic goods
in the Soviet Union, workers at enterprises want management
to spend the precious dollars they earn on Western consumer
goods, rather than on computers. "It's going to defer
productivity as long as there's a Gucci shortage," says
Alexander Randall, president of the Boston Computer Exchange.
   Mr. Randall is hoping to supply computers for a stock
exchange that city authorities in Leningrad are planning. One
way he hopes to get around the hard-currency problem is by
purchasing Russian honey with the ruble revenues and then
finding a U.S. company to take it off his hands.
   A used-computer broker, he thinks one low-cost solution
for the Soviet Union would be to buy second-hand computers.
Such plans run up against the pride of Soviet officials, who
say they want state-of-the-art equipment. But Mr. Randall has
a ready answer, thanks to his translator, who suggested he
refer to second-hand computers as "modernized."
   There are other ways out of the hard-currency bind.
Televideo Systems of San Jose, Calif., is looking at two
possible joint ventures to build offices in Moscow with ruble
sales receipts. Tandon Corp. makes its machines in Bombay and
manages to sell them to Russians for surplus rupees on the
Soviet trading account with India.
   Other Westerners hope to spend their rubles on Soviet
software, selling it abroad for hard currency. Patrick
McGovern, chairman of International Data Group, which
sponsored the show, says "in the Soviet Union, the most
exportable commodity is the software that can be created by
their very well-educated technical people." The hit video
game Tetris, for example, is the brainchild of Soviet
programmers.
   Many Soviet programmers are looking to sell abroad because
there is almost no market for software in the Soviet Union.
Boris Antoniuk of the Soviet State Committee on Science and
Technology estimates that of the 350,000 personal computers
on Soviet desks, at most 1% are running legally obtained
software. Piracy is company policy in many cases.
   "Our Western partners must understand one thing: if the
choice is between buying hardware and buying software, a
Soviet buyer with 50,000 rubles worth of hard currency to
spend won't spend half that on software," he warns.
