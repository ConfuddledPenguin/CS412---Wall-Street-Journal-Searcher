   DALLAS -- Rexene Corp. said its board authorized the maker
of plastics products to use cash on hand to purchase its
Series A senior guaranteed increasing-rate notes, due 1992,
of which about $264 million remain outstanding after previous
buy-backs.
   In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the company
said it had available cash of about $80 million. Rexene also
said it is continuing to evaluate alternatives for
refinancing the Series A notes.
