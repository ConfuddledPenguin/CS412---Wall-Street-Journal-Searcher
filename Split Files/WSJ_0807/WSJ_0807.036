   DENVER -- Amdura Corp. said it reached a definitive
agreement to sell a unit, Amdura National Distribution Co.,
to Our Own Hardware, a privately held hardware cooperative
based in Minneapolis.
   The all-cash transaction is subject to various closing
conditions and the approval of the U.S. bankruptcy judge
overseeing Amdura's reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Amdura and Amdura National filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 on April 2.
