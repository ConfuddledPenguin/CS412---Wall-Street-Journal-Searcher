   NEW YORK -- The bond market was clobbered as rapidly
rising oil prices fanned inflation fears and prompted market
players to dump some long-term securities.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which had fallen more
than three points by mid-day, ended 2 5/8 points lower. That
was the largest one-day sell-off in three years. The decline
translates into a loss of $26.25 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount.

   The yield on the long bond jumped about 1/4 percentage
point to 8.80% from 8.56%, the biggest one-day rise since
June 1987.
   Such a sharp deterioration in the bond market "tells you
that people are panicking," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez,
president of Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., a unit
of John Hancock Financial Services. "Investors are very
skittish about the outlook for inflation as well as monetary
and fiscal trends around the world." Holders of long-term
bonds view inflation as negative because it cuts the value of
portfolios.
   Inflation anxiety stems largely from political turmoil in
the Persian Gulf, which is expected to result in less
plentiful and more expensive oil supplies. That, in turn,
could lead to spiraling wages and prices in the U.S.
   Sinking Treasury prices dragged down most other sectors of
the bond market, including corporates, municipals and
mortgage-backed bonds.
   Only Treasury bills were spared during yesterday's rout,
the result of more "flight-to-quality" purchases made by
investors rushing to get cash out of the Middle East into the
U.S., which is considered a safe haven. Many arbitragers and
investors also bought bills, along with shortterm notes, in a
bet that the Federal Reserve will soon reduce the federal
funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans,
from 8%, which would boost the value of short-term
securities.
   Disappointment that the Fed didn't ease yesterday caused
some short-term securities to fall modestly, although not
nearly as much as long-term Treasurys. Prices of two-year
notes ended just 1/8 point lower, while the yield rose to
7.86% from 7.79%.
   John Costas, co-manager of trading at First Boston Corp.,
said investors were buying everything from three-month bills
to five-year notes. But, he said, "there was good selling in
anything seven years and longer."
   The Treasury's benchmark long-term bond began to decline
during overnight trading in Japan, and that spilled over to
the London session. Many of the sellers were U.S. investors,
who woke up in the middle of the night and rushed to
establish short positions. In a short sale, speculators and
professional traders sell borrowed securities and hope to
profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities. Trading U.S. bonds overseas is possible because
U.S. Treasurys are traded world-wide around the clock.
   "When London opened, we carried the overflow from Tokyo
for about one hour. At that time, we were very busy," said
Philip Harding, manager of trading in the London office of
Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc. But soon afterward, activity
quieted down and "we just settled in and waited for New York
to open," said Mr. Harding.
   U.S. trading turned out to be extremely volatile.
Long-term prices opened at levels set in Tokyo but quickly
slid into a free fall as when-issued trading began on the
$32.25 billion of securities the Treasury is scheduled to
auction today, tomorrow and Thursday.
   The when-issued trading was an eyeopener, analysts said,
because it revealed the depth of the investment community's
fear of buying fixed-income securities. They also discovered
that foreign investors, who normally buy large amounts of
U.S. Treasurys at the big quarterly auction, are shunning the
securities.
   "With Japanese bonds trading roughly at yields of 8%,
German bonds at 9% and French bonds at 10%, international
investors believe there is no incentive for them to buy U.S.
bonds," said William Brachfeld, manager of trading at Daiwa
Securities America Inc.
   Meanwhile, the lack of retail interest in the Treasury
auctions forced dealers to mark down prices in an effort to
clear out current inventory of 10-year and 30-year bonds,
putting further pressure on prices.
   The spiral downward grew steeper as the futures market
crumbled and the September bond contract touched its
threepoint lower limit. The contract rose later and ended
just 2 21/32 lower, and officials at the Chicago Board of
Trade estimated that 700,000 bond contracts were trading, the
heaviest volume since June 1989.
   As prices of the benchmark bond sank to 3 1/4 points
lower, bargain hunters finally materialized and helped to
pull prices off the bottom.
   Robert Dow, a partner and portfolio manager at Lord,
Abbett &amp; Co., which manages mutual funds, was among
yesterday's bottom-fishers. "These are very attractive
yields," he said. Unlike traders, who try to book quick
profits on daily moves in the market, Mr. Dow said he's
investing for the long term. "I don't have to worry about
where things will be in the next day or two. I'm looking at
the market over the next six to 12 months, and by that time I
think interest rates will be lower," and bond prices will be
higher, he said.
   Still, traders said sellers far outnumbered buyers
yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk-bond prices sank as tumbling stock prices combined
with rising interest rates continued to cloud the horizon for
the high-yield, high-risk securities.
   Prices of most junk bonds, which began falling as stock
prices started to plummet, ended between 1 and 1 1/2 points
lower.
   Some high-yield bonds, including widely held securities of
RJR Nabisco Inc., posted even bigger losses. RJR Nabisco's 17
3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures finished near its
lows of the day at 108 1/2, down three points. Pay-in-kind
bonds pay interest in the form of additional securities.
   RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures managed to
stage a partial rebound, ending down 1 1/4 points at 88 3/4
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   David Briggs, a senior trader at Pittsburgh-based
Federated Investors Inc., said he tried to sell junk bonds
Monday but found that the level at which he was able to trade
was often much lower than the quoted market. "Sometimes you
have to shave 1/2 point off the price just to get the trade
done," he said.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, prices of
high-grade corporate issues plunged in sympathy with steep
declines in the U.S. Treasury market. Intermediate-term
corporate bonds finished the day 1/2 point lower while
long-term corporate bonds flagged losses of between 1 1/2 and
1 3/4 points.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The sell-off in the U.S. bond market along with growing
tensions in the Middle East reverberated around the world
yesterday, leaving most major international bond markets
reeling.
   "This was one of the biggest sell-offs in international
bond markets since 1987," when a breakdown in the Louvre
Accords resulted in a global bond-market rout, said Nicholas
Sargen, a director of bond-market research at Salomon
Brothers Inc. The Louvre Accord sessions were held by major
industrial nations in an effort to seek ways to stabilize the
sinking dollar.
   Although political tensions in the Middle East began last
week, Mr. Sargen said that international investors assumed
the problems would be temporary and therefore didn't panic.
But now that it appears that tensions could escalate,
investors are worrying that "this could be the beginning of
the third oil shock."
   Hardest hit yesterday was the British market, where prices
slid nearly two points in light trading. The 11.75% bond due
2003/2007 closed at 99 3/32, down 1 31/ 32 from late Friday
to yield 11.87%.
   In Japan trading activity was hectic and extremely
volatile. At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the price of the benchmark No. 119 4.8% bond was
quoted at 83.60, down 1.13 points. The issue's yield, which
rose as high as 8.04%, ended at about 7.96%. That's up 0.26
percentage point from Friday. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield on the No. 119 closed
at about 7.33%, according to Salomon Brothers.)
   Elsewhere: French Treasurys were off 1 1/2 points in
hectic trading while prices of West German government bonds
ended nearly one point lower.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Long-term Treasurys posted sharp declines yesterday. The
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 99
10/32, down from 101 30/32 on Friday.
   Shorter-term Treasurys, however, suffered just modest
declines. The latest twoyear notes ended at 100 7/32, down
from 100 11/32.
   Bond dealers began when-issued trading yesterday for the
$32.25 billion of securities scheduled to be auctioned this
week in the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding of the
federal debt.
   The Treasury will sell $11.5 billion of three-year notes
today, $10.5 billion of tenyear note tomorrow and $10.25
billion of 30-year bond on Thursday.
   In when-issued trading, yields were quoted at 8.06% for
the three-year notes, 8.70% for the ten-year notes and 8.81%
for the 30-year bond.
   Yesterday, the Treasury sold $18.4 billion of Treasury
bills at its regular weekly auction. The average discount
rate on the three-month bills was 7.23% while the average
rate on the six-month bills was 7.19%. Those rates are down
sharply from last week's auction when they were set at 7.50%
and 7.37%, respectively.
   The rate on three-month bills was the lowest since the
average of 7.17% at the auction on Sept. 19, 1988 and matches
the auctions on Sept. 26, 1988, and Oct. 3, 1988. The rate on
six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.15% at
the auction on Aug. 1, 1988.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Aug. 9. The 13-week bills mature
Nov. 8, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 7, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Most actively traded municipal bonds closed 1 1/4 to 1 1/2
points lower, taking their cue from the Treasury market and
reacting to skyrocketing oil prices.
   The "only hope" for municipals is that some support will
come from the market's shortage of bonds and expectations for
higher taxes in a number of states, said one trader.
   Among the actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 ended 1 1/4 lower at 97 7/8,
causing the yield to shoot up to 7.36% from 7.26% late
Friday.
   In the new-issue sector, the market's bearish mood caused
a less-than-warm reception for an issue by Maricopa County,
Ariz., of $75 million of general-obligation bonds.
   The bonds, won by a Marine Midland Capital Markets Corp.
group, were priced for reoffering to yield from 6.65% in 1999
to 6.90% in 2003.
   There was an unsold balance of approximately $60 million
in late trading.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended sharply lower, following the
path of Treasury issues.
   Among actively traded issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9% issues were down 1 21/32 at 96 9/32, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 1 9/32 at 98
12/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9% issues
were down 1 17/32 at 96 11/32.
   In new-issue activity, a $150 million offering of Western
Financial auto-loan backed certificates was priced by
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   The certificates, backed by California loans on new and
used autos, carry an 8.35% coupon, and were priced at 99.896
to yield 8.51%.
