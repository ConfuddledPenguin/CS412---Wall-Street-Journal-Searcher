   SAN FRANCISCO -- Along fashionable Maiden Lane here, just
steps from Union Square, an awning hailing "Chiat/Day/Mojo"
still hangs alongside others for trendy boutiques like Chanel
and Laura Ashley.
   In advertising circles, everybody knows Jay Chiat, the
famed ad man whose Venice, Calif.-based ad shop turned out
the pink bunny campaign for Energizer batteries and the wacky
U.B.U. campaign for Reebok.

   But does anybody know Fred Goldberg?
   Mr. Goldberg headed Chiat's office here, and two months
ago led a group of senior employees that bought the office
from Chiat. The newly independent ad agency's name, which
will replace the Chiat name on the awning tomorrow, though,
has a decidedly less-sexy ring: Goldberg Moser O'Neill.
   Cut free from the Chiat/Day name, Goldberg Moser now faces
the formidable task of building its own reputation and client
list, a lone agency struggling for attention just like
hundreds of other small to mid-sized agencies. Without the
golden Chiat connection, that task will no doubt be harder.
   To be sure, the Chiat name itself has been badly tarnished
recently. Following client losses, primarily at its New York
office, the agency last week laid off about 40 staffers and
imposed pay cuts on senior managers. Yet even hobbled, the
Chiat name still has more panache than an unknown moniker
like Goldberg Moser. It's still regarded as one of the
country's top creative shops.
   Minus that cachet, Goldberg Moser faces an uncertain
future, particularly when it comes to landing new accounts.
   Mr. Goldberg and his co-creative directors, Mike Moser and
Brian O'Neill, profess not to be worried. In fact, in a
recent interview at their offices, the executives appeared
relieved to be rid of the Chiat bureaucracy and said they are
eager to start anew.
   "Nobody {in Chiat's upper management} liked the San
Francisco market or the office, and yet we did great work and
we made money," Mr. Goldberg contends -- noting that the
office did a big chunk of Chiat's most revered work,
including the early ads for Apple Computer and the recent
"bungee jumping" spot for Reebok. "That was a frustration to
my people and my morale."
   Chiat says it agreed to sell the office to Mr. Goldberg in
large part because of a conflict in new-business strategies:
While Chiat has made no secret of its hunt for $50
million-plus international clients, the San Francisco office
has continued its search for smaller, regional clients. The
result, Mr. Goldberg says, is "many lost opportunities" in
which he had been told not to chase certain clients because
they might conflict with potential deeper-pocket clients for
the New York or Los Angeles offices.
   "I'm in areas that I was never allowed to go in before,"
Mr. Goldberg says. "I've got 10 new business things cooking
right now and I think I'm going to hit a few."
   Mr. Goldberg says the parent company's bottom-line
troubles weren't a factor in his decision to cut loose from
Chiat. "I wish I could say I was that bright," he says.
   Still, Chiat's problems and client losses have indirectly
affected Goldberg Moser. The shop's billings have already
fallen to about $90 million from more than $125 million
because of account losses; it had serviced part of the $40
million Reebok account, which fired Chiat, and had to give up
clients affiliated with Chiat's Australian Mojo agency,
including Koala Springs and the Australian Tourist
Commission. About 15 of just over 100 staffers have left on
their own or been laid off since the ownership switch,
including several who walked out because they didn't want to
be associated with a non-Chiat shop.
   And billings will fall further with the loss of the G.
Heileman Brewing account, including its Rainier and Lone Star
brands. The brewer earlier this year invited its many
agencies to pitch for its combined beer business. Chiat,
before clinching the deal to sell the San Francisco office,
decided not to participate. After its management buy-out,
Goldberg Moser scrambled to get back in the running. But it
was four weeks behind and walked away a loser.
   "We were really at a disadvantage," Mr. Goldberg says. "We
don't have offices all over the place." Heileman picked Della
Femina McNamee to service its account.
   Other accounts look brighter. Longtime client Esprit de
Corp., for which Goldberg Moser previously did just media
buying and planning, has asked the shop to work on a creative
project. Qantas's North American business, which Chiat said
it planned to move to Venice, will stay at Goldberg Moser.
And the shop has picked up one new client under its new name:
the $5 million Wings learning system account from Intelligy
Corp.
   The three partners think they have the talent and an
impressive reel of commercials that will help them bring in
more of their own business. "We still revere a lot of the
principles we adhered to at Chiat/Day," says Mr. O'Neill.
"But we are very conscious that we have a separate identity."
   Mr. O'Neill, who just returned to the office after a stint
at a Chicago agency, and Mr. Moser are now busy working up
ideas on how to sell that identity. A mailing went out to new
clients explaining the changes. Other efforts are in the
works to get the new name out in front of potential clients.
   "Every great agency has mentors, and we had ours," says
Mr. Moser, who is uncharacteristically clean-cut for a
creative executive, referring to Mr. Chiat and Lee Clow, the
funky, sandals-clad top creative executive in Venice. "But we
have our own personality. We're a true San Francisco agency
-- and it's just us."
