   Tandy Corp. introduced a six-pound portable computer,
equipped with hard-disk and floppy-disk drives and priced at
$1,999, the first in what could become a deluge of "notebook"
computers.
   The Tandy 1500HD is lighter and more powerful than the
1100FD model, introduced in September by the Fort Worth,
Tex.-based electronics retailer. Since then, the market for
notebook computers, slim enough to slip into a briefcase but
powerful enough to run popular business software, has become
crowded and competitive.

   The Tandy 1500HD raises the competitive stakes, analysts
believe. "It's a pretty aggressive price," said Liz Buyer, a
vice president of Needham &amp; Co.
   The computer comes equipped with a 20-megabyte hard-disk
drive and a 1.44 megabyte floppy drive. It uses a NEC V-20
microprocessor, a faster version of the Intel 8086 chip.
   Tandy said the computer will be available in Radio Shack
stores in September.
