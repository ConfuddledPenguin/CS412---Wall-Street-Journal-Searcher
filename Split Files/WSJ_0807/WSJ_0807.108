   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and the threat it continues to
pose as military and economic retaliation is weighed, is
forcing companies to come to terms with a future in which oil
prices may be higher, supplies more scarce and the world
economy weakened.
   Responses range from higher ticket prices imposed by Pan
Am and Northwest and considered by other airlines, fuel
surcharges tacked on by freight haulers and the likelihood of
higher utility bills as the cold months approach. The
following is a sampling of how companies are being affected,
how they are coping and what they think the future holds:

   AIRLINES
                                                                                                       

   Pan Am Corp. said it plans to raise domestic and
international fares by 10% starting this week as a result of
surging jet fuel costs prompted by the invasion. The New
York-based airline holding company said that it plans to
increase domestic fares Aug. 9 and international fares Aug.
15. A spokesman said that the average price the airline pays
for fuel has increased 13% to 69 cents a gallon from 61 cents
a gallon in recent days.
   Pan Am's move follows a similar proposal by NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines unit. Last Friday, Northwest proposed
raising domestic fares $8 each way to offset rising jet-fuel
prices.
   American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., said company
officials were meeting most of the day yesterday to discuss,
among other things, alternatives in light of rising fuel
costs. A spokesman said an increase in the costs of jet fuel
of one cent a gallon increases the company's costs by about
$2 million a month.
   Glenda Hatchett Johnson, a spokeswoman for Delta Air
Lines, said the company has decided a fuel surcharge would be
premature. But she admits surcharges are under consideration.
"For every one cent {a gallon rise} in fuel costs, that
translates into an additional $20 million annually for
Delta," she said.
                                                                                                       

   UTILITIES
                                                                                                       

   A spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison Co., New York City's
electric and gas utility, said the price of low-sulfur
residual oil that Con Ed burns in its nine main power
stations already has increased in price to $23 a barrel, up
from $18 a barrel at the beginning of last week. Consumer
price increases are certain to follow, although the utility
will ratchet up consumers' energy bills slowly. Con Ed has
reserves of about three million barrels purchased at lower
prices, and is temporarily insulated from effects of the
soaring oil prices because it burns a lot of natural gas
during the summer months, when gas is relatively plentiful
and cheap. The utility is also planning to use more nuclear
energy in coming months.
   At Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the nation's largest
investor-owned utility, events are being monitored, but no
special actions are being taken, said Jackalyne Pfannenstiel,
vice president of corporate planning.
   General Public Utilities, Parsippany, N.J., which relies
mostly on coal and nuclear sources for its energy production,
said it is in a "reasonable position" to weather the crisis.
But GPU chairman Standley Hoch said that, in the long term,
an oil-related recession may spur the company to trim capital
expenditures. Mr. Hoch said barely 6% of GPU's energy mix
comes from gas and oil.
   Philadelphia Electric Co. said it hardly will be affected
by the Iraq-Kuwait conflict because the utility depends on
oil to generate less than 5% of its electricity. Instead, the
company depends on nuclear power plants for about
three-fourths of its energy needs. A spokesman noted that the
utility was hit very hard by the Arab oil embargo in the
early 70s. "Let's just say it's a lesson you should only have
to learn once," he said.
   John Rowe, chief executive officer of New England Electric
System, Westborough, Mass., says the utility will react to
the Iraq-Kuwait situation by emphasizing conservation
programs that it helps customers set up. He says the company
already spends $65 million a year on such efforts, and has
scaled way back on its use of oil -- from more than 50% a
decade ago to less than half of that now. Mr. Rowe adds that
the oil problem "puts additional pressure on the already weak
New England economy."
                                                                                                       

   OIL AND RELATED FIRMS

   Sun Co., a major gasoline refiner and retailer, said it
discontinued sales of gasoline and distillates to
non-contract customers in the Midwest served by its Toledo,
Ohio, and Tulsa, Okla., refineries. The action was taken last
Thursday to avoid any disruption of supplies to contract
customers in the event of panic buying on the spot market,
said spokesman Dennis Byrne. The company isn't imposing
volume restrictions on its three other refineries in
Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. The Radnor, Pa., company said
it doesn't anticipate shortages because only 4% of its crude
oil comes from Iraq.
   USX Corp. is busy trying to find crude oil for its
Marathon Oil unit. "Everyone is scrambling to get as many
barrels as they can so they don't run out," a spokesman for
the company said. Although the steel and energy giant is
monitoring the situation closely, no other extraordinary
measures have been taken regarding capital spending or
budgeting programs.
   Unocal Corp., the Los Angeles-based petroleum concern,
"isn't experiencing, nor do we expect to experience any
immediate problem from a supply point," said a spokesman.
   Similarly, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., the
largest oil and gas marketer in the West, isn't planning any
extraordinary steps. Arco is largely dependent on Alaskan
crude oil.
   British Petroleum Co., Britain's biggest corporation and
the world's third-biggest oil company, currently doesn't
obtain any crude oil from Iraq or Kuwait. Three-quarters of
BP's crude oil comes from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North
Sea, the rest mostly from Abu Dhabi. "The embargo isn't
really going to have much effect on us," a spokesman said.
   Quaker State Corp. said it has no contingency plans, since
most of the crude oil it uses comes from the Appalachian
base. It does, however, expect the price it pays for the
domestic crude to increase with the foreign oil prices,
leading to an increase in the prices it charges on its fuel
oil and other products.
   David A. Harpole, spokesman for Lyondell Petrochemical
Co., said his company's Houston refinery processes about
60,000 barrels of oil daily from Iraq or Kuwait. That
represents almost 21% of the refinery's volume. Thursday,
Lyondell briefly reduced its capacity by 40,000 or 50,000
barrels when President Bush issued an executive order to
freeze shipments. The 525,000 barrels which arrived on an
Iraqi ship were released later Thursday. "We had our supply
and trade people quite busy rounding up additional supplies
of crude on the spot market to replace what was restricted by
the president's executive order," Mr. Harpole said.
   J.K. Riemersma, a vice president of Denver-based Hamilton
Oil Co., said, "It's a hell of a note when you're prospering
because of war." But Mr. Riemersma says the new-found
prosperity isn't prompting any budget expansions: "In this
business, the price can go down as fast as it came up."
                                                                                                       

   CHEMICALS
                                                                                                       

   An official at a major chemicals company, who spoke on
condition the company was not identified, said it was
checking ordering patterns to see whether customers had yet
started to build up their inventories. Noting that some
chemical plants are already operating near capacity, he said
some companies may have to come up with allocation plans to
ensure "equitable distribution of product" if a buying frenzy
developed.
   Other companies that rely on oil-based feedstocks were
more sanguine. A spokesman for Cabot Corp., an energy and
specialty chemicals concern in Waltham, Mass., said the
company is closely following the Mideast situation but not
yet forming plans based on it.
   "There is no particular panic," said John Edgar, a
spokesman for Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, Britain's
biggest manufacturer and the world's fourth-biggest chemical
company. ICI is watching the price of oil and the potential
impact of the crisis on world economic growth. But the
company hasn't pushed forward its annual fall budget review,
Mr. Edgar said.
                                                                                                       

   TRANSPORTATION
                                                                                                       

   Miami-based Ryder System Inc., the giant transportation
and business-services concern, topped off its fuel-storage
tanks nationwide after the invasion. David R. Parker,
president of the vehicle leasing and services division of
Ryder, which buys some 45 million gallons of diesel fuel a
month, also said the company has contacted all its major
suppliers over the past few days to make sure its supply
agreements are in place. Mr. Parker said the company has had
contingency plans in place for several years in the event of
an oil crisis.
   Federal Express Corp. says that it has rerouted its
Europe-to-Dubai flight so that it doesn't cross Iraqi
airspace. In addition, all of its packages that were bound
for Kuwait and Iraq via third-party carriers are being held
at its Mideast center in Dubai. Beyond that, however, the
express-package concern hasn't done much out of the ordinary
as a result of the Mideast situation, a spokesman says.
   Cannon Express Inc., a Springdale, Ark., trucking concern,
said it won't cut back on services, but would definitely be
applying additional surcharges on freight rates. The amount
of those surcharges hasn't yet been determined, but will
depend on how high oil prices go. About 25% of the 250-truck
company's operating costs are fuel costs.
   Leaseway Transportation Corp. executives decided that
diesel fuel for the company's trucks would rise by at least
10 cents a gallon, and have done some forward buying in the
spot market as a hedge. The executives also concluded that
the rise in energy costs may result in a recession, possibly
world-wide. Leaseway will be watching closely for any signs
that its major customers, including General Motors Corp.,
will be cutting back their hauling. If there are signs of a
cutback, Leaseway will pare its truck purchases and other
capital spending.
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERING
                                                                                                       

   Parsons Corp., a Pasadena, Calif., engineering and
construction firm, has about 100 employees and their
dependents -- including about 30 Americans -- in Kuwait
working on three major projects for the government. It also
has more than 200 employees in Saudi Arabia. Parsons has been
unable to reach any of its employees there since
communications went down just after the invasion Thursday.
With the help of the State Department, Parsons has tried to
reach its employees there every hour for the past five days.
   Fluor Corp., a construction and engineering firm based
Irvine, Calif., has constructed several major projects in
Saudi Arabia and has a "significant number" of employees
there. Fluor and Parsons said they have parts of a project to
overhaul and expand Saudi Arabia's oil and gas production
facilities. Neither company would discuss the estimated value
of the Saudi contracts, but analysts have estimated that each
would get between $2 billion to $5 billion.
   One British engineering concern, NEI Parsons is continuing
work on a #70 million contract to supply Iraq with four
turbine generators destined for an oil-fired power station
north of Baghdad. The contract, due for completion in 1992,
is being funded by a U.K.-government guaranteed line of
credit to Iraq. "We have not heard anything from the British
government to make us alter our position on that. I'd rather
not speculate on what might happen," a spokesman for Northern
Engineering Industries PLC, NEI Parsons's parent, said
yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   OTHERS
                                                                                                       

   Gillette Co. sold $5 million of razors, blades and related
products to the Iraqi government through a bidding process in
1989, the last shipment of which was delivered early this
year. Relations between the company and the country have
recently been severed, said company spokesman David Fausch.
He added, though, that the trade goes both ways: Gillette
uses oil in the petroleum-based plastics in such things as
blade cartridges and disposable razors.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. security chief Bruce
Barr said that as of 11 a.m. EDT yesterday AT&amp;T's more than
three dozen employees were safe in several hotels in Kuwait
City and awaiting directions from the company on evacuation.
But he said AT&amp;T hasn't communicated directly with its
workers since Friday, relying instead on State Department
go-betweens. Mr. Barr runs AT&amp;T's "crisis-management center"
in New Jersey, set up two years ago to devise and distribute
detailed survival and evacuation plans covering each country
in which it operates. In Kuwait, the center is trying to
arrange vehicles to get employees out, but with
communications cut, Mr. Barr admits, "It's damn tough."
