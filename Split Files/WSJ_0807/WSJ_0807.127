   NEW YORK -- With no new shocks from the Middle East, the
dollar fell against European currencies but rose against the
yen in nervous trading.
   Against its European counterparts, the greenback fell
below its depressed levels prior to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. At one point during U.S. and European trading, the
U.S. currency dropped near the absolute post-World War II low
against its German counterpart. The dollar was briefly quoted
at 1.5685 marks, just above the historic low of 1.5615 marks
reached on Jan. 4, 1988.

   The yen outpaced the dollar's decline against the mark and
other European currencies, raising the dollar's yen price.
Japan imports all of its oil, and its decision Sunday to join
the multinational boycott of Iraq, from which 12% of its oil
once arrived, is likely to bring home higher oil prices
quickly.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.3300 Swiss francs and 1.5765 marks, below 1.3510 francs and
1.5935 marks late Friday in New York. Its close against the
mark was its lowest since Dec. 31, 1987, when it ended
trading at 1.5700 marks. Sterling was trading at $1.8725, up
from $1.8565 late Friday. The close was the pound's best
since the first days of 1988.
   The U.S. currency also changed hands late yesterday at
150.32 yen, above 149.99 yen in New York late Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened for trading at 150.75
yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 149.50 yen. Meanwhile,
the U.S. currency was trading at 1.5775 marks; in Tokyo
Monday, it closed at 1.5763 marks.
   The situation around the Persian Gulf remained tense and
trading was described as nervous. Many dealers and investors
were said to have decided to sit out the seemingly arbitrary
activity. The dollar received regular but short-lived boosts
each time a new headline suggested the Kuwait situation won't
be resolved soon.
   In particular, the U.S. announcement that 28 Americans
were being held by Iraqi forces in Kuwait heightened fears
that the U.S. will launch a military strike. The news,
reported about midafternoon in New York, kept the dollar firm
for the rest of the session.
   But the precariousness of the U.S. economy has blocked
much flight-to-quality dollar buying. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunged 93.31 points to close at 2716.34
after having been down more than 100 points at one point in
the session. It was the market's worst performance since its
"mini-crash" last October.
   "I think the dollar's losing some of its safe haven
status," said Michael James, head of interbank dealing at
Midland Bank in London. "People are focusing on the
fundamental weaknesses" in the dollar.
   Added Kevin Weir, a New York vice president with Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, "Europe looks as much like a safe
haven as the U.S., and that is something we haven't seen
before."
   So far, the Swiss franc has been currency of choice. "I
think Switzerland is a safe haven," said Peter Connelly,
foreign exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco. "With its neutrality, its size, its banking
system, if you had a lot of money, where would you put it?"
   Commented Joe Sabbagh, chief currency and metals trader
for European American Capital Corp. in New York, "the Swiss
have always maintained a bit of a security blanket over their
financial instruments. And they're isolated from the game
there."
   Mr. Sabbagh noted that Switzerland is one of the few
countries that have held back from imposing economic
sanctions on Iraq, though late yesterday the Bern government
announced it was preparing sanctions that could be
implemented today.
   Along with its safety, the Swiss franc offers higher
interest-rate yields than other Continental currencies. The
base Swiss interest rate was set at 11% yesterday. The Swiss
National Bank said it sees no need to tighten monetary policy
to counter inflationary pressures from higher oil prices.
   A sharp fall in Japanese stock and bond prices due largely
to fears of higher oil prices and possible increases in
Japanese interest rates helped undo the yen.
   The same forces that have been buffeting the dollar in the
past week can be seen in the U.S. Treasury market, said Mr.
Connelly of Wells Fargo. The U.S. yield curve has steepened
considerably. Short-term bills have been bid up by concerns
about the Iraqi invasion and the increasing prospect of
credit policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Meanwhile,
longer-term bonds, including the 30-year bellwether bond,
have declined on the belief that a Fed easing coupled with
higher oil prices would allow inflation to fester.
   Mr. James of Midland Bank said weak U.S. growth is made
worse by the federal budget deficit. "I can't imagine this
confrontation will help the U.S. reduce its budget deficit,"
he said, summing up why the Mideast tension helped the dollar
so little yesterday.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$387.15 an ounce.
