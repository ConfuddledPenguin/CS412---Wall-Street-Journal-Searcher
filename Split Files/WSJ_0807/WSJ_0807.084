   LONDON -- Burmah Castrol PLC, a British petroleum
producing and refining concern, said it sold its 29.7% stake
in Premier Consolidated Oilfields PLC for 138 million pounds
($256.2 million).
   The 139 million shares were sold through British stock
brokers Kleinwort Benson Securities for 99 pence a share,
Burmah said.

   Kleinwort Benson refused to comment on whether it has
since sold the shares to investors.
   Burmah said it sold the stake to raise cash for investment
in its international marketing of specialized oil and
chemical products. The decision didn't reflect a lack of
confidence in Premier's "long-term prospects," Burmah said.
