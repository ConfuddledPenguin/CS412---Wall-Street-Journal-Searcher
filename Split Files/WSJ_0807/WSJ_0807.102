   General Dynamics Corp., in yet another sign of weakness
among weapons makers, said it would cut up to 2,000 jobs by
the end of next year as it consolidates two of its
missile-making operations.
   The company's Valley Systems and Pomona divisions, both
based in Southern California, currently employ a total of
9,200. Overall, St. Louis-based General Dynamics has a work
force of nearly 103,000.

   "While we all welcomed a diminished threat from the Soviet
Union and the end of the Cold War, these changes have brought
unfortunate personal economic consequences for many people in
the defense industry," said Michael C. Keel, who has been
named vice president and general manager of the new
streamlined unit, the Air Defense Systems Division. "In order
to remain competitive . . . General Dynamics must more
efficiently use its existing resources and reduce overhead."
   The layoff announcement at the nation's No. 2 Pentagon
contractor is part of a giant wave that is rolling through
the arms-manufacturing industry. It is also a reminder that
even as world tensions flare with the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, defense contractors still face diminishing military
budgets and eroding business bases.
   The turmoil in the Persion Gulf "won't really have an
effect unless it becomes a full-blown world incident,"
explained Peter Aseritis of First Boston Corp., adding that
it still behooves companies such as General Dynamics to
"tighten up and buckle down."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Dynamics shares bucked the trend of a widely falling
market and closed at $30, up $1.
   The layoff news came after the Big Board's closing bell,
suggesting that despite the assessment of Mr. Aseritis and
many other securities analysts, investors still believe
defense stocks are a relatively good play now because of the
conflict in the Middle East.
   Just last week, on the eve of the Iraqi incursion, United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engine-building
subsidiary said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs, or 11% of its
domestic employment, over the next three years because of
Pentagon spending cuts. Many other aerospace companies,
including Lockheed Corp., Northrop Corp. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp., also have been trimming their rolls of late.
   At General Dymanics, a spokesman said, corporatewide
employment already has dwindled by 1,150 positions in 1990,
and another 1,700 to 2,000 slots are expected to vanish by
the end of the year. Besides the Standard, Sparrow and
Stinger missiles made at the Pomona and Valley Systems
divisions, General Dynamics also assembles tanks,
jet-fighters and submarines.
   More than 600 of the layoffs at Air Defense Systems will
be the result of disposing of duplicate responsibilities as
the two divisions are joined.
   The company said that between its sites in the Los Angeles
bedroom community of Pomona and nearby Rancho Cucamonga,
where the Valley Systems division is located, it will have
more capacity than is required to meet its future needs.
However, it has not made any decision at this point to move
any of its production lines.
