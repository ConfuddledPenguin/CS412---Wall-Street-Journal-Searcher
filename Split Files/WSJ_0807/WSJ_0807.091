   Convenience Packaging
   Continues to Pile Up

   ENVIRONMENTAL worries haven't slowed the launch of
convenience packages.
   Consider some new items to hit the store shelves: General
Mills sells Cheerios To-Go, a snack size pouch of the cereal.
Seagram's Tropicana Products offers eight-ounce cartons of
orange juice. And several companies sell applesauce in tiny
single-serve containers.
   Marketing Intelligence Service, a Naples, N.Y., research
firm, expects the final tally of 1990 new-product
introductions to reflect a 13% increase in products in
convenience packages, with much of the increase coming from
food and beverages.
   This occurs at the same time consumers express growing
concern over the environment. "Only a minority of consumers
are willing to make a change in life style," so they still
demand convenience, says Judith Langer, president of Langer
Associates, a New York market research firm. "Two
simultaneous trends are coming head to head."
   And convenience seems to win at the checkout lane.
Tropicana's single-serve cartons have been strong since going
nationwide in April. Even the 25% surge in orange-juice
prices since last winter's freeze hasn't hurt sales, says Bob
Urbaine, Tropicana's senior vice president of marketing. One
reason the product is a hit: "It's impossible to carry a
glass of orange juice to work," he says.
   The thermos must be passe.
                                                                                                       

   Sellers May Find
   Scents Make Sense
                                                                                                       

   IF AN AD for an Oldsmobile smells good, will people pay
more for the car?
   Sounds strange, but a Chicago researcher says pleasant and
foul odors can affect consumers' attitudes on spending.
   A study by Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, a neurologist and
psychiatrist at the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research
Foundation, asks consumers to describe their feelings toward
the car commercial, as well as a pair of Nike sneakers, while
different odors -- from floral scents to sewage stench -- are
piped into the room. Those two brands were used because they
are easily recognized by most consumers.
   The test, which will end soon, will show which smells
sell: "Odors will be the marketing tool of the '90s," Dr.
Hirsch says. "The easiest way to impact emotions is through
smell."
   He said several department store chains, along with a
Chicago jewelry store, also are testing smells in their
stores. Another possibility: piping smells into movie
theaters during the pre-movie ads. The sweet smell of cotton
candy, for instance, could be used to entice a G-rated
audience to buy products later.
   Previous smell tests show women generally like the smell
of flowers, while men rate the smell of a back-yard barbecue
No. 1.
   Meanwhile, folks at Oldsmobile are skeptical: "I'm not
sure how we'd use that," says a spokesman. Even the sweetest
aromas can't mask consumers' concerns on price, options and
service, he says. But consumers do seem to like that showroom
smell of new cars: "That's a universally well-liked odor," he
adds.
                                                                                                       

   A La Carte Hotel Services
   Make Bill Easy to Swallow
                                                                                                       

   DINERS LIKE a la carte eating, so maybe it could work for
hotel rooms, too.
   Studio Plus of Lexington, Ky., offers a cross between a
hotel and an efficiency apartment, with rates beginning at
about $160 a week. Guests pay the base rate and then are
charged extra for each trimming, even sheets, towels,
television and telephone. Maid service is $15 a visit, or
guests can borrow the vacuum and clean their own room.
   This month, the company will begin offering franchises
beyond its 10 locations in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and
Tennessee. Its goal is to move into the territory of its
rivals -- extended-stay hotels, such as Marriott's Residence
Inn and Promus's Homewood Suites.
   Studio Plus believes corporate travel departments will
choose the a la carte method to rein in spending: "A lot of
companies are looking at more economical options to house
people," says President Norwood Cowgill Jr.
   The company, which claims an average 85% occupancy rate,
figures it can win on price. Residence Inn and Homewood
Suites charge about $65 to $95 a night, with lower rates for
stays beyond a week. The chains don't offer reduced rates for
guests who want to skip the TV or phone. "People want
everything included," contends a Marriott spokeswoman.
                                                                                                       

   Debate Over Allowing
   National Casino Ads
                                                                                                       

   CASINOS WANT to advertise in all states, even where
gambling is illegal. But opponents say it's a dangerous
temptation for some consumers.
   "Casinos have been prohibited from advertising, and it's a
lost economic opportunity," says a spokesman for Sen. Harry
Reid who, along with fellow Nevada Democrat Sen. Richard
Bryan, is backing legislation to permit casino ads
nationwide. They figure if state lotteries advertise on
television, why can't casinos?
   Harrah's Hotels Casinos wants to advertise across the
country because many of its patrons travel to the tables from
outside Nevada and New Jersey. "We just want to reach our
markets," says a Harrah's spokesman.
   But opponents say the ads should be banned . . . or at the
very least, carry a strong warning. Arnold Wexler, executive
director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey,
wants any ads to carry a toll-free hot line, 1-800-GAMBLER,
where gamblers can get help.
   "There are 12 million compulsive gamblers in the country,"
Mr. Wexler says. And, with state lotteries proliferating:
"There's a big explosion coming."
