   Many take pride in learning the trick
   Of discovering what makes people tick.
   My wish is for some hint or boding
   Of how long they tick before exploding.

   My wife and I jog
   Together a lot,
   Yet there are times
   We surely do not.
   We may run as one,
   Or apart she may tend --
   Depending on whether
   Our color schemes blend.
   -- Joshua Adams.
