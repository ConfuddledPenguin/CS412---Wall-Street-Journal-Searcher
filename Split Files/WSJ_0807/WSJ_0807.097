   LAS VEGAS -- In an aggressive marketing move, Walt Disney
Co. will release the film "Pretty Woman" on video in October,
priced for direct sale to consumers at $19.95, but probably
available for much less from discounters.
   The announcement, at the annual Video Softwares Dealers
Association convention, was somewhat surprising as Disney's
other major hit this year, "Dick Tracy," was seen as a more
likely candidate for sell-through release.

   "Pretty Woman" is a modern-day fairy tale about a female
prostitute. The movie carries an "R" rating and will provide
an alternative in a marketplace glutted with the
child-oriented sell-through releases for Christmas, Disney
executives reasoned. The film is the biggest box-office hit
of the year, grossing about $165 million so far.
   The film will be only the third major R-rated release ever
marketed for sell-through: "Good Morning, Vietnam" and
"Lethal Weapon" were the others, and neither sold close to
the seven million to eight million copies Disney thinks it
can sell of "Pretty Woman."
   The pricing strategy is aggressive because most
sell-through titles are sold at $24.98 and above, and studios
put a minimum advertised price on them to prevent excessive
discounting.
   "The biggest film of the year at the most affordable
price," said Bill Mechanic, Disney's video chief. "I don't
think we're taking risks."
