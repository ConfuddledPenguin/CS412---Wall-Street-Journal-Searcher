   CHICAGO -- Members of the American Bar Association voted
by a narrow margin to rescind a resolution the organization
adopted last February that endorsed a constitutional right to
abortion.
   The 885-837 vote by the ABA Assembly was passed after two
hours of heated debate, and will be considered tomorrow by
the House of Delegates, the policy-making arm of the lawyers'
group.

   The House of Delegates, a representative body of 461
members, is the only group that can set ABA policy. While the
Assembly's vote isn't binding, the House is likely to
consider seriously any suggestion made by the ABA Assembly.
   The abortion debate has divided the ABA, which has 365,000
members nationwide. Yesterday's vote is being closely watched
by Washington policy makers because the ABA's judicial
screening committee plays an important role in evaluating
judicial nominees who will be voted on by members of
Congress.
   At a news conference yesterday after speaking to the ABA,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh underscored his concern that
the ABA's pro-abortion stance could taint the ABA's public
appearance as a neutral evaluator. He said, however, that
since February there has been no evidence that the ABA
screening panel has used abortion as a litmus test in
evaluatating judicial candidates.
   If the House of Delegates fails to adopt the Assembly's
new position on abortion, the Assembly can take a second vote
and force a referendum of the entire ABA membership. Such a
move would be unprecedented, observers said.
   February's resolution recognized "the fundamental rights
of privacy and equality guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution,"
and opposed "legislation or other governmental action that
interferes with the confidential relationship between a
pregnant woman and her physician."
   Approval of the pro-choice policy meant the ABA could file
friend-of-the-court briefs in abortion cases. The ABA could
also lobby against legislation cutting back on abortion
rights. Since the vote, 1,500 ABA members have resigned in
protest.
   Anthony R. Palermo, a Rochester, N.Y., lawyer who proposed
the resolution that would rescind the earlier decision,
argued that the ABA should remain "neutral" in the abortion
debate. His resolution held that the ABA should not adopt a
policy supportive of a particular viewpoint "with respect to
constitutional, moral, medical or other questions involved in
a decision to terminate pregnancy."
   Mr. Palermo's supporters have lobbied for their position,
spending about $70,000 on pollsters, political advisers and
mailings.
   Proponents of the House's earlier resolution have painted
the debate as "pro-choice" versus "no choice." Sara-Ann
Determan, a Washington lawyer who lead the charge to pass an
abortion resolution last February, said yesterday that Mr.
Palermo's resolution "won't create neutrality; it would tell
the nation's lawyers that the ABA no longer supports a
woman's right to choose."
