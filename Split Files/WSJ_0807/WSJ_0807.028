   LONDON -- Retail sales volume in June fell a revised 2.6%
from May and rose 1.1% from June 1989, Britain's Central
Statistical Office said.
   Market forecasts had anticipated the final June figures to
be unchanged from the provisional 2.8% month-to-month decline
and 0.9% year-to-year rise. The index, in which January 1985
equals 100, was 122.4 in June, compared with 125.7 in May and
121.1 in June 1989.
