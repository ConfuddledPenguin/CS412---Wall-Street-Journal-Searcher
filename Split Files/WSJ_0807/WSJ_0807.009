   Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was the novelist for the 60s.
   His primary concerns dovetailed with the fears of a
generation determined to change America's course. His novels
preached the folly of war. They warned of a nightmare future
ruled by machines, not men. They advocated sex. ("Make love
when you can. It's good for you," reads the non sequitur that
ends the introduction to "Mother Night.") The point of view
was an innocent looking out with a mixture of horror and
resignation on a world gone bad.

   The aim, as stated in "Slaughterhouse Five" was a life in
which "everything was beautiful and nothing hurt." If one
phrase from Mr. Vonnegut still rings in aging American minds
it is most likely "So it goes," the gentle-but-cynical words
that follow each of the scores of references to death in
"Slaughterhouse Five." That novel was published in 1969. Not
long thereafter "so it goes" had been used so often in the
Harvard Crimson that editors sought to ban the phrase.
   The easiest thing to say about "Hocus Pocus," (Putnam's,
302 pages, $21.95) is that it is recognizably Vonnegut.
Vietnam, Auschwitz, militarism and the stupidly mega-rich are
bad. Sex is good. Misfortune is everywhere. America is
sinking into a dark night.
   It is 2001. Vietnam veteran and avid fornicator Eugene
Debs Hartke is in prison awaiting trial in the upstate New
York area where many of Mr. Vonnegut's novels take place.
   The purchase of America by foreigners has been galloping
along. Du Pont Co. belongs to Germany's I.G. Farben. The New
York Times is owned by Korean interests. Italians own
Anheuser-Busch Cos. and the Japanese own most of the rest,
including the prison across the lake from the college where
Hartke teaches.
   The Japanese run the prison on a for-profit basis, having
proved they can do it cheaper. But class warfare and
lawlessness are so rampant in the U.S. that the Japanese are
abandoning their investments, simply walking away. There are
reports they will keep Hawaii as a memento of the high-water
mark of their economic empire as the British kept Bermuda.
   The U.S. Army is engaged more or less full time fighting
its own people and responding to emergencies like the mass
breakout from the Japanese-run prison that turns Hartke into
a prisoner himself, because he's suspected of abetting the
prisoners.
   The hot stock of the day is a company called Microsecond
Arbitrage. It turns out, not surprisingly in Vonnegut-land,
to be a sucker play.
   Such a landscape isn't totally unpromising. But since the
'60s, black humor has been a well-worked mine. Novels of a
nuclear bomb-bleak world or post-environmental holocaust
future have been so common you'd think they were required
exercises for novelists, like bar exams for lawyers.
   It isn't enough to look into the future and report that it
is dark. Novels generally need characters and narrative pace.
Mr. Vonnegut often has done without both.
   In "Slaughterhouse Five" he writes, "There are almost no
characters in this story, and almost no dramatic
confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick
and so much the playthings of enormous forces." They also are
playthings for Mr. Vonnegut, who likes to march them onstage,
whirl them around and then dispatch them when the joke or
idea they serve has been exhausted.
   He favors an equal arbitrariness of narrative, often
avoiding transitions in favor of series of brief, telegraphic
blocks of type. Now, in "Hocus Pocus" the method betrays him.
   We are told that prisoner Hartke wrote on scraps of paper
retrieved from wherever he could find them. The novel is
divided by lines on the page representing where each scrap
begins and ends. Some sections are only a line or two long
and few are longer than a single page. It is tiresomely
repetitive and fails to mask that the novel has no momentum
and, ultimately, no point. Unlike the best Vonnegut, "Hocus
Pocus" is so random as to stir no outrage and provoke no
laughter.
   Part of the problem is Hartke. He was the last American
lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon in 1975 and
went from a career in the U.S. Army to a teaching post at a
curious college for the slightly learning-disabled children
of the very rich. His jottings, however, fail to make him
convincing as a soldier, as a lover or as a prisoner. His
gee-whiz digressions to discuss what he has been reading or
thinking about are lifeless.
   "Hocus Pocus" even wheels on stage Tralfamadore, the
planet that captured Billy Pilgrim and put him on display
with Montana Wildhack in "Slaughterhouse Five." But here,
Tralfamadore is debased. Instead of a charming planet of wise
little creatures who see time as a continuum, rather than
living it moment-by-moment, now it is represented by a
renegade group called the Elders who have a cockeyed plan to
spread life through the universe. Hartke comes upon their
story in a skin magazine called "Black Garterbelt."
   In addition to writing on his slips of paper, Hartke is
passing his jailtime drawing up lists of all his sexual
partners and all the people he has killed. Lo and behold, the
lists seem to be of equal length. Some coincidence.
   "Hocus Pocus" is heavy on coincidence and light on
meaning. The title suggests we will be dazzled, but there's
no magic here.
