   NEW YORK -- The New York Mercantile Exchange raised
margins on energy futures after trading ended yesterday.
   Margins, the good-faith deposits necessary to buy or sell
contracts, were increased by $1,000 on crude oil and
petroleum products to stand at $4,500 for customers and
$4,000 for clearing members. Natural gas margins rose to
$2,500 for customers and $2,000 for clearing members, also a
$1,000 jump.

   This is the exchange's second round of energy margin
increases since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week sent
world petroleum prices skyward.
   "When the markets are volatile, we increase the amount of
money people have to put down," a spokeswoman for the
exchange said. "It's a question of protection."
