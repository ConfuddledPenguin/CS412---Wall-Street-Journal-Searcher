   NEW YORK -- A growing arsenal of financial market "circuit
breakers" has helped rein in program trading the past three
sessions and ward off the possibility of an uncontrolled
crash, traders say.
   But the circuit breakers haven't prevented one of the
sharpest sell-offs in the past two years.

   Nearly all of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's
93.31-point drop yesterday came in the first 40 minutes of
trading. Traders said that investors big and small bailed out
of stocks from the opening bell onward because of growing
recession fears and grim weekend news from the Mideast.
   As selling pressure mounted, the New York Stock Exchange
announced restrictions on index arbitrage, a form of program
trading in which investors shuffle money between stock-index
futures and broad baskets of stocks, depending on which is
cheaper.
   The Big Board's latest restrictions took effect only last
month, after being approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They kicked in once the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was down 50 points.
   Also in the first half hour of trading, another set of
circuit breakers took hold at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The widely traded Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
futures sank to 12 points below their close last Friday,
automatically triggering a half-hour trading limit for the
futures at the Merc.
   Simultaneously, the Big Board delayed many program-trading
orders, channeling them into a special order network known as
the "sidecar."
   Big Board President Richard Grasso asserted that circuit
breakers on the Big Board and the Chicago futures markets
"worked extraordinarily well. They contributed to market
stability," he said.
   Index arbitragers weren't quite so certain, though. "It's
an attempt to try to calm the markets," said Eric Brooks, a
managing director at Susquehanna Investment Group, which is
active in computer-aided program trading. "I don't know if it
will have much effect."
   Other program traders said that regardless of the circuit
breakers, they couldn't do much trading yesterday simply
because many major Big Board stocks were slow to open. Stocks
such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Merck Corp. and others were
delayed 20 minutes or more in opening.
   In a market rout such as yesterday morning, virtually
every big stock trader becomes a de facto index arbitrager,
carefully watching stock-index futures (which allow investors
to bet on the movement of a stock basket like the S&amp;P 500
without owning the stocks) and avoiding big stock purchases
until futures and stock prices are closely in line. At times
yesterday morning, S&amp;P futures were as much as five points,
or 1.5%, below the S&amp;P index itself.
   "A lot of people are frozen," said Mark Loehr, an equity
trader at First Boston Corp. He said that the circuit
breakers "slowed the market's drop."
   Under the Big Board's new regulations, index arbitragers
are effectively precluded from piling on more sell orders in
a steeply falling market. Once the Dow industrials fall 50
points, the Big Board requires that any additional stock
sales by index arbitragers be done only if the most recent
price change in those stocks was an uptick.
   The Big Board's Mr. Grasso argues that the new rule could
help make index arbitragers more of a stabilizing influence
in a slumping market. That's because the arbitragers could
only sell into rallies once the Dow has fallen 50 points, but
they could buy at any time. But index arbitragers, who
contend that all of their trading simply helps keep the
market liquid, aren't thrilled about the curb.
   "It's their exchange; they can do whatever they want," one
index arbitrager at a pension-fund manager said. "This may
make people feel better, but it increases the cost of
trading. It just adds to market uncertainty."
