   NEW YORK -- If the twin dangers of war and recession
dominate the market's outlook, are any stocks worth buying?
   Yes, according to Wall Street strategists, who say that
investors can try to immunize their portfolios with stocks
that should hold up reasonably well, or even rise, in the
current troubled market.

   Among their favorites are oil and energy-related companies
that should benefit from higher oil prices and selected food,
tobacco and drug companies whose products should keep selling
even in an economic slump.
   Oil and oil-service stocks have risen sharply in the past
week as the rest of the market fell back. But stock
strategists are nearly unanimous in their belief that bigger
price gains will come as the world gets used to the idea of
paying well over $20 a barrel for crude oil.
   "The revaluation of oil stock prices is going to take a
while, to think about the effects of $25-a-barrel crude oil
vs. $15-a-barrel crude," says Edward Kerschner, chairman of
the investment policy committee at PaineWebber. "If oil
prices settle in the mid-20s per barrel, there's still
another 10% to 15% left in the oils and more than that in the
oil services," Mr. Kerschner says.
   Texaco, Amerada Hess, British Petroleum, Unocal and
Atlantic Richfield are Mr. Kerschner's favorites among the
oil companies; Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Smith
International and Rowan are his choices in the oil-services
group.
   "We think oil stocks are attractive on a longer-term
basis," says Michael Metz, chief market strategist at
Oppenheimer. "The developments in the Mideast indicate that
the secular direction of oil prices should be higher," Mr.
Metz says. Arco is Mr. Metz's pick among the oils; he adds
that Tosco, an oil refiner, has probably been beaten down too
far and might be attractive.
   There's less agreement about which stocks investors should
buy to prepare their portfolios for recession. But one theme
dominates: "defensive" stocks, or shares in companies whose
products will be among the last that consumers give up when
times get tough. These include food, drug and cigarette
makers plus electric and telephone utilities.
   "People will still need medicine and buy food," says Mr.
Metz, who recommends Albertson's, a well-regarded supermarket
chain, and Coca-Cola. Among drug manufacturers, Mr. Metz
favors Schering-Plough and Syntex.
   John Hoffmann, associate director of research at Smith
Barney, says that firm is largely sticking with the
recommendations it had in place before Iraqi tanks rolled
into Kuwait last week. He says Smith Barney had been
recommending that investors overweight their stock portfolios
in energy, putting 17% into energy companies compared with
the energy sector's 13% weighting in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   Among energy stocks, Mr. Hoffmann likes Texaco, Amerada
Hess, Amoco and Anadarko Petroleum, with Halliburton and
McDermott International as oil-service plays.
   Among the consumer-oriented stocks, Mr. Hoffmann suggests
Philip Morris plus drug stocks such as Baxter International,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Warner Lambert and SmithKline Beecham.
   As a defensive move, Smith Barney on Friday increased its
recommended weighting for utility stocks to match the group's
proportion in the S&amp;P 500. Mr. Hoffman suggests Pacific
Telesis and GTE among telephone companies and Commonwealth
Edison and PacifiCorp among electric utilities.
   But some strategists suggest avoiding utilities, despite
their reputation as classic defensive stocks. They worry that
long-term interest rates will remain stubbornly high this
time, even if the economy falls into recession. Utilities
tend to have heavy borrowing costs, so their stocks usually
fare poorly when interest rates are high.
   "We could have an unusual recession where longer-term
rates are going to be slow to go down," says Mr. Kerschner of
PaineWebber.
   Instead of utilities, Mr. Kerschner prefers as defensive
buys companies with a large percentage of their sales abroad,
figuring their earnings will benefit from a weak dollar. As
examples, he cites Merck, a drug maker, as well as Coca-Cola.
He also views Philip Morris as a well-positioned defensive
buy.
   Carime Grigoli, chief portfolio strategist at First
Boston, also is talking about defense, but he means the kind
practiced at the Pentagon.
   "The stocks I would be willing to step up and buy are
either oil-related or defense-related," says Mr. Grigoli, who
recommends Texaco, Unocal and Mobil among the oils; Coastal
as a natural-gas play; and E-Systems, which makes defense
electronics systems, to profit from increased demand for
electronic military surveillance gear.
   For long-term investors -- whom Mr. Grigoli defines as
those willing to watch the prices of their stocks go down 25%
"without losing any sleep," he recommends selected
consumer-oriented stocks. They include food producer CPC
International, Procter &amp; Gamble and health care and
personal-care giants Johnson &amp; Johnson and Gillette.
   Mr. Grigoli's near-term view of the overall market,
however, is decidedly negative. Yesterday, he predicted that
the Dow Jones Industrial Average will fall to 2500 because of
rising oil prices and a weakening U.S. economy. In a
full-blown recession, Mr. Grigoli expects the market would
trade still lower.
   Given the stock market's current volatility, Mr. Grigoli
also believes a 50 or 100-point rally in the industrial
average is a real possibility, especially if the U.S.
launches a successful military strike at Iraq. But in that
case, Mr. Grigoli says, "I would use it as an opportunity to
sell" other stocks.
