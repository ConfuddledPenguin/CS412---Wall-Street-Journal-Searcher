   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Waste Management Inc.'s stock came
under heavy selling pressure after a Barron's article
questioned some of the waste hauler's accounting treatments.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading of 2.8
million shares, the stock slumped $3.125, to $36.375,
slashing the company's market value more than $1.2 billion.
Despite the stock market's overall decline yesterday, Waste
Management said it believes the Barron's article was the
primary reason its stock opened yesterday morning down five
points, but James Koenig, chief financial officer, said that
by trading's close, the stock's drop was in line with other
growth stocks.

   Waste Management issued a statement standing by its
accounting and asserting that the article "flies in the face
of reality." The company also said its outside auditors,
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Chicago, had reiterated their
support for Waste Management's financial statements.
   The article in Barron's, which like The Wall Street
Journal is published by Dow Jones &amp; Co., questioned a $70.8
million gain Waste Management realized last year when a
company it owns a majority stake in, Chemical Waste
Management, sold some stock. The article also questioned
Waste Management's practice of amortizing goodwill from
acquisitions over 40 years, the maximum allowable time to
write off such intangible assets.
   The article was written by Abraham J. Briloff, an
accounting professor.
   Both treatments are allowable under generally accepted
accounting principles. Waste Management said it had booked an
earlier gain related to the sale of some Chemical Waste
Management stock, and the 1989 sale had to be treated
consistently.
   As for the 40-year goodwill schedule, a spokesman said
that over the 20 years the company has made acquisitions of
local trash-collection businesses, many of those operations'
values have increased "significantly." On landfills, which
have a limited life, Waste Management writes off the good
will over a shorter period.
   "We want to reassure all of our investors that our
financial statements are comprehensive, complete, meet the
highest accounting standards and exhaustively represent their
interests," the company said.
   The combined impact of not realizing the Chemical Waste
gain and of writing off good will much faster could have
reduced Waste Management's reported profit for 1989 more than
$170 million, according to the Barron's article. Net income
for the year was $562.1 million, or $1.22 a share, on revenue
of $4.46 billion.
   Marc Sulam, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. who has
recommended Waste Management stock for several years, noted,
however, that the company has billions of dollars of
unrealized gains on its Chemical Waste shares and on its
landfill holdings. He said the company's lofty stock price of
about 29 times earnings is based on its leading market share
in a growing business that is difficult for others to enter.
