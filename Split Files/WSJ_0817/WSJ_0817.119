   Western Union Corp. holders of its preferred shares
approved the company's plan to reclassify the preferred as
common, at a reconvened annual meeting in Upper Saddle River,
N.J.
   The reclassification, which required approval by holders
of at least two-thirds of the preferred, is a critical part
of the financial services and communications company's
recapitalization plan. Western Union has said it might have
to make a bankruptcy filing unless it can recapitalize.

which the company is seeking at least 95%, and $30 million of
16% notes, of which it is seeking at least 80%.
   The exchange offer was extended to next Monday from last
Wednesday.
