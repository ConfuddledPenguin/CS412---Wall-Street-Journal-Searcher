   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it would stop
distributing its newswires through Bloomberg L.P. starting in
September 1991.
   Bloomberg distributes prices of financial instruments,
including stocks and bonds, and provides analytic features
through its terminals. About three months ago, Bloomberg
began a newswire, Bloomberg Business News, that carries
corporate news announcements, bond market coverage and
foreign exchange reports, among other features.

   A Dow Jones spokesman said it acted under its longstanding
policy against distributing its news services through
competitors. "This decision has no bearing on our
relationship with other vendors," he added.
   Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's
magazine, and community newspapers, and operates the Telerate
Inc. electronic financial information system.
