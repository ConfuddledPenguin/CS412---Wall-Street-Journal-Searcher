   Unocal Corp. said it will lift its one-week freeze on U.S.
wholesale prices of gasoline; a spokesman said that prices
would go up by one cent today in some Western states.
   The Los Angeles-based company implemented a one-week
freeze Aug. 9 in response to a call by President Bush to act
responsibly in the wake of world oil-price rises created by
the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait.

   Amoco Co. has also lifted its freeze on wholesale
gasoline, jet fuel and distillate prices; but Atlantic
Richfield Co. said it will continue its freeze indefinitely
at both wholesale and retail levels.
