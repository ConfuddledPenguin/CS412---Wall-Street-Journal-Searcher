   Jet buyers appear to be closing their wallets after a
two-year spending spree, and some aircraft-industry players
worry the retrenchment could lead to an unexpectedly big
downturn.
   As the market for large commercial aircraft softens, plane
sellers, parts suppliers and carriers say an overcapacity of
passenger jets -- particularly narrow-bodies -- has surfaced
during the past few months, especially in the U.S.

   It's a situation that was in the making even before the
Iraqis stormed into Kuwait, forcing oil prices higher. And it
threatens to damp expansion plans at the Big Three aircraft
manufacturers, Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the
European consortium Airbus Industrie.
   "At the moment, you can't say it's terribly serious, but
there is certainly cause for concern," says Paul Turk, an
analyst at Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm. "The
airlines have been adding seats faster than the system can
absorb them. That depresses yields. And if we continue to see
a fall in passenger traffic and the continuation of depressed
yields, carriers are going to start walking away" from
aircraft buys.
   Airline yields, important indicators, measure the amount
of revenue for each mile they fly a passenger.
   Some airline executives who refrained from placing huge
orders are now openly gloating. "Some of these plane orders
are coming back to roost," says Trans World Airlines owner
Carl Icahn, who only ordered limited numbers of jets in
recent years. "Everybody was jumping on that bandwagon, and
I'm glad that we didn't." Mr. Icahn says the $1.2 billion TWA
has in cash will be more valuable than a fleet of new planes
in an economic downturn. A recession could badly hurt the
struggling carrier.
   "Domestic growth just isn't occurring at the rates most
had been expecting," says an executive at one major aerospace
supplier. His company predicts that airliner deliveries will
average about 600 a year through the end of the decade -- not
a level of more than 1,000, which is the figure arrived at if
the projected production schedules at the Big Three are
totaled. "Six hundred is wonderful," he says, "but somebody
is wrong, and swings can still kill companies."
   Many experts discount the Doomsday predictions, noting
that orders for wide-body jetliners remain robust and air
traffic continues to surge on international routes, primarily
in the Pacific Rim. The East Bloc, meanwhile, could turn into
a fertile selling ground for Western plane makers.
   At Farnborough, the aerospace industry's big air show next
month in England, each of the Big Three is likely to announce
a number of large bookings. On top of that, UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines remains ready to purchase as much as $15
billion in aircraft once its buy-out situation becomes
clearer; British Airways PLC, among others, is also shopping
around.
   Still, the overall trend in firm orders is decidedly
downward. Boeing has received bookings for 255 jets, valued
at $24 billion, so far this year, compared with 659 aircraft
valued at $34 billion to this point in 1989, a record amount.
At McDonnell Douglas, orders have slipped to 103 planes from
113.
   Across the industry, placements for narrow-body aircraft
dropped 59% through June to 312 from 766.
   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst at Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc., says he recently scaled back his
projections for new orders this year at market leader Boeing
to $40 billion from $45 billion, and he sees the figure
falling to $25 billion for 1993. But he believes the decline
shouldn't have much of an effect on the manufacturer's
profitability. That's because the Seattle company is working
off a backlog that already is big enough to keep it busy for
three or four years, and that reservoir should continue to
swell through 1992.
   A Boeing spokesman notes that the company is pushing ahead
with plans to launch a new twin-jet, the 777, and remains
firmly committed to ramping up its production rates.
   "We're not getting calls for wholesale cancellations,"
adds William Messecar, a top business planner for McDonnell
Douglas's commercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif. "If
you look at the order curve of the past few years, we just
can't keep going up that slope. But that doesn't mean the
industry is going in the tank, either."
   Yet others are more bearish, predicting that if the
economy slows enough, "options," or less-than-total
commitments that airlines have taken for planes, could
evaporate. Even firm orders, some say, could begin to
disappear.
   "The timing of a recession matters a lot when it comes to
buying and selling aircraft," says Jerry Lundquist, who has
done a detailed analysis of the commercial jet market for
McKinsey &amp; Co., the management consultants.
   His research suggests the start of a long, largely
unanticipated slide in orders and, ultimately, less output
from the Big Three. One big factor in his analysis, he says,
is that older Boeing 727s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s aren't
being retired as quickly as many had anticipated. Even with
the improved fuel-burn and smaller cockpit crews that newer
planes feature, "older aircraft are still economically
competitive," Mr. Lundquist contends.
   Coupled with the spate of newer planes starting to be
delivered, the result is the current glut of narrow-bodies.
"The industry has gone through this again and again," Mr.
Lundquist says. "It's either feast or famine."
   At some point, of course, the recent aircraft buying
frenzy will squeeze the oldest planes into retirement. But
because of the flood of available aircraft, the resale market
will weaken.
   And if airlines are getting less money for their older
planes as they turn them over to freight haulers and other
secondary users, it crimps their ability to make capital
outlays for new aircraft.
   Already, the market's foundation seems to be cracking a
bit. In June, USAir Group Inc. postponed delivery of a dozen
Boeing 737s for more than three years because of slowing
traffic growth, although at the same time it placed orders
for 24 additional planes. Marc Desautels, president of
Polaris Aircraft Leasing Corp., says he understands that
other deferrals by airlines "are in the works."
   Among the carriers that may backtrack, Delta Air Lines is
said to be studying a decision not to exercise options on
some MD-80s, although the company says it won't do that.
Midway Airlines already has canceled some of its options on
MD80s. The small Chicago-based carrier also plans to return
three DC-9s to a leasing company at the end of the third
quarter when the leases expire.
   Midway executives say it's a good thing that new planes
they have ordered won't be delivered until the end of 1991,
limiting fleet growth until then. "We think the economic
climate is soft," says Alfred Altschul, the company's chief
financial officer.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, with its accompanying rise in
fuel costs and threat of economic repercussions, only
exacerbates the potential for worsening profits at the
airlines and, in turn, plane makers. "It's grim," says
Michael Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp. Recently, American officials
started reducing their traffic-growth expectations based on
advance booking levels, which indicate how many seats are
reserved on a flight before it departs.
