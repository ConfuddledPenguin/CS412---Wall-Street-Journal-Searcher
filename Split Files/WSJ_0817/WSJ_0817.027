   Everyone once knew that the affairs of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) were managed from that ancient
red-brick fortress called the Kremlin. Now it is not so
clear.
   If you wander along the Moscow River from the Kremlin you
come to the gleaming, socialist-modern capitol of the Russian
Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (R.S.F.S.R.), better
known as Russia. The R.S.F.S.R. has just issued a decree
asserting that its laws supersede those of the U.S.S.R.
Foreign firms were left guessing which one controls trade and
resources.

   DeBeers Centenary A.G., a Swiss firm set up earlier this
year by DeBeers Consolidated Mines, Ltd., is caught in the
middle. Its mission was to lasso independent diamond
marketers and haul them into the DeBeers cartel, restoring
DeBeers's global monopoly. DeBeers Centenary thought it had a
major coup last month in signing a contract with a U.S.S.R.
agency called Glavalmazzoto to buy $5 billion in Russian
diamonds over the next five years. But after the R.S.F.S.R.
sovereignty decree, the chairman of the legislative committee
of the Russian parliament said the contract was invalid. Only
Russia can sell Russian diamonds, he asserted.
   The official, Sergei Shakhrai, also threatened punishment
for writing contracts outside Russian law. Presumably, folks
at Glavalmazzoto could be shipped to Russian Siberia to
personally dig gems out of the frozen ground while reflecting
on the sin of not knowing who was boss.
   DeBeers doesn't seem overly concerned and maybe the rivals
will meet halfway, somewhere along the Moscow River, to
compromise. But meanwhile, creditors to the
U.S.S.R.-R.S.F.S.R. have a right to be nervous. A compromise
on who owns resources wouldn't necessarily cover who's
responsible for foreign debt. With the U.S.S.R.-R.S.F.S.R.
economy tottering, gold and diamonds are much in demand as
collateral for that debt.
   There is a solution: Privatize Glavalmazzoto (and maybe
give it a new name). Then neither Moscow would own the
resources. But don't hold your breath.
