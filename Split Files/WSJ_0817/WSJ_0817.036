   British financier Sir James Goldsmith speaking to the
Institute of Directors in London on June 12:

<TEXT>
   Let me quote the Nobel prize laureate, Maurice Allais: ".
. . Europe is already overpopulated. Therefore, it is
imperative to stop immigration. . . ."
   I would add that not only are we overpopulated, but also
we have a multitribal and unproven community. To add large
quantities of immigrants of different cultures would produce
an explosive mix.
   There is a free movement of peoples in Europe, so the
whole of Europe is affected by the immigration policies of
each nation. Immigration must be determined by the European
constitution and, "inter alia," the real meaning of the
surviving arrangements between all former colonial powers and
their ex-colonies must be reassessed unflinchingly.
