   It's difficult to recognize the real U.S. Air Force and
its secretary, Donald B. Rice, from your July 9 profile of
them. You inaccurately single out the Air Force as the
service most resistant to charge and inattentive to program
management.
   On the one hand, Secretary Rice and the Air Force are
depicted as stubbornly inflexible. Elsewhere, they are
faulted for adjusting priorities and "turning their backs" on
ICBM modernization.

   In response to changing global circumstances and budget
realities at home, the Air Force agreed to terminate its
F-15E long-range fighter, cut the B-2 bomber and C-17
airlifter programs sharply, and make major reductions in its
force structure. Your profile, however, does not tell us
about these or other changes.
   You do not mention that the Air Force has been the pace
setter on the Total Force concept, transferring functions
whenever possible to the Guard and the Reserve. We are not
told the Air Force stood second to none in finding economies
called for by the recent Defense Management Review.
   You seem to hold Secretary Rice to account personally for
imputed shortcomings. Few people who have seen this man at
work would ever describe him as a prisoner of the past. In
his 14 months in office, he has already gained a reputation
as a tough-minded activist.

   Just like the boundless vastness of the skies, Air Force
research and development are limitless. This is a challenging
area of imaginative strategies and constant innovation. The
unending evolvement of superior aircraft and the ensuing
conception of effective revolutionary strategies are all
necessary to the formulation of a positive defense -- or, if
necessary, offense.
   The problems faced by Secretary Rice and Gen. Welch and
their associates require support and understanding, not
undeserved fire or the incendiary observations of critics,
which have little substance under scrutiny and are products
of jealous rivalry.
   In this era of high technology, the conception, design,
manufacture and utilization of superior equipment costs a lot
of money. The days of simply making a spear longer or armor
plate thicker are long gone.
