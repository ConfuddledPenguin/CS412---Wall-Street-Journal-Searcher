   A Chicago-based civil rights group is planning a tougher
game of one-on-one against sneaker-maker Nike Inc.
   Next week, Operation PUSH -- founded by Jesse Jackson
among others -- intends to expand a nationwide campaign to
get the world's largest athletic shoe maker to invest more in
the black community, where Nike sells tens of millions of
dollars of sneakers every year.

   At the end of July, Operation PUSH issued a call for
blacks to boycott the Beaverton, Ore., company; this Monday,
the group plans a series of demonstrations around Nike
corporate headquarters. Among its demands: that Nike name a
black to its board and start doing business with black-owned
banks and advertising agencies.
   "All we're saying is that if Nike re-invests in the
African-American community and does business with us, it
makes good sense and contributes to the financial well-being
of the black community," said the Rev. Tyrone Crider,
executive director of PUSH.
   The group eventually hopes to obtain "moral covenants"
from all U.S. athletic shoe makers. With one of the biggest
shares of the U.S. athletic shoe market, Nike was the logical
place to start, Mr. Crider said.
   Nike says it already contributes plenty to blacks.
   "We are responding to inquiries, and we plan to make
people aware of the things we've done. We do just do it. We
do the things that we think are part of our responsibility as
citizens," said Richard Donahue, president and chief
operating officer.
   Mr. Donahue cited a special store that the company
operates in predominantly black northeast Portland, Ore.,
where profits are split with the community. In the same area
of the city, Nike has sponsored a program to teach young
blacks carpentry skills, a program that has resulted in the
restoration of homes that were either abandoned or used as
havens for drug sales. Most of Nike's estimated $10 million
annual charitable contribution budget goes to minority
programs, he said.
   But PUSH officials contend those amounts pale in
comparison with what the company takes in. Nike estimates
that about 15% of its $2.4 billion in annual revenue comes
from blacks -- and PUSH contends the figure is closer to 30%.
   Boycotts of national corporations are nothing new for
Operation PUSH. In 1980, the group led a 40-day boycott of
Coca-Cola Co. that led to a $30 million agreement to purchase
products and services from black businesses. Kentucky Fried
Chicken signed a "moral covenant" with the group in 1982.
Even though the pact has officially expired, according to a
company spokesman, the concern still works to provide
minority business opportunities in the construction of new
restaurants.
   That also means the stakes in the dispute could be high
for Nike. An effective boycott "could hurt Nike," said Stan
Lanzet, an analyst with Arnold &amp; S. Bleichroeder. "You don't
want to get caught in a controversy about what they are or
aren't doing, and get crucified in the marketplace in the
meantime," he added.
   So far, Nike is denying the group's allegations. Mr.
Donahue says that Portland's black community refuses to
support the boycott. The company's prominent black spokesmen
from the athletic world, including football and baseball
player Bo Jackson and basketball superstar Michael Jordan,
have also declined to support the idea, according to Mr.
Donahue.
   Neither Mr. Jackson nor Mr. Jordan could be reached for
comment.
   Amitai Etzioni, a sociology professor at George Washington
University and the author of book called "The Moral
Dimension," about corporate responsibility and ethics, said
the two groups would have to compromise.
   "Nike is surely right that they have to do business and
they're not a welfare agency, and I'm sure they do contribute
to the community somehow," said Mr. Etzioni. "It is also true
that the minority community has a right to get some of its
money returned to them."
   Any compromise, however, could be off to a bad start.
Already Operation PUSH has accused Nike of initiating a
"national smear campaign" with the response letter it sent to
the organization and simultaneously to newspapers across the
country. The letter accused the organization of launching a
"pre-emptive strike" against the company after Nike's main
competitor, Reebok International Ltd., paid for an ad in
PUSH's magazine.
