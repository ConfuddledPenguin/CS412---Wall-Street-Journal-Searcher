   NEW YORK -- The Actors Equity union will permit a white
actor to play a Vietnamese man of mixed race in a Broadway
production of the hit London musical "Miss Saigon." The vote
by the executive council reverses a stand it took on behalf
of the union's members of color last week.
   In June, the union's committee on racial equality asked
producer Cameron Mackintosh to consider auditioning Asian
actors here for the starring role created in London by
Jonathan Pryce. Mr. Mackintosh refused. Last week union
leaders voted to deny Mr. Pryce permission to play the role.
Mr. Mackintosh canceled the show the next day.

   "Miss Saigon," about the American withdrawal from Vietnam
in 1975, had a record New York advance ticket sale of $25
million.
   The original union stand put a national spotlight on an
Asian-American civil rights issue. But the position was
quickly assailed by arguments over economic consequences,
artistic freedom and racial equality.
   Tisa Chang, director of the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre
here, said Asian-Americans are offended by the physical
posturing and makeup Mr. Pryce uses to portray an Asian. Ms.
Chang vowed to continue to fight "yellow-face" portrayals of
Asian characters.
