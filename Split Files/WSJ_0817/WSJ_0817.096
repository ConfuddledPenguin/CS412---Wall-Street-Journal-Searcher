   HONG KONG -- While pro-democracy demonstrators occupied
Tiananmen Square in May last year, Dening Wang was facing a
pile of work at his office in the nearby Beijing Hotel. The
director of John Colling Associates (China) Ltd. was rushing
to translate a feasibility study on a port project.
   Even after Chinese tanks and troops shot their way into
the square on June 4 of last year, Mr. Wang biked to his
office that morning, undeterred by sporadic shooting outside
the hotel.

   He and the project survived. And after several months
delay, its two foreign participants, Royal Dutch/Shell Group
and Nedlloyd Group, returned to China earlier this year to
resume negotiations. "We took stock of the situation, and
decided that the economic fundamentals are still strong,"
says Tim Brennand, managing director of Shell China Ltd.
   But for each investment plan in China that has gone
forward, several have been axed. The Tiananmen killings
precipitated a dive in direct foreign investment, and the
flow of funds that resumed after the initial period of shock
was far thinner and aimed at fewer projects. China's dire
economic state has contributed to the steady slide, as has
the emergence of the newly democratized Eastern European
countries, which threaten to supplant China as the world's
biggest frontier market.
   "The number of opportunities and the amount of investment
will shrink. There was an energy boom, a hotel boom. But
there won't be another boom," says John Hoffmann, another
director at John Colling, a Hong Kong-based consultant firm.
"But there'll always be opportunities for those with a
serious interest in China."
   The size of the market will continue to draw multinational
companies like Shell, which take a long-term view toward
China. Even so, many companies are adjusting their plans.
Some are reducing the size of their investment, while others
are demanding additional benefits. Still others are shifting
focus to match Beijing's emphasis on such sectors as basic
industries and transportation. In addition, foreign investors
generally are resigning themselves to longer repayment
periods.
   New foreign direct investment, which began to slow in the
third quarter, dropped to a trickle in the first quarter of
this year. According to official Chinese figures, the value
of newly approved contracts fell 42% to $870 million in the
first quarter from the year-earlier period. This follows a
43% drop in the October-December period to $1.13 billion.
   (Actual foreign direct investment has been largely flat
since June 4, 1989, indicating that foreign businessmen have
continued to honor earlier commitments.)
   The drop in new foreign direct investment could have been
more acute had it not been for money from Taiwan. Following
in the footsteps of their Hong Kong counterparts, many Taiwan
exporters are moving their manufacturing bases to China.
Chinese officials estimate that cumulative investment from
Taiwan, valued at about $1 billion at the end of 1989, is
expected to double by the end of this year, surpassing that
from Japan and the U.S. Those two countries are tied for the
No. 2 position as China's biggest foreign investors, after
Hong Kong, which accounts for 60% of the total $15.4 billion
in actual investment as of the end of 1989.
   For Taiwan investors, long blocked from China by the two
nations' political differences, the slight easing of
relations recently has opened up a new investment frontier.
But with Washington and Beijing still trading words over
China's human-rights record since the Tiananmen killings and
multilateral lenders still reluctant to provide China with
new loans, the initial shock of June 4's brutality has been
slow to wear off for many foreign investors.
   In the wake of the killings, Allied-Signal the Morristown,
N.J., aerospace, automotive and engineering-materials
concern, suspended negotiations -- which were at an advanced
stage -- for an automotive-component joint venture. More
recently, William Lee, regional vice president of
Allied-Signal International, returned to China to meet with
officials to test the water, but he hasn't decided yet
whether to pursue the project.
   With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Western
businessmen are showing the kind of euphoria over the Eastern
European market's potential that they once felt for China's.
Eastern Europe has already diverted attention from China,
businessmen say, although it isn't clear whether that shift
has also cost China funds it might otherwise have received.
   China's current economic recession is another deterrent to
foreign investment. Starting from Beijing's austerity program
in late 1988, consumer demand has been steadily weakening.
   Many foreign investors who have remained in China have
toned down their expectations. N.V. Philips, one of the
biggest foreign investors in China's electronics industry,
has nine joint ventures. Cees J. Seelen, president of Philips
Electronics South East Asia Holding B.V., a unit of the Dutch
electronics giant, says the company will be "more selective"
in future commitments.
   Mr. Seelen concedes that weak consumer demand is squeezing
profit growth at the two Philips ventures that are up and
running, but he brushes aside concern over cloudy prospects
for the seven still at preparatory stages.
   One of the seven is a plant to make television picture
tubes, which was initiated when demand for TV sets was high.
With deepening economic retrenchment, domestic sales have
plunged 35% from 1988 levels of eight million to nine
million.
   Even the Shell-Nedlloyd port project, which belongs to the
type of investment preferred by Beijing, isn't entirely
austerity-proof. The plan calls for a $20 million investment
in facilities for the storage and handling of bulk chemicals
and oil near the Tianjin port. The project's Chinese partner,
the Port of Tianjin Authority, is strapped for cash to
complete the transportation facilities leading to the
proposed tanks, according to Shell's Mr. Brennand. As a
result, Shell is reconsidering the scale of investment in the
project.
   Besides rethinking the size of their China investments,
foreign companies also seem to be changing their basic
attitude about doing business in China. Initially drawn by
the lure of a market with 1.1 billion consumers, many
businessmen abandoned their usually hard-nosed attitude when
doing business in China. Now, they have become more pragmatic
and put more emphasis on the bottom line.
   Such is the attitude Allied-Signal's Mr. Lee adopted when
he returned to China recently to study whether the company
would continue to pursue the automotive-component venture.
"We are demanding more benefits to be provided in the area of
foreign-exchange balance, and asking the Chinese to provide
more specifics," he says.
   For its part, Beijing has also undergone a soul-searching
period. As the country's economic problems worsen,
tight-fisted central-government officials are allocating
scarce domestic and foreign funds in accordance with national
priorities. Beijing has always kept a priorities list, but
provincial officials routinely ignored it and favored
investments in fast-earning ventures such as hotels and
consumers goods. Then came Tiananmen, and everybody listened.
   Some foreign businessmen are seeing new advantages in the
central government's reassertion of authority. With Beijing
putting the brakes on consumption and spending, inflation and
construction costs also are being restrained. In addition,
more projects require Beijing's approval, which means that
proposals are more carefully screened.
   "My phone isn't ringing as much as before, but when it
does, the project has a higher chance of success," says Clark
Randt, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in China.
   But despite these advantages, the foreign-investment boom
is definitely over. Even in areas Beijing is targeting, it is
likely to attract only modest capital. That's because such
projects typically require long repayment periods that only a
few multinational companies can afford.
   Besides, many of these projects are only viable if the
output is mass-produced. And China, despite its huge
population, has only a small market for advanced
technological products. Ernesto Harry Grobe, general manager
of Siemens AG's Beijing office, says the sales of some of the
West German electronic group's products in China represent
only one day's production in one of the company's plants in
the West.
