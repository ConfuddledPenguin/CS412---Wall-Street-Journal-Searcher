   NEW YORK -- The dollar fell to another record low against
the mark yesterday before rising slightly above that level.
   The sharp drop, following the currency's strong rally off
its previous low against the mark Wednesday, surprised
currency watchers, who had thought the session would provide
some stability. But an overwhelming crush of bad news for the
U.S. economy won the day over renewed rumblings from the
Persian Gulf.

   A rush of panic selling just after lunch in New York
pushed the dollar below 1.56 marks, a level that had provided
support in European and Asian trading.
   The greenback then stabilized but never rose above that
rate. Toward the end of the day, the U.S. currency set a
record low of 1.5515 marks -- beating its previous low of
1.5525 marks early Wednesday.
   However, the dollar rose marginally later, to be quoted
late in the day at 1.5525 marks, compared with 1.5660 marks
late Wednesday.
   Traders suggested that, as the dollar drifted lower, many
currency dealers who were long, or overbought, on the dollar
had seen their positions eroded and were forced to sell.
Other participants -- mostly dollar bears anyway -- joined
the crowd.
   "The market got caught slightly long dollar," said Baruch
Deutsch, a Lehman Bros. dealer.
   Price swings were exaggerated by spare activity. A summer
market was further thinned out this week by holidays in Japan
and Europe. Some banks, meanwhile, were still closed by the
power outage that hit lower Manhattan Monday.
   Dealers were given plenty of excuses to sell dollars.
   Already concerned by reports of problem loans at Bankers
Trust and Chemical Bank, dealers were greeted yesterday by a
story in this newspaper saying that developer Donald Trump
could have a negative net worth of as much as $294 million.
Mr. Trump had come to symbolize the nation's go-go 1980s.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. reported that housing starts shrank
for the sixth consecutive month in July, marking the longest
string of monthly declines since 1981.
   In the day's other economic release, U.S. consumer prices
were reported to have risen 0.4% in July, despite a fall in
energy prices that month.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.2915 Swiss francs, down from 1.3065 francs late Wednesday.
The U.S. currency was changing hands at 147.25 yen, down from
147.65 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was trading at $1.9090,
up from $1.9006.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 147.8 yen, down a bit from Thursday's Tokyo close
of 147.90 yen. Meanwhile the U.S. currency was trading at
about 1.540 marks; in Tokyo Thursday, it closed at .5660
marks.
   Lost amid the U.S. economic gloom was more bad news in the
Middle East. The much-awaited meeting between President
George Bush and Jordan's King Hussein failed to unveil a
peace plan. Instead, Gulf news yesterday was dominated by an
acceleration in the U.S. military buildup on the Saudi
Arabia-Kuwait frontier and an Iraqi order for all U.S. and
U.K. citizens trapped in Kuwait to gather in a hotel, raising
the possibility of their becoming hostages.
   Meanwhile, an Iraqi spokesman read an open letter from
Saddam Hussein in which the Iraqi dictator told Mr. Bush:
"You will receive American bodies back in bags."
   The dollar is caught in a "constant tug of war," said
Robert White, corporate foreign exchange manager for First
Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles. "There is
little question where the dollar should go: It should go
down. But when you intersperse with that comments from Saddam
about body bags, it gets support."
   Mr. White said the long-dollar positions, whose unwinding
began the dollar's decline, were created in reaction to
Iraq's hostile message.
   The dollar ended European dealings nominally higher,
although the greenback traded narrowly and sometimes
choppily.
   London traders said short covering in the European
afternoon helped bring the dollar off its lowest levels and
back to its intraday highs. Against the yen, the U.S. unit
climbed on the back of strengthening spot oil prices.
   Activity in the European Monetary System centered on
mark-lira trading. Although there were no signs of central
bank intervention, the mark rose sharply in hectic and
nervous trading during the European morning. The lira also
lost ground against the French franc as the mark-franc cross
rate remained unchanged.
   Milan traders said German banks started the rally, which
pushed the mark to 735.30 lire, up from 734.20 lire at the
start of the European business day and up from 734.65 lire at
the Milan fixing Tuesday. There was no fixing Wednesday
because of a holiday.
   The dollar finished higher in thin trading yesterday in
Tokyo after news of cuts in Saudi Arabian oil shipments took
the steam out of the yen. The U.S. currency closed at 147.90
yen, compared with its Wednesday close of 147.85 yen.
   Dealings focused almost exclusively on dollar-yen rates.
Tokyo participants were nervous about trying to push the
dollar lower against the mark or other European currencies
after the record low set Wednesday.
   News published at mid-morning that Saudi Arabia would trim
crude oil shipments to Japan in September cut short the yen's
early rally and spurred dollar buying, dealers said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $409.20 an ounce, up $6.60. Estimated
volume was a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$414 an ounce.
