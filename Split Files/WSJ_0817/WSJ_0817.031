   Bringing Back Clutter
   Banished by Computers

   MANY computers in the future may look more like a Post-it
note than like today's familiar desktop machine.
   Researchers at Xerox's Silicon Valley laboratories are
devising prototype computers that seek to mimic low-tech
tools such as note pads and blackboards. Xerox argues that
these mundane items have proven the most efficient tools for
getting the job done.
   For starters, Xerox says it has built a prototype the size
of a pad of Post-it notes, with a liquid crystal screen on
which the user writes text. The pad includes a transmitter
that can zap the writing to other computer tablets ranging in
size from the notes to legal pads and blackboards.
   In Xerox's futuristic vision, which it calls "ubiquitous
computing," an average executive in the mid-1990s would have
a dozen note-sized computers scattered around the office for
quick memos. Legal-pad-sized machines would be stacked on
desks and in conference rooms for note-taking and financial
calculations. The desktop machine would still be there, Xerox
says, but many of its functions would be usurped by the
inexpensive paper-mimicking computers. "We're taking life as
it is and computerizing it," says a Xerox research manager.
   Rapidly shrinking computer chips and recent advances in
handwriting recognition from companies such as Tandy's Grid
Systems unit lend some credence to Xerox's model. Moreover,
Xerox's lab, where engineers and sociologists gaze into
crystal balls together, has been right before. In the
mid-1970s, it came up with ideas that eventually made their
way into the Apple Macintosh.
                                                                                                       

   Weather Nuts With PCs
   Can Chart Fronts Galore
                                                                                                       

   WHO NEEDS the evening news weatherman when a meteorologist
lurks in every personal computer?
   A modem and a piece of software turn a PC into a weather
machine that phones up a central weather-data computer and
translates the data into weather maps and charts on the
screen. One such program, WeatherBrief from the Mindscape
unit of Software Toolworks, Chatsworth, Calif., dials up a
weather computer in Salt Lake City used by newspapers and TV
forecasters.
   To save phone charges, the $50 program prompts the user to
type out a shopping list of weather information ahead of
time. The program automatically dials up, obtains data, hangs
up and converts numbers into charts and maps.
   One day in July, for instance, a $1.98 phone call using
the program showed a 37% chance of rain in Oklahoma City,
soil temperature of 69 degrees in Chicago and 117-degree heat
in Kuwait. The call also generated computer maps of weather
fronts, cloud cover, lightning strikes and a satellite photo
of hurricanes Hernan and Iselle just off Mexico.
   Another Software Toolworks program, Accu-Weather
Forecaster, lets PCs dial into AccuWeather's database to
create graphs and maps. One feature creates a "window" on the
screen that simulates the weather as seen out the window at
any of 1,000 weather stations. Users of the $80 program
include transportation firms, "weather hobbyists" and
nudists, the company says.
                                                                                                       

   Tiny Gadgets Measure
   Cholesterol at Home
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS soon will be able to stay up to the minute on
their cholesterol readings.
   MediSense, Cambridge, Mass., is designing pen-sized
gadgets that let users measure their own cholesterol levels
much as diabetics measure their blood glucose. Until now,
cholesterol testing required technicians using expensive
typewriter-sized lab machines. MediSense's testers, which it
plans to unveil as early as next year probably for less than
$200, use "biosensors" -- electrodes that combine electronics
and an organic material ferrocene -- to measure cholesterol.
   MediSense won't discuss details of its pens, which still
need regulatory approval. But it says the gadget will shrink
the innards of a bigger model -- the size of a desk
calculator -- that it will place in pharmacies this fall. "A
person picking up toothpaste can get his cholesterol checked
right on the spot," a MediSense official says.
   With both models, a customer uses a disposable
finger-pricking device and places a blood drop on the
biosensor embedded in a paper strip. The blood's cholesterol
molecules react with chemicals in the paper, creating a faint
current that the sensor measures in about 20 seconds,
compared with the five minutes needed by conventional
equipment.
   The tester meets federal guidlines for accuracy, says
MediSense, which hopes for a replay of the success of its
pen-sized testing devices used by diabetics. The company also
says it's studying uses of biosensors to test blood levels of
drugs and alcohol.

   Typists Sick of `Mice'
   Get a Reprieve From `J'
                                                                                                       

   HERE'S RELIEF for mouse haters.
   Accomplished touch-typists often dislike the computer
"mouse" -- the device that is rolled around on the desktop to
manipulate the screen's pointer -- because a hand on the
mouse means a hand off the keyboard. Home Row, Clackamas,
Ore., has a tiny gadget that converts the keyboard's "J" key
into a surrogate mouse when the typist holds down the "alt"
key.
   The typist pushes the J slightly forward, backward or
sideways, and a "force sensor" hiding under the key's cap
detects the movement and translates it into a cursor
movement. Releasing the alt key returns the J to normal.
   Home Row has licensed its technology to keyboard maker Key
Tronic, Spokane, Wash., which says it expects a market among
laptop-computer makers.
