   You've only got a few minutes to negotiate the biggest
purchase of your life. A crowd of strangers is watching, and
a silver-tongued auctioneer is running up the price. Crack.
The gavel falls.
   It's hard to imagine a more nerve-wracking way to buy a
home. Yet, as the nationwide real estate slump continues,
home auctions are spreading from the Farm Belt to the suburbs
and the big cities.

   Once employed almost exclusively to unload foreclosed
properties, auctions are being used more and more as a
marketing tool by real estate developers. Roughly $26 billion
of residential and commercial property was sold at auction
last year, up from $10 billion in 1980, according to Stephen
Martin, president of Gwent Group, a Bloomington, Ind.,
auction-consulting firm.
   But prospective buyers eager to grab up choice properties
at bargain prices may be disappointed. Home auctions
generally offer only modest savings, at best.
   Last May, New York City architect Stephen Chiang went to a
condominium auction in Manhattan hoping to buy a one-bedroom
apartment. But one-bedroom units in the new luxury
development went for about $50,000 more than he could afford.
Mr. Chiang ended up paying $132,000 for a studio apartment on
the 21st floor.
   "Looking back on it, I don't think the savings were that
significant," he says.
   Ads touting luxury properties with minimum bids that are a
fraction of their original asking prices do nothing to
discourage the notion that homes can be purchased on the
cheap. Steven Good, president of Chicago-based Sheldon Good &amp;
Co., one of the nation's largest real estate auctioneers,
says he typically sets opening bids at 30% to 40% of the
original price.
   To further entice prospective buyers, many developers
offer a small block of units "absolute," which obligates them
to accept the winning bid, regardless of how low it is.
   In practice, however, homes sold at auction seldom go for
rock-bottom prices, auctioneers say. The advertising attracts
large crowds, and the large crowds tend to bid up the price
to close to market levels.
   For example, in June 1989, more than 3,000 people flocked
to Connecticut's first residential real estate auction to bid
on 48 condominiums in East Haven. "Clearly, the audience was
packed with people who showed up and thought they were going
to get units for $1," says Steven Kerschner of Nolan K.
Kerschner Co., the Norwalk, Conn., developer of the property.
   Instead, the average buyer paid about $180,000 a unit,
probably not too much below market value, says Mr. Kerschner.
   If the sale is energetically promoted, "people pay fair
market price at a given day at an auction," says Gwent's Mr.
Martin. He says his firm's clients have netted anywhere from
74% to 95% of the appraised value of the properties they've
sold at auction. But because developers frequently use
outdated appraisals, these figures exaggerate the actual
discounts, says Mr. Martin.
   Even being the only bidder interested in a property
doesn't guarantee that you'll get a bargain. Developers
usually offer most of their units with a "reserve" option,
which gives them the right to reject the winning bid, even if
it exceeds the minimum bid price advertised before the
auction. Developers also reserve the right to halt the
auction midstream if the properties aren't fetching adequate
prices.
   Despite the drawbacks, people in the auction business say
such sales can be attractive for savvy buyers. "The effect to
the buyer is that it allows him to take advantage of bulk
sale prices without having to buy a number of units," says
Mr. Good. In addition, buyers can expect to close in a matter
of days, and secure below-market-rate financing through a
mortgage lender brought in by the developer.
   In general, auctioneers caution that prospective buyers
should do extensive homework before bidding on a property.
Most important, they say, is a visit to the property -- which
is typically open for inspection for several weeks before the
sale.
   Because properties are sold "as is," bring along an
expert: a contractor, an architect, perhaps even an
appraiser. If you don't get an independent appraisal, visit
comparable properties in the area and find out what they are
selling for. Then, set a bidding limit.
   Mr. Good says that the single biggest problem for would-be
buyers is they "don't read the terms of the auction, and that
goofs them up." If the property is a condominium, closely
scrutinize the prospectus and offering plan, which should
contain such critical information as the offering statements,
title report, condominium budgets and association budgets. If
you don't understand them, show them to a lawyer.
   Remember that you can't get through the door to many
auctions without a cashiers check or certified check for 10%
of the minimum opening bid.
   Finally, get to the auction early. Often, the auctioneers
will announce that certain units have been taken off block
and that mortgage interest rates have changed.
   While several states -- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
and Florida are among them -- give buyers a few days after
the auction to back out of a sale, most offer no such
protection. That makes it critical for potential buyers to
know exactly what they want to do when the bidding starts.
   "Typically, we sell a property every two or three
minutes," says Mr. Good, "which doesn't leave a whole amount
of time for indecision."
