   WASHINGTON -- A federal agency that provides retirement
and unemployment benefits for railroad workers is vulnerable
"to fraud and abuse involving hundreds of millions of
dollars," the chairman of a House committee said.
   Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), in a letter to Budget
Director Richard Darman, said that auditors for the Railroad
Retirement Board's inspector general reviewed 19 railroads
and found "$73 million in nonpayment of taxes, including
interest and penalties." The payroll taxes fund the benefits
for the nation's railroad workers. More than 1,100 railroads
weren't audited, Rep. Conyers noted.

   In addition, Rep. Conyers, who heads the Government
Operations Committee, said that the Treasury Department
didn't transfer $152.6 million in tax receipts to the
railroad board for four months, costing the retirement trust
funds about $4.4 million in interest.
   The findings "show an alarming lack of oversight by the
Treasury Department and significant under-reporting of
payroll taxes by railroad employers," Rep. Conyers said. He
cited an inspector general's report that concluded that the
Internal Revenue Service hadn't adequately monitored railroad
compliance with tax laws. The IRS and a Treasury Department
spokesman said they hadn't seen Rep. Conyers's letter and
couldn't comment.
   A senior Bush administration official, who asked not to be
named, said Rep. Conyers was piggybacking on the
administration's work. He said a White House budget office
"swat team" from various federal agencies uncovered serious
problems in the railroad retirement program earlier this
year. The administration, he said, notified Rep. Conyers and
others in Congress. He said the administration is preparing
corrective legislation.
