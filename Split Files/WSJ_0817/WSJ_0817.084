   NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and a few other financial
institutions are promoting a controversial new tax strategy
that has allowed major U.S. corporations to save hundreds of
millions of dollars in taxes on gains from assets sales.
   The tax strategy typically involves the creation of a
partnership with several investors that generates losses that
a corporation can use to offset its gains on assets sales.
Some of the partnerships include the businesses being sold,
but others don't.

   This tax-shelter strategy has been questioned by some tax
lawyers and investment bankers. Some of Merrill's
competitors, including First Boston Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp;
Co., aren't recommending the technique to clients, saying it
may not withstand scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service.
   An IRS spokesman said the agency is already "looking into
whether the tax consequences are proper."
   About a dozen big corporations are believed to be pursuing
variations of the tax-shelter strategy. Paramount
Communications Inc. is said to be pursuing the strategy in
connection with the $3.35 billion sale of its Associates
finance unit last year.
   Paramount won't comment on its tax strategies. Paramount
had previously listed $763.4 million on its financial
statements as a provision for taxes on the Associates sale.
   Schering-Plough Corp., a maker of pharmaceutical and
health-care products based in Madison, N.J., hinted that it
is using such a tactic to offset a gain on the $300 million
sale last month of the company's Maybelline cosmetics
division.
   Schering-Plough said the gain on the Maybelline sale
wouldn't be fully realized this year because of "various
nonrecurring offsetting charges." Although Schering wouldn't
comment on the accounting details, it said it has recently
"invested in a partnership which holds principally high-grade
short- and medium-term investments."
   At Merrill, the tax strategies are being promoted by a
group led by E.S. Purandar Das, a managing director who heads
Merrill's special advisory services. Last year, Mr. Das was
one of Merrill's best-paid investment bankers, earning more
than $2 million, according to Wall Street estimates. Mr. Das
wasn't available to comment.
   In a statement, Barry Friedberg, head of investment
banking at Merrill, said: "We do not offer tax advice and we
do not have a specific product. Our clients consult with
their legal and accounting advisers and our role is to
provide insights regarding the financial markets and execute
financing transactions."
   Wall Street executives say Citicorp and Bankers Trust New
York Corp. have promoted similar tax strategies for their
clients. Neither bank would comment.
   Other corporations believed to have pursued such
strategies include American Home Products Corp., which sold
its Boyle-Midway household products unit for $1.25 billion in
June, and Colgate-Palmolive Co., which sold its Kendall
health-care unit for $900 million in 1988. Both companies
declined to discuss the accounting for the assets sales.
   In one example of the tax strategy, three parties form a
partnership to acquire a fixed-income security that doesn't
trade publicly. The first party -- typically a company that
doesn't have to pay U.S. taxes -- puts up 90% of the cost,
the second party puts up 9% and the third party puts up 1%.
   The partnership then sells the security in an installment
sale, receiving most of the sale proceeds immediately and the
remainder in the third year in a payment contingent on the
security's market value at that time. But in the second year,
the first party drops out of the partnership.
   Because the partnership must subtract one-third of the
security's book value from the sale proceeds in each year,
the partnership will show a big gain in the first year, and
will then show losses in the second and third years. The
first party thus gets most of the gain, and the second party
-- which needs the tax shelter -- gets most of the losses
after the first party drops out. The third party is only
present to keep the partnership going after the first
departs.
   Although the structure complies technically with
accounting rules, investment bankers say, some of them
believe that the IRS could disallow the losses if the agency
decided the transactions had been arranged mainly for the
purpose of beating a tax bill. Usually, an adverse IRS ruling
means only that the company must pay back taxes plus
interest. But the IRS could impose extra penalties if it
found the transactions to be abusive.
   According to one Wall Street professional, First Boston
chose not to promote such strategies because investment
bankers at the firm weren't sure the strategy would survive
an IRS audit. Another person says J.P. Morgan made the same
decision because its investment bankers considered the
transactions' tax aspects abusive. Neither First Boston nor
J.P. Morgan would comment. One Merrill executive chalked up
those reservations to "sour grapes."
   The development of this new tax strategy follows a general
tightening of corporate tax rules, starting in 1986.
   Matthew Rosen, a tax lawyer at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher
&amp; Flom, said that some recent transactions are "similar to
what we used to see in the tax-shelter industry." On the
other hand, he cautioned, many of the transactions may
involve genuine economic risks that justify their tax
treatment.
   People on Wall Street say offering the partnership tax
strategy has been a profitable line of business for Merrill
at a time when many other investment banking revenues,
particularly for mergers and acquisitions, have faltered
throughout the securities industry.
   But Merrill executives are reluctant to acknowledge
publicly the firm's leadership role in the field, because the
publicity might intensify IRS scrutiny and invite extra
competition from other securities firms. "This is a
low-profile capability," said one Merrill executive.
   Also, Merrill's role could antagonize the firm's big
customer base of small investors, who might not like the idea
that Merrill is helping big corporations beat their taxes.
But one Merrill executive contends that its role isn't any
different than advising individuals to buy tax-exempt bonds.
