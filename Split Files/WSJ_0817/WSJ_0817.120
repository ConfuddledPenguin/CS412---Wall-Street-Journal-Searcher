   BUSH MET with Jordan's King amid fears about Americans
under Iraqi control.
   The two leaders seemed to make little progress toward
resolving the U.S. showdown with Iraq. "I did not come away
from that conversation with any feeling of hope that Saddam
Hussein would" withdraw from Kuwait, Bush told reporters
after his talk with King Hussein, who also acknowledged there
hadn't been any breakthrough. In Kuwait, Iraqi military
authorities overseeing the Kuwaiti occupation declared that
Americans and Britons in Kuwait should assemble at a hotel. A
State Department official said the Iraqis hinted that if
Americans didn't comply, Saddam Hussein would send troops to
round them up.

Germany's shaky coalition, a move that could delay
