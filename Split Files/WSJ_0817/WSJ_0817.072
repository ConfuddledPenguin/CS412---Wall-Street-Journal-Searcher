   The Federal Trade Commission accused the nation's major
coin "grading" service -- until now heralded as making the
rare-coin business safer for investors -- of making numerous
false and misleading claims.
   The lawsuit the FTC filed against the four-year-old
independent coin grader, Professional Coin Grading Service
Inc. of Irvine, Calif., is potentially the biggest blow in
years to the coin world's attempts to improve its image.

   And the case could set back the plans of Wall Street
brokerage firms, including giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., to sell
investors rare coins and limited partnerships that invest in
coins. Brokerage firms, in moving into the coin business,
have pointed to the existence of new independent firms such
as Professional Coin that claim they objectively grade, or
set a precise value on, rare coins.
   Merrill Lynch, for example, is in the midst of marketing
to investors the $50 million NFA World Coin Fund, a limited
partnership that will invest in rare U.S. and foreign coins.
Professional Coin-graded coins will be among those purchased
by the fund, Merrill Lynch says in the fund prospectus. It
points to Professional Coin and other grading concerns to
assure investors of the relative safety of the rare-coin
market. So far, Merrill Lynch has raised $15 million for the
fund.
   But in the civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Washington, the FTC charges that Professional Coin "engaged
in numerous violations" of the Federal Trade Commission Act
in its television and newspaper advertisements and in
promotional materials. The FTC said that Professional Coin,
among other things, hasn't provided the "objective or
consistent grading" it claims, and that the company has
misrepresented itself because "PCGS does not in all cases
observe its `strict anti-self interest policy.'"
   Professional Coin, at the same time the lawsuit was filed,
entered into a consent decree in which it agreed to various
actions, including a mandatory disclosure statement in all
promotional materials: "Certification by PCGS does not
guarantee protection against the normal risks associated with
potentially volatile markets." In settling, Professional Coin
didn't admit liability for the alleged offenses.
   Professional Coin's chief executive officer, David Hall, a
California coin dealer, said: "We see ourselves as good guys,
doing our part to try and make sure coin buyers get a
properly represented product. It seemed unbelievable that we
could be the target of an FTC investigation." He said the FTC
has been investigating the grading concern for three years.
   Mr. Hall said that the FTC complaint "contains some
obviously untrue allegations," but that Professional Coin
settled the case to save court costs. "I'm convinced PCGS
runs the cleanest ship in the grading service business," he
said.
   Improper grading has long been one of the rare-coin
industry's big problems and the cause of numerous
consumer-fraud cases. (Rare-coin collectors, who buy coins
based on rarity and quality, are different from investors who
buy gold, silver and platinum bullion coins priced on their
metal content.)
   Rare-coin buyers are defrauded out of millions of dollars
each year, some regulators and dealers say, when unscrupulous
dealers assign higher-than-warranted grades to boost the
sales prices of their merchandise, while downgrading coins
they purchase to lower the prices they have to pay.
   All this was supposed to be changed under the Professional
Coin system, in which at least three rare-coin experts would
study each coin and make a consensus grade; the coin would
then be sealed in a tamper-resistant plastic "slab" with a
serial number and other identifying data.
   Rare coins are typically classified according to their
condition on a scale that runs from MS-1 to MS-70, with MS
standing for "mint state" and MS-70 signifying almost
unattainable perfection. A slight difference in
classification can change a rare coin's value by thousands of
dollars.
   "Probably the most significant thing about the case is
that coin graders, dealers and certifiers have to be very
careful about the messages they give to the buying public,"
said Phoebe Morse, head of the FTC's Boston office, which
brought the case. "They haven't been careful enough."
   Barry J. Cutler, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer
protection, said the new grading concerns have benefits for
small investors. But they "are being marketed, at least by
PCGS, as providing so much objectivity and so much liquidity,
that it has lured Wall Street into the picture for the first
time," he said. "I want to make sure that Wall Street
brokerages aren't lulled into a false sense of confidence
about the degree of risk."
   Since its founding in 1986, Professional Coin and its
nationwide network of participating dealers have been telling
investors that the company grades coins with consistency so
they can be bought and sold "sight unseen" as confidently as
any other commodity.
   Critics, from the start, have warned of potential
conflicts of interest with Professional Coin, because it is
owned and run by dealers who buy and sell coins. These
critics say the temptation is too great to grade a favored
customer's coins higher than they should be.
   Professional Coin's avowed "anti-bias" policy is a key
part of the FTC complaint. In its lawsuit, the agency accuses
Professional Coin of not living up to its claim that it takes
"all feasible steps to insure that no one involved in the
grading process ever knows the identity of the coin's owner."
But the FTC complaint doesn't spell out any alleged
improprieties, such as favoritism to dealers or customers.
   The FTC has been investigating coin-grading services as
part of a crackdown on coin fraud. Last year, the agency
obtained a consent decree from another large independent
grader, Numismatic Certification Institute, and its parent,
Heritage Capital Corp. of Dallas. The FTC said the grader,
among other things, misled customers about its grading
standards.
   The action against Professional Coin could be a boost for
its chief rival, Numismatic Guaranty Corp. of America, which
is based in Parsippany, N.J., and run by John Albanese, a
Professional Coin founder who left that organization soon
after its launch. Some dealers have boycotted Numismatic
Guaranty, complaining that its standards are too high, so the
coins it grades can't be sold for as much.
   Another major grading service is run by the American
Numismatic Association, a trade group for dealers and
collectors.
   Merrill Lynch's NFA World Coin Fund already has bought
some Professional Coin-graded coins for its portfolio, said
Frank J. Carr, the fund's chief financial officer. He said
Merrill Lynch trusts Professional Coin. "Unless there's some
revelation" about the service, he said the fund doesn't
believe it has to make any changes in its prospectus or the
fund's operations. "We have no reason to believe there will
be any problem," he said.
   Last year, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. led Wall Street's move
into the coin business by marketing a $40 million American
Rare Coin Fund limited partnership. Kidder, a unit of General
Electric Co., also pointed to the success of Professional
Coin and other grading services. A Kidder spokeswoman said,
"Any problems that may arise with PCGS should not affect the
intrinsic value of the coins themselves."
   The FTC has complained about widespread abuse by dealers
of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s index of 20 rare-coin prices. The
index of 20 very-rare and valuable silver coins shows a
whopping 17.3% compound annual rate of return over the past
two decades, much better than stocks or bonds. But this
doesn't necessarily reflect the performance of the coin
market as a whole, the FTC has warned.
   "Using the Salomon Brothers index as comparison for the
coins that most consumers use for investment is a little like
using their art index, which may reflect the price of van
Goghs, and assuming it will be the same for Dali prints," the
FTC's Mr. Cutler said.
