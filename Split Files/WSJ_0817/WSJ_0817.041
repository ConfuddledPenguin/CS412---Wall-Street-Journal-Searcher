   AMSTERDAM -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported that net
income for its first quarter ended June 30 plunged 82% to
41.4 million guilders ($23.5 million), or 0.78 guilder a
share, from 230.1 million guilders, or 4.36 guilders a share,
a year earlier, when results reflected a big gain.
   The Dutch flag carrier said fiscal first-quarter profit
from its normal operations before taxes and extraordinary
gains fell 74% to 27.8 million guilders from 105.1 million
guilders a year earlier, citing foreign currency swings and
lower exchange rates.

   Extraordinary gains accounted for 13.6 million guilders of
profit, compared with 125 million guilders in the
year-earlier quarter, reflecting proceeds from a divestiture.
   KLM blamed the weakness of the dollar and the Japanese yen
for eroding traffic revenue. Though its total airline traffic
for the fiscal first quarter increased 6% from a year
earlier, traffic revenue rose only 2%.
   Earlier this month, the carrier warned that margins would
be under pressure during fiscal 1991, for which it declined
to give any earnings forecast.
