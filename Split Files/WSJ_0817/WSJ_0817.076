   NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos. moved closer to its planned
$3.8 billion acquisition of Swiss chocolate and coffee
company Jacobs Suchard AG, and appointed the architect of a
turnaround at its Maxwell House Coffee Co. to run the
European company.
   The U.S. tobacco and consumer products company said it
completed its acquisition of Colima Holding AG, a closely
held company that controls 62% of the voting rights of
Suchard. Through Colima, Philip Morris is making a tender
offer for the balance of Suchard's shares outstanding.

   At the same time, the Suchard board named Raymond Viault
as chief executive officer of Jacobs Suchard, which is now an
operating unit of Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods
subsidiary.
   Mr. Viault, 46 years old, had previously served as
president of Kraft General Foods' Maxwell House Coffee Co.
While at Maxwell House, which accounts for 22.2% of Kraft
General Foods' U.S. business, Mr. Viault helped engineer a
turnaround of the unit's lagging domestic coffee business.
   By boosting the quality of the beans used in its Maxwell
House brand, and by rolling out such new products as Maxwell
House Rich French Roast, Maxwell House Colombian Supreme and
Maxwell House 1882, the company saw its market share begin to
climb in the past year. Together, its brands now account for
about 34.6% of the domestic coffee market, making Maxwell
House the nation's largest coffee manufacturer.
   At Suchard, Mr. Viault will oversee a trove of brands that
includes the Jacobs Cafe, and Night and Day coffees, and the
Toblerone and Milka brands of chocolate. When Philip Morris
announced the acquisition in June, it said it hoped Suchard
would allow it to build Pan-European brands.
   To succeed Mr. Viault, Kraft General Foods named Charles
Phillips as president of Maxwell House. Mr. Phillips, 45, has
spent his entire career at General Foods, climbing through
financial and marketing positions at Maxwell House and other
Kraft General Foods' units. Most recently, he served as Kraft
General Foods' president for Latin America, Eastern Europe,
the Middle East and Africa.
   To maintain Maxwell House's momentum in the U.S. market,
Mr. Phillips vows to step up the company's new product
initiatives. He said the company is already testing a
liquid-coffee concentrate and a fully prepared liquid coffee,
each designed to be heated in microwave ovens. The company is
also testing both canned and bottled versions of an
iced-coffee product called Cappio.
   Industry experts say further gains in the U.S. coffee
business may be difficult, however. Consumption of coffee in
the U.S. has dropped for more than a decade, as younger
consumers have turned to sweet drinks for their morning
beverage.
   But Mr. Phillips maintains Maxwell House's new initiatives
will lure back soda drinkers. "We just have to find new ways
to deliver the benefits of coffee to young people," Mr.
Phillips said. "We've given that market away without a
fight."
