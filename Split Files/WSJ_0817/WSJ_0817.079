   TOKYO -- Lawsuits filed by the American victims of a rare
blood disorder have cast a new shadow over Japan's
third-largest chemical producer.
   Showa Denko K.K. confirmed last week that a total of 89
suits have been filed against it in the U.S. by victims of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS, a blood disorder that
causes severe muscle pain, neurological damage and, in some
cases, death.

   In addition to hurting the company's financial prospects,
the claims have undermined Showa Denko's struggle to shed the
reputation for arrogance and social irresponsibility it
earned in losing a 1971 pollution suit in Japan.
   A record number of cases of EMS were reported in the U.S.
last year, and American researchers now believe that Showa
Denko is to blame. Two studies, one published last month in
the Journal of the American Medical Association and a second
in last week's New England Journal of Medicine, linked the
crippling disorder to allegedly contaminated batches of
L-tryptophan, an amino acid produced by Showa Denko in the
first three months of 1989.
   Claims against the company and its U.S. subsidiary, Showa
Denko America Inc., total $810 million so far, company
officials say. But that amount may balloon if the more than
1,400 other Americans who contracted the blood disorder after
using products made from Showa Denko's amino acids also seek
compensation. Showa Denko is contesting the suits.
   Senior management at corporate headquarters in Tokyo
declined requests to be interviewed. A spokesman denied that
the company was negligent, insisting that it is dealing
responsibly with the situation. "We are cooperating fully
with health officials in the U.S. and Japan to determine the
origins of the disorder," he said.
   Showa Denko officials confirm that 1,535 people who took
dietary supplements containing L-tryptophan manufactured by
the company later showed symptoms of the blood disease. To
date, 27 people have died. (Only two L-tryptophan-related
cases of EMS have been reported in Japan, but dietary
supplements in pill form aren't popular among Japanese
consumers.)
   But the company says the statistical correlation between
ingestion of its amino acids and contraction of EMS doesn't
prove conclusively that they caused the disease.
"Ninety-seven percent isn't the same as 100%," says Robert
Schwadron, a spokesman for Showa Denko America. He says an
animal model is needed to demonstrate a causal relationship.
   In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare banned the sale of
L-tryptophan. Showa Denko voluntarily suspended the
manufacture and export of the substance last November as soon
as medical reports suggested that it might be related to the
disorder.
   It could be years before claims against Showa Denko are
settled in U.S. courts, but analysts here agree that the
burden of compensating EMS victims could devastate the
company financially. In the year ended last December, Showa
Denko reported sales of 526 billion yen ($3.5 billion),
recurring profits of 33.5 billion yen ($223 million) and
liquid assets of about 50 billion yen ($333 million).
   "The arithmetic is pretty simple," says Colin Talcroft, an
analyst who follows the chemical industry for Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd. A liability judgment
greater than 100 billion yen probably wouldn't force Showa
Denko into bankruptcy, Mr. Talcroft says, but it would "wipe
out liquid assets and put the company in a very, very
difficult position."
   Some analysts think the company's legal battles in the
U.S. may force it to cancel or postpone indefinitely plans to
construct a mammoth, 100 billion yen ethylene plant in
southern Japan.
   As if those troubles weren't enough, Iraq's surprise
invasion of Kuwait has severed Showa Denko from its major
supplier of naptha, the raw material most important to the
company's manufacturing operations. Showa Denko depended on
Kuwait for 30% of its naptha, and Tommy Tang, an analyst with
Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., estimates that the cost of
finding new sources will reduce the company's 1990 profits by
at least 3 billion yen.
   Showa Denko got its start in 1939 as a processor of animal
fertilizer in rural Kyushu in southern Japan. After World War
II, the company prospered under the leadership of its
hard-driving founder, Haruo Suzuki, diversifying into
manufacturing petrochemical and aluminum products in the
mid-1960s.
   Petrochemicals such as ethylene and polystyrene account
for 46% of Showa Denko sales, while inorganic materials such
as ceramics and aluminum account for 36%. About 10 years ago,
Showa Denko, like Japan's other big chemical makers, began
diversifying into biotechnology products with higher profit
margins, such as L-tryptophan. Still, L-tryptophan has never
accounted for more than 1% of the company's revenues.
   Oddly, Showa Denko's legal problems in the U.S. haven't
had much effect on the company's stock price in Japan. Though
the stock is down about 40% from its price just before first
American studies linking EMS with L-tryptophan, the Japanese
chemical industry as a whole is also down almost 40%.
   The earlier pollution suit against the company was filed
in 1967 by 77 residents of Niigata City on Japan's western
coast. They charged that a Showa Denko chemical plant had
dumped mercury into a river that passes through the town,
causing excruciatingly painful bone and nervous system
disorders among residents who had eaten fish from the river.
   Showa Denko executives openly defied efforts by the
Ministry of Health and Welfare to investigate the case.
Shortly after the suit was filed, Showa Denko's president
declared on national television that his company wouldn't
accept the conclusions of the government's investigation no
matter what its outcome was, and that it planned to disregard
any government orders to modify its manufacturing operations.
   To hinder progress of the investigation, Showa Denko
officials swiftly dismantled the entire plant, and ordered
the destruction of company documents with details of its
manufacturing processes. They also destroyed waste water
samples taken from the site.
   The cover-up attempt backfired. In a landmark decision
handed down in 1971, the Niigata District Court ruled against
Showa Denko, arguing that the company had deprived itself of
the only evidence that might have absolved it of blame. The
judgment set an important legal precedent in Japan, and
opened the door for a host of similar suits against other big
polluters.
