   LONDON -- Royal Insurance Holdings PLC reported a pretax
loss of #65 million ($123.5 million) for the first half,
attributed to heavy weather-related claims. A year earlier,
the company had profit of #119 million.
   The loss was wider than market forecasts, which were #40
million to #60 million.

   Despite the loss, the large British insurance group said
it would pay an improved interim dividend of 11.25 pence, up
5% from 10.75 pence a year ago.
   The company said that after taxes, less minority
interests, or profit attributable to shareholders, it had a
loss of #46 million, or 9.5 pence a share, compared with
profit of #83 million, or 17.2 pence a share, a year earlier.
   Premium income rose 4%, to #2.49 billion from #2.40
billion.
   Ian Rushton, group chief executive, said the results
"remain dominated by the abnormally high level of world-wide
weather losses." Royal, like most British insurers, suffered
from claims related to wind storms which swept Europe in
January and February, as well as damage from an Australian
flood. He said weather losses totaled #169 million compared
with #47 million a year ago.
   Royal Insurance's U.K. operations reported a pretax loss
of #39 million from a #94 million profit a year ago. The
result was helped by pretax profit of #23 million in the
second quarter.
   The group's U.S. operations continued to show a decline,
bringing a pretax loss of #52 million in the second quarter,
more than double the #25 million loss a year earlier.
   Royal Insurance said the U.S. result "reflects the
industrywide problem" of inadequate insurance costs and
"escalating" costs of losses. Royal Insurance plans to
retreat from unprofitable markets and dispose of noncore
operations to counter the U.S. problems, the company said.
   The company's world-wide operations, which include
Continental Europe and Australia, had a pretax loss of #10
million.
   One analyst said that the size of the company's losses in
the first half means it may make a small pretax loss for the
year. Originally, he had forecast a pretax profit of #34
million for 1990.
