   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court here called off
the election for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors until the court reaches a decision on a Hispanic
voting rights suit in the nation's most populous county.
   By a 2-1 vote, the appeals panel stayed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge David V. Kenyon ordering a special primary
election using the new district lines, which are designed to
help elect a Hispanic to the county's five-member governing
board. Judge Kenyon ruled in June that the county
discriminated against Hispanics when redrawing district
boundaries after the 1980 census. On Aug. 3, the judge
rejected a redistricting plan drawn up by the county board
and then accepted one developed by civil-rights groups.

   Both sides were frustrated with the latest decision.
Attorneys for Los Angeles County had argued that a November
runoff election from a June primary in the old district
boundaries should be allowed to go ahead until the appeal was
decided. A Hispanic group and the American Civil Liberties
Union wanted a new election to be held based on the map
accepted by Judge Kenyon.
   "Neither side has demonstrated that the equities strongly
favor going forward with their chosen election on November
6," wrote the appeals court judges. A full hearing is
scheduled for Oct. 1.
