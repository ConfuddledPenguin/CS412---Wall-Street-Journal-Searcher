   A man from Cornell University phoned to say that his
school was planning to commemorate the anniversary of an
athletically significant event, and while I don't usually
bite for such things this one seemed worthy of note. Come
this fall, 50 years will have passed since the famous "Fifth
Down Game" between the football teams from Cornell and
Dartmouth.
   In case your memory needs jogging about that Nov. 16,
1940, contest -- mine did; I was only two years old at the
time -- here are the salient facts. Cornell, undefeated and a
contender for the nation's No. 1 ranking, trailed a
determined Dartmouth squad, 3-0, in the fourth quarter at
Darmouth's Hanover, N.H., stadium. As the clock ticked toward
zero, Cornell mounted a drive, gaining a first down on the
Dartmouth six-yard line. Three running plays netted five
yards. With 10 seconds left Cornell called time out, but that
would have exceeded its allotment of those and it was
penalized five yards. A pass into the end zone fell
incomplete.

   That should have been that, but it wasn't. Referee William
"Red" Friesell ruled Cornell had another down coming. The Big
Red used it to pass for a touchdown as the gun sounded, and
the extra point made the score 7-3. There was some confusion
afterward about what had happened, but everyone went home
believing Cornell had won.
   The next Monday, though, Cornell coaches and officials
reviewed films of the game, and confirmed that the touchdown
shouldn't have counted. They so informed Friesell, who, upon
reflection, admitted his error. After consulting the Big Red
team, and hearing some understandable grumbling (one Cornell
player noted that game officials' mistakes in Dartmouth's
favor weren't being corrected), Cornell offered to concede
the game. Dartmouth accepted, and it went into the book,
forevermore, as a 3-0 Dartmouth win.
   Cornell long has basked in the glory of that decision, and
rightfully. I think it is no simple-minded yearning for some
elusive "good old" day to observe that the cause of justice
in sports never has been better served.
   This conclusion has been inescapable these past few weeks,
which I have spent, more or less, on vacation. From high
places and low has come evidence that the people who
administer the present-day world of sportsbiz are not keeping
their eyes on the ball, if they ever had them there to begin
with.
   Exhibit A came from a reader who passed along newspaper
clippings detailing the travail of Michael Hanner, a
nine-year-old Little League baseball player from Kirkland,
Wash. Michael, a pitcher, was happily playing on a team with
his friends, but with a few games left in the season was
"drafted" by a club in a higher division. When he balked at
the switch, the league (i.e, its adult overseers) said he
couldn't play at all.
   Michael's parents got a lawyer who, eventually, persuaded
a judge to allow the lad to finish the season with his
original team. But the league insisted that its pro-style
drafting rules were proper and would be enforced against
future recalcitrant nine-year-olds.
   Moving up a bit in the adults-vs.-kids department, we come
to the NCAA, whose judgments rarely fail to puzzle. The
outfit that makes college sports' rules is being sued by
Braxton Banks, a Notre Dame student-fullback, who entered his
name in the last National Football League draft but wasn't
picked. He wants to play for the Irish again this fall, but
the NCAA, claiming that his action violated its requirement
that players be amateurs, says he can't.
   A couple of points are obvious here, but ought to be made
anyway. One is that the only amateurs in the sizable cast
that stages college football are the boys in pads. The other
is that unless ND is paying Banks, nobody is, and he's still
simonpure.
   It further should be said that the real, and perhaps sole,
beneficiaries of this NCAA policy are the NFL and
pro-basketball teams, which can bargain with the
college-eligible players they do select without having to
worry that the young men might choose to go back to school
instead. It's bad enough that the colleges are grid and hoops
farm teams without their also helping the pros hold down
their payrolls.
   Curiouser yet was the recent NCAA ruling to extend a
probation against Clemson, but to apply no new penalties, as
a result of evidence that coaches at the school dispensed
steroids to athletes. Three former Clemson assistant football
coaches have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in this
matter. The NCAA leaps to punish schools that give athletes
things, like T-shirts, rides in coaches' cars or the
occasional odd dollar. It apparently sees less wrong with
exposing them to the physical and psychological horrors tied
to steroid use.
   Finally, we come to "l'affaire" Steinbrenner, which has
occupied much of the press for much of the last few months.
Seems that George, Major League baseball's Tyrannosaurus Rex,
paid one Howard Spira, usually described as a former gambler,
to produce some dirt on Dave Winfield, a former Steinbrenner
baseball employee with whom The Boss has had an inexplicable
but long-running feud. For this, Commissioner Fay Vincent
ordered that Steinbrenner be severed from the management of
the ballclub, usually called the New York Yankees, while
being allowed to retain his majority ownership interest.
   One need not be a pal of George's to note that the
decision raised more questions than a week of "Jeopardy." Was
The Boss punished for his deed, or for having contact with
Spira? If it's the latter, how come Winfield, who'd also had
dealings with the guy, isn't getting socked, too? Why did a
federal grand jury look at the Steinbrenner-Spira
transactions and indict Spira for extortion?
   And if George is supposed to keep his mitts off the Yanks,
why did Vincent say it would be okay for him to pick his
successor, including his son, Hank? That could still occur
even though another fella has been named for now. If Dad,
over dinner, wanted to express an opinion on, say, the worth
of the team's field manager, was Sonny expected to turn a
deaf ear?
   Say it isn't so, Fay]

   Friday's Leisure &amp; Arts page column by Frederick C. Klein
incorrectly identified a school on NCAA probation. It is the
University of South Carolina, not Clemson.
