   NEW YORK -- Investors pummeled stocks and bonds, alarmed
by rising Mideast tensions and more signs that the U.S.
economy is sinking into a recession combined with high
inflation.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 66.83 points to
close at 2681.44 on light volume. The decline was the
sharpest since Aug. 6, when the Dow lost 93.31 points.
Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell 1 5/8 points, or
$16.25 for each $1,000 of face amount, in hectic trading.

   New economic reports showing rising consumer prices and
sinking housing starts pushed the dollar down to a new
postWorld War II low against the German mark. That bad news
was compounded by remarks from Iraq renewing its call for a
holy war against the U.S and dashing hopes for a quick
diplomatic solution to the Mideast standoff.
   The bloodletting in the stock market was broad; none of
the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial average gained.
   Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First
Securities, said a 25-point drop in the Dow in the final half
hour of trading reflected broad selling by institutional
investors. "A lot of it was by pension funds -- just a
general bailing out of this market," he said. Coming into
yesterday, "a lot of people were expecting some kind of
bounce," he said.
   Even before stocks opened for trading, the bond market was
hit by news that the July consumer price index rose 0.4% --
more sharply than expected -- even with a decline in energy
prices. Then came the report that July housing starts fell
sharply, when they were expected to be flat with the June
level. Finally, the news wires were sizzling with indications
that the Mideast tinderbox once again was edging toward the
kindling point.
   The CPI report, combined with the decline in housing
starts, raises the specter of stagflation, that deadly
combination of rising prices and a shrinking economy, said
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
   "The reaction in the financial community was
understandably terrible," Mr. Straszheim said. "People are
getting a whiff of stagflation and see the Federal Reserve in
an even tighter box." The Fed has declared itself first and
foremost an inflation fighter, but at the same it is coming
under enormous pressure to ease interest rates in order to
stimulate an economy slipping into recession.
   In Mr. Straszheim's view, inflation is now practically out
of the Fed's control. "It will take a good garden-variety
recession or worse to get inflation down," he said -- one in
which consumer demand weakens so much that higher prices
simply don't hold.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 138.9 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues swamped
advancers, 1,300 to 330.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.92%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5525 German marks and 147.25 Japanese yen,
compared with 1.5660 marks and 147.65 yen Wednesday.
