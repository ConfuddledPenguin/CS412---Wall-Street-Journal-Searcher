   James River Corp. said it will sell or shut down
operations with annual sales of $1.3 billion, nearly a fourth
of the paper company's revenue, after other efforts "failed"
to improve financial performance.
   In connection with the restructuring, the Richmond, Va.,
company will post a charge against earnings of $140 million
to $150 million, or $1.71 to $1.84 a share, which analysts
say will result in a loss of more than $1 a share for the
first quarter, ended July 29. In the year-earlier period, the
company earned $57 million, or 64 cents a share.

   James River said it will use the proceeds of the sales to
reduce debt and buy back as many as 8 million shares. The
company also intends to make major capital investments in its
remaining businesses to better compete with the larger, more
efficient machines of such competitors as Scott Paper Co. and
Fort Howard Corp.
   Analysts said that the moves are a solid first step in
improving shareholder value. "Long term, I think this is very
positive for earnings, financial returns and the stock
price," said Jeanne Carroll of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   The company has made small moves to focus on its more
profitable businesses over the last year. But Brenton S.
Halsey, chairman and chief executive officer, told
stockholders at the annual meeting yesterday in Richmond that
more radical change was necessary. "Our team has been unable
to find a satisfactory approach to getting back on track --
other than changing the structure of our business," Mr.
Halsey said in prepared remarks.
   Mr. Halsey said the company needs to boost its return on
equity to 16%, from the 10% range where it has hovered for
the last five years.
   The restructuring plan, to be implemented over one year,
could well move James River toward that goal, analysts said.
But James River still has a long way to go to match the
efficiency of its competitors. "Even after they sell these
assets, the company doesn't have the best mills," said George
Adler of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "They still need to
spend money to upgrade them."
   Indeed, James River said it will spend $97 million to
double the capacity of paperboard machines at Kalamazoo,
Mich., and an undisclosed amount on 12 other major projects.
   But Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said the new expenses and
stock buy-back could affect James River's ability to repay
about $750 million of the company's $1.77 billion in
long-term debt. S&amp;P warned that it may downgrade its ratings
on the company's debt, though Moody's Investors Service Inc.
confirmed its current ratings.
   Much depends on the price fetched by the business on the
block; the paper industry is in a cyclical slump, and it is
unclear how much James River could get. The planned
divestitures involve 28 mills.
   James River noted that it has already made progress on the
asset sales, which will affect about 7,300 employees out of a
total of 37,000. The company said it signed a letter of
intent to sell 80% of the Specialty Industrial Papers unit,
with about $600 million in sales, to a new company controlled
by AEA Investors Inc. and a management group headed by James
E. Rogers, the group executive who currently runs the
division. The company said it also signed a letter of intent
to sell its West Linn, Ore., mill, which makes coated paper,
to Simpson Paper Co.
   The company will then be able to focus its money and
attention on four core businesses: towels and tissues, Dixie
food-service products, food and consumer packaging, and paper
used in printing and publishing.
   James River announced the restructuring after the stock
market closed yesterday. In composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, the company's shares closed at $22.875, down
25 cents.
