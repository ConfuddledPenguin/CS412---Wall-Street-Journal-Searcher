   LONDON -- Britain's economic slowdown has had an uneven
effect: Using the usual yardsticks, the once-booming
southeast and the West Midlands already are in recession,
while other parts of the U.K. expect some continued growth.
   The patchwork pattern emerged from a regional study by the
Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies
Ltd. Based on a survey of manufacturers throughout the U.K.,
the two organizations found that the government's policy of
high interest rates has had divergent effects on investment
plans, output expectations and export orders.

   The pattern stands in contrast to the one-time north-south
divide, in which northern Britain chronically trailed the
more prosperous south. So far at least, northern England,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland seem to have staved off the
most damaging effects of the economic downturn.
   London and the southeast have been dragged down faster
than the rest of the U.K. Business optimism there has fallen
further than in any other region. Manufacturers in the area
also reported the lowest level of capacity utilization in the
U.K. Although the southeast is also home to many service
companies, such concerns often depend on business from
traditional industries and have suffered with the slump in
manufacturing.
   Consumers in the southeast have saved less and borrowed
more than their counterparts in the north, CBI economists
said. As a result, the last year of interest-rate increases
has hit them harder.
   Costs of materials and parts have risen, but weakening
demand has made it difficult to increase prices of finished
manufactured goods. As a result, manufacturers in the
southeast reported that their profit margins have been
squeezed.
   The West Midlands, where the U.K.'s auto industry is
concentrated, showed the gloomiest prospects for expanded
output. Sluggish demand for automobiles hit not only car
producers but metal companies and engineering concerns that
serve the industry. Companies in the region expect falling
output and rising unemployment in the next four months.
Unsurprisingly, capital investment in the region has
slackened and is expected to fall off further, according to
the survey.
   Economic optimism was relatively strong in the province of
Northern Ireland, despite the chronic sectarian conflict
there. The survey showed that exports have been growing and
output has expanded. The level of planned investment in
plants and machinery in Northern Ireland is higher than in
any other region in the U.K.
   Companies surveyed in Scotland have been hurt by weak
demand at home, but they reported relatively healthy levels
of export orders. In recent months, manufacturing output in
Scotland has risen, and the number of firms operating below
full capacity has fallen.
   Though they were affected in varying degrees, firms in all
the regions said they have been pinched by the currently high
interest rates. In an effort to wring inflation out of the
economy, the Thatcher government has increased base interest
rates to 15%, which has tipped dozens of small and
medium-sized companies into bankruptcy and weakened consumer
demand. Two other developments are likely to make things
worse for U.K. manufacturers: increases in oil prices arising
from the Middle East crisis and the continued strength of the
pound, which is cutting into export orders by making British
goods more costly overseas. Economists expect that interest
rates will be reduced sometime after the pound becomes a full
participant in the European Monetary System, which links the
participating currencies in set bands of fluctuation. The
U.K. is expected to join the arrangement sometime in the next
five or six months.
