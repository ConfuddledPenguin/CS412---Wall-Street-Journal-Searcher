   WASHINGTON -- The government released new evidence that
the U.S. economy was already deeply troubled by inflation and
a deteriorating construction sector before the Middle East
crisis sent the price of oil soaring.
   Consumer prices rose 0.4% in July, a month in which energy
prices were falling, the Labor Department said. Over the
first seven months of the year, the department said, consumer
prices have been rising at a 5.8% annual rate.

   With the inflation rate already approaching 6% this year,
some analysts believe the oil-price jump in the aftermath of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month could push it
toward 7%. And even if a weak economy keeps price rises more
moderate than that, 1990 now seems certain to produce the
highest inflation rate in nine years.
   Also during July, housing starts fell for the sixth
straight month, dropping 2.6% to an annual rate of 1.14
million, their lowest level since September 1982, during the
last recession, the Commerce Department reported.
   The new reports underscore the extreme difficulty of the
dilemma that will face the Federal Reserve's policy committee
at its meeting next week. The central bank is under pressure
from the Bush administration to cushion the economy by
lowering interest rates. But the new figures suggest that
while the economy seems weak enough to need a jump-start,
inflation pressures persist even apart from the oil jolt.
   "They are faced with an impossible and some sense
paralyzing set of factors," said Neal Soss, chief economist
at First Boston Corp. in New York.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 oil prices shot up, and
economists and government officials worried that the shock
could plunge the already lethargic U.S. economy into a
recession.
   For the past five quarters the economy has grown at an
annual rate of less than 2%, due largely to the Federal
Reserve's efforts to curb inflation by keeping interest rates
high.
   A report last week that producer prices fell in July
helped bolster the view that Fed policy makers would feel
comfortable allowing interest rates to fall, given evidence
that inflation, apart from energy prices, was under control.
   But yesterday's consumer price report said that energy
prices dropped 0.7% in July and that, excluding them,
consumer prices rose 0.5%. Excluding both energy and food --
which economists often do because of frequent price swings in
those categories -- consumer prices rose 0.6% last month. In
June, prices rose 0.6% excluding energy and 0.4% excluding
energy and food.
   The numbers unnerved some traders in the financial
markets, helping to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average
down 66.83 yesterday.
   Joel Popkin, an inflation expert who heads an economic
forecasting firm in Washington, said the latest reading of
the consumer price index, the most widely watched gauge of
inflation, shows that the Fed's policy of fighting inflation
by keeping economic activity slow but growing hasn't worked.
   But he also warned that the consequences of a recession
could be very grave.
   "If we were to enter a recession right now, the economy is
more vulnerable than at any time I can remember in the 35
years I've been watching the U.S. economy," he said, citing
the country's huge budget and trade deficits, the cost of
bailing out the S&amp;L industry and the high debt levels of many
American corporations.
   "My view is if we entered a recession, there is no basis
that economists have to predict how long or how deep that
recession would be."
   Whether the economy sinks into recession could depend not
only on the Fed but also on whether consumers and businesses
react to higher oil prices by curbing spending in other
areas.
   Mr. Popkin estimates that "every $1 increase in a barrel
of oil drains $6.2 billion at an annual rate from the
purchasing power of people who buy energy." And, he adds,
"half of that leaves the country, if our oil is imported."
   Though energy prices are sure to boost the next round of
inflation figures, there has been little evidence so far that
businesses are planning to pass increases in their energy
costs through to their customers.
   "We are going to see large energy-price increases next
month," said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers
Hanover Securities Corp. "Then, depending how long that level
is sustained, that will start to feed through into other
goods -- plastics, all things that use petrochemicals."
   Rises in the prices of tobacco and a category that mostly
includes hotel and motel bills accounted for a considerable
portion of the overall rise in the July consumer price index.
Medical costs continued to soar, jumping 0.9% after a 0.7%
rise in June. Entertainment costs climbed 0.6% following
June's 0.2% rise. Food prices grew 0.4% after a 0.7% increase
in June. Housing costs, a category that includes energy,
maintenance and other renters' and homeowners' costs, rose
0.5% on top of a 0.6% increase in June.
   The Commerce Department said every region of the country
but the West saw a decline in new housing construction in
July. Overall, work began on single-family homes, the core of
the housing market, at an annual rate of 873,000, down 1.4%
from June. The number of building permits issued during the
month dropped 2.6%, to a 1.07 million annual rate.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the
average weekly earnings of American workers grew 0.3% in July
after taking inflation into account. In June they rose 0.2%.
   The figures in all the reports were adjusted for seasonal
variations.
