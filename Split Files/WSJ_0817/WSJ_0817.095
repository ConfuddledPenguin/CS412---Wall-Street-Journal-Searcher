   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 525 money market
funds rose $2.39 billion to $404.48 billion, in the week
ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 252 general purpose funds rose $469.9 million to
$140.04 billion and assets of 104 broker-dealer funds rose
$1.09 billion to $163.32 billion. Assets of 169 institutional
funds rose $829.3 million to $101.11 billion.

   Assets of money-market funds rose for the seventh
consecutive week as investors leaned toward shorter-term
instruments. "Despite a slight easing of yields offered by
money-market funds, events in the Persian Gulf have enhanced
their attraction as safe and liquid investment vehicles,"
said Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at
the institute.
   Mutual-fund assets were revised for the week ended Aug. 8,
to $402.09 billion, with a revised increase of $6.18 billion.
