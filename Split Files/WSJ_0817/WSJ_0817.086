   NEW YORK -- Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. said it closed
offices in Zurich, Geneva and Stockholm as part of the bank's
previously announced world-wide restructuring.
   The move comes as other big U.S. banks are reducing their
presence in Europe because of the high costs of doing
business there and intense competition. In recent years
foreign banks have become more skilled at performing many of
the corporate and investment services that U.S. banks had
built their European businesses around. At the same time,
most major U.S. banks have turned more of their attention to
serving the domestic market, where competition from foreign
banks isn't as stiff.

   James Brokken, Manufacturers group vice president for
Europe, said the bank's restructuring in Europe is designed
to emphasize Manufacturers's investment banking expertise and
reduce the bank's commercial banking operations. He said that
Manufacturers already has reduced its presence in such
countries as Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece. But at the same
time the bank is expanding operations in Turkey, Portugal,
Spain and Norway.
   "We've done a good job of narrowing the focus in Europe,"
he said. "I don't believe we're perfect, and we're not
earning what I want to, but we're not a big problem for the
bank."
   Mr. Brokken said Manufacturers has been scaling down its
Swiss operations for some time and finally concluded that it
could best serve Swiss clients from outside Switzerland.
   "If you look at what we can do for our clients in
Switzerland, it's not in Switzerland. It's pan-European,
first-class risk management in currencies and interest rates
and we can deliver that in a much more professional way in
London."
   The decision to withdraw from Sweden was also based on
servicing clients from other locations as well as the return
on the bank's investment there, said Mr. Brokken. "At the end
of the day, in a world in which you have to be careful about
every penny you spend, it wasn't worth the effort." He added
that Manufacturers will maintain small representative offices
in Switzerland and Sweden.
   Manufacturers Hanover, a unit of Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., hasn't been the only U.S. bank to pull back in Europe.
In the past few years, Chase Manhattan Bank sold a Dutch bank
with $5 billion in assets to France's Credit Lyonnais, and
Bank America Corp. sold its Italian bank to West Germany's
Deutsche Bank AG. U.S. banks have also been unloading
operations in Asia.
   Some European bankers are puzzled by the U.S. banks'
retreat from abroad. They have contended that U.S. banks are
surrendering markets and relationships that took years to
establish and won't be easily built up again in the future.
Foreign bankers also argue that such sales decrease the
competitive position of U.S. banks globally.
   U.S. bankers, on the other hand, retort that profitability
is more important than maintaining costly overseas
operations.
