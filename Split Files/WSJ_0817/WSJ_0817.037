   CLEVELAND -- Ameritrust Corp. said it will slash 780 jobs,
or 11.5% of its work force, in an effort to offset loan
losses resulting from an overly aggressive growth strategy.
   As a result of the retrenchment, Ameritrust said it will
record a third-quarter charge of between $14 million and $18
million. However, the bank holding company expects the charge
will be offset by reduced operating expenses and gains from
extraordinary transactions, such as asset sales. In the
year-ago third quarter, Ameritrust earned $30 million, or 70
cents a share.

   Ameritrust, which had a loss of $33.2 million in the first
half of 1990, said the cutbacks will help trim expenses by
10%, or $32 million, by 1992. About 60% of the 780 jobs will
be actual cuts as the company reduces or eliminates
divisions, while the remaining 40% will come from attrition
and the reduction in temporary employees.
   While the company offered few specifics about which
departments would be affected, it said it would
"de-emphasize" the area involved with highly leveraged
transactions, such as buy-outs or acquisitions.
   That is where Ameritrust got in trouble, analysts said, as
the company aggressively built its loan portfolio around the
go-go merger and acquisition activity of the 1980s. It ended
1989 with $892 million in highly leveraged loans, or 11% of
total loans outstanding. The bank's nonperforming assets shot
up to $262.4 million for the second quarter from $157.4
million at the end of the year-ago quarter.
   But the highly leveraged transactions, as well as other
commercial real estate loans, soured. Earlier this year
federal examiners reviewed the company's loan portfolio and
-- applying tougher regulations -- forced it to significantly
increase its loan-loss provisions. The company's loan-loss
reserves totaled $153.4 million in June compared with $21.5
million a year earlier.
   As a result, wary investors have backed off, with the
share price falling more than 50% from its 52-week high of
$29. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Ameritrust closed
at $14, off 62.5 cents.
   The bank, with $10.8 billion in assets, now says it's
going to focus on more conservative consumer banking, trust
and investment management and corporate banking, with an
emphasis on small and medium-sized Midwestern businesses.
   Henry C. Dickson, an analyst at McDonald &amp; Co., Cleveland,
said Ameritrust's problems festered for a number of years,
but that the bank hasn't made cuts on this scale in his
memory.
   "They were in businesses that weren't that profitable," he
said. "Because there's a lot of excess capacity in the
industry now, you have to be more realistic about how you're
going to make money." Last year Ameritrust, Ohio's fifth
largest bank, earned $116 million, or $3.11 a share.
