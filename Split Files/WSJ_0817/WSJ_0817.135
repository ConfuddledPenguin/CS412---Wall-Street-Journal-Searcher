   With some justification, the scientific community laments
that U.S. basic research grants haven't kept pace with the
state of inquiry, such that whereas 20 years ago most
applications were accepted, nowadays less than a fifth are
funded. Before you think that science has no political
constituency, consider the success of senator Mark Hatfield
(R., Ore.) in using his powerful Appropriations Committee
seat to rack up construction money for the Oregon Health
Sciences University. With the latest $12.5 million catch for
a Neurosensory Research Center this month, the Oregonian
newspaper reports, Mr. Hatfield has now funneled $91 million
into bricks and mortar for the 1,300-student school over the
last decade -- more than for any other campus in the country.
Scientists might well conclude that Congress's main interest
is not really research, but ribbon cuttings.
