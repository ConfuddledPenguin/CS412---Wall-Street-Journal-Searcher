   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. will extend to Austria nearly the
same privileges in high-technology trade that it gives its
European and Pacific allies, the Commerce Department said.
   The department granted Austria the new status after being
assured that the country is satisfactorily enforcing export
controls established by its revised foreign trade law. Until
now, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and Singapore have been the
only neutral countries enjoying most of the export-licensing
benefits that the U.S. normally accords its allies.

   The U.S. move will allow U.S. vendors to ship
higher-quality computers and other electronics products to
Austria without a license. U.S. exporters also will be
allowed to ship large numbers of even higher-level computers
under single distribution licenses. Austria, moreover, will
gain the right to import the most advanced U.S. mainframes
without licensing paperwork, provided the equipment is bought
by state-controlled enterprises and will remain on the
enterprises' own premises.
   Austrian diplomats welcomed the U.S. action, asserting
that the new trade privileges will enhance Vienna's effort to
attract U.S. companies interested in establishing European
regional headquarters with sophisticated computer
capabilities.
   The U.S. granted Austria somewhat lesser benefits in 1987,
shortly after Vienna began requiring export permits for
certain strategic goods that previously had crossed its
borders freely. But the U.S. said at the time that it would
withhold other benefits until it was satisfied that Austria's
busy free-free zones were being adequately policed.
   Austria's new status also allows it to freely export to
Western Europe, Japan and Australia computers containing most
kinds of U.S.-made semiconductors and other components.
Previously, Austrian computer makers have been required in
many instances to get U.S. permission to export products
containing such U.S. parts.
