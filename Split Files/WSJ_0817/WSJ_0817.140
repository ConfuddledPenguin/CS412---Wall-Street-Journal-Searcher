   The drought-stricken city of Santa Barbara, Calif., is
turning to the Pacific Ocean to help satisfy the thirst of
its parched residents.
   Santa Barbara, a coastal city of roughly 80,000 people
about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, agreed Tuesday to a
five-year contract with Ionics Inc. The deal calls for the
Watertown, Mass., company to build a desalination plant and
sell water produced by it to the city. The plant could supply
as much as a third of the city's water.

   Water experts hailed Santa Barbara's decision as an
important spur to desalination, which generally is considered
too expensive and technically dicey to satisfy the
drinking-water needs of most cities. Desalination produces
drinking water by removing salt from sea water through a
filtration process called reverse osmosis. The process is
relatively expensive because it uses much electricity.
   "This certainly lends credibility to the effort," said
Lori Griggs, executive director for the Committee for Water
Policy, a lobbying group in San Francisco. "It will light a
fire that should prompt improvements in the technology."
   The city's decision also is a boost for Ionics, which
seeks to harvest a potentially huge market for desalinated
water in the parched West. Mainly, Ionics sells its
desalination plants and services to remote islands, or
communities in Florida that need to desalt brackish
groundwater. The company earned $3.6 million on sales of $109
million in 1989.
   "This gives Ionics a chance to prove their technology in
California coastal waters," said David Landecker, a Santa
Barbara City Council member. Mr. Landecker said Santa Barbara
still must decide how large a plant it wants Ionics to build.
The options under consideration would cost from $23 million
to $55 million and result in increases to city water bills of
anywhere from 42% to 67%.
   Rather than seeking to pioneer the process, Santa Barbara
is opting for desalination "out of desperation," Mr.
Landecker said. "We need water."
   A six-year drought has left this coastal city and its
environs drier than at anytime since the late 1860s. The city
and surrounding communities have imposed strict rationing
plans on residents. To make matters worse, the area isn't
part of the state's huge water-supply project. Its sole large
reservoir is at its lowest level ever and projected to go dry
in a year should the area suffer another winter of
below-normal rainfall.
   Ionics insists it can help Santa Barbara, a popular
tourist destination, stave off disaster. Desalination "is
practically viable and is looking more attractive as
alternatives, such as bringing in water from northern
California, are getting more expensive," said Arthur L.
Goldstein, Ionics's chairman. Already, several other water
agencies in California are studying a move to desalination.
In July, the giant Metropolitan Water District, which
provides more than half of the water used by 15 million
Southern Californians, began planning a demonstration
desalination plant.
   Next month, Marin County, which relies exclusively on
local wells and reservoirs, will begin testing drinking water
from an experimental plant designed to purify water from
nearby San Francisco Bay. Marin considers desalination "a
long-term water supply," but isn't likely to reap drinking
water from the bay before 1995, said Ronald Johnson, general
manager of the Marin Municipal Water District.
   Though California communities are scrambling for new water
sources to meet their growing populations and ward off
worries about a lengthening drought, basic economics could
well delay the acceptance of desalination. Desalination
remains a far costlier way to obtain water than traditional
sources, which cost roughly ten times less.
   "Technically, its not hard to do" said Ian Watson, a
desalination expert in Fort Myers, Fla. "But the economics of
sea-water conversion have to be dealt with. It's going to
cost more to make {drinking} water out of the ocean than
Californians have been used to paying."
   Even Santa Barbara is reluctant to describe its commitment
to desalination as anything more than an emergency measure.
"We're looking at this as a temporary supply," said Mayor
Sheila Lodge.
