   RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank -- It is the middle of a
weekday, but the shops lining the main market square of this
battered Palestinian town of 40,000 are closed, their metal
shutters locked tight.
   Ramallah, like every other town in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, came to a standstill Wednesday as
Palestinian residents strictly observed a general strike
called to protest the U.S. "occupation" of Saudi Arabia, and
to demonstrate support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Spray-painted graffiti attests to the intensity of local
feeling: "Defeat to America" proclaims one. "The hand that is
raised against Iraq should be amputated" reads another. A
fake bomb was placed in the town square, looking real enough
to cause Israeli troops to evacuate the area.

   Earlier in the week, the imam of a mosque in Bethlehem was
pulled out of his pulpit after questioning the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait. Palestinians flooded the streets in celebration
when a short-lived rumor circulated that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak had been assassinated, and an Israeli TV crew
was stoned at a pro-Iraqi parade.
   Developments in the Persian Gulf are clearly exacerbating
tensions between Arabs and Jews in Israel's occupied
territories. Until Iraq invaded Kuwait two weeks ago, the
30-month-long Palestinian uprising known as the "intifada"
was considered to be losing momentum and direction. "The
intifada was almost at a stalemate," says Palestinian
journalist Abdul Magid Abu Ghosh. "But Saddam has boosted
morale, and given it new force."
   Yet while the Palestinians are elated at the prospect of a
strong, new, Arab leader endorsing their cause, some Arab and
other leaders are beginning to fear that Palestine Liberation
Organization head Yasser Arafat's alliance with Saddam
Hussein may prove politically suicidal in the long run.
   "There is little doubt, the PLO will pay a price," says
Palestinian activist Daoud Kuttab in East Jerusalem. "The
sentiment in the West Bank and Gaza was just so strong. It
was like a flood, but it may be that the Palestinians have
made a mistake."
   Mr. Arafat's support for the Iraqi invasion may have won
him popularity among Palestinians, but it has hurt him
elsewhere and has even stirred opposition within the PLO.
Diplomats familiar with the thinking of Arab leaders say
support remains strong for the Palestinian cause, but that
some nations will be more reluctant to continue bankrolling
any organization led by Mr. Arafat. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
refused to meet him when he was in Jiddah last week.
   In addition to the loss of financial backing, hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians employed in the gulf states may
find their jobs in jeopardy. "Many will likely be fired,"
says Mr. Kuttab.
   In Europe too, there has been some fallout for the
Palestinians. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who has
been meeting with European leaders, says several nations are
reconsidering their support for the PLO. Italy's Foreign
Minister Gianni de Michelis said that if Mr. Arafat doesn't
renounce his support for Saddam Hussein, Italy will "revise
its attitude toward the PLO."
   At a time when the intifada had begun to win sympathy
abroad, thereby increasing U.S. pressure on Israel to
negotiate with the Palestinians, this setback in public
opinion is elating the Israelis. Israeli and Arab officials
now agree that given the distraction of events in the gulf,
and the pro-Iraqi stand taken by Mr. Arafat, the sputtering
peace talks will stall even further.
   "It just underlines what we've said all along," says Avi
Pazner, communications adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. "The threat to the region isn't from Israeli friction
with the Palestinians, but from the behavior of some Arab
countries, like Iraq."
   Although Mr. Pazner voices the official Israeli line that
he doesn't wish to see the peace talks derailed, he
nonetheless says that "it is difficult to see how the
Palestinians, who are very pro-Saddam Hussein, can talk with
us calmly now. The situation is very heated, and these talks
require a calm atmosphere." Israel's deputy foreign minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, says, "The intentions of the PLO and Iraq
are the same: the liquidation of Israel."
   Some Palestinian leaders have begun to try to shade their
support for Iraq. The inconsistency of Palestinian support of
Baghdad's taking of land by force, while insisting that
Israel has wrongly done the same thing, strains logic. Faisal
Husseini, a Palestinian activist in Jerusalem, says somewhat
cryptically over a cup of thick, sweet Turkish coffee, "We
are, in a way, for Iraq and against Kuwait, and also, for
Kuwait and against Iraq."
   But out in the tank and donkey-trampled streets of the
Israeli-occupied territories, no such moderation is to be
found. Saddam Hussein's twin messages of anti-Americanism and
Pan-Arabism, as well as his inflaming of resentment between
the Arab haves and have-nots, plays to an avid audience. So
strong is the feeling, several residents of Ramallah suggest
they would have turned on Mr. Arafat had he not sided with
Iraq.
   "The support for Saddam is very strong here," says a
teenager. "Saddam is a hero. Many of us would like to fight
for him."
   "Saddam Hussein is a shah, he is our godfather," says a
toothless builder, Jasser Shahin, sitting on a shaded porch
in the steep, rocky town of Ein Arik. "What we want is for
him to unite all Arabs as a superpower." Reflecting the view
of impoverished Palestinians that Saddam Hussein is an Arab
Robin Hood, he says:
   "We aren't benefiting from the sheiks' oil. Saddam wants
the whole Arab world to share. I hear one emir spent half a
million dollars sending his cat to London, while people here
don't have enough to eat."
   Educated Palestinians in the occupied territories are
equally enthusiastic about Saddam Hussein, although some see
risks. Lawyer Shukri Aboud, who is close to the Palestine
Liberation Front, hangs a photo of Saddam Hussein in his
Ramallah living room. If there is a conventional war against
the U.S., he thinks Iraq may win. But he worries that if not,
the Palestinian fate will be buried along with Iraq's.
   "We Palestinians cannot bear one more defeat," he says.
"It would consecrate the Israeli occupation for at least
another hundred years."
   Given such risks, the Ramallah journalist, Mr. Ghosh,
struggles to explain why the Palestinians have thrown in
their lot with Iraq. He says Palestinians watched warily as
Mr. Arafat made concessions last year in an effort to reach
peace with Israel. "He took almost all his clothes off in
front of the whole world, and still got nothing," Mr. Ghosh
says. "We have tried negotiations. What else can we do?"
