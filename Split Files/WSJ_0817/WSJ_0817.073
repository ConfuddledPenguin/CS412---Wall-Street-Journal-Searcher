   JAPAN LOOKS TO THE SUN

   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
it will begin basic research next year on a
photovoltaic-power system in space to capture the energy of
the sun and send it back to Earth.
   Solar-power units stationed in space would be more
efficient than ground-based photovoltaic-power systems,
officials told a Japanese news agency. They explained that
while much of the sun's energy is filtered out by the Earth's
atmosphere and clouds, that wouldn't happen in space.
   The project envisions a generator equipped with a
solar-panel unit in geostationary orbit. A panel unit of
three to six square miles would generate five million
kilowatts, roughly equivalent to the output of about five
nuclear-power stations, the officials said.
   Energy captured by the solar-panel unit would be sent by
microwave signals or laser to a ground-based receiver.
                                                                                                       

   ASIAN TOURISM FEARS
                                                                                                       

   Member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations may have to adjust their tourism projections because
of the anticipated drop in tourist traffic due to higher oil
prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis, industry
sources said. The 1992 Visit ASEAN Year working committee is
scheduled to discuss its marketing plan in Kuala Lumpur this
month.
                                                                                                       

   MULTIPARTY MOZAMBIQUE
                                                                                                       

   The ruling Frelimo party's central committee has endorsed
resolutions calling for adoption of a multiparty system and
new election laws, meeting a key demand of rebels fighting
the government, the Mozambique government news agency said.
President Joaquim Chissano said on July 31 he wanted a
multiple party system in place for parliamentary and
presidential elections next year.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINES LIFTS BAN
                                                                                                       

   The Philippine government will lift an eight-year ban on
Soviet ships at a shipyard near the U.S. naval base at Subic
Bay, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon told a Japanese news
agency. Shipyard restrictions on vessels from the Soviet
Union and other East bloc countries were imposed in 1982 at
the request of the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   MONKEY BUSINESS
                                                                                                       

   An Australian city is considering using monkeys to pick
coconuts from trees along its seafront walk to prevent the
nuts from falling on tourists. "They'd splatter you if they
hit you. It's bloody frightening," said Les Bass, a spokesman
for palm-fringed Cairns City Council in northeast Australia.
Using monkeys, possibly from Malaysia, was proposed by
Alderman Bob Burgess, who suggested they would amuse tourists
while protecting sightseers and picnickers from lethal cracks
on the head.
                                                                                                       

   SAMSUNG PLAN REJECTED
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean Trade and Industry Ministry rejected a
plan by Samsung Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Industries Co. to
produce large trucks using Japanese technology. Ministry
officials said the application to introduce technology from
Nissan Diesel Motor Co. would be returned to Samsung.
                                                                                                       

   MONGOLIAN MOTHERLAND
                                                                                                       

   While China pleads with its teeming millions to have just
one child per couple, across the border in sparsely populated
Mongolia it's the more the merrier.
   "Children are the flowers of our life," said "hero mother"
Orsoo, expressing a common Mongolian sentiment. "They are our
future." The 50-year-old mother of 10 and her husband
received a government loan to build a new home as a reward
for having a large family. Mrs. Orsoo, winner of a red star
medal, said families of eight or more also get $300 a year in
government subsidies, a princely sum in Mongolia.
   Mongolia's communist rulers until recently prohibited
birth control. Activists, such as prominent pediatrician and
public health official Munkhuu, have pushed the authorities
in the past year to legalize contraceptives, saying Mongolian
women are risking their health because they have too many
babies too quickly. Legalization of contraception is one of
many reforms instituted since March, when demonstrations
forced the communists to renounce their monopoly on power.
   However, official approval of large families remains
unchanged. "Our birth-control policy was and is one of
encouraging population growth, because our population is so
small," Mr. Munkhuu said.
   Mongolia, a country the size of Western Europe, has a
population of only two million. Its birthrate is high at 36
births per 1,000 people, and the average family has about
five children.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A Bank of China vice president, Lei Zufa, was publicly
reprimanded by the government for lavish entertaining at
state expense, the official radio reported. The banker and an
unspecified number of diners were ordered to reimburse the
government for $1,590 spent at three recent banquets. . . .
West Germany's Kunsthalle Bremen museum said it expects to
recover soon 362 valuable drawings and watercolors taken to
the Soviet Union during World War II, including works by
Durer, Rubens and Van Gogh.
