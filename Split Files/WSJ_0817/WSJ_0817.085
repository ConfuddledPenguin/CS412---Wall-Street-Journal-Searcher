   When Multnomah County, Oregon, officials two months ago
began rousting those urban outdoorsmen known as the homeless
from their encampments under bridges and along railroad
tracks, they expected the load at official shelters to swell.
It didn't. Either there weren't as many homeless as was
thought, or they couldn't face the "zero-tolerance" policy of
some of the shelters toward intoxicants. The liberal
Oregonian newspaper, under the headline "Boozers get boot,"
quotes a Salvation Army official saying of transients who
won't straighten up: "Portland may not be willing to tolerate
their lifestyle any longer."
