   McCaffrey &amp; McCall's management has agreed in principle to
buy the ad agency from parent Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., but at a
price lower than initially expected, executives close to the
talks said.
   The proposed buy-back follows more than a year of
negotiations and shows just how far the fortunes of Saatchi
and the ad business in general have fallen since those
negotiations began. According to the executives, McCaffrey
would put up $2 million and receive $15 million in notes from
Saatchi, which McCaffrey will pay back over several years.
The total purchase price is significantly less than the
approximately $32 million total Saatchi paid for the agency,
whose blue-chip clients include Mercedes-Benz, Burroughs
Wellcome and Bacardi.

   The proposed purchase price is also less than half of the
approximately $40 million Saatchi had been demanding early in
the talks. And it is less than the $25 million to $30 million
deal that McCaffrey announced it was close to striking last
November. That deal never came to fruition, in part because,
with banks becoming more cautious and demanding more
restrictive terms, McCaffrey executives couldn't find
favorable financing.
   McCaffrey &amp; McCall declined comment, and Saatchi
executives couldn't be reached. But people familiar with the
talks said that if all goes according to plan, the proposed
buy-back would probably be completed and announced around the
end of Saatchi's Sept. 30 fiscal year.
   The proposed transaction reflects Saatchi Chief Executive
Robert Louis-Dreyfus's determination to streamline the
troubled advertising giant as quickly as possible. Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus earlier this year dumped the bulk of Saatchi's
consulting businesses at a loss, selling Peterson Consulting,
for example, for which Saatchi had paid $116 million, for
less than $20 million. Analysts have lauded Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus's speed, saying that despite the low prices,
they are encouraged he is taking decisive steps to turn the
ailing company around.
   The depressed price also reflects the declining fortunes
of the ad business. Just since last fall, ad agency
valuations in general have fallen, both because of the
uncertain economic environment and because the ad spending
outlook is mediocre on a good day. Saatchi's financial
position has also deteriorated, though investors so far
appear to have confidence in Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, a French
executive who was brought in to take charge in January.
   "The company and the marketplace have changed dramatically
in the last months," said an executive familiar with the
talks in explaining why the price is lower than initially
expected. Industry executives, however, say that McCaffrey
remains profitable.
   McCaffrey has been trying to buy itself back because the
agency doesn't fit well with the rest of the Saatchi empire.
With billings of $254.2 million, it is small by Saatchi
standards; Saatchi's two major agency groups both have
billings exceeding $4.7 billion. At the same time, McCaffrey
has found it difficult to grow because it can't take on
clients that would compete with the accounts at its bigger
siblings. Industry executives say Mercedes, for example, is
uncomfortable because other Saatchi units handle Toyota and
Hyundai.
   McCaffrey also suffers from perennially low visiblity
because it is so overshadowed by its larger sister agencies.
Despite such classy, high-profile accounts as Tiffany and
Hartford Insurance, the agency doesn't draw the kind of
attention that other mid-sized agencies, such as Ammirati &amp;
Puris and Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver, have attracted.

   Tatham-Laird Fills Posts
                                                                                                       

   Tatham-Laird Kudner, Chicago, made several changes in its
top management because of recent new business and the
departure earlier this year of an executive.
   William Youngclaus, who had been president and chief
operating officer, joined Tatham-Laird's parent, RSCG Group,
in Paris last March as president of RSCG-Europe.
   Under the reorganization, Ralph Rydholm, currently
managing partner and chief creative officer, was given the
additional post of Tatham-Laird chairman, taking a title that
Charlotte Beers, who remains chief executive officer, had
previously held. Ian Miller, most recently a senior vice
president at Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Chicago, was named president
and managing partner. A spokesman said the agency's growth --
earlier this week it won the estimated $15 million account
for Procter &amp; Gamble's Old Spice and Santa Fe men's
toiletries -- spurred Mr. Miller's hiring.
   Bob Hielscher, formerly a senior partner, was promoted to
chief operating officer and managing partner.

   Gatorade Ad Threat
                                                                                                       

   The mayor of Siena, Italy, says his city will take legal
action in response to Gatorade ads that used an altered photo
from the city's Palio festival.
   Full-page ads appeared in Italian newspapers this week
showing a flag-bearer from the centuries-old horse race
carrying a flag altered to bear Gatorade's name and logo.
   Siena, a city of 60,000 in central Italy, in the past has
fought to block others -- including car maker Fiat and TV
baron Silvio Berlusconi -- from profiting from association
with the festival.
   The Palio is the name of a banner that's given to the
winner of a horse race run three times around the city's
oval-shaped central piazza. The race is televised nationally
and draws tens of thousands of tourists to the city.
   A city spokeswoman said the city will almost certainly sue
Pirella Gottsche Lowe, the Milan agency that prepared the ad,
but she didn't know whether Quaker Oats, maker of Gatorade,
would also be named.

   NEW ACCOUNT: Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream awarded its $8
million to $10 million account to Goldberg Moser O'Neill, San
Francisco. The Oakland, Calif.-based ice cream company is the
second win for the former Chiat/Day/Mojo San Francisco office
since its management buy-out. The account, which had been at
Hal Riney &amp; Partners, was most recently handled by
free-lancers.
