   Test your post-Cold War IQ:
   Which Member of Congress has fretted the most about George
Bush's Mideast intervention -- anti-Contra crusader Chris
Dodd of Connecticut, flaky New York liberal Ted Weiss or
sober Georgia hawk Sam Nunn?

   If you said Sen. Nunn, you're ahead of the curve in the
fast-evolving politics of foreign policy. While liberals have
praised Mr. Bush, Mr. Nunn has typified conservatives who've
worried, grumbled and caviled. In one amazing TV exchange,
this paper's ardently centrist Washington bureau chief,
Albert Hunt, had to hold the hawkish line against
conservatives Robert Novak and Pat Buchanan. "Neville Novak,"
he said, is "General Patton when it comes to Grenada, a place
that doesn't count," but Neville Chamberlain "when it comes
to our national interest."
   Mr. Novak is an Arabist, which may account for his unusual
lapse. But the explanation for the angst of other
conservatives is more disturbing: The return of the right's
traditional isolationism. This inward-looking nationalism,
with roots back to George Washington's farewell address, has
lain dormant since the 1950s. But with the demise of
communism as an enemy, it's been waking up. The Iraqi crisis
has brought its sentiments out of the closet.
   Few of these erstwhile hawks are yet opposing the Bush
action, but their support has been grudging or hedged -- not
unlike Michael Dukakis's reaction to the U.S. strike against
Libya. They're even resorting to anti-intervention arguments
long used by the left.
   Some now suggest that we defend only democracies. Pat
Buchanan, who once derided liberals for heading "for the tall
grass" on Central America, worries that Americans may die to
put "the emir of Kuwait back on the throne." But he didn't
seem to mind defending Vietnamese or Koreans who were
governed by generals. And he neglects the fate of a very
helpful democracy to the west of Iraq, Israel.
   Others invoke that familiar red herring, the U.S. "global
policeman." The worrywarts at the Washington Times complain
that Mr. Bush "promises to commit us to military
confrontations and an endless series of diplomatic crises in
the future." He does? In fact, Mr. Bush has already managed
to keep America well clear of post-Cold War conflicts in
Liberia and Kashmir. A policy of intervention doesn't forego
prudential judgments about national interests, or the limits
of U.S. power. Regarding Iraq, Mr. Bush may go too far in
saying the American "way of life" is at stake, but the U.S.
interest in post-Cold War stability surely is.
   Still other conservatives are born-again multilateralists.
"Our efforts ought to be aimed at our allies," says Oklahoma
GOP Rep. Mickey Edwards. "Since when did it become our role
to be the sole defender of the Saudi Arabian oil fields?"
This lack-of-international-support line is one liberals used
against Mr. Edwards's efforts to aid the Contras. While it's
great to have the allies onboard, does anybody believe they'd
act if the U.S. didn't lead? Because the allies are
hesitating over a blockade -- sorry, "interdiction" -- should
Mr. Bush now drop the idea?
   Mr. Edwards could fairly say the Gulf (far away) is not
Central America (our backyard). But that merely illustrates
another trait of right-wing isolationism: Its disengagement
from the world is selective. Burton Yale Pines of the
Heritage Foundation supports Mr. Bush, but also says the U.S.
should now intervene unilaterally only in Asia and the
Americas. Why Asia? "Because we're the only ones who can do
it," he says. But that's largely true of the Gulf, too.
   By arbitrarily limiting the U.S. sphere of action,
conservatives invite regional powers to maraud outside it.
Mr. Pines compares America's post-Cold War role to "the chief
of a volunteer fire department. We'll ring the alarm and
drive the truck," he says. But the corollary is that if no
one else jumps on the truck, we'll let the fire burn. And in
a world of proliferating nuclear weapons and ballistic
missiles, some fires can quickly spread.
   The doubting hawks do have two legitimate worries. The
first is that the liberal establishment will once again lose
its nerve, as it did in Vietnam. Liberals approved the Tonkin
Gulf resolution, after all. Mr. Bush could yet lose his
nerve, too, settling for a stalemate that solves nothing but
costs much. These are understandable fears, but they are not
a case for doing nothing; they're a case for doing what has
to be done to win.
   Right-wing isolationism is a small movement for now, but
watch it grow at the first sign of trouble in Iraq.
California Republican Rep. Robert Dornan says he strongly
supports Mr. Bush's action, but warns that, "It will be only
a matter of time before Republicans ask why American boys are
fighting to defend one monarchy and to restore another."
   Beyond oil or chemical weapons, Mr. Bush's efforts are
critical as a test of U.S. ability to deter and contain
post-Cold War rogues who threaten our interests. Failure
might unite right and left isolationism in blocking such
efforts in the future. This is the same coalition that left
us unprepared for World War II.
   Conservative Republicans ought to be especially wary. The
Democratic Party's strain of liberal isolationism is one
reason voters haven't trusted the likes of Mr. Dukakis to be
commander-in-chief. But the same fate befell Republicans not
so long ago. Sen. Robert Taft, the conservative hero of the
1940s and 1950s, voted against NATO, as did most
conservatives until Barry Goldwater. Pat Buchanan may revere
Taft, but running for president he couldn't even win the
Republican nomination.
