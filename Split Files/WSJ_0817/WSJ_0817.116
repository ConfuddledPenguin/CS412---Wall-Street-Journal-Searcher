   Imports accounted for more than half of the nation's oil
consumption in July for the third month in a row.
   An average of just under nine million barrels a day of
crude oil and petroleum products were imported last month,
the American Petroleum Institute reported, up 8.4% from the
same month last year. Foreign oil accounted for 51.3% of
total July deliveries; for the first seven months of the year
it averaged 50.0%. The API said the increase in part
reflected buying in advance of widely anticipated price
increases last month. This month, prices have risen even more
because of the Middle East crisis.

   Nonetheless, the July figures are "a harbinger of the
future," said Charles DiBona, API president. He noted that
the recent string of 50%-plus import months have been coupled
with a continuing decline in domestic oil output. API said
domestic crude production last month dropped 5.3% to just
over seven million barrels a day compared with the year-ago
month.
   "The decline, which has persisted for more than four years
. . . has reduced domestic crude oil output by roughly two
million barrels a day or 20% since early 1986," the API said.
