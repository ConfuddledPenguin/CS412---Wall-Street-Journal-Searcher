   New York state and federal investigators arrested a
14-year-old boy who was suspected of using a home computer to
break into a Pentagon computer used by the office of the
Secretary of the Air Force.
   Investigators also searched 17 locations yesterday in New
York, Westchester County and Long Island, seizing computer
equipment and data storage devices. Five men, ranging in age
from 17 to 32, were arrested in the sweep and charged with
computer tampering and trespass, unauthorized entry and theft
of services. They were suspected of breaking into a computer
at the City University of Bellevue, Wash. Investigators said
the 14-year-old was also linked to the Bellevue intrusion.

   The arrests were part of a two-month investigation by the
New York state police, U.S. Secret Service, Air Force Office
of Special Investigations, the New York attorney general and
other agencies.
   Major Steve Headley of the Air Force investigations office
said the Pentagon computer that was penetrated was part of an
administrative network and did not contain any classified
information. "There was no breach of national security," he
said.
   Investigators did not release the name of the 14-year-old,
who will be charged as a juvenile delinquent.
