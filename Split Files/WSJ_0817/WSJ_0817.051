   Lenox, Mass. -- The first recording by Valery Gergiev, a
37-year-old Soviet conductor plucked out of obscurity two
years ago to head the Kirov Theatre of Leningrad, is the
summer's most hyped and widely discussed classical release.
Unfortunately for Mr. Gergiev, few reviewers of the Philips
disc seemed to notice that he was part of the enterprise.
That's because they were fixated on the singer making his
recording debut on the same disc. This glamorous young Soviet
baritone, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, is the newest star in the
operatic firmament. And Mr. Gergiev was essentially deploying
the Rotterdam Philharmonic as a grandiose accompanist.
   Mr. Gergiev also nearly failed to be noticed in his first
public appearance in the U.S. At a recent Saturday morning
open rehearsal at Tanglewood, the young maestro walked onto
the stage mostly unrecognized. Wearing a blue-and-green
Tanglewood T-shirt he could have been any local conducting
student. And when, without ice-breaking small talk, he
gestured to the Boston Symphony Orchestra violins to edge
into the six shimmering A-major chords that begin Wagner's
Prelude to "Lohengrin," many in the audience continued
talking.

   Those opening chords, however, were wonderfully wrought,
and it didn't take long for Mr. Gergiev to grab his
listeners' attention. As the volume increased, the phrasing
turned bold and vivid, and it became clear that Mr. Gergiev
is an unusually intense and unpredictable conductor.
   That night, his passionate performance of Tchaikovsky's
Fifth Symphony -- an unlikely interpretation in which a
ponderous first movement, an unconventionally light and
Italianate Andante, a raspy Waltz and a spasmodically
exciting Finale all sounded inevitable -- brought a huge and
astonished Tanglewood crowd to its feet.
   Apparently that same scenario has been playing itself out
regularly for Mr. Gergiev over the past two years. At the
Kirov in 1988, Mr. Gergiev almost instantly turned into one
of the three or four most important and powerful conductors
in the Soviet Union. Since then, he has been busily
conducting all over Europe and in Japan. He serves as
principal guest conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic,
while continuing with the Kirov. He has signed a major
recording contract with Philips, and he now has his own
blockbuster release in the shops -- Mussorgsky's "Pictures at
an Exhibition."
   If success is happening with startling speed for Mr.
Gergiev, he seems ready for it. He is, above all else, a fast
learner, something that helped him right from the beginning,
as a piano student of 14 or 15 in a village in the Caucasus.
"I was mainly interested in playing soccer -- we are crazy
about this game in the Caucasus," he explains, with the same
bug-eyed intensity he brings to the podium. "I thought so
much about sports, I always learned my sonatas the very last
two or three days before my examination. But I learned very
fast. So my teacher thought that I must have some talent but
that I was too lazy to become a pianist, and she asked me to
start thinking about conducting.
   "Nobody, of course, expected that I would become one of
the leading conductors of my country," Mr. Gergiev continues
in fluid English, which he reputedly learned in a year. Mr.
Gergiev enrolled in the Leningrad Conservatory to study
conducting. But it wasn't easy for a young conductor in
Leningrad to get ahead. The Soviet Union's greatest
conductor, the very self-protective Yevgeny Mravinsky, ruled
supreme over the Leningrad Philharmonic until his death in
1988. So Mr. Gergiev turned to the Kirov, where he found a
job as a lowly assistant conductor. And without perestroika,
that is undoubtedly where he would have remained when the
Kirov's director, Yuri Temirkanov, was selected to succeed
Mravinsky at the Leningrad Philharmonic.
   "Before perestroika," Mr. Gergiev claims, "the officials
made all musical appointments, and the minister of culture
selected another man to head the Kirov after Temirkanov
left." But completely to Mr. Gergiev's and the nation's
surprise, the musicians and singers of the company held their
own defiant election and selected him by a vote of 85%. "This
simply could not have happened a year earlier."
   Mr. Gergiev immediately set out to make his mark at the
Kirov, and only seven months after his appointment he
produced a major Mussorgsky festival that was of
unprecedented scope in Soviet musical history. He mounted all
five Mussorgsky operas, including the unfinished opera based
on Flaubert's "Salammbo," which had never been performed in
the Soviet Union and for which Mr. Gergiev commissioned a new
scholarly edition of the score. He performed the epic opera
"Khovanshchina" complete, another Kirov first, and has now
recorded it for Philips. Most notably he recently arranged to
import a production of "Boris Godunov" from Covent Garden,
the only opera directed by the late Soviet film maker Andrei
Tarkovsky. It was televised live and will be out next year on
a London videodisc.
   Mr. Gergiev boasts that his Mussorgsky festival was the
talk of all the Soviet Union, and his new recording of
"Pictures at an Exhibition" backs him up. The performance is
a distinctive one even in a competitive market. There may be
dozens of versions of the piece on the market, but few
conductors are willing to take some of the risks Mr. Gergiev
does. Caring little for the modern fashion of sacrificing
expressiveness for instrumental brilliance, his account often
sounds raw in comparison with the others, as if he is pushing
every player to the limit.
   Whether this hyperexpressive approach will prove as
compelling in non-Russian repertoire remains to be seen. Mr.
Gergiev's Wagner and Mozart program at Tanglewood didn't make
quite the impact his Tchaikovsky one did. But that hardly
matters right now, since Mr. Gergiev has lots of Russian
opera on his mind. Next up for the Kirov is a festival of all
the Prokofiev operas, then all those of RimskyKorsakov,
assuming the rocky Soviet economy can fund these very
ambitious projects. Meanwhile, Mr. Gergiev will keep
traveling. He returns to the U.S. in October for two weeks
with the San Francisco Symphony, and then will appear with
orchestras in Dallas, Houston, Minnesota, Toronto and New
York. Next year he will conduct his first opera in this
country -- a new production of Prokofiev's "War and Peace" at
the San Francisco Opera.
