   U.K. Central Bank Says Mideast Crisis
   Won't Kick Off 1970s-Style Inflation

   LONDON -- Central bankers say the new round of oil-price
increases won't ignite inflation the way those of the 1970s
did, largely because monetary authorities have learned some
valuable lessons about how to handle them.
   That was one of the assuring messages the Bank of England
disseminated yesterday along with its latest economic
bulletin. Many private economists and officials from the West
German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy are speaking along
similar lines. The brokerage concern UBS Phillips &amp; Drew even
took the position in a report this week that this year's oil
shock is really just a "shockette."

   But the relatively breezy assessments make two fundamental
assumptions that may be overturned by events: that the crisis
won't spread and disrupt production outside Iraq and Kuwait,
and that oil prices won't push much higher than $25 a barrel.
   Assuming that bigger price increases can be avoided, a
Bank of England official said, the major economic powers
should be able to deal with the disruption better than they
did during the 1970s. Generally, the official said, "the
message that the monetary authorities received from those
episodes is that they {would} do well not to adopt an
accommodating stance."
   An accommodating stance would be one where governments
loosened credit, increased spending or cut taxes to offset
the effect of higher energy bills. But in the 1970s, such
policies helped set off a general rise in prices and wages,
the central bankers said, without bringing about the real
economic growth that was desired.
   This time, one European central banker said, it's clear
that "there's no reason for a reduction in interest rates."
   Officials from the Bank of England said the need to blunt
the inflationary effects of more costly oil, together with
Eastern Europe's hunger for capital, means that "the
medium-term prospects are for high interest rates," which
will have the effect of slowing down national economies.
   Although Britain's economy has already been squeezed, with
its base lending rate currently at 15%, the Bank of England
didn't express any intention of easing. "We want to maintain
a non-accommodating policy and firm exchange rates," an
official said. He added that this stance is consistent with
entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System. "Going into the mechanism needn't be thought
of as a new departure," he said.
   Another reason for optimism about the consequences of the
Middle East crisis, the Bank of England said, is that the
oil-producing nations themselves will show different economic
behavior this time. Specifically, they are expected to spend
more on foreign investments and in building up their own
economies. That should lessen one of the big problems of the
1970s -- recycling the petrodollars that flowed in waves to
the Middle East.
   For Britain, the crisis has caused a mix of economic
consequences, the Bank of England said. Inflation, expected
to rise to 10% or higher in the government report due out
today, will be more difficult to tame with energy costs
rising. However, the British pound has strengthened
considerably since Iraq invaded Kuwait two weeks ago, and
that has the effect of making imports cheaper. It also
encourages U.K. companies to keep prices under control
because British goods are already being made more expensive
by the rising value of the currency.
   More broadly, the Bank of England urged major Western
nations to encourage higher savings to support what is
expected to be a heavy demand for capital. The bank cited the
reconstruction of the Eastern European economies, which will
be hit hard by oil-price increases, and the even heavier
demand for capital from the U.S. The Bush administration's
budget deficit is expected to come to $170 billion in 1991,
excluding the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout. If the
oil shocks send the U.S. economy into recession, the
government's lake of red ink is expected to grow.
