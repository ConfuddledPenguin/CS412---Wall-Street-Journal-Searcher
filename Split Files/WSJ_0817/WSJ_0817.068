   NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Board may have ended the
takeover of Northeast Bancorp by Bank of New York Co., but
Northeast isn't giving up completely.
   On Wednesday, the Fed denied Bank of New York's petition
to acquire Northeast for $195.6 million, saying the merger
would hurt Bank of New York's ability to maintain a strong
capital position.

   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Northeast plunged
$5.25 to $12.25; Bank of New York fell 12.5 cents to $24.375
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Although the Fed's decision could be appealed by either
bank, such actions are unusual. Immediately after the
decision Bank of New York said the merger couldn't go
forward. But yesterday Northeast said it is considering
putting additional breach of contract charges in a lawsuit
seeking either to complete the merger or obtain damages from
Bank of New York.
   Bank of New York "had an agreement to acquire us and an
obligation to maintain the capital levels that would let them
consummate that agreement," said George Kabureck, president
of Northeast.
   What started as a friendly merger agreement in 1983
deteriorated badly in recent months as the banks argued over
the book value of Northeast, a critical element in
determining what price Bank of New York would pay for
Northeast. (The agreement was pending revisions in
Connecticut banking laws that would allow out-of-state
purchases.)
   Northeast claimed a book value that would result in a
purchase price of about $500 million, while Bank of New York
said a price of $195.6 million was more appropriate
considering the shaky nature of some of Northeast's real
estate portfolio. Northeast sued to force Bank of New York
either to complete the merger at the higher cost or to pay
damages.
   A Bank of New York spokesman said Northeast's charges are
"ludicrous." He said Northeast officials saw Bank of New
York's application to the Fed before it was filed and never
issued any objections to the financial statements in the
application, including Bank of New York's capital position.
   Mr. Kabureck said the application was given to Northeast
on a Friday afternoon before Bank of New York filed it with
the Fed the following Monday. He said Northeast would decide
in the next few days what steps it would take involving the
court suit.
