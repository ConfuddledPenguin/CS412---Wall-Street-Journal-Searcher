   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, while renewing a call for an
emergency meeting of oil ministers, said they plan to
increase output with or without OPEC's approval.
   Their idea is to replace much of the four million barrels
of oil a day lost to world markets from the international
embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes. That, in turn,
would slow the recent runup in petroleum prices, satisfy
pledges made to the Bush administration in regard to the
Middle East crisis and restrict the bold grab by Iran and
some others for former oil customers of Iraq.

   The strategy would include a gradual expansion of Saudi
Arabia's output by between 1.5 million and two million
barrels a day and Venezuela's by 500,000 barrels a day. Some
other nations in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries with spare oil capacity also probably would be
involved, including the United Arab Emirates, which could
increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.
   Whatever the decisions, they now are due quickly --
possibly by this weekend. "The situation will be very clear
in a couple of days," a senior OPEC delegate who is close to
developments said yesterday.
   Venezuela has vacillated about filling the supply gap
created by the Middle East crisis, with government officials
in Caracas this week backing away from an earlier promise to
increase exports. Yesterday, however, there were new
indications that Venezuela now will be willing to join Saudi
Arabia and others in pumping more, after all. Saudi Arabia,
widely expected to help offset the deficit early on, hadn't
increased output substantially as it studied the matter.
   It is already obvious that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
still hope for OPEC's approval -- or at least that of a
majority of OPEC's 13 members -- so that they won't be
accused of unilaterally breaking the group's late-July
agreement limiting production. One formula under discussion
would maintain the OPEC production ceiling at 22.5 million
barrels a day but divide it among 11 nations instead of 13,
ignoring Iraq and Kuwait.
   Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, is understood
to have forwarded to Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister
and OPEC's president, a strongly worded letter urging again
that a special ministerial meeting be called promptly.
Meanwhile, Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,
publicly announced that the kingdom also is pressing for an
emergency meeting.
   "Saudi Arabia, with some other member countries of OPEC,
has requested an immediate meeting of the organization in
order to make a joint decision that will deal with the
current situation in the oil market," Mr. Nazer said in a
government statement.
   As expected, the Saudis also rescinded indicated supply
cuts for next month. This week, Saudi Aramco, the national
oil company, has been notifying U.S., European and Japanese
oil companies of volume cuts of 15% to 20% for September
shipments. The Aramco telexes got wide publicity amid
speculation that despite its indicated commitment to increase
production the kingdom was reducing it.
   In Tokyo, Japanese buyers suggested that Saudi Arabia was
aware of the large volume of oil Japan is buying from Iran in
September and was going to supply other companies that had
been cut off from Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes. Among veteran
customers of Saudi Aramco elsewhere the telexes also were
shrugged off. It was assumed that Aramco officials, deluged
by requests for oil in the wake of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis,
were trying to meet needs of old and new customers by
pro-rationing volumes available under their OPEC quota.
   "I think they got requests to supply Kuwait's customers,
including Kuwait Petroleum Co. {operating in exile}, and they
wanted to honor them," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of
the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. But, he added:
"They are still waiting for the king's decision to raise
supply."
   Whatever the reason for the telexes, new ones are going
out quickly. "There is going to be no cut for all our regular
customers," said a Saudi petroleum official.
   Despite the indications that added oil supplies will be
coming into the market soon, petroleum prices rose again
yesterday on increased Middle East tensions. Crude futures
were 60 cents a barrel higher on the London Petroleum
Exchange, and the September crude contract surged 90 cents,
to $27.36, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Also, U.S.
petroleum refiners raised field postings for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude, by 75 cents, to $26 a
barrel.
   Although some OPEC member nations, including Nigeria,
Libya and Iran, already have stepped up production slightly
to take advantage of the sharply higher demand for oil and
the higher prices, those that could really make a difference
have been slow to move. Meanwhile, Iraq, with the support of
its former war foe, Iran, has strongly condemned any
unilateral increases in oil output while its own supplies
remain embargoed.
   As of late yesterday, according to OPEC sources, some
others still remained opposed to any emergency meeting to
consider officially sanctioned production increases. Others
were on the fence, suggesting only that everyone wait a few
days.
   A major obstacle to any meeting of OPEC at this time is
the question of whether Kuwait would be represented and, if
so, by whom. On Aug. 2, Iraq marched in and took over its
neighbor.
   If Kuwait's government-in-exile is counted, however, six,
or possibly a majority of seven, of OPEC's 13 members
yesterday appeared in favor of an early emergency meeting.
"If this fails, or if we reach deadlock, a new avenue has to
be found," said one OPEC delegate, adding: "We feel we have
to act now to stabilize the market."
