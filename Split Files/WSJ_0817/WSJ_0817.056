   HOUSTON -- Comedians and clowns have been popping up in
recent years to make business meetings more lighthearted, fun
and memorable.
   But it's tough to get a laugh when the punch line is
"nonylphenol ethoxylate."

   Just ask Charles Greene III. The 29-year-old magician
specializes in bringing levity -- and levitation -- to the
petrochemical industry. Since 1988, he's played the trade
show circuit, using magic tricks to hawk resins, drug testing
and horizontal oil-field drilling.
   He's even sold cement. At the World of Concrete trade show
in Atlanta, he rhapsodized about drying time and durability
while turning a glass of water upside down without spilling a
drop.
   Other performers, says Mr. Greene, wouldn't touch cement
-- let alone nonylphenol ethoxylate, a chemical agent that
makes soaps bubble. They gravitate to sexier merchandise such
as pricey sneakers or food or toys. But Mr. Greene says he's
happiest when "the product itself is bland and doesn't have
an attractive quality."
   Specializing in a technical field, he says, gives him an
edge: "The more technical the industry, the better my chances
of being used." At a Houston trade show in March, he showed
off a horizontal oil-drilling technique by making a needle
thread itself.
   His performances may not be the stuff that made Houdini
famous, but Mr. Greene has found that making magic for
corporate America is pretty profitable. His fees start at
about $2,500 a day, including expenses. "If you're not
charging companies what they expect to pay, they won't think
you're any good," he says.
   Companies seem to be happy to add a little magic to their
act. A spokeswoman for Reichhold Chemicals Inc. said Mr.
Greene's appearance at the Cultured Marble Show in Charlotte,
N.C., earlier this year yielded "just rave reviews. His magic
is just so perfected that he's incredible."
   Others aren't so sure they want to comment. Asked about
Mr. Greene's performance at a national sales meeting in
February, a marketing director at Soltex Polymer Corp. passed
the question on to a product manager, who got the company's
legal counsel on the phone, who fobbed it off on a public
relations consultant.
   The final verdict, however, was positive. Said the
consultant: Mr. Greene is "a unique individual who has an
ability to understand a company."
