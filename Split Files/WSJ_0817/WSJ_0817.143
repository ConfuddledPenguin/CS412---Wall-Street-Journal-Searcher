   Your July 25 page-one article about the soft home-sale
market, which discussed the need for a family in Rye, N.Y.,
to lower their asking price for today's market, did not
mention the tremendous appreciation they will realize from
the eventual sale of their home.
   The Schenkers purchased their home in 1976 for $107,000,
and if they sell it in 1990 for $895,000 (their current
asking price lowered from $1.5 million), they will realize an
836% increase over the 1976 selling price. The $788,000
profit amounts to $56,200 return a year, or a 52.6% annual
increase. This average annual appreciation is higher than
most annual household incomes.

   Although the Schenkers are experiencing the effects of a
challenging market, they are not taking a loss. In fact, the
appreciation they will eventually see is an immense increase
over the 1976 selling price.

   Your article made me want to crawl under my desk. Moments
before my Journal arrived, I was on the phone with my wife
attempting to walk her through the fun job of draining the
water bed. Two days ago, it was something else, and now she
tells me my microwave is spitting up blood in its own
electronic throes of death.
   You see, I am in Kentucky -- in our new hometown, and she
is in Massachusetts -- in our still-up-for-sale house. It
long since passed from Home to House, and if this saga
continues much longer, it will be called things you don't
even hear on TV.
   The dream job offer was followed by the full-of-smiles
visit where my wife and I found the perfect vacant lot and
the blueprints that could be changed here and there. Once
back in Massachusetts we found the world's greatest broker,
who could sell igloos in Arizona. We are now on our second
broker.
   One of my aunts, a retired nun, prays for us. My other
aunt and my lovely mother-in-law pray for us. I can't go on
with this letter, as my knuckles are turning white.
   Perhaps, somewhere in this wide world, someone wants my
house on Cape Cod. Sadly, I somehow think the waves at
Wellfleet will be lapping against the Journal's own printing
presses in Chicopee before we find a buyer.

   I am a native of the Northeast, but I have lived in Texas
for nearly 10 years. I've enjoyed the energy boom and then
suffered through the economic downturn and real-estate
collapse along with everyone else in the Southwest. In
particular, I experienced double-digit home-price increases
only to subsequently see the value of my home fall by half.
Given this, it is very difficult for me to have much sympathy
for those individuals such as Frederick and Joyce Schenker
who tried to sell their home for $1.5 million, after having
purchased it in the 1970s for little more than $100,000. Get
real] Greed stopped being fashionable when Ron and Nancy
returned to California.
   As a baby-boomer, I grew up with ever-expanding
expectations. I have learned a very sobering lesson, and I
now realize that if there is to be anything left of this
country to pass on to my children and their generation, then
we as a society must return to the virtues of my
grandparents' generation -- thrift, practicality and
moderation.

   When my home was put up for sale in July 1989, the Realtor
determined the listing price; my suggested price having been
dismissed as too low for consideration. Ten months later it
sold; but only after numerous price reductions and one
kitchen remodeling, all done on my initiative. When I
questioned why the sales price was far below the listing
price, I was sternly told that the original price was
unrealistic. Foolish me.
   Your characterization of Realtors as the reasonable voice
against unrealistic expectations of homeowners can only be
explained by your having gotten your information from
Realtors. Foolish you.
