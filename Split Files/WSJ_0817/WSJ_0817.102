   NEW YORK -- Exxon Corp. said it filed suit against the
U.S. government in a decade-old tax case that, if it loses,
could cost the company $6.5 billion in back taxes.
   The petition, which involves Exxon's income taxes for the
years 1980 through 1982, was filed yesterday in the U.S. Tax
Court in Washington. Exxon expects the litigation to go to
trial sometime next year. The company also said that although
it expects to prevail in court, it has put aside reserves
that it called "adequate" to cover any potential liabilities.

   The major issue, Exxon officials say, involves the pricing
of crude bought from Saudi Arabia from 1980 through 1982. The
oil giant is already in court over a $500 million tax claim
also involving Saudi purchases dating back to 1979. The
petition filed yesterday consolidates the two actions.
   Exxon said that $1.5 billion of the $6.5 billion being
sought by the government for those years reflects the dispute
over the pricing of Saudi oil. Counting the 1979 claim, that
brings the total claims relating to that issue to $2 billion.
   The company said it is resisting another $5 billion in
various other IRS claims for the 1980-82 period, including
attempts to disallow such items as standard depreciation and
foreign tax credits. Exxon said it has supplied the
appropriate documents to support such credits and
depreciation, but said the federal agency is contending it
hasn't had adequate time to complete its review. The audit
started 2 1/2 years ago.
   IRS officials declined to comment on the case, saying they
hadn't seen the petition.
   Between 1979 and 1981, oil prices soared to as high as $40
a barrel on the spot market as a result of the chaos
following the Iranian revolution. The Saudis, partly at the
request of the U.S. government, increased their output and
sold oil at prices below market. Official Saudi selling
prices in the period never broke $34 a barrel.
   The Internal Revenue Service alleges that during those
years, several oil companies made enormous profits buying
such relatively low-priced oil from Saudi Arabia and turning
it into products sold at market prices. The chief
beneficiaries were the U.S. shareholders of the
Saudi-American consortium called Arabian American Oil Co. --
Exxon, Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. The ability
of those companies to buy cheap Saudi crude was referred to
as the "Aramco Advantage" by the industry.
   Exxon, and presumably the others, resold the bulk of the
Saudi oil to U.S. and foreign affiliates at the official
Saudi price, industry sources say. The kingdom wouldn't allow
the companies to reap windfall profits by reselling the oil
at higher market prices. The companies refined the crude and
sold the resulting products at market prices in the U.S. as
well as overseas.
   The four U.S. companies were in a position to profit
greatly from the arrangement through the sale of the refined
products because the crude was costing them less than their
competitors. But Exxon's general tax counsel, William D.
O'Brien, yesterday contested such allegations, saying that
the savings were passed on to consumers. He also said that
appropriate taxes regarding those sales were paid to both
U.S. and foreign governments.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement yesterday
called IRS claims for back taxes "totally unwarranted." He
maintained that Saudi Arabia would have refused to sell the
crude to the oil majors if they had violated its directive
prohibiting them from reselling the oil at the higher market
prices. And consumers in the end would have ended up paying
even higher prices than they did, he said.
   But the IRS has refused to budge. So, Texaco, as well as
Exxon, is currently preparing to go to trial to fight similar
claims by the agency. The IRS claims that Texaco owes about
$1.8 billion in back taxes and interest to the federal
government for the years 1979 through 1981. Neither Mobil nor
Chevron are involved in litigation with the agency at this
time.
