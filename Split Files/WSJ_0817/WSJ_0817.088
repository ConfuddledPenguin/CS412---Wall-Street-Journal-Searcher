   Not since D-Day has an invasion force so awesome been
assembled. We're speaking here, of course, of the
network-anchorman invasion of the Middle East. For days
unconfirmed rumors of an anchorman buildup has fueled
confusion about American television's goals in the Persian
Gulf. Days also passed while the world waited breathlessly to
learn whether Ted Koppel would be allowed into Iraq, and to
figure out where the legions commanded by Dan Rather were
stationed. These concerns have been resolved. Now, with ABC's
Sam Donaldson and NBC's "Sunday Today" co-anchor Garrick
Utley have also been deployed to the front, as has CBS's
"This Morning" anchor Harry Smith. We of course look forward
to their bulletins and interruptions, secure in the knowledge
that Saddam Hussein, the Bully of Baghdad, has more than met
his match.
