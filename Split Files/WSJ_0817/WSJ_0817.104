   OTTAWA -- Key Canadian interest rates fell yesterday
mainly because of the continuing strength of the Canadian
dollar, financial analysts said.
   The Bank of Canada's influential bank rate fell 0.27
percentage point to 13.07%, its lowest level since February.
The bank rate, which has declined for eight consecutive
weeks, is the levy the central bank charges on loans to
financial institutions.

   The drop was followed by a decline in the prime lending
rates of most commercial banks to 14.25% from 14.75%, which
was the first across-the-board prime rate cut since October
1987. The Bank of Montreal lowered its prime rate to 14.25%
earlier this week.
   In a surprise move yesterday, the central bank failed to
resist market pressures to drive three-month treasury bill
rates below the 13.05% level. The bank rate is set each week
at 0.25 percentage point above the average yield on
three-month bills at the Thursday auction.
   Aron Gampel, senior economist with Bank of Nova Scotia,
said the decline in interest rates reflected the continuing
strength of the Canadian dollar, which has been pushed up in
recent weeks to its highest level in 10 years. Mr. Gampel
said the Canadian currency has been buoyed by wide spreads
between comparable Canadian and U.S. short-term interest
rates and by higher oil prices.
   Mr. Gampel said the Bank of Canada has lowered interest
rates in recent weeks to offset the contractionary effect of
a higher Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada has estimated
that a one percentage point rise in the Canadian dollar is
roughly equivalent to a 0.50 percentage point decline in
short-term interest rates.
   The Canadian dollar fell on the interest rate decline,
closing in Toronto at 87.09 U.S. cents, down from 87.44 U.S.
cents on Wednesday.
   The Toronto Stock Exchange composite share index rose 1.91
points to close at 3509.99 yesterday.
   Patti Croft, an economist with the Toronto-based
securities firm Burns Fry Ltd., said the interest rate
decline also reflected, in part, "mounting evidence of
weakness" in the Canadian economy. In May, the most recent
month for which data is available, Canada's gross domestic
product fell 0.2% from the previous month.
   Derek Jones, senior economist with Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce, said yesterday's interest rate decline was
unlikely to prevent the onset of a "mild recession" in
Canada. But Mr. Jones said the cut would "slow the rate of
deterioration in the Canadian economy."
   Analysts predicted that short-term Canadian interest rates
will continue to decline moderately in coming weeks as long
as the Canadian dollar remains firm.
   Bank of Nova Scotia's Mr. Gampel said the central bank
will maintain a "cautious" monetary policy because it is
still concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy,
including recent high wage settlements and higher energy
prices.
   Statistics Canada is to report today Canada's consumer
price index for July. Randall Powley, senior economist with
Scotia-McLeod Inc., estimated that the index rose 0.6% in
July from a month earlier and 4.3% from a year earlier. He
said the year-over-year rate is likely to climb up to the 5%
range in coming months, partly because of higher energy
costs.
   Mr. Powley predicted that Canadian short-term interest
rates will level off later this year as the introduction of
the government's proposed 7% consumption tax approaches. The
new tax, which is to be introduced Jan. 1, if it is approved
by the Canadian Senate, is expected to boost Canada's
consumer price index by a one-time increase of 1.25
percentage points.
