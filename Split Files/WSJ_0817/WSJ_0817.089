   The government's newly announced plan to pump more air
into the nation's automobile tires will hardly make a dent in
the U.S.'s dependence on foreign oil. But some industry
efforts are under way that could gradually replace some of
the crude from the volatile Middle East in the years ahead --
if oil prices remain at or above their current $27-a-barrel
level.
   These include developing more, and more reliable, sources
of domestic and foreign oil, enhanced use of other energy
sources such as natural gas, and developing advanced
technological processes. For example, in New Zealand, Mobil
Corp. has supplied technology to convert natural gas into
gasoline, a process that could possibly make natural gas a
head-to-head competitor with oil should oil prices continue
to rise.

   The government on Wednesday announced an energy plan to
cut the nation's foreign oil dependence by as much as 550,000
barrels a day by year-end, but experts quickly faulted the
plan as insufficient.
   The U.S. now imports more than eight million barrels of
oil a day. A record one-half of all oil used to run industry,
heat homes and fuel cars comes from foreign sources, and
experts see that figure rising to 75% by the end of the
decade. Just yesterday, statistics released by the American
Petroleum Institute showed imports rising by 8.4% in July
from a year ago.
   Oil now accounts for 43% of U.S. energy use, and experts
agree this country will never be able to do without foreign
crude supplies. But it doesn't necessarily have to. The
problem for the '90s and beyond isn't foreign oil per se,
experts say; it is the stability and reliability of those who
supply it -- in particular the handful of nations ringing the
Persian Gulf, where the richest oil reserves on Earth lie.
   Recent events prove that region unreliable, says U.S.
Energy Secretary James Watkins. "This is a tough time for us,
but perhaps out of this crisis will come a better strategy,"
he adds.
   The government is counting on its planned effort to get
car tires inflated properly for savings of about 100,000
barrels of crude oil daily. Other gains would come largely
from enhanced production at domestic wells by some major U.S.
oil companies.
   The Bush administration is resisting any notion of
mounting a major conservation effort, as officials fear
reminding voters of the Carter years, during which President
Carter actually donned a sweater when he turned down the heat
at the White House. In any event, previous efforts at
conservation have proved short-lived.
   Higher taxes on gasoline are also considered politically
impossible, and atomic energy faces widespread public
opposition. Far-fetched alternatives, ranging from electric
cars to windmills, aren't yet economically viable.
   Despite the gloomy forecasts, several efforts show some
potential for lessening U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
                                                                                                       

   Domestic Oil Production
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. is still one of the world's largest oil
producers, with an estimated 27.2 billion barrels of reserves
in the ground. But that's a far cry from 34.2 billion barrels
reached in 1975 as massive oil fields in Alaska's North Slope
were opening up. No major sources of new oil are on the
horizon, and even if one were found, it would probably take
about a decade for a new source to begin large-scale
production.
   Domestic oil production will accelerate somewhat as new,
higher prices justify the very high cost of extracting more
oil from existing wells. Generally, oil producers set a
benchmark of $25 a barrel, or around the current price, to
justify the cost of technology needed to extract the
additional oil. Oil men say that less-expensive, routine
processes leave two-thirds of each potential barrel of oil
behind.
   In the past week, Chevron Corp. ordered a $100 million
increase in domestic spending this year, which it said will
"in a very short time increase the amount of oil flowing from
existing fields."
   But this doesn't have the potential to increase U.S.
output radically. More potential lies in areas not yet
drilled or currently off-limits to oil companies. A
consortium led by Chevron is ready to pump up to 100,000
barrels a day from three new platforms built in a $2.5
billion oil-drilling project off Santa Barbara, Calif. But
the group can't operate because necessary pipeline and tanker
permits have been denied on environmental grounds by local
and state authorities. The Bush administration said earlier
this week it will try to mediate this dispute.
   Major new oil reserves also may lie hidden under the
tundra in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To the
dismay of some both inside and outside the oil industry,
however, exploration there was blocked in the aftermath of
the Exxon Valdez oil spill. "We're willing to risk lives in
the Persian Gulf, but not the lives of caribou in Alaska,"
complains Henry Schuler, an energy security specialist with
the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington,
D.C.
                                                                                                       

   More Foreign Oil
                                                                                                       

   No one is seriously suggesting all foreign oil could be
avoided; the country has been importing vast amounts for
decades and will almost certainly import more from here on,
regardless of domestic gains. But now many oil executives are
evaluating non-traditional foreign suppliers, and a leading
candidate is the Soviet Union.
   It is already the largest oil producer in the world,
pumping about 12 million barrels a day, far more than the
present output of Saudi Arabia. But its exports, which have
generally gone to Eastern Europe, are dwindling; Soviet oil
men have encountered production problems that have cut total
output in each of the past two years. Now, the Soviet Union
is seeking help to redevelop its industry. That, together
with its markedly changed international political role, is
cheering some international oil companies.
   Not long ago, some Soviet oil men visited Houston to
solicit U.S. oil-service companies' help in developing their
fields. Others recently were at Texaco headquarters in White
Plains, N.Y., where an exploration pact was struck four days
ago. Elf-Aquitaine, the big French company with strong U.S.
ties, has agreed to explore one potential Soviet field, and
Chevron is talking with Soviets about another.
   But hopeful U.S. oil men had better "be long on patience
and on time," says Marshall Goldman, a Soviet expert with
Harvard University. Although the huge country is rich in
energy resources -- it has, for instance, 45% of the world's
natural gas reserves -- it lacks the procedural arrangements
necessary to produce and market them efficiently. The system
for extracting resources sometimes lapses into near anarchy.
Despite directives from Moscow, coal miners in the Ukraine in
recent weeks sold some of the coal they were mining directly
to Japanese traders in exchange for Nissan cars they coveted.
   In addition, limited amounts of petroleum may be obtained
in the future from obscure oil-producing countries previously
ignored as too small to matter. Vietnam now is producing
50,000 barrels a day of Bach Ho Crude with the help of
foreign investors and is aiming for 200,000 barrels daily in
two years. Oil industry people also mention Moroccan and
Brazilian oil.
                                                                                                       

   Natural Gas
                                                                                                       

   On paper, at least, no resource offers better hope of
reducing oil use than natural gas. Gas also burns cleaner,
giving it environmental advantages, and it's a more easily
tapped resource than oil.
   Technically, it is easy for utilities and manufacturing
businesses to change the fuel they burn from oil to gas. Many
of these facilities are already capable of fuel-switching and
exercise that ability when gas prices are more attractive
than oil. Natural gas can even be used in cars, after certain
engine modifications and the addition of a compressed-gas
storage tank.
   A big problem, however, is that natural gas is much more
difficult to transport and store than oil. In response to the
current oil crisis, the government is working on ways to
simplify transportation at least, in hopes of encouraging
enough additional substitution to replace 160,000 barrels of
oil a day.
   If oil prices rise far enough, however, the technology
developed by Mobil to turn natural gas directly into gasoline
could become a significant option. The catalyst, found by the
company's researchers 10 years ago, "is magical stuff," a
Mobil official says.
   The alchemy becomes cheaper than standard refining
processes for gasoline after oil hits $36 a barrel, some
industry officials believe. So for now, only one plant in the
world is fitted out to do this. Built in New Zealand in 1985,
it puts out 15,000 barrels a day of gasoline, supplying
one-third of that nation's needs.
   If oil prices go up substantially, "who knows" what the
possibilities are, the Mobil official says.
   Some 4,000 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves lie under
the earth in the U.S., Canada and many other countries,
making gas reserves more plentiful than oil reserves. The
Soviet Union alone has as much untapped natural gas as Saudi
Arabia has in equivalent oil reserves, one expert says. In
the U.S., gas reserves are 165 trillion cubic feet.
   In the past, oil companies searched for oil, and were
dismayed if they found only gas. But that's changing.
Already, Amoco Corp. is more of a gas producer than an oil
producer.
                                                                                                       

   Conservation
                                                                                                       

   Conservation has flagged since oil prices crashed in the
mid-1980s, but built-in efficiencies such as more home
insulation and fuel-efficient cars remain.
   More gains can be realized. While experts are reluctant to
make exact predictions, they say that historically, a 10%
rise in fuel prices causes a 2% decrease in consumption. Oil
prices have risen more than 27% since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   "We have the potential to save a lot of energy overnight
by simply altering behavioral responses; we estimate that as
much as 30% of the energy decline following the last crisis
was attributable to people changing their habits," says
Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates.
   For instance, motorists are driving an average of 1,000
miles a year more now than in 1980. And they're doing it in
cars that in the past two years have gotten 7% heavier, 10%
more powerful and half a mile per gallon less fuel-efficient.
This alone is using an added 200,000 barrels of oil a day.
   Another form of conservation is cogeneration, or the
process in which some industrial plants can generate
electricity at the same time they are burning a fuel such as
coal, gas or oil. The plants then generally sell this
electricity to utility companies.
   Less than 5% of electricity is produced through
cogeneration, but its use is growing. Theoretically,
cogeneration should conserve energy because it makes a
twofold use of one energy source. But in practice that
doesn't necessarily happen. Cogeneration can consume more oil
and gas, contends Michael Gluckman, technical director of
Electric Power Research Institute, because many cogeneration
plants run on those fuels, and the power they produce often
replaces power from utility plants that burn coal.
                                                                                                       

   Coal
                                                                                                       

   Coal supplies in the U.S. are huge. Using technology
available today, 268 billion tons are recoverable. That's
enough at current consumption rates to last almost three
centuries.
   Unfortunately, opportunities to replace oil with coal over
the near-term aren't plentiful. For one thing, tightening
environmental restrictions are making it more difficult to
use coal, a dirtier-burning fuel than either oil or gas. And
following the energy crises of the '70s, many utilities and
manufacturing plants have already converted to coal.
   Today, 57% of the nation's electricity needs are supplied
by coal. Oil ranks behind nuclear, natural gas and hydro
power, controlling less than 5% of the utility market.
   Unless crude-oil prices stay above $25 a barrel for a
protracted period or severe supply disruptions occur, there
probably will be little incentive for facilities still using
oil to switch to coal. "It would take a year of high oil
prices," says Daniel Gerkin, a senior vice president of the
National Coal Association.
   Although oil is the fuel of choice in the transportation
sector, there has been some experimentation with coal. A coal
and oil slurry has potential as a fuel for barges and
railroads. And in South Africa, where oil for political
reasons has been embargoed for years, gasoline is made from
coal. But Mr. Gerkin points out that the government there
subsidizes that production. Gasoline from coal wouldn't be
economic in the U.S. unless oil prices increased to well over
$35 a barrel.
                                                                                                       

   Unconventional Fuels

   Crude oil made from tar sands is one of the most promising
alternative fuels. Oil-laden earth is currently being turned
into 60,000 barrels of high-quality synthetic crude a day in
the northern reaches of Alberta, Canada, by Suncor Inc., a
unit of Sun Co. of Philadelphia. Five miles down the road,
Syncrude Canada Ltd., partly owned by Imperial Oil, an
Exxon-controlled Canadian company, has production three times
that of Suncor.
   The sands are essentially mined, with a giant bucket-wheel
ripping tons of the tarry earth from mountainsides. The earth
is then processed into crude that in turn is refined into
motor fuel or heating oil.
   Suncor officials admit that it takes oil prices of at
least $25 a barrel to make their process commercially viable.
But an estimated 300 billion barrels of recoverable oil lies
under the giant Athabasca tar sands. So Suncor, which has
manufactured its synthetic oil there since 1967, believes it
will realize "an adequate return" over the long term.
   Venezuela creates a slightly different product, a
super-heavy crude, from its Orinoco Belt. The material is so
dense that without the addition of water, it's almost
impossible to transport. But currently 15,000 barrels a day
of this gunk is being turned into a slurry and exported. OPEC
doesn't even count it against Venezuela's oil-output quota,
though by 1995 Venezuela could be producing by some estimates
400,000 barrels a day of this oil. Germany and the U.K.
import some of the viscous product, and a utility in downtown
London burns it without further processing.
   Synthetic fuels still must live down past failures.
Creation of an entire $88 billion synthetic fuels industry,
as tried by the Carter administration, should never have been
attempted, says John Sawhill, the former deputy energy
secretary who headed up the project. "Synfuels Corp. was just
too big. We were required to spend too much money too
quickly," he says.
   Of 150 proposals examined, only a handful ever got
started. The largest of those were coal gasification and
oil-shale extraction projects. None would be commercially
feasible if constructed today. Some of the oil-shale plants
were particularly troublesome; at one built by Unocal Corp.
in Parachute Creek, Colo., systems became so gummed with
shale waste that jackhammers were needed to clean them out.
Moreover, by today's environmental standards, shale plants
would be highly undesirable.
   The first project funded by Synfuels, a coal gasification
plant in Southern California that turns coal into gas, seems
to have been one of the more beneficial. Until its recent
closure, it was providing enough power to a nearby electric
grid to light 100,000 homes in Los Angeles. Texaco recently
purchased it and will put it back into operation by 1992. But
then it will be used to burn coal and sewage sludge from Los
Angeles.
