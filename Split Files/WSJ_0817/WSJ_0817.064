   BRUSSELS -- For Western Europe's car makers, it could have
been worse. With car sales already slack and Japanese
competition on the rise, the last thing these manufacturers
needed was an oil crisis.
   But the standoff in the Mideast so far hasn't led to the
shortages or lines at the gasoline pumps seen during the oil
shocks of 1973 and 1979. And, assuming the situation doesn't
take a turn for the worse, car makers in Europe don't expect
it to have a serious impact on their sales.

   "The reaction of the public to what happens in the
{Persian} Gulf is much more rational now than in the 1970s,"
says Richard Gaul of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. "People
just don't seem frightened" by the current showdown over
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait early this month.
   If Western Europe generally is facing the situation with
serenity, that may be because its cars -- and its entire
economy -- use fuel more efficiently than the U.S. does. "The
basic issue is who uses energy most efficiently," says Krafft
Holtz of Euroeconomics, a London-based forecasting and
management consulting firm. "And the answer is Europe."
   While the U.S. reverted to some of its gas-guzzling habits
during the Reagan years after a period of energy
conservation, many European nations moved vigorously to cut
oil consumption. France, for instance, used oil to supply 69%
of its energy needs in 1979. Thanks in large part to
extensive use of nuclear energy, that figure today is less
than 40%.
   In addition, gasoline prices in most of Europe are already
so high that an increase of a few pfennigs or centimes won't
make much difference, analysts say. Peter Bogin, an American
who works with Cambridge Energy Associates in Paris, says:
"Gas already costs $4 a gallon in France. If it costs $4.50,
that won't stop people from buying a car. In America,
however, it could prove the last blow which pushes the
country into a recession."
   Another advantage for Europe is the decline in the value
of the dollar. Because oil is generally priced and traded in
dollars, the U.S. currency's weakness partly offsets the
price rises for Europeans.
   However, if the gulf standoff stretches into a
debilitating long-term affair or breaks into open war,
economists and analysts say higher energy costs would cut
into company profits and could force European central banks
to raise interest rates to control inflation.
   That could hit the European car industry particularly
hard. Steven Reitman, an auto analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
says its market already had shrunk slightly in the first
seven months of 1990. Auto makers were counting on the
opening up of Eastern Europe to give them a long-term boost.
   Almost all the major European manufacturers had announced
joint ventures in recent months, either to take over existing
factories or to build new ones in Eastern Europe. But that
region's former insulation from oil price rises is ending
with its supply of subsidized Soviet oil, and the new Mideast
shock will add to its problems.
   "The companies were expanding to meet anticipated demand
in Eastern Europe, where rates of car registration are low
and there is a huge unsatisfied demand," Mr. Reitman says.
"But the oil shock will force them to revise these
capital-spending plans."
