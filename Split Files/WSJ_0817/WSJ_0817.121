   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. said that William F. Farah
and Charles C. Wood were removed by shareholders from the
company's board.
   The apparel maker said that 75% of the shares represented
in a shareholders' meeting last Friday, and 55% of all shares
outstanding, voted to remove the two men.

   Mr. Farah started the proxy battle over the membership of
the board by demanding that the other seven of the company's
nine board members be ousted. The company countered with a
proposal that Mr. Farah and Mr. Wood be removed.
   The result marks the end of Mr. Farah's 53-year career at
the company founded by his parents. As reported in a page-one
story in The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Farah's
25-year reign as chief executive officer was tumultuous, as
the former chairman outlasted several potential successors
and survived an earlier ouster.
   A company statement said, "Now that this special
shareholders' meeting is behind us, management and the board
can look to the future and concentrate on returning the
company to profitability."
   Last week, the company projected it would report a
third-quarter loss in about two weeks. For the six months
ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of $2 million, or 32
cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.
