   LONDON -- Shares in Reuters Holdings PLC were hit by
reports of snags in the upgraded version of the company's
Dealing 2000 system, a communications network for
foreign-exchange markets.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters stock fell 7.9%, while
American depositary receipts plunged 11% to $51.375 in
national over-the-counter trading in New York. The sell-off
was prompted by a negative research report by Wertheim
Schroder, a New York investment firm. The firm reportedly
took Reuters off its list of recommended stocks, citing
problems with Dealing 2000-2.

   Wertheim refused to provide copies of its report or to
discuss its message.
   Also, Trading Systems Technology, an industry newsletter,
said in a recent edition that Reuters was having testing
problems with the new system.
   The system, which represents a major investment and a
potentially significant source of profits, will allow
foreign-exchange dealers to communicate with as many as four
parties via computer terminals. Dealers could also enter bids
and offers, which the system would match up.
   In London, the company dismissed reports that the Dealing
2000-2 project is having problems, though it said that
"further testing is required on peripheral systems and
overall system integration."
   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal,
owns Telerate Inc., which, among other things, competes with
Reuters in the electronic currency trading market.
