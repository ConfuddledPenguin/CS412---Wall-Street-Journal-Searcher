   INTERSTATE 271, Ohio -- Just a decade ago, an oil shock
and looming recession could have knocked Ohio on its back.
   But this is a different Ohio. Here in the industrial
heartland, industry has a new look.

<TEXT>
   Smokestacks are nowhere to be found. Instead, the scene
along this manufacturing artery east of Cleveland is one of
endless suburban sprawl: smokeless industrial parks, as
ubiquitous as the McDonald's arches that surround them.
   And while there is obviously concern about the crisis in
the Persian Gulf, there has been little disruption of the
industry that goes on here behind neatly manicured lawns.
"Ohio is a lot more resilient than it once was," says Ronald
M. Rebner, chief financial officer of Keithley Instruments
Inc. Barring war in the Middle East, he says, his company and
others "will just absorb the higher oil costs and keep
marching forward."
   Randall W. Eberts, an economist at the Cleveland Federal
Reserve Bank, says that's not just bluster. "Manufacturing
has come roaring back," he says, and because of sharply
higher productivity, the new manufacturing jobs "may prove
more secure in the next recession than the ones they
replaced."
   Ohio's new industrial landscape is a good example of a
growing kind of American industry that relies more on
efficiency, creativity and pluck than oil and a surging U.S.
economy. And Keithley Instruments, just off I-271 in nearby
Solon, is a good place to start a driving tour of that
landscape.
   The company, which makes equipment used in laboratories to
measure electric current, has raised its manufacturing
productivity 50% in the past three years by attacking the way
it designs products.
   Design and production engineers, who once ignored each
other, now work together in teams, simultaneously designing a
product and the process to make it. One result: The 36
fasteners that assembly-line workers once had to screw in or
bolt to one product have been slashed to two.
   Mr. Rebner motions to the window in his ground-floor
office and the pretty lawn beyond. "How we've been able to
shift from all those people who used to work in the steel
mills to this I don't know," he says. "But there's no way
this is the Rust Belt."
   Keithley is one of hundreds of companies that have sprung
up along I-271 and the highways crisscrossing it around
Cleveland. Like their industrial forefathers, these newcomers
still manufacture goods. But it's manufacturing that bears
little resemblance to the gritty smokestack version of
yesteryear.
   The scale is smaller. Energy consumption is largely
limited to the electricity used to heat and light buildings.
Exports play a big role. The products themselves have a
higher technology content and fill a niche rather than garden
variety metal bending or nuts and bolts. And many of these
new manufacturers are highly prosperous.
   While parts of the nation teeter near recession, Ohio's
economy chugs along. The state is the only one in the
industrial Midwest that still expects 2% or better job growth
this year. The revival of manufacturing is a major reason
why.
   Plenty of problems must still be overcome before Ohio
becomes a manufacturing paradise. The state ranks 39th in the
nation in the availability of private venture capital, Mr.
Eberts says. Worker wages stand 15% above the national
average (though less than the 20% premium paid in 1983). And
while workers are skilled and plentiful, they're not terribly
well educated: Only 17% of household heads have college
degrees, putting Ohio near the bottom in attained higher
education.
   But already, there are other statistics that tell a
remarkable story. Between 1979 and 1982, Ohio lost 27% of its
manufacturing employment. In all, 372,000 jobs vanished as
factories padlocked their gates and companies pulled up
stakes for sunnier climes. In January 1983, when Ohio's
jobless rate peaked at 14.2%, the state looked like a goner.
   Today, joblessness stands at 5.1%, less than in California
and below the national average. Of course, services have
accounted for most of the job growth: In 1989, in fact,
services for the first time surpassed manufacturing as Ohio's
leading job sector. Still, manufacturing has posted a net
gain of about 100,000 jobs since January 1983.
   By contrast, manufacturing employment has continued to
slide in New York and Pennsylvania, which together have lost
an additional 239,000 such jobs since 1982. Ohio now accounts
for more manufactured goods than any other state except
California and New York, having passed Pennsylvania in the
past decade.
   Economists and executives offer several explanations for
Ohio's resurgent manufacturing. Some cite declines in worker
wages and higher productivity gains than in neighboring
states. Others attribute it to a favorable political
environment that has helped attract and nurture new
businesses.
   In truth, Ohio's strength may stem from more subtle
factors: Its diverse manufacturing base, covering a wide
range of soft and hard goods, as well as its critical mass in
some emerging sectors, such as surgical and medical
equipment.
   Whatever the reason, technology-based companies say it's
now easier to do business in Ohio. "Five years ago, I had to
go to Silicon Valley to get the technology I needed. Now,
everything is available locally," says entrepreneur Albert P.
Kretz Jr. His firm, Synthetic Blood &amp; Medical Technologies
Inc. of Highland Heights, another town along I-271, expects
this fall to begin producing a tiny, automated
insulin-injecting pump for diabetics.
   Labor, too, is readily available. In some cases, older
executives who weren't wanted at big corporations anymore
have been welcomed at small companies just starting out.
   That was the case at a firm founded by Howard J.
Drechsler, a pharmacist who had experimented for years with
light sources to treat skin disease. Finally, in 1981, he
told his wife he wanted to stop filling prescriptions and
start selling his own products. "She thought I was nuts,"
says Mr. Drechsler, now 58.
   Nine years later, the entrepreneur and two cousins have
parlayed their $6,000 investment -- and $101,000 in seed
money from Ohio -- into National Biological Corp., a $3
million-a-year business that has sold its products to
customers as far away as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   Though shipments to the Middle East have been temporarily
suspended, Mr. Drechsler says that's a minor concern. And the
6% increase he expects in transportation costs stemming from
the Iraqi invasion pales in comparison with a 32% surge in
health-insurance costs for the company's 26 employees, he
says. "That's the real crisis," he quips.
   The company, in Twinsburg on an offshoot of I-271, makes
ultraviolet lamps used mainly to treat psoriasis. It is the
last in a long row of new businesses on Enterprise Parkway.
   The company struggled at first. Then, in 1983, it got a
big break when Mr. Drechsler hired Elton T. Leppelmeier, one
of the nation's leading ultraviolet-light experts. "He wrote
the book on this kind of therapy," Mr. Drechsler says. "For a
small company like us, just starting out, to get a guy of his
stature was a huge boost."
   Mr. Leppelmeier says he got the "silver bullet" from
General Electric Co., where he had worked for nearly 40 years
as a senior engineer in GE's Cleveland-based lighting
division. Now nearly 65 and chief of product development for
National Biological, Mr. Leppelmeier says he has no plans to
retire. "Why should I? Just because GE had no use for me
doesn't mean I can't make a contribution somewhere else," he
says.
   Getting the most out of people is the top priority at
Automated Packaging Systems Inc., just around the corner from
National Biological in Twinsburg. Founded in 1962 by brothers
Hershey and Bernard Lerner, the company was chased by zoning
inspectors from its first production site -- the family
garage -- in the Queens borough of New York City. Then it was
on to Brooklyn. About a decade later, the company settled in
Twinsburg, the first tenant in an industrial park that now
stretches for miles.
   Today, Automated Packaging Systems is a global player in
the world packaging business. It makes machines that print
labels and package everything from soft-drink containers to
plastic bags. Annual sales total about $80 million. But,
despite its size, Automated still manages to retain a
personal touch with its 650 employees.
   The atmosphere is relaxed, the banter frequent. When
Chairman Hershey strolls through the factory floor, employees
call out, "Hey, Hersh, how ya' doin'?" The company phone book
alphabetizes people by their first names. The brothers
regularly attend funerals and weddings. And the perks of
employment at Automated include free use for all employees of
the company cottage at a lakeside resort in central Ohio.
   More than half of the employees are involved in voluntary
quality circles meant to improve productivity and product
quality. Recently, one seven-person team tackled a problem
that had vexed Automated for years: the time lost setting up
machinery for a new production run. The process typically
took more than an hour. After filming and studying it for
several months, the team whittled the time to 15 minutes.
   Hershey says he felt like a proud father when the group
presented its findings to management. "They did a terrific
job," he says, beaming. The team has begun to teach other
workers the new system.
   There is no union at Automated. "If you feel treated
unjustly, you can walk right into Hershey's office and he'll
listen to your complaint," says Brian Ripley, who packs
freight on the shipping dock and has five relatives working
at Automated. "When you have direct access to the chairman,
who needs a union?"
   Automated tries mightily to promote loyalty, eschewing
layoffs and almost always promoting from within. And loyalty
is returned: The company's first hire in Brooklyn, Vinnie
Lattur, still works on the shop floor.
   Automated has also cultivated loyalty with its suppliers.
It has bought plastic resin -- an essential ingredient of the
labels it makes -- from the same suppliers since its
beginnings even when others were offering cheaper
alternatives. That's a policy that will guarantee Automated
supplies, Hershey Lerner says, even if hostilities in the
Middle East trigger shortages of oil and, ultimately,
oil-derived resin.
   Just around the corner from Keithley Instruments in Solon
is another sleek manufacturing compound. The company, Tecmar,
sits on Solon's main thoroughfare, Cochran Road, an
industrial artery lined for miles on either side with new
buildings and businesses.
   Hank Oberle, the tanned and blond operations vice
president, looks as if he had been transplanted from
California. He's dressed in a white shirt, open at the
collar, and khaki slacks. But his approach to manufacturing
is hardly laid back. Since he took charge of production five
years ago, Tecmar, which makes equipment that stores computer
data on tape as a backup to the hard disk, has slashed its
manufacturing employment from 380 to 103.
   "We automate everything we can," says Mr. Oberle, who left
Eaton Corp., a diversified truck-parts maker in Cleveland,
because of what he felt was the insufficient priority given
manufacturing.
   Like many of the companies along I-271, Tecmar suggests
how ever-declining technology costs have put some of the best
manufacturing methods and equipment within the reach of small
players. State-of-the-art circuit boards get minted at a rate
of one every two minutes, output approaching the best world
standards.
   Even with the hostilities in the Middle East, the company
expects at least 20% growth next year. "We're planning to
expand aggressively," says Mark A. Bretl, Tecmar's
31-year-old president.
   Of course, small-scale manufacturing can be a
disadvantage. Small production runs mean higher per-unit
costs. But some companies sprouting up along I-271 have
figured out ways to combat that, too.
   A final stop at Iotech Inc., west of Solon in Bedford
Heights, is a case in point. Founded three years ago by
entrepreneur Thomas DeSantis, the company, which makes
devices that link computers to scientific instruments, has
averaged about 80% growth each year. But even with sales this
year of nearly $10 million, it's still a relative midget in
manufacturing. While Keithley or Tecmar stamp out thousands
of the same circuit boards, 500 is considered a long
production run at Iotech.
   So Iotech farms out part of its production, bringing new
meaning to the phrase cottage industry. It employs about a
dozen part-time workers who put together its circuit boards.
The workers pick up their kits, stocked with all the
necessary gadgetry, assemble 25 or so at their own pace and
bring them back for a refill.
   "I like it a lot," says Joyce Mays, inspecting the parts
in her refill kit. The mother of three, who once worked on an
electronics assembly line, figures she nets about $4 an hour.
More important, she says, "I can set my own hours." In her
case, the production line -- her kitchen -- usually doesn't
get cranked up until the children have gone to bed.
   Mr. DeSantis says the quality of the farmed-out circuit
boards is top-notch. And Iotech reaps big benefits. The main
one is that it saves capital, allowing it to spend more on
development and marketing.
   There's no recession in Iotech's future, Mr. DeSantis
insists. Already, he says, August is shaping up as the
company's best month ever, with the little firm shipping its
products to customers world-wide. About one-third of Iotech's
products go overseas, mostly to Western Europe.
   "We're small, so we have to be smarter, more creative. We
have to spend our money more wisely," he says. "That's the
only way we can hope to compete."
