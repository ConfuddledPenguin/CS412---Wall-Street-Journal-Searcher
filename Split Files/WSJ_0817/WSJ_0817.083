   Imagine a corps of 500 dedicated college graduates, most
fresh out of one of the 100 top campuses from which recruits
were actively sought. They've endured eight weeks of boot
camp and now are about to begin a two-year hitch of
hand-to-hand combat.
   Such is the situation facing the members of Teach for
America in their war against the entrenched education
bureaucracy for the hearts -- and more important, the minds
-- of our nation's neediest schoolchildren.

   These young men and women are the vanguard of a new
movement that, using the Peace Corps model, aims to build a
national teacher corps of outstanding, committed individuals
to, as the press kit puts it, "teach America's future." It
has received largely glowing media attention in recent
months, with the New York Times setting the tone in a May 31
editorial: "Amid all the gale-force commencement wind, some
members of the Class of '90 already know that they can make a
living and make a difference."
   But this small, brave contingent is entering a battlefield
already strewn with casualties. After nearly a decade of
reform, our school systems are still failing to educate many
of America's children. American scholastic achievement ranks
low, and teacher morale lower. Many are calling for a
revolutionary change in tactics -- beyond that of sending in
fresh troops -- to rescue American schools from the education
bureaucracy that has held them hostage for so long. Even
though the Teach for America corps members stayed clear of
the ed-school enemy camp as undergrads, what former Education
Secretary William Bennett has called "the Blob" may already
have them in its sights.
   Teach for America's young general, Wendy Kopp, is an
inspiring leader. The 23-year-old outlined her plans for the
organization in her senior thesis at Princeton University in
1989; secured corporate and foundation grants, now totaling
more than $2 million; set up a staff and a recruitment drive,
and saw the corps members, staffers, and 50 members of the
summer faculty come together in Los Angeles for the Summer
Institute, as teacher bootcamp is called.
   Ms. Kopp's aim is fine. As she said in a recent interview,
one week before the end of the Summer Institute: "Just as
companies depend on the quality of their workforce, schools
depend on the quality and creativity and intellectual drive
of the individuals who staff the schools. And they also
depend on the extent to which the nation's leaders also have
a commitment to and experience with the nation's schools."
   But the education bureaucracy -- the enemy -- tends to
dictate the course of the war. For example, Teach for America
has to play by the alternative-certification rules in Los
Angeles, New York, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and rural
North Carolina and Georgia, the areas it will serve this
school year.
   The rules dictate that members be sent only into those
school districts with persistent teacher shortages. While
this may help the corps' sense of mission, it also means that
the newly minted teachers, most with only five weeks of
mostly half-day student teaching under their belts, will be
sent into places where few teachers want to stay -- often not
because of the race or socioeconomic group of the student
body, but because of an incompetent principal, a balky
custodian, overcrowding or other problems. (New York's
District 4 in East Harlem, which offers a school-choice plan
within its borders, has no trouble retaining teachers.)
   Some have criticized the fact that only 45% of the corps
plans to stay in teaching after the two-year stint is up,
charging dilletantism. But that ignores the real problem. The
average corps member is about 23 years old and has little
work experience of any kind. If she finds she loves teaching,
can close her classroom door and get on with her job, she may
decide against a career in investment banking or the law. But
even those who now plan to spend a lifetime teaching will go
AWOL if they enter a school in which learning is a very low
priority and find that idealism, intelligence and an
understanding of cultural differences can go only so far in a
poisoned, bureaucratic atmosphere. Perhaps Ms. Kopp's model
should have been not the Peace Corps but the Green Berets.
   Instead, corps members this summer received instruction
from a condensed version of the revised standard ed-school
bible, presented in a somewhat more flexible, responsive way
by a faculty of teachers and education professors recruited
from a pool of 500 applicants. "Multiculturalism," the latest
ed-school darling, was one of the three major themes at the
institute, along with "professionalism" and "reflection."
(There are worse things than eight weeks of education classes
-- try a few years of them.)
   Although Teach for America's leaders made much of the wide
range of views represented in its guest lecture series, they
seemed to have acquired the education monopoly's narrow
definition of range. The students heard no prominent reformer
outside the education establishment's mainstream.
   Particularly troubling was the lack of attention paid to
the school-choice movement, which apparently didn't get a
hearing. Not one of the many prominent choice proponents
spoke to the corps. One wonders if corps members have even
heard of John Chubb, of the liberal Brookings Institution,
whose new book on public-school choice showed that choice now
has wide appeal across the political spectrum. Or Polly
Williams, whose fight for school vouchers in inner-city
Milwaukee belies the stereotype that only white, middleclass
parents support choice.
   Also troubling were the rote recitations of the
education-establishment catechism heard from corps and staff:
bilingual education is good; teacher pay is much lower than
that of other college graduates; schools need more money;
multiculturalism -- a revamping of the curriculum to more
fully include non-Western cultures -- will increase student
involvement, self-esteem, tolerance and achievement.
   Corps members didn't hear Linda Chavez, former director of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, who could counter claims
of bilingualism's efficacy. Or Emily Feistritzer, director of
the National Center for Education Information, who challenges
some of the conventional wisdom on teacher shortages and
teacher pay. Or sociologist James Coleman, who has examined
what makes parochial schools work. Or one of the many
researchers over the years who have countered the common
wisdom that class size, expenditures per pupil and teacher
pay are major factors in student achievement.
   It might even have been beneficial for corps members, who
were presented with rather benign strains of the
multiculturalist theory, to have heard black-supremacist
Leonard Jeffries of City College or other members of New York
state's Task Force on Minorities to see to what extreme,
unicultural ends the theory can be taken.
   Is the corps marching off totally defenseless, then? No,
there are some glimmers of hope.
   Student teaching in the year-round schools of Los Angeles
was probably the most helpful component of the summer
session. Useful too were the small-group "mentoring
sessions," led twice weekly by the summer faculty, which gave
corps members nitty-gritty advice on real teaching problems,
such as ways to deal with school-system red tape.
   The student teaching was an eye-opener for some of the
corps members, as they found that theory and practice are two
different things. This should ease the shock of full-time
teaching. Most worked with good classroom teachers in the Los
Angeles schools to which they were assigned -- a definite
plus. Others worked with incompetents, an education in
itself. (Corps members will be assigned mentors in their new
schools.)
   And Teach for America is revamping the Summer Institute,
based on what was learned this first summer. It wouldn't be
fair to deem the war lost when the first battle is about to
begin.
   Teach for America is aware of the roadblocks its corps
members will face. It is hoping that an esprit de corps
developed over the summer, and is trying to arrange it so
that no member in an urban placement is in a school without a
fellow member there for moral support. In addition, in New
York City, for example, two full-time regional directors will
put out a newsletter and run support workshops -- every week
for the first month and every other week until January. After
that, the schedule will be re-evaluated. The teacher corps
also hopes to set up educational workshops over the course of
the year.
   But the best hope for Teach for America lies with the
troops, who are a bright, able bunch. If given half a chance,
they may be able to use their own resources to navigate
around the education mine fields and do what they want to do
above all else -- teach. And if they fail in this aim, they
may yet succeed in Ms. Kopp's second goal. Battle-weary and
scarred, home from the war, they may become the strongest
proponents of true education reform.
