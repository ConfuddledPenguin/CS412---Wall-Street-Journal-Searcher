   Those still harboring hopes for a healthy and prosperous
future for the National Endowment for the Arts -- and their
numbers are getting fewer -- have less and less reason for
cheer, what with the latest revelations about the log rolling
in the grants process going on at the Endowment. More about
that in a moment. Nor could they have taken much
encouragement from a meeting of the NEA advisory council,
recently convened in Washington to discuss rejected artists,
the specter of government censorship and similar topics dear
to the heart of the arts and grants industry.
   The ensuing three-day fiesta of hand-wringing testimonials
to the sanctity of art and various related sermons and
denunciations amply illustrated why the NEA has come under so
much scrutiny lately. Advisory council member Harvey
Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
charged that the 297 Congressmen who recently voted against
funding the public exhibition of a work displaying
representations of the female sex organs, had been motivated
by homophobia. Other members of the advisory council bitterly
denounced the NEA's refusal to award grants to Holly Hughes
and Karen Finley, both sexually explicit performers. One
speaker was particularly outraged over the agency's failure
to appreciate the art of Ms. Finley, known for on-stage
performances in which she smears chocolate and bean sprouts
over her mostly naked body while inveighing against various
forms of political and social repression in this country.

   But in the midst of their struggles to defend art against
the Philistine hordes, the council members also found time to
acknowledge that the NEA has developed an image problem over
conflict of interest charges. We suspect this is the ticking
time bomb most likely to blow apart the entire NEA
enterprise.
   The fact that NEA judges sit on the very panels that make
grants to their own organizations has long been something of
an inside joke within the arts-grants community. The manager
of the San Francisco Opera, for example, sat on the panels
that awarded grants of $175,000 and $27,000 to none other
than the San Francisco Opera. The director of Philadelphia's
Institute of Contemporary Art sat on the panels that gave
grants totaling $155,000 to Philadelphia's Institute of
Contemporary Art. The curator of the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in New York sat on the panel that gave
$97,000 in grants to the New Museum of Contemporary Art. And
so on.
   A spokesman for the Endowment told us that panel members
were always careful to leave the room when their
institutions's grants were about to be voted on. Those who
know the way the NEA panels work scoff. Absent members know
full well that they can depend on colleagues and the favor
exchange that operates among the panelists.
   At its meeting, the NEA advisory council postponed voting
funds for Karen Finley and Holly Hughes only because of the
appearance of conflict of interest charges. Both these
performers were asking funds for projects directly involving
panel members who were to vote on the funding. Their grants
are to be submitted to a new panel, to meet in November,
safely after the time Congress makes its decision on
re-authorizing the Endowment.
   Still, we can be grateful that the NEA's advisors have
seen fit to concern themselves with at least this aspect of
the Endowment's credibility problem. Cooperative
back-scratching that prevents equitable distribution of
grants has after all a lot to do with the issue of fair play
for artists. Perhaps the arts community now busy
demonstrating around the country with "art ambulances,"
symbolic coffins and freedom of expression caravans to garner
support for the NEA will find a minute to take note of that
fact. Surely, there is something improper about the manner in
which the "arts community" has kept these public funds
circulating in a narrow circle of like-minded artists with
well-placed friends.
