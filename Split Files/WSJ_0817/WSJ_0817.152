   Tokyo stocks posted steep losses amid futures-linked
selling, correcting after Wednesday's huge advance, traders
said.
   In London, meanwhile, shares finished lower, jostled by
what appeared to be mounting tensions in the Middle East.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 562.68 points to
27549.44 Thursday following Wednesday's surge of 1439.59
points.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index plummeted another 870.59
points to close the morning session at 26678.85.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
300 million shares, down from 458.4 million shares Wednesday.
Losers outpaced winners 618 to 283, while 166 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 32.13 points, or 1.53%, to 2067.36.
   The second section index added 12.96 points, or 0.32%, to
4113.67. Volume in the section was estimated at 14.7 million
shares, up from 11.9 million shares Wednesday.
   Observers said a correction had been expected, as factors
such as uncertainty about the Middle East conflict and
fundamental weakness haven't changed.
   Stephen Leist, manager of equity sales at S.G. Warburg
Securities (Japan) Inc., said that despite Wednesday's
massive upward move, Persian Gulf developments remain a focus
of concern. But even if a diplomatic solution is reached, he
noted, the market still suffers from valuation problems.
   Mr. Leist added the recent strength of the yen, which has
firmed as the dollar hasn't proved to be anyone's safe haven,
is one of the few favorable factors for the market. But the
yen's rise hasn't been stellar, providing only underlying
support rather than an incentive for buying.
   Interest-rate worries, in part linked to higher oil
prices, and persistent evidence that the U.S. economy is
slowing, continue to discourage investors from returning to
the market, traders said.
   "Investors just aren't interested in equity right now,"
said Isao Takahashi, trader at James Capel Pacific Ltd. "Most
investors are waiting for the {Nikkei index} to come back to
30000 points. Without that, they're not going to be active in
equity."
   This week's Japanese "O-Bon" festival season has
contributed to the market's thinner activity, although
traders said they doubt that volume will pick up when
holidays are over.
   Trading will likely be thin and volatile Friday as well,
traders predicted.
   With hardly any retail activity, futures and
options-linked trading has led market movement. Thursday,
futures were sold off early in the morning to a discount
level to the cash indexes.
   Sentiment that futures had been driven too high over
recent days, bought higher partly on the notion that they
were oversold, led to the selling, participants said.
   At least one of the Big Four domestic firms was seen
buying selectively Thursday, giving support to shares such as
TDK, up 130 yen to 6750 yen (88 cents to $45.76). Advantest
rose 270 yen to 5950 yen.
   Moreover, traders said speculative groups were testing
their chances by buying shares such as Kuraray, up 10 yen to
1340 yen, and Kurabo, up 70 yen to 1390 yen.
   Oil shares surged again, led by Teikoku Oil, up 50 yen to
1540 yen, and Nippon Oil, up 40 yen to 1320 yen.
   Electric power shares were down. Tokyo Electric Power fell
90 yen to 3500 yen, Chubu Electric Power fell 110 yen to 2880
yen, and Kansai Electric Power dropped 90 yen to 2900 yen.
   Shares of securities companies were lower. Nomura fell 80
yen to 1850 yen, Nikko dropped 20 yen to 1020 yen, Daiwa
dropped 60 yen to 1180 yen, and Yamaichi fell 50 yen to 1010
yen.
   Also hit hard were high-tech shares, including Sony, down
230 yen to 7850 yen, Pioneer, down 110 yen to 5550 yen, and
Kyocera, down 180 yen to 8000 yen.
   Throughout most of the session in London, shares drifted
without much investor interest as participants flattened out
positions for the slow summer season. And amid the current
climate of confusion in world equity markets, dealers said
participants couldn't find much justification to invest anew
in the market.
   Also, several developments from the Persian Gulf,
including news that Britons and Americans held in Kuwait were
being rounded up and taken to an unspecified hotel, as well
as remarks from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, set investors
clearly on edge.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
17.2 points to 2222.1, just above the day's low of 2220.8.
The Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 23.30 points to
1724.9. Volume was 375.4 million shares, down from 563.6
million issues Wednesday, when trading was inflated by
Imperial Chemical Industries' sale of its 232 million
Enterprise Oil shares.
   "We've seen relative calm in world markets for the last
couple of days but it looks like that's all been shattered
now," said one market watcher. "Wall Street is sliding and
we're dropping right along with it."
   Another commentator said the market retreated on "nervous
pressure," as the scenario of "comment and counter-comment"
from developments in the Middle East gripped the market. "The
key is whether all this talk will actually lead to anything,"
he said.
   The sharpest drop on the day was Reuters Holdings, which
slumped 80 pence to 929 pence ($1.52 to $17.65). The shares
were sold after U.S. brokerage firm Wertheim Schroder
downgraded the stock and removed it from a recommended buy
list. A total of 5.2 million shares were traded in London.
   Royal Insurance fell 17 pence to 433 pence after reporting
a half-year pretax loss of #65 million. Other composite
insurers fell in sympathy, with Commercial Union falling 12
pence to 487 pence, General Accident slipping 8 pence to 497
pence, and Guardian Royal edging down 4 pence to 207 pence.
   Water stocks were again sought for their defensive
qualities, as were food retailers. NorthWest Water rose a
penny to 239 pence, Thames Water gained 3 pence to 234 pence,
Sainsbury advanced a penny to 296 pence, and Tesco hardened 4
pence to 225.5 pence.
   Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Paris, Milan and
Madrid, mixed in Brussels and Amsterdam, and lower in
Frankfurt, Zurich and Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed higher.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Seoul, higher in Taipei and
Hong Kong, and mixed in Singapore, Manila, Wellington and
Sydney.
