   LONDON -- STC PLC's proposed sale of 80% of its ICL Ltd.
subsidiary, Britain's only mainframe computer maker, to
Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan for #700 million ($1.33 billion) was
approved by shareholders, the British electronics company
said.
   The approval effectively lets STC proceed to complete the
sale of the stake, which was initially announced in July.

   In STC's latest first-half results, ICL contributed the
most, despite a slump in pretax profit to #77.7 million from
#115 million a year earlier.
