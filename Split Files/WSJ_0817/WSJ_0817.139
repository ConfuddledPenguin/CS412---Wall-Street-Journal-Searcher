   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. -- Members of the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission hinted they would need more time to
evaluate Donald J. Trump's $65 million bank bailout plan, but
a lawyer for the developer pressed for a speedy decision on
the matter.
   Meanwhile Mr. Trump has rehired Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., his
longtime accounting firm, to work on the casino matter,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Mr.
Trump terminated his relationship with the firm in June
because of complaints from bankers about Andersen's
monitoring of Mr. Trump's business affairs. The Trump
Organization said yesterday that Andersen was rehired because
it has more expertise in the casino business than Kenneth
Levanthal &amp; Co., which will continue to oversee the Trump
bailout.

   The gaming commission had scheduled meetings for yesterday
and today to approve the bank bailout, but two commissioners
suggested they might need an additional week to evaluate the
thousands of pages of documents related to the new financing.
   Thomas Cerabino, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, testified that
any delay would cause the banks to pull out of the bailout
proposal.
   The commission's approval of the bailout, which is needed
because of Mr. Trump's casino holdings, is the last step in
the restructuring of Trump Organization.
   New details of the bank agreement emerged during the
hearing, which was attended by Mr. Trump. Mr. Cerabino, of
the New York law firm Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, said the
accord, which would suspend about $850 million in interest
payments in exchange for collateral in Trump properties,
offers powerful incentives for Mr. Trump to sell assets as
quickly as possible. He referred to documents showing that
money generated from asset sales before June 30, 1991, would
retire interest payments at a rate of $5 for every $1
generated. Cash generated from assets sold between June 30,
1991, and June 30, 1992, could retire interest at a rate of
$2 for every $1 generated. The ratio continues to diminish
over time.
   Mr. Cerabino also said that a personal bankruptcy filing
by Mr. Trump would automatically trigger a default of the
loan agreement, but a default on a single asset wouldn't
necessarily trigger a default on the whole bank agreement. In
this way, Mr. Cerabino said, the total bailout plan is
insulated from the failure of a single asset.
   On Wednesday, the commission released documents showing
that on a short-term liquidation basis, Mr. Trump could have
anywhere from a negative net worth of $294 million to a net
worth of $281 million. As a "going concern," the report said,
Mr. Trump's assets would be valued at between $479 million
and $759 million.
   The New Jersey division of Gaming Enforcement, which is
part of the state attorney general's office, hinted in a
report yesterday that it would recommend to the commission
that it approve the bailout. "It may very well be that the
greatest hope for preserving remaining value {in the Trump
empire}, lies in a quick and efficient reorganization and
work-out process -- a privatized bankruptcy of sort --
outside the courtroom," the report stated.
   Another Trump lawyer, Nick Ribis, said the plan would
present Mr. Trump with "a realistic opportunity to solve
these problems on an ongoing basis."
