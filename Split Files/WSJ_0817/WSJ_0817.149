   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Raven Industries Inc. plans to
increase its quarterly dividend 20%, and expects to report
that net income for the second quarter ended July 31 rose
about 8%, David Christensen, president and chief executive
officer said.
   The company attributed the earnings increase to a high
level of defense-equipment sales for the quarter.

   Mr. Christensen said Raven will soon announce a dividend
increase to nine cents a share from 7.5 cents a share,
payable Oct. 15 to stock of record Sept. 21.
   He estimated that net in the second quarter rose to about
$1.3 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $1.2
million, or 38 cents, a year ago. Sales fell roughly 2% to
$21.4 million from $21.8 million.
   In the six months, Mr. Christensen estimated that net rose
9% to $2.3 million, or 74 cents a share, from $2.1 million,
or 66 cents. Sales fell about 3% to $40.9 million from $42.3
million.
   The company's backlog of orders as of July 31 rose 18% to
$43.2 million from $36.7 million a year ago.
   Raven's electronics division will report that operating
profit more than doubled, largely because of increases in
orders for defense-related equipment. Sales of agricultural
controls for herbicide sprayers were also strong, said Mr.
Christensen.
   The plastics division, which makes glass fiber tops for
pickup trucks and tanks for storing industrial chemicals,
expects a 76% increase in operating profit from last year's
second quarter.
   The clothing division expects to report that operating
profit fell 39%, partly from the loss of a contract with the
Defense Department to make uniforms.
   Mr. Christensen said he expects to report "record" sales
and profit for the year ending Jan. 31, but he declined to
elaborate. Last year the company earned $4.2 million, or
$1.31, on sales of $91 million.
