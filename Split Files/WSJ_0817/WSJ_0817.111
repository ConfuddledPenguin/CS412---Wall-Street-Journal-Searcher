   BUSH'S SUCCESS in the Gulf crisis obscures grave risks for
him.
   Seepage through the embargo seems inevitable. Even if
Jordan's port of Aqaba is closed to Iraq, overland traffic is
likely to continue. Turkey may weaken in its pro-embargo
resolve if hunger mounts in Baghdad. Tehran could break the
embargo overtly, or at least wink at smugglers in Pakistan
and Afghanistan shipping through Iran to Iraq.

   Saddam Hussein courts moderate Arabs by saying he's ready
to negotiate Kuwait's fate, while he fans fundamentalist
fires. "There will be an inevitable consolidation of Arab
sentiment against the U.S.," warns ex-Pentagon hardliner
Frank Gaffney. But a Jordanian official contends any U.S.
effort to end the crisis quickly with military action would
unleash anti-American feelings.
   Bush's strong domestic support likely will erode if
American forces become bogged down by a lengthy stalemate.
                                                                                                       

   GREENSPAN SEEKS easier credit, but the Iraq crisis
complicates his job.
   The Fed chairman is worried by signs of a crumbling
economy, especially August's weak unemployment numbers and
mounting evidence of a credit crunch. But consumer price
figures add to inflation concerns. Fed Governor Wayne Angell
is disturbed by the surge in gold prices since Iraq invaded
Kuwait, and other officials fear easing now might send the
jittery bond market diving.
   Consensus may prove elusive when the Fed's policy-making
committee meets next week. Administration officials,
desperately eager to see interest rates fall, are dismayed by
the Fed's slowness to act. They regret failing to come up
with a strong replacement for Fed Vice Chairman Manuel
Johnson by now.
                                                                                                       

   BAILOUT WOES mount for savings and loan regulators.
   Short-term cleanup costs are still rising. Plans to pay
off high-interest notes that financed generous 1988
thrift-sales could add $15 billion to next year's projected
$100 billion bailout cost. The bailout agency even flounders
in its search for contractors to manage assets of failed
thrifts; winning bidders balk at terms they say would expose
them to lawsuits.
   A report next month on the 1988 deals will unleash a new
storm of criticism. Hearings by Rostenkowski and Metzenbaum,
and continuing ethics deliberations will keep the spotlight
on the S&amp;L mess. And some Republicans are trying to recruit
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to head an
expected presidential commission to investigate the disaster.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Gonzalez plans to review
the role of Reagan administration officials -- including
former Treasury Secretary Regan.
                                                                                                       

   OUTBURSTS OF ETHICS overcome candidates. Returning
donations from tainted S&amp;Ls, Sen. Harkin gives $6,500 to the
Iowa treasury and Colorado Rep. Brown writes a $9,000 check
to the Resolution Trust Corp. With free congressional
mailings an issue, Pennsylvania Rep. Clinger cancels a mass
mailing costing $35,000.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. HOSTAGES in Lebanon become indirect captives of Iraqi
policy, U.S. officials fear. The U.S. stepped up contacts
with Iran last week to get the six released. But Baghdad's
overtures to Moslem fundamentalists and to Iran could harden
the kidnappers' attitude. A Beirut magazine predicted the
Americans will be freed, but Hezbollah said that "would be a
reward to the Americans for their invasion of the Gulf."
                                                                                                       

   NOT SO FAST: Sen. Humphrey, who said he'll run for the New
Hampshire state senate rather than re-election, riles fellow
Republicans by declaring he also aims to be senate president
as a stepping stone to governor. Though Humphrey is still a
favorite to win the September primary, GOP State Sen. Bill
Johnson warns that he "could very well lose the Republican
nomination."
                                                                                                       

   MICHIGAN MUD: The state's senate race turns nasty. GOP
challenger Schuette tries to link Sen. Levin to "cozy deals,"
the congressional pay raise and the S&amp;L scandal. The Levin
campaign accuses Schuette of "distortions and innuendo."
After winning nomination, Schuette challenges Levin to
debate; days earlier, the Republican refused to debate his
primary opponent.
                                                                                                       

   CREDIT CRACKDOWN? Bush administration eyes restrictions on
student loans.
   With defaults running $2 billion a year, officials are
discussing stiffer accreditation standards for schools --
especially privately run trade schools. Requiring closer
credit checks, linking loans to students' performance and
requiring lenders to share the cost if borrowers default also
are under review.
   Democrats will fight limits on student loans, particularly
in the face of sustained Republican cuts in education grants
for lower-income students. Michigan Rep. Ford, who will
become chairman of the House Education Committee next year,
wants to make the grant program an entitlement that can't be
cut.
   The brouhaha is likely to intensify interest in
controlling other federal loan-guarantees programs. The White
House has been pressing for "credit reform" in budget talks.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: One Washington wag calls Iraq's seizure of
Kuwaiti gold after the invasion "the standard leveraged
buy-out approach." . . . How's that? Iowa Sen. Harkin,
criticized by his GOP opponent for telling Catholics he's
"pro-life" and feminists he's "pro-choice," replies that he
actually is both. . . . Since the trial of Washington's mayor
began, a local store has been selling a product called
"Marionberry Jam."
