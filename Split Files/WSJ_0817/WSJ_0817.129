   Cie. Generale des Etablissements Michelin of France
reported that its first-half consolidated revenue fell 4% to
27.37 billion francs ($5.21 billion) from 28.47 billion
francs a year earlier.
   The tire and rubber concern, which announced the results
in a mandatory legal filing, declined to provide additional
details or comparable first-half profit data. For all of
1989, Michelin had consolidated profit of 2.45 billion
francs, after payments to minority interests, on revenue of
55.26 billion francs.

   The first-half sales decline came as little surprise to
the markets, as analysts had anticipated weaker 1990 results
in the wake of price-cutting by major manufacturers in the
sector, in an effort to protect market share.
   Michelin executives in June told shareholders that the
company is likely to face three or four difficult years soon,
because of tight market conditions and plans for heavy
investment outlays. The executives also declined to rule out
the possibility of losses in the years ahead, and unveiled
previously reported job cuts aimed at holding down costs.
