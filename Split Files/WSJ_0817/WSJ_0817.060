   SHELTON, Conn. -- Forschner Group Inc. said if the dollar
continues to remain weak against the Swiss franc, 1990
earnings may be substantially lower than a year earlier.
   Forschner is the U.S. marketer of Swiss Army Knives and
other Swiss products; in 1989 it had net income of $3.1
million or 75 cents a share on sales of $43.8 million.
