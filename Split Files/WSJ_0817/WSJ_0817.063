   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- When Henry Gottfried bought a carved
mahogany cat, he never figured it would come between him and
his employer, Eastman Kodak Co.
   But it did, and in many ways, Mr. Gottfried's experience
with Kodak and his four-foot wooden feline typifies the
problems that can occur when big companies try to instill
entrepreneurial zeal within their monolithic structures.

   Mr. Gottfried's venture was part of a program begun by
Kodak in 1984 in which employees operate semiautonomous small
businesses. The company hoped the ventures could
commercialize technologies that didn't have a home in Kodak's
core business groups, which now consist of photography,
information systems and pharmaceuticals.
   While Kodak's efforts were praised last year in the
management book "When Giants Learn to Dance," the program was
always an awkward minuet, and today the party's clearly over.
Of the 14 ventures Kodak created, six have been shut down,
three have been sold, four have been merged into the company
and only one still operates independently.
   One casualty was Mr. Gottfried, who managed a business
that developed computer software and video-training products.
Dismissed by Kodak in 1987 for not meeting earnings
projections, Mr. Gottfried says the company didn't like his
business unit's logo -- a Cheshire cat, modeled after his
wooden friend.
   "Some Kodak managers said they couldn't understand why a
serious organization would use a cat," he says. After his
dismissal from the unit, called Discus Electronic Training,
Kodak gave it a new logo, a giant letter D. The business has
since been folded.
   Kodak isn't the only company that has had disappointing
results with internal ventures. Back in the 1970s,
"intrapreneurship" became a buzzword among managers who
wanted to introduce small-business fervor into lumbering
corporations. The idea was that the parent company would
provide seed money to employees, who would gain the
satisfaction of running their own shop while producing
products that benefited their corporate sponsor.
   The ventures did produce some successes. International
Business Machines Corp. developed its IBM personal computer
through such a venture. At Xerox Corp., about a half dozen
successful companies have been created, and Aluminum Co. of
America has high hopes for a venture that's marketing a
high-tech laminate.
   Most, though, have fallen flat. Companies like Control
Data Corp. and Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., now part of U
S West Inc., have ended their programs. So did IBM, which
says the program was unneccessary after the company
decentralized. The upshot: "intrapreneurship" has lost its
cachet.
   The problem, management experts say, is that a go-go
small-business culture can't easily be grafted onto a
deliberate corporate giant. The practices that make
corporations successful -- training procedures, personnel
policies, hierarchical management structures -- are anathema
to risk-taking, free-wheeling entrepreneurs.
   In addition, employees-turned-entrepreneurs are often
ill-prepared for their new roles. Researchers, for example,
who have spent their careers in the lab are unfamiliar with
the rigors of the marketplace.
   At Kodak, most of the venture managers were Kodak
employees with no experience running the kind of business the
company envisioned. "If you're running a small business, you
have to be willing to give up your house, your home, your
wife, your kids -- you have to be dedicated," says Stephen
Sayles, a former Kodak venture manager. "People who take jobs
with big companies usually aren't those type of people."
   A look at Kodak's ventures offers a glimpse into the
difficulties of whipping up an entrepreneurial environment in
a company not known for individualism or risk-taking. The
ventures were also part of a painful era for Kodak -- the
last half of the 1980s, characterized by restructurings and
layoffs, when nothing seemed to go right. Though Kodak posted
surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings, it's not yet
clear if past problems are behind it.
   Kodak's intrapreneur program was never profitable,
although Kodak won't say how much it invested. Last year,
amid a steep profit decline, Kodak said it would no longer
seek new ventures and instead would focus on its core
businesses.
   Not surprisingly, company officials and former venture
managers, some of whom are still embittered by the
experience, tell different stories about why the program
failed. But they seem to agree on at least one point:
Managers should have an equity stake in the start-up to make
them feel like it's their business, not the corporate
parent's. Kodak managers had no ownership interest in the
ventures although some received large payments when Kodak in
effect acquired the units and merged them with a main
business line.
   For their part, Kodak officials say they didn't monitor
the ventures closely enough, didn't make them stick to
business plans and were too forgiving, at least initially.
   "We didn't shoot the wounded," says Robert J. Tuite, who
was one of the architects of Kodak's venture program and has
taken a leave of absence from the company. Kodak officials
also say the new managers were naive about running a
business. "Technologists believe that a good idea will make a
good business, but it's tougher than that," says Dennis M.
Deleo, who's now in charge of the venture program.
   Former venture managers, however, accuse Kodak of setting
unrealistic sales goals -- $50 million in five years -- and
not giving them the autonomy they say they needed.
   Take Scott C. Arrington, an outside consultant who was
hired in 1985 to run a venture called Estek, which made
machines that cleaned silicon wafers. While he had authority
in hiring, he says, he had to use Kodak engineers,
researchers and other employees in joint-development efforts.
   "The Kodak people would take their eight-hour workday and
go home," he says. "When you have a start-up company, you
typically work longer hours and harder than a 20-year
employee."
   Mr. Arrington also ran afoul of Kodak management when he
bought a Xerox copier instead of a Kodak copier. "Xerox was
cheaper and better, and I was responsible for how much money
we were spending," he says, adding that Kodak never
understood the larger point of being an entrepreneur.
   "It's just not a matter of making money," he says. "It's a
matter of achieving something and feeling good about it.
That's why an entrepreneur works long hours. But Kodak took
that control away and killed the entrepreneurial spirit."
   By 1987, Estek had $10 million in annual sales but was
behind projections. Kodak toughened its sales goals, and Mr.
Arrington was fired. "I was shocked, and I felt sorry for the
people who were still there," he says. Kodak won't comment on
the dismissal of Mr. Arrington or any other employee.
   The company, dissatisfied with Estek's performance,
eventually broke up the unit, selling one division and
merging the other into Kodak. Mr. Arrington now works for an
international trade company.
   Once a venture chalked up strong profits, Kodak intended
to bring it into a mainline business group. But here again
things didn't work out as planned. A business called Sayette
Technologies, which made overhead projector parts, began in
1986 and racked up sales of $25 million in its first year.
Kodak's Motion Picture &amp; Audio Visual Division, in effect,
acquired the profitable unit from the venture manager, Mr.
Sayles, who took a job in another Kodak division.
   Kodak, however, later decided that Sayette didn't fit the
company's strategic interests, and the unit was sold off this
year. Kodak won't say if it sold Sayette for more or less
than it bought it. Mr. Sayles, who eventually left Kodak,
says Sayette's profit fell under Kodak's management because
costs skyrocketed. Once it was no longer a venture, Kodak had
to pay health and retirement benefits and use the company's
distribution network, which Mr. Sayles says was more
expensive.
   In addition, Mr. Sayles says, Kodak, which has $18.3
billion in annual sales, didn't give Sayette the attention a
fledging enterprise needs. "A small company must make
decisions faster than a large company," he says. "We only had
one or two lines of businesses to concern ourselves with,
whereas Kodak has thousands."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Gottfried, a consultant before becoming the
Discus venture manager, admits he made mistakes while running
the unit, but blames Kodak's outsized expectations for
dooming the business. To reach the $50 million annual sales
goal, Mr. Gottfried says, he had to take steps that
ultimately caused expenses to spin out of control. "Kodak
wouldn't accept a profitable $2 million business," he says.
Kodak shut down Discus last year, saying the unit didn't fit
the company's strategic interests and didn't make enough
money.
   Nothing, however, gave Mr. Gottfried a bigger headache
than trying to reclaim his wooden cat, which he bought from a
Belize woodcarver for several thousand dollars. He says that
he left it in his Kodak office but that his successors didn't
want to give it back.
   Finally, he says, he called Kodak's legal department, and
on a Sunday morning eight months after he had left the
company, he got the cat back.
