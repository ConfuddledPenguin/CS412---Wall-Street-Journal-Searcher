   DALLAS -- Sam Wyly, unsuccessful in his plan last year to
sell Michaels Stores Inc., a company controlled by his
family, was named chief executive officer in a reorganization
that he said "represents a long-term Wyly commitment to
Michaels."
   As part of the reorganization, Mr. Wyly said he named
Donald G. Thomson president and also rehired Michael J. Dupey
-- founder of Michaels -- with whom Wyly had a falling out
several years ago. "We were married and we got divorced and
we are getting married again," said Mr. Wyly, who has been
chairman of the company since 1984. Mr. Dupey will serve as
an adviser.

   The moves come after two years of disappointment for the
chain of arts-and-crafts retail stores. In fiscal 1989 the
company had profit of only $5.2 million, or 50 cents a share,
on sales of almost $250 million, and in fiscal 1990, ended
Jan. 28, earnings fell to $13,000 on sales of almost $290
million. Last year's earnings were hurt because of expenses
incurred in the failed acquisition by MSI Holdings Inc., an
investment group thwarted by the troubled junk-bond market
and by Michaels' own poor performance.
   Mr. Wyly, who with his family holds a 39% stake in
Michaels, said the company is no longer for sale. "We are now
committed to owning a company," he said, adding that the
primary objective is "to improve the yield we get on our
assets." He predicted that fiscal 1991 results would be
"significantly better" than those in the previous year.
   Mr. Wyly said that as chief executive he would devote more
time to Michaels. But Mr. Wyly, who is also chairman of
Dallas-based Sterling Software Inc., said Michaels would be
run primarily by Mr. Thomson, a Michaels director and
longtime business consultant to the Wyly family.
   As chief executive and president, Mr. Wyly and Mr. Thomson
are succeeding B.B. Tuley, who has held those posts since
1986. Mr. Wyly, who recruited Mr. Tuley to Michaels in 1984,
said the two of them reached "a mutual decision" for Mr.
Tuley to resign. "It was time for a change," said Mr. Wyly.
Mr. Tuley couldn't be reached for comment.
   Observers say a management change couldn't hurt. "Two
Christmases ago they had too much inventory and had to reduce
it at distressed prices, then the reverse happened last
Christmas -- inventories were too low," says Dennis Telzrow,
a retail analyst for Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner.
   Those are the types of wrinkles that Mr. Dupey, the
Michaels founder, might iron out. As the man "largely
responsible for creating today's arts, crafts and hobby
industry," Mr. Dupey will advise the company on the selection
and marketing of seasonal and promotional merchandise, Mr.
Wyly said.
