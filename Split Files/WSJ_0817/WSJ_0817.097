   DALLAS -- The former owner of a Texas thrift that failed
under the weight of fraudulent condominium-development loans
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the federal deposit
insurance fund.
   Welba Lee "Bubba" Keetch Jr., who owned the defunct First
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Burkburnett, Texas, also
pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud, misapplication of
thrift funds and illegally participating in the proceeds of a
loan.

<TEXT>
   The Burkburnett thrift was one of six Texas savings
associations that poured at least $750 million into land
acquisitions and condominium developments along Interstate
30, east of Dallas, in 1982 and 1983. Some 2,000 condominiums
were built, glutting the Dallas real estate market.
   The loans, which were inflated by fraudulent land
appraisals, also provided millions of dollars in profits for
the financiers and developers of the condominiums, according
to court records and the testimony of appraisers and
promoters who participated in the scheme.
   Mr. Keetch is one of 102 people who have been convicted of
federal crimes in connection with the condominium lending
scheme. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 13 years in
federal prison and a $275,000 fine. Mr. Keetch is scheduled
for sentencing Oct. 25 before Judge Barefoot Sanders of
Dallas.
