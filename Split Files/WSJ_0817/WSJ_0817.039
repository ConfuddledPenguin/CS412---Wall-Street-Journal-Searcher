   EAST AURORA, N.Y. -- Acme Electric Corp. will post
lower-than-expected earnings of about 78 cents a share for
the year ended June 30, G. Wayne Hawk, president and chief
executive officer, said.
   However, Mr. Hawk said in an interview that the power
conversion equipment concern will start to show better
results in fiscal 1991, as newly developed programs become
profitable. Capital that was poured into these programs
limited earnings this past year, he said.

   In fiscal 1989, Acme reported net income of $3.9 million,
or 85 cents a share, including a one-time credit of $443,000,
or 10 cents a share, for an accounting adjustment.
   "It was a flat year compared to last year," Mr. Hawk said.
Sales were off "a few hundred dollars" from $91 million in
fiscal 1989. He expects earnings in the first quarter, which
ends Sept. 30, to be close to last year's 16 cents a share.
He also projected sales in excess of $100 million for fiscal
1991.
   Mr. Hawk attributed the disappointing 1990 results to a
slowdown in the construction industry, which hurt Acme's
sales of large air-cooled transformers. The company also lost
practically all its September sales of battery chargers when
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., a major customer, rearranged its
departments. The easing of Cold War tensions also forced Acme
to scale back its expectations for its power supplies for
aerospace and defense.
   The disappointments were partially offset by unexpectedly
high growth in custom power supplies for computer systems.
   Mr. Hawk said net income would have increased an
additional 25 cents a share without the costs the company
incurred in developing new programs. These include a
redesigned back-up power supply for personal computers and
local networks. Mr. Hawk said he expects an 80% increase in
sales in this area in 1991.
   Acme also produced its first fiber nickel-cadmium battery
in February, which it expects to generate annual sales of $20
million within three years.
   The new efforts "haven't had a real bottom line impact,"
said John B. Walthausen, an analyst with C.L. King &amp;
Associates, Albany, N.Y. But, he added, "It's starting to
come through now."
   Since Acme has incurred high costs to expand, it could be
particularly vulnerable in a recession. The sluggish
Northeastern computer industry has already hurt business, Mr.
Hawk said. Acme hopes to counteract a slowdown with its new
products and increasing foreign sales.
   When Mr. Hawk, 62 years old, assumed his position at Acme
in 1987, yearly earnings had bottomed out at 15 cents a
share. He has since shifted the sleepy transformer concern
into a more diversified electronics business employing 1,055
people. "It's been a painful and expensive process," he said.
