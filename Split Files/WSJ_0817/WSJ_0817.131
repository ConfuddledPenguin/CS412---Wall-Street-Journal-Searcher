   Quest Medical Inc. said it isn't interested in a merger
proposal from Titan Holdings Inc., a private insurance
holding company based in San Antonio, Texas.
   Under the proposal, Titan would merge into Quest in a
stock deal that would leave control of the Dallas-based
medical products maker in Titan shareholders' hands. "We fail
to see what substantive benefit this has to Quest or its
shareholders," said Thomas Thompson, president of Quest.

   Under the proposal, Quest would give Titan shareholders
about 9.9 million newly issued shares, which would give Titan
holders about 63.5% of Quest's common stock. In return, Quest
would absorb all 120,750 Titan common shares, which Titan
says have an unaudited book value of $236 a share, or about
$28.5 million.
   Titan wants to go public and its managers believe they can
use Quest's "unutilized capital resources" better than
Quest's management has, said Michael Bodayle, chief financial
officer of Titan. Mr. Bodayle said Titan executives have met
with Mr. Thompson and believe that Quest hasn't seriously
considered Titan's offer.
   Mr. Thompson said Quest still holds about $10 million
following the sale of a division and is looking for an
acquisition in the health-care manufacturing industry.
