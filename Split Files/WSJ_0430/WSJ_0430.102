   Most people learn best by doing something useful with what
they are learning. Without application, school learning fades
rapidly. By the time they reach high school, young people who
do not expect to go on to college are often persuaded that
school subjects are irrelevant. Their work experiences
encourage this belief: More than half of all U.S. high school
students are employed outside of school hours, but teen-agers
jobs' seldom require academic skills, leaving them with a
distorted view of school's connection to work.
   German apprenticeship is an educational institution that
links school and work and that engages young people in
significant tasks under the supervision of knowledgeable
adults. Apprentices learn at work some of the things they
missed in the classroom. Simultaneously, they discover that
apparently irrelevant subjects are important in jobs that are
more demanding than serving hamburgers or stocking shelves.

   Despite the consensus among English-language historians
that industrialization doomed apprenticeship, it thrives in
all the German-speaking countries, enrolling more than 60% of
high-school-age youth in West Germany. Traditional
apprenticeship persists in the U.S., especially in the
construction trades, but it is a small institution, and the
median age of the quarter million or so American apprentices
is greater than 25. Apprentice-like opportunities such as
community service, school-based enterprises, and cooperative
education are more accessible to teen-agers, but
college-bound students are often given preference over the
students who most need out-of-classroom learning.
   In the U.S., apprenticeship programs are frequently
casualties of pressure to increase test scores, raise
academic standards, and cut costs. A program in New Jersey
was terminated the year after being hailed as an example to
the nation in Ernest Boyer's book, "High School" and in a
film based on the book.
   West Germany's apprenticeship system would not work in the
U.S. But it demonstrates that work-based learning can be
incorporated into an educational system on a large scale.
German apprentices typically spend one day a week in school
during a three-year apprenticeship that begins between the
ages of 15 and 18. A national examination certifies that each
apprentice who has passed has acquired adequate German,
social studies, math and science, as well as specifically
job-related knowledge and skills. By age 18 or 20 apprentices
have qualified themselves for career-entry jobs and for
further schooling. Even training in an unrelated area is
advantageous because it demonstrates to a prospective
employer the applicant's diligence, responsibility and
ability to learn. The American problem of illiterate high
school graduates is unknown in Germany.
   Apprenticeship puts employers in the education business.
German firms pay apprentices' training costs and a wage
appropriate to their productivity, usually one-third to
one-half of a skilled worker's wages. School officials,
government representatives, labor-union delegates and others
are involved in designing and overseeing the system, but
employers have the majority voice because they make the
largest investment.
   Why would American employers invest in the education and
training of youth? Only because they concluded that schools
alone were unable to provide them with young workers equipped
to meet the future's challenges. In West Germany, corporate
leaders are so convinced of apprenticeship's value that they
steadfastly resist labor unions' proposals to substitute
tax-supported schooling for apprenticeship, gladly picking up
the tab in order to maintain control over training quality.
   An American apprenticeship system must be as flexible and
diverse as our labor market and educational system. It should
open doors, not channel people into narrowly defined
occupational slots. To prepare youth for the future, it must
first promote the acquisition of basic academic knowledge and
skills, because they are the foundation for learning and
upgrading specific job skills.
   U.S. apprenticeship would not be neat and tidy. It would
grow from local and regional efforts, rather than from
central planning. Experiments are in the planning stages at
Aetna Corp. in Hartford, with a consortium of steel producers
in northern Indiana, and on a regional basis in Boston and
Pittsburgh. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole has created a
new Office of Work-Based Learning to support demonstration
efforts such as these. All of them will turn workplaces into
places for learning and connect school learning with learning
on the job.
   Corporate leaders have become advocates for school reform
because they recognize that deficient education threatens the
nation's prosperity and social order. But schools are not the
only, or even the best, place for learning. A far more active
-- and more costly -- partnership is now required, in which
learning on the job becomes as least as important for youth
as learning in school.
