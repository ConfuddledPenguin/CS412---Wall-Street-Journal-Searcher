   DALLAS -- The question sounds simple enough. "Ignacio,"
the counselor asks, "who discovered America?"
   A hush falls over the class as Ignacio Prado's dark,
weather-beaten face turns pale and sweat rolls down his
forehead. His wife and two daughters watch in solemn
embarrassment.

   Mr. Prado's interrogator, Angel Loredo, paces the floor,
playing with a long rubber band. "Ignacio, he's not Mexican
and he's not George Washington or George Bush," he says
impatiently. Mr. Prado's eyes light up. "Dan Quayle," he
blurts out. "God no," wails Mr. Loredo, who hurls the rubber
band in frustration and orders everyone to repeat: "I want to
learn. I will learn. I'm going to learn."
   But Mr. Prado's problem isn't ignorance of history. When
the counselor repeats the same question in Spanish, Mr. Prado
gets it right.
   So goes another teeth-grinding day in amnesty class, part
of a $4 billion government effort to quickly assimilate the
largest single group of newly legalized immigrants in U.S.
history.
   Mr. Prado, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, hid from
immigration officials for more than 20 years. He is one of
about 1.7 million undocumented aliens who were granted
temporary resident status under the amnesty provisions of the
historic immigration reform law of 1986. But, it turns out,
they weren't home free.
   To gain permanent resident status by November -- the
deadline set by the law for most of them -- the immigrants
must show proficiency in the English language and knowledge
of U.S. history and civics. A majority of amnesty-seekers try
to meet these requirements by taking 40-hour cram courses
sponsored by the government.
   Previous immigrants didn't have to worry about language
and history unless they were seeking U.S. citizenship. But to
get the reform bill passed with the controversial amnesty
concept intact, congressional supporters agreed to the
stiffer requirements. "There was a sense of making the
applicants earn their legal status," says Michael Zamba, a
director of the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials, known as NALEO.
   Now, however, a growing number of critics say the cram
courses are a waste of money for taxpayers and a humiliating
ritual for immigrants. "Why kid ourselves?" asks Robert M.
Paral, an NALEO immigration policy analyst. "How can anyone
expect a person to learn English in 40 hours? It's simply
unrealistic."
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service apparently
thinks so too. It declines to deport any immigrants as long
as they get a certificate from their teacher asserting they
put forth a "good-faith effort" to learn the required
subjects.
   "I was told by a supervisor if a student is there for 40
hours, give him a certificate -- no questions asked," says
Susan McBride, a teacher in an amnesty class. At last count,
95% of the applicants taking the course nationwide have
passed, although, like Mr. Prado, few have mastered the
intricacies of English or the three branches of the
government.
   The near certainty of passing doesn't make the program any
less painful for the immigrants. Consider the experiences of
Mr. Prado's class of 42 immigrants -- construction workers,
cooks, bus boys and maids -- which met three times a week for
a month and a half in a brightly lit room at St. Augustine
Catholic Church.
   It is Saturday, the end of the first week, and some
students, unable to afford babysitters, have brought their
children to class. When Ms. McBride, the teacher, steps out
for a few minutes, the students give vent to their
frustrations. "I don't understand this in English or Spanish,
I don't, I don't," moans Hermelinda Garibaldi, banging her
head on a desktop.
   Other students agonize loudly over a list of singular and
plural nouns. Jesus Reyes, whose name is taped to his
workshirt, tries to restore order. "Don't lose hope," he
bellows. "We've made it this far."
   Ms. McBride reappears, a bit overwhelmed by the chaos.
"Relax. Stand up. Take a deep breath and say, `We're having a
good day,'" she croons in the time-honored patter of the
third-grade school teacher she is. The exercise pacifies the
students momentarily, but as soon as classwork resumes, so
does the fidgeting. "Maybe I'm throwing out too much, too
soon," Ms. McBride concedes.
   As the hour draws to a close, Ms. McBride flips through
her Spanish-English dictionary and reads out the word "tarea"
-- homework. She then hands out mimeographed sheets with
fill-in-the-blank grammar questions -- her only option, since
textbooks haven't arrived. The students groan. "Aw, c'mon,
break your head a little," the teacher implores, tapping her
own head with a fist. "It won't hurt."
   But it feels painful for most of these harried students.
Many don't relish demonstrating their lack of education.
Others are just bone-weary from long hours at their jobs.
Aura Sanchez, 25, a housekeeper with two children and a third
on the way, works a full day while her mother-in-law cares
for her two preschool-age children; the classroom burdens
only add to her parental guilt. "Sometimes I feel as though
I'm being a bad mother, neglecting my children," she says.
   During the second week, 28 slower learners are transferred
to John Lopez's classroom. Normally a seventh-grade teacher,
Mr. Lopez asks the students to name the 13 original colonies.
   "Teacher, no more questions," Ms. Garibaldi pleads. "My
head feel no good." And then, slipping into Spanish, "I have
to get up at 5 a.m. to work." Ms. Garibaldi cleans downtown
office buildings from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every morning,
supplementing her meager pay with part-time housekeeping and
waitressing jobs.
   It is that kind of existence these students hope to
escape. For most of them, life prior to amnesty was one of
uncertainty and fear. Mr. Prado spent several years building
a small food-distribution business; as an illegal immigrant,
he could have lost it in a heartbeat.
   At the next session, Mr. Lopez and Ms. McBride introduce a
tutor named Angelina, a high-school student who emigrated
here from Jalisco, Mexico. She works with students who are
practically illiterate, even in Spanish, and thus in need of
more one-to-one attention. But by the end of the week, the
funds to cover Angelina's salary still haven't been approved
by a web of federal, state and local agencies. With no
guarantee that her wages will ever be approved, she quits.
   The third week brings more bad news. Because funds are
held up, the textbooks still haven't arrived. And now Mr.
Lopez announces they probably won't be available until a few
days before graduation. He has been covertly making copies of
his teacher's manual for the students. The manual contains
the same material as the textbooks, but includes the answers
to study questions in the back. "I've already been caught
once," he confesses, adding that he was let off with a
warning by school officials. "But my students are more
important. This is their only chance to learn."
   Mr. Lopez's group seems buried in despair, struggling with
the simplest of concepts, such as the colors of the flag. By
contrast, Ms. McBride's much-smaller advanced group, people
who came into the class with a firmer grasp of English,
easily discuss predicate nouns and the three branches of
government. "We're rolling now," she says. "Next thing you
know, they'll be asking for a pay raise."
   Over the next few sessions, the cocky advanced group even
engages in bilingual debates on U.S. democracy, civil rights
and press freedoms. Maria Gomez, a native of Mexico City,
offers to recite the preamble to the Constitution. "We the
people . . . " she begins, painstakingly completing the
passage amid cheers and a standing ovation from her jubilant
classmates. Ms. McBride is teary-eyed.
   The books finally arrive during week five, but only three
classes remain. Some students consider petitioning for more
classroom hours. Liliana Anaya, 24, a secretary at a clothing
factory, plans to continue language courses on her own. "My
boss tells me that if I learn more English, I can work in
computers," she says.
   On the last day of class, the final exam is overshadowed
by plans for a party. But Vicenta Faz, 48, is weeping softly,
fearful of failing the exam, fearful that her infrequent
participation in class discussions will prompt the teacher to
withhold her certificate. The night before, she barely slept.
"I'm scared because I don't think I've learned much," she
says.
   But the final exam is easier than anticipated; only two of
the 42 students fail and both are deemed worthy of
certificates.
   At graduation, with their hair slicked back, the men in
suits and the women teetering on high-heeled shoes, the St.
Augustine class listens intently as the keynote speaker,
immigration attorney Juan Jasso, urges them to become
politically active in their new homeland.
   Mr. Jasso, whose parents also are immigrants, addresses
them in Spanish, of course. "Otherwise, they won't understand
me," he explains.
