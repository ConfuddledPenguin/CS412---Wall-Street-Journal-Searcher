   NEW YORK -- A federal grand jury indicted two former top
marketing executives of Paramount Pictures Corp. on
tax-evasion charges involving alleged kickbacks from
companies doing business with Paramount.
   The former executives, Gordon Weaver and Stephen Rose,
resigned from their jobs at Paramount's motion-picture
division in 1984 at the company's request. Paramount, a unit
of Paramount Communications Inc., asked the two men to resign
following an investigation of unethical practices allegedly
involving the company's suppliers. The indictment apparently
involves the same allegations made against the two men in
1984.

   Mr. Weaver, formerly president of marketing for the
motion-picture division, was indicted on charges of
conspiring to evade federal taxes and filing false tax
returns for 1983 and 1984. Mr. Rose, formerly senior vice
president for marketing in the motion-picture division, was
indicted on one count of filing a false 1984 tax return.
   The indictment accuses the men of receiving kickbacks of
money, goods and services from various companies doing
business with Paramount. The kickbacks allegedly included
free use of a summer home on Fire Island in New York for Mr.
Weaver and the purchase of a MercedesBenz for Mr. Rose.
   The indictment says that the two men failed to report the
kickbacks as income on their tax returns. Avraham Moskowitze,
the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, declined to
disclose the total value of the alleged kickbacks.
   The indictment also alleges that between 1978 and 1984 Mr.
Weaver extorted kickbacks from companies doing business with
Paramount by threatening that Paramount would withhold its
business if the kickbacks weren't made.
   In a statement, Mr. Weaver, who now runs his own marketing
company, Gordon Weaver Enterprises, said the allegations were
"unsupported" and "utterly lacking in credibility." His
attorney, Robert Fink, said, "These allegations are six years
old. . . . As the statute of limitations on these charges was
about to run out, there was a rush to indict."
   Gerald Walpin, an attorney for Mr. Rose, said, "When all
the facts come out, this won't be considered anywhere near a
major charge against Mr. Rose." He declined to comment when
asked whether Mr. Rose denied the allegations.
   A spokeswoman for Paramount declined to comment.
   According to the indictment, Mr. Weaver and Mr. Rose
received the kickbacks from Spiros Associates and Filmland
Production, two New York companies that did business with
Paramount. The indictment says that Mr. Rose asked Filmland
to provide him with the Mercedes-Benz in April 1983. He also
is accused of receiving about $2,260 from Filmland in
November 1983 to pay for a party for his daughter.
   The two men are to be arraigned in federal court in
Manhattan Thursday. If convicted, Mr. Weaver would face a
maximum fine of $700,000 and a prison sentence of up to 17
years. Mr. Rose would face a maximum fine of $100,000 and a
sentence of up to three years.
