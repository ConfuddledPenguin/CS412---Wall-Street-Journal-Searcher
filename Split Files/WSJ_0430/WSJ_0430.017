   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it agreed to acquire an
additional 15.8% of Breakwater Resources Ltd., Vancouver,
British Columbia, in exchange for about 3.3 million Corona
Class A shares with an indicated market value of US$22.1
million.
   The gold mining company said acquisition of the 10 million
Breakwater shares would boost its stake to about 17.4 million
shares, or 27.6%, of Breakwater, a mining company. Corona
already holds about 7.4 million Breakwater shares, including
500,000 that it said it bought in a private transaction last
Thursday.

   In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Corona Class A shares closed at $6.625, down 12.5 cents. In
national over-the-counter trading, Breakwater shares closed
at $1.8125, unchanged.
   Corona said the 10 million Breakwater shares will be
acquired in two transactions, of nine million and one million
shares, respectively, which are subject to regulatory
approval. It didn't identify the current holders of the
shares.
   A Breakwater spokeswoman said the company doesn't know the
identity of the holders, indicating that the holding of nine
million shares had been accumulated recently. The company
declined to comment further.
   Corona, which has long had a major stake in Breakwater,
said it intends to increase its holding further, for
investment purposes.
