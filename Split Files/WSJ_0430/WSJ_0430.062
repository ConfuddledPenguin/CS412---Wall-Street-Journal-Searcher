   EQUIMARK Corp. (Pittsburgh) -- Nicholas J. Zennario
resigned as president of the Equibank unit of this bank
holding company. Mr. Zennario, who said he will pursue other
business interests, will be succeeded by James H. McLaughlin,
who was Mr. Zennario's predecessor as president. Mr.
McLaughlin left that position in July to work on Equimark's
proposed acquisition of National Bancshares Corp. of Texas.
That deal fell through Friday.
