   WASHINGTON -- With little fanfare, the Supreme Court has
toppled one of the pillars of the 1960s court led by Chief
Justice Earl Warren.
   Constitutional law experts say the justices, who scarely
acknowledged the sweep of their recent ruling, significantly
altered their approach to cases involving the "free exercise"
of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment. The court gave
state and local governments substantially more authority to
enforce their laws, even when those laws conflict with
religious practices.

   "It's the single most dramatic change in free exercise
doctrine in the last 25 years," says William Van Alstyne, a
Duke University Law School professor. "It's the clearest
doctrinal turnaround in the constitutional area," says
Michael McConnell, a University of Chicago Law School
professor.
   Free exercise cases, as they are called, have always been
difficult for the Supreme Court; they often require the court
to recognize special treatment for people because of their
religious beliefs. In 1972, for example, the court ruled that
Wisconsin had to exempt the Amish from compulsory public
school attendance after the eighth grade; although the vote
was 7-0, there were four separate opinions.
   The case decided recently involved a challenge by American
Indians to an Oregon law that makes it a crime to use the
hallucinogenic drug peyote. The Native American Church uses
the drug for sacramental ceremonies. The Oregon Supreme Court
ruled that applying the ban to prohibit the religious use of
peyote violated the free exercise of the Indians' religion.
   But the U.S. Supreme Court, in an opinion written by
Justice Antonin Scalia, reversed the state court ruling by a
6-3 vote and said that a total ban on peyote use doesn't
violate the First Amendment. Given the legal complexity of
the case, it isn't the result that is so surprising, but the
way that Justice Scalia justified the decision.
   Beginning in 1963, in a major Warren Court decision, the
justices have said that state governments must have a
"compelling" reason for enforcing a law that interferes with
someone's religion. Since then, the court has ruled in some
cases that a state's rationale was sufficient; in other
cases, a majority has said that a state law infringed on
religious freedom.
   But Justice Scalia simply discarded the "compelling
interest" test. Although saying he wasn't overruling the
test, he said that it has been applied only to state laws
denying unemployment benefits to people who refused to work
on their sabbath or under other conditions that violated
their religious beliefs. In all other contexts, he concluded,
a state is free to require everyone to comply with a law that
is generally valid. A state may make exceptions for religious
practices, but isn't required to do so by the Constitution,
he said.
   "This is something of a revolution in doctrine," says
Prof. Van Alstyne of Duke.
   He and Chicago's Prof. McConnell agree that,
theoretically, the ruling means that states aren't required
to make exceptions to their laws to allow Catholic priests to
give communion to minors, who would otherwise be legally
barred from drinking wine or other alcoholic beverages.
   No one is suggesting that local sheriffs or state troopers
start rounding up priests for violating state drinking-age
laws. But under Justice Scalia's ruling, they could.
   There are more practical examples. Many courts have
required prison officials to accommodate requests by Jewish
inmates to be provided kosher meals. Those requests could be
denied now.
   Prof. McConnell, who has studied the history of the
adoption of the free exercise guarantee, notes that the
recent court decision failed to examine history at all. Even
200 years ago, he says, "free exercise of religion entailed
exemptions from generally applicable state laws." He said 12
of the 13 original states had free exercise guarantees in
their constitutions and made exceptions for different
religious practices.
   Even a member of the majority that upheld the Oregon law,
Justice Sandra O'Connor, noted in a separate opinion that the
court "dramatically departs from well-settled First
Amendment" principles. The dissent, written by Justice Harry
Blackmun, was even more blunt: "It effects a wholesale
overturning of settled law. . . ."
