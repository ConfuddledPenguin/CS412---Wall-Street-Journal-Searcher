   Stock prices may be falling, interest rates rising and
Japan's market in turmoil, but the small investor seems all
but oblivious. In March, stock funds enjoyed their biggest
inflows in three years, and April seems to have been another
good month.
   "Main Street is showing much greater confidence in the
future than Wall Street," says Avi Nachmany, an analyst with
Strategic Insight, a division of Jesup &amp; Lamont Securities.
"It's manifested in equities outselling bonds, and growth and
aggressive growth equities outselling conservative equities.
That's totally different from the post-crash environment."

   Mutual fund groups reported strong inflows into stock
funds for April, though the pace was less brisk than in
March. According to the Investment Company Institute's data
for March, stock funds pulled in $3.1 billion more than they
surrendered to departing shareholders. That produced the
industry's best month since April 1987, when $5.5 billion
poured into stock funds. (These figures include fund switches
as well as sales and redemptions; they exclude reinvested
dividends.)
   Despite the relatively strong investment results of
technology and small-company funds during the first quarter,
investors continued to shy away from both types of fund in
April.
   Vanguard Group reported overall net outflows from its
three small-company stock funds and its technology specialty
fund. Even T. Rowe Price Associates, which has traditionally
been strong in the small-company area and also has one of the
better-performing no-load technology funds, saw little
interest in either type of fund.
   Instead, Vanguard reported strong interest in its Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index fund. T. Rowe Price said its best sellers
in April were its international funds and its equity-income
fund.
   While investors snapped up stock funds, stock fund
managers turned even more bearish. In March, they kept 11.9%
of their portfolios in cash, up from 11.6% in February and
8.7% in March 1989.
   For junk fund managers, the bad news was the April sale by
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. of its $290 million
portfolio of junk bond mutual funds. But while Shearson was
redeeming, it seems a good number of small investors were
buying.
   "Some people have come in and started bottom fishing in
the high-yield area," reports Michael Hines, a marketing vice
president with Fidelity Investments.
   The bottom fishing began in March, when the people who
regularly switch from one mutual fund to another started
moving into high-yield junk. Although the switchers put more
into junk than they pulled out, redemptions by departing
shareholders far outpaced new sales, so that junk bond funds
suffered a net outflow of $231 million for the month. That
was the smallest loss since junk funds started hemorrhaging
assets in July 1989.
   Despite Shearson's massive redemption, the biggest loser
in April seems to have been bond funds that don't hold junk.
Rising interest rates panicked bond-fund holders,
particularly those in longer-term government bond funds.
   Massachusetts Financial Services and Fidelity Investments
both saw net outflows from bond funds in April, while
Vanguard saw its inflows cut by half compared with March.
   April's setback followed buoyant sales in March, when all
bond funds (other than junk) picked up $1.2 billion. "When
you look at bond funds {for March}, the biggest pickup is in
the Ginnie Mae area and the government bond area," notes Mr.
Nachmany. Ginnie Maes were offering the highest yield after
junk funds, so "money was rolling in."
