   WAREHAM, Mass. -- Tons of Toys Inc. said it filed a
reorganization plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Boston.
   The plan calls for Tons of Toys to be merged with T.H.E.
Corp., a closely held toy retailer in California, the company
said. The plan also calls for Tons of Toys' unsecured
creditors to get about $2.8 million, which the company said
will represent at least 20% of their claims approved by the
court. T.H.E. stockholders will own about 65% of Tons of
Toys' stock after the reorganization.

   Tons of Toys' remaining stock will be divided between
holders of the company's $5 million of subordinated debt, an
unidentified investor and current shareholders, the company
said.
   The plan is subject to various conditions, including
receipt of $4 million in equity financing by certain
investors, the company said.
   Certain Tons of Toys' creditors last December filed a
petition to place the company in involuntary bankruptcy. A
motion by creditors now is pending before the bankruptcy
court to convert the bankruptcy proceeding to a liquidation
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, Tons of Toys said.
The motion is scheduled for a hearing next Monday.
