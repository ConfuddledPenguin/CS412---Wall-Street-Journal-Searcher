serve until January, when the winner of special elections
held during the regular primary and general elections will be
seated to serve the remaining four years of Sen. Matsunaga's
term.

   Mr. Akaka, 65, has announced that he will enter the race
to fill Sen. Matsunaga's full term. Hawaii's other member of
the House, Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki, has said she is
interested in running.
   Sen. Matsunaga, a Democrat, was elected to the Senate in
1976 after serving 14 years in the U.S. House. He died of
complications of prostate cancer.
