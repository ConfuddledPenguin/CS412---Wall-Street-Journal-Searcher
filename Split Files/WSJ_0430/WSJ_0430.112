   VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. -- Ever since Lithuanian authorities
started rationing gasoline last week, black marketeers at the
openair bazaar on the edge of town have been doing a roaring
trade, even though they risk two years in jail and fines up
to $8,000 if they are caught.
   One afternoon, six of them chat and joke by their cars,
falling silent as a burly Russian with a walrus moustache
approaches. "How much?" he asks.

   "Seventy," one replies.
   That's ridiculous, says the Russian, a foreman at a local
furniture factory. "Two days ago, it cost 50." The black
marketeer shrugs and turns back to his colleagues. "That's
what happens if Lithuania gets independence," the Russian
mutters, walking away empty-handed. "Prices will go up every
half hour."
   Seven weeks after Lithuania's elected parliament declared
independence, the people of this tiny Baltic republic are
beginning to pay the price. As economic sanctions imposed by
Moscow start to bite, gasoline at $25 a gallon is a taste of
further hardship. Ten thousand people are out of jobs or
taking unpaid leaves, and tens of thousands more could become
unemployed as factories close because of shortages of fuel
and parts.
   In Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and other Soviet republics,
people would riot over less. But so far, most Lithuanians
display a calm bordering on stoicism. They are proud of their
government's defiance of Moscow, and insist they are prepared
to suffer for it. Just beneath the surface, however, lurks a
nagging feeling of uncertainty as many now quietly admit that
what started out as a fairy tale might not have a happy
ending.
   "People just don't know what will happen next," says Ona
Matulioniene, a 72-year-old pensioner who spent eight years
in a Siberian prison camp after the Soviets annexed Lithuania
in 1940. "How will our children and grandchildren live?"
   Last week, the Vilnius plastics plant where Mrs.
Matulioniene works as a part-time cleaner sent a truckload of
piping to a customer in Leningrad. When the driver arrived,
filling stations there took one look at his Lithuanian
license plates and refused to fill his tank. "The Soviets
aren't gentlemen," says Gintautas Andriunas, an official at
the plant. "It's rather ridiculous."
   The government thinks so, too. As it scrambles to find
ways to beat the blockade, it is sending out a cheerful,
upbeat message. Rather than venting anger at Mikhail
Gorbachev, officials prefer to gently ridicule his strong-arm
tactics.
   "Whoever gave orders for an economic blockade of Lithuania
should be nominated for one of the republic's major awards,"
says Romualdas Ozolas, the deputy prime minister. "A new
economic system is being formed in Lithuania."
   (Yesterday, however, there was a conciliatory signal from
Moscow. The Associated Press quoted Vilnius Radio as saying
that the Soviet Union unexpectedly eased part of its economic
blockade against Lithuania, almost doubling the amount of
natural gas flowing to the republic.)
   In the absence of a compromise with Moscow -- and of
support from the West -- the Lithuanians are pinning their
hopes on potential allies in the other Soviet republics.
Managers and government officials are busy contacting
suppliers and customers throughout the union, hoping to
establish direct trade ties that circumvent the central
planners in Moscow. Vilnius says it would even be prepared to
pay hard currency for Soviet supplies of oil.
   "I'm sure the blockade will resolve itself in a happy way
for Lithuania and the Soviet Union, too," Mr. Ozolas says.
"Of course," he adds, "I'm a philosopher, not an economist."
   The government, in fact, has more than its fair share of
academics, starting with President Vytautas Landsbergis, a
rumpled music professor. At times, occupying the moral high
ground can seem just as important to them as surviving the
nail-biting battle of nerves with Moscow.
   Emerging from a lengthy session of the government's
anti-blockade commission, Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
is collared by a Lithuanian journalist who has a couple of
tricky suggestions. During World War II, Hitler forged
British money in an effort to destabilize its economy. Why
doesn't Lithuania do the same to the Soviet Union, the
journalist asks. And why doesn't it ask Lithuanian women to
donate their wedding rings to be melted down and sold abroad
for precious hard currency?
   Mrs. Prunskiene, a 47-year-old economist dubbed
Lithuania's Margaret Thatcher, grins. Lithuania would rather
print its own currency, she says. As for the rings,
"Lithuanian men aren't going to let women donate all their
jewelry."
   Behind the scenes, the Lithuanians can be pragmatists.
Officials have spent two weeks knocking on doors in Moscow,
signaling a willingness to compromise on at least part of
their independence declaration. Though they refuse to tear it
up, there is talk of a suspension in return for the start of
formal independence negotiations. The chances of a diplomatic
solution along these lines received a boost after West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of
France made a similar plea over the weekend.
   Hard-line Lithuanian activists reject any retreat from
their independence drive. "It would mean jail again,"
complained Donatas Davicsa, a bearded campaigner from the
Lithuanian Freedom League, during a small protest rally
outside Parliament. As a U.S. television camera spots him, he
holds up a placard, which declares: "Freedom is light for
wich (sic) many have died in darkness."
   Vytautas Zemaitis is less critical. He has spent an hour
sitting in his battered green Moskvich auto, waiting in line
for his monthly quota of seven gallons of gasoline. The
blockade is "a good lesson," he says. "Self-awareness is very
important." Turning effusive, he adds, "In the month we have
had our independence, we have crossed out all the propaganda
we have had to put up with for 40 years."
   Little seems amiss during a stroll around town. There are
fewer private cars than normal and buses are crammed. Several
traffic lights have been switched off to save energy, but a
big neon sign by the town center flashes news headlines and
commercials. As ever, stores are much better stocked with
food and clothes than the ones in Moscow and prices in the
market haven't risen much. Though the Soviets have cut back
sharply on deliveries of natural gas, which most Lithuanians
use for heat and cooking, there is still enough to live on.
   It's a different story at industrial plants in town.
Supplies of natural gas, ball bearings and metal have been
slashed at the factory that makes parts for diesel-tractor
engines, forcing the shutdown of some lines. Two hundred of
the 7,000 workers have taken their vacation early.
   On a line churning out fuel pumps, Algis Tetravicius
shouts above the din of machinery. "Of course I support
Lithuanian independence," he says, wiping his hands on his
grimy blue overalls. But faced with the prospect of
unemployment, he has some doubts about the ability of the
republic's leadership to end the crisis. "Landsbergis is not
so good," he frets. "He's a philosopher."
   The engine plant, however, is one reason why Mr.
Landsbergis and other officials are convinced a prolonged
Soviet economic blockade will backfire. It is the sole
supplier of certain key parts for Soviet engines. If it stops
functioning, two big tractor factories in Minsk and Vladimir
will grind to a standstill, says Alfonsas Spudis, the deputy
director of the plant. The Soviets won't be able to shift to
imports because the parts are made to special Soviet
specifications, he says.
   As a result, Mr. Spudis says that even as Mr. Gorbachev
tightens the economic blockade of Lithuania, the ministry for
autos and tractors in Moscow is trying to break it, arranging
for deliveries of key materials to the plant.
   Across town, at the plastics factory, the story is
similar. It sends 80% of its production to Soviet republics.
Now that its energy supply has been cut drastically and
deliveries of polyethylene and polystyrene have ground to a
halt, the plants in the other republics won't be able to keep
operating much longer.
   "I don't understand politics. It's a children's game,"
says Mr. Andriunas, the factory official. Ironically, the few
items the plant can continue producing for some time are
mainly plastic containers sold in Lithuania. They include
sturdy canisters for gasoline. "The trouble is, " Mr.
Andriunas sighs, "There's no gasoline in Lithuania."
