   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed certain debt
and preferred stock of Bank of Boston Corp. on CreditWatch
with negative implications, following the company's report
Thursday of a 50% drop in first-quarter earnings.
   S&amp;P said the first-quarter results "indicate that asset
quality continues to deteriorate, resulting in risk-adjusted
capital levels that are low relative to peers."

   The ratings under review include those for the company's
triple-B-plus senior debt, triple-B subordinated debt,
triple-B-minus preferred stock, and single-A-2 commercial
paper. Also on CreditWatch are First National Bank of
Boston's single-A-minus/single-A-2 letter of credit-backed
issues and certificates of deposit, and single-A-2 commercial
paper programs of units Boston Australia Ltd. and Bank of
Boston Canada, which are fully guaranteed by First National
Bank of Boston.
   About $800 million of debt is affected.
   The ratings will remain on CreditWatch "until S&amp;P meets
with Bank of Boston's management to discuss asset quality and
capital issues," the rating agency said. The bank's senior
debt rating is expected to remain in investment grade, "even
if an adverse rating action is made subsequent to the
management discussions," S&amp;P said.
   A Bank of Boston spokesman said the company is "obviously
disappointed that Standard &amp; Poor's has put us on their watch
list. We expect to be meeting with the agency very soon to
discuss the details of our banking operations and help
alleviate their concerns."
