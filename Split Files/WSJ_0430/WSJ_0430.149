   LVMH MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON S.A. (Paris) -- Bernard
Arnault, chairman of this French luxury-goods group, said a
successor has been found for Henry Racamier, who resigned
Thursday as chairman of Louis Vuitton S.A. Mr. Arnault said
Jean Dromer, currently president of Societe Financiere
Agache, will take the reins at the luggage and leather-goods
unit. Mr. Racamier resigned following the Paris Court of
Appeal's announcement Thursday of its decision not to cancel
a bond issue that helped consolidate power within LVMH in the
hands of Mr. Arnault. Mr. Racamier launched several court
cases challenging the bonds.
