   FRANKFURT -- East Germany is considering selling half of
its nationalized industries to its own citizens through the
distribution of investment certificates, a key economic
official said.
   Peter Moreth, head of the East German trustee agency for
public property, told the West German daily Die Welt that
only the remaining half of the industrial holdings will be
offered to foreign investors. That 50% share open to
foreigners also includes all joint ventures and cooperation
pacts signed to date, he said.

   The trustee agency was set up earlier this year to take
over so-called publicly owned companies, and privatize them
at a later point.
