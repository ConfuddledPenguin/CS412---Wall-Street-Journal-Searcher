   WASHINGTON -- The U.S., signaling that it prefers
cooperation to confrontation in trade issues, declined to
name any new countries as unfair traders and called the
successful completion of multilateral trade-liberalization
talks its top priority.
   The Bush administration, despite heavy pressure, dropped
Japan from the list of unfair traders. But the administration
again cited India for unfair trade practices in investment
and insurance. India was designated last year along with
Japan and Brazil under terms of the "Super 301" provision of
the 1988 trade act.

   While the U.S. has in recent months reached agreements
with Brazil and Japan, "we have made no progress whatsoever
with India. I really couldn't refrain from naming them," U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills said. The U.S. is likely to
take trade retaliatory measures against India July 15.
   India criticized the U.S. action, and few observers there
think it will lead to policy changes soon. The Super 301
citation is "against all the tenets of multilateralism," and
India won't negotiate trade policies under U.S. threats,
Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh said.
   But, by substituting the current multilateral talks under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for new Super 301
designations, the U.S. is sidestepping potentially disruptive
quarrels with other trading partners and putting its best
efforts behind the GATT talks, which are to be completed this
year.
   Those talks "are the most promising route for creating new
opportunities for American industry and agriculture and
strengthening the global trading system," President Bush
said.
   The GATT round coincides with the second, and last, year
for Super 301, which requires the White House trade
representative to name the nation's top trade priorities and
designate countries that maintain egregious barriers to
foreign trade. The administration is then required to
negotiate those barriers away within 12 months to 18 months.
Failure to do so carries the threat of trade retaliation.
   The deadline for designating unfair trade practices under
Super 301 was April 30. There had been substantial lobbying
from the Congress and the Commerce Department for Japan to be
named again, and there now is some anger at the failure to do
so. Last year Japan accounted for about half the nation's
$100 billion trade deficit.
   Sen. John C. Danforth (R., Mo.) termed the decision
"deeply disappointing and a serious tactical mistake," while
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D., Mo.) said the
U.S. had given Japan "a free trade furlough."
   The administration vehemently rejects that view. "What was
a good tool 18 months ago isn't necessarily a good tool now,"
Mrs. Hills said, discussing Super 301. Japan, she argued, has
"moved farther and faster than any of our other trading
partners in the past 12 months." In the past year, the U.S.
and Japan have reached trade agreements covering
supercomputers, satellites, telecommunications and wood
products.
   But Mrs. Hills, who pays careful attention to Congress,
warned, "I have made it very clear that if I don't get the
results I want, I will use the tools I have."
   Some important trade hawks in Congress have also backed
away from outright condemnations of the administration's
approach: Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said he's glad some
designations were made, and contented himself with saying
he's "a bit of a skeptic as to whether recent agreements
{with Japan} will make much difference."
   "I hope that Congress will realize that we do have all
these checkpoints, and that those looking at it from a
non-partisan point of view should be satisfied," Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher said. "The president very wisely
asked Carla {Hills} for an expanded semiannual report which
will be due in the fall," and will give the administration a
chance to review the progress on enacting bilateral trade
agreements with Japan, the commerce chief added.
   In the meantime, the administration is throwing its weight
behind the GATT talks. They represent "a unique opportunity
to commit nearly 100 countries," including the European
Community and Japan, "to open their markets fully, and to
trade freely and fairly," said Mrs. Hills.
   In those talks, the U.S. is particularly pursuing five
goals: increased market access, with the aim of a tariff-free
world; fundamental reform of agricultural trade; agreed rules
in the new areas of trade in services, investment and
intellectual property; curbs on trade-distorting subsidies;
and integration of the developing world into the trading
system. The GATT talks are known as the Uruguay Round because
they were launched at a multilateral meeting in that
country's seaside resort of Punta del Este.
   Partly because of the GATT round, this year's approach to
Super 301 was much more sober than that in 1989. At that
time, the administration was prepared to rattle the sabers
with Congress, brand other countries as unfair traders and
even joke about it.
   In Mrs. Hills's conference room here, a message about last
year's Super 301 -- signed by President Bush and dated June
29, 1989 -- adorns the wall. It shows Mr. Bush standing with
his hands over his eyes. He has inscribed it: "The 301 award
1989 given to Carla Hills. Shown here is the president just
having heard from Sarney, Gandhi and Uno" (the respective
political leaders of Brazil, India and Japan at that date).
   The administration also again this year held back from
specifically designating countries under so-called Special
301, a clause of the 1988 trade act that covers unfair
practices in intellectual property such as patents, software
and copyrights.
   As it did last year, the administration published two
watch lists to put transgressors on notice: a "priority watch
list" that includes Brazil, China, India and Thailand, and an
ordinary watch list that includes Argentina, Canada, Chile,
Colombia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South
Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia,
Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
