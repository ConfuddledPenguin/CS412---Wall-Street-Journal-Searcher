   DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said the Midland
Cogeneration Venture will sell 200 megawatts of power to
Ontario Hydro, Canada's largest electric utility, from May
through September.
   A CMS spokesman described the transaction as the first
major sale for the Midland Cogeneration Venture, but he
wouldn't provide a dollar value for the deal. CMS is a
49%-owner of the Midland Cogeneration Venture.

in 1984. The plant was reopened on March 16 as a gas-fired
plant.
