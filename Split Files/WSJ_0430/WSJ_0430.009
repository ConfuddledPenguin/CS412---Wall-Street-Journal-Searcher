   Apple Computer Inc. slashed prices on its sole portable
computer, in an effort to lift sluggish sales of the machine.
   The company cut the suggested price of the portable 15.3%
to $5,499. The price of a version of the same model with
fewer features was cut 17.2% to $4,799.

   Analysts said that the price reduction should improve
sales, but that Apple's portables remain more expensive than
comparable machines from Compaq Computer Corp. and others.
"The discounts aren't enough," said Bruce M. Lupatkin, an
analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
   At 16 pounds, Apple's portable is considered too heavy and
bulky to win wide acceptance at a time when competitors are
offering slimmer, lighter models for one-third less money in
some cases. Apple's dealers have reported
weaker-than-expected interest in the machine, and some
analysts have sharply scaled back sales projections.
   "Frankly, the product simply isn't selling well," said
Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
   Apple doesn't disclose sales figures for the portable and
won't comment on its plans for this segment of the computer
business, which grew an estimated 40% last year, far faster
than the growth in desktop computers.
   However, industry observers believe Apple is discussing
plans to hire an independent firm to manufacture a new
portable because it isn't sure it can build a small, light
machine inexpensively enough. They say that Apple plans to
design the machine and that Sony Corp., which supplies
monitors to Apple, is among the possible builders.
   Such a move would be a major departure for Apple, which
currently manufactures all its computers. The company,
however, does rely heavily on a variety of suppliers for such
critical parts as monitors, storage devices and keyboards.
   An Apple spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny that the
company is considering contracting out the manufacture of a
future portable. She would say only that discussions are
routinely held on various topics with Apple's suppliers,
including Sony.
   Industry observers say that Apple hasn't decided how it
will proceed, and that, in any case, it is working on new
portable computers that can complement its current offering.
