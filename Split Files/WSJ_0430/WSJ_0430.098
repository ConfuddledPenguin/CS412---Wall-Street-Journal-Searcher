   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh withdrew the Justice
Department's support for tough new mandatory sentencing
guidelines to punish corporations convicted of crimes.
   The action last month came after intense lobbying of the
Bush administration by major companies claiming the proposed
guidelines were too severe and after White House Counsel C.
Boyden Gray raised concerns about the matter with Mr.
Thornburgh's top aide.

   The guidelines, under consideration by the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, would require federal judges to impose large
fines -- in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars -- on
companies convicted of such crimes as cheating on government
contracts and polluting.
   Mr. Thornburgh has endorsed stiff sentences of convicted
companies and corporate executives. His spokesman, David
Runkel, tried to minimize the significance of the withdrawal
of support for the guidelines, saying the shift in position
came because the attorney general hasn't had an opportunity
to review the proposed guidelines personally.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) criticized the
department's "about-face," which he said "comes at time when
increasing numbers of Americans are being victimized by
fraudulent government contractors" and other corporate
wrongdoers. The Washington Post reported Mr. Thornburgh's
action Saturday.
   In February, Donald Ayer, the deputy attorney general,
wrote to the Sentencing Commission, formally reiterating the
Justice Department's "strong support" for more-stringent
mandatory sentences for corporate criminals. Subsequently,
lobbyists and trade associations representing numerous major
companies protested to the Bush administration that the
guidelines were too harsh.
   Mr. Gray, the White House counsel, called Mr. Thornburgh's
executive assistant, Robert Ross, to say the president's
staff wanted to be "a part of the review process," according
to Mr. Runkel. The attorney general, who hadn't been aware of
Mr. Ayer's earlier endorsement, then ordered that a new
letter be sent to the Sentencing Commission, withdrawing the
Justice Department's backing while the administration studied
the guidelines further, Mr. Runkel added.
   Mr. Ayer committed "a procedural mistake" by failing to
clear the earlier supportive letter with the attorney
general, Mr. Runkel said. But "the whole thing is
meaningless," the spokesman added, because the seven-member
Sentencing Commission has three vacancies and has postponed
further action on corporate guidelines until next year.
   The commission, established by Congress in 1984 to force
greater uniformity in federal sentencing, previously imposed
mandatory guidelines for a wide array of crimes committed by
individuals.

   IMMIGRATION RULES are reducing chances of easing nursing
shortage.
   Immigration lawyers and the health-care industry are
finding that a new law meant to alleviate a shortage of
nurses in the U.S. may have little impact because of strict
rules adopted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The bill, signed into law in December, was expected to
enable 16,000 foreign-citizen registered nurses to remain in
the U.S. as permanent residents. The bill was spurred by
changes in immigration law that would have required the
nurses, mainly from the Philippines, to leave the country for
a year before seeking to renew their work visas. When the
bill was passed, health officials -- already facing a severe
shortage of nurses -- said some hospitals in New York City
and other urban areas might have to close if the nurses
weren't allowed to stay.
   But now, immigration lawyers say that under the INS's
rules for implementing the law, less than half of the nurses
will qualify. Most of the nurses will be disqualified, the
lawyers say, because at some point during the past three
years they worked overtime at hospitals other than their main
employer. Because their visas only allowed them to work at
assigned hospitals, that extra work was illegal, the lawyers
say. The INS has said only nurses who never worked illegally
during the past three years can qualify under the new law.
   "There was an urgent need for nurses in these hospitals.
As a result, many of these nurses moonlighted," said Hyman
Abrams, an immigration lawyer in New York with many Filipino
clients. He said immigration lawyers were led to believe
additional work wouldn't violate a work visa as long as it
was in a related field.
   "The purpose of the law was to assist hospitals, which
have a tremendous shortage of nurses," Mr. Abrams said.
"They're defeating the purpose of the law by not opening it
up a little bit."
   Katherine Abelson, executive vice president of a New York
City health-care workers' union that helped draft the law,
said she was shocked when an INS official told a meeting of
union members that many foreign nurses wouldn't qualify.
   "The health-care system is going to face quite a problem,
given the INS's rules and regulations for enforcing the law,"
Ms. Abelson said. "You take these nurses away in the city,
and it will look like the hospitals are on strike." She said
some hospitals in New York already are 25% short of the
registered nurses they need.
   Many of the foreign nurses, when they first came to the
U.S., worked in hospitals at a level below registered nurse
while waiting to pass their state-licensing exams, said Ms.
Abelson. Lawyers said such work disqualifies them under the
new law. Another problem is that the law makes no provisions
for the nurses' spouses or children; although the nurses may
qualify for permanent residency, their families would have to
wait years before legally residing in the U.S.
   A spokesman for Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who was
instrumental in getting the bill passed, said the
congressman's office is aware of the situation.
   "We think it's more of a problem of technicalities," he
said. The spokesman said corrective legislation is being
drafted to get around the disqualifying conditions that the
INS is applying. He said the proposed legislation will also
provide for nurses' family members.
   An INS spokesman said the agency is merely enforcing the
requirements of the law. "This law is not meant to {give
permanent residency} to every nurse in the U.S.," he said.
"We have no authority to broaden the criteria.

   FRAUDULENT SCHEME in "secured" credit-card program is
alleged in suit.
   Secured credit cards allow people who have poor credit
ratings to establish a credit line by putting down a deposit
that can be used to cover any unpaid charges. If the card is
canceled, cardholders get the money back.
   But a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, N.Y.,
accuses four banks and financial companies of taking part in
a scheme to defraud thousands of secured-card applicants. The
suit charges that deposits made for the accounts were used to
pay prior obligations, rather than being invested in
interest-earning accounts as promised. The suit claims that
applicants were deceived into applying for the accounts based
on the belief that their deposits would be invested and
protected.
   The suit names as defendants Universal Bank of Maryland,
Trust Co. Bank of Atlanta, Security Trust Co. of Arlington,
Texas, and Liberty Securities Group Inc. of New York City. A
lawyer for Universal Bank couldn't be reached for comment. A
Trust Co. Bank spokesman said he was unaware of the suit and
couldn't comment. A Security Trust spokeswoman said the
thrift is a failed entity and will be closing in a few weeks.
Liberty Securities is no longer operating.
   The suit's allegations involve a secured credit-card
program operated by MoneyCard Systems Inc. of Washington,
D.C., which went bankrupt in 1988. The suit accuses Universal
Bank, Security Trust and Trust Co. Bank of authorizing
MoneyCard to administer Visa and MasterCard secured-card
accounts without disclosing the arrangement to customers. The
suit also accuses the defendants of falsely claiming that the
customers' deposits were being held in investment accounts.
   Michael Malakoff, an attorney for the cardholders, said
banks are prohibited under their Visa and MasterCard
agreements from hiring independent agents -- such as
MoneyCard -- to administer their programs.

   LAW FIRM'S PAYMENT to Texaco-Pennzoil trial judge is
questioned.
   Baker &amp; Botts, a Houston firm which represented Pennzoil
Co., paid Solomon Casseb Jr. $25,000 eight months before he
was named to hear Pennzoil's suit against Texaco Inc. At the
time, Mr. Casseb was a retired judge and practicing lawyer,
and had no connection with the Texaco-Pennzoil case. He was
reimbursed for helping Baker &amp; Botts in unrelated litigation
over an oil and gas field near Laredo, Texas, the law firm
said.
   Pennzoil went on to win a $10.53 billion jury verdict
against Texaco in 1985, the largest civil verdict in history.
Mr. Casseb, who succeeded the original trial judge who became
ill, was the first judge to uphold the verdict. The case
ultimately was settled for $3 billion.
   The $25,000 fee was first brought to light by Texas
Lawyer, a trade publication, which raised questions about
whether the payment should have been disclosed when Mr.
Casseb was appointed to hear the Texaco-Pennzoil case. The
payment is one of numerous expenses being disputed in a legal
malpractice suit alleging that Baker &amp; Botts overcharged its
clients in the Laredo case.
   E. William Barnett, Baker &amp; Botts's managing partner,
contends Mr. Casseb was hired as a consultant in the Laredo
litigation and was simply being reimbursed for those
services. He also contends that the arrangement with Mr.
Casseb in the Laredo case has no relation to his subsequent
appointment as judge in the Texaco-Pennzoil litigation.
   "He was just a lawyer functioning in a case with us," says
Mr. Barnett. Mr. Casseb couldn't be reached.
