   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge dismissed conspiracy and
fraud charges against Thomas Muldoon, a defense-industry
consultant already convicted on separate charges stemming
from his role in the Pentagon bribery and procurement
scandal.
   Judge Albert Bryan in Alexandria, Va., dismissed last
month's indictment of Mr. Muldoon for allegedly funneling
sensitive bid-related information to major defense
contractors. In his ruling, Judge Bryan agreed with defense
motions that prosecutors may have unfairly singled out Mr.
Muldoon for tough treatment by seeking a second round of
felony charges against him.

   Mr. Muldoon, who has consistently refused to cooperate
with prosecutors, is appealing his earlier conviction and
27-month prison sentence on charges of scheming to bribe a
Navy acquisition official.
   Prosecutors have described Mr. Muldoon as an important
player in the procurement scandal, dubbed "Operation Ill
Wind." The government contends that the second indictment was
proper because it dealt with a separate conspiracy and a
different set of government and industry officials than those
mentioned in Mr. Muldoon's earlier indictment.
