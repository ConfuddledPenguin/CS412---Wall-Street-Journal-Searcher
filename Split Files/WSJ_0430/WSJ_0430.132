   NEW YORK -- The head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s
branch network, William A. Buckingham, resigned to take a
similar position with Buffalo-based First Empire State Corp.
   Mr. Buckingham, 47 years old, is highly regarded within
Manufacturers, and his departure, according to bank
executives, was for "life-style reasons." Mr. Buckingham, an
executive vice president, and his wife are both from the
Buffalo region. Mr. Buckingham couldn't be reached.

   In an internal bank memo, Vice Chairman Edward Miller said
he accepted Mr. Buckingham's resignation "with deepest
regret."
   Since Manufacturers encountered some liquidity problems
following the failure of Continental Illinois Bank in the
early 1980s, Mr. Buckingham played an important role in
increasing the bank's consumer-deposit base.
   Last year, Manufacturers' core deposits accounted for 25%
of net liabilities, up from 22% in 1988.
   No successor has been named.
