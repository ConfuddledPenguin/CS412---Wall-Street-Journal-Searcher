   BOSTON -- Federal thrift regulators took over the
Burlington, Mass., headquarters of Home Owners Savings Bank,
and a smaller Massachusetts bank disclosed that it is seeking
assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision placed Home Owners under
government conservatorship and appointed Resolution Trust
Corp. to manage the institution -- the first such action in
Massachusetts since the passage of the thrift bailout law.
Conservatorship allows the institution to conduct business.
But it is often a prelude to a government-assisted sale or
liquidation. With $3.6 billion in assets, Home Owners is one
of the biggest thrifts in New England.

   On Friday, the Office of Thrift Supervision said it placed
Home Owners under conservatorship because it "was operating
in an unsafe and unsound manner." The company is a former
high-flying institution that built a nationwide
mortgage-banking operation in the 1980s. The agency said Home
Owners had tangible capital of negative $106.3 million as of
Dec. 31.
   Meanwhile, Home National Corp. of Milford, Mass., said it
expects a $4.8 million first-quarter loss to reduce its
shareholders' equity to a deficit of at least $4.1 million. A
spokesman for Home National, which has $486 million in
assets, said the bank's proposal calls for shareholders to
"retain a percentage of the company." But the company
wouldn't provide further details. An FDIC spokesman said the
agency hasn't made a decision on the request.
