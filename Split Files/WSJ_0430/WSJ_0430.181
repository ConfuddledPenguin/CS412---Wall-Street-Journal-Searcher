   CANBERRA -- Australia's cotton crop has been damaged by
widespread rains that have flooded much of eastern Australia.
   A spokesman for the Australian Bureau of Agricutural and
Resource Economics said the quality of cotton will have been
spoiled by the heavy rains and this will lower export
returns.

   In December, the bureau estimated that Australia's cotton
exports would total 508 million Australian dollars (US$383.2
million) for the year ending June 30.
