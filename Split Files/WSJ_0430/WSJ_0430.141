   FIRST FIDELITY BANCORP. (Newark, N.J.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. downgraded about $710 million of
securities of First Fidelity Bancorp. and its units. The debt
rating agency said earnings of the bank holding company would
continue to be affected by the weakening quality of its
assets, especially its real estate portfolio. It added,
however, that First Fidelity should benefit from significant
cost savings as a result of consolidating operations and
initiatives undertaken by new management. Among the
downgrades, Moody's lowered the rating on First Fidelity's
subordinated debt to Baa3 from Baa2. It reduced to Baa3 from
Baa1 the rating on the company's preferred stock. The rating
on the long-term deposits of First Fidelity Bank unit was
reduced to single-A-3 from single-A-2, while the rating on
short-term deposits was dropped to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
Subordinated debt for the Fidelcor Inc. unit was downgraded
to Baa3 from Baa2.
