   NEW YORK -- An important barometer of Wall Street's health
has hit the lowest level in four years.
   The "value of trading" on the New York Stock Exchange --
essentially the volume multiplied by average stock prices --
fell to $5.5 billion daily in the first quarter, less than
any 1989 quarter and about 26% below the 1987 peak. The
quarter's pace languished near the 1986 level of $5.4 billion
daily.

   The Securities Industry Association, in a new report, says
the stock market is generating a "two-pronged attack on
revenues and profits." Stock-price weakness is adding to the
pressure from continuing low volume. That explains why so
many big brokerage companies continue to suffer financially
even 2 1/2 years after the 1987 stock-market crash.
   Value of trading is important because trading commissions
are usually a percentage of the value of a transaction. When
stock prices go down, brokers make less money on each trade.
These days, "not only is the industry selling less products,
but it is selling those products at lower prices," the
securities association report says.
   The shares of publicly traded brokerage companies are
languishing. The securities brokers group of the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index is down 9.2% this year.
   Sluggish trading volume since the 1987 crash has torpedoed
the securities industry's profits. The industry overall had
losses of $92 million in the fourth quarter, according to Big
Board data. But at least stock prices had been rising-up to
this year. No more.
   In the first quarter, trading volume fell 2%, stock prices
declined roughly 4% and the average price of a share traded
fell 5% to $34.60, the securities association said.
   One analyst who tracks value-of-trading statistics,
Michael Goldstein of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., says the
falling stock market along with mediocre volume has meant a
"double whammy" for brokerage companies.
   "The whole industry is based on the value of the trading,
so if value contracts, their share of the value contracts,"
Mr. Goldstein says. Mr. Goldstein is projecting that brokers'
production of commissions will be down roughly 10% from last
year's base. Last year, broker production had risen along
with soaring stock prices, in one of the few positive
developments for Wall Street.
   Without those rising stock prices, there would have been
even more layoffs and disappointing earnings at brokerage
companies, analysts say. Last year, the market soared about
27%. But through Friday, the market this year is down nearly
7%.
   With trading profits and investment gains accounting for
one-fourth of Wall Street revenue in the 1980s, "lower
securities prices generate real profit problems for the
industry," says Jeffrey M. Schaefer, the securities
association's research director. "Any industry is crippled if
a basic measure of sales is no higher than that reached four
years earlier."
   Dean P. Eberling, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
says he is optimistic about the securities industry for the
long haul, but that it is "in for a very rough period as far
as sentiment on these (brokerage) stocks." Last year's second
quarter was a good one for both volume and prices. That means
that this year's second-quarter earnings are likely to be
clunkers compared with the year-earlier periods, analysts
say.
   What saved brokerage companies in the 1990 first quarter
was bond trading and currency exchange. While the value of
corporate bond trading fell to $14.1 billion after three
consecutive quarterly increases, institutions were net buyers
daily of $908 million of corporate bonds, the highest buying
level since the first quarter of 1987, the securities
association says. Rising interest rates were a "strong
magnet" for institutions to buy bonds, the association notes,
especially with memories of the 1987 crash lingering.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter
averaged slightly more than 160 million shares daily -- the
lowest tally since the 1988 fourth quarter's 145 million
shares -- with volume declining each month.
   The American Stock Exchange enjoyed a better trend.
First-quarter volume averaged 14.6 million shares daily, the
highest quarterly average in three years. Much of the
increase was from the Nikkei put warrants that began trading
in January, giving investors a way to bet against the
Japanese stock market. These warrants at times have accounted
for as much as 40% of Amex volume, and 15% overall in the
quarter, says the association.
   Volume trends on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market were
comparable in the quarter to the Big Board's. Nasdaq volume
averaged 132.2 million shares, about flat with the 1989
average but still 11% below the 1987 peak. Still,
institutions hoping that smaller stocks would soar helped net
purchases -- or purchases minus sales -- of Nasdaq stocks
soar to 2.2 million shares a day in the quarter, far
surpassing earlier years.
   The drop-off in stock business wouldn't faze Wall Street
were it not for the inertia in the once-lucrative investment
banking businesses. Both stock and bond underwritings are
under pressure. Public underwritten corporate debt fell to
$70 billion in the first quarter from $83.5 billion in the
fourth quarter; stock underwriting fell to $7.1 billion from
$8 billion. There were also drops in mortgage-backed and
municipal securities, while high-yield, high-risk junk bond
underwritings "almost disappeared" in the first quarter, says
the securities association report.
