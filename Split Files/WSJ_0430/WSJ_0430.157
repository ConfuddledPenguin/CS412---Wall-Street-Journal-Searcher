   Midway Airlines, stung by high fuel costs, reported a
deeper-than-expected net loss of $22.9 million, or $2.39 a
share, for the first quarter.
   A year earlier, net income was $2.9 million, or 17 cents a
share. Revenue rose 34% to $157.2 million from $117.3
million.

   The Chicago-based carrier said its bottom line is still
being affected by costs associated with the start-up of a
Philadelphia hub of operations. Midway has been expanding
service out of Philadelphia since November. Until then, its
only hub of operations was at Chicago's Midway Airport.
   Last summer, Midway Chairman David Hinson cautioned that
it might take a year before the expansion in Philadelphia
contributes substantially to the company's earnings.
   Although Midway didn't disclose how much its fuel costs
rose in the first quarter, many Wall Street analysts are
estimating that average prices surged 25% to 30% from a year
earlier. For that reason, most airlines have been reporting
losses for the first quarter.
   Midway's first-quarter operating expenses rose 61% to
$183.3 million from $113.7 million the year earlier.
