   PARIS -- The average unemployment rate in 16 Western
industrialized countries in February was 6%, unchanged from
the previous two months, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
   Jobless rates in North America and Japan were unchanged,
while West Germany, Italy and Britain experienced a mild
easing, and Australian unemployment drifted higher. The OECD
said the standardized unemployment rate fell in five of the
six countries for which March data are available, while
unemployment in the sixth country, Belgium, was unchanged.
