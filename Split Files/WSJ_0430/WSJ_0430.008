   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's biggest trade
union is gearing up for strikes to back demands for less work
and more pay, ignoring government calls for moderation ahead
of the costly merger of the two German economies.
   The powerful IG Metall metalworkers union threatened to
break off contract talks and call for a strike ballot in
mid-May if a settlement isn't reached by May 8. A series of
brief warning strikes have been scheduled for this week.

   Franz Steinkuehler, IG Metall's chairman, expressed hope
an agreement could be reached, but said this hope "is not
justified when one looks at the facts."
   Management and labor negotiators are deadlocked over IG
Metall's demands for a 9% wage increase, work-free weekends
and a reduction in the official working week to 35 hours from
the current 37.
   While many labor analysts consider a protracted strike
unlikely, government officials worry that hefty wage
concessions could add an inflationary element to the West
German economy at an inopportune time. Moreover, they
question the readiness of the union's pampered rank-and-file
to follow a strike call.
   IG Metall isn't budging. Tightly organized and granted
board representation under liberal co-determination laws,
West Germany's labor unions already have secured the highest
wages and shortest work shifts in Europe. IG Metall, which
has targeted this year to achieve a 35-hour working week,
isn't listening to government appeals for moderation to avoid
jeopardizing economic union with East Germany.
   As Western Europe's largest union, with 2.6 million
members in the metals, automotive and computer sectors, IG
Metall more than once has had a hand in shaping industry
policy. Its last formal strike, in 1984, idled West Germany's
entire automotive industry for seven weeks, costing billions
of marks in lost profits and hobbling Europe's largest
economy.
   Warning strikes, usually one- or two-hour work stoppages
at selected plants to back threats of a permanent walkout,
have become a standard ritual in West German labor talks. Few
analysts say they believe the conflict will escalate to a
full-scale walkout this time.
   The Gesamtmetall employers association, which negotiates
contracts for industry, has signaled it is willing to sweeten
its latest offer of a 5% wage increase. Moreover, it also has
shown willingness to give ground on the work-week issue --
which could end up being written into contracts now for
implementation later.
   Gesamtmetall Chief Dieter Kirchner urged industry to
maintain its nerve, claiming management and labor aren't that
far apart. "Given IG Metall's self-styled image as a
conflict-oriented union, nobody expected a compromise prior
to the expiration of the grace period," Mr. Kirchner said.
"Few would sympathize with a major strike at a time when the
German-German economic and social union is set to start on
July 2," he said.
   Most economists are less worried about strikes than the
cost of avoiding them. West Germany's construction workers
already got a 5.8% wage increase this year. The printers'
union also is threatening strikes to back demands for hefty
wage increases and a shorter working week.
   This year's labor-contract talks have spurred concern at
the Bundesbank, which reckons wage increases will boost
inflationary pressures expected to come from monetary union
and a full production capacity after eight years of growth.
The combination of price factors has prompted warnings of a
clampdown on monetary growth with interest-rate increases
later in the year.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl warned late last week
that economic strains are multiplying as a result of strong
domestic demand. "Though only half of the work force are due
for new contracts, it could result in new strains by 1991 at
the latest if the wrong guidelines are set," Mr. Poehl said.
