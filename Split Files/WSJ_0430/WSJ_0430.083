   WASHINGTON -- Israel has tentatively agreed to sell heavy
water back to Norway in an effort to avoid an inspection of
its secret nuclear weapons facilities.
   In a proposed agreement announced by Norway's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Norway agreed to drop its request to inspect
Israel's use of 21 metric tons of heavy water that it sold
Israel in 1959.

   In return, Israel agreed to sell back half of the heavy
water, 10.5 metric tons, to Norway for $1.8 million. The rest
of the heavy water, according to Israel, has been used or
lost in normal reactor operations.
   Heavy water is an isotope, or close chemical relative of
water, which is used to cool and control some types of
nuclear reactors. Norway has been concerned about the sale
since 1987 when news reports showed that Israel was operating
a large nuclear reactor at Dimona as part of its nuclear
weapons program.
   The nuclear reactor's main function is believed to be to
produce plutonium, the most commonly used explosive in
nuclear weapons. Under the initial sale contract in 1959,
Norway held inspection rights to ensure that the heavy water
was being used only for peaceful purposes. During the lengthy
negotiations that ensued, Israel refused to give Norway's
inspectors access to Dimona.
   "This agreement was done to full satisfaction of both
sides," said Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman for Israel's Embassy in
Washington. It replaces the old agreement, she explained, and
ends Norway's inspection rights.
   Gary Milhollin, the head of a Washington-based research
center that tracks nuclear materials, was the first to trace
the heavy water in the Israeli reactor to Norway. He says
that he believes that some of the material may still remain
in Israel's hands after the 10.5 tons return to Norway.
   The normal heavy water loss rate for the type of reactor
Israel is using, according to Mr. Milhollin, is 0.5% a year.
He calculates that as much as eight tons of the initial
shipment may remain useable by Israel at Dimona after the
10.5 tons are shipped back to Norway. "This is the first time
that a nuclear supplier (Norway) has neglected to enforce an
inspection pledge," he said.
   The accord still must be formally approved by Israel and
Norway, which must get budgetary approval from its parliament
for the repurchase.
   Meanwhile, the Norwegians are continuing to investigate
what happened to 12.5 tons of heavy water it sold Romania in
1986. The new Romanian government has produced documents that
suggest the heavy water was reshipped to India, in violation
of Romania's obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty.
