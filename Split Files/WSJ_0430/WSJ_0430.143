   For oil markets, this is OPEC Week.
   Barring oil field disasters or political upheavals
elsewhere, oil traders are looking to Geneva for the next few
days for clues about the direction of petroleum prices.
Nothing else matters much pending the meeting there of the
monitoring committee of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, beginning Wednesday.

   The outcome of such meetings is unpredictable, of course.
Still, there is a growing belief among oil analysts that the
result of this one will be a boost for petroleum prices. The
oil ministers are expected to confirm "voluntary" output cuts
to trim the glut.
   Just the fact that the meeting is being held already has
given support to oil prices, which fell rapidly in recent
weeks because of OPEC's excess output. Announced production
cuts not only should firm volatile prices but could lead to
further gains in the weeks ahead.
   Charles T. Maxwell, Cyrus J. Lawrence's vice chairman and
senior energy strategist, is among those expecting prices to
recover. "The reason the price will be getting better is
based on the assumption that OPEC will put it all together"
by bringing output down to some 23 million barrels a day from
the current 23.5 million, he said.
   Mr. Maxwell doesn't foresee an immediate turnaround. He
looks for the price of West Texas Intermediate crude,
currently posted at $17.50 a barrel, to drop a few cents more
in May but then to rebound by June. By August, he said the
WTI price should be up to $18 a barrel. He predicted a price
of $19 in September and $20 in October.
   WTI field postings by refiners generally lag those quoted
in futures trading. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June
WTI settled Friday at $18.54 a barrel, up three cents for the
week.
   The OPEC monitoring committee can't take action on its
own. The responsibility of the eight ministers on the
committee is to review oil markets and prices and make
recommendations. But all 13 oil ministers are due in Geneva
and could quickly turn the meeting into an emergency OPEC
conference that could take action.
   But that isn't likely. Instead, the meeting is expected to
be "quick and dirty," as one oil analyst puts it, concluding
after only one or two days. Hard decisions on production
quotas or OPEC's reference price, currently a fictional $18 a
barrel, will be postponed until the midyear conference, which
begins June 25.
   Still, the ministers must show a solid front for the sake
of the markets in order to keep oil prices from collapsing.
That's why it is widely anticipated in the industry they will
announce production cuts.
   "Although a disastrous outcome of {this week's} OPEC
meeting would mean a further fall for crude prices, it is
unlikely that such an outcome will occur," said John A.
Redpath, an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc., which
monitors world oil supplies.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Things could get off to a bang at the opening of trading
today.
   Prices of soybean futures contracts rallied Friday at the
Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that the National Weather
Service would issue a prediction for dry and hot weather for
the planting season, which is under way.
   After the close of trading, however, government
forecasters predicted near normal precipitation and
temperatures. As a result, prices might come under downward
pressure early.
   The influence of weather forecasts on commodity prices
will increase as planting gathers steam. But the spotlight
for much of the week will probably fall on the soybean
harvest in Brazil.
   Last week, soybean prices soared on signs that the
rain-slowed harvest in Brazil, a major soybean exporter,
might force some importing nations to buy more of the crop
from the U.S.
   The Soviet Union, for example, has been rumored to be
interested in buying as much as 400,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybean meal. This time of year it often buys from South
America.
   The soybean harvest in Brazil is about half complete.
Normally, 85% of the crop would be harvested by now, said
Walter Spilka, a grain analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co., New York.
                                                                                                       

   Copper
                                                                                                       

   Traders this week will be watching for a continuation of
the tight supplies that enabled the April futures contract to
command a 15-cent a pound premium over May when it expired
last Thursday.
   There had been concern that there wouldn't be enough
Commodity Exchange copper stocks to satisfy April contracts
outstanding. But a combination of contract liquidation and
strong inventory increases in the last two days allowed an
orderly April expiration.
   It was significant, though, that the April price didn't
weaken or collapse. In fact, the price at expiration actually
rose one cent a pound for the day.
   The market paused on Friday and eased slightly. Today is
the first day on which notices to deliver copper against May
futures contracts will be issued. Traders believe today's
market action may give a clue as to whether April's strength
will be extended to May.
   Statistics on May contracts outstanding and exchange
supplies are relatively meaningless at this point, but Comex
inventories continued to rise Friday, adding another 615 tons
for a total of 6,619 tons.
   According to one analyst, the key to whether the tightness
of supplies is real or just a technical, exchange-related
phenomenon will be the price spread between the May and July
contracts.
   As of the close Friday, May had an eight-cent premium over
July. "If it narrows, then supplies may really be more ample
than was thought. If it widens, then there is really a
tightness," he said.
   Giving some support to the latter view is the fact that
supplies haven't increased as quickly as had been expected,
in part as a result of a strike in Peru that began March 12
and may cause a loss of as much as 40,000 tons of refined
copper. There also are some production problems in Chile that
have caused cuts in output estimates, the analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar
                                                                                                       

   The May contract on Friday ran up more than 16 cents a
pound but couldn't hold that gain. A contributing factor
could have been the fact that the contract will expire today.
   Traders will be watching to see if the market holds on to
gains better this week, particularly since the world market
in effect has lost 250,000 tons that have been added to the
U.S. quota.
   In addition, European sugar beet planted acreage is down
from the original estimate and the crop still has to go
through its growing period. In the background, there are
recurrent rumors that Mexico, historically an exporter, may
seek to buy sugar to meet domestic needs and export
commitments. One analyst guessed that Mexico may have already
bought 600,000 tons and may need an additional 400,000 tons.
   Thailand's crop may fall short of expectations, one dealer
said. Output may amount to about 3.4 million tons, down from
an earlier projection of about four million tons.
   Trading in London sugar futures was cut short by a bomb
scare and the New York market's activity was curtailed by a
computer communications breakdown. "It was the first time in
history the two markets were down like that," said the
dealer, who has been in the market many years.
