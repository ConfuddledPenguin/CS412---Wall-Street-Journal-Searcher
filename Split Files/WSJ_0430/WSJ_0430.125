   Revco D.C. Inc. said in Twinsburg, Ohio, that it agreed to
sell 221 of its stores to Reliable Holdings Corp., which was
formed by Acadia Partners Limited Partnership and the
management of Reliable Drug Stores Inc. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The drugstore chain announced in January that it would
seek buyers for 712 of its 1,873 stores as part of a
corporate reorganization. The company filed for bankruptcy
court protection in July 1988.

   The transaction with Reliable Holdings is subject to
approval by a U.S. bankruptcy court. If the plan is approved,
Revco would sell all its stores in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and western Tennessee.
   Acadia Partners is a Fort Worth, Texas-based partnership
that includes Robert M. Bass. Last year a group led by the
Texas billionaire made an unsuccessful $925 million offer for
all of Revco.
   Reliable Drug Stores is a drugstore chain based in
Indianapolis.
