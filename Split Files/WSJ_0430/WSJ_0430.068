   In the March 19 article entitled "Brazil's Collor Stuns
Nation With Harsh Economic Plan," you reported that a measure
of the plan to deflate the Brazilian economy will be "the
creation of the fourth new currency in as many years, the
Cruzeiro, to replace the Cruzado Novo. . . ."
   The cruzeiro will replace the cruzado, but it is not, in
fact, "new." Brazil's currency was known as the cruzeiro
prior to Feb. 28, 1986. The replacement of the cruzeiro with
the cruzado came at a time when severe inflationary and
economic pressures were mounting in Brazil. In February 1986,
inflation was at a mere 500%, compared with current inflation
of more than 1,000%. At that time, the cruzeiro was trading
at an official rate of $12,000 and at a black-market rate of
$23,000. The Central Bank of Brazil designated the new
official rate of the cruzado novo at $12. Perhaps the central
bankers were tired of punching so many zeros into their
calculators.
