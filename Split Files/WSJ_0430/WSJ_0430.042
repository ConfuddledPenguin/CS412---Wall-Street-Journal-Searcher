   Glasgow, Scotland -- It's time to get out of the freezing
rain in the Barras, Glasgow's weekend junk market. It is also
time for lunch, which here is called dinner. The first tea
shop I find is cheap and cheerful. Inside, solitary men, and
ginger-haired ladies wedged into booths with their bundles
and freckled kids, already are tucking in: fried bread, eggs
and square sausages, scones, white and pink cakes, fish and
chips, in fact chips with everything. Dinner is washed down
with an orange syrup called Irn Bru, and perhaps followed by
a Kensitas Club (a brand known only to Glaswegians, who smoke
more cigarettes than any other Britons). The food tastes
great and it's not hard to believe that this city has claimed
the highest rate of heart disease in Europe. And the people
generally look unwell; I am beginning to make sense of the
Scots poet Mick Imlah's observation, "If people were
buildings, there would still be slums in Glasgow."
   Two prams for the price of one, eight cans of spaghetti
for a pound: Back out in the rain, the discount shops and
hawkers are doing brisk trade. Though nothing like it was --
a 1904 municipal report on housing conditions records 11
adults living in a room 10 feet square, and people sleeping
in layers (some on top of the bed and others underneath) --
Glasgow is poor.

   From this corner, the city's new status as this year's
Cultural Capital of Europe seems implausible and irrelevant,
even frivolous. In another part of town, however, the
distinct hiss of the cappuccino machine can now be heard.
Glassy new shopping arcades feature designer boutiques and
galleries. Wine bars with names like Berlin and Cafe Qui are
appearing as alternatives to Glasgow's undecorous
harddrinking pubs, where as recently as the 1970s women were
forbidden (and where even now they will be made to feel
mighty unwelcome if they dare enter). Drinking has been
astutely upheld as one of Glasgow's primary cultural
attractions. For this year only, European practice obtains:
Alcohol may be sold through the night, while the rest of
Britain is kept to its kindergarten curfew of 11 p.m.
   This is the new Glasgow, but everywhere in it the old one
stubbornly resides. Dramatic chiaroscuro buildings of creamy
and coal-blackened limestone suggest (if one imagines that
the only partial sandblasting is deliberate) what is perhaps
an ambivalence here about the city's changing image. This
used to be a place where things were made; is it now to be
merely one in which they are on display? Most of the
shipyards down on the river Clyde are gone, and most of the
redundant docks have been filled in; one quay has become the
site of a 300-room hotel and an enormous bright-red
exhibition center. Nearby, a remaining crane, which used to
sweep 100-ton locomotives onto ships, is an impressive
monument to the vanished industry that made Glasgow.
Occasionally a sculpture -- a tiny parcel in the distance --
is hung from it: That's really putting culture in
perspective.
   Though many individual Glaswegians are characteristically
wry and self-mocking about their new status, the official
version is serious to the tune of $66 million, which is being
spent on special events, festivals, championships, publicity.
If some of this year's Culture is sprayed on (sometimes
literally, as in the conversion of buses, with daubs of
paint, into "public art"), there are plenty of long-lived
reasons for thinking of Glasgow as something other than the
place where football hooliganism was invented. The Scottish
National Orchestra, the Scottish Opera and the Ballet live
here; as do the Citizens' Theatre and the Tramway, where
Philip Glass's "Mahabharata" played last year. The Burrell
Collection, an impressive bequest of paintings and objects
from a native collector, is one of several good museums.
Charles Rennie Mackintosh gave the city a few great modern
buildings (as well as a style that appears, somewhat
doggedly, as a motif in all sorts of placesit has even
inspired the stained plastic fixtures of Glasgow's fast-food
joints). But even as you are cheerfully being directed to any
of these sights, you get the feeling that the Glaswegian
hopes you won't be too impressed by his or her institutions,
and even less so by this year's planned 2,000 cultural
events, whose language -- publicity-speak -- and
international flavor (23 countries are contributing acts of
their own), may not say a lot about what is valued locally.
It was, however, with real, unrehearsed enthusiasm that I was
led by one self-appointed guide up a featureless residential
street to the house of Miss Agnes Toward. A typist for a
shipping firm for 45 years, Miss Toward lived with her mother
in a modest and tidy flat. She baked pies, listened to the
wireless, went to church, voted Conservative and saved
everything. When she died, the sparsely furnished rooms in
which she lived out her decent life were recognized as an
instant museum. There's not much to see in this diorama of
spinsterhood, but its very preservation suggests that what is
really being celebrated here is the ordinary citizen.
   Walking through the city, you will pass many buildings
wrapped in scaffolding. It is stirring to look up from the
street and, through the windows, see only sky. Glasgow may
think that it is preserving its facades while radically
remaking its innards; the opposite, however, would seem
truer.
