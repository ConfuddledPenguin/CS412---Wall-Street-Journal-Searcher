   Technology investors, take courage. You need it these
days, according to the top-performing technology mutual-fund
manager of the past year.
   "Every once in a while, the market gives you a chance to
be brave," says Roger B. McNamee, manager of the T. Rowe
Price Science &amp; Technology Fund. "This looks like a good
time."

   Of course, what he calls brave others may think foolhardy,
Mr. McNamee concedes. One technology stock after another has
plummeted in recent weeks because of disappointing earnings:
Oracle Systems plunged 31% on March 28. Legent sank 29.3% the
following week. Network Technologies has plummeted 69.6%
since the end of March. And one week ago, Digital Microwave
dived 49.5% in a spectacular, one-day free fall.
   But such "classic Maalox moments" can provide
opportunities as well, says Mr. McNamee, whose fund earned a
38.72% return for the year ended March 31. That compares to
the average return of 17.6% for the same period among 23
science and technology funds tracked by Lipper Analytical
Services.
   Mr. McNamee contends that, despite the recent earnings
shocks, technology companies as a group will become less
exciting but more profitable for investors. And he believes
that predictability will command a premium, particularly as
other industries limp through what he calls "an earnings
recession."
   That's not to say technology stocks will be shock-proof.
Companies developing new, unproven technology, often at
breakneck speed, will undoubtedly produce some flops and some
will "go ballistic" to success, he says.
   Mr. McNamee shuns the industry's "old leaders," such as
International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, in
favor of the "new leaders" -- Apple Computer, Microsoft, Sun
Microsystems, Oracle, Compaq, Chips &amp; Technologies and
Autodesk -- and the special-niche "incubators," such as
Integrated Systems and Electronic Arts.
   "I'm looking for companies who understand the world has
changed" during the seven-year bear market for technology,
says Mr. McNamee. The flood of venture capital that poured
into companies a decade ago is now a trickle. Demand for
personal computers has slowed to a crawl. Gone, he says, are
the days of 100% average annual revenue growth.
   "It's no longer appropriate for companies to sacrifice
{profit} margins to maximize revenue growth," he says. He
wants companies with big, secure market shares that can
deliver steady, reasonable rates of return.
   Earnings growth of 15% to 20% is reasonable, he says, even
for an industry accustomed to much higher rates. While
retailers, for instance, are struggling under huge debt
burdens, Mr. McNamee says his "new leaders" are secure in
their markets, have little debt and generate cash.
   "I'm not forecasting a bull market in technology," Mr.
McNamee cautions, "but I do think there's above-average
opportunity for investors."
   Among his stock picks:
   Sun Microsystems: Shares of the Mountain View, Calif.,
maker of high-performance desktop computers plunged last year
to 15 when it stumbled on a new product transition. Mr.
McNamee praises its transition in the past nine months from a
rapid grower of revenue with deteriorating profit margins to
a company that last week reported a gross profit margin of
48%, the highest in 18 months.
   Oracle Systems: "Its 25% to 30% growth rate will seem like
a vacation compared to what they were doing before," he says.
At 15 1/2 a share, the stock looks cheap in terms of the
$1.30 a share Mr. McNamee predicts the Belmont, Calif.,
marketer of database management will earn in fiscal 1991.
   Chips &amp; Technologies: "I'm being paid to wait," Mr.
McNamee says. The semiconductor maker's stock recently fell
to 16 from 22 after the company said earnings would be below
expectations. He thinks the company's franchise, cloning
microchips, is secure and the stock is inexpensive in view of
his fiscal 1991 earnings forecast of $2.21 a share.
   Autodesk: Earnings of the Sausalito, Calif., maker of
design and drafting software for architects and engineers
have been growing at about 50% a year. That rate will slow to
33% a year, Mr. McNamee says, but that's much better than
average. He estimates fiscal 1991 earnings of $2.50 a share.
   Integrated Systems: A recent initial public offering, this
company makes software largely for use in the auto industry,
such as in anti-lock braking systems and fuel-injection
systems. A "concept" stock with little history, Mr. McNamee
cautions that it's expensive at 40. But its product improves
auto makers' productivity and will be in demand, he predicts.
   Electronic Arts: The San Mateo, Calif., maker of games
used in personal computers should see revenue growth of about
30% a year, he says. It recently announced a licensing
agreement with Nintendo of America Inc.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The over-the-counter market slipped, as futures-related
program selling on the New York Stock Exchange set the tone.
The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.08 to 417.98, down 0.73%
for the day and 1.8% for the week.
   TPI Enterprises ended unchanged at 6 3/4 on more than 6.8
million shares after a 3.5 million-share block of the New
York-based restaurant and theater owners changed hands. Late
Thursday, Alltel Corp. sold the block, 16% of TPI's total
common shares outstanding, to S.G. Warburg Securities, which
placed it Friday with two dozen institutions.
   Telebit finished unchanged at 11 1/2 on more than 2.3
million shares. The Mountain View, Calif., computer modem
maker's initial public offering of 2,090,000 shares was
priced late Thursday at $10 each.
   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream rose 2 1/2 to 32 1/2 after the
Oakland, Calif., company reported net income for the first
quarter of 24 cents a share, up from 17 cents a share a year
earlier.
