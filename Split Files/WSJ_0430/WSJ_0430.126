   MILAN, Italy -- Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero
said the free flow of capital to and from Italy will help
force the Italian government to reduce the public-sector
deficit.
   Mr. Ruggiero signed a decree Friday to lift on May 14 all
of Italy's remaining foreign exchange restrictions, ahead of
the June 30 deadline of the European Community to abolish
barriers to crossborder capital flows.

   He likened Friday's move to Italy's decision in 1979 to
join the European Monetary System (EMS). "The entrance of our
currency in the EMS created the premise for winning the
battle against inflation and to give competitiveness to our
country that wasn't based on currency devaluations," he said
in a telephone interview from Rome.
   The measure will allow Italians to open foreign bank
accounts, hold foreign currency in domestic accounts and
borrow foreign currency from domestic banks. Mr. Ruggiero
said the foreign exchange liberalization will be followed by
measures to bring savings taxes in line with those of Italy's
European partners.
