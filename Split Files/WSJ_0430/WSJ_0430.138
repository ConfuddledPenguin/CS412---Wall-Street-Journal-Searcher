   As a native Philadelphian who regularly visits New York, I
can report only that Nicholas King's Leisure &amp; Arts article
of March 27 on Philadelphia is hogwash.
   Philadelphia is not a strange place to the sophisticated
New Yorker (and who else does the New York intelligentsia
write of?). To the contrary, New York is filled with native
Philadelphians and people who went to school there. The New
York Times has a regular Philadelphia-oriented column to meet
this interest; it does not deal only with crime and
corruption.

   Nor do Philadelphians ignore New York. Resent. Dislike.
But not ignore. Philadelphians with the means to travel know
New York too well. That is why we visit often and live in
Philadelphia.
   Finally, reading Mr. King's fanciful portrait of
Philadelphia as if it were some glistening, sparkling wonder
of a city makes me wonder if he has ever really seen its
"Downtown." Grungy, strewn with litter and homeless,
increasingly dangerous and increasingly shunned by
Philadelphians, the downtown areas reminds us of, well, New
York. It does not have a good reputation. True, our cabbies
are friendlier than yours, but that's easy to do and is not
saying much.
   I recommend that you have a Philadelphian write next time
rather than the director of the Foreign Press Center in New
York. Perhaps Mr. King can write about London or Paris,
presumably something he knows about.
