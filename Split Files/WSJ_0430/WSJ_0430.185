   Fixed-rate mortgages are approaching their highest levels
in more than a year, with additional increases expected in
coming weeks, said economists. The increase threatens to
throttle an already weak housing market.
   Interest rates on fixed loans have been climbing
incrementally all year, but in the past two weeks they have
surged about one-half percentage point because of a variety
of concerns, including inflation. The average weekly rate for
30-year fixed-rate loans purchased by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, increased to an indicated
11.03% Friday, including servicing fees. The rate is up from
an indicated 10.57% earlier this month, with many lenders
quoting fixed-rate loans at levels between 10.6% to 10.7%.

   The Freddie Mac rate is indicative of where rates are
expected to be in 30 days, but some lenders said fixed loans
could hit that mark as early as this week, approaching the
11.23% rate of 30-year fixed loans in February 1989.
   As a result, adjustable-rate mortgages, which have been
relatively stable, are expected to regain favor among
consumers. ARM rates, said HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.,
mortgage research concern, stood at a fully indexed rate of
10.50% Friday, down from 10.67% a month ago. But lenders
minimized the ARMs' ability to resuscitate an industry
already languishing from shrinking demand, affordability
problems and, now, higher rates.
   "The last two weeks have been very, very difficult," said
Walter C. Klein, Jr., chairman and president of Sears
Mortgage Corp., Riverwoods, Ill. The executive said Sears, a
unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., increased its mortgage rates
every day for the past 14 days, with the rates finally
reaching 10.5% Friday.
   Mr. Klein added that applications in April so far are off
15% from March and that loan volume this month will drop to
about $300 million, compared with $360 million in March. The
rate increase reduced loan applications nationwide 3% for the
week ending April 13, the most recent period available,
compared with a year earlier, according to the Mortgage
Bankers Association.
   "There's no question that loan volume has begun to slide,"
said Warren Lasko, the trade group's executive vice
president.
   Housing starts similarly are expected to come down,
following last week's interest-rate spurt. The National
Association of Home Builders' estimate of 1,350,000 starts
for 1990, already reduced once, is expected to fall to
1,300,000, trade group executives said. In addition to higher
interest rates, starts have been depressed by a plunge in
multifamily starts and a construction and development credit
crunch created by tighter thrift-lending rules.
   Although brokers across the country said it was too soon
to gauge the effect of higher rates on sales, existing home
sales remained flat in March, with 3,400,000 units sold on an
annualized basis, compared with February's 3,380,000 rate,
the lowest level in eight months. The National Association of
Realtors blamed the increased rates. New-home sales in
February, the last available month, grew 3.1% to 687,000 on
an annualized basis from 589,000 in January, but future
declines are likely.
   "I would expect {the interest-rate increase} to show up in
sales," said Michael S. Carliner, an economist with the
National Association of Home Builders.
   As dim as the industry's outlook is, ARMs are expected to
keep sales from dropping significantly, economists said.
Adjustables, on average, now are 2% points lower than
fixed-rate loans, the widest spread since March 1989. As a
result, economists said they expect ARMs to markedly improve
their current 25% market share in coming weeks.
