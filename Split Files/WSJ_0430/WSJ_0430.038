   Telebit said the stock is being offered through an
underwriting syndicate managed by Cowen &amp; Co. and Needham &amp;
Co. Telebit has granted the underwriters an option to
purchase up to an additional 313,500 shares of common stock
to cover any over-allotments.
   The company said it plans to use proceeds from the
offering for capital expenditures and for general corporate
purposes. It added that some of the proceeds may also be used
to fund acquisitions of data-communications businesses,
products or technologies, although no such acquisitions are
currently identified.
