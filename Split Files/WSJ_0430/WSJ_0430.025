   PARIS -- The Paris Club of creditor governments said
members agreed to reschedule payments of debt owed to them by
Jamaica, but under its policy, didn't disclose the sum.
   The group said the rescheduled payments will be made over
10 years, with a five-year grace period. The Paris Club said
Canada, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Norway, Britain and the U.S. participated in the
negotiations. Belgium, Finland, Spain and Sweden sent
observers. The debt relief move follows a March 23 standby
arrangement with the International Monetary Fund.
