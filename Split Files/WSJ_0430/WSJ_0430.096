   TOKYO -- At age 70, Kiichi Miyazawa is a walking, talking
history book. He became secretary to Japan's finance minister
in 1942, not long after the infamous and ill-advised attack
on Pearl Harbor. After the war he entered politics and rose
to the high councils of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP). In the 1960s, he headed economic planning and
represented Japan in the highly meritorious Kennedy Round
trade negotiations.
   In 1970, he took charge of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI), the vaunted centerpiece of Japan
Inc. He became minister of foreign affairs in 1974 and in the
late 1980s he was minister of finance, second only to prime
minister as Japan's most important post.

   He, along with other high LDP officials, later were swept
out after revelations of high-level influence buying by
Recruit Cosmos, a large employment agency. But he remains one
of the LDP's most influential figures, and probably one of
the wisest. After all, he has been on the scene through
nearly 50 years of Japan's evolution from cruel and arrogant
militarism to postwar destitution to constitutional democracy
to industrial restoration, and ultimately to today's role as
a major industrial power.
   Now, Japan is entering a new stage, and the transition
will have importance for a larger world that has come to
depend heavily on Japanese production and capital. Holding
court for a group of American editors in his small,
unpretentious LDP office, the engaging and diminutive Mr.
Miyazawa defines the transition. The LDP is responding to its
sagging popularity with Japanese voters, he says, "through
more attention to the consumer sector."
   What policy measures does that entail? He says that the
Japanese bureaucracy will deal with that. It has focused on
promoting production and exports. Now it will bend its
efforts to opening ways for the Japanese people to enjoy the
fruits of their hard work.
   Indeed, the redirection began some time ago and was only
intensified by the LDP's loss of the upper house of the
Japanese Parliament last July. One reason Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu was able to establish rapport with George Bush
and the U.S.-Japan "structural impediments" negotiations
turned out well is that the LDP has had very strong signals
from Japanese voters that they too want the system opened up
to more competition, more access to foreign products and, as
a consequence, living standards that would begin to rise
toward those American workers enjoy. The LDP's policy has
been reflected in a substantial rise in imports and a smaller
trade surplus.
   As this transition occurs, there is every possibility that
Japan will have a very different economy from the one that
has generated such pride among narrowly focused Japanese
mercantilists and fear among their mercantilist brethren in
Europe and America. Instead of producing huge surpluses of
Sonys and Toyotas for the world to buy and enjoy, the
Japanese are bent on employing more of their productive
resources toward meeting their own needs.
   If that happens, and if it results in a permanent decline
in Japan's trade surpluses, Japan will become a less
significant exporter of capital to other parts of the world,
and particularly to the U.S. Since the Japanese have been
financing some 30% of the U.S. budget deficit through their
use of their surplus dollars to buy Treasury bonds and notes,
and since they also are important buyers of other financial
and real assets in the U.S. and Europe, a decline in Japanese
capital exports can have world-wide importance.
   In the postwar era, the world has had three major cycles
of capital exportation. In the 1950s, a resurgent U.S.
economy generated capital to pour into rebuilding the
war-ravaged industries of Europe and Japan. Much of that
capital was private, invested with great efficiency by
rapidly expanding U.S. "multinationals." That process gained
a full head of steam in the 1960s, but late in that decade it
was stalled by U.S. government budgetary and monetary
excesses.
   Those same excesses carried over into the 1970s, when
attempts to mask them with price controls exploded into an
"oil shock." Then the OPEC nations became the big capital
exporters. Much of that surplus was squandered on
ill-considered developing-world investments, generating the
"debt crisis." With the U.S. industrial machine stalled as
well, world economic progress slowed dangerously.
   In the 1980s, thanks in large part to reforms in U.S.
economic policy, the world economy came back to life. This
time it was Japan's turn to become the big capital exporter.
Although some of that capital was used to finance big budget
deficits in the U.S. and Europe, much of it was used
efficiently by the Japanese to build productive facilities in
the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.
   So what about the future efficiency of capital generation
and recycling? On the margin, Japan's transition could make a
difference. The Japanese population is aging, which means
that Japan will spend more of its surpluses on merely
maintaining the incomes of people who are no longer
productive. It most likely will spend more for public works.
While such investments have a return, public money usually is
spent with less efficiency than private investment, even in
Japan. Japan will simply consume more and save less.
   Where are there other good prospects for capital
surpluses? Western Europe could become more effective at
generating surpluses as European Community barriers fall.
Capital investments in Eastern Europe also could begin to
have large yields if genuine market systems come into being.
That is mainly because those economies have so much room for
improvement.
   But those two huge, sick giants, China and Russia, at this
point show very little prospect of being anything other than
a drag on the world economy. As to the U.S., Congress seems
once again bent on killing off economic vigor with new
burdens -- the Clean Air Act, for example -- that have
dubious cost-benefit yields.
   This is all beginning to sound like a doom-and-gloom
scenario, but it need not be. Resources are only finite if
productivity remains frozen. Japan already is trying to
offset its labor-shortage problem with huge investments in
automation. U.S. industry has made major investments of that
type, too. European industry surely will do so as economies
of scale become more achievable through market expansion.
   Indeed, a world less dependent on a single huge recycler
of capital could be a healthier world economically. It might
be a world in which lenders will exercise more caution in
their investments, applying some discipline to borrowers that
have profligate tendencies. Finally, the economy Mr. Miyazawa
helped build has a lot of life in it yet. That is no bad
thing for the world at large.
