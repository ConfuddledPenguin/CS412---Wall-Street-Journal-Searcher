   Computer Associates International Inc. will unveil today a
strategy designed to bring some order to the collection of
software products it has accumulated in its acquisition binge
in recent years.
   Customers and consultants said the announcement should
address some of the concerns that customers and investors
have developed about Computer Associates in the past year.

   Computer Associates, the largest independent software
company, had been growing nearly 50% annually in the past
several years and generates more than $1 billion of revenue a
year, but it stumbled badly in the summer. The acquisition of
Cullinet Software Inc. took much longer to work through than
expected. Sales stalled while customers waited to see how
Computer Associates would handle the overlap in the two
companies' product lines.
   Those problems then brought to a head existing concerns
about Computer Associates; Gartner Group Inc., a
market-research firm, says the Garden City, N.Y., company
ranks at or near the bottom of its user-satisfaction surveys.
   Investors quickly got nervous, too, and have stayed that
way. Some analysts already were saying they believed the
company was using aggressive accounting procedures during its
numerous acquisitions to make results look far better than
they were. So, at the first sign of weakness, the stock
tumbled 50%. It closed Friday at $13 a share, down 12.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, still
some 40% below its 52-week high.
   In an attempt to get some momentum going again, Computer
Associates executives said they will, in effect, promise to
cross-pollinate their numerous products. The best-known of
those are mainframe and minicomputer products that make
computer systems run more efficiently. The company also sells
data bases and packages aimed at specific markets, such as
banking.
   The Computer Associates executives said features in
products for International Business Machines Corp. hardware
will be made available on Digital Equipment Corp. machines,
and vice versa. The ability to grab data from relatively new
"relational" data bases will be provided in older systems,
known as hierarchical or navigational data bases. Software
that generates reports from a banking package may be made
available on other products.
   The strategy plays into the major concern that corporate
customers have these days: Now that they've spent millions of
dollars on all this hardware and software, how are they
supposed to get it all to talk to each other? The strategy
should also reassure customers that Computer Associates
doesn't plan a wholesale abandonment of many of the products
it has acquired.
   Still, the announcement doesn't include a timetable, and
such broad efforts usually take several years to implement.
They also almost always prove to be tougher to develop than
expected.
