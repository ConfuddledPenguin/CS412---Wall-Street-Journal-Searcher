   NEW YORK -- George Soros and Michael Steinhardt conjure up
an image of smart money. These money managers run so-called
"hedge funds" that take sizable risks, are closed to small
investors and institutions and available only to the very
wealthy.
   Their funds use leverage-borrowing to magnify profits, a
technique that can also amplify losses. They sell short,
betting on stock prices falling. And sometimes the fund
manager bets the ranch, putting the entire fund into one or
two positions.

   Normally, the track records of these funds are available
by invitation only. But a rare peek at their performance
shows what those big risks are all about. While the best of
them sometimes shoot the lights out, as George Soros did in
more than doubling his investors' money in 1985, sometimes
they stumble badly, as Asher Edelman did when one of his
funds tumbled 33.6% last year.
   The rare peek is provided by a new booklet, "The U.S.
Offshore Funds Directory," by Antoine Bernheim. It lists
vital statistics of about 78 funds incorporated in tax havens
from Bermuda to Panama and managed for non-U.S. investors who
aren't subject to U.S. capital-gains taxes or investment
regulations.
   Mr. Bernheim, a 36-year-old New York consultant to
European investors, says he obtained most of the numbers
merely by asking for them. One reason it was so easy: Mr.
Bernheim represents Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian financier
and chairman of Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co., a major European
computer and electronics concern.
   None of the fund managers contacted for this story
disputed the accuracy of the figures, most of which are
calculated after subtracting managers' fees, typically 1%
annually plus a hefty 20% of profits. Mr. Bernheim plans to
charge $295 for the directory.
   Of all the directory's statistics, none is more
eye-catching than the 1985 performance of Quantum Fund N.V.,
managed by Mr. Soros. It delivered a total return including
dividends of 122.2%, while the stock market as a whole,
measured by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.'s 500-stock index,
returned 31.6% that year.
   The next two years weren't shabby, either, for a fund that
has grown to $2.2 billion in assets at the end of 1989. In
1986, Quantum returned 42.1%, against 18.6% for the S&amp;P 500;
in 1987, its return was 14.1%, against 5.1% for the S&amp;P 500.
   Stan Druckenmiller, a managing director of Soros Fund
Management, explains that Mr. Soros outperformed the market
in that period mainly with a big bet that the Japanese yen
would rise and the U.S. dollar would fall. It was a trend
that gained momentum in the fall of 1985 after finance
ministers of the major Western industrial powers agreed to
make that their policy in order to correct world trade
imbalances.
   Mr. Soros also gained from betting that oil prices would
decline in 1986 and by investing in cyclical industrial
stocks in 1986 and 1987. Although he sustained estimated
losses of $700 million during the October 1987 stock market
crash, he still finished the year far ahead of the overall
market.
   However, even investment gurus falter occasionally. In
1988, Quantum was behind the market with a return of 10.1%,
vs. 16.6% for the S&amp;P 500. And in 1989, Quantum merely
matched the S&amp;P's gain of 31.7%. The fund took a hit when the
dollar bounced back against the yen, and when Japanese stocks
defied logic and rose instead of collapsing -- until they
finally slumped this year.
   Quantum would have lagged behind the U.S. market by being
too cautious last year, Mr. Druckenmiller explains, if it
hadn't hit home runs with investments in Thailand, where the
stock market doubled, and in Europe, where the German stock
market soared when the Berlin Wall fell.
   The situation was just the reverse at Jaguar Fund N.V., a
hedge fund run by Julian Robertson that returned 49.5% last
year and topped the market by 10 percentage points in 1988.
That followed two years of badly lagging behind the market in
1986 and 1987.
   Mr. Robertson said he was helped in 1989 by selling a big
position in United Airlines's parent UAL Corp. -- which had
nearly tripled during a takeover attempt -- before the stock
collapsed when the deal failed. But in 1986 and 1987, he
said, he was hurt by an oil-stock hedge that misfired, by
being in value stocks instead of earnings-momentum stocks,
and by betting prematurely on a drop in Japanese stocks.
   Although the past two years have helped Jaguar overtake
the market, Mr. Robertson says, "It shows how difficult it is
for a hedge fund to come back from a rocky start. If you lose
50%, you have to make up 100% just to get back even."
   Performance also has been uneven at two of the funds in
the directory that go beyond passive investments in markets
or stocks and actually try to influence the outcome of
corporate events. Called "strategic block investing" by the
directory, these funds try to buy enough stock to put
pressure on a particular company to restructure, either
through a takeover or recapitalization.
   Coniston Partners has enjoyed considerable success with
this method of investing by forcing restructurings at such
companies as Allegis Corp., the predecessor to UAL, Viacom
International and TW Services Corp. During the heyday of
corporate raiders, Coniston acted like a raider to produce
spectacular returns of 69.3% in 1985, 36.7% in 1986, 15% in
1987 and 38.2% in 1988.
   However, Coniston's returns faltered last year, when the
weather turned stormy for corporate raiders. While still
posting a 14% return, Coniston's offshore fund lagged the
market by more than 17 percentage points. And Coniston faces
a potentially difficult 1990 as well because it is losing
money on its $400 million stake in UAL, and future profits in
that stock depend at the moment on a union group obtaining
financing for an acquisition. Coniston wouldn't comment.
   Asher Edelman, a takeover stock trader who became a
corporate raider in the mid-1980s, hasn't matched Coniston's
success with a similar fund he formed in 1988. Although the
fund outperformed the market by 10 percentage points that
year, it lost 33.6% in value last year, apparently hurt by
Mr. Edelman's setbacks at Datapoint Corp. and particularly in
Storehouse PLC, where an attempted raid was quashed by
British takeover rules. A spokeswoman for Mr. Edelman
declined to comment.
   Another hedge-fund manager, Cumberland Associates, led by
a team including Oscar Schafer and Richard Reiss Jr., enjoys
a reputation as an excellent stockpicker using fundamental
values. But results of its overseas Cumber International N.V.
have lagged behind for the market for three of the last five
years. Its executives couldn't be reached for comment.
   As an investor with one of the shortest-term orientations
on Wall Street, Michael Steinhardt focuses on the present --
so much so that he can't remember the reasons his S.P.
International S.A. outperformed the market in 1985 and 1986.
   Mr. Steinhardt says that although managers are measured,
and get paid, based on their year-to-year performance, he
thinks a long-term perspective is more relevant. Although he
lagged the market by seven percentage points in 1989, he
outperformed it by 18 percentage points in 1988.
   After successfully pursuing post-crash bargains in 1988,
Mr. Steinhardt says he was too cautious about the market in
1989 because of "the level of anxiety about the likelihood of
a recession, and the demise of various financial institutions
such as savings and loans, junk bonds and leveraged
buy-outs."
   He also stumbled in 1989 by acquiring 9% of USAir Group
Inc., which despite his best efforts wasn't borne aloft by
takeover fever like other airlines. In that case, Mr.
Steinhardt concedes, "ego got in the way of logic."
