   AIDS IN CUBA

   Three-quarters of Cuba's sexually active population has
been tested for AIDS, the official Communist Party newspaper
Granma said.
   The tests revealed 434 carriers of the AIDS virus to date,
of which 63 had developed the disease and 27 died from it. Of
those who tested positive, 315 were men and 119 were women.
Their average age was 26, the youngest a girl of 15 and the
oldest a man of 57.
   The Cuban government says it has managed to control the
spread of the disease on the island by means of massive
testing and obligatory segregation of AIDS patients in a
special clinic. Patients can work and receive a salary while
being treated at the clinic.
   The importation of blood products has been banned in Cuba
since 1983.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA'S `FX' PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will spend $77 million on developing a
facsimile machine to compete with similar products in Japan
and other countries. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency,
said the "FX" project was approved by government officials
because Japan and other nations were reluctant to transfer
their advanced technology. Yonhap said South Korea wants to
begin exports of the machine in 1995.
                                                                                                       

   DRASTIC MEASURES IN GREECE
                                                                                                       

   The newly elected Greek government announced drastic price
rises and higher indirect taxes. The measures are intended to
increase state income by 400 billion drachmas ($2.43 billion)
this year but will increase the annual inflation rate by 4
percentage points, Economy Minister George Souflias said;
last year's rate was 15%. Said Mr. Souflias: "Of every 100
drachmas the state spends it has to borrow 40. This has to
come to an end."
                                                                                                       

   NEW ZEALAND EMIGRATION
                                                                                                       

   New Zealand's net population loss through emigration has
slowed sharply, the Department of Statistics said. The
department said that in the 12 months ended March 31, net
loss through migration movements fell 83.6% to 4,040 persons,
down from a net loss of 24,708 persons in the 12 months ended
March 31, 1989. The net loss in the 12 months to March was
the smallest net loss in six years. New Zealand last recorded
a net gain in population through migration in the 12 months
ended March 31, 1984. At the last census, in 1986, New
Zealand's population totaled 3.3 million people.
                                                                                                       

   NORWEGIAN TV PROPOSAL
                                                                                                       

   Norway's government proposed opening national airwaves to
private television broadcasts and lifting an almost-total ban
on TV commercials. The proposal to parliament calls for the
creation of a second channel, funded by up to 30 minutes a
day of advertising. The one existing channel, financed by
viewer licenses and state transfers, has had a near monopoly
on radio and TV broadcasts since it was founded in 1933.
                                                                                                       

   A NO-TAX PLEDGE IN GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   Helmut Seiters, the chief of staff of the West German
government, said the German economic and monetary union will
be financed with the help of strong economic growth, a rise
in the budget deficit and spending cuts -- but without any
tax increases. Speaking in the West German parliament, he
said: "Tax increases aren't necessary." The strong rise in
gross national product, which is expected to climb 4% this
year, should boost tax revenue by 30 billion marks (about $18
billion) in 1990 and 1991, Mr. Seiters said.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA CHANGES COURSE
                                                                                                       

   China has dropped its earlier opposition to Hong Kong's
plan for a multibillion dollar port and airport complex,
Chinese officials said.
   The Hong Kong-based officials said the economic-research
units of China's state-owned companies in the British colony
were examining the project to see if China could take part.
Experts from the New China News Agency, the de facto Chinese
embassy in Hong Kong, and the Bank of China group, China's
major financial arm, are monitoring and analyzing the plan,
they said.
   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, unveiled plans
last year for a $16.28 billion complex, including a new
international airport, a high-speed rail link, a six-lane
highway and a new port. The project, to be financed by the
government and the private sector, is seen as demonstrating
confidence that Hong Kong will remain a vibrant international
center after China regains sovereignty in 1997.
   Chinese officials have said they oppose using Hong Kong's
cash reserves for the airport, saying the money was intended
for territorial government after 1997. A Bank of China
official said: "Basically we have no objection to the plans
because it eventually serves Hong Kong. But we must ensure it
will not become a burden to us when the British are gone."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Playwright Eugene Ionesco said the return of ex-King
Michael was the only way of ending unrest in Romania. "Only a
king could halt the debacle in poor Romania," the
Romanian-born dramatist, now a resident of France, wrote in
Paris's Le Figaro. . . . A Chernobyl telethon run by Soviet
TV last week raised millions of rubles and dollars for
children who suffered from the world's worst nuclear
disaster, Tass reported. Contributions reportedly ranged from
$500,000 from a family company in Australia to dozens of
dollars donated by individuals.
