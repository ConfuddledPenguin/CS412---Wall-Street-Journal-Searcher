   NEW YORK -- In a victory for Avon Products Inc.'s largest
shareholder, a federal judge invalidated a key amendment to
the company's "poison pill" provision.
   Separately, Avon said the sale of its 60% stake in Avon
Japan to Friends of Freesia Co. and its president, Veji
Sasaki, for $450 million has been officially terminated. At
an analysts' meeting last week, Avon's chairman and chief
executive officer, James Preston, said that Avon will
aggressively seek a new buyer for the line.

   In a decision Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Pierre
Leval entered an order against Avon's attempt to lower the
threshold at which its shareholder rights plan goes into
effect. The rights are attached to each share of common and
allow shareholders to acquire Avon stock at half price if any
buyer acquires a 20% holding.
   Avon had sought to reduce that percentage to 12.5% to
prevent Chartwell Associates Limited Partnership, the
company's largest shareholder, from acquiring more stock
without tendering for the company. Chartwell, which had
challenged the proposed amendment, currently controls 12.4%
of Avon. Unless the judge's ruling is overturned, Chartwell
will be able to buy another 7.5% of Avon common at market
prices rather than paying the premium that accompanies a
tender.
   Chartwell consists of oil heir Gordon Getty, Mary Kay
Corp. Vice Chairman John Rochon and the Fisher real estate
family of New York.
   An Avon spokesman said Friday that Avon will appeal Judge
Leval's decision. A Chartwell spokesman declined to comment
on whether the partnership will buy additional Avon shares.
Chartwell and Avon avoided an expensive proxy fight earlier
this year when Avon agreed to support two Chartwell
candidates to Avon's board. But relations between management
and Chartwell remain frosty.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Avon
shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $35.50.
   Wall Street analysts said the judge's decision will
probably spur additional interest in Avon shares.
   "Avon has resisted Chartwell at every turn, and this is
one more hurdle that has been knocked down," said Alice Beebe
Longley, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. "This will enable Chartwell to get up near
20% and then tender for the rest. Chartwell's plans continue
to bolster Avon's stock."
   Ms. Longley said that she considered it likely that
Chartwell will now attempt to buy more shares, either in
large blocks or on the open market.
   Andrew Shore, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., described Judge Leval's order as "a significant
development," and indicated he also expects Chartwell to
continue buying Avon shares until it reaches the 20% level.
