   Regarding your April 5 page-one story on school dress
codes:
   If you tell those inner-city kids that when they play for
the New York Yankees they will have to wear a uniform, maybe
they can understand a dress code in high school isn't so bad.
If you also tell them that when they become executives at
General Motors they will have to wear a uniform, maybe
they'll get the picture.
