   In your March 23 Heard on the Street ("Real Estate Woes
May Hurt Big Insurers"), you quote selectively from a report
by Fox-Pitt Kelton, identifying mortgage exposure as an
investment concern. The report found that "the level of
troubled mortgages was actually down vs. year-end 1988,"
although many commercial banks and savings and loans had
significant increases in their troubled mortgages during the
year.
   The report also said: "We do not view the {Lincoln
National} mortgage portfolio or its potential for
deterioration from its present condition as an investment
risk of any significance."
