   NEW LONDON, Conn. -- NESB Corp., a banking concern, said
it signed a letter of intent with its insurance company
lenders on a plan to correct its default of covenants in a
$50 million loan agreement.
   The plan, which needs approval by the NESB board and bank
regulators, consists of early payments of interest and the
pledging of certain bank assets to the insurance companies.

   The company has said its first-quarter loss put it in
default of covenants of a $50 million long-term debt
agreement with a group of insurance companies. The money was
used to finance NESB's $48 million acquisition of OmniBank.
In February, OmniBank was merged with New England Savings
Banks, NESB's only subsidiary.
