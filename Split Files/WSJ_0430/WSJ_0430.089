   COLUMBIA, Md. -- Ryland Group Inc. considers an analyst's
estimate of 1990 per-share earnings of $3.25 to $3.50 to be
"reasonable" despite slower housing-market conditions in some
parts of the country, Charles E. Peck, chairman and chief
executive officer, said in an interview.
   For 1989, the home builder reported earnings of $58
million, or $3.25 a share, on revenue of $1.4 billion. On
Thursday, Ryland reported a 39% increase in first-quarter
profit, to $6.5 million, or 46 cents a share, from $4.6
million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.

   Mr. Peck attributed the recent improvement to a record
number of homes delivered during the first quarter, a 12%
increase from a year earlier. Unusually warm weather during
the first quarter and strong sales in the third and fourth
quarters last year contributed to the large number of
deliverable homes.
   But the number of new homes sold by Ryland decreased 12%
from 1989's first quarter. Moreover, some industry observers
are concerned that rising mortgage interest rates will damp
demand for new homes. Lawrence J. Horan, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Research, said he thinks declining order
trends "will come home to hurt earnings." Mr. Horan predicted
that Ryland's earnings will erode in 1990 to the range of
$2.25 to $2.35 a share.
   Mr. Peck dismissed such pessimism as "very dark." He said
Ryland feels "good about first-quarter earnings at the same
time we recognize uncertainty for the rest of the year." He
also conceded that declining orders would affect earnings "if
the trend were to go on forever."
   Ryland's profit margin rose to 3.7% of sales in 1990's
first quarter, compared with 2.2% a year earlier. Mr. Peck
said the margin will be under pressure as the company moves
more aggressively into Southern markets. "We are seeing a
shift of new business toward Texas and Florida, where the
homes are small and so are the profits," he said.
   Noting that home building is a very local business, Mr.
Peck said market conditions vary widely. In some markets,
such as California, demand seems to be increasing, he said.
"Traffic at our model homes shows that lots of people are
interested in buying new homes." In Houston, for example,
"demand is exceeding supply," Mr. Peck said.
   Ryland doesn't plan any acquisitions during 1990. "Because
the market is so big, we don't need to acquire businesses,"
said Mr. Peck. "We expect growth from increased business and
an expanding market share." He said the company is already
expanding into Wilmington, Del., and from Sacramento to San
Francisco.
