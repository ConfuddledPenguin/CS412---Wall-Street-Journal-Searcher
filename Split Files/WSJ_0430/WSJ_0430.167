   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Xerox Corp., in an unusual approach to
cutting costs, essentially asked its key suppliers to refund
3% of the amount they billed the company during 1989.
   Xerox also asked the suppliers to cut their prices 10% by
1991.

   The requests, which Xerox said were unrelated to its
record $254 million first-quarter loss, came as part of the
company's continuing effort to boost efficiency in its
business-equipment operation. Total costs and expenses in
that operation rose 3% in the first quarter from the year
before.
   A Xerox spokesman said suppliers who don't comply won't
necessarily face any consequences. "It isn't a demand," he
said. "It's a request, a suggestion. Should a supplier
decline to agree with that suggestion, that wouldn't be a
determining factor in our relationship."
   Xerox said it asked 350 suppliers world-wide -- mostly
producers of parts for Xerox's business machines -- to reduce
their 1990 billings by an amount equivalent to 3% of their
1989 billings. The spokesman said he had no estimate of the
saving Xerox expects from the move, of which it notified
suppliers about three weeks ago.
