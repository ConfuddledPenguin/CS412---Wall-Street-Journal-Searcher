   Next week could be a great time to buy Treasury
securities.
   That's when the government will hold its quarterly
refunding, a multibillion-dollar sale of Treasury notes and
bonds to refinance Uncle Sam's maturing debt and help pay the
bills piling up from the federal budget deficit.

   With yields on most government securities now above 9%,
income-oriented investors have strong incentive to put some
of their money in super-safe Treasurys. The quarterly
refunding gives individuals a chance to buy directly from the
government, without paying any brokerage fees or commissions.
   "I think this is a great opportunity," says Kathleen B.
Cooper, executive vice president at Security Pacific National
Bank in Los Angeles.
   Treasury yields are currently half a percentage point to a
full percentage point higher than yields on alternative
investments like certificates of deposit. Treasurys even look
good compared with far-riskier stock market investments: The
average annual return on stocks over the past six decades was
only one percentage point higher, at 10%.
   And income from Treasurys is exempt from state and local
taxes -- an important advantage for investors in high-tax
states, such as California, Massachusetts and New York.
   Some bond market professionals say yields may rise another
quarter of a point or so this spring, partly because of the
sheer enormity of the government's borrowing needs. Many are
also concerned about recent bad news about inflation --
including Friday's report on the nation's first-quarter
economic performance, showing one measure of inflation
running at a sizzling 6.5% annual rate.
   Further signs of increasing inflation could persuade the
Federal Reserve to drive rates higher. Indeed, economists at
Salomon Brothers Inc. called for the Fed to take "prompt
action" to battle inflation.
   But while this may not be the year's absolute peak in
Treasury yields, it could be the opening of a window of
opportunity for individual investors. Some market analysts
say the latest economic figures exaggerate the inflation
problem and that price pressures will ease later this year,
pulling down interest rates.
   This view is shared by some of the nation's most
influential money managers. "We're definitely leaning in the
direction of buying significant amounts" of the new notes and
bonds the Treasury will sell in May, says William H. Gross,
managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co., a
Newport Beach, Calif.-based firm that manages more than $26
billion.
   Ms. Cooper of Security Pacific says "real," or
inflation-adjusted, yields on long-term Treasury bonds are
currently about 4 1/2%. That compares with just over 2% over
the past 40 years, she says. "I have a lot of difficulty
believing long-term Treasurys will be above 9% at the end of
this year," says Ms. Cooper.
   Investors don't have to lock up their money for long
periods of time to get the current 9% returns. Even
short-term and intermediate-term Treasury notes now yield 9%.
   May's big Treasury sale is expected to consist of more
than $30 billion of threeyear and 10-year notes and 30-year
bonds. The details are to be announced Wednesday afternoon.
   While Treasury securities can be purchased for a fee
through most banks and brokerage houses, investors can also
buy them directly from the government at sales like the
coming refunding without paying a service charge.
   Investors who want to do so should contact the nearest
office of the Federal Reserve and ask for information on the
"Treasury Direct" system. Three-year Treasury notes are sold
in multiples of $5,000, while longer-term Treasurys require
investors to put up as little as $1,000.
   Treasury securities are especially attractive to
individual investors. Not only are they fully backed by the
U.S. government, they are also easy to unload in a hurry
because of the enormous size of the government bond market.
The Treasury market is the world's largest securities arena,
with average daily trading volume of more than $100 billion.
   Keeping track of Treasury investments is also easy. A
complete list of Treasury note and bond prices in the
"secondary," or resale, market is published daily in this and
many other newspapers. Much less daily information is
available to ordinary investors on other types of bonds,
including tax-exempt municipal securities.
   Moreover, investors in Treasury securities don't have to
worry about another problem that plagues many municipal and
corporate bond holders: early "calls." Most municipal and
corporate bonds can be "called," or redeemed, by the issuer
well before the scheduled maturity date. Issuers take
advantage of this when interest rates drop by selling new
bonds at lower rates and using proceeds to redeem older
bonds. That is great for issuers but bad news for investors
who thought they were guaranteed a steady stream of interest
payments for long periods of time. All new Treasury notes and
bonds can't be redeemed prior to their stated maturity dates.
   Of course, Treasurys shouldn't be the only thing in an
investor's portfolio. Prudent diversification calls for
investors to have some of their money in stocks to help
combat the effects of inflation over time.
   Still, Treasurys can be an important part of a diversified
portfolio. And despite the latest bout of inflation worry,
analysts say this could be a good time to buy some.
   "I like bonds here," says Robert Barbera, executive vice
president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Even though
first-quarter inflation numbers looked "horrible," he expects
lower inflation over the next 12 months.
   Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan
Bank, is also looking for inflation to fall back. "It's very
hard to be optimistic in such a pessimistic environment, but
I don't have a sense inflation is as bad the numbers recently
have suggested," he says. "I think inflation has been
overstated in the last few months."
   Samuel D. Kahan, senior vice president and chief economist
at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, says that while the fight
against inflation will continue, "I think these yields now
are attractive."
   One of the big unknowns about the May Treasury sale is the
extent to which Japanese investors will participate. Japanese
institutions usually buy large amounts of Treasury debt at
quarterly auctions. But this time around, many Japanese
institutions may buy less than they customarily do because
numerous Japanese firms have been hurt badly by plummeting
Tokyo stock prices.
   Japanese bond prices also have fallen, driving yields
sharply higher. That has greatly reduced the gap between
Japanese and U.S. bond issues and thus increased the relative
attractiveness of Japanese issues. As of late Friday,
Japanese government bonds due in about 10 years yielded
7.40%, only about 1.6 percentage points below comparable U.S.
issues. That is an unusually narrow spread and may further
discourage Japanese investors from buying American.
   If the Japanese were to stay away from the May refunding,
the Treasury might be forced to pay even higher yields to
lure investors.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices swung widely, ending with small
gains.
   Early in the day, the government's first-quarter economic
report dominated the markets, whipsawing prices. Government
bond prices were bolstered later by rumors of strong buying
of intermediateterm securities by Middle Eastern investors.
   The government's benchmark 30-year bonds ended the day
with a gain of about 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face
amount. The issue's price rose to 94 17/32, while its yield
fell slightly to 9.02% from 9.03%.
   The inflation news "looked very bad," said Allen Sinai,
executive vice president at Boston Co. "These rates are far
above what the Federal Reserve wants." He expects the Fed to
tighten credit, although not right away. He also expects
Treasury bond yields to rise further, with the long-term bond
hovering between about 9% and 9 1/4%. "Rising inflation is
the worst thing for the bond market," he said. "Not until the
inflation fires get put out does the risk of higher rates go
away."
   In the corporate market, robust demand from investors
prompted underwriters to increase the size of an already huge
bond issue of Chrysler Corp. The $1 billion issue of
guaranteed exchangeable certificates, priced Thursday, was
boosted to $1.1 billion. The certificates will actually be
issued by Auburn Hills Trust, which will hold the title to
the Chrysler Technology Center and lease the facilities back
to Chrysler.
   In the corporate junk bond market, prices ended 1/4 to 1/2
point lower. High-yield bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Funding and
related entities suffered even bigger losses after news that
casino and real estate king Donald Trump is considering
selling the Trump Shuttle and other major assets. For
example, the 14% issue of Trump Taj Mahal Funding bonds were
offered two points lower at 76 1/4.
   Prices of actively traded tax-exempt municipal bonds ended
lower, driving up yields. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds of 2018 were quoted late in the day at a yield of
7.62%, up from 7.60% Thursday.

Federal Reserve through the Treasury Direct System, or
