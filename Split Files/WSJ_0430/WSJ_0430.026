   TORONTO -- Loblaw Companies Ltd., Canada's largest food
distributor, expects that its 1990 per-share earnings will be
about 20% ahead of last year's profits.
   Richard Currie, president, said after the annual meeting
that earnings growth for the year likely would match the rate
set in the latest first quarter. Loblaw reported a
first-quarter net income of 16 million Canadian dollars
(US$13.8 million) or 17 cents a share, compared with C$12.3
million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Last year, Loblaw had annual net income of C$70 million, or
80 cents a share, on sales of C$7.9 billion.

   Loblaw's higher earnings this year largely will be the
result of lower interest costs and depreciation and higher
operating profits. Mr. Currie said Loblaw has completed its
investment and acquisition program, which began in 1984, so
capital expenditures in 1990 will be about 165 million
Canadian dollars (US$142.2 million), roughly the same amount
spent last year on fixed asset additions. He said the company
doesn't plan to make any big acquisitions in Canada or the
U.S.
   Mr. Currie said sales of Loblaw's "Green" line of
environmental products, which includes phosphate-free laundry
detergent and sugarless, low-salt and low-fat processed
foods, should increase to about C$100 million this year, from
about C$60 million last year. He said the number of Green
products will grow to 150 this year, from 100 last year; and
the product line will be profitable if it achieves the
forecast sales level. Loblaw is test-marketing its Green
products in some U.S. cities, including New York, Dallas and
Detroit.
