   The boss's fair-haired boy
   Doesn't get there overnight;
   It takes considerable work,
   With things done exactly right.
   One must be on constant call,
   Showing diligence and flair,
   And in time the fair-haired boy
   Will most likely have gray hair.

   Robbery Report
                                                                                                       

   I just got out of the hospital, and I have one question:
Why do the nurses wear masks when it's the cashier who
should?
