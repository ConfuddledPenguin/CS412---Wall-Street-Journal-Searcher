   The pingpong business is starting to bounce. And
entrepreneurs are finding more than one way to capitalize on
a sport that's on the rise.
   Long in the shadow of tennis, pingpong (also called table
tennis) became an Olympic sport two years ago. Now the
suppliers of tables, paddles and other pingpong equipment --
small businesses all -- are finding that the Olympic stature
is enhancing their sales.

   Peter Bjurman, the president of Table Tennis America Ltd.,
an equipment distributor in Oklahoma City, Okla., says the
company's sales are rising 20% a year, compared with the 5%
rate before the 110-year-old sport went Olympic.
   "Demand for tournament-type equipment has increased so
much that we're even planning to build our own production
site in the U.S. soon," Mr. Bjurman says. The company has
been importing tables and paddles made by its Swedish parent,
Stiga AB.
   To get the pingpong millions, entrepreneurs are playing
many angles. For instance, some entrepreneurs say the Olympic
status for pingpong has created opportunities to sell fans
ever more advanced -- and costlier -- products.
   "There's been a real boost in the average family's
consciousness about the sport at the tournament level," says
Yvonne Kronlage, the president of the Maryland Table Tennis
Association. Mrs. Kronlage had been selling a modest amount
of equipment for years out of her garage in Columbia, Md.
Last September, she began selling fairly expensive paddles
for tournament players from a pro shop in nearby Sykesville.
"Sales of expensive rackets, some over $50, were fairly
steady over the years, but now my sales have spurted 15% over
the past six months."
   Other entrepreneurs are meeting special needs. Harvard
Sports Inc., Compton, Calif., came up with a way to help the
retailer who wants to sell pingpong tables but dreads giving
up floor space to display them. The company began offering
stores special displays of corners of its tables to show how
they are made. Sales -- as flat as the tables themselves in
1988 -- rose 12% last year, says Daniel Messmer, the
president of Harvard Sports, a unit of Escalade Corp.,
Evansville, Ind.
   Table Tennis America, besides using retail outlets, is
marketing through wholesale clubs, which charge members a fee
for access to discount-priced goods. New outlets include
Price Club, based in California, and Sam's Wholesale Club,
part of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   Melba Martin, the president of Martin Kilpatrick Table
Tennis Co., Wilson, N.C., says she's going to more
sporting-goods shows to sell her products and has doubled the
size of her catalog, to 16 pages, during the past five years.
"I've also been promoting the sport by selling tables at
dealer price to the Baltimore school system," she says. "It's
a good investment in the future of the sport, which can only
help my business."
   Mrs. Martin adds: "Our business was fairly steady for the
past 27 years, but since the '88 Olympics we've had sales
spurts of 20% a year." Many pingpong suppliers expect the
industry's annual sales to reach $50 million in the next few
years, compared with $30 million currently.
   Entrepreneurs hope to benefit from increased promotion of
the sport. Although the U.S. pingpong team didn't win any
medals at the last Olympics, in South Korea last year,
Olympic funds for the first time are being pumped into
promoting the game in U.S. schools. And increased recognition
of the sport is prompting promoters to increase prizes in the
U.S. Table Tennis Open, to be held in Baltimore June 8-17.
The winner of the men's singles will get $20,000 this year,
up from $7,500 in previous years, says Scott Price, national
touring coach of the U.S. Table Tennis Association, based in
Colorado Springs, Colo. As a result, Mr. Price has gotten
national TV networks and sports-oriented cable-TV services to
present new and expanded features on the game.
   Mr. Price has just finished a 200-city promotional tour,
during which he trained 600 high school teachers to instruct
their students in the finer points of the game. And he has
persuaded the Boys Clubs of America, an organization of 1,300
clubs with 1.8 million members, to adopt pingpong as its
official sport.
   More than 19 million Americans play the game in their
garages, basements and family rooms. With the added luster of
the Olympics, the U.S. Table Tennis Association's ranks have
swelled 27% in the past year, to more than 6,500. That's
still a far cry from the 12 million registered players in
China. Top Chinese players long dominated world competition
until last year, when the Swedish team took all five spots in
championship matches (which are held every other year).
   Years ago, most top players in the U.S. played with
paddles faced with plain pimpled rubber. But in 1959, a
Japanese team playing with sponge rubber took top prizes in
the world matches. Most top players now use a layer of sponge
behind a smooth plasticized rubber that has the pimpled side
turned in. This rubber, joined to new types of woods with
better glues, is used to produce devastating spins.
   As top-priced equipment gets more expensive, some
entrepreneurs are capitalizing by offering less expensive
options. The U.S. Table Tennis Association recently
sanctioned high school players to train on undersized tables,
which cost less and save space. All-Luminum Products Inc.,
Philadelphia, began making a table measuring 3 feet by 6
feet, compared with the regulation 5-by-9.
   All-Luminum sold 25,000 reduced-size tables last year and
expects to sell at least twice as many this year, says Warren
Cohen, the president of All-Luminum. The product retails at
$129 or less, compared with $500 to $1,000 for full-sized
tables used in tournaments. All-Luminum even plans to sponsor
its own smaller-table tournaments this year and next, with
top prizes of $200 to $500.
