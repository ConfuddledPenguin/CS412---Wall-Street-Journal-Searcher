   Degussa AG said earnings declined in the six months ended
March 31 because of weaker profit at its chemical division.
   The West German metals and chemicals concern said
six-month group sales advanced 3% to 7.1 billion marks ($4.22
billion) from 6.86 billion marks a year earlier.

   Degussa didn't give any profit figures. At the annual
shareholder meeting, Chairman Gert Becker said negative
foreign exchange movements and rising competition caused
profit margins in the chemical sector to shrink.
   But Degussa's metals and pharmaceuticals division posted
higher earnings, and Mr. Becker said he is still confident
for fiscal 1990, which ends Sept. 30.
