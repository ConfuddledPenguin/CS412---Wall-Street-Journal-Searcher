   NEW YORK -- State insurance regulators are about to make
life tougher for the junk-bond market.
   Their actions won't be as drastic as Congress's ultimatum
to the savings-and-loan industry last summer, ordering
thrifts to sell all high-risk, high-yield junk bonds within
five years. But rule changes being devised by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners nonetheless are aimed
at reining in junk-bond investing by insurance companies.

   Insurers historically have accounted for about 30% of
junk-bond buying; at year-end 1989, they owned more than $38
billion of junk securities, according to Townsend &amp; Shuppe, a
Hartford, Conn. research firm. For most major insurers, junk
bonds constitute just a sliver of a widely diversified
portfolio. But a few insurance companies, notably First
Executive Corp., have piled one-third or more of their assets
into low-rated bonds, seeking higher yields. After the
junk-bond market's swoon of last year, regulators have grown
worried.
   "The whole problem of junk bonds has to be addressed,"
said Terrence Lennon, chief examiner of the New York State
Department of Insurance. Mr. Lennon heads a working committee
of the NAIC that earlier this month issued a proposal for
tough new reserve requirements for insurers' junk-bond
holdings, starting in 1991. The NAIC's proposals may be
modified a bit in the next month, but they are widely
expected to be adopted by state commissioners in June.
   The regulators' latest moves could spell more trouble for
the junk-bond market, which had finally begun to rally this
spring. "I'm sure there will be some fallout" from the new
insurance rules, said Linda Dougherty, a vice president at
Prudential Insurance Co. of America. "People won't want to
invest in these bonds until they see how things shake out."
   Others share Ms. Dougherty's worries. "We're all concerned
about what happened in the market when Congress declared that
the junk-bond portfolios of savings and loans had to be sold
within five years," said Robert Seiler, a senior vice
president at Allstate Insurance Co.
   Although no one is suggesting that insurance companies
should stop owning junk bonds, NAIC officials say that later
this year they may recommend that each state adopt some sort
of cap on the junk portfolios of insurers based in that
state. New York is one of the few states that currently
limits junk-bond portfolios; its cap is 20% of an insurer's
assets.
   For the time being, the NAIC's main junk-bond initiative
is to propose new reserve requirements for insurers' bond
portfolios, depending on credit quality. These rules would
introduce six credit categories, up from the current four.
And they would tilt more strongly than the current system in
favor of high-quality bond portfolios.
   In the new top category, for bonds rated triple-A to
single-A, insurance companies would be obliged to create a
statutory reserve of only 1% of the bond's value, built up
over 20 years. That's a lighter requirement than the current
2% reserve over 20 years.
   In most other categories, insurance companies would be
required to build larger statutory reserves faster than
before. The difference would be especially stark for about
400 speculative, single-B-rated bonds that had been treated
as solid investments under the old reserve system. Under the
new rules, insurance companies would be required to build up
a 10% reserve in five years, far more than the old
requirement of a 2% reserve over 20 years.
   Wall Street analysts say the new rules could push up an
insurance company's cost of owning those bonds by 0.5% to 2%
a year. The bigger reserve requirements also might slow an
insurance company's growth or even force it to unload junk
bonds to stay in compliance with the rules.
   Most large insurance companies have only 2% to 10% of
their assets in junk bonds, so the new rules aren't likely to
cause much upheaval in their portfolios. "This only affects a
handful of insurers," said Muriel Clemensen, head of
high-yield research at Citibank. "It doesn't affect the whole
industry."
   Still, Presidential Life Insurance Co. has about 25% of
its bond portfolio in junk bonds, and First Executive has an
even higher level. Executives at both those companies said
they were still studying the NAIC proposals and couldn't
comment on them.
   New York State's Mr. Lennon said he is "willing to look at
a phase-in" of the new reserve rules over two to three years,
so as not to cause undue market turmoil. He also said change
in insurance reserve rules is overdue anyway. "We're dealing
with an antiquated reporting structure that has been in place
for decades," Mr. Lennon said. "Nuances have grown in the
market. Greater refinement is needed."
   Junk-bond professionals, however, argue that their market
is being singled out unfairly for attention. "It's
interesting to see the insurance regulators descend upon
high-yield bonds as if they were the most critical issue,"
said Robert Long, director of high-yield research at First
Boston Corp. "Actually, problem real-estate loans are more
significant."
