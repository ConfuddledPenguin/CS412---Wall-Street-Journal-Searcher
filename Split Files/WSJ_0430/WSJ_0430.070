   DALLAS -- An uncompleted stock transfer cost the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. its claim to more than $50 million in
cash from the assets of First RepublicBank Corp., a
bankruptcy judge ruled.
   The ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven A. Felsenthal
will allow the creditors of the Texas bank-holding company to
share the cash under a reorganization plan that could be
approved as early as July.

   The cash comprises the proceeds, and interest earned, from
the holding company's 1989 sale of its Republic Money Orders
Inc. unit to Greyhound Corp. of Phoenix.
   The FDIC, which seized First RepublicBank's bank units in
late July 1988, claimed the proceeds because the holding
company had assigned its Republic Money Orders stock to the
company's Dallas bank in 1978.
   But the bank never took possession of the stock
certificate or assignment, and the holding company continued
to list the stock as an asset held in a safe-keeping account
at the Dallas bank.
   "Since the holding company did not deliver and the bank
did not obtain possession of the stock certificate with
attached assignment, First RepublicBank Corp. remained owner
of the Republic Money Orders stock as a matter of law," Judge
Felsenthal ruled.
   The judge rejected the FDIC's argument that the agreement
establishing the safe-keeping account should be set aside
because it wasn't approved by the bank's directors and wasn't
part of the records available to federal examiners before the
bank's seizure.
   "Absent the {safe-keeping} agreement, there was delivery
of the stock," said Jeffrey W. Hurt, a Dallas attorney for
the FDIC in the dispute. Mr. Hurt said he expects the FDIC to
appeal Judge Felsenthal's decision.
   The FDIC is the largest creditor of First RepublicBank
Corp., which entered Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings
Aug. 1, 1988, just days after the FDIC seized its bank units.
The holding company isn't related to First Republic Bancorp
of San Francisco.
