   THE ECONOMY APPEARS to have rebounded mildly in the first
quarter. GNP grew at a 2.1% rate, a slow but healthy pace and
nearly twice the fourth quarter's 1.1% rate. But a GNP
inflation index rose 6.5%, the sharpest gain in over eight
years. Most analysts expect the Fed to keep its credit policy
on hold, though some believe the worsening inflation could
prompt some tightening.
