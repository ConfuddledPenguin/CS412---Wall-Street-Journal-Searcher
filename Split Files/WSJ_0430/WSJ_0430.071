   TOKYO -- Japanese steel exports in the year ended March 31
fell 18% to 19 million metric tons, marking the fifth
consecutive annual decline from year-earlier levels, the
Japan Iron and Steel Federation said.
   Exports in fiscal 1990 fell to the lowest level in nearly
20 years, dropping below 20 million tons for the first time
since 1970. Steel exports for March followed the downward
trend, dropping 26% from a year earlier to 1.5 million metric
tons. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   Sluggish steel exports reflect consistently strong
domestic demand for Japanese steel products, the federation
said. As a result, an official said, Japanese steelmakers
were preoccupied during the year with meeting the needs of
domestic industries, such as shipbuilding, construction and
auto manufacturing.
   Export prices for the latest fiscal year rose to a
historic high of $774 a ton, the official said.
