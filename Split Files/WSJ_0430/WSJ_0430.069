   Television viewers, advertisers complain, often miss
commercials by flipping to another channel or by racing to
the refrigerator for a snack.
   They needn't worry with "Video Power," a syndicated show
about video games starting next fall that will blur the line
between commercials and programming. "Informercials" -- the
word used for the commercials by Alan Bohbot, the show's
producer -- will be spliced into the show so seamlessly that
kids might not know the difference.

   While critics may not be pleased, "we're ecstatic about
the format," exclaims Anthony Williams, an executive at
video-game maker Acclaim Entertainment Inc., which plans to
advertise on the show. "Video Power," he notes, will keep
kids glued to the set.
   "Video Power" is but one of a variety of creative new ways
that advertisers are slipping commercial messages into TV
programs, videocassettes, movies and video games aimed at
young people.
   McDonald's Corp., for example, has produced "McTreasure
Island," a video starring Ronald McDonald and pals in a
remake of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic. PepsiCo Inc.
has its label appear in a new Magic Johnson basketball video
game made by Tradewest. MTV may feature Worlds of Wonder
Inc.'s new Jaminator electric toy guitar on its Headbanger's
Ball program.
   "It's beyond commercial," says one MTV insider, noting
that inclusion of a brand name would be a departure from
MTV's standard practice of excising product promotions.
   Meanwhile, the related art of "product placement" in
movies has reached new heights. In "Back to the Future II," a
big favorite among children, more than a dozen brands were
strategically worked into the action.
   This trend toward blurring advertising with programming is
of growing concern to critics of children's shows. "It's
shameful and deceptive," declares Michael Jacobson, executive
director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
media watchdog in Washington, D.C. "Kids particularly are
vulnerable when they aren't told it's advertising. They don't
have their guard up."
   Thus far, critics haven't formally taken aim at disguised
ads, which aren't currently banned on television. They're
busy lobbying Congress to impose a limit on commercials
during kids' shows, because a previous ban of 12 minutes an
hour on weekdays and 9.5 minutes an hour on weekends was
lifted by the Reagan administration. But just as the critics
are making headway in Washington, some of the new ways of
promoting products could circumvent any time restrictions on
commercials.
   "Video Power," a half-hour show that will air weekdays
after school, will be "hosted" by a 14-year-old who goes by
the name of Johnny Arcade. Johnny will rattle off "news"
items, such as countdowns of top hits in video games.
Sandwiched in the minute-long countdowns will be 10-second or
20-second commercials, without so much as a pause between the
news and the commercial.
   The show also will include interviews with video-game
champions and celebrities, and it will feature cartoons with
characters from current video games. A few of those
characters are based on video games by Acclaim, which has
purchased 20% of the show's commercial time. Toys "R" Us Inc.
and NEC Corp. also have agreed to buy similar chunks of air
time.
   "Children change channels during commercials. For one
thing, their concentration span is shorter than that of
adults," says Mr. Williams, the Acclaim executive. "This, we
think, is a good way for both producer and advertiser to
sidestep that problem."
   Adds Mr. Bohbot, the program's creator: "Kids see an
average of 100 commercials every day, and between 30,000 to
40,000 a year. How does an advertiser's message stand out
through all of this? All we're trying to do is let the kid
walk away remembering the commercial."
   Peggy Charren, who heads the Boston-based Action for
Children's Television and is a frequent critic of commercial
programming, says she will monitor "Video Power" closely to
see that commercials are clearly identified in the TV show.
"If we don't stop it, there won't be editorial speech as such
any more," she contends.
   In McDonald's newly released "McTreasure Island" video,
Ronald McDonald and a retinue of characters open the Treasure
Island storybook and are magically transported into the tale.
Ronald uses his magic time and again to save Jim Hawkins, the
Stevenson hero, from the wiles of Long John Silver.
Eventually, the McDonald's characters stumble onto the
treasure and steer Long John Silver away from it so Hawkins's
crew can have it.
   About 250,000 copies of the videocassette have been sold
to retailers, notes Russ Kamalski, director of marketing of
Hi-Tops Video, the children's brand of Media Home
Entertainment Inc., which co-produced the video. Mr. Kamalski
adds that initial sales of the 30-minute home video, which
retails for less than $10, seem good enough for McDonald's to
attempt a similar project. McDonald's didn't return phone
calls seeking comment.
   "It's too bad Robert Louis Stevenson isn't around to sue
McDonald's," laments Ms. Charren. "Now, every time children
read that famous young readers' classic, they'll get hungry
for a Big Mac," she says. "I wonder what we're going to get
next? Ronald McDonald goes hunting for whales in `Moby
McDonald?'"
   McDonald's also figured prominently in the movie "Mac &amp;
Me" a couple of years ago, a film about the misadventures of
a mysterious alien creature (hence the name Mac) who
inadvertently lands on Earth. In addition to more than a
half-dozen references to Coke -- the cola brand carried by
McDonald's restaurants -- the movie had a six-minute
intergalactic dance scene in and outside a McDonald's
restaurant, its golden arches clearly in view. "What's really
disturbing are the commercial implications of `Mac &amp; Me,'"
wrote movie critic Richard Harrington of the Washington Post.
   Some movies resemble billboards on film with all the
brand-name products they feature. The recent release, "The
Wizard," features Nintendo Co. video games and Mattel Inc.'s
Power Glove, a video-game joystick used with Nintendo. "The
Wizard is one long Nintendo commercial," notes Mark Crespin
Miller, a communications professor at Johns Hopkins
University who's writing a book on the pervasive nature of
advertising.
   "It's almost become embarrassing," says Edward Mintz,
president of CinemaScore, a market research firm that helps
advertisers get products "placed" in films. Hollywood rakes
in about $1 million a week in product placement fees, more
than triple its take four years ago, placement executives
say.
   "Back to the Future II," starring Michael J. Fox, stuck
viewers with a shopping cart full of brand names: Toyota,
Miller, Nike, AT&amp;T, USA Today, Texaco, JVC, Black &amp; Decker,
US Mail Overnight Service, Pizza Hut and Pepsi (several
times), among others. "Pepsi was quite pleased {with the
movie}," says Mr. Mintz, who gets paid only when products
score well in viewer-recall surveys.
   A coming attraction, "U.S. Steal," a New Line Cinema Corp.
picture starring Hulk Hogan, also will display a host of
products, placed by Marvin Cohen, head of Marvin Cohen &amp;
Associates. "I'll have no trouble finding advertisers," he
says. "Hulk Hogan is a role model for kids."
   Unlike television, which is regulated by the Federal
Communications Commission, films and videos don't face
restrictions because of constitutional free-speech
protections. "There isn't a heck of a lot we can do," says
Ms. Charren, the children's-TV critic.
