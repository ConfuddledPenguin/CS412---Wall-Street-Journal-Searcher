   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. reported a
first-quarter loss of $46.6 million, or 68 cents a share,
despite one-time gains of $173 million from the sale of
assets.
   In the 1989 first quarter, the bank holding company posted
a profit of $42.3 million, or 60 cents a share -- before a
surge in troubled real estate loans led to a $1.11 billion
loss for the year.

   Bank of New England, now struggling for its survival, said
the latest quarterly results reflect a $20 million operating
loss, a $151 million provision for possible loan losses and a
$48 million reserve for foreclosed real estate.
   Nonperforming assets, which include foreclosed real estate
and loans on which payments are past due or likely to become
delinquent, rose to $2.67 billion from $2.2 billion at Dec.
31. Total assets, meanwhile, dropped to $24.9 billion from
$29.77 billion as the company scrambled to raise cash and
prop up its capital ratios by selling off some of its most
marketable assets.
   "As I said when I joined Bank of New England {in March},
our recovery will be difficult and it will be measured in
years," said Lawrence Fish, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   In a statement, Mr. Fish said the company has now reviewed
"over 85% of our loans and 100% of our real estate loans, and
we believe the picture of the loan portfolio represented by
these numbers is accurate and complete at this time. We also
feel that the loan-loss provision is appropriate given the
current uncertainties about the economic environment."
   Mr. Fish said he believes the company is "on the road to
becoming a smaller, well-reserved, profitable bank." As
recent steps toward that goal, he cited an increase in the
capital ratio to 1.65% from 1.54% at Dec. 31, growth in core
retail deposits, an increase in loss reserves as a percentage
of loans and leases, and $300 million in projected savings
from staffing and other overhead reductions.
   But securities analysts, while generally giving the
company high marks for its recent efforts, said the $470
million increase in nonperforming assets shows how tough it
will be to reverse the company's slide unless the outlook for
the New England economy brightens soon.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Bank of New England stock slipped 12.5 cents to
$3.625.
   Net interest income for the quarter was $161 million,
compared with $262 million in the year-ago quarter. The net
interest margin shrank to 2.65% from 3.69% a year earlier,
largely because of the higher levels of nonperforming assets.
   Figures supplied by the company show that core retail
deposits -- certificates of deposit, checking accounts,
savings accounts, and money market accounts issued through
its branch network -- have stabilized at about $15 billion
since early February. The company, which had $18.7 billion in
such deposits in mid-December, had experienced a sharp
outflow after it began to disclose its loan problems.
   But stanching the outflow has come at a price: Bank of New
England has been offering some of the highest deposit rates
in the nation -- another reason for its slim interest margin.
