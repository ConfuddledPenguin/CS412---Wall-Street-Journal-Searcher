C.R. Bard Inc. filed a suit in federal court here alleging
that SciMed is infringing on a C.R. Bard heart-catheter
patent.

   SciMed, a medical products maker, has run into other legal
troubles. Two suits by an Eli Lilly &amp; Co. unit, which allege
that SciMed infringed on Lilly heart-catheter patents, are
still pending, according to Mr. Spencer, who was reached at
home.
   Officials of C.R. Bard, based in Murray Hill, N.J.,
