   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee is considering granting
Michael Milken immunity to testify on his junk bond network,
sources on the panel said, and a spokesman for Mr. Milken
said the financier would accept such an offer.
   The testimony, which the House Oversight and
Investigations subcommittee hopes to schedule for late this
summer, could provide the first public forum for Mr. Milken
to discuss in detail the operations of the junk bond market
he created, as well as the government's case against him. The
former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond
department pleaded guilty last week to six felony counts,
including conspiracy and securities fraud, and agreed to pay
$600 million in fines and restitution.

   At the same time, the subcommittee hopes to question Mr.
Milken about 400 investment partnerships that involved Mr.
Milken and other Drexel employees. The panel, a part of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, held hearings two years ago
about the dealings of such partnerships in Drexel bond
issues. In recent weeks the panel has learned of an
additional 200 partnerships it didn't know of in 1988, a
staff member said.
   The subcommittee has asked Congress's investigative arm,
the General Accounting Office, to study the partnerships and
try to determine if they allowed Drexel insiders to benefit
at the expense of customers. At the hearings two years ago,
members of Congress charged that Drexel repeatedly ignored
the interests of its bond-buying clients, such as mutual
funds and insurance companies, by selling large blocks of new
issues of high-yield bonds to investment partnerships that
included about 150 Drexel officials. The partnerships often
resold the bonds at a profit within days or weeks.
   At the hearings, Drexel's chief executive officer,
Frederick Joseph, defended the operations of the
partnerships, saying that Drexel had "procedures in place" to
ensure employees didn't have an unfair advantage. Mr. Joseph
argued that the quick profits made by some of the
partnerships resulted from rapidly changing interest rates
and other market conditions. A week later, however, Drexel
stopped allowing its employees to buy parts of new debt
issues because of "public perception," Mr. Joseph said.
   The GAO hasn't begun its review of the partnerships, so it
is unclear what new information may emerge. However, a
subcommittee staff member said it appeared that Mr. Milken
participated in most of the partnerships.
   Mr. Milken refused to testify at the 1988 hearings, citing
his Fifth Amendment rights. If the subcommittee grants him
immunity, his testimony couldn't be used against him in any
legal proceeding. As part of last week's plea agreement, the
Justice Department cannot bring any further cases against Mr.
Milken relating to his work or investments while at Drexel.
But Mr. Milken is already the target of civil suits by
investors and others who claim they were defrauded.
   If the subcommittee "were to offer him immunity, then
Michael would testify," said Kenneth Lerer, a spokesman for
Mr. Milken. Mr. Lerer wouldn't comment on any of the
activities of the investment partnerships.
   The dealings of the partnerships weren't a target of the
original 98-count indictment against Mr. Milken, nor of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's civil complaint, which
was also settled last week. The government has never charged
that any of the actions of the partnerships were illegal.
