   FHP INTERNATIONAL Corp.'s recently reported fiscal third
quarter earnings of 35 cents a share were about in line with
analysts' average estimate of 34 cents a share. Because the
estimate was incorrect in Thursday's Quarterly Earnings
Surprises table, due to a database error at Zacks Investment
Research, the company's results shouldn't have been included
among negative surprises.
