   Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, Italy's state energy
conglomerate, said 1989 earnings rose 23% to 1.613 trillion
lire ($1.31 billion) from 1.31 trillion lire a year earlier.
   The results fell short of ENI's October estimate of 1.7
trillion lire in profit, partly because of disappointing
earnings in its chemical sector. ENI is composed of 278
operating companies with interests in oil exploration,
refining, distribution, engineering and services.
