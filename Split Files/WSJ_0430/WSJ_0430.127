   OTTAWA -- G.D. Searle &amp; Co.'s Canadian unit awarded a
research grant of one million Canadian dollars (US$860,000)
to a University of Calgary research team that responded to a
Searle scientific challenge in Canadian newspapers.
   In full-page advertisements in several Canadian newspapers
last year, Searle invited proposals for a new, simple
technique of detecting stomach ulcers caused by arthritis
medicines.

   Chicago-based Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co., St. Louis,
is believed to be the first drug company to use newspaper ads
for such a purpose, a spokeswoman for Searle Canada Inc.
said. Research solicitations usually are made in medical and
scientific publications. Searle's ads drew 125 inquiries, and
detailed proposals were requested from 11 of the respondents.
These were assessed by a panel of independent scientists,
which unanimously recommended the University of Calgary
team's submission.
   The Calgary team's proposal involves a blood or urine test
for detecting stomach damage caused by arthritis medicines.
Now, the main method of identifying or confirming such
stomach damage is a costly and uncomfortable procedure called
endoscopy, which involves inserting a tube down a patient's
throat into the stomach.
   Arthritis medicines damage cells that line the stomach,
giving rise to substances that may be detected with blood or
urine tests, the University of Calgary team said. The team's
members include Drs. Jonathan Meddings, John Wallace and
Lloyd Sutherland, all physicians.
