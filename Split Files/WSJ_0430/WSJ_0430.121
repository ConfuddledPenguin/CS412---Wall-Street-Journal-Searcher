   NEW YORK -- Trading in London and New York futures markets
was cut short Friday because of a communications breakdown in
New York and by a bomb scare on one London exchange.
   Late Friday, a spokesman for the Commodity Exchange
Center, which directs operations of the five futures
exchanges here, said that technicians had "sidestepped an
electric short in the distribution system. We have not yet
solved the problem but we are operational at the moment."

   He said the problem was expected to be corrected by the
opening of trading today. Computers were functioning
properly, but the problem was in the network that sends
information out to customers' price-quotation tickers, he
said.
   The five exchanges affected here are the Commodity
Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, the New York
Cotton Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New
York Futures Exchange. All ceased trading about 90 minutes
earlier than usual.
   On the London Futures and Options Exchange, trading had
hardly begun when it was stopped by a bomb scare. The
exchange reopened at 2:30 p.m. London time, to have a closing
call. The exchange trades coffee, sugar, cocoa and gas
(heating) oil futures.
   New York analysts and dealers said it was the first time
they can recall trading being disrupted in both New York and
London futures markets on the same day.
