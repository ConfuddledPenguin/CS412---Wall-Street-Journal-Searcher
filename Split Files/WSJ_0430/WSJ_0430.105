   All Pulling Together,
   To Get the Carrot

   INCENTIVES are filtering down to the factory floor.
   It used to be incentives were just for managers, but now,
more companies are dangling monetary rewards to motivate
groups of lower-level employees. A new survey by consultants
Towers Perrin shows that half of such group incentive plans
found at 144 companies came into being in the past two years.
   After severely paring staff in recent years, companies
view performance and profit incentives as a way to squeeze
quality and productivity improvements from remaining workers,
while giving them greater control over their financial fates.
   At Borden Inc., some 28,000 workers at 180 different
plants can win bonuses ranging from $250 to $800 each this
year, depending on how their individual plants perform
against a variety of attendance, safety, quality, production
and financial goals.
   These plans were revised from one a few years back in
which Borden tried to peg incentives to return on equity. The
food-products company concluded that such a technical
financial target was "too difficult for the hourly employee
to understand," says Allan L. Miller, senior vice president
and chief administrative officer.
   Towers Perrin agrees, saying incentive plans work best
when workers can actually see how they influence targets, as
in the case of reducing waste or improving products coming
off their production line.
   Among the plans Towers Perrin studied, payments to workers
for meeting or exceeding group goals averaged $1,300 per
participant. "Companies are using these programs as a way to
create a competitive advantage through their work force,"
says James E. Nickel, head of the firm's alternative rewards
practice.
   Under 13 of 21 incentive plans at Monsanto Co., rewards
aren't simply add-on bonuses, but represent a share of
scheduled salary increases. Meeting goals brings employees up
to par; exceeding them means extra cash.
   "We used to focus on pay to attract, retain and motivate,"
says Barry Bingham, Monsanto's corporate compensation
director. "Now, we're using pay as a tool to drive results."
                                                                                                       

   Push a Phone Button,
   Save Mundane Steps
                                                                                                       

   PUSH-BUTTON phones, with new uses, are becoming an
important corporate tool to increase efficiency and reduce
tedium for workers.
   Employees of Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., a New
Jersey utility, can call a special line and run through
push-button programs to check health benefits or arrange
loans from their pension plans. Burroughs Wellcome runs a
computerized line that screens for experience and career
interests and then describes jobs for which callers are
qualified.
   While such systems, costing as much as $200,000, can give
companies an excuse to eliminate jobs, they can also "free
human resources and administrative people from answering
routine and mundane questions, to use their skills in other
areas," says Nenette Kress, a consultant with Coopers &amp;
Lybrand and a manager of the firm's communications practice.
   Under pressure to quickly dissolve a $100-million employee
stock ownership plan to avoid a $10-million tax penalty,
Nabisco Brands Inc. last fall asked 12,000 people to call in
push-button instructions for handling proceeds from their
accounts. Many called the line after work and fewer than 50
queries a day were handled by a staffed help line, says Steve
Awerman, manager of savings plan administration at the RJR
Nabisco Inc. unit.
   By contrast, he says, manually managing the tender offer
vote among stock-holding employees during the buy-out of RJR
earlier last year was a disaster. It took twice as long, he
says, with four benefits department employees handling up to
400 queries a day for weeks.
                                                                                                       

   Top Execs Are Loyal,
   But First to Themselves
                                                                                                       

   WITH THE AX swinging and job-security waning among middle
managers and hourly employees, high-level executives may be
the only ones upholding corporate loyalty these days. Or are
they?
   A new survey suggests that allegiance to company is
wavering at the top, too. Of 551 senior executives
questioned, more than 90% said they are loyal to their
subordinates and are willing to work "beyond what is
expected" by their companies. But at the same time, nearly
half said they are "always interested in other career
opportunities" while just one-third said they aren't.
   "It says something about the position they're in," says
Charles C. Jett, a partner with McFeely Wackerle Jett, the
Chicago executive search firm that sponsored the survey. "If
you're LBO'd out of existence, you're in outplacement, so
you'd better keep your ear to the ground."
   While several executives said companies could renew a
tradition of loyalty by investing more in employee career
training and development, others were more cynical. One
wrote: "Maybe you cannot be loyal to or expect loyalty from
anything that does not bleed when cut."

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   IN TO AFRICA: Two American black M.B.A. students from the
University of Virginia's Darden School of Business spent
their spring break last month in South Africa, cultivating
corporate contacts and exploring a possible exchange program
between the U.S. school and the University of Witwatersrand
Business School in Johannesburg. . . . "Z" is the author of
