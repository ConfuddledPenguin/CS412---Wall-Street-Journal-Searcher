   Gets Even Bigger

   NEW YORK -- Consumer spending has long accounted for about
two-thirds of the nation's gross national product. But with
plant-and-equipment outlays rising only modestly, exports
unlikely to surge and government at all levels forced to hold
down expenditures, consumption may play a bigger-than-ever
role in determining whether America's 7 1/2-year expansion
can keep going.
   Economists at WEFA Group, a Philadelphia consulting firm,
estimate that "roughly 75% of the growth in 1990 will be
accounted for by consumer spending, and three-quarters of
that will be solely due to growth in expenditures on consumer
services."

   Moreover, the consumer, as an economic forecaster,
produces. Fabian Linden, the executive director of the
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, says its
consumer confidence index has often signaled turning points
accurately. He notes, for example, that a special survey
shortly after the October 1987 stock-market crash indicated,
in contrast to many forecasts, that the economy wouldn't
plunge into a recession. And it didn't.
                                                                                                       

   So, what are consumers saying now? Clearly, they are
cautious. Their spending rose 0.4% in February, mostly
because of rising prices. "In real terms, consumer spending
was flat," economists at Merrill Lynch comment. "After
adjusting for inflation, spending on durable goods declined
2.9% because car sales weakened substantially. Spending on
nondurables was up 0.3%, and spending on services rose 0.8%."
                                                                                                       

   When it comes to retail sales alone (excluding services),
the message is particularly scrambled. They were distorted by
unusually cold weather in December and unusually warm weather
subsequently. In addition, auto sales have been driven up and
down by buyer-incentive programs.
   In March, retail sales fell 0.6%. However, Edward Yardeni,
an economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, notes that their
"January jump was so big that the first quarter's sales
average was 10% above the fourth quarter's average, at an
annual rate."
   What determines consumer spending?
   Above all, consumers tend to spend if they have the money.
So, their spending is strongly influenced by the level of
economic activity -- much as that activity is influenced by
consumer spending. And as employment in the relatively stable
service industries bulks larger and larger in the economy,
personal-income numbers should become more and more stable.
   Right now, the numbers are reassuring. Personal income
rose 0.7% in January and 0.9% in February. Further gains seem
likely. In March, civilian unemployment fell to 5.2%, and
workers' weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose 0.1%.
                                                                                                       

   Looking ahead, the forecasters surveyed monthly by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators recently raised their consensus
forecast for inflation-adjusted growth in 1990 GNP to 1.9%.
For disposable personal income, they now expect a 2.2% gain.
And they predict 2.3% increases in both statistics next year.
                                                                                                       

   However, "in addition to growth in total personal income,"
Reeder's Economic Digest observes, "consumers' spending
decisions are influenced by the rate of inflation, the level
of interest rates, the amount of installment debt they
already have, and factors such as whether or not auto
manufacturers are offering rebates." Mr. Linden, commenting
on "the stuff that shapes the consumer's view of the
economy," cites such things as "more or fewer overtime hours
on the job than the week before, the expansion or contraction
of their plant's night shift, rumor that the company's back
orders are strong or weak."
   Of such factors, the WEFA economists conclude that
"consumer confidence is most closely tied to inflation.
Hence, unless there is a sharp rise in inflation, there will
not be a decline in confidence of the magnitude or duration
that preceded previous recessions in the past 25 years."
   The March report on consumer prices showed a disquieting
upswing in inflationary pressure. Even earlier, Norman
Robertson, the chief economist at Mellon Bank, warned that
"recent income gains have been eroded by rising prices.
Adjusted for inflation, wages and salaries are now rising at
a yearly rate of about 2.5%, well under the 3.7% pace
registered during 1989.
   "Moreover," he added, "consumers are spending less of
their income. The personal savings rate is currently in the
vicinity of 5.5%, somewhat below the historical norm but
significantly above the average of 4% reported in the late
1980s."
                                                                                                       

   The growth in consumer installment debt has slowed. In
February, it rose at only a 5.7% annual rate, the smallest
increase since last October. Revolving credit, largely bank
cards and retail borrowing, grew at a mere 2.9% annual rate.
Consumer-loan delinquencies are rising, and lenders have
grown wary.
                                                                                                       

   Consumers' currently conservative stance, if not carried
too far, seems beneficial. "They are building a foundation
for maintaining spending at current or higher levels," says
Alexander P. Paris of Barrington Research Associates.
   And apparently becoming a bit more confident. The
Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose last month,
in the first significant gain in five months -- though it
remained well below the March 1989 reading. "In looking
ahead," Mr. Linden says, "people are now more optimistic than
in the first two months of the year."
   That confidence suggests that consumers will keep
bolstering economic growth for the foreseeable future -- at
least until they are hit by some unexpected economic blow.
