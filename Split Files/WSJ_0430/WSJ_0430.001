   BOSTON -- Researchers here reported that kidney-cancer
patients receiving a new therapy survived on average about
2.5 times as long as control patients who didn't get the
treatment.
   The treatment involves use of patients' own immune cells,
hence doesn't require Food and Drug Administration approval
for marketing, said officials with Cellcor Therapies Inc., a
start-up company here that is commercializing the therapy. It
will be immediately available to limited numbers of patients
and is expected to be more widely available within a few
months, they added.

   Cancer experts cautioned that nobody has tried to
replicate the new therapy's results yet -- new cancer
treatments often don't live up to their initial promise.
Furthermore, they noted, the new therapy didn't cause as much
tumor reduction in the patients as doctors would expect,
considering the patients' lengthened survival found by the
Boston researchers.
   But if the initial results with the therapy can be
extended to many patients, it would represent a major
breakthrough in treating kidney cancer. Currently there is no
good treatment for the disease, which kills about 10,000
Americans annually.
   Called autolymphocyte therapy, or ALT, the treatment was
developed by a team led by Michael E. Osband at the Boston
University School of Medicine and Boston's New England
Baptist Hospital. Dr. Osband is also Cellcor's executive vice
president. His method entails extraction of some of a cancer
patient's white blood cells, which help fight off infections
and are thought to attack tumor cells. The cells are combined
in a test tube with lymphokines -- substances that serve as
the immune system's chemical messengers -- which are derived
separately from the patient's immune cells via a special
process.
   In the test tube, the lymphokines activate dormant immune
cells via mechanisms not fully understood. When the activated
cells -- which the researchers believe are mainly a subset of
the immune system called helper T cells -- are reinjected
into the patients, they apparently stimulate the immune
system to attack the tumor cells.
   In a study reported in Saturday's issue of the British
medical journal Lancet, 45 patients received the new
treatment plus Tagamet, an anti-ulcer drug that past studies
indicate helps beef up cancer patients' immune responses
against tumor cells. A control group of 45 patients got
Tagamet alone.
   Patients in both groups had similar cases of metastatic
cancer, in which tumors are spreading widely through the
body. At the conclusion of the study, in which the median
patient follow-up was 15 months, 32 of the patients on the
new therapy were alive, compared with 19 in the control
group.
   The side effects of the new treatment, mainly mild fever,
were minor compared with those of conventional cancer
therapies. However, men getting the new treatment responded
much better than did women in the study. That may have been
due to higher levels in male patients' lymphokines of an
immune booster called interleukin-1, or IL-1, said Dr.
Osband. Higher levels of IL-1 were correlated with longer
survival in the study, he added. The researchers now plan to
try a variation of the treatment in which extra IL-1 is added
to immune cells before reinjection.
   The new treatment resembles promising cancer therapies
developed during the past few years at the National Cancer
Institute by Steven A. Rosenberg. However, the Boston
treatment apparently involves different immune cells and
doesn't entail giving patients an immune-boosting substance
called interleukin-2, as does Dr. Rosenberg's method.
   Cellcor, a closely held company founded in 1987, plans to
offer the treatment as a service at major hospitals in
Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles by the end
of 1990, said Gary Cashon, president and chief executive
officer. The treatment, which requires a six-month course of
therapy costing $20,000 to $25,000, now is offered only in
Boston.
