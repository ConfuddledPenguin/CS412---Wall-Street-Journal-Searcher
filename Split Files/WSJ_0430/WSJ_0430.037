   Machine tool orders in March rebounded from the weak
levels of the previous five months, aided by a large order
from a Soviet auto plant.
   However, U.S. durable goods manufacturers still aren't
buying machinery as aggressively as they were a year ago,
machine tool producers say. And a recent Commerce Department
survey of capital spending plans isn't very reassuring.

   Domestic machine tool plants received $265.9 million of
orders in March, up 37% from February's $194.6 million.
However, bookings remained 8.5% below the $290.5 million of a
year earlier, according to NMTBA -- The Association for
Manufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group.
   During the the last quarter of 1989 and the first two
months of this year, monthly orders ranged between $184.5
million and $206.3 million.
   Machine tools are complex, often computer-controlled,
machines that form metal parts ranging from truck axles to
cooking pots, and thus are a good indicator of factory
spending.
   Machine tool distributors, who handle foreign-made
machines as well as U.S. equipment, also experienced an order
upturn. Orders in March were 7.6% higher than in February and
about 25% higher than the dismal levels of December and
January, according to the American Machine Tool Distributors'
Association, Rockville, Md. However, distributor orders were
down 8.4% from a year earlier.
   The orders at U.S. machine tool plants included a $38
million contract received by Cross &amp; Trecker Corp.,
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., from a Soviet auto plant. Cross &amp;
Trecker actually received Soviet orders totaling $63 million,
but $25 million of the machines will be produced by the
company's West German subsidiary and therefore weren't
included in the NMTBA figures.
   Cross &amp; Trecker said the equipment will be shipped in
1991, and that the company will be paid in dollars and West
German marks. Although the company declined to provide
details on the machinery involved, the Cross unit that
received the orders builds transfer lines that automatically
machine parts at high volume as they are moved from one
machine to another.
   The Soviets are discussing ambitious plans to expand auto
output as a key part of their efforts to satisfy demand for
additional consumer goods, according to an official of Litton
Industrial Automation, Hebron, Ky., a unit of Litton
Industries Inc. The official, who recently returned from a
trip to the Soviet Union, said U.S. and Western European
companies will receive additional orders if those plans are
carried out.
   In recent years, however, the Soviets have purchased only
a small amount of U.S. equipment. Machine tool builders
shipped $21.9 million of machines to the Soviets last year,
just over 2% of U.S. machine tool exports, NMTBA said. And
last year's Soviet sales exceeded the $16.4 million for the
previous seven years combined.
   Domestic orders for lathes, machining centers and other
standard machine tools have been weak in March and April,
several major machine tool producers said. Customers continue
to ask for price quotations, but aren't signing orders.
However, producers of commercial aircraft and airplane parts
are ordering sophisticated production systems and other
specialized machines.
   At Cross &amp; Trecker, the domestic automotive picture has
brightened, a spokesman said. "Some of the projects that have
been kicked around for awhile" may turn into solid orders in
the next few months, he added. Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, also
has seen a recovery in orders from automotive concerns. For
much of 1989 and early 1990, delays in auto plant
re-equipment programs were a major factor in the drop in
machine tool orders.
   The automotive outlook still isn't particularly bright,
however. The Commerce Department's latest survey of 1990
capital spending plans indicates that motor vehicle producers
expect to invest 11% less this year than in 1989. Overall,
U.S. capital spending will be up 7.8% this year, according to
the survey, but durable goods producers, who buy most machine
tools, will invest only 2.1% more than in 1989.
   Domestic machine tool plants in March received $198.2
million of orders for lathes, machining centers, transfer
lines, boring mills, grinders, milling machines and other
machines that shape metal by cutting, up 70% from the
previous month but still 10% below the $220.6 million of a
year earlier, NMTBA said.
   Orders for metal-forming presses and other machines to
shape metal with pressure were $67.7 million, down 3.2% from
$69.9 million a year earlier.
   Shipment of all types of machine tools in March totaled
$288.9 million, NMTBA said, down 5.8% from $306.7 million a
year earlier.
