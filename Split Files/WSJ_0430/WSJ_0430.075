   Digital Equipment Corp., burdened by soaring personnel
costs in a period of slack sales growth, is moving more
slowly than expected with its effort to reduce its huge work
force.
   The big computer maker, based in Maynard, Mass., said it
expects 2,000 employees will leave by its fiscal year end on
July 1, out of a total of 5,000 who will be offered voluntary
severance packages by that time. As of March 31, Digital's
work force stood at 125,800.

   Digital also indicated that an expected fourth-quarter
charge against earnings may not be necessary. If 2,000
employees leave, "then the restructuring charge already
announced will be adequate to cover separation costs," a
spokesman said. Digital took a $150 million charge in the
third quarter for work-force reduction costs, and had warned
that further charges were likely in coming quarters.
   After the charge, third-quarter net income fell 90% from
the year-earlier period, while revenue grew just 4.3%. Those
results reflect the weakness of much of the computer industry
over the past year.
   The disclosure marked the first time Digital outlined the
scope of the staff-reduction program. But the numbers fall
well short of earlier indications by people inside the
company and the forecasts of many analysts, who had predicted
cutbacks ranging from 5,000 to 8,000.
   "If this is it, Wall Street is likely to be disappointed,"
Carol Muratore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said.
"It's no surprise they're moving slowly, but I don't think
2,000 is enough."
   Digital shares dropped $1.375, to close at $82, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
   Digital didn't exactly say that it is finished in making
cuts. The spokesman said that results of the voluntary
severance program will be evaluated at the end of the fiscal
year, and "if there is another program . . . it is likely to
be different" from the current program. The current incentive
program provides insurance benefits for a year and lump-sum
payments of between 40 weeks' and two years' salary,
depending on length of service.
   The spokesman emphasized that no layoffs are planned.
Through the voluntary program, Digital has eliminated jobs at
plants in Phoenix, Ariz., and Colorado Springs, and
facilities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
