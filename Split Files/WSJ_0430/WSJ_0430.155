   Federal regulators seized yet another large California
thrift, Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan Association, just weeks
after the company's parent, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara,
completed a recapitalization that left it nominally solvent.
   Santa Barbara Savings is one of several of California's
biggest S&amp;Ls that have failed recently, or are in danger of
failing, because of a second wave of problems brought on by
ill-fated diversification either outside the state or outside
traditional home-loan lending.

   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association of Beverly Hills and
Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Van Nuys, for instance,
currently are insolvent but haven't yet been seized; other
thrifts, such as Far West Savings &amp; Loan of Newport Beach, a
unit of Far West Financial Corp. and Great American Bank of
San Diego, have lost most of their tangible capital and are
struggling to survive.
   In an earlier round of problems, some of the state's
biggest thrifts, including Lincoln Savings of Irvine and
Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, were taken over by
regulators.
   In contrast, about four or five other giant California
thrifts are thriving, partly because their troubled
competitors are being restricted in bidding for deposits or
loans.
   On Friday, the Financial Corp. thrift unit called its
seizure by the Office of Thrift Supervision "a complete
surprise." Just last week, the parent Financial Corp.
reported first-quarter net income of $37.7 million, or $1.71
a share, including a $36.5 million extraordinary gain from a
debt-for-equity swap.
   Philip Brinkerhoff, Financial Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, called the debt swap "an incredible boon
to our capital position," adding: "We will continue to
aggressively pursue opportunities to increase capital,
including capital infusion or sale."
   But while the one-time gain eliminated a tangible-capital
deficit, it still left the thrift unit with only about
one-third of the capital required by regulators, and little
or no operating profit. The parent, which has $4.7 billion of
assets, incurred a loss of $60.3 million, or $10.01 a share,
for all of 1989.
   Moreover, the parent company recently let go its auditor,
Deloitte &amp; Touche, after the accounting firm refused to issue
an opinion concerning the 1989 financial statement due to
"material weakness in internal controls," according to a
Financial Corp. news release.
   Regulators are apt to move swiftly against an even
nominally solvent S&amp;L if they find evidence that the thrift
has insufficient controls to monitor and stanch losses. The
OTS already had prohibited Santa Barbara Savings from making
new loans, an order considered by some regulators to be
tantamount to a death sentence. Regulators were unavailable
for comment over the weekend.
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Financial Corp. closed at 25 cents a share, off
3.125 cents.
   Separately, Resolution Trust Corp., created under the
thrift-bailout bill to manage failed institutions, said it
approved the sale of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan in
Bakersfield, Calif., for $1.5 million to Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association, a unit of BankAmerica
Corp. Under the sale, the BankAmerica unit will assume $125.2
million in deposits and secured liabilities.
   The BankAmerica unit will acquire $78.3 million of the
failed Bakersfield institution's assets, which include $21.5
million in cash and $56.8 million in loans.
