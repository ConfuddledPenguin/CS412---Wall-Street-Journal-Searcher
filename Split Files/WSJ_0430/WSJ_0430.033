   NEW YORK -- Everyone knows the mystery engulfing Twin
Peaks, the fictional town in the Pacific Northwest: who
killed Laura Palmer, the high school cheerleader who led a
double life.
   But there is another, more intriguing, puzzle: What is
happening to the viewers?

   "Twin Peaks," on Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s TV network and
arguably the most original prime-time series in years, is
suffering audience erosion. When the show had its special
two-hour movie premiere earlier this month, it was watched by
35 million viewers.
   The audience has declined since then, however, and last
Thursday's episode, the third weekly episode, had about 16.7
million viewers, according to figures released by A.C.
Nielsen Co. Specifically, "Twin Peaks" finished with an 11.3
rating and 18 share. A rating point represents 921,000
television households and a share is the percentage of sets
in use.
   Not surprisingly, rival National Broadcasting Co., a
subsidiary of General Electric Co., reacted with glee. It
continued to win the 9 p.m. hour with the situation comedies
"Cheers" and "Wings." The shows had a combined 19.4 rating
and 31 share. "An 18 share is what `The Young Riders' was
doing when ABC pulled it," said Preston Beckman, vice
president of audience research at NBC.
   Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior vice president of research,
said he was not surprised at the audience falloff for "Twin
Peaks," which has come from women, 50 years old and older and
men 35 years old and older.
   "The show has basically taken up a traditional ABC
profile, which is comprised mostly of younger women" he said.
"This isn't a surprise. What was a surprise was the initial
broad appeal of the show."
   Thursday has evolved surprisingly into one of the most
competitive evenings on television. For the past five years,
NBC has owned Thursdays with its lineup beginning with "The
Cosby Show" and ending with "L.A. Law." But ABC has made
inroads.
   And to further illustrate the battle for audience, CBS
Entertainment, a subsidiary of CBS Inc., is considering
moving the CBS News series "48 Hours" from its so-called
protected place on the schedule, Thursdays at 8 p.m., where
it has been for two seasons, according to network officials.
   "48 Hours," anchored by Dan Rather and featuring Bernard
Goldberg and a rotating roster of correspondents, had
consistently finished second behind "The Cosby Show" and "A
Different World" on NBC. But since ABC placed "Father Dowling
Mysteries" last winter, the CBS News series has slipped to
third place.
   According to two network officials, who did not want to be
quoted by name, "48 Hours" may be moved to 10 p.m. on another
night, if it returns as a weekly series.
   The possible move puzzles some at CBS, which just
completed its third consecutive season in the ratings
basement. "48 Hours" was considered protected against "The
Cosby Show" because ratings expectations are so low for any
competitor of the NBC situation comedy.
   But the 1990-91 TV season could be the last for comedian
Bill Cosby and CBS might want to develop an entertainment
show for that time period.
