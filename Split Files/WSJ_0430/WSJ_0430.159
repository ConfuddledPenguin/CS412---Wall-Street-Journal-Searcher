   Gentner Electronics Corp. reported a loss of $241,034, or
eight cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter and said it
expects to report a loss for all of fiscal 1990.
   In the 1989 quarter, the maker of electronic audio
equipment had net income of $179,622, or six cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter ended March 31 declined 3% to $1.47
million from $1.51 million.

   During the quarter, the company said spending on research
and development peaked. The substantial costs in developing
new products and slower-than-expected growth in existing
product sales were primary factors in the quarterly loss, the
company said.
   Three products designed to enhance the company's existing
line of sound equipment for use at FM radio stations and a
new line of telephone products are in the final stages of
development. The company said it expects to begin shipping
those products "in the near future."
   For the nine months, Salt Lake City-based Gentner had a
loss of $274,000, or nine cents a share, compared with
year-earlier net of $333,000, or 11 cents a share. Revenue
increased 14% to $4.1 million from $3.6 million.
