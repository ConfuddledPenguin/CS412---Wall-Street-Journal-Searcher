   In an April 10 editorial-page article "What We Really Know
About the Homeless," Randall K. Filer, a researcher, calls
for more research. It should come as no surprise, then, that
I, a program officer for a major foundation, would call for
more programs.
   Mr. Filer does an excellent and thoroughly readable job of
clarifying what we do and don't know about homelessness. I
too am frustrated by the endless debates over numbers and
causes, particularly as they relate to administration housing
policies. What Mr. Filer fails to do is highlight any of the
positive experiments that are being undertaken to help the
nation solve the problem of homelessness. The Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation and the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) have joined in a multimillion-dollar
national demonstration program that will, we hope, show
cities how they can rescue young homeless families with
complex problems from permanent membership in the underclass.

   As Mr. Filer points out, the members of this group, mostly
single mothers with children under age five, are the most
entitled in America, but they do not get the benefits for
which they are eligible. We believe this is so because the
entitlement system is unnavigable for most anybody, let alone
a teen-age mother with poor skills and a history of mental
illness and/or substance abuse. Also responsible is our
failure to combine housing resources for these families with
health and counseling services they need in order to cope.
   There are many "social entrepreneurs" across the country
trying similar experiments. This is just one of many
promising programs now being undertaken to help the homeless,
and, Mr. Filer will be happy to know, it is one that will be
independently evaluated by researchers at Vanderbilt so that
we can learn more about what works.
