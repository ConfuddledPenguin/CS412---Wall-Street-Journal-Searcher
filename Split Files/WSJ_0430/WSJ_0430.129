   Cineplex Odeon Corp. said it agreed to sell the bulk of
its Virginia theaters to SKS Enterprises Inc. for $18
million, the first of what are expected to be several asset
sales over the coming months.
   The troubled movie theater chain said $17 million of the
proceeds will be used to reduce its bank debt, which at last
report totaled about $620 million.

   Cineplex will get the remaining $1 million in SKS
preferred shares, it said.
   The assets being sold include 80 screens in 18 locations.
Cineplex said it will retain its theaters in the Washington,
D.C., area and nearby Virginia communities.
   Cineplex has promised its bankers to raise $200 million
this year from asset sales to apply against debt.
   The company said the agreement is subject to post-closing
adjustments, which it said aren't expected to be material.
The sale is expected to close May 25, Cineplex said.
