   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Columbia Gas System Inc. said it is
offering for sale its Columbia Gas of New York Inc.
distribution unit. The unit, with annual sales of $65
million, delivers an average of 15 billion cubic feet of gas
a year and serves 67,500 customers.
   The company indicated that, although the unit has been
profitable, resources could "be better devoted to
distribution properties in states where we have a greater
market share."

   The investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. has
been retained to solicit bids, which won't affect any of the
five other Columbia Gas distribution units.
