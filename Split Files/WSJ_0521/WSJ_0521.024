   MELBOURNE -- Elders IXL Ltd. said John Elliott resigned as
chief executive but will remain chairman of the diversified
Australian conglomerate.
   Peter Bartels was named the new chief executive. Mr.
Bartels heads the brewing division of the company, which is
the world's fourth-largest brewer.

   Elders announced in March it plans to sell its natural
resources and financial-services divisions and spin off its
agribusiness operation to become a single-purpose brewer that
will be renamed Foster's Brewing Group Ltd.
   Mr. Elliott had said he planned to step down as chief
executive at some time as part of the corporate
restructuring.
   The decision is seen by analysts as helping distance
Elders from Harlin Holdings Pty. Ltd., a closely held concern
that owns 55% of Elders's shares. Mr. Elliott is a major
shareholder of Harlin.
   Harlin took on a heavy debt load last year when it
acquired its controlling stake in Elders. Stock-market
concerns about Harlin's financial health have depressed
Elders shares in recent weeks.
   A statement from Elders Friday said Alan McGregor, a
director of Elders for 10 years, becomes deputy chairman. Mr.
McGregor has broken his connections with Harlin, the
statement said.
   It said that Ken Jarrett and Geoffrey Lord will retire
from the Elders board later this year. When the changes are
completed early in the fiscal year starting July, the Elders
board will comprise four representatives from Harlin, four
independent directors, and the chief executive.
