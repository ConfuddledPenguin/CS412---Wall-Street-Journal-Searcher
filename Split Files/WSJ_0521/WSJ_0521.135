   Lone Star Industries Inc. said the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority filed suit against the company in
federal court in Massachusetts for $18 million over allegedly
defective concrete crossties.
   The suit stems from MBTA's purchase of about 36,900 ties
that MBTA alleges are defective. The MBTA ties are among
500,000 concrete crossties that Lone Star previously said
were aging prematurely. The ties were manufactured at Lone
Star's SanVel plant in Littleton, Mass.

   Other purchasers of the crossties have also filed suit
against Lone Star, a producer of cement and other
construction materials. Those actions brought in federal
court have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the
U.S. District Court of Maryland.
   Lone Star has sued the suppliers of the cement used for
the crossties and a testing company, which performed work on
the aggregates used in the crossties.
