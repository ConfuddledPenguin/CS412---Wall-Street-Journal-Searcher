   Why aren't interest rates on U.S. government bonds below
5%, just as they were for 88 out of the 90 years before 1967?
   This is the key question facing the administration, the
Federal Reserve, Congress, economists, corporate executives
and civil rights leaders. But low and stable interest rates
seem so remote that the question appears irrelevant.

   Lower interest rates would do more than any government
bailout to restore stability to our financial system. If
mortgage rates dropped to 5% from today's 10.5%, mortgage
payments would fall by more than 40%, making housing more
affordable to all while spurring sales of now-empty
condominiums. Distressed borrowers would have a better chance
of meeting their debt service payments, restoring solvency to
the S&amp;Ls and banks.
   Lower interest rates would provide real debt relief to
developing countries. If interest rates were four percentage
points lower, Mexico's interest payments would be cut three
times more than they will be by this year's restructuring
agreement between Mexico and its creditors. Debt relief would
help restore economic growth in Latin America.
   With lower interest rates, economic growth would
accelerate, and employment would follow. Capital investments
would be easier to finance, improving American
competitiveness. These benefits are especially important for
the least sophisticated and skilled workers, people least
able to cope with an economy whipsawed by high and unstable
interest rates.
   And let's not forget the biggest debtor of them all -- the
U.S. government, which owes the public $2.3 trillion. A four
percentage point reduction in interest rates would reduce
interest payments by more than $90 billion a year, freeing
resources for domestic programs and eliminating any argument
for tax increases.
   What is it that the monetary authorities in the U.S. and
elsewhere used to do to produce low and stable interest rates
for so long that we are no longer doing?
   For most of the 90 years of low interest rates, the U.S.
was on a gold standard. But in 1967, the U.S. began to
abandon its commitment to dollar/gold convertibility. Then
President Nixon closed the "gold window" in 1971. Ever since,
the interest rate on long government bonds has been above 5%.
   The key to the gold standard's success is that it produced
trust in the future buying power of the dollar. When people
exchange goods or services for dollars, they do so trusting
that someone else, in turn, will accept the dollars in
exchange for goods and services. When people lend dollars,
they lend because they trust that they will be repaid in
money that will be exchangeable into goods. The more they
doubt that money will maintain its buying power, the higher
the interest rate they will charge for the loan.
   A gold standard works to produce trust because it provides
a standard by which people can assess whether or not the
monetary authorities are keeping their promise. By contrast,
the efforts by the Fed to "do its best" to fight inflation
with a system based on a plethora of variables simply demands
people's trust, without any criterion to assess Fed
performance. Good intentions do not constitute a promise.
   The gold standard also provides an unambiguous rule of
action. The monetary authorities altered the quantity of
money in order to maintain a stable rate of exchange between
the dollar and gold.
   Beginning in the mid-1980s, several Fed Board members have
spoken of using a basket of commodities as a proxy for the
overall price level. The proposed rule of action was to
maintain the rate of exchange between the dollar and this
index within a band of plus or minus 10%. That suggestion
seems to have been followed. Various commodity indices,
including the CRB Index and Journal of Commerce Index, have
been, with few exceptions, within such a band since early
1987.
   But the Fed has failed to make a public commitment to
maintain this commodity standard. Talk about using commodity
prices to guide actions are one thing. Identifying a
commodity index and specifying the bands to which the Fed is
willing to be held accountable is quite another. Without a
public commitment, people cannot assess what promises, if
any, will be kept. Today, the CRB Index is approaching the
top side of the tacit price band.
   Without an explicit commitment by the Fed to maintain the
buying power of the dollar, doubts over its future grow. The
results are speculative excesses driving interest rates to
and fro, and today's high and costly interest rates.
   Trust in the future value of money will bring interest
rates back down below 5%. The Fed has demonstrated it has the
tools and rules of action to inspire this trust. What is
needed now is the wisdom and leadership to declare and
implement a new commodity standard for the dollar.
