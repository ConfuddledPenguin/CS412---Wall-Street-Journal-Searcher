   IRVING, Texas -- Michaels Stores Inc. is comfortable with
analysts' estimates that it will report net income of about
$450,000, or four cents a share, for the first quarter ended
April 29, said B.B. Tuley, president and chief executive
officer.
   Michaels, an arts and crafts retailer, had net of
$408,000, or four cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The
company previously reported that first-quarter sales rose
27.5% to $71.7 million from $56.2 million.

   Mr. Tuley said Michaels is hopeful that it will report
record earnings this year after a dismal fiscal 1990.
   In fiscal 1990, Michaels had net of $13,000, essentially
breaking even after taking about $4 million in pretax charges
to reflect a failed acquisition. The retailer also added
about $1.5 million to its reserves in case it decides to
close some stores. Sales were $289.8 million.
   Mr. Tuley said Michaels expects to grow 15% to 20% this
year, in part by opening 18 stores. Michaels had 121 stores
at the end of 1989.
   Last year, Michaels agreed to be acquired for $9.50 a
share in cash and $2.50 in new preferred stock by an
investment group that included the Robert M. Bass Group of
Fort Worth, Texas, and Grauer &amp; Wheat Investments Inc. of
Dallas. But the offer fell apart when the group acknowledged
that it couldn't sell the junk bonds to finance the deal. Mr.
Tuley said the company hadn't been looking for a buyer, but
its directors accepted the transaction because it would have
offered a premium over the stock price.
   Now, he says, "we're not for sale."
   This year, Michaels is to open its first stores in Florida
and Mississippi, giving it stores in almost every state in
the southern half of the country.
