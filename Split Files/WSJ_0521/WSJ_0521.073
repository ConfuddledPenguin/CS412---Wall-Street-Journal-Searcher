   One of my companions on a group tour of the Soviet Union
in 1981 was a retired New Jersey optometrist. He was 96 then
and is still alive, I'm told. As a youth, under his original
Russian name, he had participated in the 1905 uprising that
weakened the power of Czar Nicholas II and gave Russian
democracy a precarious -- and unfortunately temporary --
foothold.
   My friend, who prefers anonymity, was the son of the owner
of a small factory that made shoe uppers in Mogilev,
Byelorussia. As a teen-ager, he became involved with a
Bolshevik cell in the plant and soon was serving as a
Bolshevik messenger. At one stop, according to a story
relayed to me by a grandson, my friend told an inquisitive
Georgian waiting with him in an anteroom that he was an
apprentice shoemaker. "Not a tailor?" the man mocked. "If you
are Jewish, you must be a tailor." According to the story --
which seems plausible given the smallness of the Bolshevik
community at that time -- the anti-Semitic inquisitor was
Iosif Dzhugashvili -- Joe Stalin. Stalin's coarseness would
later manifest itself in far broader and crueler ways, of
course.

   "Are you still a Bolshevik?" I asked my elderly
acquaintance. "Yes," he replied with a twinkle. "Did you want
to build communism?" "Nah, all that economic stuff came
later. We just wanted to seize power."
   My friend was long gone from Russia by the time the
Bolsheviks did seize power. After he was questioned by the
czar's police about his role in the 1905 uprising, his
parents feared for his safety and arranged for him to leave
Russia, from where he made his way to the U.S.
   I tell this man's story because his long lifetime
encompasses what might be called the Communist Century. He
was in on the beginnings, when those little Bolshevik cells
were struggling to survive. He watched while Stalin shaped a
police state and expanded it into an empire. The contagion
spread to China, North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia,
Angola, Afghanistan, until nearly a third of the world's
population was under the control of communist regimes.
   Now, we are seeing communism's decline -- in Africa,
Central America, Eastern Europe, Afghanistan -- with the
possibility that the central domino, the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union, will collapse as well. If so, communism at
its core will have come full circle in less than a century.
   One might say that communism already is dead as an
ideology. It is most disliked by peoples who have experienced
it and have learned from bitter experience that Communist
parties do not deliver what they promise: social equality.
Soviet communism went into decline after its inherent
hypocrisy became widely evident. "All power to the people"
was in fact a slogan under which a privileged elite, through
state control of all property, could exercise absolute power
over the people. The Soviets could export communism to Third
World countries mainly because its powerful instruments for
political control were attractive to would-be despots. In the
name of class struggle, Communist parties simply created what
Yugoslavia's Milovan Djilas in 1957 called "The New Class."
   There may be some ratio between how openly Communists
enjoy the fruits of their power and how long they retain it.
Nicaragua's Sandinistas, who displayed a taste for big cars
and haciendas immediately after seizing control in 1980, are
out after only a decade. By contrast, Ho Chi Minh's heirs,
with their ascetic image, may hang on to power for years yet,
despite their murderous ways and the hash they have made of
Vietnam's economy.
   There could be a lesson here: Political leaders who
espouse an ideology better live up to it. The U.S., for
example, espouses democracy and the rule of law. So it is
always worth asking whether its democratic and legal
institutions (Congress and the courts) are functioning as
they should.
   But the fact that Communist parties are being discredited
all over the world does not mean that the more fundamental
force that gave them their initial appeal has been banished
as well. That force is class warfare. It is as old as
history. Plutarch took note of the dangerous "disparity of
fortune between the rich and the poor." Jacob Bronowski, the
late cultural historian who wrote and narrated the brilliant
1974 BBC TV series "The Ascent of Man," sometimes interpreted
history in terms of the have-nots seeking to share the wealth
of the haves. Karl Marx, the inspiration for Lenin, wove
together long treatises in justification of class struggle.
Long after the word "communism" has been laid to rest, class
struggle will still exist and play a part, large or small, in
the politics of all nations.
   History has some lessons about that as well, however.
Those dangerous tendencies in Athens that Plutarch wrote
about were addressed by a remarkable peaceful revolution
conducted by Solon after he was chosen to become the
city-state's leader, or hon, in 594 B.C. He gave Athens a new
system of laws, popular courts and a good measure of
representative democracy.
   Solon proved that when citizens believe that laws are by
and large fair and that they individually are represented in
the government bodies that make and administer laws, the
forces for class struggle are much diminished. Class-warfare
rhetoric is uttered daily in the political arenas of the
West, but so long as no significant class can genuinely say
that it is denied a share of political influence or legal
redress, such appeals will not inspire large-scale resorts to
violence. In that sense, the Western democracies seem to be
in reasonably good health as the 20th century draws toward a
close.
   The nations of Europe that have recently shed communism
are emulating the West by drafting new constitutions and
creating democratic institutions. People in those countries
are most conscious of Solon's lesson because they have
experienced systems that lacked a rule of law and political
representation for a broad populace. Because of the popular
will for change, we may find that Poland, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and the Baltic States will make
a far more rapid transition to democracy than we now imagine.
And who knows, maybe Russia too.
   But that effort will be tested at every turn by those who
would seek to gain and hold power by pitting class against
class, race against race, ethnic group against ethnic group.
Europe, the U.S. and Japan will be tested by how much and how
intelligently they support the transition process. Emerging
leaders already are asking whether Western governments really
believe and practice their ideology or only offer slogans.
   My elderly friend was in on the beginning of an exciting
political change that turned out badly for Russia, something
he might have predicted had he known that a racist Stalin
would ultimately seize power. But now that communism is in
decline, there may be a chance for setting things right, if
the right lessons have been learned.
