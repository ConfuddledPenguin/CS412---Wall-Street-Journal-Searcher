   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Scot M. Spencer, a controversial figure
in the demise of Braniff last fall, was arrested here last
week at -- of all things -- a bankruptcy auction of the
defunct airline's assets.
   Mr. Spencer, the subject of a Wall Street Journal page-one
article in November, was arrested Thursday morning on a
charge stemming from his alleged failure to return a rental
car in 1987. He posted a $1,000 bond and was released that
afternoon. The charge is a third-degree felony, Tampa, Fla.,
police said.

   Mr. Spencer, 25 years old, is chief operating officer of
BN Air Inc., a company formed by some of Braniff's former
owners to rebuild the airline.
   He couldn't be reached, but he said in a statement, "This
is a minor matter. The rental car company has confirmed that
the car had been returned. An attorney has been working on
this misunderstanding and is in the process of resolving this
matter." A BN Air spokeswoman said Mr. Spencer informed her
that he wasn't arrested, but that he has posted an appearance
bond.
   However, Orange County, Fla., police officials confirmed
that Mr. Spencer was, in fact, arrested on a two-year-old
outstanding warrant from nearby Tampa, where he was charged
in connection with allegedly failing to return a car he
rented from Hertz Corp. at Tampa International Airport in
late 1987. The rental car contract shows that a blue,
four-door Cadillac Seville was rented to "M. Spencer" and was
to be paid by "Boeing Company." Later, Boeing Co., a
Seattle-based aircraft maker, told Hertz that it didn't have
an employee by that name, according to Hertz records. The car
was found abandoned in 1988 in a Hertz Miami lot shortly
after police had contacted Mr. Spencer's family, according to
Tampa police records.
