   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it will temporarily
idle its Atlanta assembly plant next week for one week
because of slow dealer orders for the Ford Taurus and Mercury
Sable cars built there.
   The move will affect about 2,500 hourly workers on the
plant's two shifts, and it will cut Taurus and Sable
production by about 5,000 cars. Ford's decision to idle the
Atlanta plant follows the one-week idling this week of its
Chicago plant, which also builds the midsized Taurus and
Sable. Ford also blamed the Chicago plant move on a shortage
of dealer orders.
