   Faced with the threat of continued spending cuts by
tobacco and alcohol advertisers, the outdoor ad business is
stepping up efforts to lure packaged-goods marketers and
other nontraditional billboard advertisers.
   Next month, Gannett Co.'s outdoor ad division will begin a
tour through many big ad agencies pitching the value of
outdoor advertising. The program, called "Creative
Challenge," will target agency executives with an elaborate
pitch concluding that outdoor is among the most powerful and
effective ad mediums.

   It won't be an easy sell. Outdoor advertising has never
been the medium of choice among ad executives, in large part
because of a lack of data available tracking its
effectiveness. "Outdoor gets resistance from any advertiser
who's very precise about measurable impact," says Joanne M.
Davis, president of ad agency Omon. "And in media and
creative departments, it doesn't have the glamour that
television and magazines do."
   But outdoor ad executives argue they can't afford to sit
back and watch their major ad categories post further
declines. The Institute of Outdoor Advertising is expected to
report today that tobacco advertising dropped to just 12.5%
of total outdoor advertising in 1989, down from 25.3% in
1988. However, the 1989 figures were calculated with a new
accounting system, and the institute claims figures in
previous years were overstated.
   The decline, however, isn't doing much to appease tobacco
industry foes. They criticize the ubiquity of outdoor
cigarette ads in low income, inner-city neighborhoods, where
the industry's most dedicated consumers reside. And they
assert that tobacco companies will continue to heavily target
those smokers, for whom billboards remain the strongest form
of advertising.
   The institute says overall revenue for 1989 rose to $1.6
billion from $1.4 billion in 1988, buoyed in large part by
increases in the entertainment and publishing ad categories.
Strong gains were also made in healthcare and apparel.
   Gannett and many of its competitors, including Patrick
Media Group and Naegele Outdoor Advertising, remain
optimistic about signing advertisers in new categories such
as insurance and food products. The companies base much of
their pitch on the relative inexpensiveness of outdoor
advertising.
   Don Davidson, president and chief executive at Gannett
Outdoor, says that his firm has already been successful in
signing up a number of packaged-goods marketers, including
Procter &amp; Gamble, Clorox, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive.
   `That's where we think we're going to enjoy significant
increases in business in the future," Mr. Davidson says.
   But it's not clear whether those companies are committed
to spend enough to offset the losses incurred at the top.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, for one, says it signed on with Gannett
to advertise only one product, Tide With Bleach. "A couple of
our other brands are looking at using it on a very limited
basis, but we haven't really used outdoor much at all," a
spokeswoman says. "It's not even a measurable percentage."
   P&amp;G says it isn't satisfied that outdoor advertising is as
effective as other media in selling its brands. "It's very
hard to measure the effectiveness of outdoor," the spokesman
says. "There's not a lot of good research" pointing to the
measurablity of outdoor advertising.
   Both Patrick Media and Gannett are well aware of that
sentiment. "It is our goal over the next couple of years to
develop some definitive effectiveness research that will make
them feel more comfortable," Mr. Davidson says.
   In its presentation to agencies, Gannett plans to push its
Conquest ad measurement system, which helps advertisers get a
better handle on the number of people who see particular
billboards. Gannett says the Conquest system allows it to
target billboards so they run in neighborhoods where brands
are especially hot sellers.
   "We could spend a lot of time wringing our hands or we
could try to understand" where to go from here, says Ron
Pancratz, vice president of sales and marketing at Patrick
Media. He says Patrick Media plans to take the message to
advertisers that a tobacco cutback represents an opening up
of some prime billboard space that was previously locked up.
"We see that as an opportunity," he says.
   Other major outdoor companies are looking to fill the void
by signing local advertisers. Randall Swaney, who is general
manager of Naegele Outdoor Advertising's Memphis market, says
he plans to go after car dealerships and banks, the big
clients before tobacco advertisers became the major spenders.
"This really means getting back to the basics and educating
these people as to why they should be buying outdoor," he
says.

   Lintas to Merge Agencies
                                                                                                       

   Lintas said it plans to merge its recently acquired Hawley
Martin Partners agency with its much larger Fahlgren &amp; Swink
ad unit.

currently chairman of Hawley Martin, of Richmond, Va. Lintas
said it will rename the shop Fahlgren Martin. Lintas is an
Interpublic Group agency.
   Smoot Fahlgren will continue in his role as chief
executive of the agency, based in Atlanta. Fahlgren &amp; Swink,
which has billings of $157 million, has clients including
Cincinnati Bell and Southern Co.

   Corrections &amp; Amplifications
                                                                                                       

   DAVID N. MARTIN agreed in principle to become chairman of
Fahlgren &amp; Swink, a Parkersburg, W. Va.-based ad unit of
Lintas:USA. He will continue as chairman of Hawley Martin
Partners, which last week agreed to be acquired by Lintas.
Yesterday's advertising column incorrectly reported that
Hawley Martin and Fahlgren &amp; Swink were merging and misstated
the headquarters for Fahlgren &amp; Swink. The story also
incorrectly identified Cincinnati Bell as a client of
Fahlgren &amp; Swink.
