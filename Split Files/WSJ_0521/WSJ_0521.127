   Synergen Inc. said that Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. plans to
discontinue support for Synergen's research program to
determine if its interlukin-1 receptor antagonist is a
potential treatment for inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis.
   Synergen, a Boulder, Colo., biotechnology concern, said
that payments from the U.S. unit of Switzerland's F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co accounted for 64% of its sponsored
research and development revenue of $11.9 million last year
and 61% of the $2 million it received in sponsored R&amp;D during
the first quarter this year. But Synergen said it doesn't
expect Roche's termination of support to hurt its development
schedule for the product.

   Synergen said it hopes to file with the Food and Drug
Administration later this year so that it can begin human
clinical trials with the protein, known as IL-1ra.
