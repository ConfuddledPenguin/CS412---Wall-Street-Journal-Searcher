   As I read the excerpt from Bette Bao Lord's book
"Legacies: A Chinese Mosaic" (editorial page, April 20), I
couldn't help wonder why the U.S. government -- and even
worse, the people of the U.S. -- continues to ignore the
oppression of human rights occurring in China. During the
Tiananmen Square incident, America rallied for the students
who craved a democratic society and protested the bloody
massacre that occurred afterward. It was obvious that as
journalists were expelled from the country and stories
stopped making the headlines, our concerns for the Chinese
people seemed to dwindle.
   We criticize countries for depriving their citizens
freedom of the press, stating they have a right to know what
is going on in the world. It is true that the nightly news
and newspaper media are a source of this information, but
should they have such an enormous control over such an
idealistic society as our own? One week it's China, the next
South Africa. And then the next week it's Lithuania. Let's
not lose sight of the fact that after the headlines are gone,
the problems still remain.
