   Seven years after the onset of the school reform movement,
public education in America is no less a subject of concern
that it was on the day in 1983 when the report "A Nation At
Risk" was released.
   Now, attention is turning to the need for massive
restructuring that, in part, would reorganize schools into
smaller units and delegate decision making to those at
individual school buildings. In addition, some reformers
advocate a shakeup in the curriculum in terms of what is
taught and how it is taught.

   Restructuring is necessary, but it is still not a
solution. America is fooling itself if it thinks that public
education will get better without addressing some of the
major value-laden obstacles to improvement. Here are three:
   1) Students must come to appreciate that learning takes
hard work.
   Most American students do not work very hard and, as a
result, do not learn nearly as much as they could. Minimal
effort is the rule. In "The Shopping Mall High School," a
study of the nation's secondary schools, the authors said
that a kind of tacit treaty exists in the schools. It is
understood that teachers will not demand much of students if
students, in turn, do not hassle the teachers.
   I have been in countless classrooms in urban high schools
where the level of work was embarrassingly easy, essentially
on the level of a suburban elementary school. On the other
hand, college-preparatory courses in suburban high schools
are often watered down to accommodate students' desires, and
some elective courses lack rigor altogether. Grade inflation
exacerbates self-delusion.
   What is missing from the experience of many students is
any sense of intellectual struggle, any recognition that true
learning may require delayed gratification. There is
disregard for high expectations because that would mean long
hours of concentrated reading, some grueling memorization and
one revision after another to perfect a theme paper.
   Much has been written about Asian-Americans who exceed
other Americans in scholastic achievement. Asian-Americans,
in general, work harder. It has been documented, for
instance, that they devote more time to homework. In San
Francisco, a study found that Asian-Americans did 46% more
homework than white students and 85% more than black
students.
   Some teachers have stopped assigning homework because
students won't do it. More than one of five 11th graders
responded in a survey by the National Assessment of
Educational Progress that they did no homework. Questions of
homework's worth aside, this is a commentary on the work
ethic of students.
   Such subjects as mathematics and science, which require
particular diligence, are unattractive to students. Physics
is studied by only 31.7% of those on the academic track and
by fewer than 1% on the nonacademic track. By the time they
reach college, only 1.5% of undergraduates have the
preparation and the patience to major in mathematics.
   The reform movement, while adding course requirements, has
too often failed to make demands on students. The extra years
of English, math, social studies and science tend to consist
of basic or general or remedial courses, not advanced work,
according to a study by the Center for Policy Research in
Education at Rutgers University. It is no accident that so
few students attain levels of sophisticated thinking in
subject after subject that is examined by the National
Assessment.
   School reform is discussed in terms of its role in making
America economically competitive. It should be clear to
anyone who has read about the work habits of students and
employees in Japan that it will take more than school
restructuring to make American students competitive.
   2) Schools must be communities within which scholastic
achievement is valued.
   Creating a proper climate for teaching and learning should
be a prerequisite to all else that takes place in school
building. The learning community is imperiled when students
are fearful or anxious, when peer pressure denigrates
scholarship, when there is divisiveness or when students do
not feel a sense of belonging.
   Misconduct poisons the atmosphere in some schools, and
violence in the cities has gotten so bad that traveling to
and from school has become a journey through a war zone.
Chicago is considering installing school rooms at housing
projects so that students do not have to make the dangerous
trip to school and New York has started to provide special
guarded subway cars for students.
   Not enough is said about the pressures that impede
schoolwork and undermine the goals of education. Sports,
clothes, cars -- all are taken more seriously than schoolwork
by many students. Many who do not really need the money work
part-time jobs because they want disposable income. By 12th
grade, 66% of students hold jobs; those who work more than 20
hours a week have the lowest academic performance. For
impoverished students, who need the income, there is the
battle to resist the lure of the drug trade. What motivation
is there for academic perseverance when riches are available?
   Dropout prevention efforts are frequently misdirected,
seeking to hold students in an atmosphere where education is
not valued. If young people remain in school -- at least at
the high schools with the highest dropout rates -- they are
still in settings counterproductive to good education, taking
insubstantial courses that prepare them for little.
   School reform will barely matter if the values shaping the
school culture are left untouched. Self-discipline and inner
controls must be cultivated in young people if they are to be
engaged in learning of intellectual consequence. Schools must
be sanctuaries, where education is valued. This is no easy
task, especially in the inner city, given the influence of
neighborhood culture on values in the school.
   Everything that happens in school must be testimony to the
importance of learning and attempts must be made to extend
the support network for this attitude beyond the walls of the
school, to the places where children spend most of their
time.
   This does not mean that learning can never be enjoyable or
that there is no role in schools for athletics and
extracurricular activities. But the primacy of the learning
community must be stressed above all and steps taken to get
young people to want to share the values of that community.
For masses of students, there will be no learning until this
happens.
   3) Parents must reinforce the schooling of their children.
   Students don't just appear at school out of nowhere and
then fade into nothingness each afternoon. They almost always
live in homes with at least one adult. Those adults have more
impact -- positively or negatively -- on a child's scholastic
achievement than some observers seem willing to acknowledge.
There is a tendency to act as if schools and social agencies
can take up the slack, but such an approach seldom succeeds
in the long run and no one yet has found a sure-fire antidote
for the problem of parents ill-equipped for parenthood.
   School reform can go just so far in filling the void
created by mothers and fathers who fail to provide the
foundation and the reinforcement that children need for
school. Just one example of what the schools confront can be
seen in statistics showing that second-year algebra is taken
in high school by 27.3% of students whose parents were not
high school graduates, 41.7% whose parents completed high
school and went no further, and 65.7% of students whose
parents attended college.
   The home has an enormous impact on children as learners.
It is not essential that parents be well educated themselves
in order to set up circumstances that will help their
children succeed in school. In fact, many readers of this
article are the offspring of parents of modest education.
Values in the home and in the neighborhood can do much to
give students a positive attitude about school.
   Some notable efforts are now under way around the country
to try to bond parents to schools and to train them in the
ways that will abet the schooling of their children. Let's
hope that these attempts work, because most of what is
happening under the aegis of school reform is otherwise in
jeopardy of failure.
