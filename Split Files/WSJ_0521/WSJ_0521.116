   EnviroSource Inc. said it has decided not to initiate
negotiations in connection with a tax-free stock-swap
transaction involving Envirosafe Services Inc.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
EnviroSource, which holds a 62.5% stake in Envirosafe, said
it made the decision due to "market conditions and other
factors."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   EnviroSource had planned to seek such a transaction last
January.
   Envirosafe is based in King of Prussia, Pa., and
EnviroSource is based in Stamford, Conn.
