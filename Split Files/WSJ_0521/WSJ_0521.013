   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson &amp; Johnson has spent more
than a century selling health-care products to consumers --
to make money. It has spent 11 years selling healthful living
to its own employees -- to save money.
   Cost containment has been a major goal of its wellness
program since day oneand that goal has apparently been met.
Johnson &amp; Johnson says that last year the program saved $378
per employee by lowering absenteeism and by slowing the rise
in the company's health-care expenses. The cost of the
program, which offers checkups and encourages healthier
eating and exercise habits, is $200 per employee.

   J&amp;J is one of only a handful of companies that have made
comprehensive examinations of the costs and benefits of their
programs. It is precisely because of this lack of hard data
that many other corporate wellness programs are vulnerable to
cost-cutting pressure, one expert says. "In a rough economic
climate, one of the first things that is cut is a health
program or a wellness program," says Roger Reed, who
supervises wellness programs for Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Indiana. "The reason is a lot of wellness-program
administrators haven't done a good job of documenting the
results."
   That hasn't been the case with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Its
study took three years and involved 8,000 employees. Wellness
was tested just as the company would experiment with a new
drug, with both a test group and a control group.
   The company tracked medical costs and productivity of
5,000 workers at three subsidiaries whose executives were
willing to give it a try. The control group consisted of
other units that didn't have such a program. During the first
year, the wellness program cost more than it saved. In the
second year, it broke even. And in the third year, it saved
enough money to pay back the losses during the first year.
   Health-care costs at Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is
self-insured, have risen about 310% over the past decade. But
these same costs spurted an estimated 460% at 30 similar
companies that J&amp;J tracks to determine its own wage and
compensation levels. Last year, J&amp;J says, it spent $93.5
million on medical costs, up 10% from 1988. That compared
with a 20% rise at the other 30 concerns.
   The wellness program has been enough of a success that J&amp;J
began marketing it to other companies four years ago. So far,
Johnson &amp; Johnson Health Management Inc. is providing varying
levels of service to about 60 companies with a total of more
than 850,000 employees.
   Outside experts generally give high marks to Johnson &amp;
Johnson's internal program, but some criticize the emphasis
on cost containment. Edward J. Bernacki, vice president of
Tenneco Inc., which has an aggressive wellness program of its
own, agrees that wellness programs save money over the long
run, but he contends that such a saving shouldn't be the
primary reason for starting one. "I think it kind of cheapens
a program," says Mr. Bernacki, "to say we're doing it because
there's a gain in it for the company."
   At Johnson &amp; Johnson's headquarters here, employees can
work out in a first-floor gym, select "healthy heart" foods
in the cafeteria, and check their weight in restrooms. They
are even encouraged to drop hints to fellow workers about
losing weight or giving up smoking.
   "We've developed an environment where it's OK for a worker
to say, `John, you're putting on a few pounds,'" says John S.
Brown, J&amp;J's vice president of employee relations. Mr. Brown
should know, because he just shed 40 pounds on a diet and, in
turn, has been nagging his secretary to quit smoking.
   Do employees not participating in the program feel
pressured by such nagging? Anthony A. Herrmann, Johnson &amp;
Johnson's vice president of health, safety and environmental
affairs, suspects there may have been some resentment about
the approach, especially in the beginning. But he says it has
never been a big issue and there hasn't been a "hue or cry."
   Lewis Maltby, who heads the American Civil Liberties
Union's task force on work place civil liberties, lauded
Johnson &amp; Johnson for having a wellness program, but he took
issue with the practice of encouraging employees to drop
hints. "There is a danger that you'll go from helping people
do something they want to do into coercing people," he says.
   The goals of the program are pretty basic: Stop smoking,
eat more fruit and fewer fatty foods, get some exercise, and
buckle up your seatbelt.
   "The way you change the health of the whole population is
to get the whole population to make small changes in a lot of
areas," says Curtis S. Wilbur, a Johnson &amp; Johnson executive
who helped write a study on the wellness program.
   The program, called Live for Life, is voluntary. Employees
joining the program receive a 19-page questionnaire, part of
a health-risks profile. They must ponder such questions as
these:
   How many times a week do you add salt to your food?
   How many flights of stairs do you climb a day?
   Have people ever annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
   How many close friends do you have? (The question on close
friends is part of a section examining the employee's mental
health. If responses to several of these questions indicate
the person is suffering from depression, he or she might be
referred for further counseling.)
   The completed questionnaire is immediately analyzed by
computer, which prints out a response that points out areas
where employees may not have healthy habits.
   A nurse practitioner then goes over the results of the
survey with the employees, takes their blood pressure and
tests their pulse while they ride an exercise bicycle.
   The questionnaire and the session with the nurse can
produce big results in themselves. "That kind of face-to-face
education is maybe the most important part of Live for Life,"
says David Calkins, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical
School, who has done research on health promotion. In fact, a
Johnson &amp; Johnson study found that employees got about half
the benefits of the wellness program just by going through
the health-risks profile.
   After the profile, Live for Life tries to persuade
employees to act: to exercise, watch their diets and lose
weight; to quit smoking; or to do whatever else might be
called for. Signs in hallways and brochures sent to employees
promote various programs, and workers win prizes for
participating. Employees are asked to stop in for follow-up
health-risks profiles.
   The information garnered from the questionnaire is
confidential between the employee and the company's medical
department. "I think the levels of participation would not be
anywhere as high if we had not paid attention to this issue
of confidentiality," says Dr. Herrmann.
   Live for Life now is available to all 35,000 J&amp;J employees
in the U.S. At headquarters here, nearly two-thirds of the
workers participate to some degree. The average employee, for
instance, exercises in the gym nearly twice a week.
   Some have no desire to participate. "I eat what I want. I
eat as much as I want, and my weight stays the same," says
Herbert Brown, the 56-year-old security supervisor, as he
polishes off a plate of bacon and eggs in the company
cafeteria. And, come lunchtime, there are plenty of employees
ordering cheeseburgers.
   Those cheeseburgers have had their effect. During the
company's three-year study, the average employee with access
to the wellness program lost only about a pound more than
other workers. The results are typical of most
weight-reduction programs, health experts say. It's not that
tough to get people to lose weight, but it's very hard to
keep them from putting the pounds back on.
   Smoking, however, is a different story. Slightly less than
20% of J&amp;J employees currently smoke, down from about 30% in
the late 1970s. "If you can get people to stop smoking, you
make a big hit in a variety of risk factors," says Frank H.
Barker, a vice president.
   The problem is that the people who still smoke are
hard-core, committed puffers. The company is taking the next
step by making its corporate headquarters completely
smoke-free on Oct. 1. Some of its subsidiaries have already
made such a move.
   Finally, J&amp;J has begun combing its data base to identify
employees with the highest risk factors, such as smoking,
high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. The
strategy: concentrate more resources on the minority of
people who are likely to account for the majority of
health-care costs.
