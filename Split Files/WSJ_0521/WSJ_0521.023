   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing a
recent weakening in Wisconsin Power &amp; Light Co.'s credit
ratios, said it placed the utility's long-term debt and
preferred stock of about $400 million under review for
potential downgrade.
   The rating concern said the utility's credit measures
"have come under pressure as a result of lower allowed
returns by regulators, federal tax law changes, and
increasing construction requirements."

   Moody's said its review will focus on "the extent to which
WP&amp;L's current and prospective measures of debt protection
are sufficient to support {Moody's} highest rating,
especially in view of growing business and operating risks in
the electric utility industry."
   Under review are the triple-A rating on the company's
first mortgage and secured pollution control revenue bonds,
and the double-A-1 rating on its preferred stock. Wisconsin
Power's Prime-1 rating on its commercial paper isn't under
review.
   A Wisconsin Power spokesman said Moody's announcement of a
review "wasn't unexpected," and added that the company, "
would expect, based on what Moody's release said today, that
we will see a down rating occur." He noted that much of
Moody's comments were concerned "with the state of the
industry," as opposed to the company in particular.
