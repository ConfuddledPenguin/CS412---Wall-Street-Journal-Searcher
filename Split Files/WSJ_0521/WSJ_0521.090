   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- The management shake-up at
N.V. Philips continues as Jan Timmer promoted two PolyGram
N.V. officers Friday to fill the vacancy created by his
departure in July to assume the post of president of Philips.
   Filling Mr. Timmer's vacancy at PolyGram as chairman of
the supervisory board will be David Fine. Mr. Fine, currently
president and chief executive officer of PolyGram, will
assume his new post at the end of 1990. Mr. Fine has been
president and chief executive officer of PolyGram since 1987.

   Alain Levy, currently an executive vicepresident with
responsibility for popular music and music publishing in
France and the U.S., will assume Mr. Fine's position as
president and chief executive officer at PolyGram, which is
80%-owned by Philips.
   Mr. Levy, who has been with PolyGram since 1984, oversaw
PolyGram's recent acquisitions of A&amp;M Records and Island
Records in the U.S.
   The two promotions are the latest developments in the
management shake-up of the Dutch electronics group following
Cornelius Van Der Klugt's announcement earlier this month
that he would resign as president of Philips in July 1990, a
year earlier than expected.
