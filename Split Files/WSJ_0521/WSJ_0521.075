   California legislators, staring at a huge projected budget
shortfall, are studying ways to curb growth in state
spending.
   Gov. George Deukmejian admitted last week that California
faces a $3.6 billion budget deficit for its fiscal year
beginning July 1. The Republican governor blamed the
projected deficit on disappointing tax collections and
existing social programs that push up costs faster than the
state can pay for them.

   While state officials haven't ruled out the imposition of
new taxes, they plan to use the coming weeks to hash out
possible cuts in spending.
   The rude fiscal awakening comes at a time when
California's economy "is slowing down, but is still
outperforming the rest of the country," said Jesse Huff, the
state's finance director.
   Mr. Huff said that despite the loss of defense jobs,
growth in employment should exceed 2.5% in the next fiscal
year -- or better than the rate of the state's population
growth.
   In fact, state economists expect California's tax revenue
to increase by 7% in the coming fiscal year. The problem,
however, is that expenditures are rising far more than
revenue growth -- at an 11% clip. That's mainly because the
state runs numerous open-ended "entitlement" programs and has
seen an unexpected rise in its school-age population.
   "Expenditure patterns are going to have to be realigned to
match revenue patterns," said Mr. Huff.
   Just how that will be accomplished isn't clear.
California's state budget has nearly doubled since 1983, and
state Democrats appear ready to resist Gov. Deukmejian's idea
that the only way to close the budget gap is to suspend
automatic annual increases in social welfare and aid to the
blind, aged and disabled.
   Gov. Deukmejian also wants to shore up the state's reserve
fund, which after beginning the year at $1.1 billion, is
expected to total a mere $86 million at the close of the
current fiscal year. His target for a reserve is $1.3
billion, about 3% of next year's spending, which is likely to
exceed this year's $50 billion budget. Such a reserve is
needed, the governor argues, in order to pay for emergencies
such as last October's earthquake in northern California.
   Complicating the debate over how best to accommodate
fiscal realities are fears that California's economy may
weaken in the months ahead. "I don't see the state's economy
being as strong as {others} think it will be," said Thomas
Burns, staff director for the Democratic-controlled
legislature's budget office. "I think the deficit may get
worse before it gets better."
   Indeed, state officials seem to be finding it increasingly
difficult to predict revenue, which largely comes from a
combination of personal income and sales taxes. Last week's
deficit projection was the fourth unsettling budget forecast
in as many years, making fiscal planning a dicey affair in
California.
   For whatever the reasons, said Mr. Huff, "these days there
seems to be a high degree of volatility in tax collections
here."
