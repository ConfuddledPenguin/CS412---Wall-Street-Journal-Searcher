   Opening arguments in the case of a former Mobil Corp.
executive who claims he was fired because he refused to cover
up environmental problems are expected to begin today in
federal court in Newark, N.J.
   Valcar Bowman, Jr., former manager for environmental
affairs at the company's Mobil Chemical Co. unit, says he was
fired in 1986 because he refused to make changes in internal
environmental reports about the company's operating
facilities. Mr. Bowman claims the changes would have
downplayed environmental problems. Companies are encouraged
by regulators to keep the records to help ensure compliance
with environmental laws.

   The reports are at the heart of Mr. Bowman's case. In a
pretrial ruling, U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman said,
"The defendant itself recognized that potential liability
would accrue to these reports, which is why {Mobil's general
counsel's office} took pains to ensure that they did not
overstate the extent of noncompliance."
   Mobil contends the proposed changes in the reports were
designed to improve accuracy and clarity and that no cover-up
of environmental problems occurred. The company has said Mr.
Bowman lost his job as part of a cost-cutting move. Lawyers
for both sides said they couldn't comment on pending
litigation.
   Mobil initially opposed releasing the documents to the
public, arguing it might discourage candor by companies that
keep such records. Judge Ackerman ruled in December that the
public had a right to see Mobil's reports.
   Mr. Bowman says he was criticized during a 1985
performance review for refusing to allow his staff to
participate in the removal of environmental documents from a
Mobil plant in Bakersfield, Calif. Mr. Bowman said he and his
staff were ordered to remove the documents shortly after the
Los Angeles district attorney's office raided another Mobil
facility and seized environmental documents.
   Three members of Mr. Bowman's staff who prepared the
reports have stated in pretrial fact-finding interviews that
they don't believe the proposed changes would have falsified
the findings. They are expected to testify for Mobil at the
trial. Others expected to testify for the New York company
include Mr. Bowman's supervisor, the former president of
Mobil Chemical and several in-house lawyers.
   Mobil is seeking permission from the court to introduce
evidence showing Mr. Bowman's alleged misrepresentations
involving his military history, academic references and
resumes. In court papers submitted late last month, Mobil
said Mr. Bowman antagonized his colleagues and became an
ineffective manager.

   EASTERN AIRLINE'S legal bill is $12.7 million for four
months.
   Nine law firms representing Eastern, its creditors and the
court-appointed examiner in the airline's Chapter 11
reorganization won approval last week for the payment of $7.8
million in fees for the four months prior to Feb. 28, a
period that included the conclusion of a controversial
inquiry into the acquisition of Eastern's assets by its
parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Five other law firms had sought almost $4.9 million from
Eastern's estate, but under a compromise with creditors,
those firms will have to seek as much as 65% of their fees
from Texas Air. The creditors had objected that much of the
five firms' work benefited Texas Air during the examiner's
investigation.
   The examiner, David I. Shapiro, concluded his
investigation March 1 with a report that Texas Air had
underpaid Eastern by as much as $403 million for assets it
acquired from the unit prior to Eastern's Chapter 11 filing
in March 1989.
   The five firms that will have to seek some of their fees
from Texas Air were led by Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld,
which claimed almost $3.3 million in compensation.
   The Washington, D.C., firm was replaced last week as
Eastern's counsel for labor and government regulatory matters
at the request of trustee Martin Shugrue, who was appointed
in April to run the airline. Eastern's new regulatory counsel
is Washington-based Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &amp;
Hand, which worked with Mr. Shugrue when he was with Pan Am
carrier, Continental Airlines.
   Mr. Shugrue isn't expected to change Eastern's lead
bankruptcy firm, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, which billed $3.1
million for the latest billing period. But Verner Liipfert
won't be the only new law firm in the 14-month-old Eastern
reorganization. Los Angeles-based O'Melveny &amp; Myers recently
wooed creditors' committee counsel Joel Zweibel from the New
York firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel, where
Mr. Zweibel had been a partner for more than eight years.
   Mr. Zweibel is taking the Eastern creditors' work with him
to O'Melveny's New York office. He is bringing along with him
clients in the Chapter 11 reorganizations of LTV Corp. and
Lomas Financial Corp. Part of the reason for his move, Mr.
Zweibel said, is the availability of more staff at his new
firm.
   Kramer Levin billed just $930,478 for the fourth period in
Eastern's bankruptcy. "We've staffed unusually leanly," Mr.
Zweibel said.

   DISASTER CASES would be streamlined under pending federal
legislation.
   The bill, introduced by U.S. Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D.,
Wis.), provides for easier consolidation of state and federal
disaster-related cases under the jurisdiction of one federal
court. Such streamlining is aimed at easing the burden on
courts nationwide by eliminating the duplication of cases and
speeding up the disposition of those cases.
   Under current law, cases filed in state court can be moved
to a federal court only if none of the defendants are
residents of the same state as any of the plaintiffs. In the
avalanche of suits typically filed in the wake of a disaster,
there is a big chance that several parties will reside in the
same state, thereby hindering consolidation.
   Under the proposed law, state cases can be moved if any
single defendant and any plaintiff are from different states.
Once the request for consolidation is made, the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, a group of seven federal
judges, determines which federal judge will handle the case.
   The proposed legislation defines a disaster as any
accident in which at least 25 persons died or were injured
and in which damages amount to more than $50,000 for each
person. It doesn't cover product-liability cases such as the
asbestos-litigation or the Agent Orange cases. The bill is
awaiting action on the House floor, following the unanimous
approval of the House Judiciary Committee.
   Some plaintiffs' attorneys oppose the bill, claiming that
consumers get a better deal under the current system in which
they can go "forum-shopping," that is, choose whichever court
-- state or federal -- best suits their needs.
   Others, including San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli, are
more bullish. Mr. Belli says, "Anything that cuts down the
waiting time and helps to get rid of the multiplicity of
courts and cases is important. This is the direction we
should be working toward in the 1990s."

   LAWYERS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY SATISFIED with their job
choices.
   A survey, conducted by the National Law Journal and West
Publishing Co., of St. Paul, Minn., found that most lawyers
aren't secretly yearning to become stockbrokers or
songwriters. Of the more than 1,000 lawyers polled, 79% said
they are satisfied with their career and would choose to
become a lawyer again.
   But for women and blacks the decision wouldn't be as easy.
Approximately 15% of women and nearly a third of black
lawyers surveyed said they plan to leave the profession.
   Most of the happy lawyers cited intellectual stimulation
and not financial rewards as the primary reason for their job
satisfaction. But among lawyers with annual incomes between
$200,000 and $400,000, 77% cited money as key to their
contentment.

   GRETA GARBO'S ESTATE sues Simon &amp; Schuster to halt
publication of biography.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, N.Y.,
claims the book is being falsely promoted and violates the
estate's copyrights. It claims that "Garbo: Her Story," by
Antoni Gronowicz, is being misrepresented as a factual
account based on the author's 20-year friendship with the
actress, who died in April.
   The suit cites affidavits by Ms. Garbo denying she even
knew Mr. Gronowicz, who died in 1985. Simon &amp; Schuster Inc.,
a unit of Paramount Communications Inc., acquired the book in
1976, but in the wake of objections from Ms. Garbo, agreed
not to publish the book until after her death.
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, claims that
marketing for the book "leaves the unmistakable, yet false,
impression that Miss Garbo contributed substantially to the
work." The book, which is said to be told in Ms. Garbo's own
words, is slated to be published in June.
   Simon &amp; Schuster officials couldn't be reached for
comment.

   MUSICIANS' FREE-SPEECH rights aren't infringed by New York
subway system's ban on amplifiers, a U.S. appeals court said.
The decision, the second in recent weeks involving new subway
regulations, overturned a lower-court ruling that it was
unconstitutional to bar amplifiers in subway-platform
performances. The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said
the musicians' artistic concerns were outweighed by possible
safety hazards.
