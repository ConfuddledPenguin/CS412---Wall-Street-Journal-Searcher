   DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. -- ServiceMaster L.P. plans to revamp
its ownership structure sometime within the 18 months.
   C. William Pollard, chief executive, said he's considering
three alternatives for reshaping the company's ownership:
spinning off a segment, re-incorporating the company or
selling convertible debentures. Mr. Pollard, who will also
become the company's chairman on June 1, didn't indicate
whether he presently favors any of the choices.

   In a move that would facilitate a possible spinoff, the
company earlier this month named two presidents to head its
main operating groups, management services and consumer and
commercial services.
   Analysts indicated they'd like the company to take public
the consumer and commercial services division, which is the
fastest-growing part of the company. Mr. Pollard declined to
say whether a spinoff would likely involve that unit.
   ServiceMaster is considering the realignment because its
partnership structure is unattractive to institutional
investors. Less than 9% of its units are institutionally
owned, Mr. Pollard said.
