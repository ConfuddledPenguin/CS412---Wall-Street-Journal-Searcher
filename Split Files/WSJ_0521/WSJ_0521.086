   NEW YORK -- The government isn't providing enough
protection to investors who buy and sell U.S. Treasury
securities, the General Accounting Office says.
   In a draft report, the watchdog agency of Congress calls
for greater government control over the huge U.S. Treasury
market, the world's largest securities market.

   Although government-guaranteed Treasury bonds may seem
ultra-safe, many investors have discovered otherwise in
recent years. Some investors have been victimized by
questionable dealer sales tactics and have lost large amounts
of money, according to government officials. Critics also
complain that the public lacks timely information about bond
prices.
   The confidential GAO draft urges Congress to extend the
Treasury's rule-making authority over the government
securities market and to give the Treasury authority to write
rules governing sales practices of brokers and dealers. The
draft also calls on Congress to require greater public access
to bond-price information now held by the largest dealers and
brokers.
   Parts of the report, especially those urging more price
disclosure, have been widely expected. Many dealers and
brokers already are working on ways to sell their price
information to the public. They argue that this not only
would appease lawmakers, but also could represent an
important new revenue source at a time when many securities
firms and banks have been losing money dealing in Treasury
securities.
   Nevertheless, numerous dealers distrust Washington. They
fret that any further government regulation could undermine
the efficiency of the government securities markets, where
the daily trading volume typically exceeds $100 billion.
   The cover page of the GAO's draft report says the draft
"hasn't been fully reviewed within GAO and is, therefore,
subject to revision." Parts of the report, including an
"executive summary," were obtained by this newspaper.
   The study by the GAO is required by a 1986 federal law
that imposed regulations on banks and securities dealers that
trade government securities. That law was enacted by Congress
after several unregulated securities firms collapsed in 1984
and 1985, sending shock waves throughout the financial
markets.
   Under the law, GAO was told to evaluate the act's
effectiveness, recommend whether the Treasury Department's
limited authority over the government securities market
should be continued, and examine the controversial issue of
public access to bond prices.
   According to the GAO draft, the 1986 law "appears to have
improved investor safety" in the government securities
market. However, the draft also says "gaps remain in the
protection afforded to some individual and small
institutional investors," and that "these gaps could result
in investor losses due to abusive practices by dealers."
There is "some evidence that problems have occurred and that
investors have lost millions of dollars."
   Some state and local governments have been victims of
questionable sales practices, the report says. "Although
there is no way to be certain, some or all of such losses
might have been prevented by appropriate sales practice
rules," such as those governing price markups when government
bonds are sold.
   Complaints about huge price markups and high-pressure
telephone sales tactics by fast-talking salesmen have
bedeviled the government bond business in recent years. For
example, numerous towns have sued certain brokerage firms
based in Little Rock, Ark., accusing them of various trading
ploys that resulted in substantial losses to investors, and
the National Association of Securities Dealers has cracked
down on several firms.
   According to the GAO, the "biggest gap" is that the NASD
isn't permitted under exising law to apply its investor
protection rules, such as those on price markups, to the
government securities transactions of the nearly 1,400
dealers and brokers it monitors. The draft says "another
concern" is that the present law doesn't require bank
regulators or the New York Stock Exchange to look for abusive
practices in the government securities activities of the
firms they examine.
   "GAO believes that the absence of fair dealing rules {and
related specific enforcement authority} make transactions in
government securities by some individuals and smaller
institutional investors potentially vulnerable to abusive
dealer practices," the draft says.
   In its draft, the GAO urged Congress specifically to
require that bond brokers' pricing information "be made
available on a real time basis to those willing to pay
appropriate fees." The GAO says the availability of this
information is highly important because it will "make it
easier for investors to protect themselves by evaluating the
reasonableness" of prices quoted by dealers.
   The Public Securities Association, a trade group, has been
shown a copy of the GAO draft "to review for accuracy," says
Frances R. Bermanzohn, senior vice president and general
counsel. She says, "At this point, we're not surprised by
anything in it, which is different from saying we agree with
it. It's just about what we were expecting."
