   CINCINNATI -- Kroger Co. said it agreed in principle to
acquire 30 food stores and four others under construction
from the Meadowdale Great Scott] division of Meadowdale Foods
Inc., Detroit. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The proposed acquisition would double the number of Kroger
supermarkets in southeastern Michigan.

   Elizabeth M. Shiels, an analyst at Hilliard Lyons Inc.,
Louisville, Ky., said the proposal marks the first Kroger
would make since its recapitalization in 1988. "Management is
very prudent so I would assume the price was right," she
said. She declined to estimate how much Kroger would pay for
the stores.
   Kroger officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   In addition, Foodland Distributors said it will acquire
the operating assets of Meadowdale's Abner Wolf Distributors
wholesale division, as well as the four remaining Great
Scott] retail locations.
   Foodland, Livonia, Mich., is a joint venture between
Kroger and Wetterau Inc., St. Louis. Wetterau is a food
processor, distributor and retailer.
   Foodland will acquire Meadowdale's headquarters and
warehouse building. Foodland is a wholesale supplier to more
than 110 chain and independent retail stores in Michigan.
   Kroger and Foodland said they will assume certain of
Meadowdale's obligations and liabilities, including all trade
payables and real estate and equipment leases. The exact
amount hasn't been determined, said Greg Gallus, Foodland's
president.
   Completion of the transaction is subject to a definitive
agreement and regulatory approval. The transaction is
expected to be completed in the next two to three months,
Kroger said.
