   THE U.S. AND SOVIETS REACHED a partial pre-summit accord
on arms.
   After four days of superpower talks in Moscow, Soviet
President Gorbachev and Secretary of State Baker agreed on
treaty language to reduce long-range nuclear missile
arsenals. The U.S. and the Soviet Union also agreed to
destroy most of their chemical weapons. The moves make it
likely that Bush and Gorbachev will be able to declare the
missile treaty substantially complete, and next week's summit
in Washington a political success.

   ROMANIANS VOTED in free elections, and Iliescu appeared
headed to win.
   In the first multiparty elections in 53 years, as many as
16 million registered voters cast ballots to choose a
president and 506 representatives to Romania's Parliament.
Computer projections based on exit polls showed interim
President Iliescu capturing about 80% of the vote for
president, with the National Salvation Front, which has ruled
since Ceausescu was toppled in December, winning the
parliamentary balloting.
   Romanian opposition leaders alleged irregularities in the
elections and said they would contest the official results,
which are to be released this week.

   AN ISRAELI KILLED unarmed Arabs, sparking riots in the
occupied lands.
   In what was considered one of the bloodiest days since a
Palestinian uprising began 29 months ago, a gunman who was
dishonorably discharged from the army killed seven laborers
and wounded 11 other people in a town about 10 miles
southeast of Tel Aviv. He was arrested. Outraged Arabs
rampaged through the West Bank and Gaza Strip in rioting that
left seven more Palestinians dead. Arab leaders said the
incident could rekindle the flagging revolt against Israel.
   Israel's leaders condemned the attack on the workers and
urged calm as the army imposed curfews confining 1.1 million
Palestinians to their homes.

   South Korean police clashed with about 10,000
demonstrators who rampaged through the southern city of

the provincial city that was crushed by the military.

   Bush is expected to notify Congress this week that the
U.S. is renewing China's most-favored-nation trade status for
a year, administration officials said. The notification is
likely to be accompanied by a declaration that the trade
status could be revoked if the U.S. is unsatisfied with the
Beijing government's human-rights performance.
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's President Lee called for better ties with Beijing
as a first step toward eventual unification with the
mainland, a break with the ruling Nationalist Party's
40-year-old policy. In Beijing, police tightened security,
but the capital was calm on the first anniversary of the
imposition of martial law that preceded last year's
crackdown.

a critical housing shortage in the Soviet Union.

Walsh's final report to Congress.

territory it couldn't count on Washington's backing.
