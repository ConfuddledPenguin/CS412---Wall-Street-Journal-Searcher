   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and Congress are crossing
swords with increasing frequency on foreign policy, and that
indicates Mr. Bush can't take lawmakers for granted as he
moves toward agreements to reshape East-West relations.
   Congress has defied the president on a variety of
foreign-policy issues in recent weeks. Lawmakers tied down
his request for "emergency" aid for Panama and Nicaragua, and
they forced the administration to cut military aid to El
Salvador.

   The Senate declared that Mr. Bush shouldn't even bother
asking Congress to ratify a trade treaty with the Soviet
Union if the Kremlin continues to strong-arm Lithuania.
Congress also displeased the White House by saying it
recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital. And lawmakers are
moving on their own to impose sanctions against Iraq's
strongman, Saddam Hussein.
   "A lot of us think there's no political loss to
challenging the president on these issues, because the
American people don't support him," says Rep. Howard Berman
(D., Calif.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
who has led the drive for sanctions on Iraq.
   To some extent, such stands represent normal
congressional-White House jousting over control of foreign
policy. But they are a far cry from what the president and
his aides had counted on after Mr. Bush, in the first big
power test of 1990, was sustained on his controversial veto
of a bill that would have guaranteed Chinese students haven
in the U.S. The president, against the counsel of some of his
advisers, fought to get that veto upheld in hopes of
convincing lawmakers that he had the muscle to win such
disputes.
   Now it appears that Mr. Bush's stand on China may be
backfiring. After persuading Congress to let him handle U.S.
reaction to China's crackdown on pro-democracy students, Mr.
Bush has failed with his soft-spoken approach to persuade
China's leaders to loosen up. That sour outcome has
emboldened lawmakers to challenge the president on other
issues. And Mr. Bush's apparent decision to seek a renewal of
China's most-favored-nation trade status may cause more
bickering.
   This suggests Mr. Bush may encounter bumps in the road as
he tries to nail down agreements changing the U.S.-Soviet
relationship and repositioning the U.S. to deal with a
revamped Europe.
   There is broad congressional support for relaxing tensions
with the Soviets, and lawmakers are certain to favor new
arms-cutting pacts. But the Senate warning on the Soviet
trade treaty suggests that congressional sympathy for the
Baltic republics' attempts to break away from the Kremlin's
grip could complicate administration efforts to strike
economic agreements with Moscow.
   Many lawmakers think the trade treaty, for instance, would
mainly benefit the Soviets; as a result, it gives the U.S.
leverage that "we need to use," says Sen. Richard Lugar (R.,
Ind.), one of the president's strongest congressional allies
on foreign policy. The administration already is bending to
this sentiment, signaling it may drop plans to sign the trade
treaty at the May 31 U.S.-Soviet summit.
   Since Mr. Bush took office, he has preached that Congress
should keep its nose out of presidential foreign-policy
decisions. That blunt stand may be adding to the president's
problems by producing a backlash among lawmakers who want to
demonstrate they won't meekly defer to the president on
foreign policy.
   "There's a new school of presidential prerogatives, and I
don't like it one damn bit," says Sen. Daniel Moynihan, a New
York Democrat. He sparked a confrontation with the White
House by pushing an amendment to make it a criminal offense
for executive-branch officials to solicit money for, or
divert money to, activities for which direct U.S. foreign aid
is prohibited. The amendment is designed to prevent a repeat
of the Iran-Contra affair. Sen. Moynihan agreed to withdraw
his amendment after Mr. Bush cited it as one reason for
killing a State Department spending bill, but the lawmaker
pledges to raise it again.
   The administration also suffers because its acknowledged
master at stroking Congress on foreign policy, Secretary of
State James Baker, is preoccupied dealing with changes
sweeping over Eastern Europe.
   A bigger problem for Mr. Bush is a feeling, sometimes
uniting Democratic liberals and Republican conservatives,
that the president is too worried about the stability of
existing regimes in places such as Moscow and Beijing and
therefore too reticent to criticize their actions.
   "My guess is that my colleagues feel that in many
instances the president is showing an excess of tolerance"
for such regimes, says Rep. Berman. "Basically, I think the
American people like the idea of an American foreign policy
guided by a principle, and the principle is to encourage
democracy and human rights."
