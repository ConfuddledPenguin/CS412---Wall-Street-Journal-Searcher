   Mr. Hayes said the two companies would make a good
combination, as both specialize in manufacturing clothes for
the career apparel market. In fiscal 1989, Guilford earned
$26 million, or $2.67 a share, on revenue of about $620
million.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Posner said he raised his stake in Guilford to 10.3%
after buying 20,000 shares on May 3 for $22 a share and
88,100 shares for $20.625 a share.
