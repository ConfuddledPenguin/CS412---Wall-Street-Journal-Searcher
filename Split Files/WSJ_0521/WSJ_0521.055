   PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Electric Co. appealed an
April 19 decision by the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission that granted the utility only $242.2 million of
the $548.6 million rate increase it requested.
   Philadelphia Electric said that by denying the rate
request, the commission unconstitutionally denied
shareholders any return on their investment in Limerick No. 2
nuclear power station. In denying most of the rate increase,
the commission disallowed the company's request to recover
the costs of building and operating the plant.

   In the appeal, filed with the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Electric alleged that the
commission approved various aspects of the project in the
mid-1980s, and then "suddenly reversed course" this year.
