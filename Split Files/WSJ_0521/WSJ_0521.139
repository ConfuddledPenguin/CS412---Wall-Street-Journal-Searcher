   PARIS -- The defense and space unit of General Electric
Co. of Britain, GEC-Marconi Ltd., said late last week an
agreement is "very close" on cooperating with one of its
archrivals, Thomson-CSF S.A., on the next generation of
fighter-aircraft radar.
   Thomson-CSF, a unit of French state-owned Thomson S.A.,
declined to comment. GEC isn't related to General Electric
Co. of the U.S. GEC-Marconi said this would be the first
venture by Europe's two largest defense electronics
companies. The talks are the latest indication of the
transformation under way in the world's defense business,
after revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe, as Western
governments are cutting defense spending plans.

   A Thomson-GEC radar pact would be a first step toward
creating the first truly pan-European fighter aircraft.
France is building the Rafale, competing with a British, West
German, Italian and Spanish effort to develop the European
Fighter Aircraft. Thomson is involved in developing the
Rafale radar, and GEC-Marconi is developing the EFA radar.
The proposed radar cooperation wouldn't affect those programs
but would be aimed at a joint effort for any successor
programs.
