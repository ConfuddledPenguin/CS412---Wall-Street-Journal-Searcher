   DETROIT -- When the United Auto Workers held a conclave
here last month, the best-selling item at a booth outside the
meeting room was a T-shirt that read: "My Grandaddy is a UAW
Member." It easily outsold another shirt that made the same
boast about "My Daddy."
   The incident reflects the significant aging of the union's
ranks, which has been viewed as a big disadvantage by the Big
Three auto makers and by the UAW itself. But now, oddly
enough, this situation is shaping up as a potential solution
to the union's dearest goal: job security.

   UAW leaders gather today in Kansas City, Mo., to map out
strategy for this summer's national contract talks with the
Big Three. And it is clear that getting more older workers to
retire would help deliver the productivity gains that the Big
Three auto makers seek.
   It also would make it easier for the auto makers to give
stronger job guarantees to the younger members who are vital
to the union's future, says Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at
the University of California at San Diego. "You have an aging
work force, so the conditions of retirement are ever more
central to the union's demands," he says.
   Certainly, the union's previous attempts to guarantee job
security haven't worked. The current agreement includes a ban
on plant closings. But it hasn't stopped General Motors Corp.
and Chrysler Corp. from closing factories. The union's
efforts to develop cooperative programs with management
haven't stopped layoffs, either. Even company officials are
frustrated.
   "I would hope we would find the answers" to the
job-security issue in the forthcoming negotiations, says Lee
A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman. "I don't have the answers
yet. I hope we get some this summer."
   Now, some are arguing it is time to let nature take its
course. The demographic phenomenon overtaking the UAW is
clear. The average age of UAW employees at Big Three
companies is 45 years. More importantly, about 12% of the
blue-collar labor force is over 55 years of age. Another 20%
of GM's workers have 25 years of service and could leave by
1995.
   What is dividing the UAW's ranks is the issue of how to
encourage some of its grandfathers (and grandmothers) to give
up their jobs so that younger members can hold on to theirs.
   The current UAW contract requires the Big Three to hire
one new worker for every two who retire. If that clause were
eliminated, GM could reduce its work force by 4% to 6% a year
without layoffs.
   But that's not good enough for many older UAW members.
About 7% of the 300,000 UAW members who work for GM have the
requisite 30 years seniority to retire right now. But many of
these workers don't want to go unless they can get bigger
pensions. They form the core of a burgeoning movement among
UAW members pushing at this week's convention to make
cost-of-living adjustments to pensions a top priority in the
upcoming talks.
   "COLA on pensions is the only way you can get true job
security for the younger workers," says James Hale, leader of
the pension COLA movement. The 57-year-old Mr. Hale is an
example. He's been employed for 33 years at a GM parts plant
in Flint and could retire with a full pension today -- but he
won't. "I don't want to go out there on a fixed income," he
says.
   Mr. Hale says he's confident he can win on a roll call
vote at this week's convention. His cause gained a lot of
momentum when GM revealed that it wants to double the
pensions of 3,350 top executives, including soon-to-retire
Chairman Roger B. Smith.
   But even if Mr. Hale scores a victory this week, the auto
makers will insist they can't afford fatter pensions, and the
union's top leadership agrees.
   "I'm not opposed to increasing pensions, but I am opposed
to bankrupting the company that you've got to work for," says
Gary Watson, chairman of the union's GM bargaining council.
   UAW leaders argue that in the long run, they must help the
Big Three compete with the growing Japanese-operated
factories in the U.S., or risk seeing their union dwindle
even further.
   Despite more than three years of layoffs and plant
closings, GM's assembly plants have nearly five workers for
every car built, 48% more than the 3.36 workers per car Ford
Motor Co. has, according to a recent report by consultant
James Harbour. Chrysler uses an average 4.21 workers per car
per day at its assembly plants, 25% more than Ford. The U.S.
operations of Japanese auto makers have a similar or greater
productivity edge over GM and Chrysler.
   Because its plants are already running at or above 100% of
normal capacity, Ford could be in a better position to give
the UAW the kinds of job guarantees it wants than its
cross-town rivals -- just as it was in 1987. Indeed, Ford
executives are all but sending an engraved invitation to UAW
leaders to select them as the target for setting the contract
pattern this fall.
   A hefty agreement for the UAW at Ford could be a problem
for GM. "Ford could agree to some job security provisions
that we can't. And when they would bring them to us, then we
would have a strike on our hands," one GM official worries.
   But GM officials sounded similar warnings three years ago,
only to discover that the job protections ratified at Ford
weren't as tough as they looked.
   No matter which of the Big Three the UAW ultimately
selects to set the pattern, the union's demands for job
protections will be countered with company proposals aimed at
getting less resistance and more work from union employees.
   Top UAW leaders have backed away in recent months from
their once-enthusiastic line on labor-management cooperation,
or "jointness." This is partly a show of dismay that
"jointness" hasn't stopped GM or Chrysler from closing
factories. But it is also aimed at blunting internal
political pressure from UAW dissidents who label "jointness,"
a sellout.
   In recent local elections, UAW leaders failed in their
efforts to dislodge some of their more vocal and visible
critics in local union halls. Workers at GM's Buick City
assembly plant in Flint, for example, recently re-elected a
local union president who pledges to go slow on cooperative
endeavors. The Flint plant is one of GM's most efficient
facilities, and the plant's flagship product, the Buick
LeSabre, last year was named the highest-quality car built in
America by the influential consulting firm of J.D. Power and
Associates.
   GM's rank and file also voted in favor of labor militants
at GM's assembly plant in Lake Orion Mich., where the company
produces Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles, some of its most
profitable models.
   These local leaders could cause trouble for UAW president
Owen Bieber this week and during the contract talks this
fall. But Mr. Bieber is clearly banking on support from the
many local leaders who've concluded that, like it or not,
they must cooperate with management to survive.
   Consider what is happening at GM's Lordstown, Ohio, plant,
which was so plagued by labor strife during the 1970s that it
became a symbol of worker alienation.
   After GM announced that it would stop building full-size
vans at Lordstown next year, and eliminate half the jobs at
the facility, Lordstown workers voted to let GM run the car
assembly line continuously, except for a lunch break.
Previously, GM had to stop the line twice a day for 23-minute
morning and afternoon breaks. The new arrangement, "puts us
in the forefront of consideration for any new product
allocation in the future," says Lordstown union leader Bill
Bowers.
   Declares Buddy Stewart, a UAW leader from Texas: "If you
had a choice, would you put a new product in a place where
the union membership is not getting along with the
management? Hell no] That's just good business sense."
