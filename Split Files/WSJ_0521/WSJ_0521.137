   SYDNEY -- Victoria's Treasurer Tom Roper moved to allay
concerns over the Australian state's financial condition,
after Moody's Investors Service Inc. announced it is
reviewing for possible downgrade certain state-guaranteed
debt.
   Mr. Roper said the review would have no effect on
Victoria's ability to meet its commitments. "There is no
question about our ability to service the cost of borrowed
funds," he said.

   Moody's said earlier that it was reviewing for possible
downgrade all triple-A bond ratings assigned to the
Australian dollar-denominated, long-term obligations
guaranteed by the state of Victoria. Specifically, the rating
agency said it was reviewing the local-currency, long-term
debt of State Bank of Victoria and State Electricity
Commission of Victoria. Moody's cited as reasons for the
review a slowdown in the Australian economy, Victoria's
"relatively high" interest-cost burden and recent losses by
state-owned entities.
   The review affects 3.7 billion Australian dollars (US$2.82
billion) of long-term debt, Moody's said.
