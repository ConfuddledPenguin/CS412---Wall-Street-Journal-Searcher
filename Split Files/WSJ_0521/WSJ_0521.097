   After a four-week civil trial, a jury in U.S. District
Court in Baltimore Friday found that Contel Corp. defamed two
former employees, and awarded the two men a total of $8
million in punitive and compensatory damages, according to
one of the plaintiff's lawyers.
   William P. Kamachaitis, former president of Contel's
Fairfax, Va., federal-systems sector, was awarded $2.5
million in punitive damages and $2 million in compensatory
damages. Thomas Hassey, former vice president for human
resources of the sector, won $1.5 million in punitive damages
and $2 million in compensatory damages, said Mr. Hassey's
lawyer, Charles F. Chester, of Rockville, Md.

   Contel officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   The two men filed suit against the telephone holding
company in December 1987, contending they were defamed by
corporate officers in statements made to business
publications and Contel employees, as well as in internal
memos.
   Mr. Kamachaitis and Mr. Hassey were dismissed in May 1987.
