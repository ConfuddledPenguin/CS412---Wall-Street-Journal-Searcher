   Amax Inc., New York, said it won't make any takeover
proposal for Peabody Holding Co. other than the $1.25 billion
bid it made several days ago.
   Amax's proposal was immediately topped by Hanson PLC,
which holds 45% of Peabody, the largest U.S. coal producer.
In March, Hanson agreed to buy the 55% it doesn't hold from
Newmont Mining Corp. for $715 million.

   Amax's bid valued the 55% Peabody stake at $718.5 million,
just a bit more than Hanson's plan. After Amax's bid was
announced, Hanson boosted its offer to $725.6 million.
   "Amax's offer for Peabody was within our range of value
for the company," said Allen Born, Amax's chairman, president
and chief executive officer. The metals and energy company
"will continue to pursue and evaluate opportunities in its
energy businesses that have a good strategic fit for us and
will enhance the level and balance of future earnings."
   Many investors on Wall Street had doubted Amax would enter
a bidding war over Peabody. Hanson has interests in tobacco,
specialty chemicals, building products and mining, including
49% of Newmont Mining, Denver.
