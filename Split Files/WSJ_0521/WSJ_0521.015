   Delaware's passage of a bill to let banks underwrite and
sell insurance could make the state a springboard for
national insurance-marketing efforts by banks.
   A few other states allow a limited number of banks to
underwrite insurance. But the Delaware legislation, which
Gov. Michael Castle has promised to sign later this month,
goes much further. It opens the door to huge money-center and
superregional banks, several of which already have
financial-services operations in the state.

   Bankers see insurance as a multibillion-dollar business
opportunity, and they want to participate on a large scale.
The Castle administration and some state officials have
backed the measure because it holds the prospect of
generating thousands of new jobs that could help prolong
Delaware's economic boom.
   But a powerful insurance lobby argued vigorously that the
banks would bring unfair competition to the market. Some
major insurers, including New York-based American
International Group Inc. and Bloomington, Ill.-based State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., expressed fears that
banks will be allowed to set up insurance operations that
aren't capitalized separately from their primary businesses.
   "It's a bad bill, and it sets a bad precedent," says
Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of
AIG.
   The measure also raises some thorny issues for insurance
regulators, including policyholder protection, jurisdiction
and financial solvency.
   For instance, Delaware's guaranty fund, which would have
to be tapped to bail out an insolvent insurer, covers only
claims from state residents. James Long, North Carolina's
insurance commissioner, contends there wouldn't be any
protection for claimants living outside Delaware. Other
commissioners question whether Delaware regulators would be
able to go after the assets of a bank if its insurance unit
were to become insolvent.
   In 1982, Delaware insurance agents and their lobbyists
successfully beat back a similar proposal even before a bill
was formally introduced in the legislature. They weren't as
effective this time around. The current measure, which would
allow banks chartered in Delaware after 1933 to engage in all
aspects of the insurance business through separate divisions
or subsidiaries, had been passed by state's general assembly
last June.
   Some banks chartered before 1933 in Delaware are already
in the insurance business. Wilmington-based Wilmington Trust
Co., for example, owns and operates a brokerage firm and
markets insurance, but it doesn't underwrite coverage.
   Delaware is the first state to approve such a broad
measure. Other states have tried to take up the issue of
allowing banks to enter the insurance business, but agents
and insurers have generally managed to beat back the powerful
banking lobby. In Michigan, a state court recently supported
an order preventing a savings-bank unit from buying an
insurance agency. Meanwhile, in Florida, state-chartered
banks have settled for an amendment that would allow them to
sell annuities if federally chartered banks get the same
permission.
   For the time being, bankers consider the Delaware
legislation an important victory. Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan Corp., both New York-based, have been big backers
of the current measure. Last week, more than a dozen bank
lobbyists clogged the corridors of Delaware's Legislative
Hall in Dover, trying to gain the needed two-thirds majority
that would guarantee passage. The measure finally cleared
late Thursday night.
   Now major banks appear poised to seize the opportunity.
Citicorp, for example, indicates that it would be ready to
begin setting up insurance operations in Delaware as soon as
the governor signs the bill into law. NCNB Corp., Charlotte,
N.C., which announced last week that it will be consolidating
all of its credit-card operations in Delaware, may also be
interested in the insurance business, says David Swayze, an
attorney in Delaware who represents both NCNB and Citicorp.
   Dennis Shay, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
anticipates that, if banks can succeed in selling insurance
products to their regular clients, the appeal of starting
insurance units could reach far beyond the money-center and
superregional institutions. Insurance, he suggests, could
become like credit cards, which nearly every bank eventually
concluded it had to market. The challenge for banks is to
"push more products" through their existing distribution
channels, says Mr. Shay.
   Proponents of the Delaware bill believe banks will flock
to the state to set up national insurance operations. Indeed,
Delaware already has made itself something of a haven for
banks by relaxing its regulations in the early 1980s to allow
out-of-state banks to set up financial-services operations.
   Under the new Delaware legislation, banks can set up an
insurance unit or division, but they won't be allowed to use
the reserves or surplus capital required for banking
activities to help capitalize their insurance units. Banks
also won't be permitted to count their insurance unit's
capital as part of the capital requirements for their banking
operations.
   Even so, insurers worry that such a separation of assets
might not withstand a crisis. They fear that a troubled bank
could jeopardize or topple a healthy insurance operation.
Some insurers say they would have been more comfortable with
a plan that defined more clearly the separate business
entities, each with its own capital structure and
stockholders. AIG's Mr. Greenberg says he is angry that the
bill contains no provision to bail out an insolvent insurance
unit of a bank.
   In trying to defeat the banking bill, insurers were quick
to point out that bankers aren't always the best managers of
risks and assets, as the current thrift crisis shows. AIG
took out ads in local newspapers to air its negative views on
the banking bill.
   Insurance agents also argued that consumers would be at a
disadvantage in buying insurance from bankers, who are also
offering loans and mortgages. "There's a certain power that a
banker has," says Jack Bobo, president of the National
Association of Life Underwriters. "It immediately puts a
person negotiating with him in a lesser stance."
