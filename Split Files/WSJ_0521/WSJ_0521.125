   NEW YORK -- Recent reports of sluggishness in the economy
are likely to be reflected in this week's data, starting with
the revised estimate of first-quarter real gross national
product.
   The government's second shot at figuring GNP, or the total
value of the nation's output of goods and services, is
expected to be lower than the 2.1% annual growth rate logged
in the advance report at the end of April. There's reason to
believe the week's other offerings will also be weaker,
including: April durable goods orders as well as personal
income and personal consumption.

   Michael Moran, economist at Daiwa Securities USA, revised
his first-quarter GNP growth estimate down to about 1.6% from
the early 2.1% estimate "almost exclusively due to {lower}
inventory investment." The consensus view calls for a drop in
GNP to a 1.8% growth rate when the second estimate is
reported Thursday, according to MMS International, a unit of
McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.
   "I think what happened was a planned inventory correction,
so I don't think you'll see a sharp rebuilding by business in
the second quarter," Mr. Moran said. Nonetheless, he noted
that even a return to normal inventory investment in the
current quarter "could push growth on the higher side of
underlying trends." Many economists foresee an average GNP
growth rate of about 2% per quarter for the next couple of
periods.
   The chief affected industry, of course, is auto making.
Mr. Moran figures that during the first quarter auto makers
assembled cars at the annual rate of 5.9 million units. So,
if output simply keeps pace with sales during the second
quarter, the industry should produce at an annual rate of 6.5
million units, he said.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, said inventory adjustments subtracted about one
percentage point from GNP in the first quarter and should add
a like amount in the current period. "We ought to get a
pretty good inventory rebound," he said.
   Personal income figures, due out Friday, are expected to
show smaller gains than in March, largely because of April's
weaker-than-expected employment data. Manufacturing
employment fell during April as did the number of hours
worked in factories. The consensus view calls for a 0.3% gain
in April personal income, down from a gain of 0.8% in March.
   Personal consumption is expected to hold up somewhat
better, strengthened by continued gains in spending on
services and some pickup in non-auto durables, economists
said. The consensus view calls for a 0.4% increase in April
consumption, the same increase as in March.
   Economists expect a large fallback in April durable goods
orders following March's 6.7% surge. The consensus view on
the report due out Wednesday calls for a drop of about 2%
with the gap largely attributed to a slowdown in volatile
aircraft orders.
   While recent indicators show a sluggish growth pace,
economists are waiting for more employment data before
calling any major turns. April jobs data, due out a week from
Friday, could help confirm the lethargic pace or it could
throw another curve into forecasts by picking up some steam.
   In the meantime, Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji
Securities Inc., Chicago, is keeping a close eye on weekly
jobless claims, for hints on the direction of the next
unemployment report. The latest report for the week ended May
5 showed that initial claims for regular state unemployment
benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 353,000 from 349,000
the week before.
