   Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., Vancouver, British
Columbia, said it plans further reductions of kraft pulp
production at its British Columbia mills, in the face of
weakening market demand and growing inventories.
   A spokesman for the company, a unit of New Zealand-based
Fletcher Challenge Ltd., said the curtailments would reduce
kraft pulp output a total of about 36,000 metric tons. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   Fletcher Challenge Canada said the curtailments include
the idling for a week, beginning yesterday, of one of two
pulp lines at its Crofton mill on Vancouver Island, and the
shutdown of the same line for four weeks in July. The
company's Elk Falls mill, also on Vancouver Island, already
curtailed output by about 3,000 metric tons a month. The
Mackenzie mill, in northern British Columbia, has been
operating "considerably below capacity" and is reviewing a
plan for idle time in the third quarter, the company said.
All three mills closed for varying periods earlier in the
year.
