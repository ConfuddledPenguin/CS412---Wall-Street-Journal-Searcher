   The company said it granted the underwriters an option to
purchase an additional 1,425,000 shares to cover
overallotments. Salomon Brothers Inc. and Merrill Lynch
Capital markets, a unit of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., are the
underwriters.
   As a result of the offering, Banner Industries' beneficial

more closely related to its manufacturing focus.

replacement parts, including fasteners, avionics, bearings
and electrical and airframe parts.
