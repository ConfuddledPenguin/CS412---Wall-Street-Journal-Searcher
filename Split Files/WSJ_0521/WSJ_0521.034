   Being a TV critic isn't all beer and popcorn. Each year,
as the television season draws to a close, comes a task so
harrowing, so cruel, so downright difficult that it fries
even the professional couch potato. We're talking about the
Top 10 list.
   Once again this year, I set out to select the best
recurring programs on television -- the 10 shows I'd watch
even if it weren't my job to watch TV. I'm sorry to report
that, once again, I failed.

   So here's my Top Seven list, the cream of the 1989-90
season, in no particular order:
                                                                                                       

   "Twin Peaks" -- Half soap opera, half murder mystery, with
a strange dose of Tibetan mysticism thrown in, film maker
David Lynch's and Mark Frost's creation is an instant cult
classic. Fog shrouds the trees, and menace shrouds the town
of Twin Peaks, Wash. If the log knows who killed Laura
Palmer, it's not talking, and when the dwarf talks, you have
to read the subtitles. Some people just don't get this
startlingly idiosyncratic vision, but with any luck, the real
"Twin Peaks" mystery will be answered soon, and the show will
be renewed for next season.
                                                                                                       

   "Murphy Brown" -- Consistently the funniest half-hour on
television. Candice Bergen has developed some real comic
timing, and with her strong supporting cast, the crusty
newshound Murphy Brown may well become the Mary Richards of
the '90s. Now all she needs is a secretary.
                                                                                                       

   "thirtysomething" -- Yup, they're still whining. But in
its third season, "thirtysomething" just keeps getting
better, tackling heavyweight issues like ovarian cancer with
delicacy and insight. And for mapping rich and subtle human
relationships in the workplace and at home (Michael's
conflicting feelings about his corporate rise), no program
has a more sensitive ear.
                                                                                                       

   "Wonder Years" -- Deftly blending nostalgia and irony,
this slice of white-bread suburbia is as witty and warm as
ever. Maybe it does veer into shmaltz from time to time, but
the episodes about the math teacher who forced young Kevin to
study were little gems. There's just one question: What
happens when Kevin gets to high school?
                                                                                                       

   "Nightline" -- A decade after its inception, this program
is still afflicting the comfortable. Although the 10th
anniversary show was an uninspired clip job (and confused
everyone over whether that hair is real or not), Ted Koppel
has clearly established himself as the pre-eminent TV
interviewer in America. Let's hope the rumors about Mr.
Koppel leaving to anchor another network's evening newscast
are only rumors, because that would be a silly waste of his
talents.
                                                                                                       

   "60 Minutes" -- The perennial on the list. Newcomers Steve
Kroft and Meredith Vieira haven't really started pulling
their weight yet, but I'm still tuned in every Sunday at 7:00
p.m. EDT.
                                                                                                       

   "L.A. Law" -- Even "Law" devotees have to admit the show
is getting a little predictable. This year, it sneaks onto
the list with powerful final episodes portraying two senior
partners locked in a boardroom battle, as well as balanced
treatment of complex topical issues like homosexual "outing"
and punishment for juveniles.
   And there's one honorary award for the network news
divisions' coverage of a most extraordinary news year, from
the San Francisco earthquake to the Berlin Wall.
   That's it for this season. There were several interesting
new shows that will, if the networks don't stifle them, be
strong contenders for the next list: "Equal Justice," the
ultra-gritty district attorney's "Hill Street Blues";
"Shannon's Deal," John Sayles's delightfully written drama
about a down-and-out attorney (with a wonderful Wynton
Marsalis score); "Doctor, Doctor," featuring Matt "Max
Headroom" Frewer, one manic comic talent; "Peter Jennings
Reporting," which coupled with the ABC/Time forum provides
in-depth coverage of issues like gun control and Cambodia;
"Unplugged," MTV's best argument for less is more, where
electric rockers from Don Henley to Lou Reed go acoustic;
"Alien Nation," science fiction with a twist, a message of
racial tolerance; and yes, even "In Living Color," which,
obnoxious as it is, still delivers TV's funniest skits.
   To realize what makes these shows worthwhile, all you have
to do is look at everything else that was on TV this past
year. "Sister Kate," "Chicken Soup," "Jury Duty: The Comedy."
   Here's a list of shows I never quite got around to
watching. Remember, these are real shows: "Living Dolls" --
four teen-age models with minds of their own; "Baywatch" --
life's a beach for these studly lifeguards; "Top of the Hill"
-- a surfing congressman tackles trouble; "Free Spirit" -- a
young witch/housekeeper in a suburban home; "Doogie Howser,
M.D." -- a 16-year-old doctor; "Peaceable Kingdom" -- the
managing director of a zoo cares for creatures great and
small.
   And what about the so-called hit of the year, "America's
Funniest Home Videos"? Seeing a kid whack his father in the
head with a bat is funny? Seeing a woman fall off a horse is
funny? If you chuckled over those, we've got some hilarious
footage of World War II for you.
   In TV-land, imagination continues to be in short supply.
Does every show have to be about a cute family? There's
"Major Dad" (a cute Marine family), "The Cosby Show" (a cute
black family), "Empty Nest" (a cute grown-up family), "Who's
the Boss?" (a cute non-family family), "The Hogan Family" (a
cute family with a part-time dad), "My Two Dads" (a cute
family with two dads), "Full House" (a cute family with three
dads), and "A Family for Joe" (a cute family with four
orphans, a homeless man and no dad).
   Bad ideas once become even worse ideas as comebacks. "The
Bradys"? Again? "Island Son"? A Hawaiian Kildare? Once a
heartthrob, Richard Chamberlain is now a cardiac infarction.
And how about Brent Musberger, the Mush Man? Just when we
thought we were finally done with him, ABC picks up his
contract. How can one guy who knows so little about sports,
and who is so aggressively dull, con two different networks
into hiring him for $2 million a year? Now there's an idea
for a new comedy show.
   Finally, this year, a mystery for the networks -- the
mystery of the vanishing viewers. In a few short months
recently, the audience numbers have plummeted yet again -- as
much as 8%.
   But there's no real mystery to this one. Just try putting
together a Top 10 list of your own.
