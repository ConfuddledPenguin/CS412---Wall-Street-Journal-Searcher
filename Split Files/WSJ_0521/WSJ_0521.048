   In his comments on the "global-warming" hoax, Paul A.
Gigot (Potomac Watch, April 20) states that ". . . everyone
agrees the earth has gotten slightly warmer in the last 100
years." It may be of interest to cite what Mark Twain had to
say in "Life on the Mississippi," published in 1883:
   "Natchez (Miss.) is the furthest point to the north at
which oranges ripen . . . or endure the winter without
shelter."

   Several pages further along:
   ". . . for many miles above New Orleans . . . the graceful
and luxuriant palmetto . . . and the bright orange, were
everywhere to be seen. . . ."
   Our winters on the Gulf Coast are now so cold that
unprotected orange groves survive only in southernmost
Florida. Attempts to grow oranges south of New Orleans are
regularly frozen out every few years. Those few Louisiana
palmetto trees that had survived previous harsh winters were
frozen by the severe cold of December 1989.
   Perhaps Mark Twain was secretly employed by the
anti-environmentalists?
