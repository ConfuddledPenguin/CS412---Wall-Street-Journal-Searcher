   WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department reportedly is
considering buying uranium-enrichment services from the
Soviet Union as part of an arrangement designed to stop the
Soviets from undercutting the U.S. in the lucrative business.
   A spokesman for the department refused to confirm or deny
reports circulating on Capitol Hill and within the nuclear
industry about a pending deal. The spokesman would say only
that the department is considering a "range of alternatives"
to make it more competitive in the uranium-enrichment
business.

   The U.S. currently is the world's largest supplier of
uranium-enrichment services, deriving $1.5 billion annually
from selling the services to nuclear utilities in the U.S.
and abroad, according to the Energy Department. But two years
ago, V/O Techsnabexport, the Soviet agency that markets
uranium-enrichment services, began cutting into the U.S.
market, selling its services at less than half those charged
by the department.
   Under one version of a U.S.-Soviet deal being discussed,
the department would buy cheaper Soviet fuel-enrichment
services and resell them to its customers. The Soviets, in
turn, would refrain from underpricing the department in the
U.S.
   Such an arrangement would give the Soviets hard currency
and official entree into the U.S. market, in turn making
political attempts here to ban their cheaper services more
difficult. At the same time, the ability to resell the
cheaper Soviet services would give the Energy Department a
way to keep some of its long-term customers, while retaining
control over the portion of the U.S. market going to the
Soviets.
   During the past several months, three of the Energy
Department's biggest customers, including the Tennessee
Valley Authority, have announced that they are terminating
some of their long-term contracts.
   The TVA announced earlier this year that it is inviting
providers other than the Energy Department to bid on
supplying fuel for its nuclear power plants. Bob Calabro,
manager of nuclear fuel for TVA, said that the huge,
federally owned power complex also is considering buying some
cheaper enrichment services on the spot market. "The Soviets
are the market maker today," he noted.
   The first glimmer of a possible U.S.-Soviet deal came from
New York Nuclear Corp., a tiny nuclear brokerage firm
operated from a home in Scarsdale, N.Y. "It's sort of a
win-win situation for everybody involved," asserted Daniel
Einbund, vice president of the concern.
   Mr. Einbund said the firm presented the idea to Soviet
officials in Moscow in December and received a letter of
interest. It then took the letter to the Energy Department.
"DOE wanted information about many details, including
transportation and what they are going to do with the money,"
Mr. Einbund said.
   According to Mr. Einbund, the Soviets agreed to spend
money they receive from the potential $200 million deal on
products and equipment in the U.S. At that point, he said, he
was told the proposal had risen "to very, very high levels in
Washington and Moscow."
   The hardest evidence that the Energy Department is
considering a departure from its old ways arrived on Capitol
Hill last month. The department submitted a one-line budget
proposal that would allow it to buy uranium on the world spot
market, which is dominated by Techsnabexport. The proposal --
first reported by Nuclear Fuel, a newsletter published by
McGraw-Hill -- immediately set off rumblings on Capitol Hill.
   "If I read between the lines, I think we are about to
enter into an agreement with the Soviet Union," Sen. Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.) told William H. Young, the Energy
Department's assistant secretary for nuclear energy. Mr.
Young replied only that the department was concerned about
growing Soviet sales and was looking at "a range of
alternatives" to shore up its market.
   To ease concerns on Capitol Hill, according to Mr.
Einbund, the deal would allow aging U.S. enrichment plants at
Paducah, Ky., and Portsmouth, Ohio, to keep operating,
although they are believed to be much more expensive to run
than newer Soviet plants, which use high-speed centrifuges.
The Soviets, he said, would agree to use uranium mined in the
U.S. as a feedstock.
   Uranium enrichment is an elaborate process that turns
natural uranium into a gaseous compound and then restructures
it so that an unstable isotope, or rare chemical relative of
uranium -- called U-235 -- becomes more concentrated.
   The U.S. enrichment program began during World War II as
part of the country's nuclear-weapons program. After the war,
the U.S. switched most of its uranium-enrichment capability
to providing fuel for the then-growing nuclear power
industry. For two decades, the U.S. government enjoyed a
near-monopoly on the enrichment business in the non-Communist
world.
   While both U.S. and Soviet uranium-enrichment facilities
were originally designed to provide highly enriched uranium
for atomic bombs, both countries later switched to a
different metal, plutonium, for their nuclear arsenals.
Plutonium is derived from a different process.
   The major remaining military need for enriched uranium is
for fuel for nuclear submarines and ships. According to the
Energy Department, 10% of U.S. output is used for military
purposes.
