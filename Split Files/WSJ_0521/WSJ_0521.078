   NORFOLK, Va. -- Norfolk Southern Corp. announced the sale
and sublease of major rail facilities in eastern Ohio and
western Pennsylvania to Wheeling Acquisition Corp.
   Norfolk Southern sold 446 miles of track and facilities in
Akron, Canton and Brewster, Ohio, to Wheeling for about $40
million. Wheeling, a new corporation created to acquire the
properties, will also sublease the 121-mile Pittsburgh and
West Virginia Railway, now leased from a real-estate
investment trust by Norfolk Southern's Norfolk and Western
Railway subsidiary.

   The new railroad will extend from Bellevue, Huron and
Cleveland south to the Ohio River, and east and south to
Connellsville, Pa. It will also have access to existing
Norfolk Southern yards in Cleveland and Bellevue, Ohio, and
Hagerstown, Md., and interconnections with CSX, Conrail and
other rail carriers in the region.
   The sale continues Norfolk Southern's program of spinning
off rail properties that can be run more economically by
smaller lines. Roughly 425 employees now work on the lines
involved in the sale; the new railroad expects to have a work
force of about 380 in its first year.
   As part of the $40 million sale, Norfolk Southern will
provide financing to Wheeling of up to $16.7 million for
existing rolling stock, including locomotives and freight
cars.
