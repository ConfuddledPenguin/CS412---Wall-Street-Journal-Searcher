   REDMOND, Wash. -- Even when William Gates III loses, he
seems to win.
   Tomorrow, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder will demonstrate
this neat trick when he unveils a program that makes it far
easier for 40 million users of personal computers to run
their machines. The program, called Windows 3.0, promises to
increase Microsoft's already-soaring profits and cement Mr.
Gates's position as the single most influential figure in the
computer industry.

   Yet its success comes in part from the miserable
performance of Microsoft's most ambitious project ever, a new
personal-computer operating system called OS/2. That system,
introduced three years ago with the backing of mighty
International Business Machines Corp., today languishes,
showing few signs of catching on. But Microsoft doesn't
languish with it.
   For even as he was developing OS/2, Mr. Gates kept
tinkering with his "Windows," a program Microsoft had
announced seven years ago. While competitors long paid
Windows little heed -- even ridiculed it -- Mr. Gates
gradually improved its power and ease of use as a new type of
command system.
   With snazzy graphics and the power to display numerous
programs on the screen at once, Windows accommodates existing
PC applications yet uses computer memory and power more
efficiently, making less-expensive PCs more useful. Now,
dozens of computer manufacturers are ready to announce that
they will buy the new Windows (it's $150 if purchased alone)
from Microsoft and give a copy to every buyer of their
machines.
   Analysts expect Windows-related products to generate at
least $350 million of sales for Microsoft in the next year.
The new Windows will strengthen the software company even
more in its rivalry with Lotus Development Corp., a firm that
hit a snag over the weekend when its merger with Novell Inc.
fell through
   The big loser in all of this could be Apple Computer Inc.,
whose own easy-to-use Macintosh command system, using menus
and images, made that machine a huge success. Apple is suing
Microsoft, claiming Windows is too close to Macintosh
software.
   Mr. Gates's long struggle to make Windows work reflects
traits not often combined in a business leader: technological
vision, a love of crafty dealmaking and an obsessive, almost
childlike personality, which drives him to seek every
possible edge. He manages to motivate employees and provoke a
flow of ideas even though he often harshly criticizes workers
face to face.
   Despite his lack of tact, he forges alliances with rival
companies, overcoming occasional charges that he is ruthless
and takes unfair advantage of a potential conflict of
interest: Microsoft both supplies the basic operating
software that producers of applications programs need, and
sells rival applications.
   Mr. Gates hates to lose. "Some of the fiercest competition
he feels is a race with his older sister to finish a
300-piece puzzle," says his mother, Mary. "That's as exciting
to him as putting out a new piece of software."
   In Microsoft's early years, Mr. Gates was plagued by
periods of doubt or depression. "There were certainly lots of
occasions when his attitude was everything is going to hell
in a handbasket," says his father, William Gates II. His mood
has been more upbeat for the past three years, buoyed by
Microsoft's huge success as both a setter of computing
standards and a purveyor of applications. Today the
34-year-old Mr. Gates, as the owner of 35.8% of Microsoft, is
a multibillionaire.
   Yet he remains a nonstop worrier. He often rocks himself
in a chair during meetings to contain his intensity. (He says
the habit has its roots in a boyhood overuse of a cradle and
a rocking horse.) A workaholic, he can count on one hand the
vacations he's taken in the past decade.
   Why this racehorse pace? He is convinced that in an
industry changing so rapidly, missed opportunities are
irretrievably lost -- that there won't be many second chances
in his quest to occupy computing's catbird seat. He is still
gripped with a fear he'll end up as an also-ran by missing
the next major technical wave or failing to hire a seminal
programmer. "You always have to be thinking about who is
coming to get you," he says.
   Microsoft's past blunders also make Mr. Gates anxious. The
company mishandled its entry into the business of making
software that ties PCs together; it now plans to offer an
improved product and revamp its sales effort. A long campaign
to get manufacturers to include an optical storage device as
a basic part of the PC hasn't borne fruit. And Microsoft
decided to scrap the release of its first data-base
management product because so far it isn't distinctive
enough.
   "I'd say there's as much stuff screwed up now {at
Microsoft} as there always is," Mr. Gates frets.
   Paranoia aside, he was probably born to be a high-tech
tycoon. He has always single-mindedly pursued his own goals.
His mother used to tell him he couldn't afford gambling at
cards, but "he didn't pay a bit of attention, like he never
did since he was eight," she says. He also wouldn't pick up
his clothes, even when his parents began taking them away
from him. "We finally got down to the point where the only
rule was `close the door' " of his room, his father recalls.
"And he wouldn't always do that."
   Even as a teen-ager, he was driven to cut deals. Before
finishing high school he ran two small software businesses,
one providing a payroll program and one interpreting traffic
data. Mr. Gates always had trouble taking a no from a
customer. He once demonstrated his traffic device to a
Seattle official in his mother's dining room. When it crashed
and the official lost interest, "I remember Bill pleading
with me: `Tell him, Mom, tell him it really works]' " Mrs.
Gates says.
   At 21, he showed a zeal for capitalism that astonished his
hacker peers. Personal computing was dominated those days by
social rebels suspicious of the profit motive. But when
enthusiasts copied his personal-computer version of BASIC
computer language without paying him royalties, he wrote a
stinging denunciation in a leading newsletter, calling them
thieves.
   He's still consumed with business, and his father fears
"there are aspects of his life he's defaulting on, like being
a father." Mr. Gates is single and lives austerely save for
his expensive cars. "We'd love to see Bill get married and
have a few kids," says Willard E. Peterson, executive vice
president of WordPerfect Corp. "We'd love to see him mellow
out."
   Fat chance. He is currently plotting to put his operating
systems into fax machines and electronic notepads, and he
wants Microsoft to excel in supplying databases, networking
and home-entertainment software as well. "His goal is to
dominate every aspect of computing," says Mitch Kapor,
another software pioneer.
   Some of Mr. Gates's rivals fear his competitive cunning,
suspecting that he induced them to throw their resources into
developing applications for OS/2 while he made hay producing
Windows applications -- and then improved Windows so much
they couldn't ignore it. Software firms could "never be more
leery than they already are" about Microsoft's intentions,
says Jim Manzi, CEO of Lotus.
   Mr. Gates denies misleading competitors, and argues that
for years Microsoft encouraged software firms to write for
Windows. Some, such as Lotus, didn't do so, and now can't
quickly exploit growing demand for Windows programs. In
contrast, Microsoft is likely to sell $244 million worth of
Windows applications in its fiscal year beginning July 1,
predicts Shearson Lehman Hutton. Sales of the main program
may total $100 million.
   Still, the drive to establish a following for Windows --
even while developing OS/2 for IBM -- almost cost Mr. Gates
his prized relationship with the computer giant. Mr. Gates,
who had co-founded Microsoft in 1976, didn't come to real
prominence until four years later when he supplied the MS-DOS
operating program for IBM's first PC. The IBM link helped
Microsoft set the most important PC standards, spawning an
entire industry around its MS-DOS operating software. The
standard allowed personal computers made by IBM competitors
to run the same word processors, spreadsheets or other
applications.
   "It's sort of like we're this IBM lab that they don't own
or control," says Jon Shirley, who is Microsoft's president
(he's retiring soon). "Yet they have to work with us as if
we're one of their own."
   But on the question of how to make PCs easier to use, IBM
almost parted ways with Mr. Gates. MS-DOS is notoriously
complex, so in 1983 he began work on a new approach to
controlling PCs, similar to the Apple Macintosh's. By slicing
up the screen into separate and movable sections, or windows,
it also lets a user switch easily from task to task.
   For years, IBM ignored this "Windows," instead paying
Microsoft generously to help it produce the new OS/2
operating system. But last November, under pressure from
customers disenchanted with OS/2, IBM said people with older
or less expensive PCs should use Windows, whose following was
already broadening.
   Even today, Mr. Gates's relationship with IBM is stormy,
and he can't always get Big Blue to stick with Microsoft to
the exclusion of rivals. In February, IBM said publicly that
it would offer its new family of workstations with a piece of
system software made by Steve Jobs's Next Inc. instead of
Microsoft. The next month, IBM decided not to use Microsoft
printer software for its full range of computers.
   Though his ties with IBM are most useful, Mr. Gates's
power rests even more in his ability to patch together
alliances of warring industry factions. "Even Microsoft can't
unilaterally impose standards on the industry," says Michael
Swavely, president of Compaq Computer Corp.'s North American
operations. So Mr. Gates tries to strike accords with most
everyone of importance in the industry, making himself the
focal point of most attempts to create standards for new
computer technologies.
   But he sometimes trips on his complex web, frustrating
allies. For instance, executives at Hewlett-Packard Co. were
stunned last year when Microsoft struck a deal with Apple to
jointly develop printer software, even though Apple has a
suit pending against Microsoft. H-P has its own approach to
printer software, which it considers worthy of Microsoft's
support. Yet Microsoft didn't even warn H-P of the impending
deal.
   Mr. Gates is a tough negotiator. Even if Microsoft thinks
it can improve its operating software with code developed by
outsiders, it won't pay a royalty. "It's just bad business,"
Mr. Gates says, because he must sell his operating software
cheaply. Though it rankles, some companies agree to forgo
cash.
   Last year, for instance, Mr. Gates tried to strike a deal
with Adobe Systems Inc., which sells software to control the
size and shape of computerized type. Microsoft asked Adobe
for the right to include these programs in its operating
software, arguing that a linkup might vastly expand Adobe's
markets -- but not offering any royalty money. Adobe refused.
Within months, in what amounted to a declaration of war
against Adobe, Mr. Gates joined with Apple to produce its own
solution.
   But rather than bullying rivals, Mr. Gates often gains an
edge simply by outlasting or outsmarting them. Phillipe Kahn,
CEO of Borland International Inc., phoned Mr. Gates last
month when he learned Microsoft had hired his chief of
research. Mr. Kahn accused Mr. Gates of violating an
agreement not to steal each other's employees. The deal had
expired, Mr. Gates said. Mr. Kahn protested, but only until a
check of his own records proved Mr. Gates right.
   Mr. Gates can rattle off the specifications of dozens of
competing products and is known to recite claims made in
competitors' ads. He's always loath to surrender a sale. Last
month, hearing that a Wall Street firm was considering the
rival Unix operating system over OS/2, he met with the firm's
principals and persuaded them to delay until he could
personally deliver another pitch.
   His persistence isn't lost on Microsoft's executives. Last
fall he publicly said that his product managers ought to wake
up thinking about their main competitor and even to know his
or her children's names and birth dates. Taking no chances,
Jeff Raikes, manager of the word-processing business, asked
his counterpart at WordPerfect to send him the information.
Mr. Raikes now keeps a photo of the competitor's children in
his office and has memorized their birthdays, in case Mr.
Gates inquires.
   Sales may be an obsession with Mr. Gates, but writing code
is closest to his heart. Discussions with Microsoft engineers
resemble a legal proceeding, with Mr. Gates as prosecuting
attorney. Often, he begins by asking simple questions, then
insists he understands a problem better than those assigned
to solve it. At one recent meeting, he described a program as
"the stupidest piece of code ever written," repeatedly noting
that a tiny competitor had done a better job.
   Yet he doesn't insist engineers stand on ceremony. At the
same meeting, one cradled a football while another flipped
through a computer magazine. A third rebutted several of Mr.
Gates's points with no show of reverence. Engineers tend to
be loyal to Mr. Gates because he shares their concerns and
their sense of humor.
   Even though Microsoft now has 5,000 employees, Mr. Gates
keeps in contact with its engineers by dispatching memos over
the company's electronic mail network, sometimes as many as
30 in a day. After reading one a year ago, Lloyd Frink
started a project to develop software for notepad computers
that recognize handwriting. The project involves just seven
people and is one of dozens like it at Microsoft, yet Mr.
Gates regularly gives tips to Mr. Frink.
   Talk that Mr. Gates might someday tire of his regimen of
round-the-clock meetings and incessant travel is dismissed by
close associates. While he is less likely to indulge his
emotions these days, little else about him has changed. Says
David Marquardt, a Microsoft director: "My great hope is that
Bill will never grow up."
   Maybe he won't. He still loves games. As a child, he
played cards with his sisters to determine who did the
dishes. Now, each summer Mr. Gates, his parents and two
sisters hold a competition called "Microgames" at a summer
house. The family invites about 90 people and divides them
into six teams, which battle it out in a series of events
while the Gateses look on as judges.
   Bill's favorite last year was a contest to build the best
sand castle. He trucked in six tons of sand for the event.
