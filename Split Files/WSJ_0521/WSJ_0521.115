   Scotti Brothers Entertainment Industries Inc., a privately
held entertainment concern in Los Angeles, said it reached an
option agreement which gives Scotti the right to acquire
42.5% of the shares outstanding of All American Television
Inc.
   All American Television Inc., based in New York, is
engaged in the distribution of television programming and the
sale of commercial time to advertisers. Scotti said the
agreement, reached with certain principal shareholders of All
American, gives Scotti the right to acquire all of their
shares at a price of $6.25 a share. The agreement further
stipulates that not less than $3.50 a share will be paid in
cash, and the balance in securities.

<TEXT>
   The option agreement contemplates a merger, business
combination or similar transaction between Scotti and All
American, the companies said. Scotti Brothers may not
exercise the option unless it offers to acquire all of the
stock of All American owned by public shareholders on terms
at least as favorable as those given to the company's
principal holders, the companies said.
   Scotti Brothers' exercise of the option is also
conditional, among other things, upon All American's
satisfying certain financial conditions. The option agreement
expires Aug. 16, unless extended, and if exercised, the
closing must occur by Dec. 14, 1990, subject to extension.
