   News International PLC, London, which is part of the
Australian-based News Corp. Ltd., said that it is setting up
a joint venture with Burda Verwaltungs G.m.b.H., of West
Germany, for printing units in both East and West Germany.
   No financial details are being released, said a News
International spokeswoman. A "great deal of discussion on
many factors" still has to take place, she said.

   The agreement, so far, includes the current Burda plant in
Darmstadt being spun off into a new joint venture company
called Burda News Druck G.m.b.H. That company will print some
of the five million Sunday magazines, a supplement
accompanying News International's British Sunday newspaper
the News Of The World. There are no other details on how the
plant will be used, said the spokeswoman.
   The two companies also agreed in principle to set up a
joint venture to print works in East Germany, said the
spokeswoman. No sites or financing proposals have been
decided, she said.
