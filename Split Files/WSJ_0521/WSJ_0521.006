   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- It's Friday night at the La
Cucaracha Lounge. Inside the smoky, cavernous bar, a blaring
Mexican-Western band has the joint jumping.
   But outside, Rudy Davila and Horace Neaves are about to
give the bar the silent treatment.

   The two hulking figures in gray and white uniforms ease
their white pickup truck to the curb and aim a black
apple-sized microphone toward the din spilling into the
street. A dial on the attached box swings to the figure 78.
   "Burn 'em," orders the 6-foot-4 Mr. Davila, as he and Mr.
Neaves pile out, and like lawmen from some old Western, part
a wake through the revelers. They slap a ticket on the club's
owner that will mean $98 in fines and court costs.
   Forget the Alamo. San Antonio has a new, and some think
equally lost cause: enforcing a six-month-old city ordinance
making it illegal to be too loud. Noise abatement is nothing
new, of course. Make too much of a racket anywhere, and you
can earn a disturbing-the-peace citation. Many cities also
have specific limits for everything from car mufflers to jet
airplanes. But most enforce their rules case-by-case, in
response to complaints, often using off-duty police officers.
   San Antonio has tiptoed one step beyond: In the duo of Mr.
Davila, 29, and Mr. Neaves, 57, it has a new, full-time team
of official noise-busters. The two beat cops are empowered
not only to answer complaints but also to sample ambient
sounds and write citations at will. To get the job done, they
have been outfitted with a $7,600 portable sound analyzer,
badges and guns. "To my knowledge . . . that's unique," says
Joseph Soporowski, director of the Noise Technical Assistance
Center at New Jersey's Rutgers University.
   So far, the silence sentries have brought to justice
several raucous saloons and, alas, a hapless bride and groom
whose wedding reception band was a bit too enthusiastic.
They've also stalked a cantankerous parrot, some obnoxious
roosters and a man who, clad only in underwear, periodically
serenades his next-door neighbor.
   They've even busted God. Sort of. They forced the South
Zarzamora Baptist Church to tone down its bell tower chimes.
The chimes, programmed to play hymns only during the day,
developed a nasty habit of malfunctioning in the wee hours,
waking neighbors to strains of "How Great Thou Art."
   Some see San Antonio as leaping into a quiet cause
abandoned by the federal government. Around the country,
"there are a lot of regulations, but they aren't being
enforced," maintains Mr. Soporowski. He says that federal
noise control efforts have all but ended with deep budget
cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Moreover, he says, people underestimate the harmful
effects of noise. At 65 decibels -- the average level of
noise in Manhattan, the country's loudest urban center -- it
interferes with normal conversation.
   Constant noise above 85 decibels -- such as eight hours of
a screaming child -- can deaden hearing, adds Joseph J.
Rizzo, executive director of Better Hearing Institute. Others
say loud noise can cause blood vessel contractions that
produce headaches, fatigue, higher blood pressure and even
heart attacks. It also can disrupt concentration, cause
stress and lead to a mental breakdown.
   For folks in San Antonio, however, relief is on the way.
The city has set a legal limit for "vexing, hazardous" sound
at 74 decibels in most instances, when measured from the
sidewalk property line. "We're here to protect their health,"
declares Mr. Davila.
   What started as a simple effort to hush up some loud bars
produced the sweeping city ordinance that makes sounds above
the prescribed limits cause for a summons. Fines can range
from $35 to $1,000, more after a second offense. After a
third, the officers can seek a search warrant and remove the
source of the noise. So far, more than 50 citations have been
issued.
   Mr. Davila and Mr. Neaves work lousy hours -- 7:30 p.m. to
4:30 a.m. -- but that's when noise carries most easily and is
most disruptive.
   Their main target most nights is a strip of bars and
restaurants along St. Mary's Street, which divides a
residential neighborhood. As word spreads that the two are
heading down St. Mary's, armed with handcuffs, .357 Magnums
and the sound analyzer swung over one of their shoulders, bar
employees scramble to warn their bosses. The manager of
Wacky's, a popular live-music spot, rushes inside after being
told his music is too loud. He returns and obsequiously asks,
"Is that better?"
   Mr. Davila complains that he and Mr. Neaves are becoming
too well known. "Eventually, we may have to go undercover,"
he jokes. At times the two park their truck blocks away and
slip through back alleys to nail an unsuspecting decibel
deviator.
   Mr. Neaves, a former police sergeant and a cop for 36
years before taking this job, admits that some of his former
colleagues poke fun at him, turning conspicuously quiet when
he's around.
   "I can't believe how quiet it is," says Mr. Davila,
standing in a crowd of young bar-hoppers on St. Mary's
Street. "Before, you couldn't hold a conversation out here."
   Most residents -- especially those over 40 -- praise the
effort. "I'm in favor of it. I hate noise," says Larry Ronald
White, 43. That's noteworthy, for Mr. White recently was
ticketed because a rock-n-roll band playing on his patio for
his daughter's wedding reception was making too much racket.
   Understandably, the 24-year-old bride was a little less
charitable about the citation. She "thought it was terrible,"
Mr. White admits. The fine was dropped after Mr. White wrote
to a judge pointing out that he was a first-offender and that
his house was really "not a big noise center."
   Owners of some local night spots are less enthusiastic.
"If I had known the noise ordinance was going into effect I
wouldn't have gotten into this business," contends bar owner
Marty Bane. "It restricts you so much; you can't do
anything."
   Mr. Bane has taken precautions, though. After being fined
$35 for having a too-loud band, he spent another $35 on his
own Radio Shack decibel reader and then hired someone at $5
an hour to use it, as well as to warn him when the noise-cops
are around.
   Claude Morgan, an employee of the Maui Waui T-shirt store,
previously forced to lower the volume of a "boom-box" tape
player out front, has launched a more obnoxious
counterattack. When Mr. Davila and Mr. Neaves show up, he
bursts into a wild laugh, then asks if that's a violation.
Sometimes he puts "Noise-Cops" on the tape player, an
original song that he and a friend composed that repeats the
title -- loudly -- ad nauseam.
   Despite the grumbling, most business owners are caving in.
The real trouble comes from rowdy patrons who openly defy the
enforcers, says Mr. Davila. The towering 268-pound officer
got into a scuffle with one drunken man who claimed to be
defending a constitutional right to make noise. The encounter
was no contest.
   The dynamic duo's brushes with the animal kingdom have
been less successful. A loudmouthed parrot flew the coop as
they arrived. "We could see a perch where they kept it
outside, but it wasn't there," Mr. Neaves recalls. Four
German shepherds kept behind a chain-link fence gave the
officers the silent treatment. "We went out three different
times and they never barked once," he adds. And 15 roosters
that occupied a back yard pulled the same stunt. As the
officers waited for the morning song, nothing happened. "They
made chicken noises, but no crowing," says Mr. Davila.
   Then there's the mysterious serenader who reportedly
stands on his roof at 2:30 a.m. in his skivvies while he
sings to his next door neighbor, asleep by her bedroom
window. Every time, the nocturnal Don Juan scrams before the
noise busters show up.
   "We think he disappears when he sees her make a phone call
{to the police}," says Mr. Davila. "It's bizarre," he says
with a silent shrug.
