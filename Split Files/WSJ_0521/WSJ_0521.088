   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny Ludlum Corp. said Robert P.
Bozzone, president and chief operating officer, was named
chief executive officer of this specialty steel producer.
   The specialty metals producer also declared a 3-for-2
stock split and increased its dividend to 33 cents a share
from 30 cents.

   Mr. Bozzone, 57 years old, succeeds Richard P. Simmons,
59, who continues as chairman and chairman of the executive
committee. Mr. Simmons will concentrate on strategy,
acquisitions and management succession.
   A graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Mr.
Bozzone started at the company in 1955 as a metallurgist. He
held several management operating posts prior to being named
president and chief operating officer in 1985.
   Both the split and dividend are payable July 2 to stock of
record June 8. Following the split, the quarterly dividend
will be 22 cents a common share. On a pre-split annual basis,
the dividend is increased to $1.32 a share from $1.20 a
share. The company said the dividend was raised because
"business has been stronger than anticipated." The split will
increase the number of the company's common shares
outstanding to 33,494,000 from 22,329,800.
   Separately, Allegheny Ludlum said it agreed to acquire the
operating assets of Thinsheet Metals Co., a closely held
metals re-rolling concern with facilities in Waterbury, Conn.
The company has about 60 employees. Terms weren't disclosed.
The acquisition is expected to be completed later this
summer, the company said.
