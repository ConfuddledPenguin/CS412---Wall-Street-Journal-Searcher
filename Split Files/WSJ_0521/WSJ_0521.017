   Making book in Las Vegas isn't usually a literary pursuit.
But next month, the home of the Gamblers Book Shop will host
the annual convention of the American Booksellers
Association.
   Starting June 2, thousands of bookstore owners and
managers will arrive in Las Vegas, where several hundred
exhibiting publishers will give away books, buttons and
canvas bags to promote books coming out in the next year.
Such august authors as John Updike, Amy Tan and Isabel
Allende will sign autographs. In 90 years of conventions,
this will be the first time the booksellers have gathered in
Vegas, and frankly, some participants are shocked.

   But despite their highbrow image, many publishers are
scheduling appropriately tacky promotions. Take "The
Encyclopedia of Bad Taste," by Jane and Michael Stern. Harper
&amp; Row, the book's publisher, has ordered caterers to serve
tuna cassarole and spam sandwiches at its book party. Guests
will mingle with Dolly Parton and Pee Wee Herman look-alikes.
Naturally, there will be accordian music, plastic flamingos
and rubber chickens.
   Avon Books, a unit of Hearst Corp., plans a party honoring
author Johanna Lindsey, whose best-selling romance novels
include "Savage Thunder" and "Defy Not the Heart." Dinner
will be served at L'Amour Chapelle, a wedding chapel, and the
50 or so couples getting married that night will all troop
past the crowd of dining booksellers.
   One of the classiest publishers in the business, Random
House, is having a huge party at the only casino with its own
erupting volcano, the new Mirage. The book being celebrated
is Random House's biggest fall title, with a first printing
of 500,000 copies. "Trump: Surviving at the Top," by Donald
Trump, is the book.
   The list goes on: Viking, an imprint of Penguin USA, is
sponsoring a poker clinic with ace British poker player
Anthony Holden, author of a book called "Big Deal." St.
Martin's Press is holding a party for "The Caesar's Palace
Book of Sports Betting Strategies" at, of course, Caesar's
Palace. And Penguin, which is publishing the paperback
edition of "Liar's Poker," is holding a party where a musical
comedy version of the book about greedy, young bond traders
will be staged.
   "We'd have done something flashy for Liar's Poker
anywhere," says a Penguin publicist. "But being in Vegas
makes it easier to get in the mood."
