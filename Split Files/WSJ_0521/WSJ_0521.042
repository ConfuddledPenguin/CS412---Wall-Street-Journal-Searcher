   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Cerner Corp. said it agreed in
principle to buy, for $11 each, 505,662 of its common shares
held by First Chicago Capital Corp. and its affiliates.
   The maker of clinical information systems said it expects
to complete the repurchase of the 13.8% stake in about two
weeks.

   The First Chicago Corp. unit will finance one-half of the
buy-back over an 18-month period, Cerner said; the remainder
will be financed through a combination of operating funds and
Cerner's existing credit lines.
   Cerner said it has had "a long and outstanding
relationship with our venture capital partner," but
"Considering our strengthened cash flows and the long-term
potential for Cerner's products in the market place, we
believe that the opportunity to repurchase our stock at $11
per share represents a sound investment for Cerner."
