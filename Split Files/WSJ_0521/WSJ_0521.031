Master Animal Care operations to closely held Humboldt
Industries Inc.

   Master Animal Care sells pet supplies and accessories; an
official said the unit represented about 5% of Gander's
overall sales.
   Gander said the unit sale marks the final divestiture
under a previously announced company program to shed its
subsidiaries and focus on its "core" hunting, camping and
fishing supply sales.
