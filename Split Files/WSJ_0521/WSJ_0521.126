   A quasi-municipal utility proposed to buy some of the
assets of Arizona Public Service Co., the main unit of
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The proposal could throw a monkey
wrench into PacifiCorp's $1.82 billion offer for Pinnacle
West.
   Salt River Project, Arizona's second-largest electric
utility, proposed to pay as much as $500 million for certain
distribution and transmission facilities in the sprawling
Phoenix area. Arizona Public Service, the largest electric
utility in the state, serves the central parts of Phoenix and
other nearby cities; Salt River serves the surrounding area.
Under the Salt River proposal, roughly 166,000 customers of
Arizona Public Service would become customers of Salt River.

   The Salt River proposal came just one day after Pinnacle
West received a sweetened $1.82 billion acquisition offer for
the whole company from PacifiCorp, a Portland, Ore., utility
that has operations in seven states. Analysts said the
PacifiCorp offer would be hard to resist.
   But Salt River's proposal, apart from any financial
considerations, is a political wild card because it includes
a promise to freeze residential electricity rates for up to
seven years.
   "By serving our customers in more logical, contiguous
areas, we should be able to keep utility costs down and
improve service," said Jack Pfister, Salt River's general
manager. He said that Salt River's proposal, even though it
covers some of the oldest, highest-revenue producing parts of
Arizona Public Service's territory, shouldn't necessarily
preclude a sale of the rest of Pinnacle to PacifiCorp.
   Richard Snell, Pinnacle's chairman, reacted coolly to Salt
River's proposal. "I don't know why we would want to do this,
but we'll take a look at it." Mr. Snell said there were
"working meetings with financial advisors" over the weekend
to study both proposals. The Phoenix company's annual meeting
is Wednesday.
   Both Mr. Snell and Mr. Pfister denied that the Salt River
proposal was engineered as a more palatable alternative to
PacifiCorp's offer. Mr. Snell has said repeatedly that he
doesn't think this is the time to sell Pinnacle, which is
recovering from deep financial problems brought on by a
failed diversification strategy.
   A PacifiCorp spokesman said the company "hasn't done any
analysis and we don't know yet what {the Salt River proposal}
means." PacifiCorp's $21-a-share offer drops conditions that
made it easier for Pinnacle to reject its three previous
offers.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Pinnacle shares rose 12.5 cents to $16.50 on turnover of more
than two million shares. PacifiCorp shares closed at $22.25,
unchanged. The Salt River proposal came after the close of
trading.
   Salt River said it would pay 150% of book value for the
service areas, minus depreciation and amortization, up to
$500 million. Salt River estimates that the areas have a book
value of between $350 million and $380 million. PacifiCorp's
bid represents a "a little less than book value," Mr. Pfister
said. But he acknowledged that the proposals aren't directly
comparable. Salt River also said it would agree to purchase
power for the areas from Arizona Public Service at an
"attractive rate" for 20 years.
   Seeking customer support in the Arizona Public Service
service areas, Salt River has proposed a rate freeze there.
Arizona Public Service residential rates are now about 15%
higher than Salt River rates. If Salt River's proposal is
accepted, it promised that rates in the Arizona Public
Service areas wouldn't be raised, except to cover fuel
adjustments, until Salt River residential rates catch up in
about seven years.
   Late last week, PacifiCorp began running full-page ads in
Arizona newspapers highlighting its promise to limit
electricity price increases to 2% a year for the next four
years. Arizona Public Service had asked regulators for 6.5%
annual increases for three years beginning in 1991.
   The Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power
District isn't subject to regulation of the Arizona
Corporation Commission. Thus when the Salt River board
approved an average 7.9% rate rise last month for its
residential customers, its seventh rate increase since 1979,
no further action or review was necessary. Residential users
account for about 470,000 of the utility's 520,000 customers.
Arizona Public Service has a total of about 593,000
customers.
   After enjoying a booming business for decades, Salt River
has reduced projections for customer expansion because of
slowing growth of the Arizona economy. Salt River said that
if its bid is successful, it would end Salt River's
obligation to compensate some Arizona Public Service
customers who live within Salt River's waterservice area.
More than 50 years ago, a change in the Salt River bylaws
that has since been modified required the utility to pay
homeowners the difference between Salt River and Arizona
Public Service electric bills if the Arizona Public Service
bills are at least 15% higher. In 1987, Salt River paid out
$3.2 million to 13,100 Arizona Public Service customers and
the following year paid $2.6 million to 9,500 customers.
