   Corporate Capital Resources Inc., Westlake Village,
Calif., said the Securities and Exchange Commission has been
investigating the company since February for possibly
manipulating its stock price.
   Corporate Capital, a venture-capital firm, said the probe
relates to its lawsuit against Los Angeles-based Securities
Settlement Corp., a clearing broker. The suit alleges that
Securities Settlement manipulated Corporate Capital's stock
price, the company said.

   Corporate Capital said the SEC is looking into whether
Corporate Capital participated in that alleged manipulation
or others since September 1988.
   Securities Settlement officials couldn't be reached
immediately for comment.
   The SEC also is investigating whether Corporate Capital
misstated its investment holdings in its financial reports to
the agency, the company said.
   In an interview, Daniel Weston, Corporate Capital
president and chief executive officer, said: "We strongly
believe the results of the investigation will be favorable to
us and won't have any adverse effects on the company."
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Corporate
Capital's stock closed at 12.5 cents a share, down 3.125
cents.
