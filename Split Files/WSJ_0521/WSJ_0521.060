   MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS PLUS Inc. reduced its quarterly
dividend 50% to 10 cents a share from 20 cents, payable July
2 to stock of record June 1. The Newport Beach, Calif., real
estate trust, with assets concentrated in California
commercial real estate, said it cut the dividend because
Mortgage Investments' "environment has changed considerably
over the past several months." Funds resulting from the lower
dividend and from a cost-cutting program will be used to
reduce borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet, the
company said.
