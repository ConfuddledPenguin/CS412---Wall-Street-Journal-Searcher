   A Delaware court denied a request by investor Stanley
Stahl seeking to compel New York-based Apple Bancorp to hold
its 1990 meeting for shareholders on or before June 16.
   Mr. Stahl, who controls 31% of Apple's shares, is waging a
proxy fight to gain control of Apple's board. A New York
real-estate investor, Mr. Stahl has offered $38 a share, or
$121.6 million, for all of the bank's shares that he doesn't
own.

   Apple's board has rejected that offer as inadequate, and
investors apparently think either Mr. Stahl will sweeten his
offer, or another bidder will emerge. On Friday, Apple shares
closed at $44.625 a share, unchanged, in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Apple hasn't set a date for its annual meeting in order to
allow time to explore alternatives to Mr. Stahl's offer.
