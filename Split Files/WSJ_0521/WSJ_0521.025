   The `Green' Bandwagon
   Brings Ethical Choices

   MANAGERS at environmental groups wrestle with a new
problem: corporate donors.
   The question is: "How do you work with them without
getting co-opted?" asks Jack Murray, director of development
at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.
   In the past, corporate donors rarely sought out
environmental groups. But a growing "green" trend is pushing
companies to offer them everything from cash to
co-sponsorships.
   To guard itself, the Sierra Club in January adopted
guidelines that prohibit accepting gifts from such offenders
as "major polluters" or makers and vendors of environmentally
damaging products.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council recently sent back
an unsolicited $5,000 check from Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which
makes disposable diapers. "We aren't ruling out . . .
corporate contributions, nor are we condemning any company,"
says Paul Allen, an NRDC official. "But we don't want to take
contributions from people who are directly involved in
manufacturing -- particularly products that may potentially
have environmental consequences."
   (A Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman says: "We'll continue to
work with them and give them whatever support is appropriate
{but} we won't send them checks.")
   Not everyone is so standoffish. "I am a professional
fund-raiser," says Thomas Exton, a National Audubon Society
official. "When people say the money is tainted, I say
'tain't enough."
                                                                                                       

   Glass Ceiling Closes In
   At Business Schools
                                                                                                       

   THE RESIGNATION of Elizabeth Bailey as dean of Carnegie
Mellon University's business school, effective next month,
leaves only four female deans at accredited business schools,
and none at top-ranked schools. A few years ago, there were
as many as eight women deans at the 272 accredited schools,
says a spokesman at the American Assembly of Collegiate
Schools of Business.
   Dean Bailey, who declined to be interviewed, said through
a spokeswoman that women's issues weren't involved in her
resignation.
   Others, however, say women's issues can't help but be
involved. "Women business school deans are still an
endangered species," says Lynda Phillips-Madson, an associate
dean at Vanderbilt University's Owen School of Management.
"Regardless of the individual circumstances, I do see it as a
loss for women," she says, because the appointments are
critical for visibility.
   Eugene Rackley, a recruiter at Heidrick &amp; Struggles Inc.,
says the dean scarcity isn't for want of trying. "Every
search committee tries to go out of its way to generate as
many names {of women} as possible," he says, adding that the
pool of qualified candidates is "pretty small."
   Nonsense, retorts Anne Jardim, co-dean of Simmons
College's Graduate School of Management. "This is part of the
still-bigger problem of the situation of women in society."
   Other women cite school jitters. "Search committees just
don't want to take a chance on women," says Laurie Larwood,
business school dean at the State University of New York at
Albany. "They see it as a risk."
                                                                                                       

   When Group Leaders
   Aren't Group Members
                                                                                                       

   CAN AN OUTSIDER effectively lead a special-interest group?
   Yes, says Frank Stark, co-chairman of the Fund for Human
Dignity, a New York-based gay and lesbian group that just
appointed its first heterosexual executive director. "We were
looking for a manager," Mr. Stark says. Although nearly all
of the candidates were gay, the finalist, a former executive
with the National Conference of Christians and Jews, was "the
best person for the position."
   No, counters Mary Beth Caschetta, former coordinator of
the organization's crisis line, one of several staffers and
volunteers who resigned in protest. "A gay or lesbian person
can so much better understand, communicate and speak from the
heart about {gay} issues," she contends.
   Symbolism is crucial too, says Muriel H. Strassler, an
associate dean at Gallaudet University, a college for the
deaf, where student protests two years ago forced the
resignation of a hearing president in favor of a deaf one.
"For 125 years there had been no deaf person" in the top
spot, she says. "It was clearly discriminatory."
   Robert Brading, the new executive director at the gay
group, says he's confident he'll win support by doing his
job. "If the fund moves forward, the controversy will
lessen," he says.
   Still, James C. Newlan, Kentucky president of the National
Organization for Women, urges outsiders to be cautious. "You
are the one who is strange and different, not them," he says.
"You have to earn your acceptance."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   EMPLOYEES 'FESS UP to stealing: In a recent London House
Inc. survey, 43% of supermarket employees admitted some type
of theft of cash or property. The results, which were
anonymous, show "that people who steal perceive themselves as
average people in a dishonest world," the research firm says.
. . . Costly commercial space is shrinking executive offices,
says Orsini Design Associates, a New York interior design
firm. A typical office for an executive vice president once
was 15 by 20 feet. Today, it's more like 15 by 15. The
exception: chief executives and presidents. "They make up the
rules," says Susan Orsini, president.
