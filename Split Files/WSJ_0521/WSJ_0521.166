   WASHINGTON -- The Department of Veterans Affairs for the
first time acknowledged a link between cancer and exposure to
Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War, and
announced it will pay disability benefits to Vietnam veterans
with soft-tissue sarcomas.
   In March, the VA said it would grant disability benefits
to Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, another rare
cancer. It was the first time the government recognized a
connection between cancer and service in Southeast Asia. That
conclusion was based on a Centers for Disease Control study
that found a correlation between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
service in Vietnam.

   But the CDC study didn't find any connection betwen
exposure to Agent Orange and cancer. Veterans groups have
long contended that exposure to Agent Orange has led to a
higher incidence of cancer among Vietnam veterans, and in its
ruling Friday, the VA department conceded that there may be
such a connection.
   The latest decision rejects part of the CDC study, which
didn't find a link between service in Vietnam and five other
cancers, including soft-tissue sarcomas. But a VA advisory
committee reviewed scientific literature on the connection
between soft-tissue sarcomas and exposure to herbicides
containing dioxin and recommended that cancers be considered
service-connected and eligible for benefits.
   The ruling by VA Secretary Edward Derwinski means that
approximately 1,100 veterans or their survivors will qualify
for compensation. The department estimates it will recognize
an additional 50 new claims a year for soft-tissue sarcomas,
which are difficult-to-diagnose tumors found on muscles and
connective tissue or in body fat. The VA projects it will pay
about $8 million a year as a result of the decision.
