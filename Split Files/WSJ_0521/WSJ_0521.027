   Iowa State University said its biochemists have developed
a new vitamin Aderived ointment for common acne that lacks
the side effects of Johnson &amp; Johnson's widely used Retin-A
ointment.
   An Ames, Iowa, dermatologist who is conducting a small
clinical trial said that acne patients using the Iowa State
ointment haven't exhibited any of the skin redness and
peeling that has occurred in many acne patients using
Retin-A. "I think it has a beneficial effect, although it's
not quite as good as Retin-A," the dermatologist, Richard
Lloyd, said.

   But, Dr. Lloyd said, the new ointment's lack of side
effects indicates it could be used in patients who can't
tolerate Retin-A, particularly patients of light skin
complexion and patients who are sunburned.
   Dr. Lloyd said he also is testing the new ointment's
effects on skin wrinkles but results won't be known for
several months. Retin-A gained an unexpected boost in 1988
when the first of a series of research reports indicated it
can remove wrinkles. This use, however, hasn't yet been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
   A spokeswoman for Ortho Pharmaceutical, the J&amp;J unit that
markets Retin-A, said researchers there had heard of the Iowa
State compound but hadn't seen any clinical trial results.
   The Iowa State University Research Foundation in Ames is
offering to license the new ointment to manufacturers, a
spokesman, Steven Price, said. Ortho has no licensing plans
at present, the company's spokeswoman said.
   The new compound is technically known as
retinoyl-beta-glucuronide, or RBG. Like Retin-A, it is a
derivative of vitamin A, which is also known as retinoic
acid. RBG is present naturally in blood and various body
tissues. It was first found in rat tissues in 1966 by a
University of Florida team of biochemists that included James
Allen Olson. In the early 1980s, after Mr. Olson had moved to
Iowa State, a colleague, Arun B. Barua, developed a method of
making RBG synthetically. A more efficient process for making
RBG was developed last year.
   Laboratory tests indicate RBG is less toxic than Retin-A,
the university said. RBG "actively stimulates the growth of
vitamin A-depleted animals and the development of normal
tissue cells but doesn't show the toxicity of many other
forms of vitamin A," Mr. Olson said.
   Dr. Lloyd, the Ames dermatologist, said that seven months
ago he began a clinical trial involving 20 acne patients,
comparing an RBG ointment with Retin-A. The trial was
supposed to be "double-blind," in which neither the patients
nor Dr. Lloyd knew which ointment each patient was using.
   However, Dr. Lloyd said, he has been able to guess which
ointment some patients are using since they developed the
skin redness and scaling characteristic of Retin-A. A
statistical analysis of the results is now being made to see
how well RBG compares with Retin-A in treating acne, he said.
