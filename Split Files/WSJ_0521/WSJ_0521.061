   Like a growing number of U.S. women with breast cancer,
Mary Lupro is afraid she'll never receive a controversial new
treatment.
   Conventional chemotherapy seems to have arrested her
cancer, says the mother of two in Hanover, Pa. But before the
treatments, the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes in her
neck, a sign that it will probably recur in a deadlier,
metastatic form within a few years.

   Mrs. Lupro, 38 years old, believes a new treatment,
involving an "autologous bone marrow transplant," or ABMT,
could kill lingering tumor cells and buy her a lot of time.
But her health insurer, Travelers Corp., says the procedure
is still experimental, hence not covered. Without an
insurer's promise to pay, hospitals won't begin the costly
treatment, which employs a dangerous, high-dose blast of
conventional anti-cancer drugs.
   "I'm not as mad as my husband," says Mrs. Lupro, who says
she may sue Travelers to get an ABMT. "It's harder on him." A
Travelers spokeswoman says the Lupro case is "being reviewed
with an outside oncologist."
   The Lupros are caught up in one of the nation's fiercest
health-care debates. Preliminary studies on ABMT for breast
cancer indicate it may work better than conventional
alternatives for some women. A recent report in Tokyo showed
that about one-third of 258 metastatic breast-cancer patients
treated with ABMT after standard chemotherapy showed no signs
of the disease in follow-up periods of 12 to 42 months,
according to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which sponsored the
meeting.
   Karen Antman, a researcher at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston, told the meeting that the frequency of
tumor disappearance in certain patients is "much higher" than
with standard chemotherapy.
   But the treatment, which typically costs $100,000 or more,
is risky. About 9% of patients with various stages of breast
cancer have died from complications after the therapy,
according to Dr. Antman. Most doctors say that more data on
ABMT is needed to establish whether it's better than
alternative treatments.
   "I think the insurance companies are right. ABMT is very
experimental for breast cancer," says Subhash Gulati, chief
of the ABMT team at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. Still, he adds, early results with it are
"encouraging," warranting further studies.
   Some doctors are less optimistic. Based on available data,
"I certainly can't conclude that {breast-cancer} patients are
better off with ABMT," says David Eddy, a Duke University
health-policy professor and a consultant to the Blue Cross &amp;
Blue Shield Association.
   The stakes in the ABMT debate are large. The rate of
breast-cancer incidence in the U.S. has risen sharply in the
past decade, though the mortality rate has held steady. This
year, about 150,000 women will be diagnosed with the disease.
The metastatic form will develop in about 30% of those women,
with most patients dying within two years.
   Doctors testing ABMT for breast cancer estimate that
one-fourth to one-half of metastatic cases may be good
candidates for the procedure -- if it's proved effective.
Physicians also are testing ABMT to treat high-risk patients
before metastasis, as well as people with testicular cancer
and melanoma. For certain other cancers, such as leukemia,
ABMT already is an accepted treatment covered by insurers.
   "It's too early to say this approach is right for public
consumption," says Jacob Bitran, a University of Chicago
cancer researcher testing ABMT. "But I've never seen
metastatic breast cancer patients respond as frequently" as
they do with ABMT, he says.
   Its promise appears greatest with breast-cancer patients
whose cancers respond to conventional chemotherapy, says
Nancy Davidson, a Johns Hopkins University researcher. A
higher dose of the same drugs is likely to wipe out even more
breast cancer cells in those patients, she says, raising the
chances of long-term remission. But at high doses, the drugs
cripple the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to
fatal infections.
   To prevent that, doctors using ABMT extract marrow cells
from patients' pelvic bones through needles before giving
them anti-cancer drugs. The extracts contain immune-cell
precursors that, when reinfused after chemotherapy, "rescue"
patients' immune systems. Unlike conventional chemotherapy,
which requires shots over months or years, anti-cancer drugs
with ABMT are administered in intense doses over several
days.
   The procedure typically requires three or more weeks of
hospitalization for immune-system recovery. That's what makes
it so expensive. But the advent of "colony stimulating
factors" -- experimental drugs to speed immune-cell growth --
and other recent advances "are knocking four or five days
off" that period, says Chicago's Dr. Bitran. He estimates
that the procedure's costs now are "pretty close" to those of
a typical course of conventional chemotherapy for metastatic
breast cancer.
   The improvements also are narrowing patients' windows of
vulnerability to fatal infections, such as pneumonia. Deaths
from the treatment now occur in about 4% to 9% of patients
who are treated by doctors experienced with it, compared with
20% in one early study, says Andrew Dorr, a National Cancer
Institute researcher.
   Dr. Dorr adds that the NCI plans this fall to organize a
large clinical study of the new therapy and breast cancer.
But the study, which doctors agree is sorely needed, may
spark controversies of its own. One issue is whether insurers
should help pay for it.
   In any case, many women feel they don't have time to wait
for definitive studies. One is Pam Pirozzi, a 35-year-old
mother in Tracy's Landing, Md., diagnosed with breast cancer
last year. She sued her insurer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
Virginia, to force it to pay for an ABMT. Last month, a
federal judge in Alexandria, Va., ruled in her favor,
potentially setting an important precedent.
   But during her legal battle, says Mrs. Pirozzi, her cancer
spread to her cranium. Now she's undergoing conventional
therapy, hoping to follow it up with ABMT this fall.
