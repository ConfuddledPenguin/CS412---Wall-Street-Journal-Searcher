   CAMPEAU Corp. (Toronto) -- Gerard Coulombe, a Montreal
lawyer, was appointed a director of this real estate and
retailing concern, to serve as a National Bank of Canada
representative, succeeding Claude Ducharme. Harry Macdonnell,
an independent director appointed in February, resigned, and
a successor on the 12-member board is expected to be named
soon. Montreal-based National Bank obtained two Campeau board
seats in January after it seized certain Campeau securities
from Campeau Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert
Campeau as the result of defaults on about 153 million
Canadian dollars (US$130.4 million) of personal loans he owed
the bank; it agreed to return the securities to him on May 31
if he obtains financing to repay C$40 million of the loans.
He would then have until Jan. 31, 1992, to pay another C$40
million due to National Bank, or the bank will take back part
of the securities.
