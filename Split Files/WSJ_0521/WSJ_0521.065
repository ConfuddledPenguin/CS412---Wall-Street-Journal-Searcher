   KWANGJU, South Korea -- Anti-American protests in Korea
are a familiar sight and, as the strong protests over the
weekend proved, the problem isn't going away.
   All sorts of problems, including a weakening economy, the
unpopular creation of a consolidated conservative ruling
party and the continued division of Korea get blamed on the
U.S. "There is a tendency to associate the U.S. with anything
that goes wrong," says Donald C. Clarke, an American
professor teaching at Yonsei University in Seoul.

   U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg has set out to change that.
In a move that is controversial among his advisers and among
Korean dissidents, Mr. Gregg plans to pay a new visit to the
wellspring of anti-American feeling, the city of Kwangju.
   "We need to get a dialogue started in Kwangju," he says.
He is expected to make the trip next month when the U.S.
re-opens the American Cultural Center -- a lightning rod of
anti-American protests that has been firebombed 27 times.
   Anti-American feelings run deep in Kwangju because 10
years ago this week Korean troops killed hundreds of
civilians here after a protest against a military coup. The
U.S. did nothing.
   Some Koreans believe U.S. troops stationed in Korea should
have intervened to block the Korean troops. Some say the U.S.
should have used its influence with Korean military leaders
to stop them from using such deadly force. They say the U.S.
shouldn't have supported the dictatorship here.
   People in Kwangju, from radicals to the most moderate,
want an apology from the U.S. "If the U.S. would just reveal
the truth, we would forgive very easily," says Kim Chung Ho,
an elderly teacher attending a massive rally on a downtown
Kwangju street Friday.
   The U.S. won't apologize. So the stalemate breeds more
anti-American feeling. "The explosion of Kwangju exposed the
U.S. tactics," says Kim Hong Myong, dean of academic affairs
at Chosun University in Kwangju, repeating the commonly held
belief that the U.S. conspired in various ways to take
advantage of Korea. "Now Koreans are extreme in seeing the
negative side, without seeing the positive things," he says.
   The anger is intense in Kwangju. Posters use a very
derogative term for American. Murals show naked prostitutes
shielded by the U.S. flag.
   Ambassador Gregg made his first attempt to repair the
damage in a visit to Kwangju last January. "The Kwangju
problem was left unaddressed," says Mr. Gregg. "People never
had an answer to their questions for 10 years and it was
still burning in their gut."
   His trip got lukewarm reviews, but almost all Koreans
praised him for being the first to make an attempt. "At least
it was an effort," says Archbishop Victorinus Youn. "It was a
sincere effort."
   Many people refused to meet with Mr. Gregg. The Archbishop
says he didn't meet with Mr. Gregg because of a scheduling
problem. Others refused on political grounds and then put
extreme pressure on anyone who wanted to meet him. Ahn Kil
Hyun, the editor of a college newspaper, met Mr. Gregg, was
impressed, but then kept the meeting secret from his
classmates. "At school there are a lot of extremists. I
didn't want the newspaper to be attacked."
   The first trip caused Mr. Gregg to change his own opinion.
He began by saying the U.S. had nothing to apologize for. But
after hours of talks with city leaders, dissidents and
students, he told himself, "We do have something to apologize
for. For being silent for 10 years and allowing this to
fester."
