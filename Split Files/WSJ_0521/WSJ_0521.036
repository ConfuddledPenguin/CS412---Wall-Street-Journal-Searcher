   TOKYO -- Ryoei Saito isn't easily fazed.
   The bluff, 74-year-old tycoon who stunned the world art
market last week by paying $160.6 million for two paintings
expects criticism for his extravagance. But the prospect
doesn't seem to bother him. "It's my policy to get what I
want, no matter how much money I have to pile up," he boasted
to Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper. "Both were wonderful
paintings, and once it's in an auction, somebody's going to
get it. I thought . . . that I'd be the one."

   Even paying $33 million more than he expected last Tuesday
to acquire Vincent van Gogh's haunting "Portrait of Dr.
Gachet" for a record $82.5 million didn't deter Mr. Saito
from spending another $78.1 million two days later for Pierre
Auguste Renoir's bright "Au Moulin de la Galette."
   But Mr. Saito's generosity last week with the New York
auction houses, where he was represented by Tokyo's Kobayashi
Gallery -- is a trait that has caused him trouble in the
past.
   Local magazines dub him "the wild man of Tokai," his
region of Japan, for the tyrannical way he's run the family
business, Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., Japan's
second-biggest paper concern.
   He packed the company's board with relatives. He installed
two of his brothers as company president, and fired one of
them. Four of his sons have worked at the company. He is
accused by critics of treating the company's money as his
own; even today, Daishowa officials say they don't know if
Mr. Saito, now chairman emeritus, used his own money or
company money to buy the paintings in New York. (Mr. Saito
tells reporters that he borrowed the money against his land
holdings.)
   So aggressive was Mr. Saito with Daishowa's money a decade
ago that he temporarily lost control of the company. After a
ferocious investment binge bloated the company's debt,
Daishowa was forced to cede some management control to its
biggest bank, Sumitomo Bank Ltd., in 1982. Mr. Saito even was
forced by the bank to sell off an earlier art collection and
other assets valued at more than $1 billion. After the
company's finances stabilized in 1983, Mr. Saito resumed
control -- and says he severed ties with Sumitomo. Sumitomo
officials were unavailable for comment over the weekend, but
the bank still holds a 4.1% stake in Daishowa.
   Mr. Saito has splashed his wealth around before. He is the
chief benefactor of the public art museum in Shizuoka, his
home prefecture. He has fed speculation that the museum will
house his newly acquired works, although he says the
facilities may need to be improved to house world-class art.
But officials at the museum, which has about 80 Western
paintings, most of them small works, as well as about 1,200
Japanese paintings and some sculptures, were cautious, saying
they hadn't yet been offered the paintings officially.
   Every year when he pays his national income taxes, Mr.
Saito breaks into the top 50 taxpayers in the land. He says
he's proud to be on the list so people will know how
successful he has been.
   With the acquisition of the world's two most-expensive
paintings, he knows he's flaunting his wealth in a sensitive
area. Foreign reaction has been sharp toward Japanese
purchases of Western cultural symbols.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Saito told the Associated Press, "I'm
not concerned, because this is all one big world."
