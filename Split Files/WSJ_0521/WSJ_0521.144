   Public corporations that pay to get their annual reports
distributed may be victims of a scam.
   A federal grand jury in Cleveland last week charged
William R. Wood and Dennis A. O'Rourke, both of Lakewood,
Ohio, with using the mail system to defraud companies in the
U.S. and Canada. Postal authorities say the scheme may have
involved as many as 1,500 public corporations that
collectively paid an estimated $50,000.

   Between March 1988 and June 1989, according to the
indictment, Messrs. Wood and O'Rourke allegedly used a post
office box, a mail drop and a telephone answering service to
operate a simple but effective false-billing scheme.
   Under New York Stock Exchange rules, publicly traded
companies are required to give financial reports to companies
representing shareholders, and to reimburse those companies
for distributing the reports.
   According to the indictment, Messrs. Wood and O'Rourke
requested financial reports from companies using a variety of
official-sounding names, including W.M.F. Financial Corp.,
Wood Meade Funds, Guardian Asset Fund Inc., and Magna
Investments Inc.
   The two men then billed the victim corporations between
$15 and $50 each for distributing the reports. But as Postal
Inspector Michael D. Sitter in Cleveland points out, "Not
only were they a business not authorized to do business, they
were not actually providing the service." Because the
invoices looked legitimate, and because the fees were
relatively nominal, most target companies paid the phony
bills.
   Last May, after an investigation, U.S. postal inspectors
began collecting mail addressed to the phony companies and
subsequently issued a cease-and-desist order. Mr. Wood has
told the U.S. Postal Inspection Service that he is not the
Wood in Wood Meade Funds. Neither Mr. Wood nor Mr. O'Rourke
could be reached for comment.
   "They haven't got all {these phony companies,} because I
just got another one in the mail, this one from Brooklyn,"
says Richard Odlin, vice president at Puget Sound Bancorp in
Washington state. Last year, Mr. Odlin tipped the post office
off to the Wood Meade Funds scheme in a letter in which he
chronicled his experience with the company. His suspicion was
aroused, oddly enough, by a 1977 Wall Street Journal article
outlining a fraudulent billing scheme for annual reports.
"But we never did get our $15 back," says Mr. Odlin.
   If convicted on charges of criminal mail fraud, each
defendant faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal
prison and a $250,000 fine.
