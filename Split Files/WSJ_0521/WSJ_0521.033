   MELBOURNE, Fla. -- Harris Corp. says it has achieved
sharply higher yields in its semiconductor plants by using a
production control system developed with Digital Equipment
Corp. and a Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman Inc. unit.
   Manufacturing yield is a major problem in chip making,
where typical yields range from 99%, to as low as 35%, for
each wafer of silicon, depending on the complexity of the
chip. Harris said it has produced yield improvements of
between 17% to 50%.

   Digital, Maynard, Mass., and BBN, of Cambridge, Mass., are
in discussions with Harris to commercialize the jointly
developed software. Randy Burdick, director of manufacturing
systems at Harris, says that other chip makers have expressed
interest in the system, which he said could yield "huge
savings for the industry."
