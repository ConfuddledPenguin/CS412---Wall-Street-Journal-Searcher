   NEW YORK -- Embattled Lionel Corp. posted a wider fiscal
first-quarter loss, citing higher expenses associated with
new stores opened late last year and lower existing-store
sales.
   The loss in the quarter ended April 28 was $6 million, or
44 cents a share, vs. $3.6 million, or 27 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales grew 7.5% to $65.9 million from $61.3
million.

   Lionel, which currently operates 92 toy stores in 15
states, said it plans to open 10 stores in major metropolitan
markets in 1990.
   The company has been under pressure from some shareholders
to find a buyer. Earlier this year it turned down investor
Robert I. Toussie's $8-a-share, or $95.4 million, offer and
got him to drop the proposal. The stock since then has been
trading well below that level.
   Trendex Capital Management Corp., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
firm representing a dissident group of Lionel shareholders
with a 5% stake, has requested that Lionel clear the way for
would-be acquirers. It also asked Lionel to empanel an
outside committee to examine Lionel's relationship with Isaac
Perlmutter and Bernard Marden.
   Messrs. Perlmutter and Marden are principals in a
media-buying company that has Lionel as a client, and Lionel
has purchased toy inventory from companies controlled by
them. Mr. Marden provided the cash for Otis Group Inc., a
newly formed entity, to buy half of Mr. Toussie's 9.9% Lionel
stake for $7 a share the day Mr. Toussie dropped his bid.
   Lionel has refused Trendex's requests and has declined to
meet with Trendex, calling the firm "a disgruntled,
uninformed risk-arbitrager." As for any link with between
Otis and "any entities with which Lionel does business,"
Lionel told Trendex it knows of none, adding that it is
cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation of the Otis stock purchase.
   Trendex, however, has provided Lionel with stock-trade
records showing that Mr. Marden provided the capital for
Otis. The investment firm said Lionel has agreed to
reconsider its requests at a future board meeting.
