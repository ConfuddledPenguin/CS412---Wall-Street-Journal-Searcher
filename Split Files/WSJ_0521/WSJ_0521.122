   Axa-Midi Assurances said it sold its 92% holding in a
Paris-based warehouse company to La Societe Magnant S.A. for
the equivalent of $731 a share, or $575 million.
   The warehouse company, Cie. des Entrepots &amp; Magasins
Generaux, is traded on the Paris Bourse.

   The sale price is almost twice the $296.5 million value
estimated by an independent appraiser in Axa-Midi's
application earlier this year to purchase Farmers Insurance
Group, Axa-Midi said. The sale of Farmers Insurance to
Axa-Midi was proposed by Sir James Goldsmith as part of his
$21 billion bid for B.A.T Industries PLC. California
insurance authorities rejected the sale of Farmers, saying
the leverage required would have endangered Farmers.
   Axa Midi, Europe's seventh largest insurance company, said
it continues to look for a U.S. insurance company to buy.
