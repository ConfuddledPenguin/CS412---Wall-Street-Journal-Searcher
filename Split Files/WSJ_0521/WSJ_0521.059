   The tendency of Japanese companies to take advantage of
innovations devised in the U.S. is almost automatically
attributed to Japan's lower capital costs and its supportive
government-industry alliances. But it's often overlooked that
from the very start U.S. corporations put their emerging
technologies at an enormous disadvantage because of the
techniques they use to evaluate payoffs. The rigid equations
and models currently used unfortunately have replaced the
instinct and intuition that once guided U.S entrepreneurs.
   The fundamental test used in most U.S. companies is: Does
the return exceed the cost of capital over the life of the
project? To find the answer companies subject the project to
a variety of discounted-cash flow measures.

   Dozens of assumptions go into this methodological
overkill. Many of the assumptions aren't reliable. Some are
tenuous at best. And if it's a long-term project that would
take, say, 10 years to commercialize (five years being the
outer limits of American corporations' horizon), the distant
estimates are considered highly speculative and are heavily
discounted. Even the "terminal value," the value of the plant
and other assets upon commercialization, is assumed to be
zero. When all is said and done, the payoff estimates
produced by the quantitative analyses are usually too low.
They stand little chance of beating that ultimate yardstick
--  the cost of capital. Nine out of 10 projects, on average,
fail the test.
   Perhaps the most fundamental problem with the current
techniques is that they fail to take into account the
consequences of not pursuing a technology. An auto maker may
give up on ceramic engines, because technically they seem
unfeasible. But a rival who makes prosaic ceramic parts with
the aim of one day using the knowledge to build a ceramic
engine -- as the Japanese are doing -- can quickly change the
competitive balance.
   How to get American companies to act on their intuition
again? There is a new technique that will go a long way
toward that. It deserves wide attention, for it comes closest
to simulating the old-fashioned gut feeling.
   Designed after well-developed stock-options theories, the
technique works something like this: Suppose there are two
emerging technologies, X and Y, that have some bearing on the
company's main business. The X may involve a well-understood
technology and a market. The Y may involve a wide range of
possible outcomes and new markets but with, say, 40% chance
of technical failure. The benefits of X are easily
quantifiable, and hence salable to top management for
funding. The Y is unsalable because it's unquantifiable, even
though it seems more promising.
   Instead of ignoring Y, the company commits small amounts
to develop the technology, in effect taking a "call option"
on the underlying technology. The option allows R&amp;D people to
explore its technical possibilities, market opportunities,
development costs and competitors' strategies. If these don't
become clear within the time period of the option, the option
is allowed to "expire."
   The loss is limited to the small initial funding (the
value of the R&amp;D option), just as in the stock option. "The
important thing to realize is that the initial expenditures
are not directed so much as an investment as they are toward
creating an option," says William Hamilton of the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, who has co-authored a paper
on options valuations of R&amp;D with Graham Mitchell, director
of planning at GTE Laboratories in Waltham, Mass.
   R&amp;D options, fundamentally, help identify the unapparent
outcomes that may be the most important reasons for
undertaking the investment. Consider:
   -- In 1984, W.R. Grace decided to invest in a new
technology for catalytic converters for the automobile
aftermarket. The discounted-cash-flow analysis -- which used
a generous "terminal" value -- showed that it was an
"attractive" project. What looked like a sure-fire technology
now can't compete on price. "We didn't accurately predict the
price-performance requirement we needed in the aftermarket,"
says Peter Boer, chief technical officer.
   Grace would have dropped the project, except that other
opportunities for that technology intervened. The recent
clean-air legislation has created applications in
cogeneration plants, in planes to reduce ozone emissions, and
in utilities to control emissions. Suppose the automotive
catalyst technology had been given a thumbs-down by the
quantitative techniques, but the other downstream markets
loomed on the horizon. Could Grace have overturned the
negative signal and invested in the automotive catalyst
anyway? "I don't think I would have been able to communicate
that to the finance people," says Mr. Boer.
   -- In the early 1980s, General Electric initially ignored
the emerging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology for
medical diagnosis. The MRI market was unclear. And most
important, it would have cannibalized the market for GE's
existing CT diagnostic machine, which uses X-rays. GE
overruled the directive of the discounted-cash-flow
technique, as it realized that if it didn't cannibalize the
CT market, someone else was going to. Walter Robb, director
of GE's R&amp;D, says he doesn't have much use for quantitative
techniques now. "The challenge is to find 30 projects a year
that will pay off not by NPV (net present value) but by the
seat of our pants," he says.
   -- It's the downstream rewards that are allowing the
pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co. to plan extensive
automation. When it considered the idea first for a drug
packaging and distribution plant, the labor savings didn't
justify the investment. Moreover, with no prior experience
with robots, Merck also wasn't certain about the technical
success.
   "It was a tricky thing to convince the management. But
options valuation allowed engineers to articulate a whole
range of outcomes and their benefits," says Judy Lewent,
chief financial officer at Merck. The management agreed to
take an "option" on automating the plant, and results from
the pilot project since early this year have clarified the
potential future benefits to the point that the company is
now willing to expand automation to its diverse manufacturing
operations.
   -- U S West, a telecommunications concern in Denver, faced
with fast-changing technologies in its industry, also has
taken the options approach. It's pursuing technologies --
that it otherwise wouldn't be able to justify -- aimed at
making its cellular phones and paging devices more
user-friendly. "Our company doesn't have the maturity and
experience to act on gut feelings," says David Sena,
strategic technology planner of U S. West, a company spawned
in 1984 by the AT&amp;T breakup.
   The options technique needs refining (how to calculate the
value of an R&amp;D option is a subject of debate, for instance).
But it is the first clear mechanism for R&amp;D people to
communicate with their finance men.
