   Warren E. Weber's otherwise excellent editorial-page
article, "America's Own Fixed-Exchange Model," April 26, has
the defect that it fosters confusion between two
fundamentally different monetary systems: a unified currency
and a system of national currencies linked to one another at
pegged exchange rates.
   A unified currency may have different names in different
places: during the heyday of the gold standard, a pound in
Britain, a dollar in the U.S.; currently, in the example used
by Mr. Weber, an A dollar, a B dollar for dollars issued by
different Federal Reserve districts.

   The key feature that defines a unified currency is that
there is either no (the gold standard) or at most one (the
U.S. today) monetary authority authorized to issue fiat money
-- that is the translation of Mr. Weber's requirement that
there be "an agreement among countries about the amount of
seigniorage and its distribution." Stated differently, for a
fiat currency to be unified, there must be only one central
bank, though it can have any number of branches -- the U.S.
Federal Reserve System has 12. That requirement is easy to
state; it is exceedingly difficult to achieve on a world
scale. We shall, I predict, wait a long time before the U.S.,
Britain, Germany, France and Japan are all willing to convert
their national central banks into branches of a world central
bank -- and, I may say, as a U.S. citizen, I would be
extremely opposed to doing so.
   In the absence of the effective elimination of national
central banks, any "agreement among countries about the
amount of seigniorage and its distribution" will degenerate
into a Bretton Woods-pegged exchange-rate system, which would
inevitably break down as Bretton Woods did.
   Incidentally, a unified currency does not require or
involve literally fixed exchange rates. Before the Federal
Reserve System was established, the U.S. had a unified
currency internally, yet there was a market in St. Louis, to
take one example, for "New York dollars." The only reason
such markets do not exist currently is because the Federal
Reserve (i.e., the taxpayer) pays the transactions costs for
regional transfers of funds. Similarly, during the
gold-standard period, the exchange rate between the British
pound and the U.S. dollar varied within a range, the limits
of which were set by the costs of transporting gold to or
from Britain.
   A unified currency has many desirable features, but is not
at present a feasible alternative on any world-wide basis. A
system of national currencies linked by pegged exchange rates
has many undesirable features, yet it is a far more feasible
option under current circumstances.
