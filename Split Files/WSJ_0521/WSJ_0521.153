   PITTSBURGH -- Mellon Bank Corp. said it completed the
purchase of 54 branch offices in the Philadelphia area from
Meritor Savings Bank for about $335 million.
   Under the agreement, Mellon assumed deposits of about $5.2
billion and acquired assets of approximately $4.9 billion.

   Mellon, a bank holding company, said it will finance the
transaction by using the proceeds from its recent Series H
preferred stock issuance and by applying proceeds from the
sale of its Mellon Financial Services, a Chicago-based
consumer finance business. That sale is expected to close in
June 1990.
