   The Census Bureau can't explain the low rate of census
forms that have been filled out and returned; it's about 75%
nationwide, down from nearly 90% a decade ago. Some say it's
apathy, but we say it was a marketing error. The Census
Bureau warned in grave tones that if people failed to return
their forms, they could lose congressional representation.
What a brier patch. The prospect of fewer congressional seats
might seem like an even better alternative than the proposed
12-year-term limitation for Congressmen.
