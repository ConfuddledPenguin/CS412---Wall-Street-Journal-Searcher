   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to notify
Congress this week that he is renewing China's
most-favored-nation trade status for a year, administration
officials said.
   The notification is likely to be accompanied by a
declaration that the trade status, which entitles China to
the same treatment as most American trading partners, could
be revoked if the U.S. remains unsatisfied with China's human
rights performance, the officials said. The precise
formulation of the administration's position is being
discussed privately with congressional leaders, the officials
added.

   Renewal of China's most-favored-nation status is likely to
be controversial in Congress, where there has been strong
criticism both of China's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators and of President Bush's low-key reaction to it.
   But it appears doubtful that there will be the two-thirds
majority of lawmakers required to block the move. Even some
members who have urged Mr. Bush to be tougher on China don't
object to continuing most-favored nation trade status, both
because U.S. companies have been campaigning intensely in
favor of extending the trade status and because a decision to
rescind it might harm the Hong Kong economy.
   Mr. Bush is legally required to decide before June 3
whether to renew China's most-favored nation status. Congress
could pass a resolution blocking the president's decision to
grant the status. But Mr. Bush then could veto the
resolution, and Congress would need a two-thirds majority in
both houses to override the veto.
   Officials said the administration has concluded that it
would be politically wiser to notify Congress this week of
the president's decision, before lawmakers leave town for a
Memorial Day recess. Administration aides are grateful that
some key lawmakers, such as Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.),
chairman of the House Asian affairs subcommittee, have said
they wouldn't object to extension of most-favored status for
China despite their unhappiness with the administration's
overall strategy. But Rep. Solarz has said that in making an
extension, the U.S. should state that further renewals will
depend on China's making progress on human rights. The
administration doesn't want to offend such potential
supporters by announcing the president's decision while
lawmakers are away from Washington on a recess.
   The administration also may find it politically wiser to
dispose of the issue before the June 4 first anniversary of
China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing.
   Mr. Bush and his top aides have been having almost daily
discussions in recent weeks on how to handle the decision on
China's trade status, administration officials said. Mr. Bush
hinted at a news conference last week that he was inclined to
renew China's most-favored-nation status. Noting that even
some of the harshest critics of his China policy nevertheless
come down in favor of renewing China's trade status, Mr. Bush
noted: "I still am of the mind that having contact and
working in an area where there has been progress -- on the
economic side -- with China is important."
   Some critics are sure to complain that a continuation of
most-favored-nation status will send Beijing a harmful signal
regarding U.S. concern about human-rights abuses there. But
U.S. companies that import goods from China have been warning
that if most-favored-nation status is lifted, some import
duties would rocket.
   In addition, the conservative Heritage Foundation said in
a recent paper that about 65% of China's exports to the U.S.
first go to Hong Kong for packaging and shipping, meaning
that Hong Kong's economy would be hard-hit if China's trade
status were downgraded.
