   Alps Electric Co., one of Japan's leading electronic parts
manufacturers, posted a 64.3% gain in unconsolidated pretax
profit for the fiscal year ended March 31.
   Pretax profit swelled to 11.98 billion yen ($78.7 million)
in fiscal 1989, compared with 7.29 billion yen the year
before, as a 2.3% rise in total sales boosted operating
profit, the company said. Operating profit surged 80.9% to
11.99 billion yen from 6.63 billion yen.

   But net income rose only 0.1% to 6.073 billion yen from
6.065 billion yen, largely because in fiscal 1988,
extraordinary profits helped boost otherwise weak net
earnings. Extraordinary profits fell 49.5% in fiscal 1989 to
2.24 billion yen from 4.43 billion yen the year before.
   Overall sales reached 313.96 billion yen in fiscal 1989,
up from 306.93 billion yen the year before. Company officials
cited booming demand for components of compact disc players,
car stereos and radio cassette stereos. However, with
increased overseas production of color television sets and
videocassette recorders, parts sales in this category were
significantly lower.
