   Compaq Computer Corp. said it will introduce today a new
line of personal computers that have built-in networking
features.
   Dubbed the Deskpro 286N and Deskpro 386N, the new PCs are
about half the height of Compaq's current desk-top units and
come with extensive hardware and software security features.
Suggested resale prices for the Deskpro 286N start at $1,699
and for the 386N at $2,299.

   Price competition is a major reason for the Compaq
introduction: many customers for Compaq's top-of-the-line
file servers -- powerful PCs that can process information
simultaneously for dozens of terminals -- were buying rivals'
desk-top units, according to Michael Swavely, president of
the Houston-based company's North American operations. At the
same time, he added, networked systems are becoming the major
PC growth area of the 1990s.
