   WASHINGTON -- More than half the banks in a new Federal
Reserve survey said they have tightened their standards for
lending to medium-sized and small businesses out of concern
over the health of the economy and their own loan portfolios.
   Meanwhile, the Fed disclosed that widespread complaints
about a credit crunch contributed to its decision not to
raise interest rates when the central bank's policy-making
committee met in late March.

   The survey found that banks have not only raised their
standards for accepting loan applications but "have recently
tightened the terms on loans they are currently willing to
make." Approximately 30% of the banks surveyed said that in
about the past six months, they had reduced the size of
credit lines to businesses with annual sales between $50
million and $250 million.
   Growth in business loans virtually ceased in 1989, the
survey said. The banks cited reduced demand for credit almost
as frequently as tighter credit terms and standards.
   "Banks with assets below $10 billion showed much more
inclination to tighten than did very large banks," the survey
said.
   The credit pinch is most severe in real estate lending.
About 80% of the banks responding said they have strengthened
their lending standards for commercial office buildings, many
"considerably," it said.
   But the tightening doesn't appear to be affecting consumer
credit nearly as much. Banks seem to be more willing to make
consumer installment loans, though there is little evidence
of continued growth in other consumer lending, such as home
equity loans, the survey said.
   Reports of a credit crunch have worried some economists,
who fear that the economy could slow severely, even topple
into a recession, if lending becomes too constrained. But it
has been difficult to tell just how serious the squeeze is.
   The Fed has been trying to combat the notion that there is
a credit crunch. But anecdotal evidence of a credit squeeze
figured in the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting of March
27, at which members voted 9-2 to hold interest rates steady
despite indications of a strengthening economy and mounting
inflationary pressures, according to a summary of the closed
meeting released Friday. Some members argued that "the
apparent tightening of credit standards," along with the
strength of the dollar and slowing growth in the money
supply, were braking the economy as much as a "modest"
tightening by the Fed.
   Despite reports of reduced construction, auto and home
equity credit, the Fed policy makers noted little evidence of
a credit crunch in aggregate financial statistics. Some
committee members said stricter credit standards were
probably "a desirable development" given slower economic
activity and the lending excesses of a few years ago. But a
number of members "expressed concern that significant further
restraint on credit availability, should it occur, could have
adverse consequences for the overall economy," the summary
said.
   Two committee members, Robert Boykin, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Lee Hoskins, president of
the Cleveland Fed, dissented in favor of tighter policy
because of their concerns about inflation.
   The committee met again last week to set policy for the
next six weeks. It won't disclose last week's decisions until
early July, but Edward Boehne, president of the Philadelphia
Fed, said last week that the Fed hasn't changed monetary
policy since right before Christmas. Moreover, the Fed has
given no sign in financial markets that it has altered its
policy. Recent reports have indicated that both the economy
and inflationary pressure may be weaker than previously
thought.
   The summary also shows that some Fed policy makers are
still uneasy about the Treasury's willingness to intervene in
foreign exchange markets.
   Three committee members, Mr. Hoskins and Fed Govs. Wayne
Angell and John LaWare, dissented in what normally is a
routine vote to raise the limit on Fed holdings of foreign
currencies. Mr. Angell and Mr. Hoskins expressed concern that
intervention over the past year "had undermined the
credibility" of Fed monetary policy by contributing to
uncertainty over the central bank's priority toward battling
inflation. Mr. LaWare argued that too frequent intervention
makes the tactic less effective when it's needed to calm
disorderly markets.
