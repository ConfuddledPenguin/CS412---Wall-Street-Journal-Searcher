   HAMILTON, Ontario -- Stelco Inc. said it formed a joint
venture with Mitsubishi Corp.'s Canadian unit to build a 200
million Canadian dollar (US$170.2 million) steel coating
plant.
   Robert Milbourne, vice president of manufacturing at
Stelco's steel division said Mitsubishi would hold a 40%
equity interest in the operation, known as the Z-Line. Stelco
will hold the remaining 60% equity stake.

   Mr. Milbourne said a "substantial portion" of the
project's cost will be financed through debt. He declined to
be more specific, or to say what portion of the debt would be
held by the two companies.
   Stelco is saddled with C$860 million in long-term debt;
the company said previously that it may have to rely on banks
to get it through its "temporary cash situation."
   Mr. Milbourne said Stelco's "investment will be
significantly limited" because of Mitsubishi's involvement.
   The Z-Line facility is already under construction; it is
expected to begin operation in December. The line will be the
first in Canada that can supply up to 72-inch wide galvanized
steel for use primarily by automotive companies.
   Mr. Milbourne said the project could face delays as a
result of the current construction workers' strike in
Ontario. The company also faces a possible strike with its
own workers this summer because its collective agreement with
10,000 workers expires July 31.
