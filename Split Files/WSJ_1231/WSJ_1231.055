   Heifer Project International has perhaps the only funny
name in the serious business of hunger relief. It makes some
people smile in a puzzled way, then ask: "Heifer? Like in
cow?"
   Precisely.

   The oddly but aptly named Arkansas-based organization has
fought against hunger and poverty for almost 50 years by
giving livestock and training to the rural poor in 33 states
and more than 110 countries. Heifer Project started during
the Spanish Civil War with an Indiana farmboy turned church
youth worker. Dan West's volunteer job was to pass out
powdered milk to refugees. There was never enough. Mr. West
decided that the fight against hunger would be more effective
if the refugee families were given a food source rather than
foodstuffs. Very quickly, Mr. West's endeavor had its first
slogan: "Not a Cup but a Cow."
   Before the first shipment of 19 heifers had left the
Southeastern U.S. in 1944 en route to impoverished Puerto
Rican families, Mr. West decided that the cows should be
pregnant, and that each recipient should agree to "pass on"
the first-born female offspring to another needy family. This
philosophy has remained at the core of Heifer Project's work;
only the range of animals provided has changed over the
years. This year, Heifer Project was honored with a
Presidential End Hunger Award on World Food Day, Oct. 16. Out
of eight honorees, it was the only private voluntary
organization.
   About half of Heifer Project's 1990 income of about $8
million came from churches or church members. A Sunday school
class or congregation might collect the $500 it takes to buy
a cow for a needy family. A quarter of Heifer Project's
income comes from foundations, corporations and government
grants. The rest comes from individuals. At Living Gift
Markets, some people contribute the amount they normally
would spend on holiday gifts to Heifer Project and send out
cards saying that ". . . instead of a gift, a cow has been
purchased in your name." There's even a Heifer Project
International gift catalog.
   Thanks to Vermont cow artist Woody Jackson, Heifer Project
raises some funding and some eyebrows with wild red-and-green
T-shirts bearing black-and-white cows and the slogan "Give
Milk to the World" emblazoned across the chest, right above
bra level for some.
   Speaking of wild, the first totally WiLD conference (Women
in Livestock Development) premiered this past spring at
Heifer Project's ranch in Arkansas. The WiLD women were
village leaders, university instructors, relief-agency
workers and farmers. They were from Kenya to Kentucky, from
China to Maine. In addition to receiving classroom and field
training, these women were feted by first-lady Hillary
Clinton at the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock and were
wined and dined by Winthrop and Lisenne Rockefeller at their
home on Petit Jean Mountain, overlooking the Heifer Project's
1,200-acre ranch and learning center in the valley below.
   Some WiLD conferees stayed on for the annual Institute for
Livestock Development. With their male colleagues, the women
studied farm methods as diverse as the zero grazing system
(dairy animals are confined to stalls, where the pasture is
brought to the animals -- thus overcoming erosion caused by
overgrazing and providing a way to keep the valuable manure
in one place) to advanced systems in how to breed fish.
   Yes, that's right -- fish. While cows remain central, the
organization deals in other livestock and such hoofless food
sources as fish and poultry. In 1989, Heifer Project dealt in
cattle, goats, water buffalo, yaks, swine, rabbits, sheep,
poultry, fish and honeybees. One hundred and sixty new yaks
were distributed in China. More than 25,000 new fish were
distributed in the U.S., Canada, Indonesia and the
Philippines. Four hundred fish were "passed on" to repay a
loan in Thailand. Last year, Heifer Project dealt in new
honeybees in India, and in Mexico, bees were "passed on."
   In Massachusetts, Northeast director Rosalee Sinn
overlooks the rolling acres of a Heifer Project farm and
recounts by phone her recent trip to China. "I visited
projects where Chinese who have trained here at Overlook Farm
are working," she says. Ms. Sinn, an internationally
recognized expert on goats who waxes eloquent on the relative
merits of goat vs. cow milk, is particularly impressed with
the results that Heifer Project is having with yaks. "The
best yogurt I've ever eaten," she says, "was made from yak
milk in China." She delights in the crossbreeding of yaks
with Holsteins, resulting in an animal that produces two
gallons of milk a day.
   Holy cow indeed, Heifer Project. Give milk to the world.
