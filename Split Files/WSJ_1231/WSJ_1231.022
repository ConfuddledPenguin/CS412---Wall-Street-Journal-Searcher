   Advertising executives are out of work in record numbers,
thanks to the recession plaguing the media business. But amid
the flying pink slips, one area appears less vulnerable: the
legal department.
   Many ad officials say lawyers are the hottest commodity on
Madison Avenue. New attention is being given to legal
matters, they say, in large part because of a more aggressive
Federal Trade Commission. Crucial legal issues these days
involve the advertising production process and whether
agencies can properly substantiate the claims made in ads.

   Earlier this month, for the first time in many years, the
FTC charged an ad agency for its part in what the FTC called
deceptive advertising. Before that, ad officials were shaken
by the Volvo disaster, in which Scali, McCabe, Sloves
resigned a $40 million account after it was found that an ad
created by Scali was rigged to make a Volvo look
indestructible.
   Ad lawyers say the increased business is coming largely
from small and midsized agencies looking to outside counsel
for advice on an as-needed basis. Douglas Wood, a partner at
Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent &amp; Friedman, says the number of
agencies it serves is up significantly from a year ago, with
a big increase coming from small agencies outside New York.
The firm, one of the largest law firms specializing in ad
law, now services about 150 shops. Another firm, Winston &amp;
Strawn, just over a month ago set up a division in New York
for advertising agency clients. "We think there's room for
building" clients on the ad law front, says Len Orkin, a
partner there.
   Most of the very largest agencies already have a number of
attorneys on staff. Leo Burnett, for example, has eight
lawyers devoting their full time to ad law issues. Young &amp;
Rubicam has seven. But a big chunk of those lawyers' time is
spent dealing with corporate matters, not with matters
pertaining to the production of commercials. Some ad
officials expect those lawyers to start concentrating more of
their efforts on ad-review issues.
   Regulations governing advertising haven't changed. But
lawyers say the ad industry relaxed during the Reagan
administration, when the industry was largely left alone to
regulate itself. Under the Bush administration, things have
changed. FTC Chairwoman Janet Steiger has made it clear that
agencies -- in certain circumstances -- will be held
responsible for their part in allegedly deceptive
advertising.
   In its first major action, the FTC recently charged Lewis
Galoob Toys and its agency, Towne, Silverstein, Rotter of New
York. The FTC said Galoob ads misrepresented the performance
of several toys. The company and the ad agency didn't admit
any wrongdoing but signed consent agreements and pledged to
avoid making deceptive ad claims in the future.
   Some industry officials worry that ad agencies aren't
prepared for the new aggressiveness at the FTC. In an unusual
warning to member agencies, the American Advertising
Federation recently sent out an alert that trouble is ahead
if agencies aren't well-counseled or aware of the situations
that could involve them in FTC proceedings. "The industry
needs to be aware that the FTC has these rules and they're
going to enforce them," says Wally Snyder, executive vice
president at the trade group.
   Says Rosemary Nelson, a lawyer at Young &amp; Rubicam who
heads a group of ad-industry lawyers: "I think we're going to
be more sensitive to the fact that we are now going to have
to deal with a more active FTC. We're going to have to focus
on that more." She insists, though, that a new sensitivity
doesn't mean that agencies have been lax on such matters in
the past. "Even during the period when it was less regulated,
I don't think we had our guard down," she says.
   Hall Dickler's Mr. Wood says, though, that many agencies
don't know exactly what legal requirements exist on their end
of the commercial production process. Agencies are calling
more than ever to find out what kind of substantiation data
they need to avoid problems, he says.
   Executives at Scali have said they didn't do anything
wrong in the Volvo case, but the incident has scared other
agency executives into implementing tighter controls over the
ad production process. "Certainly, those two cases {Volvo and
Lewis Galoob} are sobering ways to end the year from a legal
standpoint," Mr. Wood says. "But it really has opened the
eyes of many advertising executives who weren't key players
in the old era of an activist FTC."
