   CANBERRA, Australia -- International Business Machines
Corp. plans to establish a major telecommunications
networking hub for the Asia-Pacific region in Australia.
   The move would see the Armonk, N.Y., computer company
double its existing Sydney-based networking capacity over the
next two years. Regional hubs provide a secure and
cost-effective way for international companies to channel
their business data, computer communications and telephone
traffic throughout a region and around the world.
