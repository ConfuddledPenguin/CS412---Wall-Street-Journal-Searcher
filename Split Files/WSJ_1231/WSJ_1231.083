   WASHINGTON -- Medicare payments to doctors should increase
7.3% in fiscal 1991, the Department of Health and Human
Services said.
   The department set the increase, which it calls a
"performance standard," for all physicians' services.

   HHS lists annual fee boosts for medical services under a
1989 law that aims to control the rate of increase in
Medicare payments to doctors.
   The figures aren't a limit on how much more the government
will pay doctors in fiscal 1991, which began Oct. 1. But
under the complicated 1989 law, the failure to keep Medicare
fee increases within those rates of growth could lead to
strict curbs in the years ahead. Over time, the new law will
slow either the rise in the fees doctors charge or the growth
in the volume of services, proponents contend.
