   We who dwell in the Northland
   Know all that winter brings:
   The white snowfall and rosy cheeks
   And the bracing wind that sings.
   Those who live in the Southland
   Miss all this in their mellow milieu,
   So do we envy our Southern friends?
   You bet your life we do]
   -- George O. Ludcke.
