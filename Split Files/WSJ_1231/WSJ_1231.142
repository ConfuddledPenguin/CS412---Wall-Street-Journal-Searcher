   Almost 20 years ago, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners created a computerized financial system to sift
through the annual filings of thousands of insurance
companies and identify those with a high risk of insolvency.
   The system has been touted from time to time as an almost
magical solution to regulatory problems, and it remains the
main way state regulators target insurers for thorough
examination. But in practice it has fallen short of
designers' hopes, and some critics suggest that, in the
current form, it is badly in need of overhaul.

   Called the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or
IRIS, it consists of 11 ratios that compare basic financial
components of each insurer. For instance, one test checks
premiums written compared to a company's capital; another
looks at levels of reserves for potential claims. There is
one set of ratios for property-casualty firms and one for
life insurers.
   Companies are slated for a brief check by a special team
of regulatory analysts from across the country if computers
turn up at least four categories in which a particular
insurer is deficient. If that initial look suggests there are
deeper problems, the company's home state is expected to do a
thorough examination.
   Back in the 1970s, IRIS fingered about 90% of the
companies that later became insolvent, and only about 15% of
its targets didn't later go broke, says James Schacht, deputy
director of the Illinois insurance department and one of
IRIS's developers. But now the system is catching only about
75% of those that eventually go under. And about 25% of
companies targeted by IRIS aren't really in trouble, meaning
that in some cases regulators' time is wasted investigating
healthy insurers.
   The problem is the increasing complexity of company
financial structures, says Mr. Schacht. This is worsened by
the growing number of companies.
   "The more false readings IRIS gives in either direction,
the less useful it is," notes James Baresse, professor of
economics at the College of Insurance in New York. He
concluded in a recent study that five of the
property-casualty ratios didn't produce a statistically
significant result. Similarly troubling results have been
reported in studies of the life insurance tests.
   Another problem facing regulators, who rely heavily on the
system, is the risk that IRIS will be fooled by misleading
numbers in financial statements. Integrity Insurance Co., the
insolvent New Jersey firm profiled earlier in this series,
had a sturdy-looking balance sheet in large part because it
reserved far too little for future claims by policyholders, a
problem that slipped by IRIS at the time.
   Mr. Schacht and others are trying to beef up the system.
New ratios, which are secret, have been added to the older
IRIS set. And so-called "expert systems" are being
considered, in which computers would be programmed to
investigate more-intricate relationships in financial
reports, ones that experts hope will make it harder to
mislead the system with false data.
