   WASHINGTON -- The greenback has fallen dramatically in the
past year to its lowest level in years. Yet the U.S. still is
running a persistent trade deficit of about $100 billion
annually. In fact, the latest trade statistics, for October,
showed a worrying 25% deterioration in the trade account, to
a monthly deficit of $11.6 billion from $9.3 billion in
September.
   This defies conventional economic wisdom. A plunging
dollar should at least begin to correct the trade imbalance.
What's wrong?

   Oil and autos. Period.
   Excepting those, the trade imbalance has disappeared,
thanks in part to the depreciating dollar.
   But there are limits to depreciation. It can do nothing to
counter the economic effects of Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, which pushed up oil prices sharply to
more than $30 a barrel during the fall. Even now, oil is
hovering around $26 a barrel, up from $18 a barrel early this
year. Because of higher oil prices, the nation's oil deficit
rose to $6.4 billion in October from $5.5 billion in
September.
                                                                                                       

   A resolution of the Gulf conflict should lead to a large
drop in oil prices, probably to as low as $20 a barrel, says
James Fralick, an economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York. That, in turn, would knock as much as $85 billion off
the trade deficit, he estimates. "The run up in oil prices
has camouflaged most of the improvement that has gone on in
the trade account," he says.

   The trade role of oil imports is massive. They represented
53% of the overall deficit of $85.9 billion in the first 10
months of 1990.
   Massive as well is the trade role of automobiles, which
are also the largest consumers of oil. In the same 10 months,
the deficit in cars and automotive products -- the other
major component of the trade deficit -- was about $42.2
billion.
   Looking ahead, if deficits in oil and cars plus auto parts
are taken out, the trade account is projected to reach a
surplus of about $20 billion in 1991. That's a $60 billion
improvement from a deficit of about $40 billion for the
non-oil, non-auto trade account in 1987.
   There are further benefits still to filter through from
past depreciation of the dollar.
   "Over the coming months, there should be some more
improvement in the trade account," says John Williamson of
the Institute of International Economics, a think tank here.
He and his colleagues have stopped advocating dollar
depreciation. In his organization, at least, "I don't think
there's anybody now who thinks it should go down further," he
says.
   In fact, there may be risks to promoting further
depreciation. "The potential costs of further depreciation --
such as inflation, a loss of confidence in U.S. financial
assets and other distortions -- far outweigh any theoretical
benefits," says Lawrence Kudlow, an economist with Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co.
   Depreciation also carries political costs. Some in Europe,
especially in France, see it as predatory, a sign that the
U.S. is subsidizing its exports and resorting to a
beggar-thy-neighbor exchange-rate policy. This view has made
it harder for the U.S. to get its trading partners to drop
their own protectionist habits.
   Further depreciation also won't solve the nation's basic
economic problems. The U.S. still hasn't achieved the
productivity gains, the cutbacks in consumption and the
increases in savings that it needs for a competitive economy
over the long haul.
   "The U.S. has to correct its overconsumption,
underinvestment, undersavings mentality," says Rimmer de
Vries, a managing director of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. "U.S.
policy makers," he adds, "could do more to encourage private
savings and stimulate equity and plant-and-equipment
investment, rather than real estate investment."
   Further depreciation also is no substitute for an energy
policy that emphasizes less importing of oil, for even if oil
prices should fall the U.S. would still face a significant
deficit in oil trade. The U.S. could look to its supplies of
natural gas, "an abundant and environmentally clean natural
resource that is highly underutilized," says Mr. de Vries. "A
breakthrough in this area would strengthen greatly the U.S.
trade balance, the dollar, real incomes and net savings."
                                                                                                       

   Finally, further depreciation wouldn't address the
necessity of getting a new, strong accord under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Only such an agreement will
give the U.S. the kind of access it needs to international
markets to allow its competitive companies to export freely.
                                                                                                       

   A lawless trading system wouldn't be a pretty sight. In
recent weeks, for example, Japanese securities firms
reportedly have been doing their best to block some firms
there from using the services of Salomon Brothers Inc. for
securities transactions. And South Korea has recently shown
an increasing willingness to pursue protectionism against
U.S. and other foreign companies.
   All the dollar depreciation in the world wouldn't begin to
help stop such activities.
