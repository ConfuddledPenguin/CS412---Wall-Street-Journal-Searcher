   LONGS DRUG STORES Corp. (Walnut Creek, Calif.) -- Robert
M. Long, the president and chief executive officer of this
drug store chain, temporarily assumed the postion of chairman
of the 13-member board after his father, Joseph M. Long,
chairman and co-founder, died Thursday at the age of 78.
Robert M. Long said he plans no changes in the operations of
the company. Joseph M. Long and his brother, Thomas J. Long,
a director, founded the company in Oakland, Calif., in 1938.
Since then, the company has grown to 257 stores in six states
with more than 14,000 employees and sales last year of more
than $2 billion.
