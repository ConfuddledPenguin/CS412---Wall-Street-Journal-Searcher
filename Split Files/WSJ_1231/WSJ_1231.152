   NEW YORK -- A late-afternoon cut in the discount rate
began a final-hour stock market rally and transformed what
had been a dull day for over-the-counter stocks.
   The Nasdaq composite index was lingering about 1.5 points
higher when the Federal Reserve announced it would reduce to
6.5% from 7% the rate the Fed charges banks for borrowing by
member banks. The move is effective today.

   News that the Fed was still in the battle to pull
corporate America out of economic doldrums began a buying
spree that more than doubled early gains.
   The Nasdaq composite index closed 4.45 points, or 1.2%,
higher at 370.17.
   "The market wanted to go higher all day. The Fed gave it
the impetus," said Steve Bliss, head of OTC trading for Mabon
Nugent &amp; Co.
   Investors reacted to the news by buying OTC technology and
industrial stocks ahead of financial issues. While the Nasdaq
100, an index of the 100 largest nonfinancial OTC stocks,
rose 2.1% on the day, the Nasdaq Financial 100 index gained
just 1.2%.
   Apple Computer, which benefited also from a First Boston
recommendation, jumped 2 1/8 to 42 1/4. Microsoft added 1 1/4
to 75 1/4. Sun Microsystems surged 1 5/8 to 22 5/8.
   Intel climbed 1 1/2 to 37 1/4.
   Before the cut in the discount rate lit the fuse,
yesterday's trading was anything but fireworks.
   The slow pace betrayed a malaise among investors that
suggested to many traders the market had begun the Christmas
holidays earlier than usual.
   Perhaps not realizing just how prophetic his remarks would
be, one trader late in the afternoon said the market
displayed good tone but needed a push before it would take
any bold steps in that reluctant atmosphere.
   "The easiest thing to do is nothing. Absent any major
news, this is going to be a quiet week," said John Giesea,
manager of OTC trading for Advest.
   He was right. A moment later, the Fed made its
announcement, and stock prices took off.
   The advance-decline line, which had been mostly in
balance, shifted. The day ended with 1,059 stocks showing
gains and 899 posting losses.
   National Market System volume surged from a slow pace to a
more moderate 103 million shares. More than 85 million shares
were traded Monday.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the gains about matched
the 1.2% OTC advance. The New York Stock Exchange composite
index was up 1.97 points, or 1.1%, to 180.19. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed at 2626.73, up 33.41 points.
   Earnings news and outlooks drove many stocks yesterday.
One technology stock to benefit from a positive forecast was
AST Research.
   AST shares gained 5 1/2 points to close at 32, a new
52-week high. The 20% climb came as the computer maker said
it expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to climb to $1 a
share from the 62 cents a share it earned a year ago. AST
also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
   Dime Financial lost 1 to 5 when the company cut its
quarterly dividend in half to 10 cents a share and predicted
earnings for the year would drop to $4.2 million from $7.3
million a year ago. Dime Financial said, "all signs are that
the economic decline in New England will extend well into
next year."
   Aspect Telecommunications shares tumbled 2 1/2 to 6 after
the company told analysts Monday to expect fourth-quarter
results to be disappointing. Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report said Aspect told analysts to anticipate a break-even
quarter.
   Metcalf &amp; Eddy fell 1 1/4 to 11 1/2. The engineering and
construction firm reported fiscal 1990 net income declined to
$1.03 a share from $1.11 a share a year ago. Metcalf &amp; Eddy
also said it would stop work on a rehabilitation program
until the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority makes
substantial contract payments.
   Paychex shares fell 2 to 17 1/4. Paychex reported fiscal
second-quarter earnings improved marginally, to 22 cents a
share from 21 cents in the quarter last year.
   Fabricland rose 2 1/4 to 12 1/4 on news that House of
Fabrics offered $13.50 a share in cash to acquire Fabricland.
In a letter to the board, Fabricland President Gary Larkins
called the offer "fair and generous."
   Teradata closed 7/8 higher at 13 3/4. PIR suggested recent
strength in Teradata's stock might be because of NCR's 9.4%
stake in the company. The speculation is that NCR might want
to buy all of Teradata as part of its defense against
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's hostile takeover attempt.
PIR said Teradata shares have risen about 35% in the past
week.
   Reuters Holdings ADRs were unchanged at 38 3/4. Rupert
Murdoch resigned from the board of the international news and
systems company.

   HOUSE OF FABRICS Inc.'s president and chief executive
officer, Gary L. Larkins, said in a letter to Fabricland Inc.
directors that the $13.50-a-share bid by House of Fabrics for
Fabricland was "both fair and generous" to Fabricland
shareholders. In the OTC Focus column in the Dec. 19 edition,
Mr. Larkin was misidentified as a Fabricland officer and his
comment was incorrectly attributed to the president of
Fabricland, which said it hadn't responded to the bid.
