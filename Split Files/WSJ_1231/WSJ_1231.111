   The Justice Department said it will ask a federal court to
block General Binding Corp.'s proposed $50 million
acquisition of VeloBind Inc. on antitrust grounds.
   General Binding, Northbrook, Ill., makes business machines
and related office supplies. It is the nation's largest maker
of high-volume mechanized binding machines, the federal
agency said. VeloBind, Fremont, Calif., is the second-largest
producer of such gear.

   The proposed $9.77-a-share acquisition could
"substantially lessen competition" in the field, particularly
between the two companies, the Justice Department said. In
national over-the-counter trading Friday, VeloBind shares
fell $2.125, or 23%, to close at $7, and General Binding
shares slid $1 to close at $15.
   General and VeloBind announced their agreement in
September, but antitrust regulators' scrutiny of the deal
deferred its closing. In a joint statement Friday, the two
companies expressed "puzzlement" at the agency's action and
said they intend to hold further talks with it in an effort
to resolve the department's concerns.
