   ATLANTA -- Equifax Inc. and Telecredit Inc. said
shareholders of both companies approved Equifax's acquisition
of Telecredit in a stock swap valued at $513 million.
   The merger makes Telecredit a wholly owned subsidiary of
Equifax through a tax-free exchange of 2.86 shares of Equifax
for each share of Telecredit. That number was raised from
2.69 in November to compensate for a decline in Equifax stock
value.
