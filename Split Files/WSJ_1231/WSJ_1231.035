   OKLAHOMA CITY -- Television newsman Jack Bowen claimed his
ex-employer had pulled the rug out from over him.
   When KWTV Channel 9 took Mr. Bowen off the air in June
after a stalemate on his contract, the deposed anchorman went
shopping for a new job. He also went shopping for new clothes
and a new toupee. The CBS affiliate refused to reimburse its
former anchor for his $994.67 tab, so he sued in small-claims
court.

   Not one to split hairs, county judge Charles Humble noted
that Mr. Bowen's contract hadn't yet expired, so the station
must honor its contractual allowances for his hair and
clothes, even though he wore them to cross the street to
rival KOCO-TV, the ABC affiliate.
   So it goes in the nation's 40th largest television market,
where the industry is often as entertaining as its broadcast
fare. Puffed up by the 1970s booms in oil and gas and
broadcast television, Oklahoma City now has six commercial
stations. But with the economy in the ditch since 1982,
competition has been fierce over on-air personalities,
slogans and even charity drives.
   Like most of these clashes, the Bowen affair produced
considerable smoke and dust but little progress. Mr. Bowen
was back where he started, at the station that employed him
for 13 years before KWTV wooed him away in 1987. KWTV rehired
the anchor Mr. Bowen replaced then.
   Both sides managed to stay cool at first. Mr. Bowen
shelved his plans to sue KWTV for bad-faith bargaining. For
its part, the station held its fire after KOCO aired
advertisements urging viewers to "Get Back with Jack,"
starring the back of a Bowen look-alike. Only KWTV could
promote Mr. Bowen's name and image until his contract expired
in August, says KWTV Vice President Jerry G. Dalrymple, "but
we didn't see any point in making a stink over it." That is,
until Mr. Bowen submitted his final expense account.
   Mr. Bowen's new employer warned him that his lawsuit would
peel away not only his cranial cover-up but also his privacy,
disclosing his last salary at KWTV of $147,300, plus $3,000
for clothes and $1,500 for hair. Mr. Bowen says he wasn't
daunted. "I said, `Ooh, are they going to tell the public I
wear makeup too?'" he recalls.
   The court ordered KWTV to reimburse Mr. Bowen and
dismissed the station's counterclaim for breach of contract.
"After years of reporting on other people," he says, "it felt
so good to see the system would work for me."
