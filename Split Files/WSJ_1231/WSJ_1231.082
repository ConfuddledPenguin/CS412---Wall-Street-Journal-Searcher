   TOKYO -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu shuffled his cabinet
over the weekend, but the changes most likely won't alter
Japan's foreign and economic policies.
   Mr. Kaifu, who had resisted a shuffle, finally gave in to
power brokers within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party but
found a way to keep the most important cabinet positions, as
well as the top officers of the LDP unchanged.

   The new cabinet will be Mr. Kaifu's third since he took
over as prime minister 17 months ago. Mr. Kaifu's term as
president of the LDP, and hence prime minister, expires next
October. Most political observers doubt that Mr. Kaifu will
get a second term. Some wonder whether he will serve out his
term.
   Mr. Kaifu gave the LDP faction led by former Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe an extra seat in the cabinet.
   In other cabinet moves, Motoji Kondo was named agriculture
minister and Eiichi Nakao, who served as director of the
Economic Planning Agency under former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, was named Minister of International Trade and
Industry.
   Kazuo Aichi was named director general of the Environment
Agency. Akiko Santo, a former actress, was named director
general of the Science and Technology agency.
   Seiroku Kajiyama, the justice minister who created a
ruckus with a slur against blacks this year, got the boot.
