   CHICAGO -- Haggling between the Bush administration and
the Soviet Union over U.S. food credits to the U.S.S.R. and
speculation about impending agricultural reports will
dominate trading in grain futures this week.
   On Friday representatives of the Soviet Union and the U.S.
Agriculture Department will meet to hammer out terms of the
$1 billion in credits that the department granted for Soviet
purchases of U.S. foodstuffs.

   The Soviets have said they want to use the bulk of the
credits to buy corn. The USDA, contending that the U.S.S.R.
has not bought enough wheat to comply with its long-term
trade agreement with the U.S., wants the country to buy a
combination of wheat and corn. Analysts say the USDA may try
to entice the Soviets to buy wheat by offering it at a
discounted price.
   In addition, the Soviet Union, which is having chronic
problems delivering food to its citizens, wants to use some
of its food-aid credits to pay for shipping whatever food it
buys to its shores, but the USDA opposes this idea. Traders
this week will be watching for new developments in the
dialogue on these issues.
   Also on Friday, the USDA's hog and pig report will be
released, giving grain traders an idea of demand for grains
as feed for livestock. One week later, on Jan. 11, the USDA
will release its final crop production report, which will
contain statistics likely to have a profound impact on all
grain futures prices. The data in the crop report will
include final estimates of the 1990 crops in corn, wheat and
soybeans; existing stocks of grains; and supply and demand
summaries.
   The Jan. 11 report is likely to set the tone for grain
futures trading over the next three months, analysts said.
Trading between now and then is expected to be light, because
investors will be reluctant to take positions in the face of
such potentially major news.
   Traders will be watching the USDA's estimate of the
soybean crop particularly closely, because many view with
skepticism the department's November projection that the
soybean harvest will be 78 million bushels larger than
previously expected. "That estimate increase was a shock to
the industry," said Daniel Basse, director of market research
for AgResource Co., Chicago. "Quite a few people think the
USDA overestimated the crop."
   Also keenly watched in the coming week will be any news
that seems likely to affect U.S. exports in corn or soybeans,
which are at their lowest since 1974. (Mexico, contributing
to the problem, lowered its U.S. corn imports from 3.8
million metric tons to 2.5 million last week because it is
now forecasting a record corn harvest in its own country of
12 million metric tons.)
   Unless events conspire to boost U.S. grain exports in
early January, analysts said, the USDA will have to revise
its potentially optimistic export calculations soon.
   Looking ahead to other commodities markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Crude oil prices rose Friday in extremely light activity
with little news to spur trading. Moving in a narrow range,
crude oil for February delivery ended at $27.57 a barrel, up
56 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders said
fears of war in the Middle East have been resurfacing lately
on the floor of the New York Merc, although few expect any
confrontation before Jan. 15, which is the United Nations
deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait. Heating oil for January
delivery finished at 79.78 cents a gallon, down 1.1 cents.
January gasoline settled at 69.56 cents a gallon, up 0.92
cent. Traders said activity will continue to focus on the
chances of war.
                                                                                                       

   Precious Metals
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices were strong Friday, closing near their
highs of the day. February delivery gold was up $8.60 an
ounce to $396.20. March silver advanced 9 cents an ounce to
$4.245. April platinum rose $6.40 an ounce to $415.30. A weak
dollar, growing tensions in the Persian Gulf and a thinly
traded holiday market all contributed to the price rises.
   "As the days tick off toward the Jan. 15 deadline by which
Iraq is to get out of Kuwait, there is a tendency for traders
to buy contracts rather than sell them," said one analyst.
There were reports of scrimmages in the Middle East, but the
Pentagon denied them, he said. Nevertheless, the February
gold contract rose through resistance levels at $391, $393
and $395, which touched off further buying and accelerated
the advance, he said.

   Copper
                                                                                                       

   Copper futures prices rose Friday. The March contract
ended with a gain of 3 cents a pound to $1.141. Reports by
various news services of a strike at Chuquicamata, one of
Chile's major mines that produces an estimated 550,000 tons
of refined copper a year, triggered the buying, an analyst
said. Light holiday trading conditions also were a factor and
prices accelerated when the March contract rose above several
key resistance levels, he said. Traders ignored a rise in
London Metal Exchange copper stocks, as well as further
indications of a weakening U.S. economy, he said.
