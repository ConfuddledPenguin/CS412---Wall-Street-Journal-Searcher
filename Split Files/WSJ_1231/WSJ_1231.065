   BELTSVILLE, Md. -- John Hanson Bancorp said its John
Hanson Savings Bank unit anticipated being unable to arrange
for a capital infusion of $10 million by today -- one of the
requirements of its capital plan that was approved by the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision in July.
   A bank spokesman said, "We will probably resubmit an
amended capital plan and they will review that." He declined
to speculate on the actions the thrift office could take if
the amended plan is denied. As of Sept. 30, John Hanson's
assets totaled $874.6 million.

   The bank, which has 15 branch offices, said it is
continuing efforts to raise capital from "all viable sources"
and is working with the thrift office in efforts to comply
with regulatory capital requirements.
