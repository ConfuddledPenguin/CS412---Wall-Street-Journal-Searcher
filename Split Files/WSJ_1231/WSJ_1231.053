   WASHINGTON -- Potomac Electric Power Co. said it filed a
request for an electric rate increase of 9.6%, or $56.4
million, for its District of Columbia business.
   The requested rates would increase revenue in two steps:
$41.2 million, effective in late 1991, and $15.2 million,
effective June 1, 1992, to coincide with the start-up of a
138-megawatt combustion turbine and related facilities at the
company's Dickerson Generating Station.

   Potomac Electric said its last District of Columbia rate
increase, 1.6% or $9.5 million, was granted in July 1990. The
company, however, had requested an increase of 5.8% or $33.4
million, and subsequently filed for reconsideration, a
request still pending with regulators.
