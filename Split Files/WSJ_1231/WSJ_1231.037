   HOUSE OF FABRICS Inc.'s president and chief executive
officer, Gary L. Larkins, said in a letter to Fabricland Inc.
directors that the $13.50-a-share bid by House of Fabrics for
Fabricland was "both fair and generous" to Fabricland
shareholders. In the OTC Focus column in the Dec. 19 edition,
Mr. Larkin was misidentified as a Fabricland officer and his
comment was incorrectly attributed to the president of
Fabricland, which said it hadn't responded to the bid.

   CHUO KAGAKU Co., a Japanese maker of food containers, said
it will sell a device, priced at the equivalent of $7,570, to
condense used plastic-foam containers at shops and
restaurants so they can be recycled as fuel for industrial
boilers. The price of the device was misstated in the Dec. 10
edition.
