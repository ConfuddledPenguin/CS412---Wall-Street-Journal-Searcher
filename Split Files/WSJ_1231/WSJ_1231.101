   NEW YORK -- With stocks up 11% since mid-October, somebody
must be bullish. And that somebody seems to include mutual
fund investors.
   In November, stock mutual funds pulled in $1.4 billion
more than they surrendered to departing shareholders.
Moreover, a sampling of major fund groups shows that
investors continued to pour money into stock funds in
December.

   "I call them the `chicken' stock buyers," says Jon
Fossel,, president of New York's Oppenheimer Management Corp.
He notes that investors may be buying stocks, but they are
opting for conservative funds such as equity-income funds and
so-called asset allocation funds.
   The Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait prompted a rash of
withdrawals from stock funds. According to the Investment
Company Institute, stock funds suffered net outflows of $2.8
billion in August and an additional $484 million in
September.
   That outflow turned around in October, when $734 million
flowed back into stock funds. November's $1.4 billion inflow
is the strongest since June 1990. (These figures reflect
stock fund sales less redemptions, plus the net result of
switches between stock funds and other funds in the same fund
family. Reinvested dividends are excluded.)
   Fund groups such as Financial Programs, Janus Capital,
Twentieth Century and Vanguard Group all report strong net
inflows into their stock funds during December.
   But not everybody saw a pickup in the stock fund business.
New England Securities and Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark say that
the inflows into their stock funds slowed in the past four
weeks. Fidelity Investments says its stock funds saw a small
net outflow.
   "December, of course, is the month that people hold back
equity fund purchases because of the capital gains
distributions," notes Gavin Quill, a Scudder marketing
research analyst. At year end, stock funds usually make big
capital gains and income distributions, on which investors
then have to pay taxes.
   Among specialty funds, Financial Programs and Vanguard
both say that their health care funds were big money magnets,
and that their energy funds had net outflows. At Franklin
Resources, there was keen interest in the fund group's gold
and utility funds. "That would seem to indicate that people
are pretty apprehensive," says Gregory Johnson, a Franklin
marketing vice president.
   The outlook for stock fund sales is bright, according to a
survey conducted for Fidelity by the University of Michigan
Survey Research Center. The December survey found that 35% of
fund owners plan to buy a stock fund over the next three
months, up from 25% in November and just 12% in July. (These
figures reflect the percentage planning to buy a stock fund
minus those planning to sell.)
   Stock fund managers, meanwhile, continue to sit on a pile
of cash. But because a rising stock market boosted the value
of stock fund assets in November, cash as a percentage of
fund assets dropped to 12.4% from October's 12.9%.
   Though stock fund sales had a rough ride in 1990, the
biggest loser has been taxable bond funds. So far this year,
stock funds have pulled in $12.8 billion, but taxable bond
funds have bled $658 million.
   High-yielding junk bond funds gave up an additional $399
million in November, bringing this year's net outflow to $4.5
billion. And U.S. government bond funds have hemorrhaged $7.1
billion this year.
   Bond funds "were sold primarily to savers, not to
investors," says A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper
Analytical Services. For many bond fund investors, he says,
"volatility in both dividends and share price has come as a
surprise."
   But Oppenheimer's Mr. Fossel says that sales of his fund
group's government bond funds picked up in December, and
other fund companies have noticed a similar trend. "The
public has noticed that money fund rates have come down, so
they've extended maturities," Mr. Fossel says. "I think it's
a very wise move on their part."
