   WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court ruled last April that
Oregon could prohibit religious use of the drug peyote, civil
liberties lawyers warned that the decision would erode
religious freedom.
   But while dire predictions may be warranted about the
decision's effect on First Amendment freedoms, the impact may
be limited by an important, continuing trend in
constitutional law: reliance on state constitutions.

   Last month, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that its own
state constitution provides greater protection for religious
freedom than does the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. As a result, the Minnesota court declined to
require the Amish community to comply with a state law that
they almost surely would have had to obey under the reasoning
of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last spring.
   This is just one illustration of one of the most
significant developments in modern constitutional law. With
increasing frequency, state courts are deciding that their
state constitutions afford greater protection to many civil
liberties than the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the
federal Constitution. More than 500 state supreme court
decisions have followed this trend, about three-fourths of
them in the last decade.
   This development first came to public attention in 1977,
when the Harvard Law Review published a speech by
then-Supreme Court Justice William Brennan suggesting that
civil-liberties lawyers might look to state constitutions,
especially as the high court grows reluctant to give
expansive readings to the U.S. Constitution.
   Under this approach, subsequently validated by the Supreme
Court, the high court's interpretations of the U.S.
Constitution are a floor, not a ceiling. State courts can't
provide less protection for civil liberties than the U.S.
Constitution guarantees, but they may provide more.
   The Minnesota case shows how this approach works. Police
officials gave traffic tickets to members of the Amish
community who refused to display "slow-moving vehicle"
reflectors on the back of their horse-drawn buggies. The
Amish asked a state court to throw out the tickets. They
argued that displaying the yellow, orange and red reflector
triangles would violate their religious beliefs, which
require them to remain separate from the modern world and to
avoid "worldly symbols."
   In 1989, the Minnesota Supreme Court said enforcing the
reflector law against the Amish violated the First Amendment
guarantee of "free exercise" of religion, which the U.S.
Supreme Court had interpreted to mean that states should try
to accommodate religious practices.
   Then, last April, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin
Scalia, the U.S. Supreme Court said states may enforce laws
that are generally applicable to everyone -- without making
exceptions for religious groups. The justices upheld Oregon's
criminal ban on use of peyote in ceremonies of the Native
American Church. Experts said this was a major change in
course for the high court, although Justice Scalia said his
ruling was more limited than that.
   Minnesota had appealed the Amish case to the U.S. Supreme
Court, and a few days after the peyote decision, the justices
told the Minnesota court to reconsider its Amish ruling.
   When the Minnesota court took a new look at the case,
however, the judges decided they didn't need the U.S.
Constitution at all. Instead, they concluded that Article I,
Section 16 of the Minnesota Constitution, adopted in 1858,
provides "a broad protection for religious freedom." The
reflector law violated the state constitutional rights of the
Amish, the Minnesota court said. The state's safety concerns
could be satisfied by the Amish using reflector tape and red
lanterns, which the religious order said wouldn't violate its
beliefs.
   There is a poignancy to the use of the approach signaled
by Justice Brennan in the Amish case. Justice Brennan, who
retired in July, wrote the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1963
decision that was all but overruled by Justice Scalia's April
opinion.
