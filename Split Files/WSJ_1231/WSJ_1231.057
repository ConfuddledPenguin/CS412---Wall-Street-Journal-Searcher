   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it filed a civil
antitrust suit to try to block the proposed acquisition of
First Interstate of Hawaii Inc. by First Hawaiian Inc.
   The controversial acquisition of First Interstate, the
holding company for that state's fourth-largest bank, by
First Hawaiian, parent of the state's second-largest
commercial bank, had received the approval of the Federal
Reserve Board Nov. 30, despite strong objections from the
Justice Department's antitrust division.

   The department's lawsuit, filed Friday in the federal
court in Honolulu, is a setback for First Hawaiian and former
Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, who helps control First
Interstate. Mr. Simon is co-chairman of an investor group
that bought First Interstate in February 1989 for $31 million
and had agreed to sell it to First Hawaiian for about $140
million.
   Mr. Simon, renowned for his well-timed buy-outs of such
concerns as Gibson Greeting Cards, personally stands to gain
an estimated $20 million if the deal isn't blocked.
   In Honolulu, First Hawaiian officials said in a prepared
statement that they were "disappointed" with the Justice
Department's decision and would study its action and decide
on a response, which may include litigation to block the
order. Neither Mr. Simon nor other officials of First
Interstate could be reached for comment.
   First Hawaiian has total assets of about $5.5 billion;
First Interstate has roughly $858 million. First Hawaiian
stock closed at $21, unchanged, in national over-the-counter
trading Friday.
   In its lawsuit, the Justice Department charged that the
proposed acquisition would violate federal antitrust law by
excessively concentrating control of banking services in five
geographic markets in Hawaii: Honolulu County, East Hawaii,
West Hawaii, Kauai and Maui. First Hawaiian and First
Interstate now compete in providing services such as checking
accounts and loans for business customers.
   James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief,
said: "This acquisition will hurt the many
small-to-medium-sized businesses in Hawaii. The acquisition
will eliminate one of only a few banks serving those
customers and will likely result in them paying higher prices
for services."
   By acquiring 100% of First Interstate's stock, First
Hawaiian, the parent of First Hawaiian Bank, had hoped to
shore up its competitive position against Bancorp Hawaii
Inc., parent of Hawaii's largest bank, Bank of Hawaii. As big
as First Hawaiian and Bancorp Hawaii are, the Fed had said in
November that adequate competition would continue to exist
under the merger because of the existence of three other
banks, as well as five thrift institutions, in the island
state.
   First Interstate officials have contended that while the
proposed merger "would lessen competition to some extent," it
wouldn't do so significantly.
   Walter Dods Jr., First Hawaiian's chief executive officer,
said before the Justice Department's action Friday that the
company would sell three branches in the outer islands to
ensure that the acquisition would not violate antitrust
standards. But that promise didn't satisfy the Justice
Department, which has taken a somewhat more skeptical view of
mergers in the past 18 months, compared with the hands-off
policies of the Reagan administration.
   First Hawaiian has about 50 branches in the islands; First
Interstate has 19.
