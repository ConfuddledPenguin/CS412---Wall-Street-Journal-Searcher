   An article on Sept. 12 stated that our product, Cisco, is
"known on the street as liquid crack."
   According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest
(CSPI), the term "liquid crack" was "coined by concerned
citizens in Washington" and not by people on the street. We
find this extremely disturbing: To call a legal
alcoholic-beverage product "liquid crack" dangerously
diminishes the seriousness of an illegal-drug problem that
has become one of our nation's worst social ills. The
implication that illegal drugs are no worse than legal
alcoholic beverages does a grave disservice to anti-drug
campaigns.

   We have never received any complaints from consumers,
retailers or wholesalers about incidences of mistaking Cisco,
a 20% alcohol wine beverage, for a 4% alcohol wine cooler.
Nevertheless, as soon as we heard the National Council on
Alcohol and Drug Dependence and the Center for Science in the
Public Interest's claims that our product could be mistaken
for a wine cooler, we took a series of steps to ensure there
be no confusion between Cisco and low-alcohol coolers,
including placing the statement "This product is not a wine
cooler" on all Cisco bottles.
   We are a responsible company selling a legal product. Like
all producers of alcoholic beverages, we strongly support
existing laws prohibiting the purchase of alcoholic beverages
by minors. We also support the efforts of community leaders
and concerned citizens to curb alcohol and drug abuse and to
educate consumers about the dangers of drunk driving.
