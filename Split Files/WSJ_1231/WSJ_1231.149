   Two leading political opponents of Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko called for an investigation into whether a top
official of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank acted improperly in his dealings with Mr. Mobutu's
regime.
   They urged that the IMF and the World Bank conduct an
inquiry into the ties between the Mobutu regime and Jacques
de Groote, a Belgian native and one of the most senior
executive directors of both institutions. "I think it's in
the interest of everybody's credibility -- the IMF, the World
Bank and Zaire -- to launch an investigation," said Nguza
Karl-i-Bond, a former Zairian prime minister, foreign
minister and ambassador to Washington.

   Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, a prominent opposition figure and,
like Mr. Nguza, a candidate for the presidency of Zaire, went
even further. He urged that Belgian finance authorities, to
whom Mr. de Groote reports, conduct a separate inquiry into
conflict-of-interest questions raised by this newspaper in a
front-page profile last Friday of Mr. de Groote.
   An IMF spokesman said yesterday that "at this point, we
are not in a position to comment." A World Bank spokesman
also declined to comment. In an interview last October,
however, Barber Conable, the World Bank's chairman and
president, said: "If we were aware of an impropriety, we
would contact" Belgian authorities "and urge them to look
into it."
   Mr. de Groote, who doesn't represent Zaire at the IMF and
the World Bank, has acted as an adviser to the Mobutu regime
on finance policies for many years. He acknowledged in
interviews that even at the two institutions some believe he
was acting as a paid Mobutu agent. He strongly denied
receiving any money from Mr. Mobutu or his associates.
   The story also focused on Mr. de Groote's money problems
and his efforts to press the African nation of Rwanda into
devaluing its currency in the early 1980s. The devaluation
was being promoted by a Brussels businessman who was
assisting Mr. de Groote with his finances. Again, Mr. de
Groote denied he acted improperly.
   Belgian government officials haven't commented on the
story. But Arthur Gilson, a former Belgian defense minister,
said in an interview that the Belgian "prime minister and the
minister of finance should immediately and seriously start
looking into" the allegations.
   The IMF and the World Bank each have 22 directors. Mr. de
Groote and the others direct the affairs of the
multibillion-dollar institutions; their duties include
approving large loans to poorer countries and helping nations
adopt sound monetary policies. Mr. de Groote has been elected
to represent Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Turkey, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia -- but not Zaire.
   President Mobutu's opponents, who hope to unseat him in an
election in 1991, have campaigned against the corruption that
has pervaded his rule since he took power in the African
country in 1965. Mr. Mobutu himself is reputed to be a
billionaire.
   Mr. Nguza, once an insider, found it extraordinary that
Mr. de Groote had characterized Mr. Mobutu, a strong U.S.
ally, as "corrupt" in an interview with this newspaper.
"That's a serious accusation directed at a head of state by a
senior official of a highly respected institution." Mr. Nguza
said. President Mobutu didn't respond to written questions
submitted earlier this year.
   Mr. Tshisekedi, a prominent opposition leader who often
has been arrested by Mr. Mobutu's security forces, said in
Brussels that he feared any investigation by the World Bank,
the IMF and Belgian authorities wouldn't be thorough because
it might embarrass them. He also said that Mr. Mobutu
wouldn't likely cooperate with any inquiry.
