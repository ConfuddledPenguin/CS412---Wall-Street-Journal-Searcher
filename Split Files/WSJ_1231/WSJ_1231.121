   Numerica Financial Corp. said its Numerica Savings Bank
unit has received a cease-and-desist order obliging the bank
to tighten lending policies and raise about $40 million in
capital by June 1991.
   The Manchester, N.H., thrift is ordered to strengthen
lending standards, especially in commerical real estate,
where it has experienced most of its problems as the New
England econony has continued to sag.

<TEXT>
   A cease-and-desist order, considered the most serious
regulatory step short of seizure, obligates the bank's board
to ensure changes are made by the institution's management.
   In the third quarter, Numerica's loss widened to $4.1
million, or 93 cents a share, from $1 million, or 23 cents a
share, a year earlier.
