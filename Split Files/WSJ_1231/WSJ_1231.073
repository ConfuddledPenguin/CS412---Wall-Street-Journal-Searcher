   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., after an arduous
struggle, said it received enough notes to complete its cash
tender offer and restructure its debt by today -- but not
enough to escape its chronic liquidity problems.
   The offer, which helps Western Union restructure its
approximately $530 million in junk debt, is expected to be
completed today after the company completes the sale of its
business services unit, an electronic mail and telex
business, to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.

   "We've cleared a major hurdle," said a Western Union
spokesman. "It eliminates the default that has existed since
June {when Western Union missed a $51 million interest
payment} and the threat of being forced into involuntary
bankruptcy by our creditors."
   However, Western Union, now a mere vestige of the
communications giant it once was, said it must still seek new
financing in 1991 to meet cash obligations including debt
interest payments. If this fails, it could yet be forced into
bankruptcy-law proceedings by creditors.
   "We may have to sell assets, or find new financing or
propose to restructure our remaining outstanding debt," said
the spokesman.
   While he declined to elaborate on what assets remain that
Western Union could sell, he did make it clear that the
company is not out of the woods. That is because it will
still be left with about $311 million in debt -- including
other IOUs spread among 11 different issues of notes of
various interest rates -- and annual interest expenses of $52
million a year.
   The company may not be able to cover these payments with
the cash flow it gets from its remaining financial services
unit, which includes a bill payment service (formerly
National Payments Network, which Western Union acquired in
1989), Mailgram and Telegram.
   The spokesman said the company, which is controlled by New
York financier Bennett S. LeBow, does not break out cash flow
from its operations.
   However, in a statement filed late last month with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Western Union said it
could experience total negative cash flow of almost $70
million in 1991 and more than $200 million in 1992. In 1989
the company's operating cash flow amounted to about $61
million -- but this was still insufficient to meet its debt
obligations and this figure included the business services
unit, which Western Union will lose after today.
   Western Union is set to receive $175 million in cash from
AT&amp;T for the business services unit and apply the money
toward its cash tender, which was aimed at retiring up to
$350 million principal amount of its 19 1/4% notes and 16%
notes for 50 cents on the dollar. The company stipulated that
at least $250 million in 19 1/4% notes had to be tendered to
complete the offer.
   Western Union said that as of midnight last Thursday,
about $328.6 million of the 19 1/4% notes had been tendered,
out of a total $500 million, and $5.9 million of the 16%
notes, out of a total $29.9 million, had been tendered.
   At 50 cents on the dollar, the company will have to pay
its noteholders roughly $167 million to cover the $334
million in notes that have been tendered. This will leave $8
million from the AT&amp;T payment, which Western Union will
retain, according to a Western Union spokesman. In addition,
to bring its interest payments current, Western Union will
pay about $37 million in interest to noteholders who did not
tender their notes in the offer, which it will pay with about
$50 million cash on hand.
   Western Union, which is nearly 140 years old, has suffered
from a steep decline in its telex business due to the
explosion in facsimile transmissions and heavy competition in
its money transfer and electronic mail operations. Telex and
E-mail will now become part of AT&amp;T's newly formed global
messaging unit, giving AT&amp;T about 40% of the world
electronic-mail market.
   Earlier in the year Western Union had tried to get its
bondholders to accept an exchange offer that would have
converted its $530 million in junk-bond debt into new stock
and debt securities and help it avoid bankruptcy-law
proceedings.
   However, in late November when bondholders -- led by Carl
Icahn, who holds about $70 million of the company's debt --
continued to hold out after numerous extensions of the offer
by the company, Western Union scratched the exchange and made
its all-cash tender offer.
