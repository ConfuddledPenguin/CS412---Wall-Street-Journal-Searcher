   I note (Politics &amp; Policy, Dec. 4) that Sen. Daniel Inouye
asserts that his "Keating Five" colleagues' actions in
support of a campaign contributor (Keating) were "vigorous,
but not improper." I submit that Sen. Inouye has no idea of
what does or does not represent proper conduct.
   Proper conduct in office is not a function of adhering to
rules and regulations; proper conduct is a question of
ethics, honesty and doing what is "right." The Keating Five
and most of Congress live by one simple rule: Do what you
have to do to remain in office. That the members of Congress
collectively justify their actions is a testimony to their
distorted view of what is right and wrong. It is no wonder
that to refer to an individual as a politician is to place in
question the person's honesty, integrity and personal goals.
