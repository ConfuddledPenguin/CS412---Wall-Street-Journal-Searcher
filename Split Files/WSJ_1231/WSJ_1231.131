   Recent reports in this paper describe the "flood" of
managerial cutbacks sweeping through America's leading
corporations. Executive and middle-management layoffs are
affecting thousands of people as companies across the country
downsize and retrench in light of economic gloom.
   Some of the soon-to-be unemployed are turning to corporate
business libraries for help. Over the years managers have
used corporate library resources for data collection and
other sources of information that have fed their activities
as analysts, planners, brokers and marketers. However, the
recent development of electronic directories of U.S. and
international businesses on CD-ROM (compact disk-read only
memory) have added a new dimension for library users. CD-ROM
is an optical disk technology that offers great information
storage potential. A typical disk can hold the text of
150,000 printed pages or the contents of 1,200 standard
5.25-inch diskettes.

   CD-ROM readers, coupled with commercially available disks
of corporate data purchased from business publishers, make an
impressive tool for the job seeker. This technology, which is
relatively inexpensive, requires just a personal computer,
CD-ROM drive, controller and printer. The data, coupled with
the technology, is now available in many corporate, public
and academic business libraries. Job seekers now are finding
that librarians can quickly and cheaply produce lists of job
leads, develop customer lists for new business opportunities,
or supply enough company data to build a personalized job
bank.
   For example, a manager in a company's corporate real
estate department, suspecting it was only a matter of time
before his termination, sought the librarian's assistance in
locating firms in other geographical regions with enough
corporate property to need someone with his experience. Using
CD-ROM directories of both public and private companies, the
librarian searched such criteria as number of employees,
subsidiaries, and key balance-sheet items to identify
job-search targets.
   The search produced a select universe of potential
employers. This list was then limited geographically to
cities in Virginia and the Carolinas, using telephone area
codes, and given to the manager for review.
   When the list was returned to the library by the manager,
the address and chief administrative officer's name for each
selected firm was downloaded into a PC computer file. The
file was then linked to a word processing program. A form
letter was written and run against the data file, producing
personalized letters to be sent to each firm on the edited
list. The entire operation took less than one hour of the
librarian's time and produced more than 100 personalized
letters for the manager. Even more important, the manager
received positive responses on many of his letters.
   In another instance, a recently fired senior executive in
the investment banking department approached the corporate
library for assistance identifying prospective customers for
a new business venture she was evaluating. She was
considering using severance pay as venture capital for her
own enterprise.
   Using CD-based library resources, the corporate librarian
was able to identify a range of potential customers by
segmenting publicly available corporate data by geographic
location, line of business, sales and other criteria -- at
virtually no additional expense to the former employer. In
other words, as sort of a severance bonus the executive was
able to walk away with both capital to begin a new business
and a segmented list of potential customers' companies,
executive names, addresses and phone numbers.
   Students in the nation's business schools are also turning
to the library to identify potential employers who don't
normally recruit on campus. Often these students are looking
for smaller firms or companies in specialized markets.
   Utilizing such sources as Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, financial statements, brokerage house
reports, market studies and other widely-held materials
available on CD, students are identifying companies as
employment prospects. Since all of these resources are
available through commercially available CD-ROM services, the
process of gathering data is significantly speeded up.
   Some of the primary vendors of business information on CD
are Disclosure Inc., Lotus Co., Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and
Standard &amp; Poor's. For the past several years Disclosure has
marketed its Compact Disclosure product. With updates
provided on a monthly basis, this disk contains extensive
information on over 12,000 public companies. Lotus, D&amp;B and
S&amp;P have produced similar products that incorporate extensive
information on both public and private companies.
   These CDs will often contain several years of
balance-sheet information, the full text of the president's
letter from the annual report to shareholders, a list of
senior officers and directors (including compensation), an
extensive breakdown of lines of business by either SIC code
or description, and, of course, the company address and phone
number. Many of the files also list subsidiaries and their
locations.
   Although each vendor's product is different, all do allow
searching on most of the data bases. That search capability
is what gives these systems their strength. By following
simple menus, users are able to search through data on
literally hundreds of thousands of companies to identify
targets for the job search.
   For example, by searching on balance-sheet items, a job
seeker can limit activity to companies of specific sizes. Or
by looking for words such as "reorganization" or "turnaround"
in the president's letter, target companies that might tap
the past experience of unemployed executives can be
identified.
   Some job seekers request that specific information, such
as the text of the president's letter, product descriptions,
lists of subsidiaries, and financial data -- the same sources
that are useful when analyzing a competitor's or supplier's
financial condition -- be printed from the disk on every
company targeted for the job search. As one production
manager, who was in the process of relocating to the New York
area noted, the printout results in a ready reference when
preparing for an interview.
