   Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, or ENI, the Italian
state-owned energy group, will launch on Wednesday its public
swap offer for the 20% of Enimont S.p.A., a chemical concern,
that it doesn't already own.
   The offer will run until Feb. 5, according to the Milan
Stock Brokers executive committee. ENI will issue 1.4
trillion lire ($1.21 billion) of four-year, floating-rate
bonds, each with a face value of 1,650 lire ($1.43), for each
of the 850 million Enimont shares still on the market. The
first six-month coupon, payable next August, was set at 6.4%.
The yield is linked to the average yield of a basket of
government securities and the three-month interbank rate.

   ENI owns 80% of Enimont; it bought out its former partner,
Montedison S.p.A. in November. The bond issue is part of the
complete nationalization of the chemical group. ENI has said
an undetermined part of Enimont may be refloated on the
market in the future.
