   Voter turnout is supposed to be an indicator of the
public's support for democratic institutions, so the
declining voter turnout in American elections has raised deep
concern. The most commonly advanced explanation for the
decline in voter turnout is that voters have been
disillusioned by Vietnam and Watergate, the rise of PACs and
negative campaigning. This explanation is almost certainly
wrong. Analyses of election survey data collected by the
University of Michigan's Survey Research Center show that
respondents with high levels of political cynicism and low
trust in government vote at nearly the same rate as
respondents with high trust and low cynicism.
   So why don't Americans vote? Instead of viewing the issue
of voter turnout in a narrowly political context, think of
voting as just one particular type of socially cooperative
behavior. What all of these types of behavior have in common
is a conflict for the individual between the course of action
that would be beneficial to every member of the group of
which the individual is a part and the narrow self-interest
of the individual himself. Individuals can be taught to
identify their interest with that of the group as a whole,
and this can lead to beneficial outcomes for everybody. But
that teaching seems not to be working any longer, because
socially cooperative behavior generally has been declining in
the U.S. over the past 30 years.

   In 1960, 63% of eligible voters cast ballots in the
presidential election. That figure fell steadily to 50% in
the 1988 election. The 36.4% turnout in the 1990
congressional elections matched the record low in 1986.
   At the same time, fewer Americans are bothering to become
informed citizens. Daily newspaper readership fell to 51% of
adults in 1988 from 73% in 1967. The combined Nielsen rating
of the three major networks' evening news programs is down by
about 25% from its levels of 10 years ago. The increasing
popularity of cable news programs accounts for only a small
fraction of network news' decline.
   The response rate to the Census fell to about 63% in 1990
from about 75% in 1980. There is a near perfect match between
Census responsiveness and voting: States with the lowest
rates of cooperation with the Census also had the lowest
turnouts.
   Survey researchers at the Michigan Survey Center and
elsewhere report a gradual rise over the past few decades in
the number of subjects contacted who refuse to be
interviewed. There is good evidence that these nonrespondents
tend to be nonvoters also.
   Crime is obviously uncooperative behavior. And crime rates
are sharply up from their levels of 30 years ago. It also
turns out that at both the state and the neighborhood level,
the higher the crime rate the lower the voter turnout rate.
   The Higher Education Research Institute at the University
of California at Los Angeles has conducted nationwide surveys
of college freshmen since 1966. The percentage of students
admitting to cheating on exams has risen steadily to 36.6% in
1988 from 20.6% in 1966.
   Controlling for income, tax inducements and other
variables, charitable contributions have trended downward
since 1948 -- a drop that has accelerated in more recent
years.
   Similarly, income tax compliance has fallen since
estimates were first compiled by the IRS in 1963.
   Americans are becoming more mistrustful of their
fellow-citizens. Since 1964, surveys have asked respondents
whether they believe that "most people can be trusted" or,
alternatively, that "you can't be too careful in dealing with
people." In all three polls conducted in the 1960s that asked
this question, at least 53% of respondents agreed that people
were generally trustworthy. In the 17 surveys conducted since
1970, the figure reached as high as 51% only once (in 1976),
and has often dipped into the upper thirties.
   Finally, the fall in voter turnout is consistent with
widespread impressions of a decline in "common" courtesy,
more frequent violations of driver etiquette and even with an
observed increase in the self-glorification of college and
professional athletes. In all of these instances, individuals
are choosing courses of action that are in their own
self-interest (narrowly defined) over actions that benefit
all the members of society.
   People act in the interests of society as a whole
surprisingly often, motivated both by "internal" sanctions
such as guilt, and "external" sanctions such as ostracism. A
recent study by Tom Tyler of Northwestern University argues
that compliance even with criminal law is influenced more by
feelings of obligation and by peer disapproval than by the
fear of prison. While many explanations could conceivably be
offered to account for the downward trend in each individual
form of cooperative behavior, a theory that focused on the
weakening of the "internal" and "external" sanctions that
control selfish behavior would explain a lot with a little.
   Although voter participation has always been lower among
those lacking an interest in politics or a sense of civic
obligation, the decline in turnout since 1960 has been
especially large among this group. This pattern is exactly
what would be expected if voting is a response to pressures
from family, neighbors and community institutions such as
churches. People who vote primarily because of the
expectations of others will be the first to drop out of the
electorate when the expectations of others begin to matter
less.
   And there is evidence that Americans are less susceptible
to the pressures of others than they used to be. Surveys
indicate, for example, that Americans feel slightly less
obliged to vote than they did in 1960 -- a response that came
as a considerable surprise to political scientists, because
of the sizable gains during the past 30 years in the
population's average years of education, with which civic
duty measures are closely associated. A 1989 study by People
for the American Way found the diminishing sense of civic
obligation to be most pronounced among young people.
   As fewer Americans live in the town in which they grew up,
people seem (insofar as it can be measured) to be spending
less time socializing with their parents, siblings and
neighbors. Church membership declined to 65% in 1988 from 73%
in 1965, and church attendance has similarly fallen.
   Census figures also show a rise in the number of single
adults: 37.3% of all adults in 1988, up from 26.8% in 1965.
Married people, like churchgoers and people who interact a
lot with their neighbors, are found in virtually all studies
to vote at significantly higher rates than unmarried people
of the same age and income.
   Fewer than 5% of contemporary American families include at
least one extra adult in the house -- such as a grandparent,
aunt or uncle -- compared to about one-half of families early
in the century. To the extent that bequest motives influence
personal savings decisions, a weakening of intergenerational
family ties is consistent with the recent plunge in the
savings rate to record lows.
   The proportion of one-parent families more than doubled to
23.1% of families with children in 1988 from 11.1% in 1970.
In 1960 only 18.6% of married mothers with children under 6
worked outside the home; this figure had increased to 57.1%
by 1988. For married mothers with children between 6 and 17,
the labor force participation rate rose to 72.5% from 39%
over the same period.
   James Coleman of the University of Chicago has argued that
increasing urbanization and high mobility rates may impede
the internalization of cooperative norms by children. A
child's misbehavior as an adult is less able to harm the
family's interests than in an earlier era, when children
often lived their entire lives in the same small communities
they were raised in.
   Predictions of a rebound in civic mindedness are thus both
misguided and naive. The belief that civic involvement is
cyclical, as Arthur Schlesinger and others have argued, has
little to support it, either theoretically or empirically.
   The view that trends in cooperative behavior merely
reflect autonomously changing tastes and preferences -- as if
the subject were dress lengths -- appears less plausible year
by year. In spite of periodic attempts in the media to
proclaim an end to the era of selfishness -- see Newsweek's
Jan. 4, 1988, cover story "The End of Greed" -- there are few
signs of improvement in any of the indicators of civic
mindedness.
