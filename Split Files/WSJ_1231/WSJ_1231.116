   Barclays Bank PLC, the largest commercial bank in Britain,
said it completed the acquisition of a 51% stake in
L'Europeenne de Banque, the banking arm of Credit Commercial
de France of France.
   The bank, which confirmed Dec. 13 that it had made a
conditional offer to CCF for the unit, founded in 1817, also
said it signed a letter of intent to acquire the balance of
the French institution's interest by early 1991. It said the
total value of the transaction, once completed, is 1.5
billion French francs ($288.5 million).

   Under the pact, approved by the French government,
Barclays acquired 16 private and retail banking offices in
France and a controlling interest in an operation with 14.1
billion francs of total assets. The deal includes the Paris
head office of L'Europeenne de Banque; Barclays said its
French unit, Barclays Bank S.A., will consolidate operations
there and dispose of its own Paris headquarters. Barclays
said the acquisition will help it double its French retail
banking market share and raise its French branch operations
to 70.
