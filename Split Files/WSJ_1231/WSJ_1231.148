   Contrary to Chris Whittle's assertions in your Nov. 26
article "Whittle Asserts School-TV Project Draws
Subscribers," California continues to ban the use of
advertising programs such as "Channel One" in our
public-school classrooms.
   State law has never given schools the ability to barter
access to their students for television or any other kind of
equipment. In addition, the law is quite clear that the state
will not pay schools for the time "Channel One" viewers spend
watching ads for M&amp;Ms.

   Whittle Communications' lobbyists tried, and failed, to
get a special-interest bill through the legislature. The law
remains as before. The State Board of Education, after
intense lobbying by Whittle's representative, did pass a
resolution stating that local school boards' decisions
regarding "commercial products and services" must be
"consistent with state law." Whittle Communications may
characterize that as a flip-flop. It is not.
   This state's PTA and the associations of school board
members and administrators support the continued ban of
broadcast advertising in the classroom. The state will soon
cut aid to the one public school that has used "Channel One"
since the beginning of the year.
   Beyond the local legal issues, the "Channel One"
controversy has raised serious educational and ethical
concerns, including the piecemeal selling of the school day
and the improper use of the compulsory-attendance law. It has
also focused attention on sales techniques that, while quite
legitimate in the free market, become exploitative in the
protected, monopoly environment in which Whittle
Communications seeks to operate.
