   IF NATHAN Edelson has his way, man will return not to the
sea but to the floor.
   Mr. Edelson, a designer in Missoula, Mont., has put
together a three-piece set -- two foam cushions and a little
wooden desk -- that he hopes home office workers will use
instead of chairs and big desks. With his Wedge System,
people can sit or lie on the floor, in various positions,
while using a laptop computer or doing other tasks.
   Mr. Edelson says the Wedge would allow the nation's five
million laptop users to keep their backs in "mild to moderate
extension" for some of the working day, counteracting what he
calls the harmful effects of conventional seating. It would
also encourage them to change their position frequently,
avoiding postural strains.
   Ergonomic chairs, he says, don't work, because people
don't sit the way the designers wish they would, back pressed
flat against the protruding lumbar surfaces.
   Today's office workers are subject to bodily restraint,
social isolation and mental monotony for eight hours daily,
says Mr. Edelson. The Wedge office is more in keeping with
the "leisure-oriented, high-excitement environment" that
people have come to expect when not on the job, he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Landfills Become Parks
   As Refuse Goes Green
                                                                                                       

   CITIES AND TOWNS struggle to turn garbage into parks.
   Landfills often represent the cheapest land around. Land
costs in the San Francisco area are $500,000 to $750,000 an
acre, says Glenn Lyles, manager of the Shoreline Park in
Mountain View, Calif. "So people are willing to take some
chances."
   The chances people take in converting a dump into a park
include land subsiding unevenly (as different garbage decays
at different rates), toxic chemicals leaching out and methane
gas escaping. State and federal rules often require expensive
devices to contain or collect leachate and methane.
   Kearny, N.J., plans to turn its 57-acre dump into a kind
of newage Stonehenge by lining up the steel methane recovery
towers with the sun, moon and major stars at important
celestial events. Ninety percent of the money Palo Alto,
Calif., is spending on Byxbee Park goes to comply with state
requirements on leachate and methane. The rest is being used
to build various artworks, including a forest of telephone
poles and giant earthen chevrons that line up with a runway
at the city airport.
   Mountain View's 700-acre Shoreline Park, which includes a
golf course, amphitheater and sailing pond, has been built on
13 years of San Francisco's garbage, for which Mountain View
received $17 million. Revenues from golf, sailing and sales
of methane to utilities pay for the park's operation.
   Turning garbage into parks needn't be expensive.
Lexington, Mass., spent $385,000 of public and private money
converting an 18-acre dump and adjacent wetlands into a
60-acre park, which includes playing fields, paths, a
wildflower meadow, fitness stations and ponds.
   Landscape designer Nell Walker says the park's low budget
was possible because the dump had been closed 20 years. The
land had subsided, most of the methane had dissipated and the
household chemicals of 20 years ago were less toxic than
today's, says Ms. Walker.
                                                                                                       

   Like the Pie Itself,
   This Box Goes to Pieces
                                                                                                       

   THE PIZZA BOX is undergoing change to make it more
convenient and environment-friendly.
   Eric Crockett of Toledo, Ohio, has redesigned the top of
the box, adding perforations that allow the top to be
separated into four "plates." The flaps form sides, which can
be grasped with thumb and index finger through holes. Mr.
Crockett says his design saves washing dishes and makes the
pizza box easier to fold for disposal.
   Domino's Pizza, which delivers 250 million pizzas a year,
recently shaved off the corners of its box, turning a square
into an octagon. The re-design, by Stone Container of
Chicago, was aimed at saving material and money, giving the
pizza less room to slide around, retaining more heat and
strengthening the box.
   PepsiCo's Pizza Hut subsidiary says it's using more
recycled paper in its pizza boxes, napkins and other paper
products. Roger Rydell, the company's director of public
affairs, says Pizza Hut is also exploring whether it could
reduce the weight of its box without making it too floppy.
   Randy Love, sales vice president for Love Box, Wichita,
Kan., says pizza makers have shown little imagination in
their boxes. He praises Eric Crockett's new design as "great
use of a box."
