   Crowds may be clogging the civil federal courts, but don't
blame just the lawyers. Instead, try roomfuls of contentious
corporate types.
   That's the message of two law professors from the
University of Wisconsin who recently completed a study of
business litigation in federal civil courts.

   Advocates of tort, or liability, reform insist that the
overburdened justice system has been caused by overeager
lawyers flooding the courts with product-liability and other
cases brought against corporations by individuals. But
professors Marc Galanter and Joel Rogers argue that the blame
has been misplaced. The boom in corporate litigation --
complaints brought by businesses against each other -- has
been virtually ignored, they say.
   "There is a tremendous resistance to this idea. It just
goes against the picture of the world {tort reformers} have
built up," says Mr. Galanter, a well-known expert on
litigation trends.
   The study concludes that companies are resorting to
litigation to solve problems they traditionally negotiated
informally. For example, the study reports that contract
cases between corporations in federal court grew to 6,277 in
1986 from 518 in 1971, an increase of 1,112%. The researchers
found there were sharp increases in litigation between firms
and any entity they came into contact with, including
suppliers, distributors, creditors, competitors, customers
and the government.
   Suits involving misleading advertising, claims of civil
racketeering, bankruptcy law and intellectual property rights
also have increased sharply, the study says.
   The two law professors claim:
   -- Contract disputes have displaced torts (suits alleging
wrongful action) as the most frequently filed civil suits in
federal courts. Between 1960 and 1988, the number of contract
cases filed each year jumped 232%, as tort litigation rose
128%.
   -- Businesses now pay more than individuals do for
litigation and other law-related expenses, and corporate
expenditures on legal services have recently grown at twice
the rate of what individuals are spending. And corporate law
firms emphasize litigation over routine business, more than
ever before.
   -- Businesses are more often suing each other than
individuals or government.
   -- Large law firms serving corporate clients have grown
faster than any other segment of the legal profession. The
in-house legal staffs of corporations have grown
correspondingly.
   Mr. Galanter found a receptive audience when he presented
his findings in November at the annual meeting of the
American Corporate Counsel Association, a national
organization of in-house lawyers, in San Francisco. Lawrence
A. Salibra II, the chairman of the group's litigation
committee, says that companies too often rely on litigation
to solve what are essentially management problems.
   "The business community is overdependent on lawyers," says
Mr. Salibra, senior litigation counsel for Alcan Aluminum
Corp., in Cleveland. "They can take a problem, pass it on to
lawyers and forget about it -- at least for the short term."
   Other in-house lawyers say businesses have come to think
of litigation as a management strategy. "If you couldn't
negotiate, you can sue," says Carl Liggio, general counsel
for the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young. He adds that
long-term business relationships are no longer as important
as they used to be. "You had a much more closed business
society," says Mr. Liggio of Ernst &amp; Young. "There was an
old-boy network. If there was a problem, you didn't put the
dispute out in the public domain."
   But Mr. Galanter goes beyond the notion that managers have
abdicated too much of their responsibility to lawyers. The
study attributes the surge in business litigation to a host
of economic factors such as product specialization,
heightened competition and the increased complexity of
business transactions.
   The study is likely to stoke an already heated debate
among legal scholars over what accounts for the litigation
boom. Mr. Galanter's critics concede that there has been a
surge in businesses suing each other. But they contend that
is only part of a larger increase in litigation brought on by
liberal changes in court procedures and the expansion of
damage and liability theories that have made it easier -- and
potentially more lucrative -- to sue.
   These critics see the growth of litigation in general as a
crisis that has overburdened courts and victimized
businesses. They have primarily blamed avaricious lawyers and
indulgent judges.
   "We've grown more and more permissive about who can go to
court," complains Peter Huber, a critic of Mr. Galanter and
author of "Liability: The Legal Revolution and Its
Consequences."
   Critics also fault the new study for analyzing only
federal court trends. In their study, Messrs. Galanter and
Rogers argue that "there is a substantial amount of business
disputing in state courts as well," but that no aggregate
data exist to make the comparison.
   Others also say that Mr. Galanter's study misses the
point: Tort litigation, they claim, has still been disastrous
for business. He "may be right" that too many businessmen are
suing each other, says Frank McFadden, a former federal judge
and general counsel for manufacturer Blount Inc., of
Montgomery, Ala. "But that's not the real issue in tort
reform. It's the result and the impact that tort litigation
has on industry. The cost of defending the product is so
great that many companies have just stopped manufacturing. .
. ."
   Even so, "it seems clear that business has a much greater
capacity for litigation than it did 20 years ago and that a
rising number of business disputes are not being resolved by
the parties themselves but are being brought to courts,"
concludes Mr. Galanter.
   Adds Mr. Salibra: "When I brought the first lawsuit by
Alcan against another business in a breach-of-contract case,
it was like a major emotional experience. It used to be
considered sacrilegious. . . . It's commonplace now."
