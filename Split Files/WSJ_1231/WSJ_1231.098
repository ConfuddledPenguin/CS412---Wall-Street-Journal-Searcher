   REPLY FROM MRS. AQUINO

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino said her government
would meet conditions set by a Swiss court for the return of
money allegedly deposited in Switzerland by the late
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   In a decision made public last week, the Swiss Supreme
Court ruled that the money must be returned as soon as a
competent criminal court in the Philippines has issued a
"legally binding" verdict in a case against Mr. Marcos and
his widow, Imelda. The order set a one-year deadline for the
Philippine government to complete legal proceedings.
   "The decision of Switzerland's Federal Supreme Court
should be hailed as a victory for the Filipino people," Mrs.
Aquino said. "For our part, we are confident that we will be
able to fulfill the conditions within the time frame
available."
   The Aquino government claims that Mr. Marcos and his
associates embezzled up to $10 billion.
                                                                                                       

   FRANCE RESUMES CHINA CREDIT
                                                                                                       

   France agreed to restore official lines of credit for
projects in China managed by French companies that were
suspended after China suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations
last year. In Paris, an Economics Ministry official said a
protocol signed by China and France would release 1.3 billion
francs ($253.6 million) of loans to help finance
telecommunications and water-treatment projects.
                                                                                                       

   TOKYO PHONE NUMBERS ADD DIGIT
                                                                                                       

   Telephone numbers in Tokyo are adding one digit to become
eight-digit numbers, beginning tomorrow at 2 a.m., Japan
time. All phone numbers in Tokyo's 03 area code are adding
the number "3" before the present seven-digit number. The
change affects 6.14 million numbers of the total 7.18 million
numbers in Tokyo. The 1.04 million numbers unaffected by the
change were previously changed to eight-digit numbers,
starting with the digit "5."
   Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. is taking the step to
increase the numbers available for use.
                                                                                                       

   VENEZUELA CHANGES SAVINGS TAX
                                                                                                       

   Venezuela's Planning Minister Miguel Rodriguez said most
savings accounts would be exempt from a new tax planned by
the government in 1991. The government plans for the first
time to tax interest from personal savings accounts but only
when the accounts exceed the equivalent of $10,000. The
original plan was to tax accounts above $5,000. The tax is
expected to be about 2%.
                                                                                                       

   COSTS BALLOON IN BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   Inflation in Brazil in December hit 19.39%, up from a
November rate of 16.64%, according to the official index. The
consumer price index, a separate, unofficial measure, showed
an increase of 18.3% in December and a record 1,795% for the
year. In December, price increases were led by pharmaceutical
products, which rose 50%. The government ordered an
investigation of what it called "perverse" increases by drug
companies, and the industry last week voluntarily agreed to
freeze its prices for 45 days. Also contributing to the
December jump were rents, which rose 38%, and bus fares,
which climbed 22%.
                                                                                                       

   RECALL OF JAPANESE COSMETICS
                                                                                                       

   Shiseido Co., a Japanese cosmetics maker, said its
Australian and Singapore subsidiaries are recalling six
skin-care products containing urocanic acid, an
ultraviolet-absorbing material that an Australian researcher
linked to skin cancer. A Shiseido spokesman said urocanic
acid has been approved as safe by Japan, the U.S. and other
nations. Shiseido doesn't plan to recall the products
elsewhere. The spokesman said an Australian government
advisory on Dec. 18 urged a recall; while no similar action
was taken in Singapore, the local subsidiary decided on the
recall after media coverage of the Australian action.
                                                                                                       

   BEIJING RAISES SOME PRICES
                                                                                                       

   Beginning tomorrow, residents of Beijing will have to pay
double the current fare for bus and subway tickets and up to
10 times today's price to stroll in a park as the city tries
to reduce subsidies.
   The new rates still fail to cover the city's costs to run
the public-transit and parks systems, the Beijing Evening
News said. But it didn't indicate whether further increases
were likely soon.
   Even for Chinese, the new rates remain relatively low. A
bus ride across the central city will cost three cents, for
example, or less than 3% of the average worker's daily wages.
Most city parks have charged less than one cent for entry and
now will charge nine cents.
   China has selectively increased prices over the past
decade in an effort to reduce the burden of subsidies. But
authorities have failed to overhaul the entire price system,
as economists have urged, for fear of causing social unrest.

   The Italian Treasury is issuing a 1,000-lire bill with a
picture of educator Maria Montessori, replacing the
traditional portrait of explorer Marco Polo. A thousand lire
are worth about 86 cents. . . . Argentine soccer star Diego
Maradona was voted Italy's most hated person in a year-end
poll conducted for La Repubblica newspaper. Mr. Maradona, who
is captain of the Napoli team, was called "a troublemaker, a
hypocrite and a sower of discord." He headed a list including
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Bush and rock
singer Madonna.
