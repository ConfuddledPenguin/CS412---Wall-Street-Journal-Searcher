   General Motors Corp., faced with a threatened boycott by
the city of San Francisco over a slur against gays in a
promotional video, has issued a company directive barring
discrimination or insults against homosexuals.
   The directive was made in an effort to appease angry gays
in San Francisco and other cities over an internal video
shown by GM's Chevrolet unit last September, which contained
a reference to a foreign competitor's product as "that little
faggot truck."

   Upon learning of the video through news reports, the city
of San Francisco, home to a powerful gay lobby, threatened to
rescind its contract with GM for about $500,000 a year in
cars and trucks, unless the auto maker could show how it
would avoid discriminating against gays in the future. San
Francisco, which received letters of support from around the
country, acted under a city ordinance that bans
discrimination against homosexuals.
   In addition to notifying San Francisco officials last week
about its new directive, the company, in its December
newsletter, condemned discrimination against gays. Also, GM
Chairman Robert C. Stempel has sent a letter of apology to
the city of San Francisco.
   "I want to assure you that this singular unfortunate
incident does not reflect General Motors policies, practices
or attitudes toward lesbian and gay people," Mr. Stempel
wrote in the Nov. 6 letter to San Francisco Supervisor
Richard Hongisto, who led the protest against the slur.
   In San Francisco, city officials said they were "pleased"
with GM's actions and were inclined to lift the threat of a
boycott -- as long as GM can demonstrate how the
non-discrimination policy will be implemented. The directive,
issued Nov. 29 to GM managers nationwide, states only that
each "employing unit" will be charged with carrying out the
policy.
   "We feel that General Motors at its highest leadership has
demonstrated a sincere commitment to undo the damage that has
been done, and we feel their efforts are laudable and
sincere," said T.J. Anthony, administrative aide to Mr.
Hongisto.
   The city would also like GM officials to consider
contributing money to a national organization that fights
discrimination against gays.
   GM officials weren't available for comment Friday. But in
his letter to the city, Mr. Stempel explained that GM didn't
intentionally include the "faggot" reference in the video,
shown during an internal marketing show in Detroit.
   GM officials have said that the slur was made by a
customer being interviewed for the video on why he preferred
Chevrolet products over smaller foreign models. In his
letter, Mr. Stempel said the interview was aired along with a
number of other customer interviews.
   Although Detroit-based GM already has an
anti-discrimination policy, the new directive adds protection
regardless of one's sexual orientation.
   "Abuse of the dignity of anyone through slurs or other
derogatory or objectionable conduct, including that based on
sexual orientation, is offensive employee behavior and has no
place in General Motors," said the directive by R.F. O'Brien,
vice-president of industrial relations staff, and G.A.
Knechtel, vice-president of personnel, administration and
development staff.
