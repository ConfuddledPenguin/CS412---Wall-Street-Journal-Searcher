   HOMEPLEX MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS Corp., Phoenix, Ariz., said
it obtained a $50 million, three-year term loan and will
resume paying quarterly dividends in the first quarter of
1991. The real estate investment trust, which didn't disclose
the amount of the next dividend, last paid a dividend of 50
cents on Jan. 30, 1990. The company said it used the first
$20 million of proceeds, plus other short-term borrowings of
$5.7 million, to repay $25.7 million of indebtedness
outstanding under its existing loan agreement maturing on
Feb. 1. The company plans to use additional proceeds from the
loan to repay the remainder of its short-term indebtedness.
The term loan will reduce the company's overall borrowing
costs, Homeplex said.
