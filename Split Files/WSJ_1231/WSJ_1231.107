   Indonesian tycoon Liem Sioe Liong has gained control of
Singapore's diversified United Industrial Corp. with a share
purchase that surprised analysts.
   UIC's president, Oei Hong Leong, sold 182 million shares
at 1.60 Singapore dollars (91 U.S. cents) each to Mr. Liem's
Singapore investment company. The S$291.2 million transaction
reduces Mr. Oei's stake to 4.7% from 22.4%. The holding of
Mr. Liem's KMP Pte. rises to 24.5% from 6.7%.

   Mr. Oei is also stepping down as UIC's president and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Liem's Salim Group, Indonesia's largest conglomerate,
has more than 200 companies involved in banking, trading,
manufacturing, property and other activities. Headed by the
74-year-old Mr. Liem, Salim has been steadily expanding its
activities in Singapore. Now, Salim will in effect get
control of a large block of Singapore's commercial real
estate: UIC controls the country's largest
commercial-property company, Singapore Land Ltd.
   Neither Mr. Liem nor Mr. Oei could be reached for comment
on the transaction.
