   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Orion Pictures Corp. agreed to give
its majority shareholder a cut of profits from the movie
"Mermaids" in return for a $23 million investment.
   Shareholder John W. Kluge and his partner Stuart
Subotnick, executive vice president of Mr. Kluge's Metromedia
Co., will receive up to 64% of certain profits from the
movie, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

   In addition, the filing indicates the pair may receive
certain profits from Orion's next scheduled release, "The
Silence of the Lambs," should receipts from "Mermaids" prove
disappointing.
   The romantic comedy starring Cher and Winona Ryder grossed
$8.3 million over the Christmas holiday weekend.
   An Orion spokeswoman would not comment on the $23 million
investment -- in the form of a joint venture called
MetMermaids -- saying she could not reach top executives for
an explanation.
   Mr. Kluge holds about 70% of Orion shares.
   Orion recently retained the New York investment banking
firm Salomon Brothers to find new sources of money.
