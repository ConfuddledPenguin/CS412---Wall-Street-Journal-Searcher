   THE HAGUE -- As European insurers and banks pair off
frantically, Aegon N.V. is playing hard to get.
   The Dutch insurance company -- No. 2 in its home market
and one of the biggest foreign insurers in the U.S. -- now is
putting a higher priority on expansion in Europe, where
national barriers are giving way to freer competition. To
cope with what is expected to be a fierce scrap for market
share, many insurance companies are joining forces with other
insurers or banks.

   N.V. Amev, the Netherlands' third-largest insurer, earlier
this month completed a merger with Groupe AG, the No. 1
Belgian insurance concern. Meanwhile, Nationale Nederlanden
N.V., the biggest Dutch insurer, is proposing to merge with
NMB Postbank Groep N.V., a Dutch bank-holding company.
   That leaves Aegon conspicuously alone on the sidelines.
But Aegon's feisty chairman, Jaap Peters, is no wallflower.
He insists that the company, whose earnings growth has easily
topped that of its Dutch rivals in the past few years,
doesn't need a partner.
   On the other hand, he adds in an interview, "we are open
for discussions."
   Although Mr. Peters is coy about his company's intentions,
he suggests two options that might tempt Aegon into the
mating dance:
   -- Some form of alliance with another sizable insurer to
improve Aegon's geographical spread. The company now derives
about 90% of its revenue from the Netherlands and the U.S.
One of Aegon's priorities is to expand in Southern Europe.
   -- The acquisition of a minority stake in a bank or other
financial institution that could help channel certain kinds
of insurance to customers.
   Mr. Peters says Aegon has had "contacts" with potential
partners, but he cautions against expecting too much. "There
is an overestimation of what is possible" in terms of
attractive alliances, he says.
   In the "top league" of European insurers, Mr. Peters says,
"the number of players is maybe 15."
   Mr. Peters clearly believes that this elite includes
Aegon. Created by the 1983 merger between two Dutch insurers,
the company is based in a drab suburb of The Hague, where its
headquarters resembles a swank American shopping mall,
complete with a five-story marble atrium.
   Revenue totaled 11.75 billion guilders (about $7 billion)
last year. Over the past three years, earnings per share
advanced by an average of 11% annually, and Amsterdam
brokerage firm Van Meer James Capel N.V. sees increases of
about 10% this year and 7% in 1991.
   In recent years, earnings growth has come partly from the
cost-saving benefits of the 1983 merger. In the years ahead,
some analysts expect Aegon's earnings growth to slow markedly
unless it can find a new engine for expansion.
   Predominately a life-insurance company, Aegon still earns
about two-thirds of its profit in the Netherlands, even
though the home market accounts for only a little over half
of world-wide revenue. As the Dutch market is saturated,
prospects for growth there are limited.
   It is unclear whether Aegon's biggest Dutch rival,
Nat-Ned, will succeed in its plan to merge with NMB Postbank.
Opposition from Nat-Ned's shareholders and independent agents
has been surprisingly strong. If the merger does go through,
however, Postbank's 2,500 banking outlets and 5.5 million
Dutch clients could be a powerful tool for Nat-Ned to sell
certain types of basic insurance cheaply.
   "The retail network of Postbank is unique," says E.J.
Huijboom, an analyst at Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson N.V., who
figures that weapon will provide a big edge in the long term
to whichever insurer wins it.
   Aegon's other big Dutch rival, Amev, already has a savings
bank unit, VSB Groep, to help it reach more clients.
   For its part, Aegon says it can continue to rely on
selling insurance almost exclusively through agents. But some
analysts are skeptical and fear Aegon will lose market share.
   Should the Nat-Ned merger plan fall through, analysts
believe Aegon might try to form some kind of joint venture
with NMB Postbank. Aegon's Mr. Peters allows that his company
has long thought -- in a "theoretical" way -- about some sort
of cooperation with NMB Postbank.
   Outside the Netherlands, Aegon is focusing on growth along
the Mediterranean, from Portugal to Turkey. Already, Aegon is
heavily involved in Spain, where it has acquired three
companies over the past decade and is one of the country's
top 10 insurers. This year, Aegon moved into Portugal,
starting up a small insurance company from scratch. In
Greece, Aegon has a 51% stake in Aspis-Pronia Insurance Co.,
which is mainly a life insurer.
   Aegon continues to look for possible acquisitions or
partners in Italy and Turkey, Mr. Peters says. So do many of
his rivals. When an insurance company is auctioned off in
Southern Europe, prices are at least twice as high as they
are in the U.S., Mr. Peters says.
   Aegon is an old hand at acquisitions in the U.S., where
its biggest operating companies are Monumental Life
Insurance, National Old Line Insurance and Life Investors
Insurance. Excluding Canadian companies, Aegon says it is the
biggest foreign insurer in the U.S. in terms of assets. Most
of the U.S. profits come from life insurance. Aegon's record
in U.S. group-health insurance has been disappointing, partly
because of soaring medical costs, but Mr. Peters says the
situation is improving.
   As the U.S. financial-services industry flounders, more
acquisition opportunities are likely to open up there. Mr.
Peters says Aegon will be watching for them.
