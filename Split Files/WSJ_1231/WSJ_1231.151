   Making New Year's resolutions tonight?
   Wall Street suggests adding these to your list, with an
eye toward making 1991, if not more prosperous, at least less
painful.

   Sell stocks.
   Buy bonds.
   Reduce debt.
   Avoid holding cash.
   Shun art and gold.
   Invest for the long haul.
   "Investors should resolve to use this rally in stocks that
we've seen in the past few months to sell their stocks," says
A. Gary Shilling, an economist and money manager in
Springfield, N.J. Mr. Shilling figures the economy is mired
in a recession that might not end until 1992, a scenario that
would lambast the stock market with the exception of
high-quality utility stocks with good dividends.
   And while you're selling those stocks, he advises, use the
proceeds to buy long-term Treasury bonds. Although bond
prices have already risen substantially in 1990, he figures
the depth and severity of the recession will result in
further declines in interest rates, driving bond prices even
higher.
   Mr. Shilling's longtime pessimism about the economy stems
from his view that many of the factors that often enable the
economy to grow its way out of a recession in a few quarters
aren't present this time around.
   Take the debt levels of both consumers and corporations.
They're so high that even if banks were inclined to lend --
and there's no evidence that they are -- nobody wants to
borrow. This means that housing, one of the industries that
usually leads the economy out of recession, isn't likely to
play the same role this time. And with all the commercial
real estate hitting the market as the Resolution Trust Corp.
tries to liquidate the savings and loan mess, the commercial
real estate market will be in the dumps for years, Mr.
Shilling says.
   Then there's the service industry, usually a pillar of
strength in times of recession. Trouble is, service companies
haven't done much to improve productivity in the past several
years, says Mr. Shilling, and that's going to hurt this time
around. The travel and recreation industries, for example,
are very vulnerable to a consumer retrenchment because their
services are highly postponable. And businesses will find it
much easier to cut back or eliminate such outside services as
lawyers, accountants and, yes, economic consultants than to
fire full-time employees, he says.
   As a period of sustained deflation sets in, tangible
goods, such as art and gold, won't be good places to hide, he
adds. "Look at the way the art market is falling off" and
gold hasn't gone anywhere despite the Middle East crisis, he
says. That, in turn, will crimp spending habits among even
the wealthiest individuals, who in the past seemed to escape
recessions unscathed.
   "The argument historically has been that the fat cats keep
buying come hell or high water," says Mr. Shilling. "But what
people don't realize is that the fat cats have an awful lot
of their net assets in tangible form."
   Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch, is looking for hard times ahead, too, albeit not a
recession that stretches into 1992. He's resolved that bonds
are the place to be as the new year opens, a recommendation
that Merrill Lynch has been making for months. "We've been on
the Treasury bond case as long as Carter has been making
Little Liver Pills, but we still think the case is sound," he
says. "For every dollar of stocks you own, you should have a
dollar of bonds sitting next to it."
   And the stocks he recommends are utilities, which provide
some income through their lucrative dividends. "Locking in
income is not a bad way to go," he says. He thinks that over
the course of the next year the dividend yields on utility
stocks, now nearly twice as large as the yields on industrial
stocks, will come down as the utility stock prices rise.
   Perhaps one of the toughest resolutions to stick to in the
New Year is Mr. Clough's warning to avoid cash. "Cash is a
trap," he says. "Investors have gotten good returns for 12
years in short-term instruments and it's very hard to break a
habit like that. But short-term rates simply have to drop
sharply. If banks are not lending, they can't afford to pay
much to get your deposits."
   Most investors claim to be investing for the long run, but
1991 is the year in which you had better mean what you say,
says Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany
Corp. He expects both the economy and the stock market to
have a rough ride in 1991, with some bounces up that will
lure back unwary investors before it is time.
   "There could be a variety of economic indicators that lift
spirits, or confidence could begin to recover because of some
kind of political event like a settlement in the Middle
East," he says. "That would all be reflected in higher stock
prices, but what I'm warning is that those signals, important
as they may have been in the past, are likely to be false
signals."
   Like other advisers, Mr. Johnson expects this recession to
differ from previous downturns. He notes, for instance, that
in prior downturns the economy usually showed signs of
recovery some eight to 10 months after the Federal Reserve
began lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing. But
this time it has already been nearly 20 months since the Fed
began paring rates, and still the economy is headed down
while banks balk at making new loans.
   "The economic system has become so fragile and borrowers
have taken on so much debt that you're not likely to see any
pickup in borrowing anytime soon," he says. "It's going to be
a very nerve-wracking year."

   Friday Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 3.71 points higher
Friday at 2629.21.
   Traders said the market averages drifted with narrow
losses, then turned higher late in the day on activity
related to year-end "window dressing" of portfolios. Losing
stocks outnumbered gainers, 800 to 712. Trading was the most
active of the week but Friday's volume was still low at
111,040,000 shares.
   For the week, the industrial average lost 4.45 points, or
a slim 0.17%. Traders didn't read much into the market's
failure to mount a rally in the final days of the year. Two
trading sessions were shorter than normal in a week already
truncated by the Christmas holiday.
   American Express was unchanged at 20 3/8. The stock was
down for most of the day after a Heard On The Street column
said that the company's Shearson Lehman Brothers unit might
face more write-offs stemming from almost $10 billion of real
estate and other investments.
   Georgia-Pacific fell 1 5/8 to 37 1/8, and International
Paper dropped 1/4 to 53 5/8. The two paper companies were
named defendants in a $2 billion lawsuit filed in Mississippi
that alleges they dumped dioxin and other pollutants into
three state rivers.
   LL&amp;E Royalty Trust rose 1/4 to 2 3/4, after falling 1/4
point Thursday. Late Thursday, the trust said that it
currently hasn't any plans to reduce its monthly
distribution, clarifying an earlier statement that led some
investors to believe distributions might be eliminated.
   Georgia Gulf jumped 3/4 to 10 after adding 1 1/8 the
previous day. As reported Thursday, First Boston raised its
investment rating on the stock and boosted its earnings
estimates for the company. The stock may also be getting a
boost from an article in Forbes, which speculates that
Georgia Gulf could be the next takeover target among chemical
concerns.
   Timken fell 7/8 to 20 1/2, a new 52-week low. Timken's
chief financial officer, J. Kevin Ramsey, told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that there are indications that
"things are soft" and "business is definitely off" in 1990's
fourth quarter compared with the year's previous quarters.
