   BALTIMORE -- MNC Financial Inc., the struggling parent of
Maryland National Bank, suspended dividend payments on its
common shares and on its three issues of preferred stock.
   MNC, which has been increasingly hurt by problem
commercial real estate loans, had agreed in October that it
wouldn't pay any dividends without approval from the Federal
Reserve Board.

   By suspending the dividends, MNC will retain about $26
million a quarter in capital that it otherwise would have
paid out to shareholders. Most of those savings will come
from suspending the 29 cent-a-share quarterly dividend on its
84 million common shares outstanding.
   MNC also has a small issue of convertible preferred stock
and two issues of adjustable-rate preferred stock. Total
quarterly dividend payments on those shares would have been
about $1.8 million.
   MNC common shares closed at $3.375 each, unchanged Friday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The dividend
suspension was announced after the stock market closed.
   In a statement, MNC said its board would consider
restoring dividend payments "depending upon regulatory
approval and a variety of factors relating to the company's
performance, such as its financial condition, results of
operations, capital levels and other appropriate
information."
   MNC, which has assets of about $25 billion, is trying to
sell assets, including the nation's fourth largest bank
credit-card operation, to reduce debt and improve its capital
position. If MNC can't find a buyer for its credit-card
business, the company plans to attempt to spin off the unit
with an initial public offering valued at as much as $1.3
billion.
