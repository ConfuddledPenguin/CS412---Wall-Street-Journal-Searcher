   Governments aren't used to cutting back, so the reduction
in legislative staffing that was part of California's Prop.
140 term-limit initiative is terra incognita. The solons are
taking good care of the help scheduled to depart by July 1.
The state Senate Rules Committee has authorized five months'
severance pay for employees of two or more years, and three
months' lump sum for those who've worked for a year. Generous
indeed by private-sector standards, but we'd expect nothing
less.
