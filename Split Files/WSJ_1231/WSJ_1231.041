   CLEVELAND -- Charter One Financial Inc. said it expects to
report a net loss for the year following a one-time,
fourth-quarter charge of $28.2 million to write off the
bank's good will.
   Charter One said that excluding the charge, it expects to
report record earnings for the year. Last year's net was
$16.9 million, or $2.44 a share.

   Charter One said writing off the bank's good will is
expected to eliminate annual operating expenses by about $1.3
million after tax.
   Good will represents the difference between the purchase
price of an asset and its fair market value.
