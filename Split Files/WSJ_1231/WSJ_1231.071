   VINEYARD, Utah -- Geneva Steel, citing a general decline
in steel prices, reported net income for the first quarter
ended Nov. 30 fell 39% on 6% lower revenue.
   Net dropped to $7.1 million, or 47 cents a share, from
$11.8 million, or $1.01 a share, for the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue dipped to $124.3 million from $132.2
million. Tons shipped eased to 340,000 from 344,000 a year
ago.

   Increased operating, labor and freight costs as well as
unscheduled mill downtime in September hurt profit in the
quarter, Geneva Steel said.
   The company's $239 million modernization program, which
includes building two basic oxygen furnaces, a coilbox, a
continuous caster and other rolling-mill improvements, is
scheduled for completion by September 1992. The upgrades are
designed to reduce operating costs and increase the quality
of its finished products.
   Geneva makes hot-rolled sheet, plate and other steel
products for use primarily in central and western U.S.
markets.
   The company said the Linde division of Union Carbide
Corp.'s Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc. will build and
operate a $25 million oxygen plant to supply oxygen and other
needed gases to the new furnaces. It is scheduled for
completion in 1991's third quarter.
