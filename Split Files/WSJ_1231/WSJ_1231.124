   Flagship Financial Corp. said it added $4.7 million to
loan-loss reserves, resulting in losses for the quarter of
about $3 million, or 86 cents a share, and $13 million, or
$3.75 a share, for the year.
   The Jenkintown, Pa., thrift company, which owns First
American Savings and Brandywine Savings Bank, had net income
of $1.4 million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier
fourth quarter. For all of 1989, Flagship had net of $6.1
million, or $1.75 a share. The results included pretax gains
on the sales of loans and securities.

   The company said about $2 million of the addition to
reserves is related to a $6.4 million loan for the
construction of a commercial office building. Flagship
classified the loan as nonperforming as of June 30.
