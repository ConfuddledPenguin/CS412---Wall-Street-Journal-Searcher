   FMS FINANCIAL Corp. (Burlington, N.J.) -- Craig W. Yates,
a board member and major shareholder, was named president and
chief executive officer of FMS and Farmers and Mechanics'
Savings Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary. Mr. Yates, 49 years
old, succeeds Michael D. Bisceglia, 55, who will continue as
a member of the board of directors. The naming of Mr. Yates
is part of a reorganization at the savings bank, which
reported a loss of $1.06 million, or 82 cents a share for the
nine months ended Sept. 30. Mr. Yates, who holds a 9.9% stake
in the bank, stressed that Farmers and Mechanics continues to
meet all regulatory and capital requirements, despite a
"difficult year for real estate values in New Jersey."
