   PENNSAUKEN, N.J. -- Environmental Control Group Inc. said
its president and chief executive, Brian R. Esher, plans to
leave the company early next year and that it is looking for
a successor.
   Mr. Esher, 42 years old, joined the company in the fall of
1989 as chief executive, when the company was posting losses.
Last July, he assumed the additional duties of chairman,
succeeding John Stoddard, who had held the position since
early 1989.

   Environmental Control, a solid hazardous-waste control
concern and insurance company, had third-quarter net income
of $483,000, or seven cents a share, on revenue of $15.1
million.
   Environmental Control recently named its chief financial
officer, Anthony J. Gurley, to the post of chief operating
officer, with responsibility for daily planning and
administration of Environmental Control's subsidiaries.
   In 1989, Environmental Control posted a loss of $5.7
million, causing technical defaults under its bank lending
agreements. The technical defaults have been eliminated.
   "The company's balance sheet has been strengthened, and we
have had good relations with the banks," Mr. Esher said,
adding that bank debt has been reduced to less than $5
million, from nearly $16 million when he joined the company.
