   Great Lakes Bancorp said it expects to write off between
$25 million and $28 million in good will, which will result
in a loss of as much as $23 million in 1990.
   Great Lakes Bancorp said future earnings will benefit from
the write-off because the annual expense of amortizing good
will and other intangibles is reduced.

   The company also said it will add between $15 million and
$18 million to its reserves to protect it from possible loan
losses and improve future earnings. The increase will boost
reserves to between $23 million and $26 million.
