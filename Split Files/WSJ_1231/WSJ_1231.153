   MODERNIZING IRELAND

   Ireland's Prime Minister Charles Haughey said his ruling
Fianna Fail Party would embark on a 10-year strategy to
modernize Irish society.
   That plan calls for legalizing homosexuality and studying
the introduction of divorce. Homosexuality now is punishable
by life imprisonment under a rarely invoked 19th century law.
Divorce is banned.
   "It is our intention to carry out a comprehensive review
of current developments and to publish a white paper
following the review," the prime minister told party members.
   Mr. Haughey's announcement was seen as an attempt to give
his party a more progressive image after it lost the
presidential election last month to left-wing lawyer Mary
Robinson.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA'S WAGE GUIDELINES
                                                                                                       

   South Korea announced guidelines calling for wage
increases in 1991 to be held below 10%. The aim is to curb
inflation while improving the competitiveness of Korean
exports. South Korean wages have increased sharply since 1988
as labor unions have become stronger with the nation's
political democratization. Average wage increases nationwide
were 21.1% in 1989 and will be an estimated 17% in 1990. The
guidelines are legally nonbinding but are published in an
attempt to set the levels the government feels are necessary
for continued growth.
                                                                                                       

   DIVIDED OPINION IN ISRAEL
                                                                                                       

   Israelis are deeply divided on how to deal with the
three-year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories, according to an opinion poll. The sounding of
1,200 adult Israeli Jews was published in the Jerusalem
Report, a weekly news magazine. The poll said 25% favored
some sort of statehood for the 1.7 million Palestinians of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-one percent wanted to
expel all or some of the Palestinians from the occupied
territories, and 20% thought Israel should withdraw from the
Gaza Strip. Only 6% favored annexing the West Bank, 9% opted
for preserving the present situation and 19% had no opinion.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH AFRICAN HARDSHIP
                                                                                                       

   The South African Black Taxi Association, representing
thousands of owners and drivers of the vehicles used by most
black commuters in Johannesburg, said members' earnings have
dropped by about 50% this year. An association spokesman said
that soaring transportation costs, plus disruption of
services due to township violence and bloody "taxi wars"
among rival drivers contributed to the decline. The drivers'
average monthly earnings this year are the equivalent of
about $600.
                                                                                                       

   TOYOTA'S U.S. SALES PROJECTIONS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. expects sales in the U.S. to
increase next year, a spokesman said, but he denied a
Japanese newspaper report that the company had set a 1991
target of 1.07 million vehicles. Early this year Toyota
predicted U.S. sales in 1990 would total 1.03 million units,
but the spokesman said that has been revised upward to 1.05
million or 1.06 million. He said a target for 1991 would
likely be announced at automobile trade shows in Detroit in
January.
                                                                                                       

   CRISIS HURTS EUROPE'S AIRLINES
                                                                                                       

   Air traffic from Europe to the Middle East continued to be
badly affected by the Gulf crisis in October. The Association
of European Airlines said passenger traffic to the Middle
East and to North Africa both declined 25% from a year
earlier. Overall, the association said, passenger traffic
rose 4.8% from a year earlier, half the growth rate seen
during the summer months. The association said soaring fuel
costs had continued to hurt the industry, as had the general
slowdown in economic activity worldwide.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE RECYCLING INNOVATION
                                                                                                       

   A Japanese maker of food containers said it has developed
a technology to recycle plastic-foam containers into fuel.
   A spokesman for the company, Chuo Kagaku Co., said it
hopes to market a device by February 1991 that will condense
plastic foam on site at shops and restaurants. Chuo Kagaku
will pick up the condensed plastic and process it into fuel
for industrial boilers. Each device would be priced at about
$757,000, he said.
   The device uses vegetable oil to heat and melt plastics
made from thermoplastic resin. It can process about 22 cubic
feet of plastic an hour, reducing it to about one 50th of its
original size, the spokesman said.
   Chuo Kagaku will collect the reduced plastic and process
it into powder, which can be used as fuel for boilers in
industrial plants. In the process, the company will remove
substances that emit poisonous gases when burned.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Canada's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 9.1% in
November, the highest level in more than three years, the
government's statistical agency reported. The October figure
was 8.8%. . . . Italian stockbrokers voted to suspend a
protest strike scheduled for Dec. 13 in light of the initial
approval of a long-awaited piece of market-modernizing
legislation. The brokers' union stressed that the strike call
has only been suspended, rather than revoked, although no new
strike date was announced.

   CHUO KAGAKU Co., a Japanese maker of food containers, said
it will sell a device, priced at the equivalent of $7,570, to
condense used plastic-foam containers at shops and
restaurants so they can be recycled as fuel for industrial
boilers. The price of the device was misstated in the Dec. 10
edition.
