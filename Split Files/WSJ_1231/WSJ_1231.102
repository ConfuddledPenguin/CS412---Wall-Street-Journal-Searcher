   HARRISBURG, Pa. -- State regulators here knew Life
Assurance Co. of Pennsylvania was in trouble. But they hoped
the problems would go away.
   Lacop, as it is known, had for years appeared on a
national watch list of shaky insurers. Various states had
barred it from doing business within their borders. But it
was up to Pennsylvania, Lacop's home state, to decide whether
to shut it down. And Pennsylvania waited.
   Lacop assured state officials this past July that it soon
planned to sell its policies to another insurer and get out
of the business. Officials decided to give Lacop more time
even though its bank accounts were overdrawn by $2.8 million.
Lacop wrote millions of dollars in new policies as the state
held back.
   This fall, Lacop gradually stopped paying most claims.
First a trickle and then a torrent of calls came into the
insurance department from angry policyholders and banks
complaining about missed payments and bounced checks. In late
October, the state suspended all operations at Lacop, and
regulators are now seeking to have the company declared
insolvent by a state court.
   State insurance Commissioner Constance Foster, an
energetic official who has built up a department that had
declined for years, says she remains astounded by Lacop's
demise. "I'll tell you frankly, to this day I don't know how
this company became insolvent." The company disputes the
notion that it is actually insolvent, and says it plans to
challenge the state in court.
   The Lacop case illustrates several problems with the way
insurance companies are regulated in this country. Though it
reaches not only across state lines but around the globe,
insurance is governed by a patchwork of local regulation that
is sustained by state and industry lobbying. So diffuse is
the current system that state regulators refer to companies
headquartered in other states as "foreign."
   There is increasing concern that the business is
outstripping the ability of laws, regulators, and accounting
rules to guide it. The business itself is riskier than ever.
Property and casualty carriers, who once concentrated on the
more predictable hazards of theft and fire, now also
underwrite far riskier lines such as product liability and
financial guaranties. Life insurers, acting much like banks,
are selling investments at narrowing profits backed in some
cases by worrisome assets. And hundreds of policy writers use
offshore companies to "reinsure" their own risks.
   Up against this are state insurance departments, whose
abilities and resources vary widely. While New York spent
more than $50 million to monitor the $31 billion in policies
written there last year, Pennsylvania spent only $11 million
to regulate the $27 billion of policies written in that
state. New York's insurance commission has 821 staffers,
while Pennsylvania's has but 263. Pennsylvania has only seven
financial analysts and 46 field examiners to inspect the
roughly 400 insurance companies headquartered there and the
more than 1,000 other companies doing business in the state.
The small staff conducted about 200 examinations this year.
   "I guess that you can always use more {resources}, but I
feel that we have been very kindly treated" by the state
budget, Commissioner Foster says.
   While no one has questioned the integrity or the
commitment of Pennsylvania's department, that isn't so in
some other states. Two commissioners were indicted earlier
this year for alleged bribe-taking in unrelated incidents.
Critics say many states still jockey for narrow and parochial
interests at the expense of a coordinated, national approach
to policing insurers. And more than a century of close
connections between the industry and its government overseers
persists, even though for years many regulators themselves
have called for greater regulatory independence.
   "The problem with state regulation is that in many cases
it continues to function in the era of the quill pen,"
complains Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat whose
Oversight and Investigations subcommittee has been
researching the insurance business for over a year. Many in
the industry believe Rep. Dingell will next year propose
federal legislation for insurance regulation.
   Proponents argue that the current regulatory structure can
catch up with the modern realities of insurance. The system
is slowly strengthening its oversight of companies' financial
conditions. "We have accomplished more in the last year on
solvency regulation than we have in the last 20 years
combined," says James Long, North Carolina insurance
commissioner and president of the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners, which coordinates state regulation.
   But, for all their efforts, the states still have far to
go. When an insurer falls ill, its home state is expected by
other states to monitor -- and, if need be, cut off -- the
business. Theoretically, consumers across the country are
equally protected. In practice, 50 doctors may minister to
the one patient, enforcing different laws with widely varying
vigilance. The Pennsylvania department is a case in point.
   The agency was in disarray when Mrs. Foster took over in
January 1987, inside and outside observers contend. Eight
commissioners had come and gone in as many years. Staffing
had dropped by about 30% in the preceding decade. And a major
insolvency was breaking on the scene.
   Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Insurance Co. had recently
failed and been taken over by the department. Its assets
trailed its liabilities by about $400 million, making it the
largest insurance failure in Pennsylvania history. Mrs.
Foster had little experience in this kind of thing herself,
having spent most of her time as a Philadelphia attorney
suing insurance companies in workers' compensation cases.
Still, she says, it was immediately apparent that the
department wasn't up to its regulatory responsibilities.
   "It was clear that our solvency net was full of holes,"
she says. Among other things, she was bothered by the sight
of department financial analysts checking company numbers
with hand calculators. There was hardly a computer in sight.
   Commissioner Foster has pushed staff training and shaken
up the organization chart. She has increased the staff by 33%
and the budget by 43%. And she draws praise from some other
commissioners. "Connie seems to be able to filter through all
the technical stuff and understand what's needed for the
marketplace," says Elaine McReynolds, Tennessee's insurance
commissioner.
   For her part, Mrs. Foster says, "I think we have used
every financial and human resource to our fullest potential
in the last four years. We couldn't have done more. But I do
think there are more improvements we can make."
   Penny-pinching remains a way of life in the department.
The commissioner recently spent days debating the purchase of
a $25,000 machine to improve the flow of calls to the
complaints department.
   Pennsylvania's insurance outlays are proportionately among
the lowest of major states. Moreover, the department
routinely takes in more in license fees and fines than it
spends -- resulting in a "profit" to the state of $4 million
in the latest fiscal year. And, like all states, Pennsylvania
also collects taxes on insurance premiums that dwarf
regulatory spending. Those amounted to about $190 million in
the last fiscal year, ended June 30.
   Most of Commissioner Foster's improvements and added
personnel have been in politically attractive areas such as
rate monitoring and consumer complaint services.
   Insurance regulation is more than financial analysis. In a
nondescript brick high-rise a few blocks down from the
capital building in Harrisburg, rows of employees field calls
from distressed consumers while dozens of actuaries and rate
specialists scrutinize over 14,000 rate filings and over
40,000 policy forms a year.
   Under Gov. Robert Casey, the Democrat who appointed
Commissioner Foster, Pennsylvania has undertaken some major
consumer-oriented initiatives, particularly in automobile
insurance, where it has compelled insurers to disregard a
policyholder's sex in setting rates and to reduce rates in
return for some restructuring of certain mandatory coverage.
   As the Lacop case shows, attention to company analysis and
solvency was almost lost in the battles over auto rates and
other issues.
   About every three or four years, regulators visit
insurance companies in Pennsylvania and around the country to
do an on-site audit of the books. It's a time consuming
process that takes months and even years to complete. And
critics contend that these so-called examinations are often
so late as to be useless. The state's examination of Lacop
for the year 1987, for example, still isn't finished.
   Insurers do have to voluntarily report a raft of financial
data to the state every year, and that data is fed into a
computer run by the national insurance commissioners' group.
In fact, as the insurance business becomes more complex,
regulators are relying more on computers than increased
manpower to monitor insurers's health.
   Each year, the computer identifies companies that may be
in financial trouble so that states, and particularly their
home state, can pay closer attention. Beginning in the
mid-1980s, the computer picked out Lacop as a troubled
insurer.
   Life Assurance Co. of Pennsylvania is a 33-year-old,
closely-held company that is part of the real estate and
insurance holdings of Chicago businessman Richard Fanslow.
Lacop specialized in so-called credit life policies, which
promised to keep up payments on car and consumer loans even
if the borrower should die or be disabled. A small company,
it had total capital of but $7.8 million as of June 30. The
nation's largest life insurer, Prudential Life Insurance Co.
of America, has more than $5 billion in capital.
   James Blair, president of Lacop, declines to discuss its
dealings with regulators, saying it is contesting a number of
insurance department actions in court.
   The first regulatory action against Lacop came more than a
year ago, when Ohio's insurance department limited the
premiums Lacop could write there. In October 1989, the
Illinois department banned the company altogether. So did
Tennessee in December of that year. And last April,
California took the same step, alleging that the company was
"conducting its business and affairs in a manner hazardous to
its policyholders, creditors, and the public." Maryland
lifted the company's license in July.
   Yet, most states held to tradition, counting on Lacop's
home regulators in Pennsylvania to take the lead. West
Virginia, one of Lacop's most active markets, awaited action
from Pennsylvania while the company took in $11.4 million
from West Virginia residents in the year and a half leading
to June 30. "We rely on the regulatory strength and ability
of the insurance company's home state; that's all we can do,"
says John Collins, director of the West Virginia insurance
department's Financial Conditions Division. He notes that he
and two financial analysts must look after the 1,200
companies licensed to do business in the state.
   By June 30, Lacop's bank accounts were overdrawn by $2.8
million. Assets exceeded liabilities only because another of
Mr. Fanslow's businesses transferred the deed on an $8.5
million piece of property to Lacop.
   Yet Pennsylvania refused to take action -- in part,
regulators say, because they were misled by company
officials, and in part because they say shutting an insurer
down is such a drastic and difficult step.
   By summer, state and Lacop officials were in almost daily
contact. State officials failed to appreciate the seriousness
of the company's cash shortage. Moreover, they were focused
on Lacop's assurances in July that it was getting out of the
insurance business altogether. "I remember breathing a sigh
of relief when they told us that and thinking that we
wouldn't have to take harsher action," recalls Kenneth
Wolensky, the 28-year-old director of the department's Bureau
of Licensing and Financial Analysis.
   Harsher action means taking an insurer to court and
proving -- generally against the company's protests -- that
it is insolvent, or that its liabilities exceed its assets.
Commissioner Foster says the cases can be tough to prove. And
when the state wins, it then has the burdensome job of taking
control of the insurer and liquidating it.
   "We thought that we could dismember the company, and that
there were books of business within Lacop that were very
attractive, and that those books of business could be sold
off with no impact at all on the consumers," Commissioner
Foster says. "Once you put a book of life insurance into
liquidation, there are some very big legal questions about
what's going to happen to the holders of whole life
{policies}, and that was something we were trying to avoid."
   It seemed at first that there might be buyers for Lacop's
business. Negotiations with an undisclosed party droned on
through August and into September, and the department kept
its hopes up.
   But then, in about mid-September, calls began trickling
into the state that Lacop claims weren't being paid and then
that claim checks were bouncing. The department paid little
attention. Lacop, according to state officials, explained
complaints away, first as a processing problem and then as a
temporary cash glitch that would soon be covered by a line of
credit.
   "We were misled," the commissioner says now.
   On October 4, Lacop voluntarily stopped writing new
business, again quelling state concerns. Not until mid-month
did the state realize the full gravity of the cash problem.
On Oct. 18 it issued an order officially suspending the
company's business, and four days later it sent an examiner
into the company's offices. But it was too late. Ronald
Chronister, deputy insurance commissioner for company
regulation, says the state had for months planned to send a
team of examiners into Lacop, but somehow "other priorities
just interceded."
   In Pennsylvania's mind, Lacop's days of independent
operation were over. Nearly half a decade after the first
warnings signs from regulators' computers, Commissioner
Foster, on Nov. 23, asked the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania in Harrisburg to declare Lacop insolvent. Lacop
is disputing that assertion, but it declines to disclose its
reasons. A court hearing is scheduled for early January.
   Across the country, the number of insolvencies has jumped
to a record 44 last year from less than five per year earlier
in the decade, renewing calls for some form of federal
oversight of insurance.
   State oversight of the insurance industry dates back to
1868, when the U.S. Supreme Court concluded in a case called
Paul vs. Virginia that insurance wasn't a form of commerce
and therefore was exempt from federal control. "A historical
quirk," one scholar has called the ruling. The high court
overturned Paul vs. Virginia in 1944. But the industry and
its state government allies, in a lobbying tour de force,
swiftly convinced Congress to pass the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson
Act, once again exempting insurance from federal control,
including antitrust laws. The act "violates the most
fundamental rights of citizens and economic good sense," says
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who has conducted a
number of campaigns to rescind McCarran-Ferguson.
   While the industry and the individual states have beaten
back such attempts before, both groups feel under pressure
now. In response, the state commissioners' group, NAIC, is
working to get the 50 states to adopt uniform standards of
regulation, such as requiring that all insurers get an
outside auditor to sign off on their annual statement of
financial health. Currently, only 15 states, including
Pennsylvania, require such an audit.
   The NAIC this year began a campaign to certify state
insurance departments. Two of the best state departments, New
York and Florida, entered the process. Both were certified,
but NAIC officials concede that many states would flunk if
tested. Nor has the NAIC adopted any punishment for failure
to attain certification, asserting instead that insurance
buyers themselves will shun companies based in states that
don't make the grade.
   State politics in many cases can play as big a role as
theories of insurance regulation and sound accounting
practices. California Assemblyman Patrick Johnston says he
ran into a buzz saw this summer when he proposed limiting
insurance company junk-bond holdings to 20% of assets. Mr.
Johnston, who is chairman of the assembly's Finance and
Insurance Committee, says he hadn't reckoned on the lobbying
powers of Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp., a major
holder of junk bonds. His bill was sunk by his own committee.
"It wasn't even close," he says. First Executive has declined
to comment on the assembly vote.
   The regulatory process itself is infused with industry
officials and lobbyists at all levels. NAIC meetings often
are filled with insurance executives, known sometimes as "the
greenies" because of the registration tags they must wear. At
a conference in Baltimore earlier this year, industry
representatives outnumbered state officials more than six to
one. Each NAIC committee has an industry advisory group,
whose members sit side by side with their regulators,
cajoling and arguing about the detailed rules and
requirements that are supposed to guide the industry.
   At their worst, industry ties to regulators have led to
allegations of corruption. According to federal prosecutors,
Louisiana insurance Commissioner Douglas Green let
now-insolvent Champion Insurance Co. stay in business,
despite widespread complaints that the insurer wasn't paying
claims, after he had received $150,000 in campaign
contributions from interests related to the company.
   This June, a federal grand jury in New Orleans charged Mr.
Green with mail fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. He
was also indicted in Baton Rouge in July by a state grand
jury on charges of public bribery in the same matter. Through
a spokeswoman, Mr. Green denies the charges, which he says
are politically motivated.
   Former Wyoming insurance Commissioner Gordon W. Taylor Jr.
was indicted earlier this year on three federal counts of
alleged bribe-taking in connection with companies under his
department's surveillance. Mr. Taylor recently pleaded guilty
in federal court in Casper, Wyo., to one of the charges and
is awaiting sentencing.
   Meanwhile in Pennsylvania, lessons are being learned,
Commissioner Foster says. "Next time we will be less
accepting of what the company has to say," she asserts. The
state has been working for two years on a new computer system
of its own to better target troubled insurers. It plans to
cut back on its on-site examinations of clearly healthy
companies to concentrate more resources on sick ones.
   Many of the more aggressive state insurance commissions
are taking similar steps. But other states lag far behind.
Commissioner Foster says she reluctantly would welcome
federal guidelines for states to follow. "I think there is a
crying need for minimum standards," she says. Better
monitoring of company "solvency is the door through which
federal regulation will walk. Some form of it is inevitable."
