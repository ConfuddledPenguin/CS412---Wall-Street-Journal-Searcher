   OTTAWA -- The cabinet of Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney upheld a ruling ordering Canada's cable television
industry to pay more than 50 million Canadian dollars
(US$43.1 million) annually in copyright fees to compensate
U.S. movie producers and other copyright holders for the use
of their programs.
   The Canadian Copyright Board, a regulatory agency, ruled
in October that cable companies must pay copyright fees on
programs they retransmit from abroad. The board's ruling
implemented a Canadian commitment in the U.S.-Canada free
trade agreement. The Canadian Cable Television Association,
an industry group, had appealed the board's decision to the
federal cabinet.

   Canada's Consumer and Corporate Affairs Minister Pierre
Blais said the cabinet "was satisfied that the board followed
the process established by law." He said the government will
issue new criteria for setting royalty fees in the future.
   The cable television association is expected to appeal the
cabinet's decision to the Federal Court of Canada.
   The fees are retroactive to January 1990. The Copyright
Board is scheduled to begin another review of retransmission
payments in July to set fees for 1992.
   About 57% of the total royalty payment will go to a group
representing producers of U.S. movies and syndicated
programs.
