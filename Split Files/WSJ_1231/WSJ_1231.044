   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Premier Ante Markovic said the
dinar would be devalued by 22.2% against the German mark
under reform plans announced Friday to both chambers of the
federal Parliament.
   The government appealed to Parliament to accept planned
economic reforms, warning that 1991 is "crucial" for the
survival of the fractious federation.

   Mr. Markovic told deputies that, beginning Tuesday, the
dinar would be pegged to the mark at a rate of nine dinars to
one mark. The previous rate was seven dinars to one mark.
   The premier also called for a wage freeze to help keep
inflation down and for ceilings on public spending by the
federation and Yugoslavia's six republics.
