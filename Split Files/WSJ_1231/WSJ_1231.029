   When Col. Antoine Lecerf of the French Foreign Legion
(page one, Nov. 13) says a woman would never don the famous
"kepi blanc" of a legionnaire, he is probably too late. If
P.C. Wren (author of "Beau Geste") is to be believed, one
did.
   Wren's book "The Wages of Virtue" contains an incident
involving a woman who served in the French Foreign Legion.
Criticized that this was absurd, Wren offered to accompany
the critic to North Africa and show him the tombstone, with
its official epitaph, of the female legionnaire. She was a
European woman who served for many years in the spahis, as a
cavalry trooper, and rose to the rank of sergeant. Only after
she died in battle was it discovered she was a woman.
