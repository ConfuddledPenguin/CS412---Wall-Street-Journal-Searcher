   BEIJING -- China's leaders approved a vague Five-Year Plan
that offers few changes or surprises but gives them a good
deal of leeway to manage the economy.
   The plan was announced yesterday after a six-day Communist
Party plenum in Beijing involving 584 senior party members.
The main thrust of the 1991-95 guidelines is to retain
current economic reforms while looking for ways to keep most
economic activity under government control. But the plan also
will hold in reserve some more-radical reform tools for use
should emergencies arise.

   The economic blueprint reflects Beijing's continued
concern with maintaining stability in a country undermined by
widespread unemployment, growing income disparities and a
draining dependence on state subsidies. Moreover, Beijing
hardliners have encountered strong resistance to a full-scale
economic retrenchment in several pre-plenum meetings.
   While conservative leaders might have wanted to turn the
clock back on economic reform or find ways to reconcile
Marxism with a market economy, the instinct for
self-preservation has won out.
   A statement after the plenum said China's future depended
on the "universal truth of Marxism." But it also said reforms
in "prices, finance, taxation, banking, planning, investment
and labor and wages . . . should center around the goal of
establishing a new economic system."
   The details of the documents that party leaders approved,
including a 10-year blueprint for longer-term goals similar
to those of the Five-Year Plan, weren't publicized. Some
information will be made public when China's rubber-stamp
parliament, the National People's Congress, approves the plan
in March. The Five-Year Plan isn't as crucial to China's
economy as it used to be. After a decade of reform, much of
China's economy operates outside the plan, and its chief
function is to allocate credit and approve major construction
projects -- not allot materials and set output levels, as it
once did.
   Based on bits of information that trickle through, China
seems headed for much of the same. Foreign investment will be
welcomed, but the government will continue to be more
selective. Top priorities are needed technology and factories
making products currently imported.
   In a widely expected change, the central government's
construction money, as well as infrastructure loans provided
by foreign countries and world development organizations,
will be aimed at central China -- the provinces bordering the
Yangtze River and its gateway, Shanghai. The idea is to bring
prosperity from the coast into China's heartland and ease
income disparities. The 1985-90 plan emphasized southern
China and five special economic zones, and their prosperity
has far outpaced the rest of the country.
   The most troublesome issues, which sparked fierce debate
and delayed the party plenum for several months, remain
mostly unresolved. The provinces and the central government
haven't agreed on a new tax structure. Currently, all taxes
are collected by local officials, and payments are fixed
amounts set by contract. Thus, tax revenues don't rise as the
economy grows and most of the money is siphoned off before it
reaches Beijing, which faces a $14 billion budget deficit
this year.
   It also appears that no innovative methods were devised
for ending China's addiction to subsidies to citizens in the
form of cheap rent, food and transportation and to
state-owned corporations to keep them afloat.
   The party has set the vague goal of reducing price
subsidies over time if opportune circumstances arise. Since
they ordered troops to fire on demonstrators in Beijing in
June 1989, China's leaders have been consumed by fears of
instability -- so no radical price reforms are planned.
