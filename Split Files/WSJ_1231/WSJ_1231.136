   TWO LAWMAKERS FAULTED Bush for rejecting Iraq's Jan. 12
date for talks.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and Rep. Les Aspin,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the
president and Baghdad's Saddam Hussein must break the
stalemate over diplomatic talks. Dole, asserting that
Americans "are not yet committed to war," said he has
received indications from Iraq that Baghdad may show
flexibility on dates for the talks. Meanwhile, a U.S.
official said he believes EC foreign ministers will reaffirm
support for a Jan. 15 deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait when they meet Friday.

   Soviet police with bulldozers razed Moscow's
five-month-old "Tent City," a group of plastic and cardboard

that 52 makeshift dwellings were destroyed.
                                                                                                       

   Moldavia agreed to comply with a Kremlin order to
reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official
language. The republic's parliament acted in response to a
decree issued by Gorbachev, who has sought to defuse ethnic
