   WASHINGTON -- Resolution Trust Corp., the U.S.
thrift-cleanup agency, sold Enterprise Savings Bank, Chicago,
as it continued its effort to sell shaky institutions rather
than let a government takeover of them reduce their market
value.
   Enterprise Savings, with $447.8 million in assets, was
acquired by United Federal Bank, a unit of Westinghouse
Federal Bank, Galesburg, Ill. The thrift agency expects the
government's cost of the transaction to be $55 million in
funds that will be advanced to United Federal to compensate
for the bad assets held by Enterprise. Under the terms of the
sale, United Federal will obtain virtually all of the failed
institution's assets, as well as its deposits.

   Enterprise Federal was closed briefly Thursday and its
shareholders' interests were wiped out. It reopened as part
of United Federal Friday.
   The agency believes that it gets higher prices for
institutions by selling them before they have been operated
by the RTC for a long period of time. Three other thrifts
have been sold using this approach.
