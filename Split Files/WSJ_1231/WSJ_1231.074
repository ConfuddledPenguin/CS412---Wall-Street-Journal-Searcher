   MIAMI -- FDP Corp. expects to report fourth-quarter net
income of about $193,000, or six cents a share, compared with
a year-earlier net loss of $53,835, or two cents a share,
said Michael C. Goldberg, president and chief executive
officer.
   The company, which makes and markets software systems for
the pension and life-insurance industries, said revenue in
the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 22% to about $4.5
million from $3.7 million.

   "Now we're starting to see the results of development that
we were putting into place over the last few years," Mr.
Goldberg said, adding that he expects the trend of higher
revenue and earnings to continue through 1991.
   Mr. Goldberg said the company's profit margin widened to
20% from 9% a year earlier. He said selling, general and
administrative expenses held steady at about $785,000 in the
quarter.
   For all of fiscal 1990, FDP expects to report earnings of
about $483,000, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of $16.9
million, compared with 1989 loss of $100,000, or three cents
a share, on revenue of $14.6 million.
