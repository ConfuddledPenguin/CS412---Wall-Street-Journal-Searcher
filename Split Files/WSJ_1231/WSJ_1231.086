   SHAWNEE, Okla. -- Barton Industries Inc. said it has
retained special counsel to conduct an investigation of
"certain financial and accounting matters" and placed three
of its top officers on administrative leave until the probe
is completed.
   The maker of oil-field equipment said its chairman and
chief executive officer, C.W. Earl Johnson, had requested an
administrative leave, which was granted by the board. The
board also placed the company's chief financial officer and
its controller on leave. The company said that Mark H.
McKinsey was elected president, chief operating officer and a
director.

   The company also said it was named a defendant in a
shareholder class-action suit filed in an Oklahoma federal
court alleging violations of federal securities law. Company
officials couldn't be reached for further information.
   The company didn't provide any details about the matters
under investigation. But earlier this month, the company
announced that it would restate the results for its fiscal
third quarter ended June 30 because a sale it booked was
returned during the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the company
said that because a supplier was slow to deliver the proper
parts for its control units, inventory had stacked up,
resulting in "substantial" reductions in fourth-quarter
earnings and revenue. The company said the problem could
contribute to a loss for the fiscal year and had caused it to
experience serious cash-flow problems. In that announcement,
the company also said it is delinquent on payments of
employee withholding taxes and has been working with the
Internal Revenue Service to resolve the problem.
   The next day, however, the company issued another
statement saying that the previous release, issued by its law
firm, was incorrect and unauthorized by management and the
board. The company said the board formed a special committee
to review certain matters pertaining to the law firm's
actions.
   In its "clarification," Mr. Johnson stated, among other
things, that the company expected to report a "good operating
profit for 1990, although corporate non-cash charges
unrelated to operations will reduced the operated results."
Further, he said, "the reported 1990 results will show
considerable improvement from the prior 1989 levels, and the
operating comparison will be even stronger."
   In its latest announcement, Barton said it has requested
that the deadline for filing of its annual 10k report for the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30 be extended. The company said it
isn't in a position to make any statement with respect to its
earnings, revenue, results of operations or other financial
information for the fiscal year.
