   WASHINGTON -- The Soviet Union finally is taking America's
advice about how to deal with the Middle East and, as a
result, could increase its influence there greatly when the
Persian Gulf crisis ends.
   After decades of fruitlessly supporting radicals in the
region, Moscow is strengthening its ties with the moderate
Arab states that are its partners in the U.S.-led coalition
against Iraq. The Soviets also are on the verge of resuming
full diplomatic relations with Israel. Following that,
Moscow, with the Bush administration's blessing, will push
for a regional meeting hosted by it and Washington.
Initially, the meeting would discuss arms-control issues, but
it ultimately could become the forum for overall Arab-Israeli
peace talks.

   "The Soviets are demonstrating what the U.S. has been
telling them all along: You can have good relations with the
Arabs and with Israel," said Martin Indyk, executive director
of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "It isn't a
zero-sum game."
   Barring complete upheaval in the Soviet Union, U.S.
analysts believe, the potential gains from the current policy
will persuade the Kremlin to keep pursuing this policy even
though its principal architect, Eduard Shevardnadze, has
resigned as Soviet foreign minister.
   The Bush administration, for its part, isn't worried any
longer that expanded Soviet influence in the region will come
at Washington's expense. The U.S. is convinced that Moscow
now is truly interested in promoting Mideast stability. And
the administration, angered by Israel's reluctance to pursue
peace talks, is ready to try a new approach in the region.
   The key to the change is Moscow's realization that
resuming full ties with Israel won't alienate most Arab
leaders. This year, the Soviets upgraded consular-level
activities involving Israel and permitted nearly 200,000
Soviet Jews to go to Israel, yet there were few protests from
Arab states. Indeed, Saudi Arabia, building on increasingly
friendly ties to the Soviets, for the first time established
diplomatic relations with Moscow. The Saudis also are talking
about extending a $4 billion line of credit to the Soviets.
   Even the Palestine Liberation Organization privately has
urged Moscow to resume ties with Israel, according to
Viacheslav Matouzov, a Mideast specialist at the Soviet
Embassy. The PLO believes that would put Moscow in a better
position to persuade Israel to negotiate with Palestinians,
he said.
   One reason for Moscow's interest in the new approach is
that it would allow it to continue playing the role of a
world power in a region where it has vital interests, even as
it withdraws from much of the rest of the world to
concentrate on domestic problems.
   Moscow inched closer to resuming relations with Israel,
which were severed after the 1967 Six Day War, during Mr.
Shevardnadze's recent Washington meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Following the session, Mr.
Shevardnadze said there no longer are any prerequisites for
resuming full ties. Previously, Moscow had insisted as a
condition that Israel attend a United Nations-sponsored peace
conference, a demand Israel rejects.
   Such an international conference still is discussed
heatedly at the U.N., but the idea's time appears to have
passed. This month, the Soviets, working quietly, helped the
U.S. keep a call for an international conference out of the
text of a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel
for violence against Palestinians.
   Moscow's idea to hold a regional arms-control meeting
under the auspices of the two major world powers has the
private support of Israel and most Arab states. Such a
meeting offers Mr. Shamir the chance to hold direct
negotiations with his Arab neighbors; Syria also has signaled
that a conference held under a major-power umbrella might be
acceptable. And Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia probably could
be persuaded to attend.
   According to Mideast diplomats, the Soviets propose trying
first to limit conventional arms sales and the proliferation
of missiles and missile technology. Moscow, borrowing from
measures used successfully to ease confrontation in Europe,
also wants to establish a regional center to reduce tensions.
The center would provide a forum for increasing
communications among Mideast nations and giving prior
notification of military maneuvers.
   The hope is that progress in those areas could lead to
talks between Israel and its Arab adversaries, particularly
Syria, on broader issues. "The Gulf crisis has provided the
example of close cooperation between the United States and
the Soviet Union," says Mr. Matouzov, the Soviet official.
When the crisis is resolved, he adds, such cooperation could
help settle other Mideast disputes.
