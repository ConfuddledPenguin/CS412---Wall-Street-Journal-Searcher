   HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's trade surplus in November plunged
to 491 million Hong Kong dollars (US$62.9 million) from
HK$3.11 billion a year earlier, as a sharp rise in re-exports
-- goods imported and reshipped without material change --
was overwhelmed by surging imports.
   The surplus also represented a narrowing from October's
HK$816 million.

   Domestic exports grew 13% to HK$21.88 billion from
HK$19.41 billion a year earlier, but were off 1.4% from
HK$22.19 billion in October. Re-exports surged 42% to
HK$42.71 billion from HK$30.05 billion in November 1989 and
were up 2.1% from October's HK$41.84 billion.
   Total exports rose 31% to HK$64.58 billion from the
year-earlier HK$49.46 billion and were up 1% from HK$64.024
billion in October. Imports climbed 38% to HK$64.09 billion
from HK$46.34 billion a year earlier and rose 1.4% from
HK$63.21 billion in October.
   The colony's trade account in the first 11 months swung to
a deficit of HK$268 million from a surplus of HK$5.67 billion
a year earlier.
