   The California Public Utilities Commission approved
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s plan to expand a 900-mile
natural gas pipeline from British Columbia in Canada to
California.
   The $1.2 billion project still requires approval by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has indicated it
will make a decision shortly. The California regulatory
approval covers only the 415 miles of pipeline within the
state, and not the parts through Idaho, Washington and
Oregon. The California commission's approval is conditioned
on the San Francisco-based company's complying with
environmental mitigation measures. It said it "made it clear
that it was up to PG&amp;E, not the commission, to assess the
market demand for gas transportation to determine whether it
should undertake the expansion project." Construction is to
begin in early 1992; completion is expected by late 1993.

   The expanded pipeline will transport an additional 755
million cubic feet a day of Canadian natural gas to
California and 148 million cubic feet to the Pacific
Northwest.
