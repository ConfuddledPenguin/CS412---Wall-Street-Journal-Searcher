   Your Nov. 19 page-one article about drugs and public
opinion revealed the persistence of the drug crisis but
understated Americans' resolve to confront the problem.
   You described a "falloff in public concern about drugs"
and cited evidence from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. But
you should be careful in references to opinion polls. When
someone is surveyed, they are usually asked two kinds of
questions. One is open-ended, asking the respondent to list
what he or she thinks are the most critical issues facing the
nation. The other kind of question is more structured, asking
respondents to rate a list of issues on a scale, for example,
from "unimportant" to "crucial." Answers to the open-ended
questions can change week to week, depending on current
events. Answers to the rating-type questions provide a more
accurate picture of people's long-term concerns.

   According to Gordon Black, the pollster your reporter
interviewed, people's responses to the structured questions
about drugs "haven't changed at all." Americans consistently
rate drugs as a crucial issue that will require long-term
attention by government. However, if someone were asked today
to state the most important issue facing the nation, he most
likely would say the Persian Gulf crisis or the impending
recession. In other words, the drug crisis is no less
important to Americans that it was a year ago. There simply
are a greater number of critical issues today.
   I agree that as crises recede from the middle class, they
often become "ghettoized," as you call it, and fall from
public view. As acceptance and casual use of drugs decrease,
we run the risk of complacency with the current state of
anti-drug efforts. But the drop-off in drug acceptance has
not just occurred among the white middle class. Mr. Black
maintains that African-Americans and Hispanics have changed
their attitudes as much, if not more, than white Americans.
The drug crisis hinges on the ever-increasing number of
hard-core addicts of all classes and races.
   Drugs directly affect a number of issues, such as crime,
AIDS and health care, that Americans rank high in importance.
References to opinion polls often do not show the
interrelatedness of these topics and therefore fail to reveal
the extent of people's concern.
