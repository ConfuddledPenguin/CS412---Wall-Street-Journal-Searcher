   Los Angeles investors David T. Smith and his wife, Norma,
said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they
hold a 5.7% stake in the Series G cumulative preferred stock
of First Executive Corp., a Los Angeles-based insurance
holding company.

7.6% of First Executive's depositary preference shares.

   In their latest filing, the Smiths said they hold 588,800
Series G shares, including 508,900 purchased from Oct. 31 to
Dec. 20 for 43 to 84 cents each. They also sold 191,200
shares from Nov. 21 to last Thursday for 58 to 92 cents each.
   The Smiths said in their filings that they believe the
shares are an attractive investment. First Executive, which
has been experiencing financial difficulties, didn't have any
comment on the Smiths' latest filing.
