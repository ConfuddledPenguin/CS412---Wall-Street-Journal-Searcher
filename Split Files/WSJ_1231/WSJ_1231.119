   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it transferred its 51%
stake in IBP Inc. to a holding company called Occidental
Agribusiness Investments Inc.
   A spokesman declined to comment on whether Occidental
transferred the 24 million IBP shares in preparation for a
sale of its stake in the giant Dakota City, Neb., beef and
pork packer.

   Since Occidental's patriarch, Armand Hammer, died earlier
this month, analysts have been speculating that the new
regime, led by Ray R. Irani, will dispose of several sacred
cows acquired under Dr. Hammer's reign -- chief among them
IBP, where the operations contrast oddly with the Los Angeles
company's primary interests in petroleum and chemicals.
   In a statement, Occidental said the transfer of shares to
Occidental Agribusiness from Occidental Petroleum Investment
Co. "conforms the corporate structure of Occidental's
interest in IBP to that of other operating divisions of
Occidental and does not represent any change in the
ownership."
