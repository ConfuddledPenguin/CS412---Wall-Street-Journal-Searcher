   TOKYO -- Japan's Fair Trade Commission said it admonished
12 major cement makers for agreeing to fix prices and
restrict sales in two regions of Japan.
   The companies have until Jan. 11 to challenge the
commission's ruling. If there is no challenge, the commission
would calculate a fine based on the amount of sales conducted
under the alleged cartel agreements, which stretch as far
back as 1985 and covered the northern island of Hokkaido and
southwestern Honshu. A commission spokesman declined to
estimate the amount of the sales.

   Japan has been under pressure from the U.S. to increase
fines and toughen enforcement of its antitrust laws. U.S. and
other foreign authorities have argued that collusive behavior
enables some Japanese companies to use their home market as a
safe haven while competing aggressively for market share
abroad.
   An advisory commission to Japan's Fair Trade Commission
this month recommended higher fines and stronger antitrust
enforcement. The issue is expected to be discussed with U.S.
officials in mid-January during a follow-up to this year's
Structural Impediments Initiative bilateral trade talks.
   Among the companies warned by the commission were market
leaders Nihon Cement Co., Onoda Cement Co., Sumitomo Cement
Co. and Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement Co. Company officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
