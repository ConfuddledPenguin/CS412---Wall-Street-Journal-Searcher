   The executive who has suffered through the most
embarrassing annual meeting so far this year is probably Otto
N. Frenzel, chairman and chief executive of Merchants
National Corp.
   The bank holding company disclosed during its meeting
Tuesday that the 59-year-old Indianapolis executive has
agreed to personally pay off about $1.5 million in defaulted
loans that a bank unit made in 1988 to a friend, art dealer
Peg L. Goldberg.

   Ms. Goldberg, who had been introduced to the lending
officers by Mr. Frenzel, used the loan to buy four
sixth-century Byzantine mosaics that turned out to have been
taken from the ceiling of a church in North Cyprus.
   A few months after the bank lent the money, Mr. Frenzel
became an investor in the project to resell the mosaics --
portraits of Jesus and the apostles Matthew and James.
   Ms. Goldberg tried to sell the mosaics to the J. Paul
Getty Museum for $20 million. But the mosaics sparked a
landmark case on whether foreign governments can recover
stolen art in a U.S. court. In September, a federal district
judge ruled that the mosaics should be returned to the Greek
Orthodox Church.
   Ms. Goldberg appealed the decision. But she can't sell the
mosaics so she doesn't have the means to pay off the debt.
   Mr. Frenzel, who couldn't be reached for comment, was
cleared by an internal investigation of any wrongdoing. But
he decided to pay off the loan because "it did cause some
embarrassment for the corporation as it was handled by the
news media," a spokesman said.
   Mr. Frenzel, whose annual base salary was listed in the
proxy as $379,300, didn't mention the mosaics during his
speech to shareholders. However, James D. Massey, president,
announced the agreement.
   Mr. Frenzel "wants to put this to rest," the spokesman
said.
