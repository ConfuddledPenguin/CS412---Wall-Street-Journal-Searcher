   In a further sign that a year-old chip slump may be
ending, LSI Logic Corp. said it expects to report a return to
profitability for its first quarter after two quarters of net
losses.
   The chip company today expects to post net income of $2.1
million, or five cents a share, for the first quarter ended
April 1. That compares with net of $8 million, or 19 cents a
share, a year earlier, said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI's
chairman and chief executive officer. The Milpitas, Calif.,
company earlier was expected to report a slight net loss for
the quarter, he said.

   Mr. Corrigan attributed the favorable results to growing
strength in chip demand as well as to investments in more
efficient factories. LSI's first-quarter sales were up 3.8%
to $139 million, compared with $133.9 million a year earlier,
he said. "There's been a strong up-tick in business," he
said. "What we're seeing is the industry coming out of a slow
period into an expansion period."
   LSI's surprise earnings improvement adds to other signs of
a reviving chip industry. The industry's leading indicator,
the so-called book-to-bill ratio, is at its highest level
since July 1988. Other chip companies, including Intel Corp.
and Motorola Inc. reported improved chip revenue in their
latest quarters. Cypress Semiconductor Corp., reporting
improved earnings earlier this week, said a sudden increase
in demand has left some chips in short supply. Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. partly attributed a first-quarter net-income
increase of 30% to a rise in orders late in the period.
   According to a survey of electronic-parts buyers published
by Electronic Purchasing, a trade journal, "More signs show
that the U.S. electronic industry may be leaving the doldrums
behind." According to the survey, "more buyers are placing
larger orders of electronic parts . . . and most say prices
and stockpiles of parts are stabilizing."
   LSI's improved profits are welcome relief for the company
after a string of bad quarters. The company's net income
began slipping in the second quarter of 1989, and LSI saw a
third-quarter net loss of $35.7 million that included a
special restructuring charge. LSI ended the year with a
fourth-quarter loss of $1.7 million and a net loss of $24.9
million for the entire year.
   "The third quarter of last year was the bottom of the
recession" in chips, said Mr. Corrigan. LSI's earnings were
also hurt last year by the cost of shutting down old factory
lines and setting up and improving new ones, including lines
in Europe and Japan.
   Analysts were expecting the company to report a
first-quarter net loss of about four cents a share, LSI said.
But demand picked up throughout the quarter, and the
company's book-to-bill ratio, the ratio of new orders to
shipments, for the quarter grew to 1.2 to 1 from about 1.1 to
1 in the previous quarter, Mr. Corrigan said. The
first-quarter net income includes a $955,000 extraordinary
gain, or two cents a share, on retired convertible debt, he
added.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
LSI stock closed at $9.25, up 50 cents.
   LSI's first-quarter profit also reflects improved profit
margins from its more efficient factories, which are
operating at higher capacity than last year, Mr. Corrigan
said. Gross margins were 29% for the quarter, up more than
two percentage points from the prior quarter, he said. "We
feel we've gone in and straightened out a lot of the
problems," he said. And with the improved chip market, "we've
got the wind at our back."
   LSI's order backlog and the new factories augur well for
the current quarter, when increased orders will translate
into revenue growth. Mr. Corrigan said he expects revenue in
the second quarter ended July 2 to grow 10% over first
quarter revenue. He also said he expects net income per share
to be in the double digits.
   Mr. Corrigan said he expected added revenue this year from
new products, such as a previously introduced LSI chip set
that allows computer makers to build clones of a popular Sun
Microsystems Inc. workstation. "There's no question that the
introduction of microprocessors has created a burst of
activity" from which significant sales volume will come by
the end of the year, he said. Those microprocessors will
generate sales in other LSI chips too, he said.
