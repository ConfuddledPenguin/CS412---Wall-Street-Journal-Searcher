   NEW YORK -- Short interest for the month ended April 12
was about flat on the New York Stock Exchange and rose 6.2%
to a record on the American Stock Exchange.
   On the Big Board, Chemical Banking Corp.'s short volume,
which had been inflated by an arbitrage play, plunged as
short sellers covered their positions. The Indianapolis
pharmaceutical concern Eli Lilly &amp; Co. posted the biggest
increase in short volume.

   The New York exchange reported that short interest inched
down to 613,933,904 shares at mid-April from 614,559,232
shares at mid-March. On the Amex, short volume rose to
70,931,396 shares from an adjusted 66,776,615 a month
earlier.
   For the year-earlier month, Big Board short volume was
556,831,364 shares, a year-to-year rise of 10.2%. A year ago,
the Amex reported 43,663,617 shares, indicating a 62% climb.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio rose to 4.19 from last month's 3.94. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position.
   Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has
weakened in value as an indicator because options and other
products can be used to hedge short positions.
   Short volume for the New York parent of Chemical Bank sank
to 2,359,516 shares from 17,257,721 shares. Arbitragers had
been selling Chemical's shares short and then covering their
positions with shares bought at a discount under the
company's dividend-reinvestment plan. Chemical later
tightened the rules of the plan.
   Eli Lilly's short volume grew to 10,270,405 shares from
7,917,352. Uncovered short sales for the bellwether issue
International Business Machines Corp. rose 3.8% to 4,053,955
shares from 3,903,455. Exxon Corp.'s short volume slipped
5.5% to 5,581,248 shares from 5,912,126.
   Leading the Amex short volumes, as it has for some time,
was Texas Air Corp. The airline holding company's short
volume dropped 7.2% to 8,817,325 shares from 9,506,412.
   The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in
which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares
existed as of mid-April or in which the short position had
changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-March (see tables
-- WSJ April 20, 1990).
