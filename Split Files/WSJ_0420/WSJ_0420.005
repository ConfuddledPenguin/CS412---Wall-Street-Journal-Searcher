   Japanese shipbuilders signed contracts to build 208 ships
with a total gross tonnage of eight million metric tons in
the fiscal year ended March 31, an increase of 43% from 5.62
million metric tons a year earlier.
   The Japan Shipbuilders' Association attributes the strong
performance to bullish sentiment toward the world economic
situation and fears by customers that shipbuilders might not
have the capacity to meet increased demand for certain types
of vessels.
   Citing the case of Very Large Crude Carriers, the
association asserts 300 VLCCs must be replaced in coming
years, but that world shipyards can only build 10 annually.
   The Japan Shipbuilders' Association also notes that
environmentalist pressure in the U.S. for legislation
requiring tankers to be double-hulled could lead to
additional new orders for VLCCs.
                                                                                                       

   ENTERPRISE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
                                                                                                       

   Czechoslovakia's parliament has approved long-awaited laws
permitting private enterprise and the establishment of joint
stock companies. The private-enterprise law stipulates that
anyone can establish a business without seeking official
permission. There are no limits on the number of employees or
capital involved in a firm, and private business is allowed
in all spheres. The new measures permit the issuing of shares
to individuals, groups and companies, and allow the
"reasonable" participation of foreign capital in the
Czechoslovak economy.
                                                                                                       

   BURMESE ELECTIONS
                                                                                                       

   Western diplomats expect Burma's May 27 elections -- the
country's first multi-party polls in 29 years -- to be an
army-rigged farce. And Burmese military ruler General Saw
Maung has done little to change this pessimistic assessment.
In a Wednesday speech at the Defense Ministry in Rangoon, he
defended the stringent rules his government has imposed on
campaigning and access by opposition parties to
statecontrolled radio and television. "We cannot allow a
party to do something freely if it affects the freedom of the
public," he said.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE RENTS
                                                                                                       

   The cost of renting office space in Singapore has risen
79% since December 1988, according to data compiled by
property consultants. Office rent is expected to rise by 20%
to 30% in 1990 as available space continues to shrink. New
office space, which has been built at an average yearly rate
of 1.2 million square feet in recent years, fell to 530,000
square feet in 1988 and 213,000 square feet last year.
                                                                                                       

   CELEBRATING PLASTIC
                                                                                                       

   Plastic, the miracle material hailed as one of the most
important inventions since the wheel, has become the subject
of a major museum exhibit. London's Victoria and Albert
Museum has turned over a whole section to synthetics, ranging
from computer keyboards to imitation fruit. While museum
officials have tried to exalt the scientific importance of
plastic, most visitors appear drawn to nostalgic items, such
as cups and plates in ice cream colors, cheap vinyl
furniture, ornate sunglasses, and blond Barbie dolls.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN TAXES
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission unveiled a two-stage
plan aimed at getting EC member states to narrow differences
in corporate-tax rates.
   The first step would be the adoption by governments of tax
legislation to encourage companies to do business across
national borders, as part of the EC's plan for a single
market by the end of 1992. The second would be to explore how
the EC can reconcile differences in national tax systems with
the smooth functioning of the unified market.
   The EC tax commissioner, Christiane Scrivener, said the
commission dropped a 1975 plan to put corporate taxes in a
band of 45% to 55%. Instead of standardization, she said, it
wants to follow a more pragmatic policy of coordination. "Our
aim must be to let companies take full advantage of the
single market," she said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   According to the Albanian state news agency, Albania's
Communist Party chief Ramiz Alia has outlined economic
reforms, including some private farming, designed to increase
production and improve supply. But he rejected the sweeping
liberalism that has ended Communist rule in most of Eastern
Europe. . . . Some Taiwan doctors are warning trendy young
people against alleged health hazards of the "lambada."
According to Taipei's United Daily News, the physicians claim
the dance's sinuous Brazilian rhythms and close body contact
could cause "excessive blood flow," rendering partners
"dysfunctional."
