   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
banks in New England and other regions have tightened their
lending standards but it's too soon to say that a credit
crunch is choking the economy.
   In written answers to questions posed by the Senate
Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed believes banks
are reacting to changing economic conditions, bad loans and
"ongoing scrutiny by regulators."

   "Such tightening could reduce the amount of credit
provided to businesses and consumers . . . with potential
effects on the level of local economic activity," Mr.
Greenspan said. But responding to a query about Massachusetts
from Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), the Fed chairman said a
credit crunch "would most likely need to be prolonged and
more severe than we have been able to detect" before it
threatens the economic stability of New England.
   Mr. Greenspan, who said the Fed seeks a prudent balance
between too much restraint on the part of bankers and too
little, noted that bank lending essentially didn't grow at
all in December and January. In February, it grew at an
annual rate of 5.3%. For all of 1989, he noted, bank lending
rose 7.6%. Loan growth in the Northeast and Southwest has
been weaker than the national average. That can reflect
bankers' reluctance to lend or customers' reluctance to
borrow in an uncertain economy or both.
   Mr. Greenspan added that the large losses reported by
thrifts throughout the 1980s and, more recently, by
commercial banks "suggests that financing activity in the
real estate industry, in particular, has been excessive."
   Mr. Greenspan disclosed new Fed data showing that the 50
largest bank-holding companies at the end of last year had
$125.5 billion in loans outstanding to highly leveraged
transactions, a 50% increase from the end of 1988. So far,
those loans, which include bank lending for debt-financed
takeovers, are performing better than other kinds of loans,
the Fed data show. But the proportion of loans for highly
leveraged transactions that are going sour is on the rise.
   The Fed currently is conducting special examinations of
certain banks with high concentrations of such loans "to
determine if significant deterioration is taking place," the
Fed chairman said.
