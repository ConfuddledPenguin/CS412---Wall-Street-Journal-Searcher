   World oil prices surged after OPEC used a pricing tactic
that has served it well in the past -- the scheduling of a
meeting of the oil ministers.
   North Sea crudes spurted as much as 90 cents a barrel in
European spot markets, and one U.S. crude-futures contract
increased even more, after Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil
minister and acting president of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, set May 2 as the date for
beginning an emergency meeting in Geneva of the market
monitoring committee.

   Although that policy-setting committee has only eight
ministers, Mr. Boussena invited all 13 of OPEC's oil
ministers to attend the meeting, indicating that it could be
turned into a full OPEC conference. He then postponed to June
25 the regular midyear conference, which previously had been
scheduled to start May 25.
   The May 2 meeting "will examine the measures needed to
halt the constant degradation of the market and to raise
prices so as to re-establish them at the level set by OPEC,"
Mr. Boussena said.
   The announcement sparked heavy trading in most of the
world's oil markets, with prices immediately beginning to
rise. Accelerating the rally were traders who had bet on
further price declines and had to quickly buy contracts to
cover their positions.
   "There was a lot of `short' covering; gasoline was very
strong, but the real interest was in crude," said Eric
Bolling, an energy futures trader in New York with Edge
Trading Corp.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for
May delivery spiraled up 2.23 cents a gallon to settle at
61.78 cents, while the June motor fuel contract jumped the
limit of two cents a gallon. Heating oil futures also were
up, with June and later months showing the bigger gains.
   But the star in futures trading was West Texas
Intermediate crude for May delivery. Analysts said it went up
faster because more traders had bet against it in recent
weeks as prices plummeted. Also, today is the May contract's
last trading day; that may have contributed to the
volatility.
   Whatever the reason, May WTI gained $1.10 a barrel to
settle at $18.06. The June crude contract was up 78 cents to
$18.87.
   Although analysts and traders generally attributed most of
the day's price run-ups to the OPEC announcements, few were
prepared to predict whether previously depressed oil markets
had indeed turned around. "I won't say prices have bottomed,"
said Mr. Bolling, "but they should be trading higher" in the
days ahead.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices continued their recent pattern of
moving over a narrow range. The May contract ended with a
gain of 0.40 cent a pound at $1.1660. Nearterm tightness of
supplies is reflected in the premiums being enjoyed by
soonest-to-expire positions in both London and New York over
more deferred contracts. That, plus the continuing Peruvian
miners and smelter workers strike, now in the sixth week,
remain the principal underlying price-supporting factors, one
analyst noted. However, according to William O'Neill, vice
president for research for Elders Futures Inc., New York,
some progress may be taking place in the Peruvian labor
situation. Union leaders representing the workers of Southern
Peru Copper Corp., who walked off March 12, have scheduled a
meeting with company officials, he said. Also, Mr. O'Neill
said, workers who went on strike at the same time at a
separately owned mine, Tintaya, have returned to work.
"Although no agreement has been reached, it has been reported
that union leaders have received an offer they're willing to
accept," he said. While improvement is possible in the
Peruvian situation, he said, it is still unsolved and is
offsetting some of the concern over recent economic
statistics that indicate a slowing economy, particularly
weaker auto sales and poorer employment statistics. The
automobile industry is a major copper-user. Traders who
follow charts also appear to be more cautious, Mr. O'Neill
noted, since there appears to be resistance around the
$1.20-a-pound level for the May contract "and definitely
major resistance at around $1.25."
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn, wheat and soybean
futures contracts rallied late in the trading session
yesterday amid continuing rumors about the Soviet Union's
interest in making major purchases. At the Chicago Board of
Trade, wheat prices were also supported by concerns about
tight supplies of soft red winter wheat. Supplies of the
crop, which is grown in the Midwest, usually reach their
tightest levels in the spring before the new wheat crops
begin to be harvested. As a result, concerns about a squeeze
on wheat supplies are traditional in April. Despite the
rally, the prospects for the wheat crop in the U.S. continue
to improve, according to Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., New York. Fields in the Southern Plains,
where the hard red winter wheat crop is grown, are generally
in their best condition since the 1988 drought began. Some
dry regions of the Pacific Northwest are expected to get
moisture this week.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog futures contracts rose
amid reports that the slaughter continues to lag behind
normal levels because of tight supplies of fattened hogs. The
low slaughter is causing strong prices of hogs during a time
of the year when prices are usually their weakest. After the
close of trading today, the Agriculture Department is slated
to release its quarterly survey of feedlots in 13 major ranch
states. Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill., said he expects the department to
report that the number of cattle on feedlots in those states
rose 1% on April 1 from the same 1989 date. That would be the
largest number in feedlots, which fatten cattle for
slaughter, during an April 1 survey since 1978. Traders
expect the report to indicate that the cattle slaughter
during the second quarter will be heavy.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell back from Wednesday's gains on
a denial by the Soviet Union that it had bought sugar in the
free market. The July contract ended with a loss of 0.26 cent
a pound at 15.30 cents. This decline erased slightly more
than half of the 0.48 cent gain posted Wednesday. Arthur
Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New
York, said that an official of Sakhar, the Soviet sugar
trading corporation, stated that the Soviet Union hadn't
bought sugar on the world market. "While that is the answer
one would expect, because they aren't going to reveal such
information," Mr. Stevenson said, "I tend to believe them
this time." Apparently, most traders also thought that way,
because many decided to take profits, he said.
