   PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a health maintenance
organization, said it plans to make an offer to acquire
Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a rival HMO that has been
operating under bankruptcy-law protection for 13 months.
   Peter J. Ratican, Maxicare chairman and chief executive
officer, responded, "We have made it clear for more than a
year that Maxicare is not for sale, so we are, quite frankly,
puzzled by the timing of this announcement, which comes just
two business days before a crucial public hearing on our
reorganization efforts."

   PacifiCare, based in Cypress, Calif., said it plans to
deliver a proposal to Maxicare and its creditors' committees
prior to a Santa Ana, Calif., bankruptcy-court hearing
scheduled for Monday to consider Maxicare's previously filed
reorganization plan.
   PacifiCare declined to discuss any terms.
   Roughly 40% of Los Angeles-based Maxicare's 320,000
members are in California. PacifiCare said 70% of its 636,000
members are in California.
