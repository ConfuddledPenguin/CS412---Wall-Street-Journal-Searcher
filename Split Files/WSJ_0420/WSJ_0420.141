   Great American Bank disclosed that its underperforming
assets jumped 42% in the fourth quarter, contributing to its
previously reported net loss for the period and casting a
pall over the thrift's survival plans.
   On Dec. 31, Great American reported underperforming assets
of $645.6 million, compared with $453.4 million on Sept. 30,
according to a regulatory filing with the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The company's total "classified" assets, a
broader measure of actual or potential loan problems, rose
59% to $1.30 billion from $814.6 million at Sept. 30, the
filing said.

   The increases help explain the $198.9 million, or $8.30 a
share, net loss that the company reported on Tuesday for the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with year-earlier
profit of $19.8 million, or 80 cents. The capital-consuming
effect of the deficit, and other problems, has left San
Diego-based Great American, the nation's eighth-largest
thrift with $15.9 billion in assets, on the verge of having
to sell or dismantle itself or face possible federal seizure.
   On Tuesday, Great American said it was making provision
for loan and foreclosed real-estate losses of $271.2 million,
but declined to specify the size of its troubled-loan
portfolio. According to the OTS filing, the company had loss
reserves on Dec. 31 equal to about 19% of its underperforming
assets, excluding previous write-downs, and had set aside
reserves or taken write-downs equal to about 35% of its total
troubled assets.
   Analysts said the growth in troubled assets, largely
reflecting a disastrous 1986 acquisition of an Arizona
thrift, will complicate Great American's efforts to save
itself. At year-end, according to the filing, roughly 23% of
the thrift's total $2.6 billion of assets in Arizona were
considered real or potential trouble. The company must raise
$350 million in new capital by year-end as part of a
regulator-approved plan unveiled earlier this week to comply
with minimum federal capital standards.
   A Great American spokesman said the company considers its
loss reserves to be adequate. He added: "We are still
discussing the bank with a number of qualified investors, and
are proceeding with our operations according to our capital
plan."
   The three biggest California banks -- BankAmerica Corp.,
Security Pacific Corp., and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. -- are
interested in expanding in the lucrative San Diego market and
are considered potential bidders for Great American.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Great American slipped 37.5 cents to $3.625.
