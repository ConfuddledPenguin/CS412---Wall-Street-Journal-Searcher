   HOUSTON -- Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group, said that it is considering selling Triton Biosciences
Inc., its wholly-owned health-care subsidiary, which develops
pharmaceuticals and diagnostics for serious illnesses, and
that it retained Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York as
financial adviser for the project.
   Shell said it views Triton as "a successful health-care
operation," but decided "after extensive review . . . that
Triton is not sufficiently related to {Shell's} principal
petrochemical business to retain it for the long term."
Triton has about 300 employees in Alameda, Calif.
