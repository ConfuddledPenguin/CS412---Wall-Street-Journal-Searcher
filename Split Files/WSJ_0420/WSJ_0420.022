   NEW YORK -- Union Pacific Corp. first-quarter net income
declined 7%, largely because of higher interest costs related
to a stock repurchase program. But it said railroad and
natural-resources earnings were strong.
   The company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., sidetracked plans to
dispose of its natural-resource assets. Drew Lewis, chief
executive, told a meeting of securities analysts here that he
decided not to undertake at an initial public offering of the
company's Union Pacific Resources unit at this time.

   Union Pacific posted first-quarter net of $128 million, or
$1.27 a share, compared with $138 million, or $1.22 a share,
a year earlier. The increase in per-share earnings reflected
the decline in the average number of common shares
outstanding to 100.6 million from 112.9 million a year
earlier due to the share buy-back program.
   Mr. Lewis said Union Pacific Railroad earnings increased
2% to $127 million, despite the sluggish economy and higher
fuel costs. The company said quarterly carloadings were up 2%
over the year earlier quarter. Union Pacific Resources'
income increased 31% to $63 million with hydrocarbon volumes
rising 8%.
   Mr. Lewis said he expects the company to meet or slightly
exceed analysts' estimates of 1990 net per share of $5.60 to
$5.85 a share. In 1989, Union Pacific earned $5.62 a share.
   First-quarter earnings of Union Pacific's trucking unit,
Overnite Transportation, declined 33% to $8 million from $12
million. Union Pacific also said its corporate services costs
of $73 million in the first quarter represented a $22 million
increase from the year-earlier quarter, largely due to the
increased interest costs associated with the buy-back
program.
   The executive said he decided against an initial public
offering of the company's oil and gas resources. "We just
don't see the value we think this company is worth being
realized by an IPO," Mr. Lewis said. He added after the
meeting that "IPO's are not doing well. I'm not going to put
{Resources} out now and have a turkey."
   Mr. Lewis said he would not recommend an initial public
offering of Union Pacific Resources unless "we see the asset
value of the company considerably north of $4 billion. I'm
not going to do it at $3 billion." Union Pacific's outside
advisers had valued Resources in the neighborhood of $3
billion, he said.
   Some analysts were disappointed because they had expected
a further restructuring of the company's resources unit;
Union Pacific had sold off its pipeline and refining
properties in late 1988. Mr. Lewis was still talking publicly
last January about the possibility of an initial public
offering for a portion of Union Pacific Resources. Union
Pacific continues to liquidate most of its real estate
holdings.
   "Union Pacific has decided to develop its resource assets
with the available cash flow from the railroad rather than
simply giving ownership to the shareholders," said Michael
Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. After the
announcement, Mr. Lloyd changed his Union Pacific rating to a
"neutral" from a "buy." He said, "If Union Pacific Resources
was a free-standing company, oil and gas analysts would pay
more attention to it, and perhaps it would attract some
suitors."
