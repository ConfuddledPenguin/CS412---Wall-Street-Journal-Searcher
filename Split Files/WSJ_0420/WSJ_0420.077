   BONN -- The big IG Metall metal workers union rejected an
offer by the employers federation to discuss a further
shortening of the workweek to 35 hours once the competitive
situation in the European Community will allow it.
   The union, which is calling for a cut in the workweek and
a 9% pay increase, said the employers' offer, which also
included some concessions regarding weekend work, represented
"cosmetic changes to a hopelessly obsolete model."

   The union's rejection of the employers' new opening
underlined the lack of progress in the difficult 1990 wage
negotiations. IG Metall, which represents more than 2.6
million workers in important sectors of the West German
industry, has said it will stage warning strikes at certain
companies in early May.
   The employers federation said it wanted to set "objective
criteria" that would determine extent and timing of a cut in
working hours after 1993. Union officials said such criteria
would mean indefinite postponement of the shorter workweek.
