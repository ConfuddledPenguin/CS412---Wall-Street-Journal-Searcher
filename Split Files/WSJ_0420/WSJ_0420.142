and bed parts. Dresher manufactures brass beds.

   Earlier this month, Leggett began a $2.50-a-share tender
offer for all of the common stock outstanding valued at about
$11.5 million. Leggett said that depending on the timing of
the response to the Justice Department, the tender offer may
be extended beyond the May 4 expiration date.
   Leggett &amp; Platt said that it intends to respond promptly
to the request and that it believes the purchase doesn't
violate antitrust laws.
