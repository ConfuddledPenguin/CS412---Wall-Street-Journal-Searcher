   Fremont General Corp. said its board voted to reject a
$140 million offer for its Fremont Compensation Insurance Co.
subsidiary made earlier this week by Catalina Acquisitions
Inc.
   The subsidiary is "not for sale," said James A. McIntyre,
chairman and chief executive officer of Fremont, an insurance
concern based in Santa Monica, Calif. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, Fremont shares closed off
$1 at $16.50 a share.
