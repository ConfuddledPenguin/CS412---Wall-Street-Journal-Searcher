   BASF AG said it will raise its 1989 dividend 8% to 13
Deutsche marks ($7.78) a share from 12 marks and will pay an
additional one-mark bonus to celebrate the company's 125th
anniversary.
   The dividend announcement by the West German chemical
group had been expected by analysts after BASF last month
reported an 18% jump in 1989 group pretax earnings to a
record 4.38 billion marks.

   The total amount distributed to shareholders will climb
17% to 798 million marks from 684 million marks in 1988, and
the addition to reserves will be boosted to 600 million marks
from 500 million marks, BASF said.
   The dividend payment still has to be approved by the
company's annual shareholder meeting June 28.
