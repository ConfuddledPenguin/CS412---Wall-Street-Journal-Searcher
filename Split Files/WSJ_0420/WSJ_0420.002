   WASHINGTON -- Americans will fail to pay at least $100
billion of the federal income taxes they owe this year,
according to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T.
Goldberg Jr.
   The largest chunk of unpaid revenue is owed by sole
proprietors such as lawyers, doctors and restaurateurs,
according to General Accounting Office officials who
testified with Mr. Goldberg before the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee.

   If all the money due were collected, it would largely
erase the federal budget deficit. But the government isn't
likely to collect more than a quarter of it unless the
Internal Revenue Service strengthens its enforcement
programs, Mr. Goldberg said.
   According to an IRS report released at the hearing, the
so-called tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and
taxes actually paid -- was between $82.5 billion and $94.2
billion in 1987, the most recent year complete tax data are
available. Mr. Goldberg projected that it could reach $110.1
billion to $127 billion in 1992.
   And that's only counting the federal income tax on legal
income. Mr. Goldberg said the agency is working on estimates
of unpaid taxes from illegal transactions, such as drug
dealing. Private calculations put the tax gap over $200
billion if illegal income and unpaid state taxes and other
taxes are included.
   It is impossible to wipe out the tax gap entirely, and Mr.
Goldberg indicated that the IRS has little interest in
aggressively pursuing babysitters and other "folks scrapping
to get by." But he did identify four business sectors where
noncompliance is particularly acute, and he vowed to toughen
IRS efforts to bring in the money owed.
   Sole proprietors underpaid their federal income tax
liabilities by about 23% in 1987, accounting for about $16.6
billion, or 20%, of the tax gap for the year, according to
the GAO, which analyzed the IRS data. Those underpayments
reflected both unreported income and excessive deductions,
the IRS said. Mr. Goldberg said the IRS has begun an auditing
program to examine taxpayers in this category with over
$100,000 in gross receipts.
   Large corporations -- defined by the IRS as those with
more than $10 million in assets -- underpaid about $15.8
billion in 1987, 19% of the tax gap. Banks and petroleum
companies were the biggest offenders, the GAO said. The IRS
said improper accounting, whether deliberate or not, caused
much of the underpayments.
   Informal suppliers -- proprietors who often deal in cash
and usually have no regular hours or place of business --
underpaid about $7.7 billion, or about 9% of the tax gap in
1987, the GAO figured. Frequent culprits were roadside food
vendors and people hired to make home repairs or provide
child care.
   And small corporations underpaid federal income taxes by
about $5.2 billion, accounting for about 6% of the tax gap in
1987. Only half the businesses with $50,000 or less in assets
fully complied with the tax law, the government estimated.
The compliance rate for businesses with assets between $5
million and $10 million was far higher, 90%.
   The IRS estimates the tax gap primarily using information
from audits. The agency cautioned that the precise amount of
unpaid taxes is extremely difficult to determine.
   While Mr. Goldberg said the extent of uncollected revenues
"is certainly a cause for concern," he stressed that taxpayer
compliance hasn't slipped. Rather, he said, the tax gap has
grown along with overall revenues.
   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the IRS has failed to
reduce the tax gap partly because audit rates have plummeted
over the past decade. In 1978, for example, the IRS audited
7.42% of small corporations; in 1989, it audited only 1.61%.
In 1978, 47.82% of large corporations were audited; by 1989
the rate had fallen to 25.52%.
   "It will take many years to restore audit coverage to
appropriate levels," Mr. Goldberg said. "It's high time we
start."
   Criminal prosecutions of tax cheaters also have declined
as the IRS has focused more of its resources on bringing
legal action against drug dealers and organized crime,
officials said.
   Mr. Goldberg said that modernizing the agency's outdated
computer system and better educating taxpayers on the laws
also will bring about increased compliance.
   The subcommittee urged the agency to do better. "I think a
country who is up to its neck in debt and deficits ought to
think about how we get the money from the deadbeats before we
raise taxes on those who do pay," said Rep. Byron Dorgan (D.,
N.D.).
