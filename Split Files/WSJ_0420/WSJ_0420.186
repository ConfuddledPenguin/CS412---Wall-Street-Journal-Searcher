   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration was urged
to require that Halcion, a popular sleeping pill, carry a
stricter warning label that cautions users about potential
side effects.
   An FDA advisory committee recommended last September that
the label on the Upjohn Co. product warn users that they may
suffer temporary amnesia. But the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, a public-interest lobby, petitioned the FDA
yesterday for even stricter labeling requirements, including
a warning that Halcion is more likely than other sleeping
pills to cause delirium, depression and hallucinations.

   A spokeswoman for Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn denounced
the petition as "medically unjustified and unnecessarily
alarming to millions of patients who have been or are being
successfully treated with Halcion."
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the public interest group's director,
charged that the FDA failed to release to the advisory
committee a 1988 study by two FDA scientists that was highly
critical of Halcion. The study said that complaints passed by
Upjohn to the FDA raised serious questions about Halcion
compared to other sleeping pills. The study also argued that
the large number of consumer complaints about the drug could
not be attributed to critical stories in the media.
   Dr. Paul Leber, director of the FDA's division of
neuropharmacological drug products, said the unpublished
study was "not the same as an agency report," and had "no
official standing." He added, "I don't think there's anything
in that manuscript that wasn't presented to the committee."
Another FDA study of Halcion, also critical of its side
effects, was presented at the September meeting.
   FDA officials said that they will review the Public
Citizen petition.
