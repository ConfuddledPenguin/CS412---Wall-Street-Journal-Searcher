   HEWLETT, N.Y. -- Anchor Savings Bank, to meet capital
requirements, said it will take a $175 million write-down and
expects to sell 68 Anchor branches and more than $2 billion
in deposits.
   As a result of the write-down, Anchor reported a loss for
its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 of $169.4 million, or
$9.87 a share, compared with a loss of $1 million, or 26
cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the one-time charge,
Anchor had a net loss of $3 million, compared with a loss of
$7.3 million a year ago.

   The write-down is part of Anchor's compliance with a plan
approved by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision to
eliminate a $331 million capital shortfall. The plan is meant
to bring Anchor into capital compliance within two years by
selling assets.
   Anchor is expected to sell bank branches, mortgage
servicing rights, mortgage loans and other assets that could
total about $140 million.
   The bank will also convert cumulative preferred stock for
non-cumulative stock, or an instrument which can be counted
as core capital, adding about $157 million in capital.
   James M. Large Jr., chairman of Anchor, said under the
plan the bank will "refocus on its traditional markets" in
northern New Jersey, New York City and Long Island,
concentrating on consumer deposits, homeowner mortgages,
supporting services.
   Mr. Large said Anchor will sell its branches in Georgia,
Florida and southern New Jersey. Some branches in northern
New Jersey may also be sold.
   Under general accounting standards, the anticipated branch
sales require the write off of $175 million in supervisory
goodwill. The goodwill was created when Anchor acquired
branches through a series of government-related mergers in
the early 1980s.
   After the sale, Anchor will have $8 billion in assets, of
which $5 billion will be deposits. The bank, in the last
year, has reduced staff from about 3,200 to its current level
of about 2,100.
