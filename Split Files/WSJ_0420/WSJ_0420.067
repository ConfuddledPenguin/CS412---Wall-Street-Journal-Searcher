   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. and Japonica
Partners, a New York investor group trying to take over the
company, accused each other in court of the same thing
yesterday: vote buying.
   Although charges flew, neither emerged as a clear winner
in the battle to lead the maker of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

   Allegheny's reorganization plan calls for the majority of
its creditors to be paid in stock, while Japonica's plan to
buy Allegheny for $655 million would reimburse creditors in
cash.
   Allegheny said Japonica bought enough bank claims in
recent weeks to make it the company's largest creditor and
then used its position to vote against the company's plan.
Allegheny attorneys argued yesterday that Japonica wasn't
acting in good faith as a creditor but only to scuttle the
company plan and further its own.
   The company said, for example, that Japonica began
acquiring bank claims only after it decided to propose its
own plan and that it paid a premium to get the claims
critical to give it a blocking position.
   In an interesting twist, Japonica said that Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., which tried to buy
Allegheny three times in the last two years, has returned and
is now involved in buying bank claims. Japonica produced a
letter from DLJ to Allegheny's secured banks saying that DLJ
"clients" were interested in buying their claims outright as
long as enough were sold to create a blocking stake.
   Japonica charged that DLJ is tied to Allegheny management,
and that the DLJ acquired stake would be used to vote against
the Japonica plan. Japonica said that Allegheny tapped James
D. Milligan to head its new management team and that Mr.
Milligan worked closely with DLJ. In fact, he was DLJ's
choice for Allegheny's chief executive officer when DLJ was
courting the company.
   Meanwhile, the company's banks and unsecured creditors
strongly urged the court to nullify Japonica's vote against
the company plan. They argued that Japonica, by blocking the
company plan to further its own, is trying to hold them
hostage to the Japonica plan.
