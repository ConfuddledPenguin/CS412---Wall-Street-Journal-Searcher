   A St. Louis developer is suing the Federal National
Mortgage Association, claiming that the agency has declined
to finance projects in a section of North St. Louis because
it is too blighted.
   The suit is the first in the nation against Fannie Mae to
allege redlining, the practice by lenders of rejecting loan
applications in poor neighborhoods. Filed by developer Bruce
Ring, the suit seeks $103.5 million in damages against both
Fannie Mae and First Interstate Mortgage Co. of Illinois, its
local agent in St. Louis.

   Fannie Mae is a federally chartered, publicly owned
company that stimulates housing development in poor and
moderate-income neighborhoods by buying mortgages and
refinancing them at reduced rates to qualified developers.
   A Fannie Mae spokesman said this is the first time the
company has been accused of redlining. "Fannie Mae does not
accept or condone or permit redlining in any fashion," said
David Jeffers. "All you have to do is look at our
underwriting standards and see that is something we take very
seriously." The agency says it has provided refinancing for
four projects in North St. Louis.
   Mr. Ring's allegations are being investigated by Sen. John
C. Danforth, (R, Mo.), and Reps. William L. Clay and Richard
A. Gephardt, both Democrats from St. Louis. All three have
asked Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp to
investigate.
   Mr. Ring applied to Fannie Mae through First Interstate
last August to refinance $3.6 million in short-term loans so
he could renovate seven run-down apartment buildings in St.
Louis. Five of the buildings are in the city's depressed
northern section. According to his suit, filed in U.S.
District Court in St. Louis, Fannie Mae rejected the entire
application after a First Interstate assistant vice-president
inspected the properties.
   According to the suit, the bank official described two of
the properties as "pioneer locations," adding that he "would
not personally want to invest in either location." Another
location, he wrote, "definitely had some rough areas within a
few blocks."
   Mr. Ring is asking for $100 million in punitive damages
plus $3.5 million, which he says is the difference between
his aggregate mortgage payments over 35 years through
conventional financing and the 8.1% rate available through
Fannie Mae.
   Pretrial hearings in Mr. Ring's suit are scheduled for
April 27.

   COMPANIES MUST DISCLOSE shaky finances to some applicants,
a Colorado court rules.
   An employer may not have to divulge its financial
condition to every job applicant it interviews, the Colorado
Court of Appeals said. But full disclosure is required if a
company has made statements to an applicant that would create
a "false impression" about its outlook and the applicant's
future employment prospects.
   The decision earlier this month upheld a jury's award of
$250,000 in damages to Roberta Berger, who had sued Security
Pacific Information Services Inc. for fraudulent concealment
arising out of her hiring and termination by the Denver
company.
   Ms. Berger was recruited by the company, and had moved
from New Orleans to Denver to accept a job in January 1986.
She was terminated some eight months later, after the
computer project she had been hired to manage was
discontinued. Ms. Berger contended that in interviews for the
job, Security Pacific Information had presented a positive
picture of the company and her future, concealing its
financial losses and the "substantial, known risk" that her
project might soon be abandoned.
   The appeals court upheld a jury award that included nearly
$92,000 in actual damages, covering lost earnings and losses
on the sale of a house Ms. Berger bought in Denver. Punitive
damages made up the balance of the award.
   Andrew T. Brake, a Denver attorney who represented Ms.
Berger, noted that Colorado is a state that permits employers
under certain conditions to terminate a worker without cause
under a so-called employment-at-will law.
   Attorneys for Security Pacific Information couldn't be
reached for comment.

   CHIEF ATTORNEY IN AT&amp;T antitrust litigation will open his
own law firm.
   George L. Saunders Jr., a partner with the Chicago law
firm of Sidley &amp; Austin, is leaving the firm in June to open
his own law firm. He hopes to recruit a small group of
"older, successful lawyers" who want to leave big-firm
practice, he says.
   Mr. Saunders, 58 years old, is not taking any business
with him, including American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the
client that brought him national attention. Mr. Saunders was
AT&amp;T's lead trial counsel in the long-running antitrust
litigation brought by the Justice Department and MCI
Communications Corp. that led to the breakup of the Bell
System.
   H. Blair White, a Sidley &amp; Austin partner, says he was
surprised Mr. Saunders decided to leave after 28 years at the
firm. "It's a very ambitious thing to do in your career at
that point," Mr. White says. Sidley partner Howard J.
Trienens said Mr. Saunders has been frustrated by having to
turn away some business because of conflict-of-interest
problems with other clients of the law firm.
   Mr. Saunders says he has long contemplated the move.
"Maybe you could call it a midlife crisis," he says.

   JUDGE CLEARS THE WAY for lawsuit accusing Exxon and Conoco
of rigging oil prices.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge William Conner
rejected the oil companies' motions to dismiss the suit,
which was filed in 1986 by Transnor Ltd., an oil trader based
in Bermuda. The suit accuses Exxon Corp., Conoco Inc. and a
Conoco subsidiary of conspiring to depress certain crude oil
prices in order to evade taxes in Britain. It seeks damages
totaling about $261 million, stemming from losses Transnor
says it suffered because of the lower prices.
   Transnor accused the companies of forcing down the price
of Brent oil, a widely traded North Sea crude oil, by selling
cargoes of the oil at below-market prices. Transnor had
bought two cargoes of Brent oil, but then refused to accept
delivery after the market value plunged. Transnor alleges
that after forcing the oil prices down, the oil companies
were able to use a trading technique know as tax spinning to
increase profit margins on the refined oil products. Britain
taxes refinery profits at a lower rate than crude oil
profits.
   Exxon and Conoco argued that the case should be thrown out
on several grounds -- including their claim that a conspiracy
is unlikely because they would have hurt themselves by
depressing oil prices. Judge Conner, however, said it is
plausible that the alleged pricing scheme's tax benefits and
other advantages could have offset the companies' lower crude
oil revenue.
   The oil companies, which previously have said the suit is
without merit, also claimed that the case should be dismissed
because the Brent oil market is an international market. They
argued that a U.S. court has no jurisdiction in such
disputes. But Judge Conner said that most of the trading in
oil contracts is done in New York and Boston.
   A spokesman for Exxon said the company was disappointed
that Judge Conner refused to dismiss the case. Officials at
Conoco, a unit of Du Pont Co., couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Edward Swan, an attorney for Transnor, said the trial is
set to begin May 21.

   BASKIN FLAHERTY suffers Pittsburgh defections.
   Half the members of the Pittsburgh office of Baskin
Flaherty Elliott &amp; Mannino, a Philadelphia-based regional law
firm, have resigned, including name partner and former
Chairman Philip Baskin.
   Mr. Baskin left last week. About 15 of Baskin Flaherty's
32 lawyers in Pittsburgh also have left to begin their own
firm. All of the defections took place amid rumors of
dissatisfaction over the direction of the firm.
   Baskin Flaherty is developing a more specialized practice
in complex litigation, financial services, health law and
environmental law, said the firm's President Edward F.
Mannino, who specializes in banking litigation, and John M.
Elliott, also a name partner.
   The Pittsburgh office, said Mr. Elliott, was more oriented
toward less sophisticated litigation in domestic relations,
personal injury and real estate, which Mr. Elliott said were
not compatible with the firm's goals.
   "It's a question of how you emphasize things," said Mr.
Baskin. "We happen to think that while the new area is very
important and should be properly addressed, you don't throw
the old things out, too."
   Baskin Flaherty is currently filling the positions and
opening a seven-lawyer office in Washington D.C.
   In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, the firm recently hired Charles
Sheehey, former U.S. attorney for the Western District of
Pennsylvania, as head of that office's litigation department.
