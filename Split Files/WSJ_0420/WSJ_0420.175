   Cara Operations Ltd., a Toronto-based food services
company, said it agreed in principle to acquire Grand &amp; Toy
Ltd., a wholesale and retail distributor of stationery and
office supplies.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but Cara said the purchase price
would be funded by internal resources and borrowings. It said
part of the price may be raised through the issuance of as
many as one million Class A nonvoting shares at the sellers'
option. Cara's Class A shares were unchanged at 15.75
Canadian dollars (US$13.56) on the Toronto Stock Exchange
yesterday. Cara has about 19.8 million Class A shares
outstanding.

   Grand &amp; Toy, which is controlled by the Grand family of
Toronto, has annual sales of about C$285 million, Cara said.
Officials at both companies couldn't be reached for comment.
The transaction is subject to negotiation of a final
definitive agreement.
