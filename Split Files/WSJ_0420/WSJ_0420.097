   Before Congress passes the sweeping Americans With
Disabilities Act it might consider the unintended
consequences of its most recent efforts to help the disabled.
Amendments to the Fair Housing Law passed in 1988 mandated
that all multifamily housing units built in this country from
now on must be accessible to the handicapped. Several groups
representing the disabled warn that the new rules are so
expensive that many disabled people will be priced out of the
housing market completely.
   Congress didn't worry much about costs or definitions of
"accessibility." Senator Paul Simon put the cost at "pennies
a month," while Senator Tom Harkin assured that the
amendments included only "low-cost or no-cost features." Then
reality hit.

   The Department of Housing and Urban Development, given the
actual task of implementing the congressional edict, proposed
guidelines in January. These require that every public area
be accessible to the handicapped; that kitchens, bathrooms
and doorways all be designed to handle wheelchairs; and that
hilly sites be regraded and ramped for better access. The
guidelines would add at least four inches to doorways,
increasing the size of apartments by more than 5%. They would
also require that all bathrooms be enlarged. Up to 90% of
hilly housing sites must be regraded and fitted with long
ramps.
   Jack Powell, executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, says he was shocked by the proposed guidelines.
His group estimates the cost of the HUD rules at $900 million
a year. He has an alternative. This past fall, a coalition of
home builders and 13 disabled groups formed a task force to
draft guidelines for accessibility that both sides could live
with. They said, for example, that one accessible bathroom in
each unit would be enough. HUD instead turned over drafting
of the guidelines to a group of building inspectors.
   Mr. Powell says the HUD proposals would cost twice the
amount of his task force's recommendations -- adding between
$1,300 and $3,700 in costs for each walk-up apartment and
from $3,200 to $4,300 for a high-rise unit. That comes to
typical increases between 2% and 5%. Each $1,000 in costs
adds $10 a month in rent.
   "That rent increase could be as big a barrier to the
handicapped as a two-foot curb," says Michael Rose, a
Maryland builder confined to a wheelchair. "Affordability is
part of accessibility." He notes that the disabled tend to
have lower incomes and are most in need of affordable
housing.
   But HUD officials say they are bound by Congress's vague
command to make housing accessible without taking cost into
account. White House officials say they will review the
economic impact of the HUD regs but make no promises.
Meanwhile, activists for the homeless have been strangely
quiet on these new higher housing costs.
   Congress and President Bush need to do some hard thinking
about what benefits the disabled and what just placates the
extreme activists. Just one provision in the Americans With
Disabilities Act, that buses install lifts and toilets for
the handicapped, will cost at least $200 million -- more than
the entire industry's annual profits. Many unprofitable
routes likely will be dropped.
   Affordability is key to accessibility. The disabled won't
be helped if physical barriers are replaced by the economic
barriers of excessive regulation.
