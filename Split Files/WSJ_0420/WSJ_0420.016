   MANILA -- An electricity crisis and persistent rumors of a
new coup attempt are frightening off foreign investors,
threatening the economic recovery that began under President
Corazon Aquino.
   At the same time, inflation has reached double digits.
Officials are warning that failure to meet government
spending targets will weaken the Philippine peso and drive up
interest rates, further threatening capital investment.

   Since taking power in 1986, President Aquino has pointed
with pride to the revival of the Philippine economy, which
has grown 5% to 6% anually the past two years.
   But failure to invest in new generating equipment, along
with a drought on Luzon island, has brought about a critical
electricity shortage. The government has announced a power
rationing program affecting more than 300 public and private
companies.
   The energy crisis has already begun to take its toll by
discouraging foreign investors. Philip Chien, president of
the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the
Philippines, told the Business Star newspaper that most
Taiwanese investors here have decided to relocate. Taiwan had
been the fastest-growing source of foreign investment here
the past three years.
   Mr. Chien said some Taiwanese were willing to wait a few
months to see if the electricity crisis would ease, but he
added: "We don't think it will stabilize."
   He said government plans to purchase gas turbines to
increase generating capacity would probably drive up
electricity rates too high.
   Meanwhile, Manila is awash in rumors that military
dissidents, responsible for a failed coup in December, are
preparing for a new bid to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   Despite the arrests of several key figures in the December
coup attempt, most of the suspected core group of planners
remain at large.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos warned that public
discontent over rising prices and the power crisis might
encourage another coup attempt.
   The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, has advised
Americans not to travel to eight areas in the Philippines
because of continued problems of crime and insurgency. At
least eight Americans have been killed in communist
insurgency-related incidents in the country in the past four
years.
