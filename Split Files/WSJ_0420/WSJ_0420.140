   LOS ANGELES -- The cost of a biography is rising at
Occidental Petroleum Corp., where shareholders are financing
Volume 2 of Chairman Armand Hammer's exploits.
   According to proxy material, the Los Angeles-based oil and
chemical company spent $195,000 last year on the book's
ghostwriting, bringing total outlays for the project to
$450,000 at year end. Occidental said it's committed to at
least an additional $30,000 plus expenses for the volume.

   A company spokesman said the manuscript, which is as yet
untitled, has been completed. Publication is expected later
this year.
   The 91-year-old Dr. Hammer has co-authored the new volume
with Neil Lyndon, a British author with whom he wrote the
1987 tome "Hammer." Occidental has received $680,000 in
royalties from that book, apparently less than the company
advanced for its writing.
   Volume 2, said the proxy material, "will describe Dr.
Hammer's world-wide endeavors since {1987} in international
affairs, art and other philanthropic concerns, as well as
significant domestic and international business activities of
Occidental."
   The latest work will be Dr. Hammer's fourth
autobiographical installment, the earliest of which was
penned in the 1930s, with a second volume in 1975.
   An unauthorized biography by journalist Steve Weinberg,
published last year in the U.S. by Little, Brown &amp; Co., takes
a somewhat darker view of Dr. Hammer than the
corporate-financed volumes. Dr. Hammer has launched an
elaborate legal action in England against Mr. Weinberg and
the book's British publisher, alleging that under that
country's narrower libel laws the book defames him.
