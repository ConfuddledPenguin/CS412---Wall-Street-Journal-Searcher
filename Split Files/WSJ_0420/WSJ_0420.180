   ELKINS PARK, Pa. -- Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust said it
suspended its fiscal second-quarter dividend, as a result of
its April 12 filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The trust previously declared a 45-cent-a-share dividend
for the first quarter ended Dec. 31.

   The trust said it will present promptly a plan of
reorganization to be discharged from the Chapter 11
proceedings in time to make a dividend payment prior to June
5, 1991. The trust would thereby preserve its status as a
real estate investment trust for the current fiscal year
ending Sept. 30.
   If this dividend payment schedule isn't met, net income
reported for the six months ended March 31 would be reduced
by a provision for income taxes of approximately $3.8
million. The trust is self-administered, with investments in
floating-rate real estate loans and equities.
