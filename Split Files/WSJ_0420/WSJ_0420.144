   MADRID -- Telefonica de Espana S.A. is considering
increasing its stake in Chile's telecommunications system and
taking shareholdings in telecommunications operations in
Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico and New Zealand, a senior
official of the Spanish state-controlled telephone company
said.
   Enrique Used, director of Telefonica's international
operations, said these plans are part of a strategy to
counter expected competition in its home market as European
telecommunications are deregulated.

   In Chile, Telefonica has stakes in two companies, Cia. de
Telefonos de Chile S.A., or CTC, and Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones de Chile, or Entel.
   Subject to clarification of legal issues, including points
relating to Chile's competition laws, Mr. Used said,
Telefonica is discussing plans that could lead to its
increasing its 20% stake in Entel to 40%.
   He also said Telefonica is considering bidding for part of
Argentina's state-owned telecommunications company under its
forthcoming privatization, and negotiating with potential
partners for participation in a similar operation in New
Zealand.
   The Argentinian government has said it will split its
telecommunications concern into two parts, covering the north
and south of the country and parts of Buenos Aires, and sell
each to private bidders. It has invited companies interested
in submitting bids to present applications this month.
   Mexico and Puerto Rico have indicated they will privatize
their telecommunications services, though they haven't
announced details. New Zealand, meanwhile, is considering
privatizing its telecommunications services, Mr. Used said,
though he declined to elaborate.
   Earlier this month, Telefonica completed its $388 million
purchase of a controlling stake in CTC from Bond Corp.
International Ltd. It also recently bought an additional 10%
of Entel, of which it had already had 10%, for $23 million
from a vendor representing the Chilean armed forces.
   CTC, which controls most of Chile's internal
telecommunications, had profit last year of $95 million on
revenue of $268 million, Mr. Used said. Telefonica will own
43.7% of CTC's shares, once a pending capital restructuring
operation is concluded.
   Entel, which operates Chile's intercity and international
links, limits the maximum holding in its shares by any holder
to 20%. But Mr. Used said Telefonica has approached other
Entel holders to discuss the possibility of raising this
limit to 40%. If this is approved, he said, Telefonica may
seek to acquire the 10% Entel holding owned by Banco
Santander of Spain, as well as shares from other potential
vendors.
