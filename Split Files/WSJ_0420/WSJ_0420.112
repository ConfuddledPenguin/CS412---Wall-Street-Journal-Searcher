   With more than 2,000 trading advisers registered with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finding a professional
to steer you through the commodity markets shouldn't be any
trouble.
   The problem is finding one with a good chance to make you
money. The most obvious way to select a CTA, simply comparing
recent investment returns, can be a big mistake.

   Commodity trading advisers, or "CTAs" as they're known,
spend their days (and sometimes their nights) trying to make
a profit for their clients, buying and selling everything
from soybeans to Japanese yen futures. Investors can hire
CTAs directly, by going through an "introducing broker" who
has established relationships with several CTAs, or by buying
units in a publicly offered commodity fund that employs one
or more CTAs.
   As with most types of investing, the temptation is just to
compare track records. But investors who select CTAs by
looking only at their recent performance are apt to be
disappointed.
   That's the conclusion of an analysis by Richard Oberuc,
president of Burlington Hall Asset Management Inc., a
Hackettstown, N.J., firm that develops software to track
CTAs. Using a data base supplied by Managed Account Reports,
a newsletter that tracks managed futures money, Mr. Oberuc
ranked the performance of 135 active CTAs in 1987 and 1988.
   He found that the top five CTAs had an average compound
annual return of 112% over the period. But 1989 was another
story. Those same five advisers lost an average 4.1%; the top
performer, which turned in a 170% average annual gain in
1987-88, lost 39.9%.
   Instead of focusing on annual returns, many investment
professionals say, investors should zero in on a commonly
accepted measure of risk called the "maximum drawdown."
That's the largest peak-to-valley percentage drop in a CTA's
account value.
   Ken Tropin, chairman of the Managed Futures Trading
Association, says he looks at how frequently bad periods
occur -- and at how deep they are, relative to the good
periods.
   The object is to find a CTA with a high average annual
return, with the lowest possible drawdown. Dividing the
average annual return by the maximum drawdown, is one way to
quantify the reward-to-risk relationship.
   In the table accompanying this article, for example, the
CTA with the highest average annual return in the three years
through last December is Trout Trading Co., with a 62.2%
average gain. Trout, however, had a maximum drawdown of 8.5%.
Dividing the return by the drawdown gives a reward-risk ratio
of 7.3.
   A more cautious choice might be Hickey Financial Services.
While its average annual return of 21.6% was only about a
third of Trout's, its maximum drawdown was only 1.9% --
giving it a reward-risk ratio of 11.4.
   When comparing CTAs, most industry observers say,
short-term track records are all but meaningless. "As a
professional, I think I can judge a CTA with only a
three-year track record, but I believe the general public
should look for a five-year record," says Mr. Tropin.
   Mr. Oberuc of Burlington Hall also recommends looking at
longer periods. "You want to see how a CTA performs in as
many different kinds of markets as possible. If a CTA can
make money in a 1989-type market, that is a good test."
   People in the business say it's critical for investors to
find out how much money a prospective CTA has under
management. A track record produced with $250,000 isn't
meaningful, most professionals say. But having too much can
also be a problem. Some CTAs who can manage small sums come
apart when the amount exceeds $5 million.
   The size effect is attributed to several factors. One is
that as the amount of funds under management gets larger, the
CTA tends to become timid and reduce his position size,
thereby diminishing his return. Also, when managed funds get
very large, it might be impossible for a manager to deploy
them effectively. This occurs because of position limits
imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that set
a ceiling on the number of contracts that can be held for a
single customer. Very large CTAs might wind up holding assets
mostly in Treasury bills.
   Mr. Tropin says he would look for a CTA that has managed
at least $5 million, but preferably $10 million. John
Frawley, president of ML Futures Investment Partners Inc., a
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says he also would look
for at least $10 million of customer funds under management.
   The pros also suggest some additional screening factors.
The 10 CTAs in the accompanying table, for example, are ones
identified by Mr. Oberuc as having average annual returns of
at least 15% and maximum drawdowns of no more than 20% in the
three years through last December. To make the list, a CTA
also had to have been trading during the entire three years
and still be accepting new investors.
   While nearly all of the CTAs in the table require sizable
minimums to open an account, some introducing brokers have
put together private pools that let investors access some of
the best with a relatively small investment. For example,
Steben Asset Management Inc., Bethesda, Md., has such a pool.
It employs AZF Commodity Management, Fundamental Futures
Inc., Tiverton Trading Inc. and Trout as CTAs, but requires
only $25,000 to open an account. Investors with as little as
$10,000 to put into action can do so through a private pool
offered by Manhattan Advisory Services Inc. This pool uses
several CTAs, including Trout.
