   OPEC's runaway production, the cause of the recent oil
price slide, is slowing down, apparently because buyers are
simply refusing to absorb any more.
   Signs of an involuntary cutback began to surface yesterday
even as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
called an emergency meeting aimed at reducing output and
reversing the price slide. The session is to begin May 2 in
Geneva.

   The expectation that OPEC might regain production
discipline produced at least a brief turnaround in the
depressed oil market, pushing some crude prices up as much as
$1 a barrel.
   But just in the last week or so, the organization's
production already has been trimmed by 400,000 to 600,000
barrels a day, according to confidential reports by people in
and out of OPEC who monitor its production.
   That puts total OPEC output at around 23.5 million barrels
a day -- still 1.5 million barrels over the ceiling but well
below the eight-year high of 24 million barrels a day that
was reached only two to three weeks ago. That level of output
sent world petroleum prices skidding.
   People who monitor OPEC output said the cutbacks appear to
be widespread and reflect a shortage of buyers -- and tankers
-- for OPEC's flood of oil, and not any sudden resurgence in
the organization's ability to keep its chronic quota cheaters
in line.
   "There is too much oil chasing too few buyers, and some
member countries are throttling back," said a senior OPEC
official.
   The lower OPEC output is coming at a critical time for
world oil markets. Production probably isn't low enough yet
to eliminate the oil glut, but it is likely to resurrect
earlier industry projections of firming oil markets by late
this quarter, or certainly in the second half.
   Barring recessions in the bigger oil-consuming nations,
petroleum demand is widely projected to increase in the
second half. For OPEC, that rise is expected to translate
into a gain of two million barrels a day or more from its
current level.
   The second quarter is traditionally a sluggish period for
oil demand. Although estimates vary widely, demand for OPEC
oil is estimated to be running at 21 million to 22 million
barrels a day currently. But up until the last several days,
OPEC continued to pump oil at much higher rates, averaging
some 23.8 million barrels daily in March.
   As a result, OPEC oil has begun to back up in storage and
at sea.
   It is difficult to say exactly how much oil might be at
sea at any given time. "But it's safe to say that it's the
highest we have seen for this time of the year in the last
two or three years," said a European tracker of oil tankers.
   Roy Mason, a Yorkshire, England, oil statistician and
publisher of Oil Afloat, which monitors tanker traffic,
estimated that there are currently 430 million barrels of oil
at sea. That's below the 450 million barrels on the water at
the beginning of this year but well above the 385 million
barrels a year ago, he said.
   More important, a larger than usual portion of the oil
appears to be owned by producing countries instead of traders
or refiners, he said. "What may well be true," he said, "is
that there is more unsold oil on the water than in the past
two years."
   It isn't for lack of trying that producers don't have more
buyers. Nearly all OPEC members -- from Saudi Arabia, the
largest exporter, to Ecuador, one of the smallest -- recently
have been sweetening pricing terms, offering new discounts.
   Yesterday, Ecuador oil officials confirmed an offer to
reduce the pricing formula for their export crude, calculated
on the basis of spot prices of some other crudes, by 40 cents
a barrel. But not all customers have accepted the new offer,
which came after lengthy negotiations. So Ecuador may have to
store even more of its oil in tankers in the Caribbean.
   Ecuador isn't alone. Iran is said to have at least five
and perhaps as many as eight so-called VLCCs (very large
crude carriers) full of unsold oil off Europe.
   Energy Security Analysis Inc., which monitors supplies of
oil onshore, estimated 1.54 billion barrels of crude oil were
in inventories at the end of March. That was up sharply from
the 1.45 billion barrels it measured at the end of March
1989.
   Edward N. Krapels, president of the Washington firm, said
that Energy Security's crude oil index is indicating a "large
surplus" for the first time in 15 months. The index measures
crude supplies in terms of days of refinery operations.
   "Sooner or later," said Mr. Krapels, "there has to be a
production response" to the buildup of crude inventories
because "the buyers aren't there."
   New tabulations show that production response already has
come from some countries. Several OPEC members aren't
producing as much as their quotas allow. Although three big
Persian Gulf producers -- Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
and Saudi Arabia -- remain above quota, their output appears
to be slipping. Current output of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
kingpin with a quota of 5.4 million barrels a day, is said to
be around 5.9 million. But much, if not all, the extra oil is
understood to be going into storage.
   The May 2 meeting of the oil ministers is intended to
obtain voluntary cutbacks by all the overproducers. "We
should be able to get reductions at least for a couple
months," said a senior official in one of the OPEC
delegations.
