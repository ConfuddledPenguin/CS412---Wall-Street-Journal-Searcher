   Two-tier pay scales, the rage of corporate cost-cutters in
the 1980s, are being pummeled at the bargaining table these
days.
   In more than 650 labor contracts negotiated between 1984
and 1989, new hires wound up on lower pay scales than their
senior co-workers in a variety of industries, including
retail food chains, airlines, metal fabrication and lumber.

   Now, a growing population of restive lower-tier workers
are putting the heat on companies and unions alike to
eliminate separate wage scales. "We like to describe it as
mortgaging the unborn," grumbles Chris Manno, a second-tier
pilot at American Airlines of Dallas, where a two-tier system
accepted by its unions in 1983 resulted in new hires getting
up to 50% less than employees already on the payroll.
   With many industries facing a shrinking labor pool,
second-tier voices are being heard. Already, the gap between
tiers has shrunk in some existing dual-pay plans, such as
American's; in a few cases, the whole structure has been
scuttled.
   Meanwhile, despite some notable exceptions -- Lockheed
Corp. machinists and Northwest Airlines pilots recently
agreed to two-tier contracts -- both labor and management are
shying away from new ones. With hundreds still in effect,
such pacts aren't in immediate danger of extinction. But,
according to the Bureau of National Affairs, a private
research firm, only 6% of the 962 non-construction contracts
negotiated in 1989 contained two-tier plans, down from a peak
of 11% in 1985.
   "They're always going to be around, but I think they're
going to be fairly rare in 10 years," says Wayne State
University economist James E. Martin, author of a recent
study on the subject.
   Two-tier contracts spread during the recession-ridden
early 1980s, as companies scrambling to keep up with
deregulation and growing nonunion and foreign competition
pressed their workers for concessions. Union members acceded
in many cases, opting to secure their own jobs and wage
levels instead of accepting across-the-board cuts.
   In many early contracts, second-tier workers could never
earn as much as their senior co-workers because the two
scales never merged. Many new hires also got less insurance
coverage, vacation time and pension benefits.
   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard says the two-tier
system was "the growth plan that kept us alive" during the
early 1980s, when American found itself besieged by
lower-priced competition such as People Express. American
thought it could cut labor costs significantly as attrition
and growth increased the percentage of B-scalers on the
payroll. Under the two-tiered system, American has grown
sharply, from 39,000 workers in 1983 to almost 80,000 today.
   But the hiring of lower-tier workers has proved to be a
double-edged sword. As the economy recovered in recent years,
many companies poured their savings from lower wages into
expansion, hiring more lower-paid workers. That, in turn,
meant a flood of new members and added clout for many unions.
But the new members were often second-tier workers who, as
their numbers grew, became more vocal in opposing the
two-tier system.
   Consider the United Food and Commercial Workers Union,
whose locals probably agreed to more two-tier contracts than
any other union. These days, the union is pushing employers
to merge the scales. The main reason, says Bill Olwell, UFCW
executive vice president for collective bargaining, is
pressure from second-tier members: "They're becoming closer
to a majority and we're a political organization, so we're
responding to them."
   Last year, UFCW members' demands for equal pay triggered
an 81-day strike against unionized food chains in Seattle.
The result was a 27% raise for lower-tier employees, compared
with about 9% for more senior workers. Eight of the 19
two-tier agreements renegotiated by the UFCW in 1989 resulted
in higher pay increases for second-tier workers than the
first-tier.
   Among the 17,000 American Airlines employees represented
by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants,
"B-tier" attendants have begun wearing "Killer B" pins under
their lapels. During a recent union election, one slate of
candidates was defeated, in part because pamphlets were
circulated outlining their involvement in negotiating
American's initial two-tier contract.
   Not all unions have been split by the two-tier
arrangements. In 1988, senior flight attendants at Alaska
Airlines agreed to a two-year pay freeze so that their
lower-tier employees could get a 10% raise. Elsewhere, senior
employees have agreed to accept lump-sum payments in lieu of
the raises given to lower-tier employees.
   Johnny Rodriguez, president of a UFCW local representing
580 Dallas meatcutters, says senior employees have discovered
that lower wages for new hires make it more difficult for all
employees to get raises. "They realized that without a strong
foundation, the house can collapse," he says.
   But even with the two-tier system under fire, a few
companies still resort to it. Lockheed did so this year
because it needed to attract more highly skilled workers
while cutting wages for lower level jobs to meet spending
guidelines on government contracts. "I really don't care for
a two-tier wage system because it creates too many personnel
problems," says Louis J. Barnard, Lockheed's vice president
for human resources. "But the alternative is to cut people's
pay, and nobody likes that."
   In many cases, companies have begun merging their pay
tiers and granting lower-tier workers larger pay increases
just to attract workers amid a shrinking labor pool. "Union
wages have been held down so much that there is sometimes no
advantage to having a B-tier because you can't hire new
workers cheaper anyway," says Peter Cappelli, a management
professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania.
   Giant Food Inc., a Washington area grocery chain,
gradually decreased the pay differential between the two
tiers from $3 an hour in the early 1980s to about $1.50 now.
"The work force in the Washington metro area has just been
shrinking in the last half-dozen years," says Eric Weiss,
Giant's director of labor relations. "By increasing the rate,
we increased the labor pool we have to select from."
   Some experts contend that labor shortages and union
discontent are less responsible for the decline of two-tier
contracts than the overall improvement of the economy since
the early 1980s. "You don't have as many companies that are
under the gun in terms of reducing their labor costs," says
Mark A. de Bernardo, director of labor law for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. If the country slips into another
recession, he says: "you're going to see them more prevalent
again."
   Union leaders say they'll fight any such resurrection, but
many admit that they're not sure how their current members
would handle the decision that thousands of workers faced a
decade ago. "It was a shrewd move by management," laments
Gordon Brehm, an executive with the United Paperworkers
International Union. "It's human nature for people to say,
`Well, it's not going to hurt me and the people who come
tomorrow can look after themselves.'"
