   Pulitzer Publishing Co., citing lower profit at its
flagship St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper and the effect of
certain accounting actions, said first-quarter net fell 70%.
   Net income fell to $906,000, or nine cents a share, from
$3 million, or 29 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue rose 1.1% to $95.2 million from $94.1 million.

   The St. Louis-based company said continued softness in
advertising, especially at the Post-Dispatch, left publishing
revenue 1.9% below the year-earlier quarter, although
broadcasting receipts climbed 10%. "We anticipate a difficult
year at the Post-Dispatch in 1990," said Joseph Pulitzer Jr.,
company chairman. First-quarter earnings were also hurt by
higher depreciation and amortization costs connected with the
acquisition in December of WDSU-TV in New Orleans.
