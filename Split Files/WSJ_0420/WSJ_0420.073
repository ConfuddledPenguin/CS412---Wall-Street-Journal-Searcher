   LOS ANGELES -- "Rationality" is finally returning to the
high-stakes leveraged buy-out market, says Timothy M.
Pennington III, co-founder of Brentwood Associates.
   After going nearly two years without a buy-out
transaction, the LBO and venture capital firm this week
completed a $143 million management-led buy-out of Mobile
Technology Inc., a closely held provider of diagnostic
imaging equipment to the health-care industry.

   The completion of the deal represents the flip-side to the
woeful tales coming from the big New York buy-out firms. In
many ways, the recent failures of some big junk-bond financed
buy-outs have helped end the drought for Brentwood.
   Like many smaller firms, Brentwood found itself priced out
of the market in the past few years, as easy access to
junk-bond financing allowed companies to command ever higher
purchase prices. "Whereas a transaction might have been good
at five to seven times a company's earnings before income
taxes, we were seeing a lot going for eight-to-10 times, even
one at 14 times," Mr. Pennington says.
   Ironically, when the bidding for Mobile Technology began
last year, the company was too pricey for Brentwood's taste.
"The auction process started with the auctioneer saying,
`Here's the hurdle.' We said we wouldn't jump over it. So we
didn't attend the auction," Mr. Pennington recalls. "There
was a period of time where the company thought they'd go
elsewhere at the higher price. Ultimately, {Mobile
Technology} came back to us."
   In addition to the lower pricing that has come with the
collapse of the junk-bond market, the deals getting done
these days will include more equity and less leverage, Mr.
Pennington says. "The equity requirement had gone down to
just 10% to 12%. Now we're moving to a 15% to 20% equity
requirement," he says.
   The Mobile Technology buy-out includes equity of $23
million, or 16%, of which $20 million was contributed by
Brentwood from a $140 million buy-out fund raised at the end
of 1988. The rest of the purchase price includes $60 million
of senior secured debt and $60 million of subordinated debt.
   Ronald D. Van Horssen, president and chief executive
officer of Mobile Technology, said the buy-out will allow the
company "continued growth," noting that Brentwood's
philosophy is "to grow a company rather than sell assets or
adopt a no-growth strategy to finance the restructuring."
   Mobile Technology had 1989 revenue of about $76 million.
Founded in 1983, the company provides mobile magnetic
resonance imaging services to about 400 hospitals in 35
states. The company has 465 employees.
   Brentwood, with more than $470 million in assets, has
completed buy-outs of Prince Manufacturing Inc., a tennis
racket maker, and Educational Publishing Co., among others.
Brentwood's most recent buy-out was of Tuboscope Corp. in
1988, purchased from Minstar Inc. for about $136 million.
Tuboscope was taken public last month.
