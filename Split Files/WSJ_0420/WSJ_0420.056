   Venture capitalists, sated on computer chips and disk
drives, are turning to the environment.
   "Environmentally related start-ups are attracting more
venture capital as money moves away from crowded and
less-profitable computer and electronics businesses," says
Harry Healer, managing partner of Venture Capital Fund of New
England.

   In recent months, for instance, venture-capital firms say
they have invested in such concerns as Galson Remediation
Corp., a Syracuse, N.Y., company that is selling technology
to clean up dioxins and PCBs, and In-Process Technologies
Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., provider of industrial-waste
processing systems. Recyclers such as Partek Corp. of
Vancouver, Wash., and disposal companies such as American
Waste Services Inc. of Youngstown, Ohio, also are benefiting.
   Venture-capital firms invested more than $100 million in
such companies during the past two years, according to Oliver
Nicklin, president of First Analysis Corp., a Chicago
investment research firm. Before that, he says, the total of
these types of investments was very small.
   Until 1988, venture capitalists often avoided
environmentally related investments because they "didn't
understand the industry" and lacked the expertise to evaluate
complex regulatory and legal issues surrounding it, contends
Mr. Nicklin. Besides, they were preoccupied with computers
and other fields related to electronics.
   But nowadays, start-ups in environmentally related
products and services have larger growth prospects than most
electronic-technology deals, says Jonathan Flint, a partner
at Burr Egan Deleage &amp; Co., a big Boston venture-capital
firm.
   The demand for new environmental products and services has
increased as regulators have gotten tougher, other industry
observers note. "There's greater urgency over finding ways to
clean up the environment," says Mr. Healer.
   For reasons such as these, Mr. Healer's Venture Capital
Fund and Burr Egan Deleage have invested a total of $3.5
million in Galson Remediation. Galson has a patented
chemical-treatment technology to clean up the dioxins and
PCBs that pollute such sites as Times Beach, Mo., and Love
Canal, N.Y. This technology offers an alternative to
incineration, says Richard Tavelli, president of Galson.
   Unlike incineration, which has created concerns about
emission and other hazards, Galson's method takes place in a
closed reactor. "Our system answers many of the community
concerns about on-site waste incinerators," Mr. Tavelli says.
With hundreds of sites nationwide polluted by dioxins and
PCBs, the clean-up market is huge, he adds.
   Such large markets have been a major selling point for
other companies as well, says Franklin Agardy, chief
executive officer of In-Process. His company is developing a
patented non-thermal system that can take toxic gases from
industrial processes and convert them to nontoxic materials.
Venture-capital firms last October invested $1.9 million in
the company. In-Process, which already has sold a large
system to a Dow Chemical Co. plant in California, says its
market is over half a billion dollars in size. "Even with a
small piece of the market, we could end up as a sizable
company," Mr. Agardy says.
   At the same time, many venture-capital investments in
companies producing computers and other electronic equipment
have turned sour lately. According to Technologic Computer
Letter, an industry newsletter, venture capitalists put only
$1.1 billion into electronic-technology companies in 1989 --
a decline of about 12% from the previous year.
   In a business increasingly dominated by a few big,
well-financed and technically diversified companies, there
are fewer niches offering profitable returns, venture
capitalists complain. And the niches that remain don't
promise the explosive growth that companies such as Apple
Computer Inc., Lotus Development Corp. and Compaq Computer
Corp. experienced.
   But some small investments in environmentally related
companies have paid off handsomely. A total of $600,000 that
Venture Capital Fund of New England invested in Groundwater
Technology Inc., a Norwood, Mass., pollution-control concern,
between 1982 and 1984 had grown to well over $16 million at
the end of 1988. And an estimated $1 million invested by Mr.
Nicklin's venture funds in Tetra Technologies Inc., a
Woodlands, Texas, recycling and waste-treatment concern, now
is valued at about $6.5 million. Tetra went public earlier
this month.
   But the market for environmentally related products and
services goes beyond traditional waste treatment, disposal,
and recycling, venture capitalists say. Plant Resources
Venture Funds, Boston, for example, is an investor in BioTrol
Inc., a Chaska, Minn., company that has developed a microbe
that degrades certain kinds of toxic and hazardous wastes.
Grace Ventures Corp., Cupertino, Calif., last year invested
$1 million in Bio-Care Inc. The Campbell, Calif., concern
uses a benign bacteria to clean drain pipes and grease traps.
And IAI Venture Capital Group, Minneapolis, has invested
$700,000 in Mycogen Corp., a San Diego company that uses
genetic-engineering techniques to produce biologically safe
pesticides.
   Opportunities in these areas will continue to grow,
predicts venture capitalist Yuval Almog of IAI. But
successful commercialization will depend on the level of
environmental awareness world-wide, not just in the U.S., he
says.
   Indeed, U.S. entrepreneurs are basing their growth on
international demand. As environmental concerns heighten in
European and Asian countries, "we are hoping we'll be the
first with some of the solutions they need," says Galson's
Mr. Tavelli.
   Still, some venture capitalists are cautious about
investing in environmentally related ventures. Investors must
be particularly cautious about legal liability, especially
when investing in companies that directly handle waste, warns
venture capitalist Matthew Mackowski of Robertson Stephens &amp;
Co., San Francisco.
   Moreover, he points out, demand for products and services
in this area still depends on the vagaries of government
regulation. Federal funds for cleaning up the environment
were allocated as far back as 1986, he notes, but they never
generated new businesses because the laws weren't vigorously
enforced.
