   TOKYO -- Amid growing expectations that world trade with
Eastern Europe could expand significantly, Japanese business
and government leaders have been stepping up their research
efforts in the region.
   The Japan Federation of Employers' Associations said it
will send a 20-member research mission to Eastern Europe in
late September to study economic and labor conditions.

   The organization's goal is to get an idea of what type of
economic cooperation governments and businesses in Eastern
Europe are most eager to receive from Japanese business, and
what lessons Japanese business-labor practices and
administrative practices might offer, a spokesman said. The
mission will travel to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
from Sept. 23 to Oct. 4, he said.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union-East Europe Office of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry is heading a
similar mission to Poland and Hungary. The mission of
ministry's Economic Investment Environment Research Group is
to study the conditions for private investment opportunities,
such as infrastructure, an official said.
   The 70 Japanese executives and government officials on the
ministry's mission traveled to Poland last week, and were in
Hungary this week, he said, noting that this mission differs
from that of the employers' federation in focus but still
reflects the same principle of gaining a better understanding
of business and economic conditions in Eastern Europe.
   Though results won't be reported until the group returns,
the leader of the ministry's mission in Poland indicated that
the market there is potentially attractive, as the country
has made progress in curbing inflation and stabilizing its
currency.
   But he said the overhaul of the legal structure to support
a market economy and the development of infrastructure must
be followed closely, a Japanese daily reported.
   In addition, various Japanese cabinet members, including
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and Health and Welfare
Minister Yuji Tsushima, plan to visit the region separately
this year.
