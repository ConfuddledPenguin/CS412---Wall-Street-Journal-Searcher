   BROOKLYN UNION GAS Co. (New York) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on the first mortgage
bonds and industrial revenue bonds of this natural gas
company to single-A-1 from double-A-3. Approximately $600
million of debt is affected. The rating concern said its
downgrade reflects expected continued deterioration in
Brooklyn Union Gas's interest and cash flow coverages, partly
caused by sizable capital expenditures, as well as inadequate
rate relief.

   MANUFACTURERS HANOVER Corp. (New York) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. raised its ratings on Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. and its Manufacturers Hanover Overseas Capital Corp.
unit's senior debt to triple-B-plus from triple-B. About $3.9
billion of debt is affected. The upgrade reflects a
significant improvement in the capital structure of the firm
as a result of a $750 million equity issue in late 1989 and
the sale of a 60% interest in CIT Group Holdings, S&amp;P said.

   NATIONAL EDUCATION Corp. (Irvine, Calif.) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it lowered to triple-C-minus from
single-B-minus its rating on this vocational training
company's $57.5 million face amount of 6.5% convertible
subordinated debentures, due 2011. The rating concern said
its downgrade reflects National Education's "substantial
debt-service requirements and limited liquidity caused by the
unsuccessful integration of recent computer-based training
company acquisitions." S&amp;P said National Education has so far
been unsuccessful in raising a minimum of $10 million in
additional capital required before May 1 by a bank credit
agreement. It said the company's "negative cash flow,
strained liquidity, and lack of additional borrowing capacity
reduce its ability to service debt."
