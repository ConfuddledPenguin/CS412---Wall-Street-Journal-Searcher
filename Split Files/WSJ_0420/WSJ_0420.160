   WASHINGTON -- Republican divisions over U.S. policy toward
Israel broke into the open in an unusual exchange of testy
letters between Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole and
younger conservatives in the House GOP leadership.
   In recent months, Mr. Dole has been increasingly outspoken
in challenging U.S. aid to Israel, and the tension yesterday
reflected a growing concern among Republicans that the
harshness of his tone is hurting the party going into the
fall elections. The Kansas senator said it was "bunk" for his
critics to paint him as "anti-Israel." But among his own
Jewish backers, his published comments during a recent trip
to the Mideast has provoked concern.

   "He's not only hurt himself, but he's hurt his party,"
said a past Jewish contributor to Mr. Dole. "I think his
remarks are mean-spirited."
   The flurry of letters yesterday pitted Mr. Dole most
directly against House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich. And the
conservative support for Israel reflects an alliance that
grew stronger under the Reagan administration. The 1988 GOP
platform was striking in its support of pro-Israel positions,
and even as the Bush administration and Secretary of State
James Baker have signaled a shift in policy, conservatives
have sought to build on ties to Jerusalem and Jewish
contributors at home.
   "We firmly support our party's platform," said Mr.
Gingrich in a letter signed by himself and three other
members of the House leadership. "For this reason, we take
issue with your statements on aid to Israel and the status of
Jerusalem."
   Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), who also signed the letter and
is expected to move soon into the House Republican campaign
structure, said, "Bush and Baker have taken a different
approach and that has caused some uneasiness. What Dole is
doing is far more destructive."
   While Mr. Dole has won praise for his willingness to
question the pro-Israel lobby, he has hurt himself by seeming
to reverse his positions from one month to the next. His
initial proposal to impose a 5% cut in foreign aid to Israel
and other major recipient countries appeared hastily
prepared, and came even as he was signaling support for new
aid to help build housing for Soviet Jews in Israel. He has
since moved away from a proposal to help finance such
housing. And after being among the first sponsors last month
of a pro-Israel resolution calling for a unified Jerusalem,
he now says the legislation is harmful to peace in the region
and his own support of it was a mistake.
   Mindful of the House criticism, Senate GOP Whip Alan
Simpson (R., Wyo.) rose last night to defend Mr. Dole, who
said in turn that he would match his record on Israel against
that of any other member of Congress. But the Kansas
Republican and former presidential hopeful is described as
resentful that he didn't receive more financial support from
Jewish contributors in the past. More recently, Mr. Dole was
angered when pro-Israel forces -- in alliance with the
Turkish lobby -- helped to undercut his efforts to win
passage of a resolution commemorating the Armenian massacres.
And he has portrayed the leadership of the pro-Israel lobby
as shortsighted and selfish.
   In January, when Mr. Dole first proposed redistributing
foreign aid, Mr. Gingrich praised him for showing "great
courage." As a postscript to his own letter, the senator
needled the Georgia conservative yesterday by reminding him
of his praise then. "Weren't those words for public
consumption?" asked Mr. Dole of Mr. Gingrich.
