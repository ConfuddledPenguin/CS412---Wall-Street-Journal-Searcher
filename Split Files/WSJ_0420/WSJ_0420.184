   ZURICH -- The sudden resignation of maverick banker Martin
Ebner from the board of the Zurich Stock Exchange has drawn
attention to a simmering dispute within the Swiss banking
community over the future of the country's financial center,
market observers say.
   Observers say privately that small banks and large banks
are increasingly taking opposing sides on key issues
affecting the Swiss financial community's future. And Mr.
Ebner's resignation is being viewed as a clear victory for
the big banks.

   "He is really a leader of the small banks," says one
banker familiar with the situation.
   Mr. Ebner, who is president of BZ Bank Zurich AG, wasn't
available for comment on his resignation. People close to the
situation, however, say he decided to quit when it became
apparent that he lacked the votes needed to shake up the
leadership of the stock exchange's board.
   "He had some opposition from the big banks, and he knew he
had no chance," says one banker.
   One key element of the dispute, several analysts say, is
Mr. Ebner's outspoken criticism of the Swiss stock market's
plans for an expensive electronic trading system. Large banks
are said to favor the idea, while some smaller banks are said
to oppose it as too expensive or even unnecessary.
   In addition, smaller, traditional private banking houses
face enormous costs in meeting the challenge of a
fast-changing global financial industry, and an electronic
trading system would use up resources that could be spent
elsewhere, analysts say.
   Such costs could eventually force some of the smaller,
family-owned Swiss banks to forge alliances with the major
players, CS Holding (Credit Suisse), Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., according to analysts.
   "The big banks have the power and financial muscle, and
the smaller ones don't have that," noted Albert Pauchard,
vice president for research at HandelsBank NatWest in Zurich.
   Analysts point to recent takeovers of smaller banks by
larger ones in Switzerland, including the proposed CS Holding
alliance with the much smaller Bank Leu AG. This trend toward
consolidation will continue as Swiss banks seek to prepare
for more competition from abroad.
   The electronic market, which is set to begin next year
with trading in straight bonds at first, has served as a
focal point in the debate over the Swiss banking community's
efforts to modernize as foreign challengers grow stronger.
   Mr. Ebner's role in opposing electronic trading carried
some clout largely because BZ Bank Zurich, a small, upstart
bank that pioneered covered options on Swiss shares, has
captured some 20% of the turnover on the Zurich Stock
Exchange, compared to about 15% each for Union Bank and
Credit Suisse, and about 12% for Swiss Bank Corp.
   Although numerous smaller banks that are members of the
exchange lined up on Mr. Ebner's side on the electronic
banking issue, the big banks prevailed in a narrow, 15-to-14
vote last autumn to approve the startup of electronic
trading. Plans to expand the system from bond trading to
stock trading, however, haven't been finalized, and the
debate has intensified.
   Richard Meier, chief executive officer of the Zurich Stock
Exchange, acknowledged that the debate over the electronic
market could have played a role in Mr. Ebner's decision to
quit the exchange's board. Although Mr. Meier says the stock
exchanges could afford to foot the start-up cost of 35
million Swiss francs ($23.5 million) for the system, he
conceded that there would be additional costs for the 28 ring
banks. Operating costs of the system will be about 4.5
million francs a year.
