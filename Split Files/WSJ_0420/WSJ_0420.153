   Hathaway Corp. said it asked the Internal Revenue Service
to rule on whether the spinoff of its computer software
operation would be tax-free.
   The Broomfield, Colo., maker of electronic systems said it
is considering spinning off the shares of the software
operation, to be known as Global Software Inc., to its
shareholders. The business includes Carolina Global Inc. and
its Global Software Inc. unit, which together account for
just under half of Hathaway's revenue.

   Hathaway said it will make a final decision about the
spinoff after it receives the IRS ruling and wins approval
from its lenders.
