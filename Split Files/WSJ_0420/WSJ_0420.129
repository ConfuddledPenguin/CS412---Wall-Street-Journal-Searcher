   NEW YORK -- Compared with its peers, Morgan Stanley
scarcely has the look of a modern, diversified investment
bank.
   It hasn't needed a capital infusion to stay afloat. It
hasn't laid off thousands, or even hundreds, of its
employees. And it hasn't taken a big write-down lately.

   What Morgan Stanley does have is a return that far
outstrips other publicly traded Wall Street firms, and,
indeed, outpaces the vast majority of American industry.
Since 1985, Morgan Stanley has earned an average return on
equity of 31%, and the figure has never been lower than 25%
in any year.
   This is hardly a secret. Morgan Stanley has been praised
high and low, especially as other Wall Street firms, such as
Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman Hutton, and the First Boston
unit of CS First Boston, have stumbled. Yet Morgan Stanley's
stock languishes at six times the company's 1989 earnings,
and at seven to eight times its estimated net income for
1990.
   "The stock is selling at a significant discount to
intrinsic value," the brokerage firm Dominick &amp; Dominick
says. "It is misperceived as another investment banker about
to suffer from the `end of the '80s.'"
   The relative case for Morgan Stanley is strong. Merrill
Lynch, which apparently is suffering from the end of
something, is trading at about 14 times estimated 1990
earnings. Merrill, as part of a continuing, massive
retrenchment, took a $470 million pretax charge in the fourth
quarter, and its basic business of retail brokerage is slow.
   Yet Merrill's stock, relative to Morgan Stanley's, is
twice as dear. Relative valuations, admittedly, are never
sure bets.
   But Morgan Stanley looks good on an absolute basis, as
well. Analysts say it is well-managed; it competes only in
carefully selected markets, and it has a diversified source
of revenue.
   Julian Robertson, president of Tiger Management and a
Morgan Stanley investor, has a somewhat pithier rationale. He
says Morgan Stanley's stock offers "the most brains for the
money that I know of."
   Dominick's Tony Russ views Morgan Stanley as having two
cash-generating businesses that require little capital:
investment banking and asset management. What distinguishes
Morgan Stanley, he says, is that it has profitably reinvested
its surplus cash into two businesses that do require capital:
trading for its own account, and merchant banking.
   Trading is, by definition, risky, but Morgan Stanley
monitors its operations closely. Its signature has been a
refusal to compete in products that don't provide at least a
25% return.
   "When returns fall, they pull capital away," Mr. Russ
says, "but unlike many others, Morgan has demonstrated it can
pull back from an underperforming business before it produces
serious losses." For example, it has reduced trading in its
own account in index arbitrage, municipal bonds and the
corporate IOUs known as commercial paper, he says.
   In merchant banking, Morgan Stanley has a $250 million
stake in a leveraged buy-out partnership that owns companies
such as Fort Howard Paper and Burlington Industries. This
contributes to earnings only sporadically, when assets are
sold or restructured. And analysts, in estimating earnings,
ignore the partnership.
   But the companies are generating surplus cash, reducing
debt and, in effect, increasing the value of Morgan Stanley's
investment. "This amounts to a hidden stream of cash flow,"
Dominick says.
   Morgan Stanley's investment banking business will suffer
this year, and perhaps for many years, as mergers and junk
bond underwritings fall industrywide. But Morgan Stanley's
strong presence in Europe is partly offsetting the business's
weakness in the U.S. And Morgan Stanley's low stock price and
high credit rating should provide investors with a margin of
comfort.
   Mr. Russ isn't enamored of Morgan Stanley's research,
which he views as a fount of "conventional wisdom." But long
term, Morgan Stanley has a franchise in U.S. investment
banking, and this business is hardly apt to disappear. Mr.
Russ predicts that as the era of the leveraged buy-out fades,
"relationship banking" will re-emerge as important to
clients, and Morgan Stanley will benefit. The firm's outlook
is enhanced, because its employees own 53% of the stock and
are in for the long pull, and because of the way Morgan
Stanley has grown -- in a word: sensibly. By contrast, Mr.
Russ says, "Virtually every other {public} firm on Wall
Street grew by buying somebody else's big producer and paying
him too much money."
