   Newport News Savings Bank, Newport News, Va., said it
signed a letter of intent to merge with United Financial
Banking Cos., a Vienna, Va.-based bank holding company,
through an exchange of shares.
   In the proposed transaction, the two financial
institutions would exchange stock on a book value-for-book
value basis, as of the last day of the month preceding the
effective date of consolidation. They hope to complete the
transaction by Dec. 31, subject to a definitive agreement, as
well as shareholder and regulatory approvals.

   The proposal also calls for two directors of Newport News
Savings Bank, Robert L. Freeman Jr. and Gary A. Suttle, to
become directors of United Financial. United Financial, with
its primary subsidiary, Business Bank, had total assets of
$78 million and equity of $13.2 million as of Dec. 31, 1989.
Newport News Savings Bank would become a second wholly owned
subsidiary.
