   SEOUL, South Korea -- U.S. trade officials said they were
encouraged after talks with Korean counterparts this week,
but they won't say if enough progress has been made to keep
Korea off a pending U.S. list of unfair trade partners.
   Korean news reports Thursday had claimed the U.S. agreed
to drop South Korea from the list of unfair traders if Seoul
joins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's government
procurement code. These are international rules that govern
government purchases of imported goods. But a U.S. official,
in Seoul for several days of trade talks, said that no such
promise had been made. She said that President Bush will make
that decision based on recommendations from various
government departments and agencies.

   The 1988 U.S. Trade Act requires the president to list by
April 30 each year those countries practicing unfair trade.
South Korea is the fourth largest supplier of goods to the
U.S. government, but doesn't have clear rules on buying
imported goods for government use. "While we were encouraged
by the information we heard," the Washington official said,
"no one piece of information will determine the outcome."
   Even acceptance of the GATT government procurement code
won't necessarily end disagreements on government purchases
of U.S. products. Japan was an early signatory to the code
and the U.S. still faces significant Japanese reluctance to
buy U.S. goods.
   The trade negotiators also discussed a host of other
issues, including implementation of prior agreements.
"Generally speaking, we are pleased with the way the
agreements are being implemented," said a U.S. official, who
asked not to be identified. "There are minor problems, but
that is always the case."
   The trade officials also are preparing final adjustments
to a trade agreement on U.S. beef imports into Korea. The
agreement was worked out in Washington last month and a U.S.
official said the agreement could be signed next week.
   The working-level officials also established an official
group to review technical regulations for food safety that
affect agricultural imports by both nations. There have been
numerous tiffs between the two countries on imported products
that may or may not have carried harmful pesticides.
Officials agreed to postpone discussions on
telecommunications disputes.
   The South Korean government also presented complaints to
the U.S., including its claims that American tobacco
companies market their products unfairly and that U.S.
regulations for imported fruit aren't clear.
