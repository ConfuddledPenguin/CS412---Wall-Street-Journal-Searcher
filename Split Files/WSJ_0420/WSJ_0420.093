   Environmental Protection Agency analyst E.G. Vallianatos,
writing in the Oct. 10 issue of the Chicago Tribune:

   {Will} corporations like Exxon . . . and the other
capitalists/industrialists of the world . . . begin
dismantling the machines that are heating the Earth? These
men and women control the world. They devour the rain forest;
they manufacture the cars that pump millions of tons of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; they own the coal, gas,
oil and factories of the world.
   To get away from all these wealth-creating "resources"
would be inconceivable, for what would the
capitalists/industrialists do? They have built a megamachine
on the very specifications of a greenhouse Earth. They
educate millions of young students in the wisdom of this
earth-heating, destructive, suicidal system.
   These same earth-heating technocrats have also been
telling the Third World that "development" means to do what
they did: Industrialize everything: force the peasants off
the land and create mechanical cash monocultures; sell trees,
bananas, coffee, vanilla, cacao, oil palm, beef and oil to
the "developed" North and with the money import TVs, luxury
goods like big cars, and machine guns to kill the peasant
guerrillas who cause trouble.
