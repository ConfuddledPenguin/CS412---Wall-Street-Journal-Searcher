   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. -- Par Pharmaceutical Inc. named Elie
G. Shami senior vice president for scientific affairs and
quality.
   Mr. Shami also was named to the board, filling a vacancy.

   Mr. Shami, who has a doctorate in physical pharmacy, has
held senior positions in pharmaceutical companies and most
recently was in research and development at Orlove Group, a
closely held Fort Lauderdale, Fla., generic-drug company. Mr.
Shami also will oversee quality and scientific affairs at
Par's Quad Pharmaceuticals unit. In late March, Quad halted
distribution of all products subject to federal approval.
   Par, a generic-drug concern under federal investigation,
also reiterated its commitment to the requirements of good
manufacturing practices and compliance with its approved
product applications. It issued a voluntary declaration
providing for comprehensive and continuous reviews of its
practices.
   In addition to the specific commitments outlined in the
declaration, Par said its president is required to certify to
the Food and Drug Administration that the company is in
substantial compliance with the declaration.
   The declaration is expected to facilitate Par's
reintroduction of products that remain under a voluntary
distribution moratorium Par imposed last August. Since then,
the company has reintroduced about 50% of its products, a
spokesman said.
