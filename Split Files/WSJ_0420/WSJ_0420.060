   Nissan Motor Co. has begun construction on a new vehicle
assembly plant in Mexico that is part of a $1 billion
expansion in that country.
   A U.S. spokesman for the Japanese auto maker said Nissan
is building the new plant in the state of Aguascalientes,
where it already has a plant that assembles engines and
transaxles and produces some stamped parts.

   He said capacity for the new assembly plant will be about
100,000 vehicles a year. That would double Nissan's vehicle
assembly capability in Mexico; the auto maker already builds
about 100,000 pickup trucks and Sentra subcompact cars a year
at an assembly plant near Mexico City.
   The U.S. spokesman said Nissan hasn't decided yet what
vehicles it will build at the Aguascalientes plant, which
should be completed by the end of 1993. It also hasn't
decided where, other than in Mexico, it will sell the
vehicles it builds there. About 20,000 of the cars and trucks
built at the plant near Mexico City are exported to Central
America and South America; the rest are sold in Mexico.
   A report yesterday from Japan quoted a company spokesman
there as saying the majority of the Aguascalientes vehicles
would be sold in Mexico, although a substantial amount will
be exported to Japan, Latin America and North America.
   Nissan expects to hire about 2,000 workers initially for
the Aguascalientes plant; the cost of training these workers
is included in the $1 billion investment figure.
   The investment also includes expanding the Aguascalientes
engine, transaxle and stamped parts plant. The U.S. spokesman
said he didn't have details on the expansion, but Nissan will
hire an additional 1,000 workers for the engine plant.
   The moves come as Nissan is expanding capacity in the U.S.
The auto maker already builds pickups and Sentras at a plant
in Smyrna, Tenn. By 1992, capacity at Smyrna will have been
boosted to 440,000 vehicles a year. Nissan's total investment
at Smyrna, which includes an engine-making operation, will
grow to $1.2 billion by 1992.
