   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to appeal a
Quebec Superior Court ruling that the Competition Tribunal,
which reviews antitrust cases, is unconstitutional.
   The appeal is to be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tribunal, which was established four years ago,
reviews cases referred to it by the government's antitrust
agency, the Bureau of Competition Policy.
   The tribunal's powers were challenged by Quebec City-based
Alex Couture Inc., a processor of animal waste products,
after the company was blocked from taking control of a
competitor.
   The Superior Court ruled that the tribunal, with members
including judges, economists and business specialists, had
powers that violate constitutional guarantees of fair and
impartial judicial proceedings.
