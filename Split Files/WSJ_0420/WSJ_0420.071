   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America said it collected
17.1 billion used aluminum beverage cans for recycling last
year, or about 68 cans for each American.
   Can collectors were paid $232 million by returning the
cans, which weighed 611 million pounds, to Alcoa's 2,400
recycling centers.

   The collected cans are remelted, rolled into new aluminum
can sheet and sold to can makers, Alcoa said.
   An estimated 10 million people in the U.S. recycle
aluminum cans regularly, the company said.
   Overall, Alcoa said 49 billion beverage cans last year
were recycled in the U.S., or 61% of the 80 billion aluminum
beverage cans that were produced. This is a record increase
from 1988, when 55% of 78 billion aluminum cans were
recycled, the company said.
