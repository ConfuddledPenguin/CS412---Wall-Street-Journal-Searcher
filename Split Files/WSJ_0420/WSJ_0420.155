   Jarvis is a newly formed hotel group headed by John
Jarvis, former Hilton International Co. chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Allied-Lyons said proceeds from the sale, made in line
with its plans to develop its core operations, will help
reduce the group's borrowings.
   Embassy operates 41 hotels with 3,150 bedrooms at major
business centers of the U.K.
