   The 15 stories in Susan Dodd's new collection, "Hell-Bent
Men and Their Cities" (Viking, 240 pages, $17.95),
demonstrate her accomplishment and versatility, while
providing the reader with the diverse kinds of satisfaction
that come from simple realism on the one hand and ironic
self-consciousness on the other. Author of two previous
novels ("No Earthly Notion" and "Mamaw") and one story
collection ("Old Wives' Tales"), Ms. Dodd tackles a
considerable range of styles and subjects without seeming to
strain for effect.
   Ms. Dodd's themes include Jewish-Gentile relationships,
the inevitable changes wrought by illness and old age, the
strains that weaken the bonds of family life, and the good
old mysterious power of love. In the title story, love
seduces a happily countrified woman from the peace and quiet
of her upstate life back to the hectic pace of the city. In
another story, "I'm Right Over There," love is a sedate and
scarcely spoken but no less strongly felt force in the life
of an older man who longs to comfort the unhappy young woman
next door.

   "You can feel things . . . without having to act on them,"
he reflects. "Maybe that's even an advantage to getting old.
. . . If you're married to a woman like Fran and you're of
sound mind, you don't jump the fence. But you can love other
women. You should, too. You should love anyone you've got it
in you to love, the way I see it."
   This low-keyed naturalism is very different from the
stylized irony of a story such as "Isometropia," in which a
mysterious voice speaking on behalf of his wife and his
mistress addresses the man who is object of their rivalry:
"And when your breathing becomes deep and even, when we've
got you where we want you, we dream of each other, dreams so
vivacious that you grow pale, extraneous."
   A few of the stories fall flat: some because they are
overly sentimental, others because they are too cool or too
contrived. But in most, the blend of sweetness and skepticism
is just about right.
   In contrast to Ms. Dodd's wide interests and settings, the
narrower range of regional fiction helps some writers achieve
focus, even though it also can become a limitation. Beverly
Coyle's engaging first novel, "The Kneeling Bus" (Ticknor &amp;
Fields, 184 pages, $18.95), is a self-evidently
autobiographical account of growing up the daughter of a
Methodist minister in rural Florida in the 1950s.
   Although Ms. Coyle knows how to capture the innocent
charms of childhood and a vanished, backwoods world in which
direct long-distance dialing is the latest thing, she does
not rely exclusively on country-style naivete for her comic
effects. Right from the start, she lets us know she is
dealing with something a little more complex: "There were no
religious pictures on the walls . . . my mother would not
hear of it. . . . my father was a liberal with advanced
degrees who'd smoked cigarettes in the Navy. And I was taken
to New York the summer I turned nine, where I saw Patty
McCormack burn up her red shoes in `The Bad Seed.'"
   The novel is composed of eight chapters, each one a
self-contained story, but arranged chronologically to achieve
a cumulative effect. Although not all the stories are equally
strong, the book does manage on the whole to succeed as a
novel. The characters -- who might so easily have been
portrayed as stereotyped lovable oddballs -- emerge as mildly
eccentric, entirely believable human beings. Nothing
genuinely bizarre or shocking ever happens in their world,
yet their lives are filled with the unexpected.
   There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of Southern
humor in contemporary fiction. Lee Smith's "Me and My Baby
View the Eclipse" (Putnam, 206 pages, $18.95) is a fair
sample of this regional vein. The nine stories in this
collection are less distinctive, more "generic" than those in
"The Kneeling Bus," but they still are full of the down-home
flavor of a culture in which the fervor of old-time religion
gets mixed up with the fever of sexual repression -- and
expression.
   It's a world of trusting, likable girls who "save
themselves" for marriage to their high school sweethearts:
("Cheryl had been so religious in high school, plus they all
wore panty girdles in those days," we're told of one). These
girls grow up to be easygoing, goodhearted wives and mothers
whose husbands walk out on them and the kids move in with
exotic, "liberated" types who live in apartment courts and
don't shave their legs. And even when it's the wife and
mother who does the cheating, you can't help liking her, as
in the case of Sharon, the large, pretty, "slow-moving"
heroine of the title story, who has an unlikely love affair
with Raymond, the goofily flamboyant, vaguely "artistic" son
of the town pharmacist.
   There's plenty of warmth, humor, absurdity and pathos in
these stories, although they share a tendency to become a
little too relentlessly perky and droll. A poverty-program
volunteer in town during the 1960s is described as someone
who "used to climb the mountains for fun, which nobody around
here has ever done. Or maybe he was just ahead of his time.
Now we have all this ecology and physical fitness but nobody
had it then."
