   BLUE BELL, Pa. -- Unisys Corp. said its first-quarter loss
narrowed sharply to $3.1 million from $78.7 million a year
earlier.
   After allowing for preferred dividends, the loss in the
latest period amounted to 19 cents a share, roughly in line
with expectations. The 1989 first-quarter loss was equal to
66 cents a share.

   Revenue rose 5% to $2.31 billion from $2.20 billion,
slightly above expectations, but analysts remained
noncommittal about the company's prospects.
   Unisys attributed much of the improvement to healthier
gross margins resulting from a scaling down last year that
trimmed the computer maker's work force by about 8,000 jobs.
Full benefits from those steps, which led to a $230-million
charge in the 1989 third quarter, will kick in during the
second half of this year, Unisys said. The company previously
estimated the cutbacks will save it about $500 million
annually.
   "Overall, we believe that we are on track to reach our
1990 goal of reducing debt, restoring sound profitability and
improving cash flow," James Unruh, president and chief
executive, said in a statement. A company spokesman said
Unisys, which has been criticized by analysts as too highly
leveraged, reduced its debt by between $50 million and $100
million during the period.
   Unisys said its international results were strong, but
that domestic business, long a disappointing performer,
"remains weak." The company has been buffeted by a price war
and strong competition in the U.S. mainframe computer market,
and analysts said its troubles in that area are likely to
continue.
   Unisys said its strongest gains were in networking
products, software, services, and computers using the Unix
operating system.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Unisys closed at $14.625, unchanged.
