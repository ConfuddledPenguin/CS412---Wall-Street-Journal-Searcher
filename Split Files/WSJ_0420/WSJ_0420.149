   The Stoughton, Mass., footwear concern said U.S. sales of
Reebok footwear grew about 2% during the current quarter.
   The company said sales increases at its Rockport and
Ellesse divisions and the addition of sales of its Boston
Whaler division, acquired last October, were "largely" offset
by a decrease in sales at its Avia unit.
   A company spokesman said sales for Avia were $48.2 million
in the latest quarter, down 26%, from $64.9 million in the
year-ago period.
   He said the Avia segment, under new management since last
year, "needed focusing" and has had to be "positioned to a
point from which it can grow." He declined to predict the
group's annual sales, which totaled $196.2 million last year.
   He said the unit is now concentrating on "pure atheletic"
shoes.
