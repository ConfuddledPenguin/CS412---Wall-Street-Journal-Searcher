   Tandy Corp. said its net income declined about 20% for the
third quarter ended March 31 as sales of consumer electronics
products and low-cost personal computers continued to be
sluggish.
   However, the Fort Worth, Texas-based electronics
manufacturer and retailer said that each month of the quarter
showed some improvement and that its Radio Shack stores open
more than a year recorded a 4% sales gain during the period.

   For the third quarter, Tandy said it had net income of $53
million, or 67 cents a share, compared to $66.7 million, or
75 cents a share, last year. Revenue rose 7.4% to $1.01
billion from $943.7 million last year. The company had about
79.6 million shares outstanding at March 31, reflecting a
10-million shares buy-back during calendar 1989.
   It was the second consecutive quarter that Tandy's
earnings per share had dropped below year-ago levels "and
hopefully the last," said a spokesman.
   The company said its introduction of more expensive
computer models and the growth of its cellular telephone
business were bright spots during the quarter.
