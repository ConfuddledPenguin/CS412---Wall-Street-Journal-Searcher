   In your March 22 article "Conflict Issues Cloud Financial
Planning," the role of "due diligence" is omitted. The most
crucial question a potential investor should be asking any
financial planner is, "Who performed the due diligence on the
product that is being recommended, and what were that
person's qualifications to do so?"
   Before committing to any investment, one should
"diligently" inquire as to the background, credentials, track
record, integrity, etc. of the syndicator, and not entirely
rely on one's investment adviser's recommendation until the
answers to these kinds of questions are answered
satisfactorily.

   Unfortunately for the client, fee-only planners bask in
the luxury of being able to shirk this responsibility
altogether.
