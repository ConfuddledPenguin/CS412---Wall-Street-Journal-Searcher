   SMOOTH SAILING: Bush rides a huge current of political
popularity.
   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that
registered voters approve of his job performance, 75% to 15%.
Aides say the lopsided result vindicates the president's
cautious, prudent approach. Fifty-nine percent approve of his
economic performance, his highest rating since September.

   Former Reagan aide Thomas Griscom says Bush's popularity,
ironically, may be working against him in some ways. He
blames "the general attitude of the country right now, one of
satisfaction," for the president's inability to generate a
groundswell of support on such issues as the capital gains
tax cut and the child-care bill.
   But Burton Pines of the conservative Heritage Foundation
says the president's many vetoes -- 10 in his first year, the
most since Eisenhower -- are "an exercise of presidential
popularity."
                                                                                                       

   LUCKY OR GOOD? Foreign tests may show which Bush is.
   As world events from Moscow to Pretoria to Managua have
broken his way, approval of his foreign-policy performance
has steadily risen in the Journal/NBC poll. It now stands at
70%, up from 58% seven months ago. Aides feel little pressure
to be more forceful in responding to world events.
   But tougher tests could lie ahead. An eruption in
Lithuania may yet alter public opinion and create pressure
for tougher steps than Bush is prepared to take. Aid for
Panama and Nicaragua is caught in a Capitol Hill morass, much
to Bush's embarrassment. He may also face struggles over
trade benefits to China, military aid to El Salvador and
imposing additional sanctions against South Africa.
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS KEEP the economy growing, as other sectors limp.
   Economists who had been fearful that consumers were
retrenching now figure spending is steady enough, when
combined with the improving trade picture, to push economic
growth above 2% in the first quarter. "Consumers have been
doing their part to hold the economy up," says retailing
economist Rosalind Wells. But some weakness persists,
especially in car sales.
   The Journal/NBC poll finds consumers slightly more
optimistic, a hopeful sign for the economy. Only 23% foresee
a recession in the next year. Some 42% expect the economy to
stay about as it is.
   The Blue Chip survey of economists says strong consumer
demand would be the most important favorable factor for
growth in 1991.
                                                                                                       

   ROSTENKOWSKI'S FORMULA for balancing the budget stirs
little enthusiasm, the poll finds. When asked about a package
that would cut defense, freeze most other programs --
including Social Security -- and increase taxes, 68% say they
are opposed; only 27% are in favor.
                                                                                                       

   NO NUKES: By 57% to 36%, voters oppose building more
nuclear power plants, concluding that risks of accident and
radiation leaks outweigh the reduction in air pollution over
coal- and oil-burning plants. Loosening limits on offshore
oil drilling is opposed by 54% and supported by 38%,
according to the poll.
                                                                                                       

   LIP READERS: Some 57% of voters believe Bush should stick
to his no-new-taxes position, according to the Journal/NBC
survey, while 39% think "there are some things for which he
should now support" higher taxes.
                                                                                                       

   FIGHTING DRUGS remains at the top of the national agenda,
the poll found in measuring the intensity of feeling on six
issues that voters consider vital. Crime, the environment and
education also elicit strong feeling; the budget deficit and
reducing health-care costs lag slightly behind.
                                                                                                       

   BUSH FAVORS gentle treatment of Japan in coming trade
decisions.
   He must decide by April 30 whether to designate as unfair
under U.S. trade law Japan's policies inhospitable to U.S.
semiconductors and auto parts. Baker, Brady, Darman and chief
economist Boskin argue that Prime Minister Kaifu has already
gone as far as he can in the recent agreements with the U.S.
Trade representative Hills, a strong backer of tough action
last year, takes a softer tone now.
   But Commerce chief Mosbacher argues for holding Kaifu's
feet to the fire, and the Journal/NBC poll gives him some
support: 52% believe Japan isn't sincere about opening its
markets, 34% think it is. About half say the recent agreement
will make "just some" difference; 34% think it will matter a
great deal or quite a bit, while 11% think it won't matter at
all.
   This week's agreement between the two nations to negotiate
Allied-Signal's trade complaint removes one difficult issue
of contention, at least for now.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Guess who's coming to dinner: Given the
choice, those surveyed would rather have dinner with Bush
than with Gorbachev, 73% to 19%. . . . Among the
ex-presidents, Reagan and Carter are virtually tied as the
guest of choice, at about a third each; only 14% chose Ford
and 13% Nixon. . . . Of those who say they cast ballots in
1988, only 32% own up to having voted for Dukakis; he
actually got 46% of the popular vote.
