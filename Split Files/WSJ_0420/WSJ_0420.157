   GlenFed Inc. said improved core earnings and a sharp cut
in operating costs pushed fiscal third-quarter profit up 30%
to $26.3 million, or 85 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or
68 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Separately, the nation's fifth-largest thrift, based in
Glendale, Calif., said it passed an important regulatory test
during the quarter when federal examiners, in a survey of its
asset-classification system, found that the company isn't
required to increase its loan-loss reserves. The company also
said it increased its tangible and risk-based capital to a
level that continues to exceed more-stringent capital
requirements imposed by the recent congressional thrift
reform act.

improved to 2.24% from 1.72% a year earlier.

$12.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
