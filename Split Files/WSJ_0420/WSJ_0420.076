   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission, determined
to refute U.S. charges that it is creating a "Fortress
Europe," accused the U.S. of maintaining numerous barriers to
European exports.
   In its annual review of "U.S. trade barriers and unfair
trade practices," the EC listed more than 50 impediments to
trade. Among the sectors singled out by Brussels were public
procurement and banking.

   The EC report has been expanded considerably from last
year and includes a wide range of trade practices running
from high U.S. tariffs on footwear to U.S. agricultural
export subsidies. More than a dozen items have been added
since the 1989 report, although commission officials said
only some of these were actually new practices introduced in
the past year.
   They said the longer list reflected the more thorough job
done by EC experts in identifying U.S. trade barriers.
   "We detect a tendency in the U.S. to think that in the
trade game, other countries play unfair while only the U.S.
plays fair . . . this simply isn't true," a commission trade
official said.
   He said the EC report was a response to the U.S. trade
representative's annual report on barriers to foreign trade,
which repeatedly has included EC trade practices. U.S.
officials had no immediate response to the EC document.
