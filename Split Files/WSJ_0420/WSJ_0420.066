   WASHINGTON -- After years of watching hostile takeovers,
the Securities and Exchange Commission is attempting one of
its own.
   Led by a politically savvy, well-connected chairman, the
agency is favored to succeed, a move that would usher in a
new age in how the financial markets are regulated.

   The takeover target is the politically vulnerable
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or at least its
fastest-growing operation, regulation of the
financial-futures markets. And the voters in this contest
aren't shareholders, but members of Congress.
   "I really think the pressure is for doing something," says
Slade Gorton (R., Wash.), a member of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which oversees the CFTC.
   Like many corporations preyed upon by raiders, the
woebegone Commodity Futures Trading Com- mission is casting
about for the right defensive strategy to pursue. "All of
this is proceeding very rapidly," laments CFTC member Fowler
West.
   Indeed, the CFTC suddenly finds itself with far less
support on Capitol Hill than it has had in the past. While
the CFTC tries to stand tough, its erstwhile backers in
Congress -- and their campaign contributors in the Chicago
futures markets -- are privately discussing compromise
solutions that could result in switching much of the CFTC's
jurisdiction to the SEC. That's a drastic turnabout from just
two years ago, when a proposal to transfer financial-futures
regulation to the SEC was fiercely opposed by the Chicago
markets.
   Now the positions are reversed: With the Chicago exchanges
weakened by scandal, the CFTC looks ripe for a takeover. And
the SEC holds a far stronger hand than it did in the past.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden argues that jurisdiction over
the two markets needs to be unified in order to crack down on
fraud and to have the U.S. speak with a stronger regulatory
voice internationally. Most importantly, he has the backing
of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and his right-hand man,
Robert Glauber. "We don't need more regulation,"
Undersecretary Glauber told senators recently. "But we do
need to move toward more unified regulation."
   The Bush administration's backing was the signal for which
many in Congress were waiting. "I don't think we can
underestimate the power of Brady in forging ahead with a
merger," says Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the
House finance subcommittee, and a longtime critic of the
split between regulation of the stock markets by the SEC and
the regulation of stock futures by the CFTC.
   Much more than in the past, Congress seems ready to move.
After years of steadfastly blocking change, members of the
two agriculture committees, which oversee the futures
markets, suddenly are trying to meet the SEC halfway. That's
partly because they are worried about being blamed for
another crash in the markets, and partly because they are
beginning to believe that a change in jurisdiction is
inevitable, and they want to cut the best deal possible.
   Sen. Gorton is proposing to shift oversight of financial
futures to the SEC from CFTC, leaving the futures regulator
to oversee the trading of traditional commodities, such as
wheat, soybeans, and pork bellies. On the House side, Reps.
Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Dennis Eckart (D., Ohio) have
gone a step further, offering to merge the two agencies into
an overarching superagency. Securities committees in both
houses have started holding hearings on the issue.
   Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, who has been silent on the issue, this
week asked Treasury Secretary Brady to submit proposals by
May 4. While the Michigan Democrat didn't offer an opinion in
his letter, he has in the past likened stock-index futures to
"cockroaches." A Treasury official said the administration
will respond with a proposal "built around the option of
moving index futures over to the SEC. This is a problem that
won't go away until it gets resolved."
   Still, hostile takeovers are never done deals until
completed, and this isn't any exception. Congress can be
exceedingly slow to move, and the futures markets have yet to
fire all their shots. "The futures industry folks are a lot
more organized than the securities side," says Bradley Belt,
a Republican aide to the Senate Banking Committee.
   Adds SEC member Mary Schapiro: "It may not go anywhere
this year. If nothing happens this year, I don't know what
kind of momentum there will be next year. If you're changing
the status quo you need a lot of momentum."
   But backers of the SEC's bid claim that momentum is with
them. They point to last October's stock-market plunge, which
showed investors and regulators that the historic October
1987 crash wasn't an isolated incident. Even usually stoic
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, told senators last
month that he was "shaken" by the second drop. Moreover, last
year the two largest exchanges regulated by the CFTC were
rocked by 48 indictments stemming from an undercover federal
investigation of widespread trading fraud. That led CFTC
critics to wonder just what the watchdog was watching.
   Additional pressure is coming from Wall Street, where the
securities industry is in the throes of a depression.
Investment in stocks has dwindled in recent years, and
volatility allegedly caused by the futures markets is
increasingly being blamed.
   The dispute sounds technical, but a lot rides on it. It
centers on commodity products called stock-index futures.
Used mostly by institutional investors to control risk, index
futures allow investors to bet on the direction of a group of
stocks without buying or selling the actual shares. Index
futures correlate directly to stocks traded in New York, but
are traded on the Chicago futures exchanges.
   What makes them controversial is that they are used in
program trading-strategies that use computers to trade a
blizzard of stocks and futures. Program trading has been
blamed for accelerating both stock-market crashes. Because
the cost of buying a basket of stocks through futures is
cheaper than through stocks, critics of futures contend that
the products create unusual gyrations in the stock market.
   That argument infuriates CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, who
contends that economic studies never have proved a link
between futures and volatility. Moreover, she believes that
removing index futures from the CFTC's purview would deeply
weaken an agency that would still be charged with overseeing
agricultural products. (Her views are echoed by her husband,
GOP Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who sits on the Senate Banking
Committee, which oversees the SEC.)
   "No problems have been identified that would be fixed by
shifting jurisdiction," Mrs. Gramm argues.
   Still, compromise talks are under way, though not between
the two agencies, where the relationship is cooling. The
discussions on Capitol Hill focus on raising the cost of
buying the futures contracts, bringing those costs closer to
where they are in the stock market. Other, more technical
changes also are being offered to the SEC's backers.
   But many on Capitol Hill don't see the issue dissolving
even if a compromise is reached. "When the opportunity
presents itself, there are individuals who want to take
advantage of it from a political standpoint," says Rep. Glenn
English, head of the House subcommittee that oversees the
CFTC. "The reasons may change from time to time but it's the
same old tune.
   "This," the Oklahoma Democrat concludes, "is simply a
question of turf, simply power."
