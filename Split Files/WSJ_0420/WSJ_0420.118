   ATLANTA -- Mortality rates linked to cervical cancer are
twice as high among black women as among whites, according to
new statistics published by the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   The study, which examines data from 1980 to 1987, shows
that, while mortality rates declined for both groups over the
period, black women were still twice as likely to succumb to
the cancer. In 1987, an average of 7.6 deaths occurred among
every 100,000 black women, while 2.9 deaths occurred among
every 100,000 white women.

   The mortality rates varied widely by race and state. For
whites, the rates ranged from 1.8 per 100,000 in Utah to 5.2
per 100,000 in West Virginia. For black women, rates ranged
from 5.7 per 100,000 in Washington State to 11.5 per 100,000
in Delaware and Nevada.
   The study noted that services for early detection of
cervical cancer -- particularly the Pap smear test -- have
substantially reduced mortality rates in recent decades. But
researchers added that black women still remain more
vulnerable to the illness because of, among other factors,
disparities in medical treatment after being screened for
cervical cancer.
