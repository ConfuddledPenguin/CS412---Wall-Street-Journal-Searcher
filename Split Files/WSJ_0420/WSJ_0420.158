   In the 1989 first quarter, Textron had net income of $63.3
million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $1.83 billion.
   B.F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer of the
aerospace, commercial products and financial services
concern, said, "Textron's balanced diversity has enabled us
to achieve a good start on the year, despite softness in
several of our markets."
   Mr. Dolan said continued strength in the company's finance
and insurance businesses "more than offset" the current
slowdown in its automotive divisions.
   Total revenue in Textron's Aerospace Technology sector,
its largest business segment, rose about 2% to $825.9
million; while revenue in the financial services sector rose
13% to $586.9 million. Revenue in the commercial products
sector, however, dropped 5% to $470.6 million.
