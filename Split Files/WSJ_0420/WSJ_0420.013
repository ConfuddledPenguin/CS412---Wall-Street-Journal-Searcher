   NEW YORK -- Even Wall Street's most tightfisted securities
firms can't completely shake off the sluggish markets these
days.
   Bear Stearns Cos., renowned for keeping a close eye on
costs, posted a 13% drop in net income for the fiscal third
quarter ended March 30.

   Net fell to $34.7 million, or 34 cents a share, from $41.1
million, or an adjusted 39 cents a share, a year earlier.
Per-share results are adjusted for a 5% stock dividend
declared yesterday, to be distributed May 31 along with the
regular quarterly cash payout of 14 cents a share.
   The brokerage and investment-banking firm had quarterly
declines of 19% in investment-banking revenue and 15% in
commission revenue compared with the year-earlier quarter.
The weakness in these areas more than offset strong
performances in mortgage-backed securities and corporate
bonds.
   James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.,
said, "It's a typical Bear Stearns quarter -- they're making
respectable money in tough times."
   Bear Stearns's performance falls in the middle of the pack
of earnings reported by Wall Street securities firms. A few
firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and PaineWebber Group
Inc., have managed modest profit gains compared with weak
year-earlier quarters; Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.
posted the biggest quarterly loss ever for a securities firm.
   Bear Stearns's results would have been more depressed if
it hadn't kept a tight lid on costs. The firm has been able
to keep nonpayroll expenses steady for several quarters. As a
result, says Diana Keat of Lipper Analytical Securities
Corp., "In good times, this is a firm that can really take
off."
   Revenue for the quarter fell 6%, to $587.6 million, from
$623.6 million.
   For the nine months, net income plunged 31% to $85.8
million, or 82 cents a share, from $124.8 million, or $1.16 a
share, for the year-earlier period. Revenue for the nine
months was about flat, at $1.7 billion.
   Slowing takeover activity has crimped one of Bear
Stearns's bread-and-butter businesses: risk arbitrage, or the
trading of takeover stocks. Alan C. Greenberg, chairman and
chief executive officer, acknowledged the problems in the
risk-arbitrage business but said: "If you're agile enough,
you'll still do all right with it."
