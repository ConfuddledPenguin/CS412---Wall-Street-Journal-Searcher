   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev increased the
economic and political pressure on Lithuania by sharply
reducing deliveries of natural gas to the renegade republic
and offering new concessions to its Baltic neighbor, Latvia.
   Following Wednesday's cutoff of oil, Soviet authorities
slashed deliveries of gas to Lithuania about 80% yesterday,
leaving barely enough flowing to enable people to heat their
homes and cook. The republic's own main source of power, the
Ignalina nuclear power plant, has meanwhile been shut for
"repairs."

   Lithuanian leaders set up a commission to oversee
rationing, and warned people to expect a "starvation diet."
Government spokesman Ceslovas Jursenas issued an appeal on
the republic's radio urging Lithuanians "to use most
thriftily these resources that we have, in industry, in
agriculture and in everday life." But the republic so far is
showing no sign of backing away from its March 11 declaration
of independence, which sparked the current crisis.
   In the first official statement, read on the main evening
television news, the Kremlin said it imposed the economic
sanctions because Lithuania had failed to give a
"constructive response" to Moscow's demands. Mr. Gorbachev
and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov said a week ago that an
embargo would be imposed unless Lithuania rescinded laws
passed since the independence declaration that violate the
Soviet Constitution.
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman sharply criticized
what he described as "a mounting propaganda campaign" in the
U.S. over developments in Lithuania. The spokesman, Vadim
Perfilyev, said the U.S. reaction, "can no longer be
explained by a natural desire to understand complicated
processes under way in another country." But he stressed he
was talking about media and other reaction, and wasn't
referring to the Bush administration.
   But Mr. Bush and the Western allies continued to avoid
retaliatory sanctions on Moscow over its crackdown in
Lithuania. The president said yesterday that sanctions
wouldn't be imposed without extensive consultations with the
allies.
   His "reluctance," the president said at a news conference
with French President Francois Mitterrand in Florida, "stems
from trying to keep open a dialogue and discussion that
affects many, many countries. And I am talking about arms
control. I am talking about solidifying the democracies in
Eastern Europe. I am talking about a lot of matters where
U.S.-Soviet relations affect a lot of other countries."
   Mr. Bush and the U.S. allies seemed eager to avoid any
action that would affect Soviet cooperation on arms
reduction, a new security arrangement for Eastern Europe, and
German reunification. The first priority, said a military
specialist at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is to
avoid causing new troubles for a beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev.
"There's a surprising degree of consensus on this," the
diplomat said.
   Lithuania's economy is likely to feel the effects of the
embargo very soon. The country's gas supply has been reduced
to 3.5 million cubic meters a day, less than one-quarter of
usual consumption. And Lithuania's big Mazeikiai oil refinery
has already been forced to work at considerably reduced
capacity. The Ministry of Chemical and Oil-Processing
Industry in Moscow said the refinery now has barely enough
stocks to continue functioning for four to five days more.
   Lithuanian officials had contended that a shutdown of the
refinery would punish others by halting supplies of crucial
petroleum products from Mazeikiai to other Baltic states and
some East European nations. But Moscow's State Committee for
Material and Technical Supplies said that neighboring
republics and foreign countries won't be hurt because they
will receive supplies from refineries in Russia, Byelorussia
and the Ukraine that have additional capacity.
   Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, spent
the day in Norway, holding exploratory talks with officials
about receiving other sources of oil. She will also visit
Denmark. So far, however, she appears to have received only a
lukewarm reception.
   As he steps up the economic pressure, Mr. Gorbachev is
also making strenuous new political efforts to persuade its
two Baltic neighbors not to follow Lithuania's lead.
   At a one-hour meeting in the Kremlin yesterday, the Soviet
president surprised Latvian leaders by offering the republic
a "special status" within the U.S.S.R. if it agreed not to
set out on the path of independence. Unlike Lithuania and
Estonia, the republic hasn't yet declared its independence,
although the issue will be discussed when the parliament
meets next month.
   Latvian officials said Mr. Gorbachev didn't give precise
details, but he hinted that the republic could become a type
of special economic zone. He offered to start talks on both
political and economic issues and, for the first time, raised
the important question of the republic's legal status.
   Along with Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia was forcibly
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 following a secret
agreement between Hitler and Stalin that the U.S.S.R.
parliament has now deemed illegal. The issue is important for
activists in all three Baltic republics, who say that they
aren't seeking to secede from the U.S.S.R., but merely to
regain the former independence that Moscow illegally took
away.
   Following his meeting with the Latvians, Mr. Gorbachev
also held two hours of talks with Estonian leaders. He again
warned them to rescind "anti-constitutional acts" taken by
the Estonian parliament, which has proclaimed its aim of
independence after an interim period and suspended the
U.S.S.R. Constitution on its territory.
   An Estonian news service quoted the republic's president,
Arnold Ruutel, as saying, "We need calm reasoning" and that
the republic's parliament should decide on what to do next.
