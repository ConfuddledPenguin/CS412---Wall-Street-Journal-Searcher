   WASHINGTON -- Disparities in economic growth among
different parts of the country narrowed last year as the New
England economy slowed and the Rocky Mountain and
Southwestern economies accelerated, new Commerce Department
figures show.
   After narrowing for 40 years, regional differences in
per-capita income widened significantly in the 1980s. But the
new figures support the predictions of some economists that
the last decade saw powerful but transitory economic shocks
rather than a reversal of the long-running trend.

   Per-capita personal income grew by 6.6% in New England
last year, a tad better than the 6.5% national average but
far slower than the 8% growth to which the region had become
accustomed in recent years.
   Because New England's economy grew so much faster than
that of the rest of the country earlier in the 1980s,
however, that six-state region remains the richest part of
the U.S. with income of $21,509 per person, more than 20%
above the national average of $17,567.
   Personal income includes wages, earnings of the
self-employed, rent, interest and dividends. It isn't
adjusted for taxes, inflation or differences in living costs
among regions.
   Earnings increases in New England's manufacturing and
service industries last year were the smallest since 1975,
the Commerce Department said, and construction earnings
declined for the first time since that year.
   In contrast, economic growth accelerated in the five Rocky
Mountain states for the third consecutive year. Per-capita
income grew 6.7% in 1989, up from 5.4% in 1988 and 4% in
1987. The region still lags much of the country, with
per-capita income of $15,316.
   Earnings in service industries in the Rocky Mountain
states grew faster than the national average for the first
time since 1982. Construction earnings picked up after three
years of declines. Farm income also rose. Only in Wyoming did
the growth in per-capita income slip below the 1988 rate.
   In the four-state Southwest region that includes Texas,
per-capita income grew by 6.1%, outstripping the 5.4% growth
in 1988 and 3% in 1987. But at $15,231, the region's
per-capita income was below that of every other section of
the country.
   The Southeast has the poorest states, but the region's
average is lifted by the prosperity of Virginia and Florida.
Mississippi had the lowest per-capita personal income last
year at $11,835. Connecticut had the highest at $24,604.

   Disparities in regional income levels narrowed because of
last year's growth.
