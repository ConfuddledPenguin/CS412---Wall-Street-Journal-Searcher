   LITHUANIA URGED energy conservation as Moscow slashed gas
supplies.
   Soviet leader Gorbachev increased pressure on the Baltic
republic by reducing deliveries of natural gas by about 80%.
The move followed Wednesday's cutoff of oil. The Kremlin said
it imposed the sanctions because Lithuania failed to give a
"constructive response" to demands to rescind
independence-related laws. Officials in Vilnius called on
Lithuanians to use energy supplies "most thriftily." In
Moscow, Gorbachev offered Latvia "special status" within the
Soviet Union if it refrained from secessionist moves.

   ISLAMIC MILITANTS DELAYED the expected release of an
American hostage.
   In a statement delivered in Beirut, the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine indefinitely
postponed the release of a captive because the U.S. failed to
meet a demand to send a senior State Department official to
Syria. The group had said Wednesday that it would free a
hostage by today. The latest statement was accompanied by a
photograph of Robert Polhill, one of three U.S. educators
held by the Shiite Moslem group since January 1987.
   Bush, who sent a hostage reception team to West Germany,
said the U.S. "doesn't knuckle under to demands," and wasn't
negotiating the release.
