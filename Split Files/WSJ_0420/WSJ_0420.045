   Scientists reported two laboratory advances against AIDS.
   Boston researchers described experiments hinting that a
Miles Inc. drug used in stroke patients might prevent the
brain and nerve damage seen in many AIDS patients. Miles is a
U.S. subsidiary of Bayer AG, the West German drug and
chemical maker.

   Meantime, British scientists, including a team from F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co., said they had synthesized a series
of chemicals that might stop the reproduction of the AIDS
virus. The feat throws the big Swiss drug maker into a race
with Merck &amp; Co., Upjohn Co., SmithKline Beecham PLC, Abbott
Laboratories and Monsanto Co. to develop a new class of
anti-AIDS drugs known as proteinase inhibitors.
   Reports of both developments appear in this week's issue
of the journal, Science.
   The Boston report focuses on a Miles drug, nimodipine,
sold under the brand name Nimotop. It belongs to a class of
drugs known as calcium channel blockers sold by a number of
drug makers. Unlike most of the other calcium channel
blockers, which are prescribed for heart patients, nimodipine
can permeate into the brain and therefore is used to prevent
brain-damaging artery spasms that afflict patients who have
suffered strokes from ruptured blood vessels.
   A team of neurological researchers at Children's Hospital
described a series of test-tube experiments aimed at finding
out how a protein on the surface of the AIDS virus damages
nerve cells. Such nerve damage is thought to underlie the
dementia that afflicts about two-thirds of AIDS patients.
   In the experiments, using rat nerve cells, they discovered
the virus protein, called gp120, causes the amount of calcium
in the nerve cells to skyrocket to as much as 33 times normal
levels. They suggested this calcium buildup is how the virus
protein damages nerve cells.
   At least some of the excess calcium flowed into the cells
from the outside through a special calcium channel in the
cell membrane. When the nerve cells were first incubated in
nimodipine, which blocks the calcium channel, the virus
protein no longer induced a calcium buildup in the cell,
neurologist Stuart A. Lipton and his colleagues reported.
   The researchers said their theory that the virus-induced
buildup of calcium causes nerve damage in AIDS patients is
unproven. But the experiments suggest further research should
be done aimed at eventually testing nimodipine in AIDS
patients. A spokesman for the Miles Pharmaceutical division
in West Haven, Conn., said the company has offered to fund
some preclinical studies at Children's Hospital but added it
was premature to think about clinical trials.
   The British scientists, led by chemists from Roche
Products Ltd. at Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire reported
synthesizing more than a dozen chemicals that block the
action of an enzyme that the AIDS virus uses to reproduce
itself after it has infected a white blood cell.
   A race to develop inhibitors of the enzyme, called a
proteinase, was touched off two years ago when scientists,
including those at Merck, uncovered the molecular structure
of the enzyme. This enabled chemists to begin designing
molecules that could block the enzyme's action.
   The British researchers said that in the test tube their
new proteinase inhibitors were "of considerably enhanced
potency" and appeared to be less toxic than other reported
inhibitors.
