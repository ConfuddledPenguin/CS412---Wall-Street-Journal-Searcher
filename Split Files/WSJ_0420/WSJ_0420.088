   HEPBURN: Publisher Alfred A. Knopf, part of Random House
Inc., acquired the world rights to Katharine Hepburn's
memoirs; the price wasn't disclosed. The book, tentatively
titled "Me," is expected out in hardcover next year. The
actress in 1987 wrote a best seller on making "The African
Queen," also published by Knopf. Random House's Ballantine
Books will publish a paperback version a year later.
