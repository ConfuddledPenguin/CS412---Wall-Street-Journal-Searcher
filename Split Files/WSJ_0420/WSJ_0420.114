   Peru is playing out a tragedy of Greek proportions. The
political drama reaches well beyond Alberto Fujimori, the
surprise spoiler who has scrupulously avoided revealing any
specific answers to the nation's economic crisis but is now
favored to win the presidential runoff against
novelist-turned-candidate Mario Vargas Llosa.
   The actual key antagonists are well known to the readers
of these pages. In addition to Mr. Vargas Llosa, there is the
Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, author of the
free-enterprise classic, "The Other Path." The story of their
fruitful association and tragic breakup helps explain why a
candidacy that seemed ensured has become a long shot.

   Before their collaborative efforts, the two men followed
remarkably similar quests. Both achieved success outside
Latin America but were not content to rest on their laurels.
They were driven by a desire to remedy Latin America's social
and economic inequities. Their quest for answers drew them
first to the socialist camp. But while the status quo was
unacceptable to them, the socialist alternative turned out to
be worse; one socialist experiment after another degenerated
into repressive regimes.
   The two men were forced by their convictions to renounce
their old leftist philosophy and politics at a time when to
do so meant social, if not professional, suicide. Many
friends were lost in the process.
   Both men continued their investigations in their own ways.
Through the characters in his novels and in his political
essays, Mr. Vargas Llosa examined the political and emotional
dimensions of the totalitarian temptation. Mr. de Soto was
busy documenting the social and economic consequences of
statist control. His pathbreaking research culminated in his
book on the underground economy, "El Otro Sendero." Mr. de
Soto's conclusions -- emphasizing the need to create clear
property rights and eliminate statist favoritism -- appealed
greatly to Mr. Vargas Llosa, who publically endorsed Mr. de
Soto's work.
   The two men joined forces in the early 1980s to set up the
Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD). It seemed like a
libertarian's match made in heaven: The consummate technician
drew up the plans for deregulation, and the internationally
recognized artist used his aura and poetic appeal to sell the
agenda. Just the kind of union that would terrify a statist
politician.
   Enter the drama's final antagonist: President Alan Garcia.
   In 1987 President Garcia attempted a desperate maneuver to
enrich the state's reserves, depleted by years of deficit
spending: He attempted to nationalize the banks. The
president had no reason to believe that anyone except a few
wealthy bankers and businessmen would put up a fuss to the
nationalization scheme. He was soon to regret his ignorance.
   Shortly after President Garcia announced his plans to
nationalize the banks, Mr. de Soto and the ILD got busy
campaigning against it. Through their network of underground
workers, they organized local meetings and a huge rally in
Lima on Aug. 21 to protest the nationalization effort. The
mass rally was an enormous success, drawing as many as
100,000. Despite Mr. de Soto's efforts at setting up the
rally, the star was Mr. Vargas Llosa.
   The public rallied around the issue. President Garcia was
forced to drop his nationalization plan. And a new political
star was born. President Garcia was humiliated and vowed
revenge. He did not have to wait long for his opportunity.
   Shortly after the successful 1987 rally, Mr. de Soto and
Mr. Vargas Llosa began to disagree about political
directions. Mr. de Soto was skeptical about joining forces
with the established, conservative politicos, realizing that
their protected interests rarely coincided with the concept
of a truly competitive market. Mr. Vargas Llosa felt that,
after all, established business interests had less to fear
from losing some of their favors than from losing everything
through a socialist administration. Besides, their political
and financial infrastructure was necessary for a successful
presidential bid.
   Mr. de Soto began publically criticizing Mr. Vargas Llosa.
"He's surrounding himself with all the people he doesn't need
. . . the traditional right . . . the old cronies," Mr. de
Soto told the Christian Science Monitor in April 1988. Still
Mr. Vargas Llosa continued to support Mr. de Soto's work,
writing a glowing forward to the 1988 English edition of "The
Other Path." But the rift grew wider.
   President Garcia saw his chance. Forbidden to run for a
second consecutive term, he was anxious to continue leading
his party, APRA, until 1995 when he will be eligible to run
again. But he had an image problem. If he could change his
negative image as a statist and dislodge the Vargas Llosa
phenomenon, he'd be killing two birds with one stone.
   The easiest way to do the latter was to cut off Mr. Vargas
Llosa's ties with the downtrodden and marry him, in the mind
of the public, with the established political elitists who
now supported him. To do the former would mean shaking hands
with an enemy, but President Garcia invited Mr. de Soto to
work for his government.
   The opportunity to put his theories to the test proved
irresistible to Mr. de Soto, who began a joint project with
the government of Peru to deregulate the economy and
guarantee property rights for the poor. Mr. Vargas Llosa was
reportedly furious. While avoiding public criticisms of Mr.
de Soto, he and his supporters told friends and associates
that Mr. de Soto was being used by President Garcia.
   Mr. de Soto, meanwhile, justified his work with President
Garcia by saying that laws must be changed before any one
leader could change the system. In fact, before the election,
the ILD issued an ad that pictured four leading candidates
(including Mr. Vargas Llosa but excluding Mr. Fujimori) above
which was the headline: "How can we avoid having one of them
as our next dictator?"
   Mr. Fujimori, who got 29% of the first-round ballots
against Mr. Vargas Llosa's 31%, is favored to win the June
runoff with the support of APRA and other leftist parties. It
may well be that he is enough of a political opportunist both
to accept the support of the left and adopt a free-market
platform. However, opportunists who embrace free-market ideas
out of political necessity very often lack the guts needed to
stick with a true free-market program.
   As former Chilean Finance Minister Hernan Buchi said last
November in this space, it's easy to start the process of
dismantling a statist economy, but "to maintain these changes
{in the face of constant pressure from special-interest
groups} takes a daily recommitment to the open-market
philosophy." Mario Vargas Llosa did not become an advocate
for the free market through political opportunism but through
a deeply philosophical understanding of its value.
   If, as has been reported, Mr. Fujimori relied on a network
of evangelical Christians to do his campaigning, Mr. de
Soto's network of underground workers could yet be galvinized
to come out and support the man who, with Mr. de Soto, has
championed their cause for so long. Will it happen? Greek
tragedies aren't known for their happy endings.
