   ATLANTA -- Big changes are bubbling at Coca-Cola USA,
moves that are likely to shake up the company's marketing
efforts and ripple through the soft-drink industry.
   According to soft-drink industry executives familiar with
Coca-Cola Co.'s domestic division, in the past few weeks the
company has:

   -- Chosen Theodore J. Host, president of Boyle-Midway
Household Products Inc., as its senior marketing executive,
filling a two-year vacancy in one of the most coveted
marketing jobs around;
   -- Expanded the consulting role of Sergio Zyman, an
ex-marketing executive at Coke who left under a cloud after
the New Coke fiasco and whose abrasive style won him the
title "the Aya-Cola";
   -- Decided to dim the spotlight on celebrity commercials,
which both Coke and Pepsi have relied on extensively in
recent campaigns.
   The changes, say the sources, don't reflect any massive
problems with Coke's domestic promotions or advertising.
Rather, they signal an attempt to revive some campaigns that
have been slipping into mediocrity.
   The company's latest Diet Coke campaign, for example,
featured little more than a parade of actresses and athletes
who bad-mouthed Pepsi -- not an effort that stacks up against
the company's successful jingles and sentimental ads of the
past.
   The most significant move is the appointment of Mr. Host,
who is expected to join the company early next month.
American Home Products Corp. agreed last month to sell its
Boyle-Midway division for $1.25 billion to Reckitt &amp; Colman
PLC, a London consumer products maker. Boyle-Midway brands
include Woolite, Black Flag and Easy Off. Mr. Host was also
an executive with American Home's food division, which makes
Chef Boyardee, among other things.
   The choice of Mr. Host was a surprise to industry
executives. Mr. Host didn't return repeated phone calls. Coke
would neither confirm nor deny the appointment.
   A Coca-Cola spokesman denied that there has been any
change in the company's plans for celebrity endorsements.
"The use of celebrities is still a viable part of the
marketing mix," he said. And regarding Mr. Zyman's role, the
spokesman said it would be "inappropriate to characterize his
work as more involved."
   The appointment of Mr. Host could be the most significant
in years for Coca-Cola USA. Mr. Host might be groomed to
succeed Ira C. Herbert, the 62-year-old president of
Coca-Cola USA, industry observers believe. But others note
that there is stiff competition for the position on the
inside.
   In the U.S., Mr. Herbert is Mr. Coke. Long before he
assumed the top job at the soft-drink giant's domestic unit
in October 1988, he helped pioneer the first national
television soft-drink commercials and devise memorable
advertising campaigns such as "It's the Real Thing," and "I'd
Like to Buy the World a Coke."
   In some advertising circles, Mr. Herbert is described as
Coke's "keeper of the trademark." The sometimes
quick-tempered executive personally approves every commercial
and ad theme. He has even checked the placement and size of
the Coca-Cola logo on grocery store coupons.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Host would eventually be
expected to fill both roles, president and senior marketing
executive, as Mr. Herbert has. Some in the industry speculate
that, if Mr. Host succeeds Mr. Herbert as president in a
couple of years, Michael Beindorff, the 38-year-old vice
president and director of marketing planning, could then
become Coke's senior marketing executive.
   Mr. Beindorff has been a shining star at Coke. He is
credited with the unusually aggressive "Move is on" Diet Coke
campaign, begun last year, which for the first time
positioned a diet soda against a sugared one, namely Pepsi.
He also was a force behind the much ballyhooed
three-dimensional TV spot that kicked off the Diet Coke
campaign.
   Although going outside for such a visible, senior post is
unusual for Coke, it is clear the company has been studying
outsiders for some time. About two years ago, Coke courted
Mark Goldston, then the president of Faberge Inc.'s Faberge
U.S.A. division. But Mr. Goldston ended up taking a marketing
job at Reebok International Ltd., a post he has since left.
   Coke was in no hurry to fill the job. Mr. Herbert, a
marketing heavyweight in his own right, hardly needed to be
propped up by a skilled underling. The last person to hold
the position of senior vice president for marketing was John
C. Reid, who moved into a planning post in 1988 following a
corporate reorganization. Mr. Reid has since taken a job with
Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson.
   Mr. Reid's tenure was fairly smooth compared with the
turbulent regime of his predecessor, Mr. Zyman, who helped
engineer the introduction of New Coke five years ago. When
Mr. Zyman left Coke in 1986, some people believed he was
forced out (although he and Coke then denied it) because his
abrasive style irritated Coca-Cola bottlers. Speculation
lingers that he was in some way a fall guy for New Coke. Mr.
Zyman was one of a small group of Coca-Cola executives
involved with New Coke.
   Still, Mr. Zyman, now a consultant, has done advisory work
for Coke in recent years with Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the
big Coca-Cola bottling unit, and Coke's fountain division,
whose business has been listing lately because of softness in
the fast-food industry. Mr. Zyman has a reputation as a tough
but brilliant marketer. Mr. Zyman didn't return calls.
   Industry executives say Mr. Zyman has been taking a bigger
role in other areas at the company. They say he has been
particularly active with Diet Coke, one of the company's
fastest-growing products, which he helped pioneer in the
early 1980s. He appears to be consulting on the implications
of the 1992 expiration of Monsanto Co.'s patent on aspartame,
a low-calorie sweetener. Diet Coke is one of the biggest
customers for aspartame, which is marketed under the name
NutraSweet. The patent expiration could lead to lower
aspartame costs and higher profit margins for Diet Coke.
   Mr. Zyman, industry executives say, is also helping tinker
with Diet Coke's advertising, the most recent of which has
drawn criticism for using a spate of celebrities: Jerry Hall,
Chris Evert, Phylicia Rashad, Vanna White, and Sugar Ray
Leonard. Last year, Coke and Diet Coke spots featured 27
stars. Pepsi, too, has featured a string of stars over the
years.
   Despite the company's denial, industry executives say the
word has come down from officials high in the Coca-Cola tower
in Atlanta that the star wars are over. Although there
apparently is no all-out ban on celebrity ads, simple
endorsement spots are being discouraged, the industry
executives say. The company is favoring more creative
commercials -- something along the lines of Coke's recent ads
featuring Art Carney as a lovable grandfather.
   That push is likely to draw a counter-response from Pepsi.
Traditionally the two rivals react to changes in each others'
advertising. When Diet Coke ads attacked Pepsi last year --
suggesting that consumers were leaving Pepsi in droves for
Diet Coke-Pepsi fired back, challenging the claim with an ad
that poked fun at Coke's researchers. And whatever maneuvers
the big soda pop companies make, the changes inevitably cause
waves that affect the strategies of the smaller companies as
well.
