   The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission granted
Philadelphia Electric Co. a $242 million rate increase, which
is less than half of the $549 million amount the utility
requested to recover its costs of building and operating a
second nuclear unit at its Limerick power station in
Montgomery County, Pa.
   "Disallowing $300 million of the company's investment in
Limerick Unit 2 will force significant reductions in the
company's earnings, spending plans and common stock
dividend," said Joseph F. Paquette Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer. The company said its annual earnings will
reduced by about $1 a share; in 1989, it earned $590 million,
or $2.36 a share. It also will incur this year a one-time
charge of about $255 million, or about $1.20 a share, to
write off the part of its Limerick No. 2 investment that it
won't allowed to recover through its rate base.

   Philadelphia Electric's board will meet Monday to review
the dividend, now $2.20 annually, and consider a package of
possible spending cuts.
