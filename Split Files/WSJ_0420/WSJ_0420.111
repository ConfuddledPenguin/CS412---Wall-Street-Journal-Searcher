   Dayton Hudson Corp. agreed to buy Marshall Field's for
$1.04 billion, expanding its upscale department store
business with one of the most famous names in retailing.
   The purchase from B.A.T Industries PLC will make Dayton
Hudson the dominant department store retailer in Chicago,
with about a 15% share of the market. Dayton Hudson already
dominates the department store scene in its hometown of
Minneapolis, with its Dayton's stores, and in the Detroit
area with Hudson's stores.

   Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman and chief
executive officer, described the 24-store Field's chain, with
sales last year of about $1.09 billion, as "a great strategic
fit." After the acquisition, Dayton Hudson will run 61
high-end department stores with annual sales exceeding $2.8
billion.
   News of the acquisition, however, sent Dayton Hudson's
stock down $1.25 to close at $69.50 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the move reflected
investors' concerns that Dayton Hudson might be paying too
much and that it faces big risks in consolidating its
department store operations. Buying Field's, they suggested,
also may distract a company bent on expanding its Target
chain of discount stores and its low-end Mervyn's department
stores.
   But Mr. Macke, at a news conference in Chicago, defended
the transaction. "We think we got a value that meets all of
our hurdle rates," he said. He added that Dayton Hudson
intends to invest about $1.5 billion to expand its Target and
Mervyn's chains over the next two years.
   It's unclear, however, whether Philip B. Miller will
remain at the helm of Field's. Mr. Miller, who is widely
credited with turning around Field's since taking over as
chief executive in 1983, led an unsuccessful management bid
for the chain. "I'm disappointed," he said. "They had the
higher bid."
   Mr. Miller said he plans to meet with Dayton Hudson
officials on Monday. "I'm going to listen carefully to what
Dayton Hudson's plans are to assimilate Field's into their
operations," he said, "and I will react accordingly."
   Dayton Hudson President Stephen E. Watson praised Mr.
Miller's performance but said the company hadn't yet decided
whether to ask Mr. Miller to stay.
   Some Field's executives, meanwhile, expressed relief that
Dayton Hudson had outbid May Department Stores Co. and
Dillard Department Stores Inc., which both operate more
moderately priced department stores that cater to
less-affluent customers. "Dayton Hudson is a wonderful
company and I don't think anybody's bummed out by it. We all
just wanted it to be Miller," said one executive, who
requested anonymity.
   The executive explained that Dayton Hudson is "more in
line with the Field's life style in their customer approach,
merchandise mix and the way we run our stores."
   Analysts suggested, in fact, that Dayton Hudson outbid its
rivals because the similarities between its business and
Field's will allow it to more easily consolidate some
operations. These might include credit programs, accounting
functions and even merchandise buying, the analysts said.
   Dayton Hudson's Mr. Watson said the companies might reap
some savings by doing a joint private-label program. "We have
no plans at this point to make any changes, but there have to
be some advantages," he said.
   Still, the purchase price surprised some analysts,
although it was in line with the expectations of B.A.T. The
London-based conglomerate put Field's on the auction block
last year to fend off a takeover bid from Sir James
Goldsmith. "We said very clearly that this was not a fire
sale," said Arthur C. Martinez, senior vice president in
charge of B.A.T's U.S. retail operations. "We had a great
property in Marshall Field's and we expected to get a very
good price. That's exactly what has happened."
   Mr. Martinez added that Dayton Hudson might wind up paying
as much as $1.1 billion, after adjustments for expenditures
for store renovations and other projects that B.A.T will
continue until the closing date. He said he expects the deal,
which is subject to regulatory approval, to be completed in
six weeks.
   Dayton Hudson plans to finance the acquisition with a
combination of new debt and internally generated funds.
Analysts said they expect the company to borrow most of the
purchase price. Mr. Macke said only that he expects the
additional borrowing to push up the company's debt to 68% or
69% of capitalization from its current level of 62%. "We will
have absolutely no problem financing this," he added.
   Mr. Macke also predicted that the acquisition wouldn't
have a "material" effect on earnings in the current fiscal
year. But David Poneman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co., cut his earnings forecast for the current year to $5.80
a share from $6 to reflect the costs of integrating the
department store operations and possible severance payments
to Field's managers. The acquisition, he said, "enhances
Dayton Hudson's potential growth rate and makes strategic
sense, but at the cost of increasing their financial risk and
their operating risk."
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. also said it is considering
downgrading $2.7 billion of Dayton Hudson's long-term debt.
The rating agency said it is focusing on the company's cash
flow and debt protection as well as industry trends and the
strategic benefits of the acquisition.
