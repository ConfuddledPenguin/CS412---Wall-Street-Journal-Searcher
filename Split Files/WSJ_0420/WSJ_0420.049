   TOKYO -- International cooperation and financial vigilance
must be increased to establish a "minimum standard" to combat
money laundering, a task force convened to study the problem
said.
   The Financial Action Task Force called for rapid, tough
and practical measures to address the problem as a part of
overall international work to stop traffic in drugs.
Recommendations include closer monitoring by financial
institutions of transactions, more stringent laws and more
extensive cooperation by national and international
authorities.

   But acknowledging both the difficulty of such broad
coordination and some disagreement within its ranks, the task
force said that "political impetus would also be particularly
necessary to crystallize strong coordinated overall
international action" to hinder laundering of profits from
drug trafficking.
   The task force was created at the Paris summit of the
Group of Seven in July 1989 to study the money-laundering
process, the measures already in place to combat money
laundering, and to recommend further action. Fifteen
industrialized nations and the Commission of the European
Communities participated.
   The task force noted that differences among laws and
financial regulations of various nations can be exploited by
drug traffickers. National measures to fight the problem,
then, must be "harmonized" to have greatest impact.
   Most signficantly, laws to protect the secrecy of
financial institutions should be conceived so they don't
interfere with the task force's recommendations, the report
said.
   It stressed, however, that measures to fight money
laundering must not be allowed to inhibit free flow of
capital.
