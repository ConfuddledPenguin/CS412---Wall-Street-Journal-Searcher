   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp., operating the past year
under the cloud of a court judgment that it pay $750 million
to a pipeline joint venture, settled the case for $350
million.
   A settlement with Energy Transportation Systems Inc. had
been far from certain. In addition, the final figure came in
well below the $400 million to $450 million analysts expected
would be required to extricate Santa Fe from the huge
judgment, which was the result of an unfavorable ruling in an
antitrust case.

   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Santa Fe shares jumped $1.75 to close at $21.625, on volume
of nearly 900,000 shares.
   Not only was the settlement "smart, it was imperative,"
said First Boston Corp. analyst Graeme Lidgerwood, who added
that Santa Fe has been "basically blocked" from progressing
with its restructuring plans "until they could put the ETSI
litigation behind them."
   The settlement, combined with accelerated royalties
received under a recent agreement that resolved a separate
long-running lawsuit filed by Texas Utilities Co., resulted
in an after-tax first-quarter charge of $115 million, Santa
Fe said; yesterday the company reported a net loss of $61.4
million, or 39 cents a share.
   Under the agreement, the four ETSI partners will receive
$150 million in cash "as early as June 1," with a promissory
note for the balance. Santa Fe will pay $25 million in 1991
and 1992, and $30 million in each of five succeeding years.
   The partners of the failed, Houston-based joint venture
will sell the promissory note, rather than wait for the
payments. In a release, the companies said Enron Corp. and
Panhandle Eastern Corp. will each receive, after deduction of
legal fees, $69 million in pretax proceeds. K N Energy Inc.,
with a lesser stake in the failed venture, will receive about
$47 million. The fourth member, a unit of closely held
Bechtel Group Inc., with an indicated stake roughly similar
to K N Energy's, didn't disclose what it will receive.
   In the 1980s, ETSI had planned to construct a coal-slurry
pipeline linking the coal beds of Wyoming to Oklahoma and
Texas. The project was never built, and the venture
subsequently sued a number of railroads -- which profit from
hauling coal to the region's utilities -- for allegedly
conspiring to block the project. Santa Fe was the only
defendant that didn't settle the antitrust lawsuit before
trial.
   Last year, after a federal judge ruled against Santa Fe,
the company ended up owing adjusted damages of $750 million.
Although it had appealed the judgment, it signaled repeatedly
that it would be amenable to a settlement.
   "We continue to believe that we are innocent of the
charges in the ETSI case," said Santa Fe's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, Robert D. Krebs. But
the settlement, he said, is "the prudent course to follow in
view of the previous court action and the uncertainty and
cost of the appeal and retrial process."
   First Boston's Ms. Lidgerwood noted that the spread out
payments called for under the settlement will help the
company's cash flow. The company this summer probably will
replace the $780 million in payment-in-kind debentures it
issued under a 1988 recapitalization, she said. The timetable
for the planned spin-off of the company's 80%-owned
real-estate operation, and the unannounced but widely
expected spinoff of its energy unit, may advance as a result
of the settlement, she noted.
