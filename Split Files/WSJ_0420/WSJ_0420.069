   Regarding Thomas Sowell's March 6 editorial-page article,
"Affirmative Action: From Bad to Worse," I have heard
numerous arguments about the ills and dangers of enforced
affirmative-action programs, but I think this statistical
tripe takes the cake. Mr. Sowell is attempting to justify
discrimination with global mirrors.
   The fact that minority/majority over- or
under-representation exists world-wide is not the real issue.
The implication that such occurrences are the result of
natural and random forces is totally inaccurate. Each of the
situations discussed arose from a set of conditions peculiar
to that environment, and great care must be taken before
extrapolating and imposing generalized conclusions.

   The real issue is whether, in a white-dominated,
multiracial society, there will be equal opportunity for all.
Affirmative-action programs were not an arbitrary act: They
were a response to overt practices of discrimination and
resistance to change. They attempted to not just correct an
"imbalance" (as Mr. Sowell states), they attempted to correct
a continuing injustice. It is because of these efforts, and
the dedicated involvement of colorblind people, that women
and minorities have made a quantum leap forward.
   It is indeed unfortunate that enforced affirmative action
has taken place. But Mr. Sowell would have us believe that
these tools of social justice and economic parity are "a
danger to American society as a whole." He cloaks his
arguments in terms of reverse discrimination,
corporate-compliance costs, social upheaval, etc., but the
hidden dictum is quite clear. And it must be resisted.

   The fact that Jews in pre-World War II Europe were
clustered in certain professions did not occur randomly. Jews
were forbidden from entering trade guilds since the Middle
Ages. They found their niche in finance and lending because
the church proscribed against the practice of usury and
encouraged the Jews to take on what was considered unholy
work. Therefore it was an example of discrimination and a
poor choice for Mr. Sowell's article.

   Mr. Sowell's clever reasoning that majorities and
minorities around the world have been "over-represented and
under-represented" in institutions and occupations is
unrelated to the issue of affirmative action in the U.S. He
attempts to discredit, by examples, the affirmative-action
policies -- in government, industry and academia -- with his
claim that "the body-count approach is a danger to American
society." The greatest danger is the continued concentration
of wealth in the hands of Caucasians to the exclusion of
descendants of slaves. This country cannot compete
successfully with other nations if it does not recognize the
entrepreneurial skills of all its citizens.
   Mr. Sowell also claims that the U.S. will be polarized if
the country pursues affirmative-action policies. He has an
unusual talent for collecting useless information to support
his arguments about polarization. For more than 400 years,
the U.S. has been polarized by the racist policies of
American elitists who tried to annihilate the Indians at the
same time they were enslaving the Africans.

   The assumption behind affirmative-action policies is not,
as Mr. Sowell states, " . . . that different racial and
ethnic groups would be evenly or randomly represented in
institutions and occupations, in the absence of
discrimination." Rather, the assumption is that when
employment opportunities are unequally distributed in a
society characterized by historical patterns of institutional
racism, sexism, age and classism, it is not unreasonable to
assume that when a qualified minority person's attempts to
take advantage of "equal" access to employment opportunities
have been denied, that this is a result of discriminatory
practices.
   Accused employers are not asked to "prove" their
"innocence." Why not place the issue into the appropriate
legal context? A plaintiff is presenting "evidence" to
demonstrate harm, and the defendent has the responsibility to
provide "evidence" for aggrieved employers to address this
outcome.
   Sounds fair to me.
