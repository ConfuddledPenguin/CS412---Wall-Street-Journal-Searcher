   Washington talk fests typically aren't worth much, but
this week's White House gab on global warming was a
revelation. Not that I now know any more about the earth's
temperature. But I sure know a lot more about the politics.
   This isn't meant to be cynical. Politics is healthy and on
the environment more political skepticism is desperately,
achingly needed. Environmental debates are cast as morality
plays, black hats versus white, polluters against those with
a social conscience. But they also have as much to do with
interests as intentions. On global warming as much as on
trade or taxes, it helps to peer behind the moral posturing.

   For example, I had no idea how easy it is to cover one of
these green conferences. Environmentalists do the work for
you. The White House may have planned this meeting of 18
nations to fulfill a George Bush campaign promise. But the
enviros turned out to be the better politicians.
   "Have you seen the White House talking points yet?" asked
the cordial and intense Rafe Pomerance of the World Resources
Institute, a green hothouse. I had to admit I hadn't. "You've
got to get those talking points. They really lay out the
whole White House strategy."
   So Dan Becker, Rafe's pal at the Sierra Club, pulled the
talking points from his bag. Among the White House's shocking
orders to its troops: "Don't let reporters position this
conference as an attempt to delay serious decisions on this
issue." In other words, the White House practices media spin
control. Now, there's a scoop.
   The irony is especially rich because the spin control that
really worked was by the enviros. After President Bush gave a
Tuesday speech about the scientific and economic
"uncertainty" of global warming, the greens lined up outside
to say the U.S. wasn't doing enough.
   Mr. Pomerance ("The Europeans are leading . . . ") for 30
seconds, then the Sierra Club's Mr. Becker ("a smokescreen"),
followed by the Natural Resources Defense Council ("an
embarrassment") and the Union of Concerned Scientists ("one
problem is free-market ideology"). Seriatim sound-bites.
   Most networks and papers led with this critique, not with
Mr. Bush's message. It doesn't take a cynic to understand how
much this publicity will help Sierra Club fund-raising.
   Some Europeans -- Germany, France the Dutch -- are also
big warming mavens. They want the U.S., the biggest producer
of greenhouse gases, to impose taxes or remake cars and
toasters to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the
year 2000. But it's probably no accident that the Dutch only
emit 1% of the world's carbon gases. Or that the French have
huge reserves of clean nuclear power (spurned by our own
greens). Or that Germany could get a 20% reduction just by
cleaning up East Germany.
   One senior White House aide, a green himself, points out
that the politics of global warming is a world version of our
own Clean Air Act. The Europeans are trying to do to the U.S.
what Sen. Robert Byrd of coal-mining West Virginia did to
Midwest utilities: Stick the other guy with the bill. The
U.S., more reliant on coal and full of car-happy
suburbanites, would have to sacrifice much more. Meanwhile,
the Eurocrats would still get green credit back home.
   The Japanese also don't seem to mind if the U.S. redesigns
its cars to spill less carbon dioxide, especially if they can
sell us the cleaner cars. But please don't mention methane,
probably an even more pernicious greenhouse gas. "You cannot
abolish rice paddies" is the way one witty Japanese delegate
put it.
   Of course those pesky carbon-guzzlers in the developing
world also have an agenda, though almost no one noticed. On
Tuesday, the Polish delegate gave a splendid speech about the
importance of free markets to a clean environment. But the
press corps had already left to listen to the enviros and
West Europeans.
   The man from Zaire (per capita income: some $170 a year)
pointed out that about 80% of his nation's energy comes from
wood. Residents of Kinshasa are not clamoring for the Dutch
"carbon tax" (a levy on fossil-fuels), though they will
accept nuclear plants if Americans want to donate them.
   If all this sounds amusing, brace yourself because it's
just the beginning. The world's diplomats know a good thing
when they see it, and they're planning green conferences as
far ahead as the calender permits. Al Gore, the Tennessee
senator and warming maven, is even having his own
"Interparliamentary Conference on the Global Environment"
next month -- a sure sign that the politics is hot. Who
knows, maybe Mr. Gore's group will even debate the substance
of global warming.
   Ah, yes, the substance: As far as this layman can tell,
everyone agrees the earth has gotten slightly warmer in the
last 100 years. But most of this was before 1930, when
greenhouse gases couldn't have been the cause. The scientific
models also say that enough carbon gas is already in the air
to make us warmer, yet satellite data from the last 10 years
show almost no warming at all. No one seems to know what to
expect. Greater cloud cover may make the world hotter, or
maybe cooler. Ditto for the oceans. And even if the earth
does warm by two or three degrees, the impact may be
tolerable. Shorelines could flood, but Canada could bloom.
   Tepid stuff, shorn of the political hype. Which may be why
at a conference supposedly devoted to global warming, the
weather so rarely came up. At one point I asked a White House
official whether he thought global warming was occurring.
"You know, I just don't know," he said. "But we both know
that's not the point."
