   The marketability of Boeing Co.'s new airplane, the 767-X,
may hinge on a hinge.
   The world's leading jetliner maker, concerned about having
to squeeze the 767-X into airport gates that are growing
tighter all the time, is considering building the plane so
that the outer part of the wide-body's long wings can be
folded up after it lands.

   Although skeptics abound and no one is sure how the
traveling public will react, Boeing believes that a folding
wing could give it an edge over its competitors, particularly
Airbus Industrie, whose A-330 twin-jet is too wide to fit
into parking spaces now occupied by slimmer, aging aircraft.
"The airlines are really encouraging us to tailor a design so
they'll have no changes to make in their infrastructure,"
says Alan Mulally, vice president for engineering on the
767-X. "We're converging very fast on a practical,
implementable design."
   "This is clearly going to be the way of the future," says
Michael Durham, chief financial officer for AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines, which has prodded Seattle-based Boeing to
explore folding-wing technology. He's also trying to spur
McDonnell Douglas Corp. to try the folding wing on an
advanced version of its newly planned tri-jet, the MD-12X.
James Guyette, executive vice president for operations at
United Airlines, says the UAL Corp. unit is also
contemplating joining the fold as a potential customer.
   But others remain doubtful that the idea will get very
far. And they argue that before an aircraft manufacturer
commits to such a radical move, the aviation industry needs
to consider this fundamental question: Should ever-larger
aircraft be rigged to fit into increasingly packed airports,
or should airports be revamped to handle bigger, more modern
jets?
   The answer is important. Facility managers say overcrowded
gates are one cause of the flight delays plaguing airports
all over the country. According to the Partnership for
Improved Air Travel, an aviation coalition that includes
carriers as well as aircraft manufacturers, 17 of the
nation's major airports experienced significant congestion in
1985. That figure is expected to jump to 58 by the end of
this decade. And the delays are costly, already the
equivalent of grounding 250 commercial planes every day.
   About a year ago, Airbus rejected the idea of using
folding wings on its larger craft, concluding that there
wasn't enough demand to offset the indirect costs of using
such a system. "Airports always have adapted to new
generations of aircraft," says Barnard Ziegler, senior vice
president for engineering at Airbus, the European consortium.
"I don't think folding wings are the right way to solve"
gridlock.
   The folding wing may add a few million dollars to the
price of the plane, not that much in the realm of aircraft.
But it would cost more in other ways. Indeed, airlines have
to consider the extra weight that folding wings would add --
up to 2,800 pounds by Boeing's own estimate. Airbus
calculated that in the case of its A-330, folding wings would
equal the weight of 15 passengers and their luggage.
   On top of that, folding wings would mean more hydraulic
equipment to check and maintain, driving up a carrier's
operating expenses. "Whenever you have another thing to
control from the cockpit, you're increasing the complexity,"
says David Hazen, professor emeritus of aeronautical
engineering at Princeton University. A pre-flight review of
the folding wings couldn't even begin until a plane backed
out onto the tarmac.
   Some also wonder how safe the traveling public would feel
on a plane where nearly a quarter of each wing would swing 90
degrees perpendicularly. "The airline industry doesn't need
to give people one more thing to be afraid of," says Tim
Becker, a former manager with American Airlines and Braniff
and now a marketing professor at San Diego State University.
"It may not be rational, but the public could see the fold as
another fatigue point. They'd be jumpy."
   Also, by fitting a 410-passenger plane into a gate that
now handles a 380-seater at most, "you just aggravate how
full it is inside the terminal," says Francis McKelvey, a
professor of civil engineering at Michigan State University.
"The airport terminals of today are becoming crowded like the
bus terminals of the '40s and '50s. And I don't think the
traveler is going to accept that."
   There aren't any guarantees that Boeing will go ahead with
the folding wing, and there's a chance it will offer the
design simply as an option on some members of the 767-X
family. Officials at the company stress that the
configuration of the twin-engine 767-X -- to be renamed the
777 once the receipt of firm orders officially launches the
line -- is far from certain.
   Yet Boeing is giving the idea far more weight than it did
six months ago. American Airlines says Boeing's engineers are
now saying they've eliminated surplus drag generated by their
first folding-wing models. A few weeks ago, the company
reportedly began building a prototype of the hinges that
would be used to fold up the outer 20 to 25 feet of the
767-X's wings, each of which would be roughly 88 feet long
from tip to fuselage.
   Folding wings aren't revolutionary in and of themselves.
For decades, the Navy has folded the wings of its fighters in
order to position them on the crowded decks of aircraft
carriers. "Some people think the folding wing is a scary
concept," says Bill Whitlow, who follows Boeing for the
Seattle brokerage firm Dain Bosworth Inc. and once piloted
Navy A-3s himself. "But it's no different than fold-up
landing gear. You don't even notice it."
   Airlines today want planes with especially long wings.
That's because an aircraft's efficiency is measured by the
ratio of the wing's width to its span -- what engineers call
the "aspect ratio." The span of the 767-X is 197 feet, nearly
the same as a 747-400 jumbo jet.
   But with open gate areas at airports becoming harder to
find, Boeing has been forced to consider the options in
fitting such long wings into designated areas. The company
looked at parking the 767-X at a 60-degree angle, instead of
pulling it straight in. That, however, could require airlines
to re-jigger their entire ground-support network. "There's a
lot of debate within the airline industry as to what is going
to be the most cost-effective solution," says Steven
Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease Finance Corp., a
big Boeing buyer. "I think the jury is still out."
   Some, though, have already decided to go for the fold. If
you're going to increase the wingspan, American Airlines' Mr.
Durham declares, "you've just got to be able to bend it."
