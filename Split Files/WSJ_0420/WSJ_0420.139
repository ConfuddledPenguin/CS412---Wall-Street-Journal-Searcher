   Two paper-producing concerns, Bowater Inc. and Union Camp
Corp., posted first-quarter profit declines of 43% and 15%,
respectively, reflecting heavy price discounting.
   Bowater, a newsprint producer based in Darien, Conn., had
net income of $22.2 million, or 59 cents a share, down from
$38.9 million, or $1.04 a share. Sales declined 5.7% to
$338.3 million from $358.7 million.

   The newsprint, coated-paper and pulp segments were hurt by
increased price discounting, Bowater said. It added that
operating costs were higher because of continued start-up
expenses at several mills and the temporary shutdown of a
newsprint machine at its Nova Scotia mill.
   Bowater said earnings for the rest of the year will
largely depend on how newsprint and market pulp are affected
by the U.S. and world economies, the relative strength of the
dollar and the success of a price increase effective June 1.
   At Union Camp, Wayne, N.J., first-quarter net income fell
to $67.4 million, or 98 cents a share, from $79.7 million, or
$1.16 a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped to $701.5
million from $706.2 million.
   Gene Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the results reflected lower prices for linerboard and
uncoated business paper.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bowater
closed at $25.50, down 37.5 cents, and Union Camp closed at
$37.375, unchanged.
