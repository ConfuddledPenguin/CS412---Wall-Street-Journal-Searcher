   Marketers may have found a new way to reach affluent
consumers -- by linking up with Broadway shows.
   Corporations in the past have hooked up with Broadway
plays and musicals only occasionally, sometimes by investing
money, other times by donating products for use on stage in
exchange for a credit in the program. But now, more
advertisers are considering becoming promotional partners
with Broadway shows -- with the intention of getting their ad
messages to affluent crowds.

   This season, Epi Products, a Santa Monica, Calif., maker
of health and beauty aids, made a sizable financial
investment in "Meet Me in St. Louis," and then used the show
as a venue to attract new consumers to its product line.
   Epi and "Meet Me in St. Louis" shared the spotlight in
radio and print ad campaigns. One promotion offered plane
tickets to New York and tickets to the show's opening as the
top prize.
   "It's been a very happy marriage," says Christopher
Seabrooke, one of the show's three producers. "Epi hasn't
looked on the investment in the show just as a straight
investment. They see it as a promotional tool and as image
promotion for their company."
   American Express also has taken to the Broadway circuit,
having recently sponsored the opening night party of the
revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," which stars Kathleen
Turner and Charles Durning. American Express funded the event
in conjunction with offering a number of tickets to its gold
card members.
   Broadway's relatively affluent audience makes it a natural
for many marketers, says Don White, president of Saugatuck
Direct, a Westport, Conn., direct marketing and promotions
agency. "Our clients are thinking about ways to make their
advertising dollars work harder and to really focus those
dollars on the customers and prospects they really want," he
says.
   Mr. White says that Saugatuck has been shopping the idea
around to a number of big advertisers, adding that the firm
is in discussions with a financial services company and some
packaged-goods firms to develop promotional tie-ins with road
tours of Broadway shows. He says such sponsorships, which
offer an advertiser the prospect of mentions on publicity
materials, ticket stubs and in the program, start at about
$250,000.
   New Musicals, a newly formed producing group that plans to
mount 16 productions over the next four years, also is
talking with a corporation for sponsorship of one of its
first shows, a musical called "Secret Garden." New Musicals
wouldn't name the company with which it is holding
discussions.
   Producers seem intrigued by the idea of promotional
tie-ins. Barry Weissler, a producer whose current shows
include "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Gypsy," says, however,
that corporate participation works only "if they're the right
corporation." The sponsorships and tie-ins need to be geared
to the particular show and to the corporation's needs, he
says.
   For "Meet Me in St. Louis," Epi designed a number of
promotions to boost ticket sales and increase sales of its
own products. At the cosmetics counter at Macy's department
store in New York, for example, Epi offered consumers a free
ticket to the show if they purchased another ticket and an
Epi product.
   But like a conventional investment in a Broadway show,
promotional tie-ins and sponsorships carry a certain amount
of risk. For every Broadway hit, there are many failures.
Corporations, of course, don't have any control on the show's
quality and take a chance with any vehicle.
   "In almost any new marketing initiative, you're going to
take some risk," says Ken Chenault, president of the consumer
card group at American Express. "We do try to carefully
screen the productions. But at the end of the day, it's a
judgment call," he adds.

   Fitzgerald Quits Ketchum
                                                                                                       

   John W. Fitzgerald left his post as chairman of Ketchum
Advertising/USA to take the top post at McCann-Erickson's New
York office.
   At McCann, an Interpublic Group agency, Mr. Fitzgerald
will be vice chairman and chief operating officer. He will
report to John Dooner, who has been president of
McCann-Erickson North America since the end of 1988.
   Ketchum's ad operations were headed up by Mr. Fitzgerald,
who is 43 years old, and Robert W. Kroyer, who is president.
The unit of Ketchum Communications said it hasn't decided
whether to appoint someone to succeed Mr. Fitzgerald.
   In a letter to Ketchum executives, Mr. Fitzgerald said he
left because of a "desire to accelerate personal growth."

   Ad Notes. . . .

   MOVIE INVESTIGATION: The Federal Trade Commission is
looking into whether moves by movie studios to ban on-screen
ads in theaters constitute restraint of trade. A FTC
spokeswoman declined to comment, but a Justice Department
spokesman confirmed that the FTC has been looking at Walt
Disney's decision in February to ban theaters from running
commercials when they show Disney movies. Earlier this week,
Time Warner's Warner Bros. announced a similar move to ban
commercials in theaters.
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN AIRLINES: DDB Needham was named to handle
advertising for American Airlines in 15 Latin American
countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. The
account will bill an estimated $10 million. DDB Needham, a
unit of Omnicom Group, also handles American Airlines'
domestic ad account.
                                                                                                       

   STARKIST: Actor Peter Horton will appear in a TV
commercial touting StarKist Seafood's recently announced
policy not to catch tuna in a manner harmful to dolphins. The
H.J. Heinz affiliate's ad, created by Leo Burnett, Chicago,
will appear tonight during "Dolphins, Whales and Us," a
program on CBS.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: The Board of Tourism of Mazatlan in Mexico
awarded its $3 million ad account to Castellanos Latina
