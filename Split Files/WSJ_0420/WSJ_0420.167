   Schlumberger Ltd., New York, citing improvements in all
its oil-field-service businesses, reported a 56% jump in
first-quarter earnings.
   "We were estimating 50 cents {a share}, they earned 54
cents, but most of the difference was a lower tax rate," said
James D. Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.

   But he and the company sounded an optimistic note for the
industry. The results "strengthen our conviction that we are
at the start of an up cycle in the oil industry," said
Schlumberger Chairman Euan Baird.
   Net income totaled $128.6 million, up from $82.3 million,
or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.4% to
$1.22 billion.
   Mr. Crandell noted stronger-than-expected revenue in three
areas of Schlumberger: the Dowell Schlumberger 50-50
pumping-services joint venture with Dow Chemical Co.; the
Anadrill well-drilling business; and the GECO operation,
which provides computerized three-dimensional geological
profiles.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
shares of Schlumberger rose 25 cents to close at $50.75.
