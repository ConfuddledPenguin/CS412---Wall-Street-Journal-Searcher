   NEW YORK -- In a move that could shake the nation's
banking system, Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the
long-term and, for the first time, the short-term debt of
Citicorp and some units under review for a possible
downgrade.
   A downgrading would affect $31 billion of the parent
company's securities, increasing the company's short-term
cost of funds and dealing a major blow to its prestige.
Importantly, the short-term rating of Citibank, its flagship,
isn't under review.

   "Citicorp always has been the bank that was `too big to
downgrade.' They were regarded as untouchable," said Ann
Robinson, a bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. "If Citicorp is downgraded, it's like saying
that the whole U.S. banking system is being downgraded."
   With $230 billion in assets, Citicorp is the nation's
largest banking company and a bellwether for the banking
industry. Analysts say a downgrading of Citicorp could
intensify investor jitters about banks as a group and cause
them to demand higher yields on bank debt.
   The bond market has treated Citicorp debt, whose senior
debt carries an singleA-1 rating, much more kindly than most
other bank debt. There has been plenty of demand for its
debt, and prices have held up comparatively well at a time
when yields on some bank debt, such as Midlantic Corp., have
climbed to 20%.
   Moody's announcement came after the close of trading. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
Citicorp common stock fell 21.5 cents to close at $23.75 a
share.
   While ratings reviews don't always result in ratings
changes, some analysts believe that, in the current harsh
regulatory climate for banks, a downgrading of Citicorp is
likely. Moody's, which has been aggressive in downgrading
bank ratings, recently placed obligations of Chase Manhattan
Corp., which has a more conservative risk profile and a
stronger capital base, under review for an upgrade. But
instead of upgrading Chase, it affirmed its existing rating.
   Christopher T. Mahoney, a vice president at Moody's, said
the company was concerned by Citicorp's mounting levels of
nonperforming loans in commercial real estate, highly
leveraged transactions and developing-country loans, as well
as its capital adequacy.
   "We have to take a look in greater depth at their
exposure," said Mr. Mahoney.
   In response, a Citicorp spokesman said, "We trust that
Moody's will agree with us that a change isn't justified."
   Moody's, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., last reviewed
Citicorp's rating about two years ago at the height of
concern about developing country-loans. At that time, Moody's
affirmed the holding company's debt rating but downgraded the
bank.
   Citicorp satisfies about 15% of its funding needs through
the commercial paper market and about 10% by issuing longterm
debt. About 60% of its funds come from customer deposits,
which wouldn't be affected by a rating change.
   Citicorp is the biggest lender to commercial real estate,
with a $13 billion portfolio of loans outstanding. The
company is also the biggest lender to highly leveraged
transactions, with $7.9 billion outstanding; and to
developing countries, with $8.6 billion in medium- and
long-term debt.
   In the first quarter, Citicorp's nonperforming assets
climbed 11% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion, while its
reserves to absorb losses have remained about 61%, below the
70% level kept by some other banks. And its common equity, at
3.6% of total assets, is well below the 4% or more of most
peer banks.
   Citicorp has pointed to the global and varied nature of
its business, particularly its strong consumer business, in
arguing why its numbers don't always coincide with industry
norms. And Chairman John S. Reed has adamantly insisted that
he wants to build Citicorp's capital base to 4.5% through
retained earnings and nonstrategic asset sales and not by
issuing new shares, which would dilute existing shareholders.
