   Tokyo stock prices surged for the second straight day
yesterday as the strength of the yen encouraged bargain
hunting over a broad range of shares.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which advanced
787.46 points Wednesday, finished at 29945.41, up 696.35
points.

   Trading was active. The pace of the strong advances was
set by sectors such as steel manufacturing, shipbuilding and
gas and electric utilities.
   The popularity of these large-capital stocks pushed up
volume on the first section to an estimated one billion
shares, the highest level since the beginning of this year.
Volume was 489 million shares Wednesday.
   Winners outpaced losers 855 to 141, while 103 issues
remained unchanged.
   In early trading Friday, the Nikkei index was up 35.74
points to 29981.15.
   Thursday's recovery of the yen worked against shares of
electronics makers, which had been bought on expectations
that the weaker yen would benefit these export-oriented
companies, traders said.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which advanced 39.39 points Wednesday, was up
45.53 points, or 2.10%, at 2213.49.
   The second section index, which gained 16.76 points
Wednesday, was up 26.87 points, or 0.76%, to close at
3551.43.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at nine million
shares, up from eight million shares Wednesday.
   Active buying started right from the beginning of the day.
   Wednesday's strong advances, despite the dollar's rise
above 160 yen, made investors feel secure about buying
yesterday, traders said. The market's rise supported
investors' belief the Nikkei hit bottom around 27000 points
and that stock prices are unlikely to fall too far below that
level, they said.
   In addition, yesterday's fall in the dollar, in the face
of a favorable report on U.S. trade in February, spawned
expectations the dollar may stabilize below the 160-yen
level, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar opened the day at 158.35 yen,
compared with 158.13 yen in New York late Wednesday and
159.87 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday. The U.S. unit slid
further yesterday to finish at 157.75 yen in Tokyo.
   The yen's sharp recovery boosted trade momentum.
Institutions, corporations and foreign investors actively
sought out stocks that appeared to have been oversold in the
past month and thus had good potential for a technical
rebound, traders said.
   Steel and shipbuilding shares, which are priced mostly
below 1,000 yen, also attracted individual investors, who
have been severely hurt by margin calls, traders said.
   Yesterday's strong winners included Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, which was up 60 yen to 860 yen ($5.47), and Kobe
Steel, which advanced 34 to 613.
   Among utilities issues, Chubu Electric gained 190 to
3,160, while Tokyo Gas was up 43 to 767.
   Also advancing strongly were trading houses such as
Marubeni, which rose 41 to 794, and railway companies such as
Keisei, which gained 80 to 1,630.
   High-technology shares declined. Pioneer was down 120 at
5,950. TDK, which advanced 460 Wednesday, fell 100 to 6,740.
   In London, share prices finished significantly lower, as
the early morning demise of a longstanding technical support
point left investors with little confidence in the market.
   Shares got off to a shaky start on the back of a weak
performance overnight on Wall Street. The jitters continued
throughout the morning as the 2200-point barrier on the
broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell away, leaving investors uncertain of the market's next
direction.
   But most commentators suggested they witnessed no
wholesale selling, as share prices were largely scaled back
by market makers amid a cautious and confused market.
   At the close, the 100-share index was down 21.2 points at
2184.7, off its early morning best of 2194.9 and up a bit
from the midafternoon low of 2180.5. The index last closed
below 2200 on Nov. 22.
   The narrower 30-share index was down 20.4 points at
1712.2. Volume reached a moderately active 491.9 million
shares, compared with the 352.5 million of Wednesday.
   On the corporate front, B.A.T Industries shares finished
just three pence lower at 720 pence ($11.80). The
conglomerate said it has agreed to sell its retail subsidiary
Marshall Field for $1.04 billion to Dayton Hudson Corp. of
the U.S.
   The sale of Marshall Field is part of a major
restructuring of B.A.T to concentrate on its core businesses
of tobacco and financial services operations in an effort to
stave off a takeover bid by Sir James Goldsmith.
   Elsewhere around the market, beverage concern Allied-Lyons
finished up six pence at 432. It said it will sell its
Embassy Hotels chain to Jarvis Hotels Ltd. for #202 million
($331 million).
   Royal Insurance slipped 6 pence to 449. The composite
insurer said it expects losses related to storms in Britain
to amount to #100 million in the first quarter.
   In Frankfurt, West German share prices closed lower, but
above intraday lows, in moderate trading.
   The German Stock Index (DAX) declined 10.89 to end at
1878.87. The blue chips led the market lower, as electronics
concern Siemens dropped eight marks to 762 marks ($455.70),
Daimler-Benz fell 13 to 899 and Deutsche Bank dipped 4.50 to
787. Siemens had been as low as 758 early in the session
before selective buying brought it slightly back.
   Machinery-maker issues were again pushed down sharply, as
Linde fell 9 to 986, MAN dropped 9.50 to 487.50 and
Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD) fell 2 to 270.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in
Stockholm, lower in Paris, Zurich, Milan and Amsterdam, and
mixed in Brussels.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Hong
Kong and Wellington and were lower in Sydney, Seoul,
Singapore, Taipei and Manila.
