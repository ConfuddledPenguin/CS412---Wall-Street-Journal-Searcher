   TORONTO -- National Bank of Canada said it would support a
Campeau Corp. proposal to defer its interest payments on 184
million Canadian dollars (US$158.4 million) of 7% convertible
debentures.
   Andre Berard, president and chief executive officer of
National Bank, said he would agree to an interest-payment
deferral for Campeau because the troubled retailer is
"basically sound" and needs time to restructure its finances.

   "I will agree to any decent proposal that is to give those
people the time and the freedom to restructure and do a
better job," Mr. Berard said after a luncheon speech here.
   Montreal-based National Bank holds C$60.4 million of the 7
1/2% debentures. It registered them under its name in January
along with other Campeau securities when Campeau's chairman,
Robert Campeau, defaulted on personal loans by missing
interest payments on C$153 million of debt.
   Campeau missed interest payments last month on its two
series of convertible debentures. At a special meeting June
1, Campeau will ask holders of its 7 1/2% debentures to waive
defaults triggered by the missed payments until Dec. 31,
1991.
   National Bank has a 35% fully diluted voting stake in
Campeau and two seats on its board. Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., the real estate concern owned by Toronto's
Reichmann family, holds C$46.6 million of the 7 1/2%
debentures and all of Campeau's US$260 million of 7%
convertible debentures. Sources close to Olympia &amp; York
previously said the Reichmanns likely would be willing to
support an interest-payment deferral on the debentures.
   National Bank's Mr. Berard said Campeau's Canadian
properties and its U.S. retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., are high quality assets
even though Federated and Allied are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings and the real estate assets largely are pledged as
collateral for loans.
   "I think if we take the time, if we compromise, if we
support a restructuring of that group, we'll end up better
three years down the road than we are today," Mr. Berard
said.
   As for Mr. Campeau's personal financial problems stemming
from the bankruptcy-law filing of Federated and Allied and
the subsequent plunge in Campeau's stock price, Mr. Berard
said the situation was "difficult." He declined to say
whether the bank would seek a court order in Ontario enabling
it to seize Mr. Campeau's personal assets.
   Mr. Campeau is facing a C$50 million lawsuit from National
Bank and a C$12.5 million lawsuit from Bank of Nova Scotia
related to defaults on his personal loans. Last week, Bank of
Montreal obtained a court order requiring Mr. Campeau to
repay C$26.7 million outstanding in a personal loan. The
order could entitle the bank to seize Mr. Campeau's personal
assets.
