   Over-the-counter investors continued to punish stocks of
companies with disappointing earnings, sending Seagate
Technology down about 20% in active trading after the
computer disk drive maker reported third-quarter profit below
analysts' expectations.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed off 2.52 at 429.00, a
0.58% drop, on 145.6 million shares, down from 149.7 million.
By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped
0.77%.

   Declining stocks continued to outpace advancers, 1,065 to
820, while 127 stocks hit new lows compared with 83 reaching
new highs.
   "It seems this market is taking earnings disappointments a
lot more strongly than positives," said Peter Coolidge,
senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody. "If earnings come out
and are in line or a little worse then expected, stocks take
it on the chin. But if they come out a little better than
expected, they don't go up as much."
   Seagate fell 3 1/8 to close at 12 1/8. Apple Computer also
dropped, down 3 at 40 1/4 on 4.3 million shares. The company
told analysts in a conference call late Wednesday that it
expects revenue for the second half of the year to grow only
7% to 10% from a year earlier, rather than 15% or more as
previously estimated, according to Goldman Sachs analyst
Daniel Benton.
   Mr. Benton said he reduced his investment opinion on the
computer manufacturer to a "hold" from a "trading buy"
because of the expected softness. Slower growth should show
up particularly in sales of Apple's less expensive computers,
such as the Macintosh Portable, Mr. Benton said.
   Among gainers was Lotus Development, up 1 to 34 1/4 after
reporting first-quarter earnings on the high end of Wall
Street expectations. The Cambridge, Mass., software maker
attributed the earnings strength to across-the-board customer
demand and accelerated international sales.
   However, technology stocks generally were weaker, noted
Lawrence Rice, manager of OTC trading for Los Angeles-based
Wedbush Morgan Securities. Like Mr. Coolidge of Kidder
Peabody, Mr. Rice said he saw both buying and selling
interest scattered across a number of sectors.
   Among the market's cheerleaders was Mitch Meisler, OTC
director of marketing for Shearson Lehman Hutton, who said he
expects the bond market to "turn on a dime any day now" with
the OTC market following. Mr. Meisler added that he believes
fears of inflation are overblown.
   Among the day's top leaders were two preferred shares of
First Executive Corp., the Los Angeles holder of a large
portfolio of junk bonds. First Executive cumulative preferred
series F jumped 1 5/8 at 8 3/4, while the series E preferred
shares rose 1 3/8 to 5 7/8. Craig Mosovitz, trader at
Interstate/Johnson Lane Securities, said he saw demand for
the preferred issues from investors who were paid their
dividends this week and expect future payments.
   However, Thomas Rosencrants, director of research for the
brokerage's Atlanta office, cautioned that First Executive's
most recent quarterly report indicates it has sufficient
funds to meet its fixed obligations only through 1990, but
will require additional funds for the first quarter of 1991.
Mr. Rosencrants said he's advising investors to avoid First
Executive's preferred and common shares.
   DeKalb Genetics, a commercial seed producer, gained 1 1/2
to 37 3/4 after announcing it had successfully inserted
foreign genes into corn plants. Also gaining was BioTechnica
International, up 3/8 at 4 1/2, which made a similar
bioengineering claim in January.
   Shares of Eastchester Financial, White Plains, N.Y., hit a
new 52-week high at 16 1/4, up 1 1/2, on more than 13 times
average volume after announcing it reached an agreement to be
acquired for $20 a share by North Fork Bancorp, based in
Mattituck, N.Y. Up in sympathy was another New York bank,
Peoples Westchester Savings, which rose 1/4 at 16 1/4.
   Shares of Chemfix Technologies, which treats hazardous
waste, rose 5/8 to 6 3/8 in heavy trading after an analyst at
Rotan Mosle recommended purchase of the stock, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Also, Ohio Casualty
converted its preferred stake into 315,000 shares of Chemfix
common stock, which it then sold, according to the news
service.
   Shares of SciMed Life Systems, a maker of catheters used
in heart surgery, fell 7/8 to 25 7/8 on 1.45 million shares
after a competitor, C. R. Bard, said it sent a letter to
SciMed alleging the company is infringing on a Bard patent,
the investor report said. However, Bard hasn't yet filed a
lawsuit suit alleging patent infringement.
   Mr. Coolidge of Kidder Peabody said profit taking
apparently pressured shares of two companies involved in
cleaning up the environment. Sevenson Environmental Services
fell 2 to 12 3/4 and ERC Environmental &amp; Energy Services lost
3/4 to 11 1/4. Mr. Coolidge noted that "the hype" about the
forthcoming Earth Day had inflated the shares of some
environmental services companies.
