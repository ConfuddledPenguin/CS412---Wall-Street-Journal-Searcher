   CHULA VISTA, Calif. -- Rohr Industries Inc., which makes
aircraft engine housings and parts, and solid rocket motor
casings and nozzles, said it received a contract from
Seattle-based Boeing Co. valued at more than $280 million,
including options, to provide jet engine struts for Boeing
757 aircraft.
   The new contract begins in January; Rohr has delivered
struts for more than 300 Boeing 757s since 1981 under a
500-airplane contract. A strut is the structure that attaches
the propulsion system to the aircraft.
