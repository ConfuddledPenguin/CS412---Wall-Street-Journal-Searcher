   The Labor Department moved to fine Phillips Petroleum Co.
$5.7 million, accusing the company of willful safety
violations in connection with the explosions at a chemical
plant near Houston in October.
   Phillips said it would contest many of the citations. "We
really take issue with the word `willful' because we don't
think we compromised the safety of our workers," a spokesman
said.

   The alleged violations are viewed by many as part of an
industry-wide pattern of safety hazards that has led to
numerous explosions and fires at oil and chemical plants in
the past two years. Many experts blame these accidents on
operations at or above practical capacity. Some unions,
consultants and industry executives say companies don't want
to stop production and do needed maintenance, and this, they
say, has compromised safety.
   The department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration said it has uncovered internal Phillips
documents "that called for corrective action but which were
largely ignored." And in a report on chemical-industry safety
problems that will go to the White House soon, a study
commissioned by the Labor Department will note other
instances of chemical companies that "refused to be
responsive to" internal audit reports that warned of safety
hazards, said Alan McMillan, an OSHA official. Those
instances won't show the same "scope" as the Phillips
documents, however, he said.
   Work on that report has been pushed along by the Phillips
catastrophe.
   The explosions and an accompanying fire killed 23 workers
and injured more than 130 at Phillips's Pasadena, Texas,
petrochemical plant. The $5.7 million fine is the
second-largest the agency has ever proposed against a single
company.
   OSHA also proposed penalties of $730,000 against Fish
Engineering &amp; Construction Inc., a Houston-area contractor on
the chemical plant's site. Fish said it would contest the
citations.
   OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willful violations, involving
failure to protect 566 workers from fire and explosion
dangers, and of other "serious violations." The citations
included failure to prevent the uncontrolled release of
flammable vapors, use of inappropriate valves and inadequate
fire protection. Fish was cited for 181 willful violations,
including failure to protect its workers from fire and
explosion.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said there was "clear
evidence that this explosion was avoidable had recognized
safety procedures been followed." OSHA officials wouldn't
discuss the Phillips documents.
   The fire and explosions, one of America's biggest postwar
industrial accidents, shook downtown Houston a dozen miles
away and resulted in the most fatalities of any accident at
an oil refinery or petrochemical plant in recent years.
   Some industry officials said a vastly reduced work force
and the oil industry's increasing dependence on outside
contractors have contributed to heightened danger at plants.
   Fish has been the almost-exclusive maintenance contractor
at the Pasadena site for about 17 years and has performed a
similar role at other Phillips plants, OSHA said. Four of the
workers killed and 52 of those injured worked for Fish.
   "Phillips is not a renegade," said Richard Leonard,
director of special projects for the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union. "There is very little difference between them
and other companies around the country," he said.
   Glen Williamson, an OSHA deputy regional director, said
yesterday's action "sends a very clear signal that the agency
is going to take a very strong enforcement position." OSHA
has come under fire from safety experts for what they
consider innocuous fines, sometimes only hundreds of dollars,
for violations at many plants, but it has been taking a
stronger tack since Gerard Scannell took over as head of the
agency last year.
   Even so, Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the
House Government Operations Subcommittee on Employment and
Housing, said the Phillips explosion showed "the cop was not
on the beat." He noted that two months before the October
explosions, an accident at the same plant killed one worker
and seriously injured two others, but OSHA didn't do a
complete inspection. The last full sweep was in 1974.
   After hearing news reports of the August incident, OSHA
investigators did show up, ultimately determining that during
routine maintenance, gases escaped to an area where welding
torches touched off a flash fire and explosion. OSHA fined
Phillips $720.
   OSHA said its inspections of Phillips plants in a
four-state region showed 18 deaths and many hospitalizations
prior to October.
   Mr. Scannell said the primary cause of the fire and
explosions in October was the release, during maintenance
work, of four highly flammable process gases from an open
valve between a reactor vessel and a chemical-settling leg.
Most of the gas escaped quickly because of high pressure, and
a huge vapor cloud sped through the plant and exploded when
it came in contact with an ignition source, OSHA said. Other
explosions followed.
   Contrary to Phillips procedures and industry practice,
there was no backup protection against valve failure or
untimely valve opening, OSHA said.
   Phillips's own investigation asserted that the valve
should have been closed but wasn't because of "human error,"
a spokesman said.
   The Phillips explosions seemed to frighten the oil
industry into tightening up its maintenance procedures.
Unlike the situation in 1988 and 1989, when many companies
postponed maintenance and ran their plants full out, this
year they have closed down equipment to perform necessary
housekeeping. Plants are running around 80% to 85% of
capacity, and the number of fires and explosions appears to
have been reduced markedly. But in December, part of a huge
Exxon Corp. refinery in Baton Rouge, La., exploded, killing
two workers.
   Phillips and Fish have 15 days to contest the citations
before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission.
