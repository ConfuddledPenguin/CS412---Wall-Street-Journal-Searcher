   McDonald's Corp.'s reported a 12% increase in
first-quarter earnings, the 100th consecutive quarter in
which the fast-food chain's earnings and revenue have gone
up.
   McDonald's said it earned $158.1 million, or 43 cents a
share, compared with $141.7 million, or 38 cents, in the
year-earlier quarter. The 1989 per-share figure reflects a
2-for-1 split last May. Revenue rose 11%, to $1.53 billion
from $1.38 billion.

   But the numbers seemed almost incidental to the streak.
Indeed, for more than a year, McDonald's has been noting that
its earnings gains were approaching the century mark.
   Thus the actual feat called for something McSpecial.
Accordingly, after combing through 25 years of earnings for
corporate America, a McDonald's researcher happily reported
that "no other company in the current Standard &amp; Poor's 500
has publicly reported results which equal this record."
   McDonald's also said its stock is held by more investment
clubs in the National Association of Investors Corp. than any
other security.
