   The Securities and Exchange Commission recently set off a
fresh round of debate over how to make the American
marketplace more competitive when it introduced a new program
for private-placement security sales known as Rule 144A.
Opponents of the change argue that the rule, which provides a
"safe harbor" from disclosure and registration burdens for
large traders, favors those traders at the expense of the
small investor. But Rule 144A actually can benefit the small
investor. More important, 144A will benefit the entire market
by lowering the cost of capital in the U.S.
   The SEC was designed to protect the smallest investor --
widows and orphans whose pensions might depend on stock
shares. Companies could traditionally avoid some of the SEC's
more onerous disclosure and registration rules by selling
their securities privately to institutional investors. These
days, the private-placement market is growing rapidly -- some
35% of all corporate financings last year were private
placements. But before rule 144A, such transactions faced an
important obstacle. SEC regulations limited resale of
private-placement stocks, reducing their liquidity.

   For a long time, this system hurt the competitiveness of
the U.S. as a marketplace. For years, rival markets
comparable to the U.S. market in size, liquidity and quality
of participants have been springing up. Arguably, these
marketplaces are less efficient. But they make up for this
disadvantage by being less regulated. When a U.S. company
decides to raise capital, one of the first places it looks is
the Euromarkets. Why would a U.S. issuer ignore the huge
market on its own doorstep? Because it's too expensive. The
SEC's regulations were not only discouraging foreign issuers
from raising capital here but also encouraging U.S. companies
to go overseas. The large number of foreign issuers listed on
the London Stock Exchange compared with the relatively small
number listed on the New York Stock Exchange provides some
evidence of this.
   Rule 144A identifies a category of transactions involving
large institutions that do not need the protection provided
by the SEC's disclosure provisions. These are transactions
that cannot be carried out efficiently under the SEC's
existing regulatory system -- paper work and long waiting
periods slow the process up.
   There are, of course, a variety of occasions when
institutional investors must unload securities: When, for
example, the securities no longer fit in the portfolio or
when the institutions are required by law to dispose of them.
The latter often becomes the case in these days of leveraged
buyouts and frequent recapitalizations. Investment funds,
many of which are limited in the amount of non-investment
grade securities they can hold, often find they must divest
downgraded stock.
   Before the change, U.S. securities laws provided no clear
way for traders to resell private-placement securities
without registering them with the SEC, or holding them for
two years. Rule 144A says the traders may resell
private-placement securities without registration and without
a waiting period. The rule permits such transactions only in
instances where the buyer has a portfolio of $100 million or
more. From a technical point of view this is all the rule
does.
   The practical implications of Rule 144A, however, are much
broader. By providing a mechanism for privately placed
securities to be resold outside the registration process, and
without much of the legal hullabaloo and paper work that
currently accompany such transactions, the SEC authorized the
creation of a third market. In the future there will be three
types of markets in the U.S. The first is the public retail
market. The second is the established private-placement
market, in which securities are sold on a negotiated basis to
investors with whom the issuer expects to have a continuing
relationship. The new market is the Rule 144A market, in
which institutions will trade securities among themselves.
   Observers expect that this market will be competitive with
the older Euromarkets. They believe that U.S. issuers will be
able to raise capital in the private markets here as
efficiently as, and probably at lower transaction cost than,
in the Euromarkets. Foreign issuers, who are frequently
deterred from entering the U.S. public markets by the SEC's
disclosure and reporting provisions, are expected to widen
their issuances in the newly liquid U.S. private markets.
U.S. investors, whose interest in foreign securities is
growing, will benefit from easier access to these securities.
   Will the new market shut out the small investor? Reps.
Edward Markey and John Dingell have expressed concern that
the rule will result in a two-tiered market, with small
investors in the public market being frozen out of the best
deals. But Messrs. Markey and Dingell have missed the point.
A two-tiered market already exists. Large institutions can
buy in the private market securities that are not available
to small investors, and can go overseas to buy securities of
foreign issuers that are reluctant to venture into the U.S.
markets.
   It may well be the case that a few issues of securities
that would have been made in the U.S. public markets will now
be made privately. It is even possible that some of the
private issues will include issues that would have been sold
to small investors. It must be remembered, though, that many
issues of securities that appear to be offered publicly are
in fact entirely sold to institutions and are registered with
the SEC only to provide liquidity. What is far more likely,
however, is that issues that would otherwise have been made
overseas will now be attracted to this country. Many of the
players in the private market, it should be noted, are the
proxies of small investors: Pension funds and mutual funds
make up a large proportion of the participants.
   Indirectly, at least, then, the smaller investor will have
a larger market to work in. Direct foreign issuer access to
the U.S. can only serve to benefit all investors. Should we
risk this benefit to preserve the fiction of a level playing
field?
   The answer to Rep. Dingell's concern is not to retain
inefficient and unnecessary barriers to raising capital in
the private market but to improve the competitiveness of the
public market. Some obstacles are unlikely to budge soon --
excessive litigation, for example. The U.S. also has some of
the world's most burdensome disclosure requirements. Full
disclosure is necessary for a fair and efficient market, but
the SEC has come to the realization that it doesn't
necessarily have to be the exact kind of disclosure mandated
by its current rules.
   The proposal by the SEC last year of the
"Multijurisdictional Disclosure System" shows the way. That
system would permit Canadian issuers to make public offerings
in the U.S., and to comply with the SEC's continuous
disclosure requirements on the basis of documents that meet
the disclosure requirements of Canadian regulatory
authorities. If other foreign companies listed on their own
national exchanges were able to use documents approved by
their home regulators, it seems reasonable to assume that
they would be more likely to offer their securities publicly
and to small investors in this country. Rule 144A in any case
is a good step in the right direction. Critics may be right
in sensing that work remains to be done. But the change
that's needed is more Rule 144A-style flexibility -- in other
areas of U.S. securities law.
