   OTTAWA -- Canadian regulators have decided to tighten
cable television rate regulations to slow what they said was
a "spiraling" rise in cable-TV rates.
   The new rules will reduce the cable TV industry's
profitability, the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission said in its rate ruling. The
industry's annual return on net fixed assets has been
increasing steadily since the early 1980s, reaching 28.1% in
1988, the latest year for which industry figures are
available.

   "The commission had to take steps to ensure that cable TV
remains affordable," said Keith Spicer, CRTC chairman.
Canada's cable TV industry is much more closely regulated
than the U.S. cable industry, with regard to both rates and
content.
   The Canadian Cable Television Association, which
represents the Canadian cable industry, said it was
disappointed with the ruling, particularly the commission's
refusal to allow the industry to raise cable subscribers'
monthly rates in order to pass on the cost of copyright fees
for retransmission of distant TV signals.
   Since Jan. 1, Canadian cable systems have been liable to
pay such copyright fees. The amount of the royalties will be
decided by a new federal agency, the Copyright Board, which
has been holding hearings on the issue. TV producers in the
U.S. are expected to receive a substantial portion of the
copyright fees.
   The Canadian cable industry said its rates haven't risen
as sharply as claimed by its critics. After adjustment for
inflation, basic cable-TV rates increased by only 5.9%
between 1979 and 1988, the industry association said.
   Canadian cable-TV firms are permitted to recover through
automatic rate adjustments part of the rise in the consumer
price index and part of their capital spending costs.
   The new rules, however, will further limit the cable
companies' ability to pass on such costs to their customers.
   The commission said any future cable-rate increases to
recover capital expenditures would be effective for a
five-year period only.
   The federal agency also said it will commission an
independent study of new profit measures and benchmarks for
the cable industry. The commission has allowed a cable
company to earn over an eight-year period an average annual
return of up to 24%, before interest and income taxes on net
fixed assets. Mr. Spicer said the new maximum rate of return
would be less than 24%, but he wouldn't be more specific.
   The commission said it will also undertake "a major review
of the structure and cost of cable-TV service," and hold a
public hearing in mid-1991. Cable-industry officials said
they hoped this hearing would open the way for a partial
deregulation of their industry that would allow them greater
freedom to set prices for specialty services, provided they
undertook to deliver a basic package of television signals at
an affordable price.
