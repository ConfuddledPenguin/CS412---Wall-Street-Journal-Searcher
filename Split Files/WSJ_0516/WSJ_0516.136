   CHICAGO -- A Chicago Board of Trade member paid $250,000
to settle Commodity Futures Trading Commission charges that
he made a series of noncompetitive trades in 1986.
   Without admitting or denying the commission's allegations,
Keith M. Rudman, a trader in the exchange's Treasury bond
futures pit, agreed to the fine and a six-month trading
suspension. Mr. Rudman couldn't be reached for comment.

   Mr. Rudman was one of 22 Treasury bond traders charged
last year with making noncompetitive trades via a practice
known as "ginzy trading." The remaining 21 traders are the
subject of a commission hearing here this week concerning the
allegations.
   Mr. Rudman was fined $25,000 by the commission for similar
alleged violations in 1985 and was ordered to cease and
desist from making noncompetitive trades.
   In ginzy trading, exchange members profit by giving
customers two different prices for the same buy or sell
order. The effect of ginzy trading is to give a customer a
net price for a trade that falls between the quoted bid and
ask prices in a particular market.
   While some traders say the technique can result in the
customer getting a better price than under normal trading
practices, the commission maintains that ginzy trading
violates federal commodity laws banning noncompetitive or
prearranged trades.
