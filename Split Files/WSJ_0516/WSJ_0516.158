   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export Import Bank said it and the
U.S. Agency for International Development will jointly create
a $500 million pool to assist sales by U.S. exporters in
highly competitive Third World markets.
   The funds will back U.S. exports in markets where other
governments engage in "extensive, trade-distorting tied-aid
activities," the Ex-Im Bank said. "Tied-aid" is credit given
on the condition that the recipient country uses it to
purchase goods and services from the country supplying the
credit. The new U.S. lending pool will operate on the same
principle.

   The U.S. generally opposes use of tied-aid. Eugene Lawson,
the Ex-Im Bank's vice chairman, said the kitty will be used
to protect U.S. commercial interests while Washington is
attempting to negotiate a comprehensive international accord
restricting the use of tied-aid.
   The Ex-Im Bank said the markets where the funds may be
used include Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and
Thailand. Among the projects to be assisted are
telecommunications, transportation, power and construction
equipment.
   The pool will be drawn from existing Ex-Im Bank and AID
programs. Pool applicants have to meet AID's standards and
country priorities, the bank said.
