   HONG KONG -- Hong Kong manufacturers' business was hurt
during the first quarter amid diminished orders, stiffer
competition and increased costs, but improvement is expected
in the current quarter, according to a government survey.
   The study, based on interviews with approximately 1,000
concerns, found that companies in the textile, plastics and
clothing industries experienced the downturn most markedly.
But improved orders are expected for the April-June period,
particularly in the plastics, metals and appliances
industries.

   Construction companies, buoyed by the colony's continuing
building boom, reported better business conditions in the
first half and anticipate further improvement during the
current period.
   Banks and real-estate concerns reported stable business
for the first period and expect conditions to remain in place
for the remainder of the first half.
