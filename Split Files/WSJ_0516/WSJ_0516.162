   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee unanimously
approved the nomination of David Mullins to the Federal
Reserve Board.
   The nomination of Mr. Mullins, who is the assistant
Treasury secretary for domestic finance, now goes to the full
Senate.

   Mr. Mullins, a former Harvard Business School professor,
was a principal author of the Bush administration's plan to
bail out the savings-and-loan industry. Before coming to the
Treasury, he was a top staffer on a task force set up by
former President Reagan to investigate the 1987 stock market
crash.
   If approved by the Senate, Mr. Mullins would serve out the
term vacated by Robert Heller, who left the Fed last year to
become an executive vice president of Visa International, the
credit card company. The term expires in 1996.
