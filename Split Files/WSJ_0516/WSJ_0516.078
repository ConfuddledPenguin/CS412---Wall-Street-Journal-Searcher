   A federal appeals court struck down an important
bank-regulatory policy of the Federal Reserve Board, saying
the Fed doesn't have the power to force bank holding
companies to help ailing subsidiaries.
   The appeals court in New Orleans, in a case involving the
Dallas bank holding company MCorp, said the Fed overreached
its authority in asserting the so-called source of strength
doctrine. Under the doctrine, which the Fed made explicit in
regulations in 1984 and 1987, bank holding companies were
required to use their assets to aid their bank units "during
periods of financial stress or adversity."

   Banking groups hailed the decision, saying it will remove
huge potential liability that had hurt bank holding companies
trying to raise capital. "This puts shareholders of bank
holding companies on an even playing field with shareholders
of other financial institutions," said James McLaughlin, a
regulatory attorney with the American Bankers Association.
   Said Howard Cayne, a partner with Arnold &amp; Porter who
handled the case for MCorp: "The effect of this decision is
to leave the decision of whether to downstream capital into
subsidiary banks where it properly lies -- with the bank
holding company's board of directors."
   However, the decision also puts a dent in the Fed's
attempt to reduce the cost to the government from bank
failures. The estimated cost of bailing out depositors at 20
MCorp banks that failed last March is about $2 billion. A
spokesman for the Fed hadn't seen the decision and had no
comment.
   MCorp and federal regulators have been bickering over the
banking concern's holding company assets since October 1988,
when MCorp first conceded that it wouldn't be able to weather
the Texas financial collapse without some form of federal
aid.
   At that time, the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., concerned about the potential bailout cost, began
pressuring MCorp to shore up the capital of its 25 banking
subsidiaries. Invoking the source-of-strength doctrine, the
Fed asked MCorp to identify the banking units that needed
support and to specify the amount of capital it intended to
inject.
   But MCorp, which had recently amassed some $400 million by
selling its credit-card and data-processing businesses,
refused. Rather than pump money into the banks right away,
MCorp hoped to use the assets as the cornerstone of a
management-led recapitalization. Threatened with a possible
bankruptcy filing, the Fed temporarily backed off.
   But after dissident bondholders forced MCorp into Chapter
11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in March of last year -- and
after the FDIC took over all but five of MCorp's banks -- the
Fed renewed its efforts to pry money loose from the holding
company. It instituted new administrative proceedings
charging that MCorp had improperly obtained $63.7 million of
unsecured loans from two of its failed banking subsidiaries
and alleged that the company hadn't acted as a source of
strength to its remaining subsidiary banks.
   MCorp responded with the lawsuit in federal court. MCorp
currently has $482 million in holding company assets and is
trying to sell its remaining five banks.
   In the appeals court decision, Judge W. Eugene Davis said
the Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, doesn't have
the "authority to regulate the day-to-day financial soundness
of the subsidiary banks." He also said a refusal by MCorp to
transfer assets doesn't constitute an "unsafe and unsound
practice" that would give the regulators the right to order
the move.
   Many banking attorneys have long believed that the
source-of-strength doctrine would fall in a court challenge,
and the Fed has only rarely used the policy explicitly. But
the threat of the policy has provided useful leverage against
banks that didn't want to challenge the Fed. "It's been
lurking," said Mr. McLaughlin of the ABA.
   Congress and the Bush administration considered writing
the source-of-strength policy into law last year during
deliberations on the bill that overhauled regulation of the
thrift and banking industries. But they rejected that and
passed a provision under which subsidiary banks -- but not
the holding company -- must help the government bail out
other troubled subsidiaries.
