   New York -- Sinead O'Connor is something else. With her
shorn skull and immense eyes, the young Irish singer who's
been topping the album and singles charts has a
tough-but-tender look unique in pop. Her voice is very
different too, an emotional seismograph capable of shifting
instantly from whisper to scream. And so, it seems, are
O'Connor's notions of performance, as she is demonstrating on
her current U.S. tour.
   From the start, this Dublin native has stood out from the
pack. Her arresting debut album "The Lion and the Cobra"
(Chrysalis), released three years ago when she was 20, had an
elemental intensity. The songs, most of which O'Connor wrote
and produced, burned with all the anger, pain and yearning of
her Dickensian-sounding adolescence.

   O'Connor's vocal fireworks were matched by her musical
daring. She boldly mixed styles ranging from Celtic folk to
symphonic to hip hop -- sometimes within a single composition
-- for a sound as stirring and unpredictable as the passions,
obsessions and betrayals of which she sang. Occasionally the
results were excessive, but never boring.
   Her new album, "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"
(Chrysalis), is another story. As the title suggests, this is
a more sober document, the statement of an artist who says
she's found serenity (in interviews she credits domestic
bliss, particularly her recent marriage to the father of her
toddler son). O'Connor's themes have stayed pretty much the
same, if expressed in more confessional terms, but her music
has contracted, muted.
   Except for the odd three-chord rocker, "I Do Not Want"
tends toward folkish hum-and-strum numbers that run no risk
of waking the baby. Or startling the listener. Lyrically
O'Connor cuts to the quick. But musically not much happens
and, at a lengthy five minutes per track, it sounds like even
less.
   It definitely doesn't sound like blockbuster stuff. But
there's a wild card here -- the one song O'Connor didn't
write (Prince did). Called "Nothing Compares 2 U," it's a
torchy lament of lost love. The only thing more wrenching
than the ache with which O'Connor sings the ballad is the way
she looks in the accompanying video. All eyes, she's caught
in tight close-up like a deer frozen by headlights. To resist
her appeal would be like killing Bambi.
   And so it was that O'Connor arrived here last week for two
sold-out shows with the No. 1 album and single in the
country, the hot ticket. Scalpers trolled the blocks around
the Beacon Theatre. Inside the standing-room-only crowd
buzzed expectantly. When the curtain finally rose, revealing
a solitary figure in a cross of light, the audience exploded.
   With her broad-shouldered biker jacket and tight pants,
O'Connor looked like an Oscar statuette. She stood as still
as one while the whoops and shrieks continued, drowning out
what she was singing. Eventually you could make out the words
to the new album's keynote song, "Feel So Different,"
O'Connor's declaration of maturity, and the string sounds
swelling from an unseen synthesizer. But all it took was the
tiniest flutter of her hands -- or voice -- for the crowd to
erupt again.
   They roared at the end of the song when O'Connor doffed
the black snood she'd been wearing, exposing her shaved pate.
She said something indistinguishable. Then she and the
now-visible five-piece band kicked into the chugging riffs of
"The Emperor's New Clothes." The group seemed to energize if
not animate her. Though O'Connor remained as poker-faced as
during the opening number, while the song crested she hopped
like a sparrow -- to the audience's delight.
   Then a percussion rat-a-tat signaled the start of "I Want
Your (Hands on Me)," the first album's dance club hit,
bringing the crowd to its feet. In the eerie purple and green
lighting, O'Connor stripped down to a black bustier. The band
pumped. She sang strongly, giving an edge of menace to her
invitation, but she moved as if in a trance. Footlights threw
her looming shadow against the back of the stage. When she
ran her hands over her thin frame, dipping down to her
crotch, the effect was less erotic than macabre.
   Next it was back to the new album for "You Cause as Much
Sorrow." As the band played the piano-embellished folk tune,
O'Connor accompanied herself with the by-now familiar hand
flutters and arm flaps. Unusual in their own right -- a
spastic hula came to mind -- O'Connor's otherwise zombielike
demeanor made them seem truly bizarre. It was as if the
intensity of O'Connor's singing had drained the life from her
body, leaving only a spasmodically jerking shell.
   Before the end of the song O'Connor walked offstage. She
returned with an acoustic guitar and began to strum "Three
Babies." As a guitar player she proved a good singer, but at
least the instrument gave her someplace to put her hands.
   Alone except for a backup guitarist, O'Connor continued
with more of the new album's chamber music. The fans, though,
seemed on a different frequency. They cheered and whooped
intermittently for no apparent reason, in the vocal
equivalent of a wave. Their high spirits were particularly
ill-timed; the tune was O'Connor's indictment of racism in
England, "Black Boys on Mopeds." But maybe they couldn't
tell. In the barebones folkie arrangement, it didn't sound
all that different from the preceding song -- or from other
new numbers.
   Fortunately the pace picked up with "Jackie," a keening
lament from the first album, and "I Am Stretched on Your
Grave," a newer lament that O'Connor ended by executing a
brisk jig. The return of the excellent but underutilized band
turned up the intensity another notch for the Big Hit, which
O'Connor gave a suitably big-voiced rendition.
   To forestall any letdown, she followed "Nothing Compares"
with a triple play of spirited material. First came the rocky
"Jump in the River," then the ominous "Jerusalem" and finally
the guitar-powered "Mandinka," as close to a traditional pop
song as she has written.
   With a "Thank you very much, good night," O'Connor and the
band were off the stage. But the fans weren't buying it. They
bellowed loudly, held aloft lit matches and didn't budge.
   In a few minutes blue lights washed over the stage and
O'Connor was back, accompanied only by her guitar. Cheers
greeted the opening of "Troy." Even without the roiling
symphonic accompaniment she gave it on the first album, this
invective against a faithless lover is one of O'Connor's
angriest songs, almost thrilling in its vehemence. As she
stormed through it, her growls and howls were matched by the
crowd. The tension built, and built some more. Finally,
bansheelike, she screeched, "You're still a liar]"
   And then she was gone.
