   FREMONT, Calif. -- VeloBind Inc. settled its patent
infringement action brought against Southwest Plastic Binding
Co. last year in the U.S. District Court for Missouri's
Eastern District, the two companies said.
   As part of the settlement, Southwest, based in St. Louis,
Mo., admitted that VeloBind's binding strip patent is valid
and that Southwest's binding strips infringed on VeloBind's
patent, the companies said.
