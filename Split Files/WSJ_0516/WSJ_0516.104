   DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built cars and trucks
dropped 8.4% in early May, damping hopes that the auto
industry's year-long malaise will end soon.
   Americans bought 301,030 North American-made cars and
trucks in the first 10 days of the month, compared with
328,719 vehicles a year earlier. On a seasonally adjusted
basis, the sales stumbled to a 6.4 million-vehicle annual
rate compared with a 7.4 million clip a year earlier and a
7.1 million selling rate in late April.

   The sales stagnation deeply disappointed car dealers, who
had hoped to get at least a few weeks of good sales out of
the traditionally strong spring season. Instead, the
generally weak results throughout this spring have caused
many dealers to cut new car orders and hunker down for an
uncertain next several months.
   "I'm not betting on anything big happening soon," said
Carlo Merlo, owner of Glendale Chrysler-Plymouth in Glendale,
Mo. "It's a mediocre market."
   As it has in recent periods, Chrysler Corp. posted the
largest sales decline among the Big Three auto makers.
Chrysler's total vehicle sales fell 21.3% from a year earlier
due to a 23% drop in domestic car sales. So far, at least,
Chrysler's aggressive advertising campaign comparing its cars
to those of Honda Motor Co. isn't drawing customers back into
Chrysler showrooms.
   Not that Ford Motor Co. fared much better. The No. 2 auto
maker saw its total vehicle sales in early May fall 15.4%,
with domestic car sales decreasing 19.8%.
   Ford officials blamed the shortfall on slightly reduced
incentive programs that pulled some May sales into April.
Ford also said it hadn't seen the benefit in early May from
the launch of the redesigned 1991 Ford Escort subcompact car.
Ford's biggest gainer: the recently redesigned Lincoln Town
Car, sales of which jumped 81.1% in early May.
   General Motors Corp. fared the best, by far, among the Big
Three, although its total vehicle sales fell 9.2%, slightly
more than the industry overall. GM continued to benefit from
surging sales of the Geo line of import and joint-venture
cars sold by Chevrolet dealers. Sales of the sporty Geo
Storm, built by Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan, jumped 37.6%;
sales of the Geo Prizm, built at the New United Motors
Manufacturing Inc. plant in California that GM runs with
Toyota Motor Corp., increased 41.3%
   Geo's gains, however, were offset by declines at GM's
Pontiac, Buick, Oldsmobile and Cadillac divisions. Each model
in the Pontiac lineup had lower sales than a year ago.
   Sales of the cars and trucks that Japanese auto makers
build in North America increased significantly. The gain
reflects increased production schedules by some companies and
solid sales gains by more established Japanese makers in the
U.S., such as Honda.
   Honda said its domestic car sales rose 32.3% to 11,238 in
early May. Nissan Motor Co., which has also built vehicles in
the U.S. for several years, said its total domestic vehicle
sales increased 42.6%
   Analysts said the continued soft sales of the Big Three
show the saturation of new cars on U.S. streets. "The U.S.
auto industry is now the victim of its own prosperity," said
David Healy, auto analyst with Barclays BZW investment
banking group in New York. "The number of late model vehicles
is now at an all-time high."
   "Look around at the stop lights," echoed Hoot McInerney,
who owns nine dealerships in Michigan and Florida. "The
rusted out cars are gone. Everyone's got something shiny and
new and it'll be a long time before they come into
showrooms."
   The bright spot on the horizon: Hopes for reduced interest
rates in the near future will stir buyer interest like it has
the stock market.
