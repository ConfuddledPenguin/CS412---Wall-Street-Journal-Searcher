   Boulevard Bancorp Inc. said it will take a $650,000 charge
against its second-quarter earnings as a result of a 10%
reduction in its work force.
   The Chicago-based bank holding company, which has assets
of $1.7 billion, has about 865 employees.

   Boulevard said the reduction is one of several actions it
is taking to improve long-term profitability and shareholder
returns. The company said it expects the measures to result
in annual savings of between $2 million to $2.5 million.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Boulevard earned $2.5
million, or 39 cents a share.
