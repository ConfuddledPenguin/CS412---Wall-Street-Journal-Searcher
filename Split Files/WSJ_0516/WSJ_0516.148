   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. of New York is the first non-Italian
bank to be named a primary dealer in Italian government
securities. Morgan received final approval from the Bank of
Italy and will begin quoting prices today on the screen-based
trading system for the secondary bond market.
   Daily turnover on the regulated market, in which liquidity
is estimated to have doubled in the past year, is about 1.4
trillion lire ($1.16 billion), according to banking sources,
while over-the-counter volume has been estimated around four
trillion lire, though exact figures aren't available.

   Hundreds of banks, including other foreign banks, deal in
the secondary market, but Morgan is one of 20 authorized by
the Bank of Italy to quote bid and offer prices continuously
for Italy's government paper. These banks meet minimum
capital requirements set by the central bank.
   Morgan said it believes the Italian market holds
unrecognized potential for international investors. It cited
high yields, new confidence in the lira, and Italy's
liberalization of foreign exchange barriers.
