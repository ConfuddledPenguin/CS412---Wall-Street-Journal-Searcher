   WASHINGTON -- Government officials alleged that defense
contractor James Guerin masterminded a scheme to create more
than $1 billion of fake weapons contracts to defraud banks,
companies and untold numbers of investors around the world.
   In documents and sworn testimony, government agents
alleged that Mr. Guerin, along with a group of associates,
used a host of phony front companies, fraudulent profit
reports and 39 bank accounts in Switzerland and the U.S. to
carry out their scheme over a 12-year period.

   In Philadelphia federal court, Amy Zelnik, an Internal
Revenue Service agent, said Mr. Guerin "directed" the scheme
that defrauded a large British defense electronics company,
Ferranti International PLC, and forced it last year to write
off $365 million, or almost half its net worth.
   Mr. Guerin, who was profiled in a front page Wall Street
Journal story in January, hasn't been formally charged and
has denied violating any law. But he has been discussing a
plea bargain with federal prosecutors, according to people
familiar with the talks. Moreover, one of the companies he
controlled, Parent Industries Inc., agreed to plead guilty to
a federal racketeering charge and agreed to pay the
government $4.4 million. Mr. Guerin's attorney, Joseph Tate
of Philadelphia, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Guerin has been under investigation by prosecutors and
a task force of investigators for more than two years. The
court testimony and filings mark the first time that the
government laid out some of the evidence it has accumulated
againt Mr. Guerin, once a revered figure in Lancaster, Pa.
   Mr. Guerin built a backyard business, International Signal
&amp; Control, into a global conglomerate. His troubles, however,
surfaced after he sold International Signal to Ferranti in
1988 and internal auditors began questioning the legitimacy
of some of his largest contracts.
   Federal prosecutors and agents charged that Mr. Guerin and
the other alleged conspirators concocted contracts with
Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and various South African
customers.
   In an affidavit, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent
alleged that Mr. Guerin and his associates hid their actions
through a maze of bank accounts and phony customers before
and after the sale to Ferranti. The affidavit indicated that
the government had obtained the cooperation of Mr. Guerin's
former chief financial officer, Robert Shireman.
   "The losses to victims of the fraud are extensive," the
FBI affidavit said. Moreover, a federal prosecutor, Robert
Goldman, said after yesterday's hearing that the evidence
presented to the court showed that stockholders of
International Signal and later Ferranti were defrauded. He
added that Ferranti, primary victim of the scheme, relied on
"fictitious" financial statements in acquiring International
Signal.
   Ferranti has filed civil suits againt Mr. Guerin and
others seeking $600 million in damages, according to the
government.
   In painting a picture of intrigue inside Mr. Guerin's
corporate empire, the government indicated that Mr. Guerin's
former general counsel, William Clark, had threatened to
disclose his superior's questionable activities. Prosecutors
went into court to block Mr. Clark's efforts to obtain a $2
million severance payment from Mr. Guerin. The government
alleged that Mr. Clark used "blackmail" to obtain the
agreement. Mr. Clark, who has previously denied acting
illegally, declined to comment.
   The government didn't provide any details on one important
facet of its inquiry: allegations that Mr. Guerin smuggled
navigational technology for fighter planes and electronics
parts to South Africa, where he began doing business in the
1970s.
