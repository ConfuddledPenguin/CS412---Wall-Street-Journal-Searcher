   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- When a powerful group of U.S. textile
manufacturers invited White House Trade Representative Carla
Hills to speak at their annual meeting here, they promised to
treat her "like a queen."
   "Which queen?" Ambassador Hills asked upon her arrival.
"Mary Queen of Scots? Marie Antoinette?"

   Both monarchs, of course, were beheaded, and Mrs. Hills
has reason to think the textile industry may be planning a
similar fate for her. She has staked the Bush
administration's trade policy, as well as her own success as
trade representative, on the so-called Uruguay round of talks
under the international trade treaty known as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But the textile industry,
with its powerful ties to Congress, could ruin those plans.
   There's a lot at stake here. The Bush administration has
said its "top trade priority" is the completion of the
multilateral trade talks, which it hopes will help open
foreign markets, especially in areas not previously covered
by GATT, such as services, investment, intellectual property,
agriculture and textiles.
   Mrs. Hills and her counterparts from almost 100 other
nations in the GATT talks are committed to eliminating the
need for special trade rules for textiles and replacing the
29-year-old Multi-Fiber Arrangement, a complex set of quotas
among the main textile consuming and producing nations. The
resulting freer trade in textiles would offer greater
opportunities to the more competitive U.S. companies and
reduce prices for U.S. consumers, but it would also result in
some less-competitive companies having to adjust or fail.
   But the trade treaty, scheduled to be completed in
December, must eventually be approved by the Senate, and
there the textile industry has the upper hand. Its
saber-rattling political backers are claiming they already
have the power to block any trade treaty they don't like. As
a result, Mrs. Hills may be forced to back down from her
free-trade stance. She has tried to be conciliatory, even
proposing a 10-year transition period while the U.S. abandons
its current textile quotas.
   In the meantime, the industry's allies on Capitol Hill are
trying to seize the high ground. Led by Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D., S.C.), they submitted a bill in early April "to provide
for orderly imports of textiles, apparel and footwear," which
would significantly increase protection for the textile
industry.
   Claiming that "the very survival of the U.S. textile
industry is at stake," Sen. Hollings called in his bill for a
maximum 1% annual growth in textile imports and an
import-licensing program. It has garnered huge support,
attracting the backing of 54 senators and 230 members of the
House.
   Just days before the bill was proposed, Ambassador Hills
sent an unusual plea to members of Congress, asking that such
a bill not be introduced. "The introduction of legislation
might be counterproductive to our efforts," and could
polarize positions, she wrote. Such legislation "will
antagonize our trading partners" and force them to take "a
more rigid stance in negotiations or enact protectionist
legislation themselves," Mrs. Hills said. But her request was
ignored.
   Moreover, Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) is saying he will do
all he can to oppose a GATT agreement unless it includes a
global quota on textile and apparel imports with an annual
rate of increase tied to domestic market growth.
   Domestic deadlock on textiles could potentially stymie the
whole GATT round, and the industry is doing all it can to
stress its strength. "We haven't gone to the full-court press
yet," says Donald Hughes, first vice president of Burlington
Mills and new president of the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute, discussing Congress's support for the textile
bill. The institute's membership accounts for about 75% of
all textile fibers consumed in the nation.
   Textiles are "crucial to the GATT round," says William
Brock, a former U.S. trade representative who now runs his
own international consulting firm. The developing countries,
"almost as one, see textiles and agriculture as the way they
evaluate the talks. If we fail to make progress in both
areas, they won't play and that means no round."
   Indonesia, Bangladesh, Mexico, India and a host of other
developing countries are clamoring for better access to
Western markets for their textiles. They see this as a trade
for opening up their markets to Western services, investment
and intellectual property.
   "Textiles and agriculture seem to be the two areas that
are potential deal-makers or deal-breakers," for the GATT
round, says William Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute
for International Economics who is currently preparing a new
study of the textile industry.
   Mr. Cline estimates that protection of the industry now
costs the U.S. $25 billion a year, or $238 for every U.S.
family. If the textile industry's bill is adopted -- with its
1%-a-year allowable growth in quotas -- the costs of
protection would rise to about $85 billion a year in the year
2000, he estimates.
   Many expect compromise and a transition period that
effectively allows textile protection to tighten. It remains
to be seen "if the administration is prepared to commit to
liberalization and whether the transition will be credible,"
says Mr. Cline. Just to keep protection from tightening as
the market expands, current textile quotas should grow about
7% a year, he estimates.
   The Bush administration, however, holds some strong cards
in the struggle to try to bring the textile industry under
the GATT for the first time since 1961. The apparel industry
for once isn't solidly behind its cousin the textile
industry. The American Apparel Manufacturers didn't endorse
the Hollings bill, although it endorsed similar bills
proposed in the Reagan administration and before.
   Second, Mr. Bush is the first president since Dwight
Eisenhower to come to office without having made pledges to
the textile industry. His campaign for the Republican
nomination deliberately avoided them: In the South Carolina
presidential primary, his opponent Robert Dole championed the
textile industry's protectionist goals, but Mr. Bush shunned
them and triumphed.
   Third, even though Congress may pass the new textile bill,
the President is likely to veto it and the textile caucus in
Congress probably doesn't have the two-thirds majority
required to override him. Ronald Reagan twice vetoed similar
bills and on both occasions Congress narrowly failed to
muster the votes for an override. "That bill won't pass and
they know it," says Mr. Brock, who terms the proposed
legislation "a continuing effort to send a shot across the
bow" of the White House Trade Office.
   There are also obvious inconsistencies in the textile
industry's approach to trade policy that are likely to become
more apparent. It is ironic, for instance, that the textile
industry ardently favors open trade when it comes to
duty-free access for foreign textile machinery.
   The industry also isn't in bad shape, contrary to its
claims. In fact, industry shipments of man-made fibers
increased 17.8% between 1987 and 1989, while exports of these
same items jumped 59%, according to the Commerce Department.
And in 1989 the industry had after-tax profit of $1.32
billion, which represented 2.5% of net sales and a 10.3%
return on equity.
   As an internal Bush administration memo says, "The
industry always seeks to maneuver its situation into one
which implies that declining market share, poor financial
performance or any decline in employment is adequate
justification for increased protection."
   The industry's campaign is certainly crafted to play on
people's fears of an ailing national textile business. The
new textile act "is essential to halt further erosion of this
major American industry," says the manufacturers association.
The U.S. textile industry is paying the price for a foreign
policy "that gives our market to foreigners," says Sen.
Helms. U.S. entrepreneurs are taking their expertise overseas
because "they are denied the help of their government in the
international trade competition," says Sen. Hollings.
   Retailers, people in the apparel industry and free-trade
advocates hope that the Bush administration will face down
the textile industry. The ability to destroy the GATT round
is "clearly the underlying threat (the textile industry) is
trying to portray," says Joseph O'Neill, president of the
National Retail Federation, which is seeking freer trade in
textiles. "I'd hope textiles wouldn't be given such an
inordinate amount of leverage."
