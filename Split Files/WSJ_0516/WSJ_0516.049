   TOKYO -- Japanese manufacturers received machinery orders
totaling 3.034 trillion yen ($19.9 billion) in March, up an
unadjusted 7.9% from the previous year, the Economic Planning
Agency said.
   The gain followed a 29% year-on-year increase in February.

   An agency official said machinery orders remain in an
upward trend, and added that March's rise was in line with
expectations. Orders have been rising since October 1988 with
the exception of December 1989.
   After seasonal adjustment, orders in March fell 14% from
the previous month to 1.758 trillion yen.
   Machinery orders to Japanese companies rose 16% to 21.863
trillion yen in fiscal 1989 from the previous fiscal year,
according to the agency.
