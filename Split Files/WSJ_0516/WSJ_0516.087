   China canceled plans to spend $256.8 million to modernize
Chinese jet fighters with electronic fire-control systems
built by Grumman Corp., the Pentagon said.
   Grumman, of Bethpage, N.Y., has performed development work
on the systems under a $245 million contract since 1987.
Following the development work, scheduled for completion this
year, Grumman expected China to execute a production option
to have the systems delivered for installation by the Chinese
in their F-8 II jet fighters. The program would have been the
biggest U.S. military sale to China.

   The contract's future became clouded last year after the
Bush administration suspended military sales to China after
the Beijing government crushed that country's pro-democracy
movement. Production of the hardware could have proceeded
under the suspension although delivery of the systems would
have been withheld until the measure was lifted, according to
a Defense Department spokesman.
   In Washington, spokesmen at the Chinese embassy didn't
return calls to comment on the decision to forego production
of the Grumman equipment.
   For Grumman, the decision was the latest in a series of
blows to its military-aircraft business as defense spending
in this country takes its toll on the company's programs. A
Grumman spokeswoman said the Chinese decision will add to the
pressure for more layoffs. The spokeswoman said Grumman has
about 180 employees working on the development phase of the
Chinese contract.
   Under the production phase of the contract, Grumman would
have produced electronics packages for 55 F-8 II aircraft
consisting of fire-control systems made up of radar,
computers, display and other gear. The systems were to be
delivered to China for installation on new planes at
Shengyang Aircraft Co.
   The F-8 II is a single-seat, twin-engined interceptor
based on the Soviet MiG-21, Grumman said.
   Grumman received the Chinese contract under the Reagan
administration's generally liberal policies toward China.
Although Grumman was to supply equipment and services to the
Chinese, the Air Force was to be the official vendor under
the terms of a foreign military-sales arrangement with China.
   When the Bush administration suspended military sales to
China in June, the U.S. also expelled 40 Chinese working on
the Grumman development program in Bethpage. The
administration allowed the Chinese to return in October and
since then there have been about 24 Chinese nationals working
at Grumman, the company said.
   The F-8 II systems work is the second Chinese project
Grumman has lost during the past year. U.S. restrictions on
sales to China last year put an end to a Grumman program
announced in 1988 in which the company was to conduct a
preliminary study with China on upgrading the Chinese F-7M
fighter aircraft for sale in international markets. The study
was to determine the feasibility of an improved aircraft that
could be sold for approximately $10 million each.
