   NEW YORK -- The trust set up by Manville Corp. to pay
asbestos victims' claims came under fire in an unusual
federal-state proceeding as two judges ordered the trust to
account for its enormous shortfall in funds.
   U.S. district Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York state
court Justice Helen Freedman also raised the possibility that
they may order drastic measures to ensure that the trust and
Manville more rapidly pay damages to asbestos victims.

   The two judges, in a joint memorandum, said these steps
could include requiring Manville to pay additional funding to
the trust and opening the company up to new asbestos
lawsuits. Currently, only the trust, which was formed in 1988
as part of the company's bankruptcy-court reorganization, can
be sued.
   Maryanna Smith, executive director of the trust, said the
trust and Manville believe that many of the judges'
suggestions are unlikely to be adopted and may be barred
under bankruptcy law. She said the trust's attorneys believe
that the company's funding can't be changed.
   A spokesman for the company said it believes no changes
are warranted in the plan that set up the trust. "The plan .
. . was well thought out and resolved through the judicial
process. There's no basis for changing it," he said.
   Manville also issued a statement saying that if the ban on
lawsuits against the company were lifted, the trust's assets
would be hurt. "If the injunction weren't in place, it could
dramatically reduce the value of all assets provided to the
trust, including the value of trust stock," it said.
   The judges' harsh criticism of the Manville trust came at
the end of a hearing on efforts to settle about 500 asbestos
cases involving workers from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The
Manville trust is one of the major defendants in the
settlement effort, which is being overseen by Kenneth
Feinberg. The two judges appointed Mr. Feinberg, of Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, as special master in
January to come up with a settlement of the state and federal
cases.
   Mr. Feinberg advised the judges on the settlement
negotiations, which he said are making good progress. He said
the defendants, all former makers of asbestos, which causes
respiratory ailments, had been notified of the amounts he
expects each to pay. He said the defendants are expected to
respond within the next few days as the settlement talks near
a May 30 deadline set by the judges last January.
   But Mr. Feinberg said one problem that has emerged is the
lengthy delay in getting any payments from the Manville
trust. The trust recently told plaintiffs' attorneys that
cases settled now won't receive their first payments until
the year 2004. Because of that delay, plaintiffs' attorneys
don't want the trust included in the settlement.
   After the hearing, held in state supreme court in
Manhattan with both judges presiding, Mr. Feinberg said, "I
remain optimistic that even without the Manville trust's
participation we can work out a settlement of the Brooklyn
Navy Yard cases involving all the other defendants."
   The judges, however, appear determined to include the
Manville lawsuits in the settlement. "It isn't satisfactory,
from both courts' points of view, to leave Manville out of
it," Judge Weinstein said. "We want these cases settled."
   The judges, in a memorandum issued after the hearing,
listed several possible steps that it said could be
considered against the Manville trust. It also ordered the
trust to turn over details about its assets, administrative
expenses, legal fees, projected payments to plaintiffs and an
explanation of why it currently can't pay damages.
   "If the defendants (in the Manville cases) claim
insufficient funds, there may be a fiduciary relationship
requiring an inquiry into what the parties and insurers have
been doing to maximize payments to the injured," the judges
said.
   Ms. Smith said all of the material requested by the two
judges is included in the trust's regular reports to the
federal bankruptcy court that oversaw the Manville case.
   The judges said they may have the power to appoint a
receiver for enough of the trust's assets to cover Manville's
share of the Brooklyn Navy Yard cases. They also asked the
trust to explain why interest shouldn't be collected on
claims that won't be paid for several years, hinting that
interest could be required as part of a judgment.
   Another possibility, the judges said, would be for the
federal bankruptcy court to lift its injunction barring new
asbestos lawsuits against the company. Because ailments
allegedly caused by asbestos take years to appear, new cases
are still being filed. And the judges said the trust could go
back to the federal bankruptcy court and ask that the company
provide more of its profits as funding.
   The trust has assets of about $2.5 billion, mainly
Manville stock. But it says it can afford to pay only about
$250 million in claims this year and has already paid more
than $26 million. The company is to contribute its first $75
million annual payment in August 1991 and will start
contributing 20% of its profit in 1992.
   Ms. Smith said that the shortfall in paying claims was
anticipated when the trust was formed. But she said the
shortfall had come sooner than expected because the trust has
settled more cases and paid more money than projected.
