   HOUSTON -- Galveston-Houston Co. said it hired Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. and Simmons &amp; Co. International to formulate a
plan to enhance shareholder value.
   In April, the company said its chairman, president and
chief executive officer, Nathan M. Avery, would resign to
assume a post with the Commerce Department, and that it would
hire advisers to help determine the best course of action.
Galveston-Houston manufactures oil and natural gas drilling
and production equipment.

   A spokesman said options include hiring a new chief
executive, possible mergers and acquisitions and the sale of
all or parts of the company. He stressed that no decisions
have been made and that the investment bankers haven't yet
completed a review of the company.
