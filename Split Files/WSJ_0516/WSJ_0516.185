   NEW YORK -- Wilfred American Educational Corp., the
beauty-school operator that on Monday sought protection under
the bankruptcy laws, listed in its petition assets totaling
nearly twice liabilities before stockholder equity.
   Of the $22.7 million of assets at March 31, $15.3 million
are listed as "intercompany receivables," funds owed to
Wilfred units by other units. Wilfred's $11.9 million of
liabilities before stockholder equity include $2.5 million of
current-maturity long-term debt.

   Wilfred's largest creditor is the Philadelphia National
Bank unit of CoreStates Financial Corp., which is owed more
than $2.2 million, the petition says.
   The petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan,
says the company was pinched by "certain cash-flow problems,
difficulties in obtaining adequate financing," and litigation
and disputes tied to the company's participation in federal
student-aid programs.
   Wilfred, which has been in business for more than 70
years, derives much of its revenue from reimbursements under
such aid programs. The company operates more than 20
cosmetology and business schools. Ten Wilfred subsidiaries
also filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence Abram yesterday entered
orders allowing Wilfred to, among other things, continue to
use its bank accounts, pay pre-filing wages and expenses, and
operate and manage the schools, said William F. Gray Jr.,
attorney for Wilfred at the law firm Webster &amp; Sheffield.
   On Monday, Wilfred said that it settled a dispute with the
U.S. Education Department, agreeing to accept nearly $2.9
million for reimbursement claims that totaled nearly $8
million. Wilfred said it settled to meet its cash needs and
to avoid the expense of litigation.
