   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. introduced
a computer workstation priced at $4,995, setting a new
standard for high-powered desktop computing at relatively low
prices.
   Sun's new computer, called the Sparcstation SLC, is likely
to cement Sun's lead in the workstation market, one of the
fastest-growing segments of the computer industry. While
Sun's chief competitors in workstations, Hewlett-Packard Inc.
and Digital Equipment Corp., vow to introduce similarly
priced but more powerful workstations, some analysts think
Sun's new machine will confound competitors for many months.

   "This makes it difficult for DEC and HP to keep up with
Sun in the workstation business," said Vicki Brown, an
analysts at International Data Corp.
   Sun declined to estimate future sales of the machine,
though it said it had already received orders for 5,000
units.
   However, Ms. Brown said Sun's newest computer is expected
to lift sales of its year-old Sparcstation family
significantly. She said sales of all three models, including
the SLC, will probably total 95,000 units this year, roughly
three times last year's sales.
   Besides helping Sun satisfy its traditional engineering
and scientific customers, the new machine will add momentum
to the company's assault on the market for personal
computers, generally used by white collar workers.
   "The battle today is on the desktop," said Scott McNealy,
Sun's chief executive officer, referring to the company's
plans to butt heads with such PC makers as Apple Computer
Inc.
   While Sun may steal some PC sales, the new SLC lacks a
hard-disk drive, the basic storage device for PCs, and it
can't be upgraded with accessories that improve performance.
   But the machine operates at blazing speeds -- 12.5 million
operations a second -- because it has at its heart Sun's own
Sparc microprocessor. The extra speed is useful in, for
instance, financial modeling or electronic publishing, where
PCs often lack the horsepower to carry out complex tasks.
   Sun is expected to introduce an even faster Sparcstation
before the end of the year, putting further pressure on
competitors. That machine might even share the same packaging
as the SLC, which is designed so that its circuitry shares
the same housing as its 17-inch monitor.
   The packaging is crucial to Sun's profit margins on the
computer, which may sell for as little as $3,000 when
purchased in large quantities. Ms. Brown said Sun spent $1
million on tooling for the computer and managed to design the
machine without a fan, which reduces the computer's noise and
manufacturing costs.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun shares
closed at $29.25 apiece, down $1.25 on heavy volume of about
1.9 million shares.
