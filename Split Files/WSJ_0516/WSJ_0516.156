   LOS ANGELES -- Management Co. Entertainment Group Inc.
said it agreed in principle with Kidder, Peabody Group Inc.
for the General Electric Co. unit to restructure its $72.5
million bridge loan in exchange for as much as a 28% stake in
MCEG, a financially troubled motion-picture producer and
distributor.
   MCEG said Kidder agreed to replace the loan MCEG used to
acquire Virgin Vision Ltd. last August with $55 million of
two-year notes and $17.5 million of five-year notes. The loan
was initially due May 29.

   In return, MCEG will issue warrants or convertible bonds
to Kidder, allowing the New York investment banking firm to
buy 12 million of its common shares for $3 each. MCEG said
Kidder will receive warrants to purchase an additional eight
million shares at $3 each if the company hasn't repaid the
five-year notes by Dec. 31.
   The arrangement could give Kidder a stake of as much as
28% in the company, MCEG said, assuming it had 64 million
shares outstanding at year end on a fully diluted basis.
   The financing arrangement is subject to a number of
significant conditions, including approval by MCEG's board.
   MCEG shares were quoted at $2.8125, bid, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday.
