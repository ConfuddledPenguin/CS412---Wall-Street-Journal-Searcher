   TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp. said it will introduce an
"electronic book" system that uses a palm-sized player for
reading books recorded on three-inch compact disks.
   Sony said its "Data Discman" player has a screen that
displays text recorded on CDs, called Electronic Books, that
can store about 100,000 pages of text each, or more than 300
paperback books.

   "The purpose of this product is to create an entirely new
market. Instead of having to go to a library or bookshelf for
information, people can have access to it anytime and
anywhere," said Sunobu Horigome, head of Sony's General Audio
Group.
   He said Sony hopes the product will create a "new culture"
and approach to information access, with an impact similar to
its Walkman portable stereos.
   Sony said it plans to begin marketing the machine in Japan
in July for about $380. Overseas sales are expected to begin
in less than a year, after arrangements with local publishers
are made, officials said.
