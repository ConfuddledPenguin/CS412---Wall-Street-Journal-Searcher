   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- The Hoover Institution, the
conservative think tank at Stanford University, named John
Raisian as its new director.
   Mr. Raisian, 40 years old, succeeds W. Glenn Campbell, who
held the post from 1960 to 1989. Mr. Raisian is an economist
who has served as Hoover's acting director since September
and became the front-runner for the post after Michael
Boskin, the first choice, withdrew himself from consideration
in February. Mr. Boskin heads President Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers.

   During his stint as acting director, Mr. Raisian has been
credited with defusing tensions -- years in the making --
between Hoover and Stanford's faculty over what some say are
Hoover's ideologically driven research activities.
   Despite the institution's widely viewed reputation for a
conservative bias, Mr. Raisian said, "I have tried to take my
case to the university: We do not have a mission or a point
of view." He added that his efforts "are paying dividends"
among Stanford faculty and that in the future he expects
Hoover's resident fellows, who include such influential
conservatives as economist Milton Friedman and physicist
Edward Teller, to have more involvement with Stanford
students.
