   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ordered Price Waterhouse to
give a partnership to a woman who was denied the opportunity
seven years ago and whose sex-discrimination lawsuit went to
the Supreme Court.
   Judge Gerhard Gesell ordered the accounting firm to make
Ann Hopkins a partner, effective July 1, and to pay her back
pay and interest from 1983 that her lawyers say will total
about $350,000.

   Ms. Hopkins, who works at the World Bank, charged that
Price Waterhouse denied her a partnership because of sex
stereotyping -- some partners thought she was too aggressive
and were offended by her use of profanity.
   Last May, the Supreme Court ruled that discrimination
based on sexual stereotypes is prohibited by Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act. The high court concluded that the
federal district court had applied the correct legal standard
at the trial but sent the case back so the court could decide
how to correct the illegal actions by Price Waterhouse.
   Judge Gesell, in a 33-page opinion, concluded that the
firm should make Ms. Hopkins a partner, an offer that her
lawyers say she is inclined to accept, if it is made.
   Price Waterhouse said it is was studying the decision. The
firm wouldn't say whether it would accept the decision or
appeal again.
