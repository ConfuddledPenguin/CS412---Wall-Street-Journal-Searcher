   Tiffany &amp; Co., a New York-based retailer of fine gifts and
jewelry, reported net income for its first quarter ended
April 30 rose 29% to $5.4 million, or 35 cents a share, from
$4.2 million, a 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales increased 27% to $93.2 million from $73.2 million.
Year-earlier share net is adjusted to reflect a 3-for-2 stock
split paid in July 1989.

   Tiffany's international retail sales more than doubled,
mainly because of strong demand in Asia and Europe, the
company said. But U.S. retail sales remained roughly flat,
"which we believe reflected consumer caution in certain
regions of the U.S.," Tiffany Chairman William R. Chaney
said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Tiffany shares closed at $43.25, up $1.
