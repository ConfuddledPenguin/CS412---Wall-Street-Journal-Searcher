   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's consumer prices rose 0.4% in April
from March and were up 10.1% from a year earlier, according
to Statistics Sweden, the national statistics agency.
   The agency said consumer prices have shot up 6.4% this
year. It said the rise was mainly a result of rent increases
and higher prices on clothes and shoes.

   The 0.4% increase was in line with the 0.5% average
prediction of analysts.
   Sweden's annualized rate of inflation fell to 10.1% in
April from 11.2% in March but was up from 6.5% in April last
year.
   The national Price and Competition office predicted
consumer prices would increase at a rate of 8.6% this year.
Sweden's consumer price index was measured at 205.2 in April,
down from 205.4 in March. The index reflects a 1980 base of
100.
