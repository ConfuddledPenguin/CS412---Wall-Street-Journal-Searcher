   WASHINGTON -- Kathryn McGrath, director of investment
management at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
resigned effective early June to enter private practice.
   Ms. McGrath, a 16-year SEC veteran who has headed the
division for nearly seven years, will become a partner in the
Washington office of the law firm Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.

   The investment-management division regulates the
mutual-fund industry, which has grown furiously in the past
decade to $1 trillion, as well as other investment companies
and utility holding companies. Under Ms. McGrath, 45 years
old, the division has pushed for better mutual-fund
disclosure while at the same time trying to scale back the
size of prospectuses sent to investors.
   It is unclear who will succeed Ms. McGrath. Her one-time
most likely successor, Marianne Smythe, recently moved from a
division associate director slot to executive assistant to
the chairman. The mutual-fund industry, which has often
battled Ms. McGrath in the past, is likely to push its own
candidates for the job.
