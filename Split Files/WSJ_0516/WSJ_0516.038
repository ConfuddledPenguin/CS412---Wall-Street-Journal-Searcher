   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Trade union power and
increased expectations created by political developments in
South Africa appear to have prevented a necessary fall in
wage increases to accompany the economic recession, said
Rudolf Gouws, chief economist for Rand Merchant Bank Ltd.
   In an interview he said this would have a negative impact
on corporate profitability, fixed investment and employment.
He said changes in levels of wage increases normally
coincided with the business cycle, dropping appreciably in
recessionary periods and recovering during upturns.

   But latest available figures showed that since the
beginning of the current recession early last year, the rate
of increase of wages had leveled off but not declined,
reflecting a "fairly strong growth in real per capita
remuneration."
   Since unions were the major force behind this trend,
organized workers would be the main beneficiaries, resulting
in a further widening of the wage gap between organized and
unorganized workers.
