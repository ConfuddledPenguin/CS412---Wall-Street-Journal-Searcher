   It looks so easy in the ads: An investment banker taps on
a laptop computer to calculate a deal from an airplane seat;
a salesperson relaxes in a hotel room as the portable
computer calls the office.
   The reality isn't so good. Computing on the road can be a
world of hassles, transforming into a burden something
designed to be a convenience. The list of hurdles is long:
Airport security closely inspects portables; coach-class tray
tables are too flimsy to hold a big laptop; batteries may die
during an emergency rewrite of a speech; hotel rooms hide the
phone outlet behind the bed, or charge outrageous rates to
get on line.

   The first time Ted Leonsis, president of Redgate
Communications Inc., a Vero Beach, Fla., company, got to the
airport with his hefty Macintosh portable, he came to a
realization. He would have to lug the thing through the rain,
and also check his garment bag because the airline allowed
only two carry-ons. "I said, `This is too hard.' I left it in
the car." Now, his portable moves only between office and
home.
   In fact, most portable-computer owners don't use them much
while they're travelling. Market Facts, a Chicago research
firm, conducted a survey for portable maker Zenith Data
Systems and found 70% of laptop use was at home or in the
office, 8% was in a car or plane, 8% was in a hotel and 7%
was in a customer's office, with the remainder in other
places such as warehouses.
   That not withstanding, portable computers are the fastest
growing segment of the PC market. Bruce Stephen of
International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market
research firm, predicts that 1.1 million portables, valued at
$2.8 billion, will be sold in the U.S. this year, up 26% from
902,000 last year. "It's grown from a niche to a canyon," he
says.
   And by any measure, the portables are steadily improving.
Some battery-powered models based on Intel Corp.'s fast 386
SX microprocessor, weigh less than 17 pounds and have good
enough displays to "be your only PC," PC Magazine concluded
in a March review of 73 different models. Other models called
notebook PCs weigh less than seven pounds and can fit inside
an attache case.
   When the conditions are right, portables clearly make
things easier. Robert V. Costello, a Boston lawyer, says he
can store up to 20,000 pages of documents on his Dell
Computer Inc. laptop, take it into court and instantly check
on what witnesses said in depositions. Likewise, big
corporations create simplified software packages to enable an
entire sales force to obtain specific information while on
the road.
   But for professionals, consultants and entrepreneurs
traveling all over and relying on their laptops to do more --
such as help them receive and answer all their office
correspondence, check on external data, produce slides or
other graphics and turn out contracts -- computing on the go
is a mixture of blessing and curse.
   Take Robert Frankston, the co-developer of Visicalc, one
of the first popular software packages. Last year, Mr.
Frankston was at a computer conference at a posh Seattle
hotel. He set his portable to automatically check his
electronic mail boxes, usually using toll-free 800 numbers.
When he checked out he got a $100 phone bill. The hotel
switchboard had automatically added a 75-cent surcharge every
time it dialed. "Rip-off is the term that comes to mind," Mr.
Frankston gripes.
   For many users, the laptop hassles start as soon as they
get to the airport. Since the downing of the Pan Am jet over
Scotland by a bomb in a radio, security personnel have
examined more closely all electronic equipment. Frequently
they make laptop luggers start up their computers to prove
they are legitimate.
   Computing on board an airplane daunts most users. In
coach, a computer screen that flips up on the back of the
computer gets crushed when the person in front reclines.
Setting up many computers is complex enough to discourage
casual use.
   Lotus Development Corp. Chairman Jim P. Manzi keeps track
of ideas using Agenda, a Lotus software program. But he says
he reverts to pen and paper on planes. The process of
extracting the computer from under the seat, setting it up on
the tray table, booting up the program and then reversing the
process isn't worth it, he says. Other users worry that
seatmates can read their screens.
   Battery life is a problem with many computers that require
recharging after as little as two hours. Dedicated users
carry five pounds or more of spare battery packs and
rechargers. "You're setting yourself up for heartache when
the little beeps tell you it won't do any more," says David
Gang, director of sales and marketing for Snap Software Inc.,
a maker of sales and marketing software in Manchester, N.H.
   To address those problems, some laptops automatically turn
off power to certain parts when the computers aren't in use,
extending battery life. Reducing size solves other problems
too. Compaq Computer Corp.'s LTE/286, introduced last fall,
gives users the option of buying a powerful computer with
both hard and floppy disk drives that can fit inside an
attache case rather than requiring a case of its own.
Reducing size and weight also makes it easier to use them on
planes without breaking the tray tables.
   But then there are the hotels, and all their anguish. Many
hotels don't use modular telephone jacks or special dataports
that provide easy access to telecommunications. Thus many
portable-computer guests don't even try to reach others
electronically. Rod Canion, president of portable pioneer
Compaq Computer, carries a computer for memo-writing, but
won't communicate. "I've found the office runs fine without
me," he says.
   Fans agree that laptops aren't for the faint of heart.
"The laptop is for people who really want to make it work for
them," says Mr. Gang of Snap Software. If electrical outlets,
lighting and flat surfaces are scarce in hotel rooms, "I
don't let the hotel room get in my way," he says. "I move the
furniture around."
   Some dedicated laptop users carry little tool kits to
disassemble telephone outlets and connect the line to their
computers.
   Computer Products Plus Inc., Huntington Beach, Calif.,
makes a $50 kit called Road Warrior that includes
screwdrivers, a lighted magnifier for examining phone outlets
in dark corners and alligator clips for connecting wires to
the computer.
   "E-mail is so endemic to the way we run our business that
I can't exist without it," says Bill Machrone, editor in
chief of PC Magazine, adding that to use his laptop in some
hotels he has to move the bed and remove the phone plate from
the wall. "I always fill out the comment cards and say `I
hate your telephone system and I hate you too.'"
   Hotels aren't oblivious to the problem. New hotels are
being built with modular jacks, and some older ones are
trying to convert them. "In this day and age, if you don't
have extra phone jacks for computers, you won't make a lot of
friends," says Sharon Perper, sales manager for the Embassy
Suites Hotel in South San Francisco. The hotel gets high
marks from some computer users because it doesn't add a
surcharge for calling 800 numbers.
   Andrew Seybold, publisher of a Santa Clara, Calif.,
industry newsletter, is working to compile a computerized
listing of computer friendly hotels. For desperate times,
"I've fashioned an adapter so I can access through my
cellular phone," despite the high rates.
   Worse things can happen. Eugene Lee, product manager for
Beyond Inc., Cambridge, Mass., once carried a computerized
marketing proposal to a potential client in London. Using an
adapter, he plugged the computer into an outlet in his hotel
room for recharging and went to dinner, unaware that the
juice was too strong. When he returned, "the whole screen had
melted. It looked like it had been slimed." Mr. Lee canceled
his presentation and flew back to the U.S. "Sometimes you
just punt," he shrugs.
   Not all problems with on-the-go computers are so dire, but
that doesn't mean they aren't embarrassing. Mark Eppley,
president of Traveling Software Inc., Bothell, Wash., a maker
of equipment for portable computers, says his worst time with
a laptop occurred during a business trip to Korea, when he
spilled kimchi, a pungent condiment, on his keyboard, which
can't be washed. All the way back across the Pacific, he
says, the smell of garlic and cabbage filled the cabin. "Boy
did that make an impression," he says.
