   Portland, Ore. -- Nobody here blinks an eye anymore at
finding sculpture in stairwells or gargoyles on garages.
Administrators of both the Oregon and Portland One Percent
for Art programs say the populace is getting used to having
art encounters of the public kind.
   The state program, one of the first in the country, has
been in existence since 1975, allowing 1% of the construction
budget for state buildings to be allocated for art. In 1980
the city of Portland followed suit, but this year it amended
its program to devote an extra 0.33% to administrative and
maintenance costs.

   There's more. In a move to bring art further into people's
lives, the city council voted to budget art for all city
improvement projects, not just new buildings. Now we have
parking garage art, soon to be followed by sewer art.
   Our newest downtown parking garage is now decorated on an
exterior wall with 10 cheerful terra cotta faces that smile
down on passing pedestrians. The sidewalk, as part of the
construction project, also was eligible for art, so it
contains a work entitled "Streetwise," which makes walking
down the street a meaningful experience.
   The brick sidewalk is peppered with 81 granite blocks of
various sizes. On the blocks are engraved pithy quotes from
Bob Dylan, Yogi Berra, Albert Einstein and other thinkers.
Also thrown in are expressions such as "Don't take it for
granite," "Look up]" and "Step on a crack, break your
mother's back."
   At the garage's dedication, a city commissioner said, "In
Portland we now have a garage with more than just parking,
one with a sense of vibrancy and community spirit."
   That community spirit, in or out of parking garages,
wasn't always there. It has been an uphill battle for the One
Percent administrators, who somehow must convince taxpayers
that this use of their dollars will, in the end, make them
more civilized.
   Nancy Lindburg, manager of the state program, said her
darkest hour was when a state senator learned that the next
project was to be at the Eastern Oregon Correctional
Institution. In a twist on an old political theme, the
senator complained loudly and frequently that the state would
be paying for "a painting in every cell."
   As it turned out, the money went for a life-sized,
inmate-designed concrete sculpture of an inmate. It now
greets visitors at the prison entrance. In the palm of his
hand he is holding a dove -- or pigeon, depending on your
point of view.
   Eloise MacMurray, who manages Portland's public art
program, had a similar experience when a new jail on the
outskirts of town was eligible for an art project. The county
sheriff refused to allow it.
   "We told him it was THE LAW," said Ms. MacMurray.
   The sheriff gave in and appointed staff members to a panel
to decide on the art project most appropriate for the jail.
Final decision: a short, animated film on the experience of
being in jail. Although not exactly a "Bugs Bunny Gets
Busted" sort of thing, it will be shown to children, maybe to
convince them that crime doesn't pay, but art does.
   In Salem, Ms. Lindburg oversees the state program. She is
very proud of the growing collection of art and the
collection's growing value. Works purchased over the past 15
years for $1.4 million are now worth about $6 million.
   "I can't think of anything we've purchased in state
government that has jumped in value like this," she said.
   The point of the program is to place art in the most
public places, where it will be seen and enjoyed by the most
people. Works are selected to reflect the mission of the
particular state agency or institution and to be pleasing to
the eye of the beholder.
   For example, she said, art for the state revenue building,
where people go to pay their taxes, was selected partly for
qualities that induced calm and quietude.
   "They didn't want the work to contribute to anger, Ms.
Lindburg noted.
   Employees, meanwhile, are treated to six-story wire
sculptures in the two stairwells. Sculptor Peter Teneau, who
strung the 22-foot-wide, four-foot-deep sculpture himself
through a hole in the roof, planned that the wired array of
metal rods and discs would rely on the motion of the viewer
to achieve its full effect.
   "It's to encourage people to use the stairs," said Ms.
Lindburg.
   Back in Portland, plans are in the works for a sculpture
to grace the Columbia Waste Water Treatment Plant. The plant
management duly nominated three sewage workers to serve on
the panel that will select and supervise the art work.
   Ms. MacMurray said the exact design hasn't yet been
determined, "but it will be something about how dirty water
is made clean."
   She noted that the plant treats 95% of Portland's sewage
each day and, therefore, has many employees. There are, in
fact, 150 employees who will benefit from the presence of art
at the sewage treatment plant. "That," she said, "is nothing
to sneeze at."
