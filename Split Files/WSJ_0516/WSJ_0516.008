   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp.
unveiled, as expected, a major expansion of CallPath, a
software product that links telephone switches to computers.
   IBM said a new CallPath product will allow its
minicomputers to talk to switches made by four leading
telecommunications companies -- American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., Northern Telecom Inc., Rolm Co. and Siemens
AG. Previously, CallPath had worked only with switches made
by Rolm, which IBM owns in partnership with Siemens.

   Northern Telecom, Rolm and Siemens announced that their
links to CallPath would be available immediately. AT&amp;T said
it will work with IBM to enable its switches to talk to
CallPath, though neither company announced a schedule.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., also announced new CallPath
capabilities and a set of protocols for companies that write
software that works with the product. And it promised that
CallPath will soon work with other switches and IBM
mainframes and personal computers, too.
   Taken together, the announcements suggest that CallPath
will emerge as a standard in the burgeoning field of
"voice-integrated applications."
   "This indicates an eagerness {on IBM's part} to connect to
the broad range of communications vendors' switches," said
Carl Pitasi of the Gartner Group, market researchers based in
Stamford, Conn. "The old CallPath product is a teeny shadow
of what this will become."
   CallPath identifies the origin or destination of calls
made through a telephone switch known as a PBX, for private
branch exchange. Then it automatically pulls information
about callers from an IBM computer. Telephone operators --
customer service representatives or brokers, for example --
can see callers' files displayed on a screen as soon as they
pick up the phone, which saves time and opens up new
marketing opportunities.
