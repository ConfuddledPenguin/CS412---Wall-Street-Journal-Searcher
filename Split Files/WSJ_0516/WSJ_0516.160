   Flexible Bond Trust Inc. said its board plans to take
steps to convert the New York-based closed-end fund to an
open-end investment company.
   The proposed conversion and related matters are expected
to be submitted to shareholders for a vote at a special
meeting scheduled for Sept. 6. If approved, the conversion
would become effective in the 1991 first quarter. The fund
now pays monthly income dividends; it expects to continue
this policy after the conversion. As of March 31, the fund's
assets were valued at $66 million.

   Open-end mutual funds issue and redeem shares on demand
and these trade at a price based on their asset value.
Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade
publicly at a premium to or a discount from their asset
value. Since it went public, Flexible Bond Trust has been
traded at varying discounts; the conversion would eliminate
these discounts.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Flexible Bond Trust shares closed at $7.375.
