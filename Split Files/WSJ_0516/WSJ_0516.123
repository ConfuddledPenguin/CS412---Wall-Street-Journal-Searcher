   WASHINGTON -- The Air Force disclosed that the
radar-eluding fighter it's planning for the 21st century has
a price tag of more than $63 billion.
   The new cost estimate, based on 750 planes, is at least $5
billion higher than the public estimates previously used by
top Pentagon officials.

   The plane, called the Advanced Tactical Fighter, is
designed to be the first U.S. dog fighter to carry missiles
entirely inside its fuselage, the Air Force said. Officials
also confirmed speculation that the plane will have powerful
twin engines intended to push it to supersonic speeds without
using afterburners, making it more difficult to hit with
heat-seeking missiles.
   The Pentagon apparently hopes that releasing sketches of
the sleek fighters and making more information public about
their capabilities will help deflect congressional criticism
of the program. The Pentagon said it already has spent about
$2.8 billion to develop a pair of ATF prototypes. Two teams
of contractors competing to build the plane have invested
another $1.2 billion.
   One of the teams, led by Lockheed Corp., includes Boeing
Co. and General Dynamics Corp. The other team consists of
Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   But many lawmakers increasingly question the huge price
tag and, just last month, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
proposed to delay development of the aircraft for two years
and to reduce production rates once the assembly line gets
going.
