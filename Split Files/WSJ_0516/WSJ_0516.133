   Banque Nationale de Paris announced yesterday that it will
take control of troubled Banque Arabe et Internationale
D'Investissement, which was hobbled by the steep decline in
world crude oil prices during the latter half of the 1980s
and bad loans in developing countries.
   BAII, based in Paris, was created in 1973 with 50% of its
shares held by Arab banks and 50% held by non-Arab financial
institutions. It was one of several banks founded during the
1970s to act as a conduit for the recycling of petrodollars
amassed by the Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.

   BNP will buy all shares outstanding of the bank it doesn't
already own at a price to be set later. The French
state-owned bank will then inject 600 million francs ($108.4
million) of fresh funds into BAII.
   Following the capital boost, BAII's capital structure will
be modified once again, such that BNP will cede a portion of
the bank's shares to other unnamed future shareholders while
retaining a majority stake for itself.
   The operations of BAII will be reorganized, BNP said, but
the focus of its business will remain within the countries of
the Maghreb and the Middle East.
