   STOCKHOLM -- Continuing an international buying spree,
Nobel Industries Sweden AB agreed to acquire Spectra-Physics
Inc. of San Jose, Calif., a major producer of lasers and
laser systems.
   Nobel said its Pharos AB unit won an international auction
for Spectra-Physics by agreeing to pay an estimated $325
million, roughly equal to the U.S. company's 1989 sales. The
transaction is subject to U.S. government approval, Nobel
said.

   The seller is Swiss chemicals and drug giant Ciba-Geigy
AG, which bought the U.S. laser concern three years ago. More
recently, Ciba-Geigy changed direction and opted to sell
Spectra-Physics and other health-care related electronics
units. But Ciba-Geigy officials said it would continue
cooperation with Spectra-Physics in development of certain
instruments and laser applications.
   The Spectra-Physics purchase is the third international
acquisition proposed by Nobel this month. If, as expected, a
pending British takeover bid succeeds and other required
government clearances are obtained, Nobel's trio of new units
would boost its annual sales by almost 20% to 26 billion
Swedish kronor ($4.32 billion).
   The month began with Nobel's #205 million ($345 million)
purchase of Crown Berger Ltd., Britain's second-biggest
producer of paint. That move reflected the Swedish concern's
drive to expand consumer-related paint operations and
strengthen its position in the United Kingdom, one of its
weakest markets.
   Pharos, Nobel's fast-growing collection of high-technology
businesses, accounted for both remaining acquisitions. First,
Pharos launched a #16 million bid for Continental Microwave
PLC, a British manufacturer of satellite TV broadcasting and
receiving equipment. The offer is pending but Pharos already
owns 29.8% of the target company's shares and has received
irrevocable commitments by holders of an additional 26.7%
stake. Swallowing Continental Microwave and Spectra-Physics
would nearly triple Pharos's annual sales to about four
billion kronor. The unit, which is separately quoted on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange, plans to finance the acquisitions
with an estimated one billion-kronor share offering later
this year. Nobel has agreed to guarantee the new issue and
plans to maintain its current 75% voting stake in Pharos.
   Anders Carlberg, Nobel chief executive officer, said all
of Spectra-Physics' business areas would be maintained
intact. The company holds world-leading positions in several
applications of laser technology, such as bar code scanners
in point-of-sales systems and instruments used in medical
research and control of construction and agricultural
machines.
   Last year, Spectra-Physics reported pretax profit of $15
million on sales of $325 million. Sales growth has averaged
23% the past three years and is expected to remain robust.
Still, Mr. Carlberg predicted that Nobel could increase
profitability by trimming overhead remaining from
Spectra-Physics' days as an independent company.
   Nobel has shown a flair for managing small high-tech niche
companies since wresting majority control of Pharos in 1986.
In a swift turnaround, the unit posted pretax profit of 150
million kronor last year, compared with a loss of 75 million
kronor three years earlier.
   But industry analysts warned that Nobel will have to spend
heavily to maintain Spectra-Physics' heady growth. A hefty
research budget was one major reason Ciba-Geigy decided to
shed the U.S. concern, these analysts said.
   The acquisition also looms as the biggest test so far of
Nobel's management prowess in the U.S. But as one of the few
Swedish companies headed by a foreigner, Pharos already had a
North American management flavor. The prime architect of
Pharos's turnaround has been Lawrence Karlson, a Canadian
executive previously with Nobel's AB Bofors unit.
