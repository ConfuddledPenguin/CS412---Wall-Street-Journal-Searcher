   You don't have to be a class warrior to wonder why with
courts bursting at the seams with drug and violent crime
cases, New York courts spent the past two years agonizing
over which yacht to declare the rightful holder of the
America's Cup. Probably all the lawyers and judges involved
in this litigation wish it had been settled amicably out of
court. Still, no one dared utter the thought that maybe there
are some disputes that don't belong in court, that judges can
sometimes just say no, go away, we're too busy, shoo.
   This is too bad, because in musty law books is an old case
that could have saved everyone a lot of trouble and the
taxpayers a lot of expense. But before getting to the marvels
of trust law, consider the fascinating facts behind Mercury
Bay Boating Club v. San Diego Yacht Club. The Americas Cup
match was created under a trust created by yacht-owner George
Schuyler in 1887. His deed refers to "a perpetual challenge
Cup for the friendly competition between foreign countries."

   Competition in recent years hasn't been real friendly, but
has shown that foreigners have learned to jib neatly through
the U.S. court system. New Zealand investment banker Michael
Fay read the America's Cup deed to say that the challenger
can choose the timing and nature of a match. In 1987, he
called for a one-on-one duel with the San Diego club where
New Zealand would use a 90-foot yacht similar to a kind --
called J boats -- that hadn't been built in a half-century.
   Trouble was that San Diego was already planning a big
competition for 1991 with more typical 12-meter boats -- a
competition the city hoped would bring in $1.2 billion in
revenues. So the San Diego club ignored Mr. Fay's challenge.
Mr. Fay decided to go to court. New York Judge Carmen
Ciparick ruled in 1987 that his challenge was good under the
deed. Then the San Diego club decided to make sure the Kiwis
couldn't win against skipper Dennis Conner, who had won the
America's Cup for the U.S.
   Instead of racing in a 90-foot or even a 12-meter boat,
San Diego sailed in 1988 in a 60-foot catamaran, the Stars
and Stripes. This double hull against the New Zealand single
hull was a Ferrari against a Hyundai. San Diego won easily
and went back to preparing for its 12-meter competition among
several vessels.
   Mr. Fay wasn't done. He returned to court to say that San
Diego had violated the America's Cup deed by fighting dirty.
Judge Ciparick agreed. Although the deed only stipulated
certain dimensions for sailboats ("length on load water-line;
beam at load water-line and extreme beam; and draught of
water"), which the catamaran fit, Judge Ciparick decided to
go beyond the written words of the deed. She ruled that Mr.
Schuyler intended that vessels be at least "somewhat evenly
matched." San Diego would have to forfeit the cup.
   Strict constructionism still lives in New York courts,
however. Judge Ciparick was overruled by an appeals court,
which said that even a lopsided race fit the precise wording
of the America's Cup deed. By the time the
multimillion-dollar litigation reached the state's highest
court, two heavyweights of the New York bar were drafted into
action. Landlubber Harold Tyler argued for San Diego. Amateur
yachtsman Robert Fiske Jr. made the case for New Zealand. The
argument was lively, with Mr. Fiske at one point standing
with his legs far apart to illustrate the huge stability
advantage of a catamaran against his client's single hull.
   But the New York court last month decided by a 5-2 vote
that fair or unfair, the race stands. There was the unusual
feature that the defending yacht club also served as trustee
and so had a high duty to the challenger. Still, the court
ruled that San Diego had met the requirements under the deed.
The majority opinion noted that "sportsmanship and fairness .
. . are not questions suitable for judicial resolution."
   New York's chief judge, Sol Wachtler, wrote a concurring
opinion warning against "the most distasteful innovation of
all in this case -- resolution of the competition in court."
He said that if New Zealand had won the case, from now on "no
defender could be secure in victory without a court order
attesting to the fact that it had not won too easily." He
zinged winner and loser: "If the traditions and ideals of the
sport are dependent on judicial coercion, that battle is
already lost."
   There may have been an even better way to send the message
that this competition belongs in the water, not in a crowded
judicial docket. There was a line in a footnote in the
majority opinion that had a touch of wistfulness. Citing an
English case from 1895 that "trusts created for the purpose
of promoting sports events are not true charitable trusts,"
the court noted that nobody in this litigation had argued
that the America's Cup trust was void.
   This is too bad. The reasoning of this case decided by the
Chancery Court would have ended this litigation before it
began. English courts have traditionally refused the burden
of resolving disputes about trusts except in the clearly
worthy area of charities.
   The century-old case, Re Nottage, also dealt with a trust
to create a yacht race, this one awarding a planned Nottage
Cup to the victor. But the English courts invalidated the
trust, with one judge explaining that "there are many things
which are laudable and useful to society which yet cannot be
considered charitable, and this, in my opinion, is one of
them."
   It wasn't just the oddity of a rich man's yacht race as a
charity that led the English courts to refuse to enforce the
Nottage Cup. There was also this serious question of public
policy and the proper role of judges. As an English court
noted back in 1804, what's called a non-charitable-purpose
trust requires that "there must be somebody in whose favor
the court can decree performance." Otherwise, there is the
big risk that the trust will become a massive administrative
headache for judges with more pressing duties.
   One reason U.S. courts are asked to decide questions such
as what's fair in yachting is that unlike courts elsewhere,
ours have taken a wide view of the kinds of trusts they will
take the time and effort to enforce. This approach expanded
the jurisdiction of U.S. courts without anyone giving much
thought to whether it's such a good idea that judges invite
all such challenges.
   In other words, that the America's Cup litigation made it
into court at all is the result of American judicial
activism. New York judges eventually decided not to become
yacht adjudicators, but could have done so years ago by
simply saying that if yachtsmen can't work out matters on
their own, too bad, case dismissed.
   Meanwhile, the yachting world seems to have cleaned up its
legal act. In order to avoid litigation in future cases,
representatives of several yacht clubs have signed a detailed
agreement that future disputes about the America's Cup will
be resolved through mediation. Taking no chances, each
commodore and witness initialed at the bottom of each page.
