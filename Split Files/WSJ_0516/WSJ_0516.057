   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Office Products of America Inc. said
it expects to report a net operating loss for 1990, its first
full year of operation, despite substantial operating revenue
generated from its three stores.
   The office-products warehouse concern said the loss will
result from start-up and administrative expenses associated
with its already-opened stores and stores it intends to open
this year. In the first quarter, Office Products reported a
net loss of $798,079, or nine cents a share, on revenue of
about $1 million. The company went public in August 1989.
