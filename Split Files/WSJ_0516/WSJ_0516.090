   NEW YORK -- Company chairmen who bet big on their
companies' stocks in the first four months of this year
generally saw their faith rewarded.
   While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 2.5%
this year, some of the chairmen have scored much bigger
gains, according to data compiled by Invest/Net, a North
Miami, Fla., firm that tracks Securities and Exchange
Commission filings by officers, directors and other corporate
insiders.

   Overall, according to Invest/Net, 10 of the 12 chairmen
who increased their stakes by more than 1% have profited, at
least on paper.
   Consider Thomas Owens, who heads XL/Datacomp Inc. of
Hinsdale, Ill. Mr. Owens spent about $306,000 on 42,000
shares of the computer remarketer in purchases in February
and March, SEC filings show. He paid an average price of
$7.28 a share. The stock closed yesterday in national
over-the-counter trading at $9.75, unchanged.
   "There had been a lot of panic selling in the stock" last
year on news that International Business Machines Corp. would
reduce its discount to computer remarketers, squeezing their
profit margins, said Mr. Owens. "The marketplace reacted
horribly," substantially overselling the shares.
   Mr. Owens said he bought both to support the stock and
because he thought he was getting a bargain price. "I've made
a nice profit," he said, adding that he expects an even more
significant profit given the stock's trading range last fall
of about $20-$24.
   For Jack Byrne, chairman of Fund American Cos. and its
Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos. unit, love turned into a smart
investment strategy. Last February, he spent about $1.9
million on 60,000 shares of the Greenwich, Conn., parent
company.
   "I bought them to be a Valentine's Day present for my
wife," said Mr. Byrne. "That's all the economic thinking that
went into it." Still, Mr. Byrne added, "the stock looked
awfully cheap to me."
   He paid an average share price of $31.13. Yesterday, the
stock closed in New York Stock Exchange trading at $32.375,
down 37.5 cents.
   But Mr. Byrne isn't bragging about his market-timing
ability. "The stock went off two to three points immediately
after I bought," he recalls with a laugh. "That shows my
perspicacity."
   Moreover, he says his wife initially needled him about his
timing, and he quips that next year he may give her roses
instead. He adds that the purchase represented only a small
portion of his total holdings; Fund American's latest proxy
statement shows that Mr. Byrne owns a total of 2,630,000
shares, either outright or through warrants or options.
   Sometimes, such big-money bets aren't as well timed. For
example, in October 1988, John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman
and chief executive officer, spent $2.5 million to buy
100,000 Citicorp shares, mostly at $25 a share. The stock
closed yesterday at $24, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Mr. Reed is "delighted with his holdings," he said through
a spokesman yesterday. The Citicorp chief is "a long-term
investor" and continues to believe Citicorp stock is "a great
investment," the spokesman said. He also pointed out that Mr.
Reed's 1988 purchase represented only part of his stake,
which he said now totals 543,306 shares -- making him the
company's largest individual holder.
   On the other hand, SEC filings show that William Schreyer,
chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., in February of this year
purchased 20,000 shares at $22.18 a share. The purchase came
shortly after the company announced a cost-cutting program
that depressed quarterly earnings and, subsequently, the
price of Merrill stock. At the time, Mr. Schreyer said the
price decline made the stock a particularly good value.
Yesterday, on the New York Stock Exchange, it closed at
$23.25, down 37.5 cents.
   Carl S. Quinn, chairman of Arkla Exploration Co., doubled
his holdings in the Shreveport, La., oil and gas exploration
company with an April 12 purchase of 11,000 shares, SEC
filings show.
   It's paid off handsomely. While Mr. Quinn paid $16.53 a
share, according to the filings, the stock closed yesterday
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at
$19.875, up 12.5 cents.
   Arkla Exploration, a unit of Arkla Inc., just went public
last December. Its stock price has ranged between about $16
and $23 since, said corporate secretary Greg Jones. Mr.
Quinn, he said, bought near its low, when the stock "had
mirrored the decline in oil and gas stocks." Oil and gas
demand was soft in the first two months of the year, which
were warmer than expected, and that depressed stocks
throughout the sector. But the sector in general is beginning
to rebound, he said, Arkla shares along with it.
   Mr. Quinn was out of the country and not available for
comment.
