   ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A U.S. district court judge here,
citing legal complexities, agreed to postpone Exxon Corp.'s
trial on criminal felony and misdemeanor charges related to
the March 24, 1989, Alaska oil spill.
   The oil giant had been scheduled to go on trial June 8 in
Anchorage. In his ruling, Judge H. Russel Holland sided with
Exxon attorneys, who had asked for the delay on the grounds
that the charges against Exxon posed certain "novel legal
issues" and involved collection of "an extraordinary volume
of data."

   The judge didn't set a new trial date but ordered both
Exxon and Justice Department attorneys to agree on a calendar
for the filing of pretrial motions. A Justice Department
spokesman declined to comment on the ruling but confirmed
that Justice hadn't objected to Exxon's motion for more time.
Exxon also declined to comment.
   There is speculation that the Justice Department might try
to strike an out-of-court settlement with Exxon, something
that a delay could affect. However, a government spokeswoman
said the Justice Department isn't engaged in plea
negotiations with Exxon.
   The two sides had reached a tentative plea bargain that
would have allowed Exxon to escape more serious criminal
charges in exchange for paying $550 million into a
restoration fund. But the deal fell apart after Alaska
officials and environmental groups objected to provisions
that would have given Exxon a large say in restoration-fund
spending, and would have effectively kept the government from
participating in massive civil litigation against Exxon.
   Exxon was charged with five federal counts, including two
felonies related to the competence of ship crew members. It
also was charged with misdemeanor violations of pollution
laws, and laws against killing of migratory birds.
