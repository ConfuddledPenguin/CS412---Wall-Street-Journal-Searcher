   PASADENA, Calif. -- Leonard J. Pieroni became chief
executive officer and was elected chairman of Parsons Corp.,
succeeding William E. Leonhard, who retired after 15 years at
the helm.
   Mr. Pieroni, 51 years old, was elected chairman at a board
meeting, when he also assumed the chief executive title. He
had been named to that post in April.

   Mr. Pieroni has held various positions at Parsons since
joining one of its subsidiaries more than 17 years ago. Last
year, he was named executive vice president in charge of
corporate planning. Those duties will be divided among other
executives, Parsons said.
   Mr. Leonhard, 75, joined Parsons in 1966, was named chief
executive in 1975 and chairman in 1978. The engineering and
construction company was acquired by its employees in 1985.
