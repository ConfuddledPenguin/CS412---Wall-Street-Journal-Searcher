   CHICAGO -- Quixote Corp.'s sale of its compact-disk unit
to an Australian concern has boomeranged, and Quixote says it
couldn't be happier.
   The holding company yesterday announced that it had
reacquired -- for $1,000 -- the remaining 51% of an operation
it sold for $55.5 million two years ago. What's more, the CD
unit, which was losing money when Quixote sold it, is now
profitable, says a spokeswoman. The unit makes laser video
disks, audio compact disks and CDs for use in computers.

   Quixote sold the unit, then called LaserVideo Inc., to
Disctronics Ltd. of Melbourne in January 1988. The Australian
company paid Quixote $29 million cash and issued a note for
$26.5 million, payable in January 1989.
   Disctronics didn't make good on the note. Quixote
initially sued, but late last year it entered into a new
agreement under which Quixote received 49% stake in its
former unit, now called Disctronics Manufacturing Inc.
   As part of the revised agreement, Disctronics Ltd. also
issued Quixote preferred shares and set up a schedule of
repayments which, if Disctronics didn't meet, allowed Quixote
to buy the remainder of the unit for a "nominal" $1,000.
   Disctronics Ltd. didn't meet the first payment, scheduled
for April 30, Quixote says, and so the Chicago company
"regained total ownership."
   The unit, renamed yet again Disc Manufacturing Inc., seems
none the worse for its round trip: Quixote said Disc's sales
climbed 70% in the year ended March 31, to $38 million, and
are expected to climb to $55 million in the current 12
months. Operating profit was $3.8 million in the latest year,
and is also expected to increase "at a good clip," Quixote
said, thanks in part to $10 million its former owners spent
to boost capacity.
   Disc, which manufactures CDs at plants in Alabama and
California, is also benefiting from trends favorable to
domestic CD manufacturers, Quixote said.
   Quixote is a holding company with interests in
highway-safety products, computer-aided transcription
services and diagnostic equipment.
