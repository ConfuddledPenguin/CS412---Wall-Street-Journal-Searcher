   LOS ANGELES -- William P. Brown resigned as president of
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. in the wake of the company's
continuing poor financial performance.
   The decision was announced by the company's St.
Louis-based parent, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Spokesmen there
and at the helicopter company in Mesa, Ariz., refused to
speculate on the reason for the resignation, which is
effective Friday. Mr. Brown wasn't available to comment.

   McDonnell Douglas said a successor will be named in a few
weeks. Until then, William S. Ross, president of the St.
Louis-based McDonnell Aircraft Co. unit, will take on the
additional duty of overseeing the helicopter company.
   Mr. Brown, 57 years old, will become a consultant to the
parent company and will work out of an office in the Phoenix,
Ariz., area, said a spokesman for the helicopter unit. The
executive joined the company in 1980 as chief engineer on the
Army's Apache helicopter program before the company was
acquired by McDonnell Douglas.
   Mr. Brown played an important role in smoothing the
company's move in 1986 to Mesa from Culver City, Calif.,
McDonnell Douglas said. During his tenure, he also launched
three helicopter programs and implemented a reorganization
plan.
   Last year, the helicopter company had a $137 million
write-off, mainly related to the Apache program, which
accounted for about 80% of the company's revenue. In
February, the company said it was trimming its work force and
making other spending cuts to improve its financial
performance and lessen the effect of reductions in defense
spending.
