   TOKYO -- Is Japan's Great Bear Market of 1990 already
over?
   Tokyo's disastrous first quarter, when the stock market
plunged 28%, rapidly is giving way to a modest second-quarter
recovery. Major Japanese stock market indexes have recovered
more than a third of earlier losses. Daily trading volume is
rising.

   "The market definitely has a firmer tone," says Robert
Alan Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Tokyo
office. "Confidence is coming back. At least for now, it
looks better."
   But analysts here, still smarting from the Tokyo market's
earlier thrashing, remain cautious. They say the factors
supporting share prices aren't permanent and warn that the
market easily could reverse direction again. "The market is
stuck between renewed optimism and fear of (too rapid) a
recovery," says Bruce D. Johnson, a director of Baring
Securities Ltd.
   From its low of about 28000, the Nikkei average of 225
major stocks is up 14.3% -- having recovered about 4000 of
the 11,000 points it lost in the first quarter. On Tuesday,
the indicator slipped slightly, losing 45.61 points, or
0.14%, to 31997.04. On Monday, spurred by gains on Wall
Street, the Nikkei had gained 530.51 points, or 1.7%.
   The Japanese government bond market, too, is staging a
healthy recovery from the battering it took in January. The
benchmark No. 119 10-year issue rose 0.59 yen to 88.25
yesterday, yielding 6.9%. That's down from a recent yield of
7.4%.
   The turnaround in the Tokyo stock market's fortunes
reflects a reversal in the conditions that triggered its
plunge starting in January. Then, a depreciating yen and
rising interest rates ravaged the Japanese bond market and
sent stocks into a tailspin. Concern about inflation was
rampant. Fears of tighter credit in the U.S. and the prospect
of a unified Germany fed uncertainty about the international
economy. Even Japanese domestic politics were in the throes
of upheaval.
   The most notable change from those times has been the
yen's powerful resurgence. Since dropping to a 39-month low
of 160.30 yen to the dollar in early April, the Japanese
currency has soared nearly 6% against the dollar. The
dollar's march higher was blunted chiefly by a shift in the
outlook for interest rates, which appear to have plateaued in
Japan and the U.S.
   Now, signs that the U.S. economy is slowing have fueled
expectations that the Federal Reserve won't have to increase
U.S. rates. That would make U.S. financial instruments
relatively less attractive to Japanese investors. The same
series of Japanese rate increases that helped unravel
confidence here during January now means that interest rates
in Tokyo already are as high or higher than rates in the
U.S., after subtracting inflation.
   Thus, big Japanese investors are likely to move money from
the U.S. back to Japan, where they can earn similar returns
without exchange-rate risk. Already, some people who watch
capital flows say money is flowing back to Tokyo -- though
they say the surging yen may be due for a minor correction
soon.
   In one sign of the renewed interest in Japanese stocks,
trading volume yesterday was the highest of the year, at
around 900 million shares, up from the previous record of 824
million shares on Monday. Both levels are well above average
daily turnover of only about half a billion shares during the
Japanese stock market's downturn in the first three months of
the year.
   The shift in the tastes of major investors comes at the
same time that Japan's economic fundamentals point to a
stronger stock market. Inflation is coming down -- wholesale
prices in the first 20 days of March were up only 0.7% from
the like period a year earlier.
   And Japan's monumental trade surpluses show signs of a
renewed expansion. In the first quarter of 1990, the surplus
surged to more than $70 billion on an annualized basis, up
from $53 billion in the year ended March 1990. That means
more cash will accumulate in Japan -- and its owners will
have to look for places to stash it.
   Even the political situation in Japan seems to bode better
for the stock market. In January and February, the market was
shaken by doubts about the future of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, which faced a general election in late
February. It won that election, and since then the government
of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has been looking increasingly
stable. This month, Mr. Kaifu even introduced a package of
electoral reform proposals that many market participants
welcome as a sign that the government is confident of its
political strength.
   But despite what analysts here are calling the
"mini-merits" of the current upswing in stocks, the memory of
the market's steep first-quarter drop is enough to keep most
investors circumspect. "The stock market has to take a rest,"
says Mitsuru Ueda, a fund manager for the investment
management arm of Yamaichi Securities Co. "We have to be very
cautious at the moment."
   And from a technical point of view, warns Benedicte Ivey,
a saleswoman at Credit Lyonnais Securities Ltd. in Tokyo, the
market's recovery may prove a precursor to a further retreat.
"In these bear markets, you often see prices move off their
bottoms before resuming their decline," she says.
   Besides, adds a salesman at a Japanese securities house
here, "it's still not a real market anyway." That's because
the market hasn't had to absorb any new stock issues since
March, when big brokerage houses here indefinitely suspended
all new equity underwritings.
   "For the long term," says Mikio Fujino, an international
salesman at Nikko Securities Co., "we are still worrying."
