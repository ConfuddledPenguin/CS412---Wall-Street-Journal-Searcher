   A higher-than-expected number of cancers of the lymph
system was uncovered among maintenance workers in the
nation's flour mills.
   The new finding by researchers at the federal National
Cancer Institute raised suspicions that the chemicals used by
flour mills to fumigate grain and grain bins may be
carcinogenic. The fumigants are used to thwart insect
infestations.

   The new study, published in the current issue of the NCI's
semimonthly Journal, follows up on a preliminary study in
1987 that indicated an unexpectedly high death rate from
cancers of the pancreas, blood and lymph systems among
members of the American Federation of Grain Millers union.
The members include those working in grain storage elevators,
soybean, potato and animal-feed processing plants as well as
in flour mills.
   To pinpoint exactly which union members were at risk the
NCI researchers did a detailed analysis of nearly 23,000
members and former members of the union's life insurance
program. Overall, there were fewer deaths in the previous 30
years among the grain handlers than among American white
males of the same ages, a not-unexpected finding when
particular occupational or geographical groups are compared
with the general population.
   But, the researchers found, there was a concentration of a
cancer known as non-Hodgkins lymphoma among flour-mill
workers. Of the 24 lymphoma deaths among the grain handlers,
21 occurred in flour-mill workers. Moreover, the risk of
dying of the lymphoma increased as length of employment in
the flour mills increased; 12 of the dead men had worked 20
or more years in a flour mill while only two had worked less
than 10 years in the mills.
   A breakdown of the lymphoma deaths by the department found
that workers in the mills' maintenance departments had an
eight-fold higher risk than other flour mill workers of dying
of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, epidemiologist Michael C.R.
Alavanja and his colleagues reported. Workers in the mills'
grain elevators had an almost three-fold higher risk of dying
of the cancer.
   Suspicion of what might be causing the cancer is focused
on the chemical fumigants since a survey found twice as many
flour-mill workers had handled these pesticides as workers in
other segments of the grain industry, the researchers said.
   "Since workers in the maintenance department are
responsible for maintaining and repairing machinery and
equipment in every department of a flour mill, they would
tend to have the most diverse occupational exposures" to the
chemical fumigants, they noted. The elevator workers are most
likely to have applied the fumigants to the stored grain and
thus are most likely to have been directly exposed to the
chemicals.
   Flour mills have switched chemical fumigants several times
over the last 40 years so its uncertain which, if any, of the
chemicals might be responsible. However, since the 1960s
aluminum phosphide pellets, which release phosphine gas on
exposure to moisture in the grain bins, have been widely used
by the mills, the researchers noted. A recent study at the
University of Minnesota found that among workers who applied
pesticides, those that were exposed to phosphine had evidence
of increased genetic damage in their white blood cells during
the pesticide application season. Lymphoma is a cancer of the
white blood cells.
