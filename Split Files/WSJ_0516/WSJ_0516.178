   Circle K Corp., the nation's second-largest convenience
store chain, filed for bankruptcy court protection last night
after failing to get creditors to agree to a restructuring of
its $1.1 billion in high-yield, below-investment-grade "junk"
debt.
   Circle K President Robert A. Dearth Jr. told Circle K
employees that management will continue to run the chain,
based in Phoenix, Ariz., and that it is contacting key
vendors, seeking their cooperation to keep stores stocked.

   The filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
marks the end of a hard-fought battle by William Franke and
other outside directors to win lender approval of a plan to
avoid a bankruptcy-law filing. The efforts were supported by
Circle K's largest shareholder, the Cincinnati investor Carl
Lindner, whose American Financial Corp. holds 38% of the
stock and is a large Circle K creditor. The moves were aimed
at gaining enough time to sell assets, generate cash, and
design a new competitive plan.
   Indeed, the company last month averted a default on its
debt by signing a preliminary accord with senior creditors
and Mr. Lindner that provided a seven-month moratorium on
debt and interest payments. And earlier this month, Circle
K's widely criticized chairman, Karl Eller, resigned.
