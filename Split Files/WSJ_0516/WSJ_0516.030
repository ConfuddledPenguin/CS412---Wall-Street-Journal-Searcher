   Regarding Tim W. Ferguson's April 17 Business World
column, "Where the Greens Risk Soiling Themselves": As
members of the "thirtysomething generation" with two kids in
diapers, we take issue with Mr. Ferguson's implication that
disposable diapers are not a legitimate environmental
concern. Using them creates non-recyclable trash and lots of
it. One can argue whether there are worse offenders, but that
does not solve the problem.
   As Mr. Ferguson notes, disposables are popular, and
rightly so, because they are convenient. No one wants to
spend his or her days washing diapers like mom used to do.
But the diaper services he mocks offer a recyclable
alternative. We discovered to our surprise that for less than
the monthly cost of disposables, we can keep our two kids in
100% reusable cloth diapers that are delivered and picked up
at the door. And one does not need to be "affluent young in
urban centers" as he suggests to take advantage of a diaper
service. We have it here in a little Oregon town. You may,
too. Just look in your phone book.
