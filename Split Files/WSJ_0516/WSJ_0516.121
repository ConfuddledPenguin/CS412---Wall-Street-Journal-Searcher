   Unconsolidated pretax profit at Citizen Watch Co. declined
3.5% in the year ended March 31 to 15.14 billion yen ($99.3
million) from 15.69 billion yen a year earlier because of
weak sales of wristwatches.
   Net income was 7.82 billion yen, up 30% from 6 billion yen
a year earlier.

   Net sales increased 6.9% to 195.25 billion yen from 182.70
billion yen.
   However, net sales of wristwatches, Citizen's main
business, sagged because of slower demand, the company said.
Citizen reported 105.85 billion yen in net sales of
wristwatches and parts, down 2.9% from 109.05 billion yen a
year earlier. Sales of wristwatches made up 54% of the
company's business in the year.
   Sales were stronger in other areas, including industrial
machinery and equipment, and office equipment.
