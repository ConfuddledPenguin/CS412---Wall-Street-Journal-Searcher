   CINCINNATI -- "Kroger Is Gone, Analysts Predict," was the
dire headline in the Cincinnati Post. Hostile bidders, the
Hafts and KKR, had descended on the nation's second largest
grocery chain.
   When the September 1988 story came out, "people were
crying in the hall," says Joseph Pichler, Kroger's president.

   "`Make this go away,' they told me. I said, `I wish I
could.'"
   He did. Faced with much the same threat to its
independence as rival Safeway faced two years earlier, Kroger
chose a very different path. Instead of going private in a
KKR-led LBO, Kroger officials countered by offering
shareholders a hefty dividend and employees a significant
ownership stake in what remains a public company.
   While Kroger had to take on $4.1 billion in debt and it
had to cut costs, it sold far fewer assets than Safeway did
and reduced its work force by about 3%, while Safeway reduced
its by about a third. Yet today Kroger has about the same
operating-profit per employee as Safeway.
   In some ways, Kroger's story undermines two LBO articles
of faith: That a company under attack from raiders has to go
private to ward them off, and that, after an LBO, labor
forces have to be cut severely to support the resulting
interest burden.
   This isn't to suggest, however, that an LBO can't be
structured to share ownership more broadly or to cut costs in
a less severe manner than Safeway, or that recapitalizations
are panaceas. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich plunged into crisis
after its recapitalization when it couldn't sell assets for
enough cash to pay down its huge debt.
   But the recap seems to have worked so far for Kroger. "We
kept asking ourselves the question, if it's so good for an
outside group of investors to come in, leverage up a company,
peel off underperforming assets, pay down debt and walk off
with the equity themselves, why shouldn't it be equally good
for our existing shareholders to benefit from exactly the
same transaction?" Mr. Pichler recalls.
   Safeway says it looked at the same question two years
earlier but chose to do an LBO because it would free the
company from having to please shareholders with short-term
profits and from future takeover threats. Certain tax breaks
since rescinded also made the LBO option more attractive in
1986 than in later years.
   For Kroger, the call to action came when the Hafts offered
$55-a-share for a "business combination." Then KKR made an
unsolicited bid -- despite its reputation as a "white knight"
-- to buy out the company for $58.50 a share. When Kroger
turned a cold shoulder, KKR upped its offer to $64.
   Kroger quickly unfurled its plan: Shareholders would get a
$40 a share cash dividend, plus an $8 junior subordinated
debenture and a remaining interest in the company, called
stub stock. The package was valued by Kroger at $57 to $61 a
share. The recap plan also liberalized stock options so that
all employees, rather than a thin slice at the top, could
increase their ownership: Employees could go from owning 6%
to more than 25% of Kroger's shares; corporate officers'
ownership, on the other hand, could rise only from 1% to 3%.
   The recap lagged by at least 5% to 10% behind KKR's $64
final bid. Even so, the board approved the recap on September
23 and the company remained public. Investors and employees
reacted favorably to the offer. The value of the stub stock
initially more than doubled but has since slipped to $14,
still well above the initial offering price of $9.13. And
Kroger workers took ample advantage of the new stock options.
By 1990, Kroger increased employee ownership even more, to
35%.
   The recap yielded them tens of millions of dollars for
senior managers. Lyle Everingham, the chairman, got an
estimated $10.5 million in cash and another $2.3 million in
debentures. Mr. Pichler got $3.5 million in cash and $763,000
in debentures. And Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., made $25 million for
advising Kroger.
   In the aftermath, Kroger too was faced with a
multi-billion-dollar debt. It laid off 314 people from
headquarters, and with the subsequent asset sales, purged
more than 4,000 employees from the payroll.
   But the Kroger severance package was more generous than
Safeway's. Fired employees received a month's salary for
every year of service to a maximum of nine months, compared
with a maximum of eight weeks salary at Safeway. They also
got medical benefits for one year, while Safeway employees
lost their benefits in as little as two weeks.
   Kroger's generosity shouldn't be overstated, though:
Kroger cut costs by cutting average hourly salaries of $8.12
(or $11.39 with fringe benefits) in 1985 to $7.07 (or $9.84
with benefits) in 1989. Kroger, like Safeway, saved money by
paying its specialty department workers a lower rate. And
Kroger has also negotiated two-tier pay scales and raised
eligibility requirements for medical benefits.
   In selling assets, Kroger sold less-prized properties and
a total of 100 stores, only 10% of its operations. Safeway,
on the other hand, sold 1,100 of its 2,325 stores. Kroger
also turned to employees who generated thousands of
cost-saving steps.
   Like Safeway, Kroger has adopted an incentive bonus plan,
but it appears to be more democratic than its Oakland
rival's. Kroger's new bonus system extends to secretaries and
the plan adjusts for factors beyond employees' control-such
as working in a store in a high-crime neighborhood.
   "We're fairly excited about Kroger's bonus plan," says Ed
Hardy, a national negotiator for the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union. "It's more of a gain-sharing plan
than a bonus based on profits."
   While Kroger has improved its profit-sharing plan, Safeway
stopped contributing to its plan in 1987. At the same time,
Safeway also tried unsuccessfully to raid surplus funds in
its employee retirement account, which provides retirees with
an average pension of less than $400 a month. Retirees
retained counsel to halt the raid, and Robert Van Gemert,
retired Safeway general counsel, did some research and
discovered that the original Safeway pension charter in fact
grants the surplus to the retirees.
   So far, Kroger seems to be faring competitively at least
as well as Safeway. In fiscal year 1989, its first year after
restructuring, Kroger's cash flow rose 22% -- better than the
16% gain the company originally forecast at the time it
restructured. Kroger, like Safeway, hasn't raised prices-and
in some markets has lowered them. And Kroger, like Safeway,
managed to refinance its bank-credit agreement and lower
interest expenses.
   But Kroger also now supports 60,000 more workers than
Safeway, while maintaining a similar operating profit as a
percentage of sales.
   Kroger also has increased its charitable cash
contributions since the recap to $3.6 million last year from
$2.1 million in 1987, while Safeway trimmed its corporate
cash giving to $2.7 million last year from $3.2 million in
1986.
   Thanks to the massive debt, Kroger operated at a net loss
of $72.7 million in 1989; Safeway's net loss was $488 million
its first year after the buy-out. (The two chains are fairly
comparable in number of stores and in sales.) By the first
quarter of 1990, Kroger's net loss had shrunk to $10 million,
a 46% improvement from the same period a year earlier. And
analysts are estimating earnings for next year.
   "Kroger is an extremely strong company today, with very
strong cash flow and very strong markets," says Debra Levin,
a retail analyst who follows Kroger for Salomon Brothers. "If
they had been taken over (in an LBO), they might not look all
that different from the way they look today, but I don't know
that they would have gotten that same motivation level from
their employees."

   KROGER Co. doesn't have as high an operating profit per
