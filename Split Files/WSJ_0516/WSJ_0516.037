   Your April 16 page-one story "Steady Inflation: Does
Anyone Care?" suggests that "perhaps most Americans are
correct not to care about inflation."
   In a highly intensive and largely mature economy, with 80%
of our GNP comprising services, inflation of 4.5% is not
manageable, it is pernicious. It causes a small percentage of
our people to get temporarily rich and a big percentage to
become permanently poor. It has impoverished and greatly
eroded the core of our middle class and established a
propensity among us to spend rather than to save, to
speculate rather than to invest and to lose respect for the
hard-earned dollar.

   Inflation is the worst form of taxation. As our Fed
appears, at least, to be committed to fight inflation, we
should see to it that it has many allies.
