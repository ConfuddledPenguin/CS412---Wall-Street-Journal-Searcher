   Medtronic Inc. made what it called a "friendly offer" to
acquire Bio-Medicus Inc. through a stock swap that values
Bio-Medicus at about $167.8 million. Both companies are based
in Minneapolis.
   Medtronic, a biomedical devices maker, owns 5.5% of
Bio-Medicus, which makes blood pumps used in open-heart
surgery. Under the bid, Bio-Medicus holders would receive one
Medtronic share for each 3.3 Bio-Medicus shares. The bid was
disclosed after the market closed yesterday. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, Medtronic shares closed at
$71.75, up 25 cents; under the 3.3-for-1 exchange plan, this
places an indicated value of $21.74 on Bio-Medicus shares,
which closed unchanged at $16.625 in national
over-the-counter trading.

   Medtronic said its bid is subject to a merger agreement
and approval by regulators and Bio-Medicus holders, among
other conditions. Bio-Medicus said it expects the proposal
will be considered at a regular board meeting scheduled for
tomorrow.
