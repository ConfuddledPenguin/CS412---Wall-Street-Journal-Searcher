   Live Entertainment Inc. said first-quarter net income rose
17%, largely because of about $17 million in Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles videocassette tape sales to Burger King.
   Yesterday, Live shares rose $1.25, to close at $21 a share
in national over-the-counter trading. Live's stock price had
dropped to $13.25 a share following news last August that the
company's chairman and chief executive officer, Jose
Menendez, was slain along with his wife Kitty.

   The Los Angeles-based company, which distributes
videocassettes and sells entertainment software, reported net
income for the first quarter of $1.8 million, or 15 cents a
share, compared with $1.6 million, or 12 cents a share, a
year ago. Sales increased 99% to $148.3 million from $74.6
million last year. The company's weighted average number of
shares outstanding increased to 11.9 million from 10.2
million a year earlier.
   The company said that the quarter's results were reduced
because of a $3.7 million reserve taken on amounts owed its
Lieberman Enterprises unit from Ames Department Stores Inc.,
which has filed for bankruptcy law protection.
