   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve offered more evidence of
continuing weakness in the economy.
   Industrial production dropped 0.4% in April, as the
nation's factories, utilities and mines operated at 83% of
their production capacity, a Fed report said. Factory output
had climbed 0.5% in March, when the operating rate was 83.5%.

   A steep fall in production of cars and trucks was a big
factor in last month's decline, the central bank said. But
production of lumber products, computers, nonferrous metals,
paper, clothing, textiles and many other products also
dropped from the previous month. The only industries showing
significant increases in output were chemicals, petroleum,
iron-and-steel and printing and publishing.
   "In no sense is there strength here," said Maury Harris,
chief economist at PaineWebber Group Inc. in New York.
   The new industrial statistics are the latest in a string
of reports suggesting the economy may be weaker than many
analysts had believed. After slowing severely at the end of
last year, the economy seemed to pick up in the first quarter
of 1990, aided by unusually mild winter weather, which
boosted construction and other economic activity.
   But in April, private-sector employment declined and the
nation's unemployment rate rose for the first time in more
than a year, the Labor Department recently reported. Retail
sales also dropped during the month, and the prices factories
and other producers charge for their goods declined, the
government said.
   The latest numbers were released as a Fed committee was
meeting here to set monetary policy for the next six weeks.
The figures made it even more likely that central-bank
officials would decide to leave interest rates unchanged.
   Until recently, many analysts had come to believe that the
Fed would be inclined to push up interest rates to battle
inflation. But last week's report of a decline in the
producer price index and other signs of slack in the economy,
virtually ended such speculation.
   The drop in industry operating rates is another sign that
price pressures may be easing. When factories operate well
below full capacity, they aren't likely to run into
production snags, shortages and other problems that can lead
to higher prices.
   Economists, however, are reluctant to draw many
conclusions from a single month's reports. The drop in
industrial production last month followed gains of 0.5% in
March and 0.9% in February and a fall of 1% in January.
Manufacturing output was particularly weak in April, falling
0.6%, while output by utilities rose 0.6% during the month
and mining production climbed 0.9%.
   For more than a year, manufacturing has been the softest
segment of the U.S. economy, with the auto industry
particularly weak. In January, the nation's Big Three auto
companies temporarily closed plants and laid off thousands of
workers in an effort to pare bulging inventories of unsold
cars. After selling many vehicles, the companies reopened
factories and rehired workers. But in the aftermath of the
winter's vigorous promotions and buying incentives, car sales
are down, and production is sluggish. In April, output of
motor vehicles and parts plunged 10.3%, the Fed report said.
   Nevertheless, Theodore Tung, chief economist for National
City Corp., in Cleveland, said, "We have good reason to
expect the manufacturing sector will improve as the year
progresses."
   "Overall the sources of strength driving manufacturing are
reasonably good," he said, explaining that consumer spending,
export orders and capital spending by businesses are still
rising.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   The industrial production index for April stood at 108.7%
of the 1987 average.
