   MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- The management consultant firm United
Research said it has sold a majority interest in itself to
Cap Gemini Sogeti, the Paris-based information technology
service company.
   The transaction is part of a pattern of mergers between
consulting firms and information technology firms, said
industry analysts.

   "This is the first time in the world that a major
management consulting firm and a major information technology
firm have joined forces," said David Teiger, United's
chairman. Mr. Teiger declined to disclose terms of the
transaction.
   United Research, which specializes in strategy and
operations consulting, had combined domestic and overseas
revenue last year of $80 million, according to David Lord,
managing editor of Consultant News, a Fitzwilliam, N.H.,
newsletter.
   Cap Gemini had world-wide revenue of $1.3 billion,
including $213 million in this country.
   Mr. Lord said the sale is consistent with similar
marriages of consultants and information technology
companies, including the purchase by Computer Sciences Corp.,
El Segundo, Calif., of the Index Group.
