   WASHINGTON -- The blind trust containing President Bush's
personal investments has risen in value to nearly $1,280,000,
the White House disclosed.
   A year ago, the blind trust had a value of $998,000. As
previously disclosed in Mr. Bush's tax return, the trust
earned $217,000 in taxable and tax-exempt income in 1989, and
had capital gains of $36,000.

disclosure reports. A piece of real estate Mr. Bush owns in
Houston is valued at $81,000.
