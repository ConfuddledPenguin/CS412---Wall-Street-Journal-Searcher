   TIJUANA, Mexico -- As many of the world's former one-party
states rush headlong toward political pluralism, Mexico is
moving more deliberately, gradually opening its political
system, which is marked by the longest reign of a single
political party in the noncommunist world.
   Last July citizens of the Mexican state of Baja California
Norte elected Ernesto Ruffo as Mexico's first opposition
governor in 60 years of rule by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The victory of Mr. Ruffo, of the
conservative National Action Party, or PAN, was seen as a
step toward a system like that of India, where the ruling
party allows the opposition to control some regions.

   But in Baja, ingrained attitudes are proving hard to
change. Mexico's wild west has long been dominated by
gangsterish political strongmen, known as caciques. That
tradition of arbitrary, top-down rule is anathema to the
unassuming Mr. Ruffo, whose motto is "less government and
more society."
   Mr. Ruffo, a 37-year-old former corporate executive, has
emphasized good-government reforms within the bureaucracy.
The racketeering chief of the judicial police has been
jailed. Policemen are now required to take drug tests.
Traffic-fine collections have soared, possibly because
motorists think twice about bribing cops, who evidently think
twice about accepting bribes. Tax collections have more than
doubled.
   What's more, Mr. Ruffo has enjoyed surprising rapport with
the PRI-dominated federal government, which was expected to
harass the breakaway state at every turn. "I've found
communication at all levels," says Mr. Ruffo, who has had
more trouble with rifts within the PAN.
   But there's a sense of disillusionment in Baja. It's
visible on Tijuana's manic Boulevard Agua Caliente, where a
bankrupt toyshop shaped like a medieval castle has its mock
drawbridge chained shut. A sign appeals for help from the
governor -- not from customers. It's also evident in a poll
by the political magazine Zeta, which showed a decline in Mr.
Ruffo's popularity since his electoral triumph, though it
also showed him winning if the election were held again.
   "I think the people have very great expectations, they
want immediate results," says Mr. Ruffo. "But there's no
money."
   The state budget is tight as a drum, the result of the
country's economic crisis and the entrenched PRI patronage
system. Mr. Ruffo's budget makers say the public sector is
about 30% overmanned, with most posts protected by PRI-linked
unions. As a result, more than half the state budget goes to
payroll and only 11% to public works urgently needed in
Mexico's fastestgrowing state.
   Mr. Ruffo learned to slip out of such fiscal traps in his
prior post as mayor of the port of Ensenada. When enemies in
the PRI-controlled state government cut off the city's
funding, Mr. Ruffo took his program of government to the
streets. He made the most of an obscure law allowing the
government to solicit funds for refurbishing neighborhoods if
80% of residents assented. Residents were skeptical, but
eventually chipped in so much money that Ensenada paved more
streets than all the cities in the rest of the state
combined.
   In one middle-class barrio of Ensenada, Jose Maria Perez
looks with satisfaction on a new cement street. "To get
support as our mayor, Ruffo fixed the streets," he says. "But
to get support as governor, he must show he wants to fix this
whole corrupt system."
   For Mr. Ruffo's do-it-yourself brand of democracy to take
hold outside his hometown, many analysts say he must prove
himself a bigger man than the caciques suspected of
complicity in two much talked-about criminal cases: a
misappropriation of government funds and a murder of a
prominent reporter.
   A recent audit of deficit-ridden state finances confirmed
that the previous government had funneled about $9 million in
state funds into the PRI's gubernatorial campaign. "So many
people could have had a house, drainage, electricity," says
Mr. Ruffo.
   So far, some midlevel budget officials of the prior
administration have been prosecuted. But 81% of respondents
in the Zeta poll thought former governors should also be
called to account. Mr. Ruffo says he will pursue the
investigation wherever it leads, though he frets about
possible confrontation with the federal government.
   An equally delicate problem is the murder two years ago of
the state's most prominent political columnist, Hector Felix
Miranda. A worker at the local race track has been detained
as the alleged triggerman. But public scrutiny has focused on
the track's operator, Jorge Hank Rhon, a frequent target of
the columnist's barbs. The case has profound political
overtones because Mr. Hank Rhon is the son of Carlos Hank
Gonzalez, Mexico's agriculture minister, and one of the most
powerful political bosses in the country.
   "Because of the people that are in the spotlight of this
problem, it's probable that it's going to cause very intense
political problems," says Mr. Ruffo, who insists he won't
allow the case to die.
   Residents of Baja aren't so sure. Only 24% of respondents
to the Zeta poll think the murder will be solved.
