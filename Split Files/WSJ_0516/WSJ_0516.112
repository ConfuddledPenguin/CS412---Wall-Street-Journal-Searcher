   WASHINGTON -- The White House painted a bleaker picture of
the federal deficit outlook, telling congressional leaders
that it now projects the fiscal 1991 budget gap at between
$128 billion and $140 billion -- even if the costs of the
thrift cleanup are excluded.
   The new estimate came as President Bush convened the first
session in bipartisan talks aimed at avoiding
across-the-board spending cuts this fall and reaching a
multi-year accord to sharply reduce the deficit.

   All sides declared the one-hour, 40-minute session at the
White House a success, and negotiators agreed to meet again
tomorrow at the Capitol for a more detailed presentation on
the scope of the deficit problem.
   The White House has steadily enlarged its projection of
the deficit, blaming higher-than-expected interest rates and
a shortfall in federal revenues. But some Democrats are
skeptical of that explanation. "It appears quite likely at
this point that the current `crisis' was brought about by
poor performance by the administration's economic forecasters
rather than poor performance by the economy," the House
Democratic Study Group said.
   Three and a half months ago, the administration projected
that without any changes in government policy, the deficit
for the year beginning Oct. 1 would be $100.5 billion. In
March, White House Budget Director Richard Darman told a
congressional committee that a slowing economy meant the
deficit would be between $106 billion and $115 billion. And
he told reporters little more than three weeks ago that he
had increased his estimate to between $108 billion and $120
billion.
   Automatic spending cuts will be triggered in October if
Congress fails to reduce the deficit to within $10 billion of
the $64 billion target in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law. The new estimates, disclosed by congressional
negotiators, suggest that negotiators need to find spending
cuts, tax increases or some combination of both totaling
between $54 billion and $66 billion to avoid the cuts -- even
if they agree to ignore the tens of billions of dollars in
added borrowing for the thrift cleanup.
   Economists outside the administration said that despite a
significant surge in interest rates early this year, the
near-term economic outlook hasn't changed much in the past
few months. The consensus of private forecasts for the next
two years actually has turned a tad more bullish since
January, according to a survey by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, an Arizona newsletter.
   "What has really happened is that the optimism embedded in
the administration's (earlier) forecast seems less likely to
be realized," said Robert Reischauer, director of the
Congressional Budget Office. The administration had forecast
falling interest rates throughout this year and next. But
rates have risen, and administration officials now fear that
further increases in interest rates around the world could
lead to a recession before the 1992 election.
   Some Democrats welcomed what they described as new candor
from the administration. "Finally, a healthy dose of reality
has made itself manifest," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.),
one of the Democratic budget negotiators. "You can't solve a
problem without admitting that it exists."
   The White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Bush
told the negotiators that his call for a summit wasn't
prompted by any immediate crisis. Rather, Mr. Bush said that
it's important to act while the economy is still growing "for
growth is not as strong or secure as it should be."
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said
he and Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) told Mr. Bush that
after hearing "a more detailed and precise definition of the
problem," they want the administration to make suggestions
for addressing it before Democrats make proposals of their
own.
   Mr. Bush didn't agree to that, however, and one
participant said that the president suggested that such an
approach wouldn't be constructive. Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole (R., Kan.) said that the success of the talks would
be in doubt if Democrats stuck to that position.
   Speaker Foley and Sen. Dole said that the next few
sessions probably will be devoted to detailing the deficit
and the scope of the across-the-board budget cuts that will
occur if the talks break down. Mr. Bush won't attend, and
Speaker Foley and Sen. Mitchell aren't likely to make more
than token appearances.
   After a week of speculation over who would or wouldn't
propose increasing taxes, no one uttered the word "taxes" at
yesterday's session, Speaker Foley said.
