   U S West Inc. said it will invest about $35 million to
develop "self-healing" telephone networks in five cities by
mid-1991.
   Self-healing systems are designed to ensure continuity of
service in case of fire, earthquake or other disruption.
Using loops of optical-fiber cable with huge capacity, they
are aimed at major corporations, government agencies and
long-distance carriers that need to move large amounts of
voice and data traffic.

   U S West's plan underscores a new industry priority for
emergency-recovery systems. Stakes have escalated since a
fire gutted an Illinois Bell Telephone Co. building in
Hinsdale, Ill., in June 1988, knocking out service to 35,000
customers. A few months ago, a long-distance network collapse
at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. heightened the sense of
urgency.
   Illinois Bell's parent, Ameritech, announced plans last
month to invest about $100 million over the next two years to
build self-healing networks in seven of its major markets.
AT&amp;T, meanwhile, is spending aggressively to strengthen the
digital "backup" of its network.
   U S West's plans call for building separate fiber systems
to serve about 200 large office buildings and work complexes
in Minneapolis-St. Paul; Denver; Portland, Ore.; Seattle; and
Phoenix, Ariz. The undertaking represents the Denver-based
company's largest product announcement since the breakup of
the Bell system in 1984.
   "This is really our bread-and-butter business. Our
customers can't afford even one minute of downtime," said Bob
Hawk, president of the carrier and information provider
division of U S West's telephone unit.
   Mr. Hawk said plans call for laying a total of more than
180 miles of fiber-optic cable to provide "alternate-route
protection" in the five cities. Guarantees of uninterrupted
phone service will be offered: If any outage occurs, the
customer would receive one month of free service from U S
West, Mr. Hawk said.
   For a single circuit with five miles of alternate-route
protection, U S West proposes to charge about $626 a month.
More elaborate circuitry designed to serve multiple locations
as a private network is likely to cost $25,000 to $46,000 a
month or more.
   For example, International Business Machines Corp. has
hired U S West to install a private version of the
self-healing network at IBM's world-wide computer network hub
in Boulder, Colo. The Boulder center links about 250,000
computer terminals.
   The structure of self-healing networks differs
significantly from that of the regular phone network. In a
regular network, central offices are generally linked
singlefile, like a string of beads. In such an arrangement,
any major problem along the cable or in a central office can
interrupt telephone service down the line.
   At the time of the Hinsdale fire, for instance, the
Ameritech unit's switching station was equipped to shift
automatically only 25% of its load to other hubs. Although
repair crews worked around the clock, service to some
Illinois customers couldn't be restored for a couple of
weeks.
   In contrast, the self-healing network links central
offices with optical-fiber cable in loops, or rings. Central
offices are equipped with a special switch that duplicates
signals and sends them simultaneously in opposite directions,
ensuring that at least one arrives -- even during a
disruption at a point along the ring.
