   PARIS -- Consumer prices among the world's industrial
countries rose an average 0.7% in March after a 0.6% increase
in February, despite slower growth in food prices and
declining energy costs, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
   For the 12 months to March, OECD consumer prices rose
6.5%, up from February's year-on-year rise of 6.4%.

   The "underlying" inflation rate, excluding food and energy
costs, edged up to 0.6% from 0.5%. The underlying rate during
the 12 months to March was 4.7%, up from 4.5% in February.
