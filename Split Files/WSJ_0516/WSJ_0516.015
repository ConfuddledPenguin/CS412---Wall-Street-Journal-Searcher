   When Boston Mayor Ray Flynn arrives at City Hall on May
30, both he and his breath will be in short pants. It's hoped
that thousands of others will report for work the same way.
   It's all to decide whether Boston or Montreal is in better
shape.

   Never mind that Massachusetts's economy is winded. When it
comes to fitness, it's going to be physical, not fiscal, that
counts. The winner on this otherwise normal workday will be
the city that gets the most people to exercise for 15
continuous minutes.
   Last year, in the first showdown between the two, Boston
lost by 420,868 to 248,328. Consequently, Montreal's flag
flew over Boston City Hall for three days.
   But this year, Boston has prepared a cardiovascular
circus. Jogging gurus will head hearty jaunts around town.
Also planned are stair climbing, street hockey, vigorous
table tennis and what's billed as the world's largest
aerobics class to be held on a red stone mesa at the city's
sprawling civic center. Power walking counts, but window
shopping doesn't.
   Afterward, participants are to phone the YMCA with this
brief message: "I exercised for 15 minutes today."
   "If we can get 500,000 to aerobicize, I think we can beat
Montreal," declares an upbeat Gerdy Weiss, a Greater Boston
YMCA director and event coordinator.
   Bean Towners are eager to win.
   Northeastern University, for instance, is offering a
recreation class aimed chiefly at helping to publicize the
event -- students lick envelopes and send out fliers. And
even some Boston hockey fans aren't hoping for a sweep
against the Edmondton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Championship
Series. "If the Boston Bruins go into a fifth game, it will
be played on May 30 and we could include 26 more names on the
list," muses Dennis McKenna, a Boston Stock Exchange trader
and lifelong Bruins rooter.
   Further flexing its aerobic capacity, Boston is
dispatching its flag 400 miles to Montreal via a solo
bicyclist.
   A Montreal official chuckles when told of Boston's
resolve.
   "We want to win, too," says Marielle Seguin, assistant
chief of staff for Montreal's mayor. "They beat us in the
Stanley Cup playoffs." But when asked whether Montreal also
plans to bicycle its flag to Boston, Ms. Sequin says: "No,
no. We send our flag by plane. But in Boston we do some
walking."
