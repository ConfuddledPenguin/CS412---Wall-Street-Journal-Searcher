   Southern Progress Corp., a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc.,
said it will close down its Southpoint magazine, a regional
magazine for southern states.
   Southpoint, a general interest monthly magazine, will
cease publication with its June issue. Don Logan, chief
executive officer of Southern Progress Corp., said the
magazine is being folded because it wasn't drawing enough
advertising or new paid circulation.

   Staff members of Southpoint, based in Atlanta, were
stunned by the news. "Obviously I am deeply disappointed that
the commitment to Southpoint proved to be so fleeting," said
John Huey, editor of Southpoint.
   A publisher of several profitable magazines such as
Southern Living and Southern Accents, the Birmingham,
Ala.-based Southern Progress said it will shift focus from
Southpoint to new advertising packages that include Sunset
magazine, another regional magazine. Sunset, a
large-circulation life style magazine in the western states,
was acquired by Time Warner in March for $225 million.
   Hoping to expand its franchise in the South, Southern
Progress acquired 70% of Southpoint, then known as Southern
magazine, in March 1989. The remaining 30% of the magazine is
owned by Stephens Inc., the Little Rock, Ark.-based
investment banking firm, which originally bankrolled the
magazine when it was launched in 1986.
