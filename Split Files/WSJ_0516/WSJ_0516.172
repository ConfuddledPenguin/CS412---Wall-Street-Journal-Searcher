   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. said it paid more
than $1.33 billion in the first quarter to holders
surrendering insurance policies and annuities, creating a
vast cash outflow for the insurance holding company.
   However, company officials said the tide of policy
surrenders slowed markedly this month and in April. The
officials added that company reserves of cash and short-term
securities totaled $2.4 billion as of March 31, enough "to
meet any foreseeable policyholder obligations in a timely
manner."

   A bulge in policy surrenders had been expected at First
Executive, whose $859 million fourth-quarter write-down of
junk bonds stirred policyholder concerns about its financial
health. But the latest figure is more than twice the $559
million of payments for surrendered policies earlier reported
for January and February. The sharp difference suggests that
requests for surrenders didn't necessarily rise in March, but
that payments resulting from earlier requests swelled at the
end of the quarter.
   The disclosure of surrender volume was made in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing with the company's
first-quarter results.
   The company earned $45.4 million, or 32 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $44.1 million, or 52 cents a
share, a year earlier. The year-earlier result included a
$112 million pretax write-down of First Executive's
investment in its insurance unit, which was partially offset
by a one-time gain of $55.8 million for an accounting change.
Revenue climbed 24% to $554.5 million from $448.1 million.
   First Executive said that, given its financial condition
and outlook, its board "will periodically review the
continued advisability of paying preferred stock dividends."
In the first quarter, First Executive paid $10.8 million in
dividends to holders of three classes of preferred stock.
   As previously reported, First Executive has hired First
Boston Corp. to explore a financial restructuring that could
include the sale of one or more of its operating units. Among
other things, the company said in its filing, it had been
considering a sale of more common stock. That proposal was
opposed by a major shareholder, First Executive said, without
naming the holder.
   The company's quarterly report was filed after the market
close. First Executive stock closed at $2.875, unchanged, in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Details in the SEC filing show that First Executive
continued a major reworking of its investment portfolio,
selling long-term securities and stocks and maximizing
liquidity. The company said it sold about $1.58 billion net
amount of securities in the latest quarter, including $1.33
billion of bonds and preferred stock and $232 million of
equities.
   First Executive's remaining investments include bonds with
a book value of $11.59 billion but a market value of about
$1.57 billion lower and equities with a cost of $603.7
million and a market value of $605.5 million.
   First Executive warned that, should surrenders resume at
first-quarter levels, it could be compelled to sell
securities and realize further capital losses.

   FIRST EXECUTIVE Corp. intended to seek approval of an
increase in its authorized capital stock at its annual
meeting later this year. The plan met with objections from a
major shareholder. Wednesday's edition incorrectly said the
company had been considering a sale of common stock.
