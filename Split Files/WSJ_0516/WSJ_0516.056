   The '80s Materialism
   Marks American Youth

   YOUNG AMERICANS have become far more materialistic and far
less idealistic since the mid-1970s.
   Two complementary analyses were presented at a recent
meeting of the Population Association of America in Toronto.
Both drew on annual surveys of high school seniors taken by
the University of Michigan and of college freshmen conducted
by the University of California, Los Angeles.
   Eileen Crimmins and colleagues at the University of
Southern California reported that the desire for a life style
of more goods and more leisure has increased "substantially"
since 1976. More young men and women now consider it
extremely important or quite important to have at least two
cars, the latest clothes, a high-quality stereo, a vacation
home.
   Fewer think it important to "help others," "correct social
and economic inequalities," or "develop a meaningful
philosophy of life."
   The young people, Ms. Crimmins said, want their own
children to have better opportunities than they did, but
again think in terms of possessions. Between 1976 and 1986,
there was a 15% drop in high school seniors believing fathers
need to spend more time with their kids, and a 27% drop in
those believing mothers should. "They are substituting goods
for inputs of their time," Ms. Crimmins observed.
   Margaret Marini of the University of Minnesota said
females have become almost indistinguishable from males in
voicing aspirations for high-paying, prestigious jobs and
administrative responsibility over others. In 1986, for
example, 28% of the male high school seniors and 26% of the
females said they'd like to work in a large corporation.
                                                                                                       

   The Job Scene Drives
   Men From Families
                                                                                                       

   DECLINING male labor force participation and stagnating
real income for younger men have propelled recent changes in
family structure, according to University of Connecticut
sociologist Jane Riblett Wilkie.
   Her analysis of Census Bureau data shows that in 1988 only
75% of working-age men were actually in the labor force,
compared with 83% in 1960, and that the proportion of
families with men as the sole wage earners had dropped to 15%
from 42%.
   Men 55 and older accounted for about half the total
decline in male work-force participation, Ms. Wilkie says.
She attributes this partly to economic changes that led to
layoffs of older industrial workers and partly to expanded
Social Security and pension coverage that permits more older
men to quit working.
   At the same time, young men have had increasing difficulty
in finding jobs at wages adequate to support a family of four
above the poverty level, Ms. Wilkie reports. This is
particularly true, she notes, for poorly educated men,
including many young blacks and Hispanics.
   The changes in male work patterns, she argues, have
obliged many wives to work to fill out the family income,
swelling the number of multiple-earner families. The changes
also have fueled the surge in female-headed single-parent
families, she says. Unable to support a family, men refuse to
marry the mothers of their children or leave the marriage,
and many women see little value in being married to
low-earners.
                                                                                                       

   Birth-Control Practices
   Vary Little With Faith
                                                                                                       

   MOST RELIGIOUS groups now are about equally likely to
practice birth control, a new analysis indicates. Not long
ago, religious affiliation played a central role in
determining contraceptive use. But answers from more than
8,400 women of childbearing age surveyed by the government in
1988 reveal a changed picture, according to Brown University
sociologist Calvin Goldscheider and William Mosher of the
National Center for Health Statistics.
   Just about three out of every five women of childbearing
age in each major grouping -- Protestants, Catholics, Jews
and those with no affiliation -- said they use some method of
contraception, including sterilization.
   Looking only at married, non-Hispanic whites in this age
bracket, the researchers found three out of four Protestants
and three out of four Catholics practicing contraception.
Only 66% of the Protestants and 57% of the Catholics did in a
1965 survey.
   A major trend has been a sharp increase in sterilization
for both Protestants and Catholics. In 1988, 34% of the
married, white, non-Hispanic Protestant women between 15 and
44 had been sterilized for contraceptive reasons, and another
20% were protected by their husbands having been sterilized.
Among Catholics, 22% of the women and 21% of the husbands had
been sterilized. In 1965, none of these four numbers was
above 7%.
   Members of all religious groups sharply cut back use of
intra-uterine devices over the past 15 years, and pill use
also declined. Catholic use of the rhythm method fell from
32% of the 1965 sample to only 4% by 1988.
   The 1988 survey showed blacks and Hispanics of all
religions with higher levels of female sterilization than
non-Hispanic whites, but sharply lower male sterilization.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MOTHERS FEEL less anxious or guilty about going back to
work after the birth of their second child than they did
after the first, reports Martha Pitzer, a professor of
nursing at Ohio State University. . . . Almost two out of
five patients who have had a skin cancer surgically removed
still refuse to use any sort of sunscreen, according to
research by Dr. June Robinson of the Northwestern University
Medical School.
