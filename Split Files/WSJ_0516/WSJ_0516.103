   Leaders of the Amalgamated Transit Union say they may
press Greyhound Lines Inc. for back pay for their striking
members as a result of a National Labor Relations Board
complaint accusing the bus company of engaging in an unfair
labor practice in contract negotiations.
   More than 9,400 Greyhound employees represented by the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU's
bargaining unit, have been on strike since March 2.

   On Monday, NLRB General Counsel Jerry Hunter authorized
the issuance of a complaint alleging that Greyhound, a unit
of Dallas-based GLI Holding Co., unilaterally implemented
some of its contract proposals before reaching a bargaining
impasse with the union. "The complaint will also allege that
the current strike is an unfair labor practice strike," the
NLRB said in a news release.
   If unfair bargaining practices and not economic issues are
found to have caused the strike, Greyhound could be forced to
rehire thousands of striking ATU drivers it has replaced with
new hires since the strike began. The company has said that,
even if a settlement is reached, it has jobs for only a few
hundred of the nearly 6,000 ATU drivers still out.
   Though no new bargaining talks have been scheduled, Edward
Strait, president of the ATU's Amalgamated Council, said ATU
local presidents would discuss offering to go back to work
under the terms of their now-expired contract at a meeting
May 21. Mr. Strait said that if Greyhound turns down such an
offer the company might eventually be forced to pay striking
drivers back pay if the NLRB general counsel's complaint is
upheld.
   "This could be quite costly to them down the road," Mr.
Strait said.
   Still, the ultimate resolution of the NLRB complaint could
be years away. Both sides will now argue the complaint before
a federal administrative law judge. The judge's decision can
be appealed by either party to the entire labor relations
board and their decision can, in turn, be appealed through
the federal courts.
   "We are confident we will prevail," said Greyhound
Executive Vice President P. Anthony Lannie. "We will appeal
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, should that become
necessary."
   Meanwhile, Greyhound officials said they were pleased that
Mr. Hunter, the NLRB general counsel, also authorized the
issuance of a second complaint, this one alleging that the
union had engaged in violence and other forms of misconduct
during the strike. Mr. Hunter said he had obtained clearance
from the board to seek a federal court injunction enjoining
the union from such conduct nationwide.
   Since the strike began, Greyhound has spent more than $4
million on legal fees to obtain such injunctions and
restraining orders in individual cities and states. The
increased costs of legal fees and security were among the
reasons Greyhound cited for a $55.8 million net loss during
the first quarter. The debt-burdened company is currently
negotiating with creditors and lenders on a financial
restructuring.
