   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, anxious to free up
its $720 million aid package for Central America, is quietly
throwing support to a bid by Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Robert Byrd to add $185 million for a crime facility
in his state of West Virginia.
   The maneuvering appears to be part of an effort to strike
a legislative alliance with the powerful chairman. It also
reflects Budget Director Richard Darman's penchant for
pork-barrel politics even as he argues for a line-item veto
to reduce the deficit. The proposed facility -- a national
fingerprint repository for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation -- could cost at least twice the initial $185
million inserted by Mr. Byrd. In remarks early this month,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made reference to the item
as a example of how Congress adds unrequested appropriations
to spending bills.

   Though state and local police forces have lobbied for a
fingerprint facility, no money was requested by the
administration in either the current supplemental 1990
spending bill of more than $3.3 billion or the FBI's budget
for fiscal 1991, beginning Oct. 1. In a letter this month to
the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Darman listed the
Byrd amendment among the many "unrequested provisions" adding
to discretionary spending. But his office has now sanctioned
an appeal by FBI Director William Sessions for the money.
   Mr. Sessions, artfully choosing his words, describes the
item as an "emergency supplemental" to avoid "the dire
consequences of a lack of one central system." The letter was
cleared with the Office of Management and Budget and
substantially strengthens Mr. Byrd's position as talks resume
today with the House on the underlying bill.
   The Central America funding -- $420 million for Panama and
$300 million for Nicaragua -- isn't in dispute. But a major
question is whether the appropriations panels will attach
necessary legislative waivers sought by the State Department
so the money can be quickly distributed. President Bush
personally telephoned House Speaker Thomas Foley this week,
but House liberals have balked at releasing the Central
America funds until the administration agrees to impose
conditions on separate military aid to El Salvador.
   Mr. Foley signaled a willingness yesterday to move
substantially toward the administration's position, but he
may have conceded more than many Democrats are prepared to
accept. The question could be tested in a floor fight as
early as tomorrow and -- whatever alliances are struck with
Mr. Byrd in the appropriations negotiations -- a final
arbiter is House Rules Committee Chairman Joseph Moakley, who
can slow the Panama and Nicaragua funding if no agreement is
reached on El Salvador. "They will still have to come to me,"
said the Massachusetts Democrat.
