   MANILA, the Philippines -- The government, in an action
that was more procedural than threatening, served official
notice to terminate in September 1991 the current 25-year
agreement governing U.S. military installations in the
Philippines.
   The notice, which paves the way for a possible new bases
accord, came yesterday during the second day of talks in
Manila on the future of the six U.S. bases in the
Philippines: Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Station and four
smaller installations. Clark and Subic are Washington's
biggest overseas military facilities.

   Both sides emphasized that the notice doesn't necessarily
mean that the bases will leave the Philippines after
September 1991. "The serving of this notice of termination
doesn't preclude a new agreement," said Stanley Schrager, a
spokesman for the U.S. negotiating team. President Corazon
Aquino said during a news conference: "We felt that since the
bases talks have begun, this would be a good opportunity" to
serve notice.
   Diplomats and other political analysts said the move was
expected and noted that it served several purposes:
fulfilling a domestic legal requirement, appeasing
nationalist sentiment, and enabling the Philippine government
to ensure that the current agreement doesn't extend
indefinitely.
   Manila's constitution stipulates that foreign bases aren't
allowed in the Philippines after September 1991 except under
a new treaty. The present agreement requires a one-year
termination notice, even after the 1991 expiration date.
   The future of the bases looms as the Philippines's biggest
foreign-policy decision and one with far-reaching political
implications. For those who support continued U.S. presence,
the bases are essential to the country's prosperity. But for
many of those opposed to a new agreement, removing the bases
is a prerequisite for national sovereignty, and necessary for
breaking the links to a colonial past.
   The bases issue is highly divisive for a country already
fragmented along social, economic and political lines. On
Sunday, the eve of the talks, two U.S. airmen were shot dead
outside Clark Air Base. Yesterday, the communist New People's
Army claimed responsibility and warned it might target other
Americans.
   While the notice may satisfy some Philippine domestic
considerations, it doesn't necessarily resolve the legal
complexities surrounding the date the bases can't any longer
function under the current agreement. The U.S. continues to
maintain that unless both sides agree to either a new compact
or an earlier end for the old agreement, the 1966 accord
would actually lapse in 1992. This assumes the 25-year
agreement plus one year for termination.
   But few analysts believe negotiations will drag on until
the disputed cutoff date. Mr. Schrager said preliminary talks
could end in one week, after which the two sides could agree
to negotiate a new treaty -- though that could take months.
