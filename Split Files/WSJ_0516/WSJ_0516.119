   OAKLAND, Calif. -- On the eve of the 1986 leveraged
buy-out of Safeway Stores Inc., the board of directors sat
down to a last supper. Peter Magowan, the boyish-looking
chairman and chief executive of the world's largest
supermarket chain, rose to offer a toast to the deal that had
fended off a hostile takeover by the corporate raiders
Herbert and Robert Haft.
   "Through your efforts, a true disaster was averted," the
44-year-old Mr. Magowan told the other directors. By selling
the publicly held company to a group headed by buy-out
specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and members of
Safeway management, "you have saved literally thousands of
jobs in our work force," Mr. Magowan said. "All of us --
employees, customers, shareholders -- have a great deal to be
thankful for."

   Nearly four years later, Mr. Magowan and the KKR group can
indeed count their blessings. While they borrowed heavily to
buy Safeway from the shareholders, last month they sold 10%
of the company (but none of their own shares) back to the
public -- at a price that values their own collective stake
at more than $800 million, more than four times their cash
investment.
   Employees, on the other hand, have considerably less
reason to celebrate. Mr. Magowan's toast notwithstanding,
63,000 managers and workers were cut loose from Safeway,
through store sales or layoffs. While the majority were
re-employed by their new store owners, this was largely at
lower wages, and many thousands of Safeway people wound up
either unemployed or forced into the part-time work force. A
survey of former Safeway employees in Dallas found that
nearly 60% still hadn't found full-time employment more than
a year after the layoff.
   James White, a Safeway trucker for nearly 30 years in
Dallas, was among the 60%. In 1988, he marked the one-year
anniversary of his last shift at Safeway this way: First he
told his wife he loved her, then he locked the bathroom door,
loaded his .22-caliber hunting rifle and blew his brains out.
   "Safeway was James's whole life," says his widow, Helen.
"He'd near stand up and salute whenever one of those trucks
went by." When Safeway dismissed him, she says, "it was like
he turned into a piece of stone."
   Few financial maneuvers have drawn more controversy than
the leveraged buy-out, or LBO, a relatively old money-making
tactic that was dusted off and put to extensive use in the
1980s, thanks largely to the rise of junk-bond financing.
   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors that
generally includes senior management borrows heavily to buy a
company from public shareholders and takes it private. The
debt is to be rapidly repaid from the company's own cash flow
or from sales of its assets.
   The returns on some such highly leveraged investments have
been astronomical, enriching such financiers as Henry Kravis,
Ronald Perelman and Nelson Peltz to a degree unheard of since
the days of the Robber Barons. Proponents of LBOs argue that
they are good for business and good for America, triggering
long-overdue crash weight-loss programs for flabby
corporations. By placing ownership in the hands of a small
group of investors and managers with a powerful debt-driven
incentive to improve productivity, the argument goes,
companies can't help but shape up.
   The Safeway LBO is often cited as one of the most
successful in this regard. It brought shareholders a
substantial premium at the outset, and since then the company
has raised productivity and operating profits and produced
riches for the new investors and top management. "We could
not have done what we did do without going through the
incredible trauma and pressure of the LBO," Mr. Magowan said
in late 1988.
   But while much has been written about the putative
benefits of LBOs, little has been said about the hundreds of
thousands of people directly affected by the past decade's
buy-out binge: employees of the bought-out corporations. In
the case of Safeway, a two-month investigation of the buy-out
reveals enormous human costs and unintended side effects. The
company dropped tens of thousands of employees from its
payroll, suppliers and other dependent industries laid off
hundreds more, and communities lost the civic contributions
of a firm whose first store had been opened by a clergyman
who wanted to help his parishioners save money.
   When Safeway itself selected a group of its employees to
speak to this newspaper on behalf of the company, not one of
those interviewed praised the buy-out. "I think LBOs are very
ugly," said Carl Adkins, an inventory control clerk who
described himself as happy with his job. "I think they are
harmful to individual working people. I think they honestly
stink."
   Moreover, the evidence doesn't entirely support the
argument that the LBO made Safeway a healthier institution.
The supermarket chain cut plenty of muscle with the fat, both
from its holdings and from its labor force, and deferred
capital improvements in favor of the all-consuming debt. Many
employees find the post-LBO working environment more
difficult -- as a company legendary for job security and
fairness resorts to hardball labor policies and high-pressure
quota systems.
   Just before the Safeway deal was struck in 1986, Mr.
Magowan's mother grew worried about the employees. The
supermarket dowager wanted to be sure the LBO wouldn't damage
Safeway's longstanding reputation as a benevolent employer.
   Will anyone get hurt? Mrs. Magowan pressed her son at the
time, according to company staff members. Will anyone lose
his job?
   No Mom, Mr. Magowan promised, according to the staffers'
account. No one will get hurt.
   "Yes, I was greatly concerned about the people," Mrs.
Magowan recalls today, in her mansion overlooking the San
Francisco Bay. She declines to comment further.
   Mr. Magowan's recollection: "Well, I don't ever remember
such a conversation ever occurred. . . . I might have said
things like, `We're going to do the best we can for our
employees and I'm hopeful that we are going to be able to
keep the vast majority with the new owners.'"
   In any event, before that summer was out, Mrs. Magowan's
son had begun firing Safeway employees. Not long after,
Safeway replaced its longtime motto, "Safeway Offers
Security." The new corporate statement, displayed on a plaque
in the lobby at corporate headquarters, reads in part:
"Targeted Returns on Current Investment."
   ---
   Before the LBO, Safeway was hardly a prime example of the
sluggish, out-of-shape sort of company that LBO proponents
like to target. Founded in 1926, it had grown under Magowan
family leadership to encompass more than 2,000 stores in 29
states and in England, Australia, Canada and Mexico. Mr.
Magowan's father, Robert, had largely built Safeway, and his
mother, Doris Merrill Magowan, is the daughter of a founder
of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which helped finance Safeway's
growth.
   Many companies, including Safeway, had allowed their
payrolls to become bloated in certain underperforming
divisions, and layoffs were common throughout large American
companies during the last decade.
   But Safeway was already doing -- albeit at a slower pace
-- many of the things LBO experts advocate. It was remodeling
its stores and creating the upscale "superstores" that have
now proved such a big success. It was experimenting with
employee productivity teams, phasing out money-losing
divisions, and thinning its work force with a program that
included some layoffs but generally relied on less painful
methods like attrition.
   All these changes produced earnings that more than doubled
in the first four years of the 1980s, to a record $231
million in 1985. The stock price tripled in three years, and
dividends climbed four years in a row.
   But all that wasn't enough for takeover-crazed Wall
Street, where virtually no company was invulnerable to
cash-rich corporate raiders. When the deep-pocketed Hafts
began buying Safeway shares in the open market and then
offered to buy the company for as much as $64 a share,
management felt it had to take defensive action. Selling to
the Hafts might have cost Chairman Magowan his job and, he
felt, ultimately might have brought a breakup of the company.
   Safeway considered and rejected a plan to fend off the
Hafts through a so-called recapitalization. This was a move
that its supermarket-industry competitor, Kroger Co. would
use two years later to keep the same raiders at bay while
allowing shareholders to realize a big one-time gain.
   The decision to sell to KKR instead brought immediate
benefits to some. Shareholders got $67.50 a share -- 82% more
than the stock was trading at three months before -- plus
warrants that give them a 5.6% stake in the ongoing company.
Employees owned roughly 10% of Safeway shares at the time of
the buy-out.
   Mr. Magowan and other directors and top executives
received $28 million for their shares, $5.7 million of which
went to Mr. Magowan. He and about 60 other top executives
also got options to buy a total of 10% of the new Safeway at
only $2 a share; those options are now valued at more than
$100 million, or $12.125 a share.
   The Hafts made $100 million by selling the Safeway shares
they had accumulated to KKR, and as a consolation prize, they
were also given options to buy a 20% stake in the new
Safeway. The Hafts sold that option back to KKR 2 1/2 months
later for an additional $59 million.
   The three investment banks that worked on the deal made a
total of $65 million. Law and accounting firms shared another
$25 million.
   And then there are Henry Kravis, George Roberts, about a
dozen other KKR employees and the 70 investors KKR brought
into the buy-out. KKR itself charged Safeway $60 million in
fees just to put the deal together. The five KKR partners
then put up a small fraction of the equity funding -- 1.1%,
or roughly $2 million -- and received a 20% share of the
eventual profits from any sale of Safeway.
   KKR's investor group, half of which consists of state
pension funds and which also includes banks, insurance
companies and even Harvard University, got most of the rest.
   Mr. Roberts rebutts the notion that too few people really
benefit in an LBO. He says that some of "our 70 limited
partners represent retired teachers, sanitation workers and
firemen, and 80% of our profits go to them."
   But at the largest of those investors, Oregon's
public-employee pension fund, LBO investments make up only a
tiny portion of investments and thus haven't had "a
significant impact" on retirees' benefits to date, according
to Bob Andrews, fund manager.
   ---
   The immediate gains for some triggered immediate costs for
others. The first employees to be fired shortly after the
buy-out's completion were more than 300 staffers from Oakland
corporate headquarters and a nearby division in Walnut Creek,
Calif. The following spring, the entire Dallas-area division
was shut down, and nearly 9,000 more employees were dismissed
-- employees with an average length of service of 17 years.
   "This is going to kill people," transportation manager
Richard Quigley says he told his boss when he learned that
layoffs would take place.
   On the Friday afternoon before the dismissals went into
effect, Patricia Vasquez, a 14-year systems analyst, heard
that her name was on the list. That evening, Mrs. Vasquez, a
Safeway devotee famous for her refusal to take lunch hours,
packed her service citations in a cardboard box and left
looking pale and drawn. The next morning her two young
children found their single mother on the bathroom floor,
dead of a heart attack.
   That Monday, Mr. Quigley came home with the news that he,
himself, would be fired. His worried wife's blood pressure
began to rise. A diabetic who had been in good health for
years, she was hospitalized by Labor Day weekend -- and dead
by Sept. 5. Rightly or wrongly, Mr. Quigley blames his wife's
death on his Safeway layoff: "She was very traumatized by
it."
   Told of these deaths and several suicides that family
members and friends attribute to the Safeway layoffs, Mr.
Magowan says: "I never heard of this before. If it's true,
I'm obviously sorry about such a tragic thing, but any
attempt to associate this directly with the LBO shows a
disposition to want to believe the worst of LBOs."
   For many at Safeway, firing day was only the first in a
long series of financial and emotional body blows.
   "The dominoes began to tumble and they crashed for a long
time to come," says Ron Morrison, a former corporate systems
manager. When Mr. Morrison lost his 14-year job, his fiance
announced she couldn't marry an unemployed man.
   He found work as a transportation analyst at Del Monte,
but then KKR bought that company, too -- and he was laid off
again, just before Thanksgiving. By the time 1990 rolled
around, Mr. Morrison had not only gone through two KKR-led
LBOs, he had lost his second home and was unemployed again.
   "Right now I pretty much live in a cocoon," Mr. Morrison
says. "You begin to pull in your tentacles because you can't
afford to have any more cut off."
   While at Safeway, Mr. Morrison says, he helped conduct a
transportation study that trimmed millions from the company
transit budget. And he wasn't the only fired employee at
headquarters whose work had brought the company big savings.
Refrigeration engineer Mikhail Vaynberg, a Soviet emigre,
says he invented a new cooling system for the stores that cut
energy costs 35%, saved $1.6 million a year, and was copied
by many suppliers. (A Safeway spokesman says the company
doesn't contest these cost-saving claims.)
   After he was fired, Mr. Vaynberg couldn't find work in his
field and, like many other employees fired at headquarters,
says he couldn't get a current letter of recommendation from
Safeway; he says his boss told him he wasn't allowed to
supply a written reference because "you might use it to sue
the company." (A Safeway spokesman says it is company policy
not to grant reference letters for "good, sound legal
reasons," but maintains that managers were allowed to make
exceptions for employees laid off in the 1986 firings at
headquarters.)
   Mr. Vaynberg says his greatest blow came a few weeks after
the layoff, when his only son dropped out of engineering
school weeks shy of graduation: "The country doesn't want
engineers: Look what happened to you," he told his father.
Now Mr. Vaynberg, still unemployed, spends his days in a
painfully clean living room, prowls the halls at night and
avoids old friends and neighbors. "I am ashamed," he says,
staring at his big empty hands. "I am like an old thrown-out
mop."
   Safeway fired its corporate employees with no notice, cut
off their medical insurance in as little as two weeks and
provided severance pay of one week's salary for every year of
service, to a maximum of just eight weeks. And to get the
pay, many employees say they were told to sign a letter
waiving their right to contest the severance package later.
(A company spokesman says the letter wasn't a waiver but
simply an "acknowledgment" that they understood the terms.)
   Mr. Magowan concedes that many of the people fired at
headquarters in the summer of 1986 were "very good"
employees. The cuts were made in a hurry, as he said later in
a court deposition, so as "to put this whole unpleasant
matter behind us as soon as possible." For such haste,
Safeway would wind up paying $8.2 million to settle a
wrongful termination class-action suit and $750,000 to settle
a separate suit for age discrimination.
   One executive who left headquarters voluntarily was
accorded much better treatment. Safeway president James
Rowland was granted a $1 million bonus when he retired a few
months after the buy-out.
   Mr. Rowland advised Mr. Magowan in a memo to approve the
bonus privately and divide the amount into smaller portions
with labels like "paid consultant." The reason, as Mr.
Rowland wrote: "Peter, I do not want to put you in an
embarrassing situation."
   (Mr. Rowland, reached at his Arkansas home, says he never
got a "million-dollar bonus. I got my regular bonus. I just
don't recall what it was. I'm not going to go back and rehash
all that." He then hangs up. Mr. Magowan says Mr. Rowland
wasn't paid a lump sum of $1 million. He was paid his
previous year's bonus, which he had earned, plus an advance
on consulting work he would do for Safeway, Mr. Magowan says.
"It wouldn't have been some side deal under the table between
Jim Rowland and me that nobody knew about. That's not my
style.")
   ---
   "I wouldn't be surprised if 11,000 jobs were created out
of" the roughly 9,000 jobs lost, Mr. Magowan announced to the
press after he closed the Dallas division. He says he assumed
that other grocery chains would expand to fill the Safeway
vacuum. "What I'm talking about here is a theory of mine," he
says later. "I will get right up front and say I don't have
facts to support it." Mr. Magowan says he has not been back
to Dallas since the closure.
   When the Dallas division shut down, the state unemployment
office had to open on the weekend -- for the first time ever
-- just to accommodate the Safeway crowds. The Dallas
employees had a thin financial pallet to cushion the blow.
Their severance pay was half a week's pay for each year of
service, up to a maximum of eight weeks.
   And their severance checks didn't start arriving until
July 1987, three months after the shutdown. Russell Webb, a
12-year produce clerk and single father with three children,
didn't get his severance check for eight months. Vacation pay
arrived even more slowly: First the union had to go to
arbitration to get it; then, the company didn't start mailing
the checks until February 1989. Safeway says the severance
and other checks arrived late because they weren't part of
the union contract and thus "had to be negotiated."
   In addition to Mr. White's suicide, at least two others
tried to kill themselves. One was Bill Mayfield Jr., a
mechanic in the Safeway dairy since it opened in 1973, who
slashed his wrists, then shot himself in the stomach; the
bullet just missed his vital organs and he survived.
   "I would say {the layoff} devastated about 80% of the
people in the division," says Gary Jones, president of
Safeway's credit union in Dallas, which eventually had to
write off $4 million in loans. "Overnight we turned from a
lending institution into a collection agency." At one point,
more than 250 repossessed cars were sitting in his parking
lot.
   KKR and Safeway blame organized labor for the fall of the
Dallas division. Once the leading grocer in the area, Safeway
had seen its market share fall by nearly half in the '80s.
KKR and Safeway officials say the company was paying too much
in wages, some 30% more than rivals, thus preventing it from
cutting prices, remodeling stores and the like.
   But rival Kroger was also a union shop, and it found a way
to prosper and expand in Dallas by renovating stores and
negotiating lower wages with the union. Its market share was
on the rise. The Kroger case suggests that the Safeway
layoffs might have been necessitated as much by mismanagement
as by labor costs. Some company officials concede that
Safeway had other problems besides wages in Dallas: Its
stores were too small, too old and poorly designed.
   While grocery competitors in Dallas eventually bought more
than half the 141 Safeway stores, they were less eager to
pick up the unionized workers. According to a state-funded
survey of the displaced workers, stores under new management
typically recalled no more than a half dozen of the 40 to 60
former Safeway employees who staffed each outlet.
   And wages fell sharply, no matter where the workers
landed: In 1988, according to the survey, ex-Safeway
employees reported that their average pay had dropped to
$6.50 from $12.09 an hour.
   Cindy Hale, an 11-year Safeway employee, saw her wages
fall to $4 an hour when she took an identical grocery clerk's
job with AppleTree Markets, at an old Safeway store. Her new
employer would only hire part-time, so Ms. Hale, a single
mother, lost her medical benefits. She eventually lost her
house, too, and had to send her son to live with her parents.
   "But it really wasn't as bad for me as the others," says
Ms. Hale.
   For Dallas employees, working for Safeway had often been a
total family experience, and many households lost more than
one income after the buy-out. The Seabolts lost three:
Husband, wife and daughter all got their pink slips on the
same day. Ron Seabolt, who worked in the company's
distribution center for 17 years, searched for months before
taking a job as a janitor. Now he works at the post office.
   Kay Seabolt, a human resources supervisor at Safeway and a
17-year company veteran, counseled ex-employees for a year
under a state job-placement retraining program. The program's
counselors sometimes fished into their own pockets to buy
groceries for those who streamed through the counseling
center, an abandoned Safeway office. When Safeway sold it,
the new owners evicted them.
   Seared into Mrs. Seabolt's memory is the day one tattered
man arrived at the office. A long-timer in the Safeway bread
plant, the middle-aged baker made his way to her desk with a
slow, wincing limp. He apologized for his appearance,
explaining that he had just walked six miles from the
temporary labor pools: His car had been repossessed. He was
living in a homeless shelter. "I gave him a few job leads,"
she recalls, "but he was pretty shabby and I didn't hold out
much hope." Before he left, she slipped him some money for
bus fare, she says. "I never saw him again."
   When the layoff rumors first began circulating, Clara
Sanchez took to praying in the parking lot of Store No. 677.
Her silent pleas went unanswered. On April 24, 1987, she and
her husband, Jesse, lost their jobs. She had been a checker
for 12 years; he had been an order filler in the warehouse
for 18 years.
   Clara could find no work, and is still unemployed; Jesse
searched for eight months before the city hired him to cut
grass for $3.55 an hour. Then he washed cars for $4.50 an
hour. Two months later, he was laid off. Finally, with
$14,000 in unpaid bills, the Sanchezes filed for bankruptcy.
   The church sent canned goods, and Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez
skipped supper some evenings so their children could eat
better. After a while, Mr. Sanchez was too depressed to eat
anyway. "I wasn't a man; I wasn't worth anything as far as I
was concerned," he says. "Why live if I can't support my
kids?" One Friday night, Mr. Sanchez told his wife he was
going to watch a wrestling match, but went to a friend's
house instead with a business proposition: "I told him I
would pay him $100 to take my life. I didn't own a gun or I
would've done it myself." The friend put his gun out of reach
and sent Mr. Sanchez home.
   When Safeway pulled out of Dallas, the shock waves didn't
stop at the supermarket doors. The shutdown led to secondary
layoffs at almost all the big food and beverage vendors in
town, and some construction businesses suffered. For Harry W.
Parks Co., a general contractor, Safeway represented 85% of
annual revenues; Mr. Parks had dropped most of his other
clients to assist Safeway in its big remodeling program in
the early '80s. After the pullout, his company nearly folded,
all but three employees were laid off, and Mr. Parks had a
heart attack and died.
   "Safeway was his whole world," says his son, Harry Jr.
"That's all he cared about for 30 years. When they pulled
out, it was like his whole family died."
   The North Texas Food Bank suffered, too. It lost a
founding member and its leading contributor; Safeway used to
donate 600,000 pounds of food a year.
   "The bottom line," food-bank director Lori Palmer says,
"is fewer people ate."
   ---
   The layoffs in Oakland, Dallas and elsewhere were just one
part of KKR's broad-based plan to cut costs, boost
profitability and meet the stiff interest and principal
deadlines set by the company's lenders and debt-holders.
About 1,000 of the company's stores were sold, as were 45
plants and other facilities.
   Safeway put whole divisions in Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas
and Utah among others on the auction block. They were sold to
a few grocery chains, many other LBO investors and, in some
cases, real-estate investors.
   The real-estate investors didn't rehire any Safeway
workers: They converted the properties to video shops, thrift
stores, and in one case a bingo parlor. Some were boarded up.
   While grocery chains bought some Safeway stores just to
shut them down and reduce competition, other chains bought
whole Safeway divisions and kept most of the workers; the
British and Oklahoma divisions are examples of this. In other
cases, new owners retained only selected workers. In
virtually all cases, though, new ownership meant pay cuts.
   In what seemed at first the best deal for employees, the
grocery chain Borman's Inc. bought the entire Safeway Utah
division and hired virtually all the workers. But nine months
later, these 3,000 employees lost their jobs when Borman sold
the division, piece by piece, to local competitors and
investors. Only a few of the stores in the Salt Lake City
area still operate as supermarkets.
   Don Schanche, a Safeway meatcutter in Salt Lake City for
25 years, spiraled downward from his $12.33 hourly pay at
Safeway to a reduced wage scale at Borman's "Farmer Jack"
outlet, to an unsuccessful appeal for any minimum-wage
employment at the same store, which had been bought by his
old manager. Now Mr. Schanche drives by a "for lease" sign in
front of the store, which is empty, having gone belly-up. Mr.
Schanche is making a living as a "job coach" in a
state-funded displaced-workers program -- where he is
currently counseling other ex-grocery store employees
following an LBO involving their employer, Alpha-Beta.
   Mr. Magowan, as Safeway's CEO but no longer the man with
final decision-making authority, was at first opposed to the
extent of the divestiture program, people familiar with the
situation say. He liked being the head of the world's largest
supermarket chain. But KKR officials gave him little choice
if he wanted to stay on board, these people say.
   Mr. Magowan himself says that "no one twisted my arm" over
the restructuring. Still, he says he "regrets" selling
promising divisions, mentioning in particular Los Angeles, El
Paso, Tulsa, and Little Rock.
   Still others point with regret to the loss of the
company's 132-store British division -- a top-performer known
in-house as the "jewel" of the Safeway collection -- and the
sale of Safeway's successful discount chain of liquor stores,
Liquor Barn, which under its new owners (Majestic Wine
Warehouses Ltd.) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
in 1988.
   Despite such regrets, however, Mr. Magowan is now a
self-professed believer in the LBO concept. For one thing,
his own performance has been rewarded under KKR, which has
increased his annual compensation by about 40% to $1.2
million including bonus. His bonus potential has climbed to
110% of base pay from 40% before the buy-out, and he has
earned the highest possible bonus every year.
   Many things have gone well for the buy-out group.The sale
of the British division alone brought $929 million, part of
the $2.4 billion that KKR got from asset sales -- or 40% more
than KKR officials say they had projected.
   Thanks to sales of some money-losing operations, Safeway's
basic business could earn more without raising prices. The
company's stores are now No. 1 or 2 in most of its markets.
By 1989, operating profit per employee was up 62% from 1985,
and operating margins had increased by nearly half. The
company is producing nearly twice as much annual cash flow as
it needs to cover yearly interest payments. As a result,
Safeway has been able to pay bank lenders ahead of schedule
and negotiate lower interest rates.
   Finally, KKR and Safeway officials also credit a new
combination of incentives and quotas that they say make
workers more entrepreneurial and at the same time more
accountable.
   Mr. Magowan says that employees are thriving in this
post-LBO culture: "I am convinced that today's typical
Safeway employee feels better about the company than he or
she has at any point since the buy-out." Store managers, he
says, "genuinely enjoy this extra responsibility" of meeting
new quotas.
   Not every part of the new Safeway picture is as rosy as
Mr. Magowan portrays it, however.
   The public offering completed recently didn't quite go as
planned. The offering's underwriters knocked the price down
to $11.25 from the $20 a share envisioned last summer. Mr.
Magowan himself concedes, "I think if we had known right at
the start that this was the price that we would've gotten, we
probably wouldn't have come out with our offering." He blames
the much-publicized problems of other leveraged companies for
unjustly tainting Safeway's offering and driving away stock
shoppers.
   But some potential investors say that it was Safeway's own
financial condition that turned them off.
   The company labors under an interest bill of about $400
million a year, a negative net worth of $389 million, and a
remaining $3.1 billion in debt. The company's net income was
only $2.5 million last year (after accounting for
nonrecurring expenses), down from $31 million the year
before. Safeway lost a whopping $488 million in 1987, the
first year of the LBO.
   A large amount of capital improvement has been postponed,
with such annual spending falling from an average $600
million to $700 million in the three years before the buy-out
to an average of $300 million in the years since. The company
estimates it must spend $3.2 billion on store remodeling and
openings over the next five years. And Safeway now has few
assets left that it can justify jettisoning.

   When Mr. Magowan in 1988 sat down with a group of
specially selected employees to tell them the story of "our
growing success," the workers had a different story to tell
him, as chronicled by the company's own magazine, Safeway
Today.
   "The morale in Richmond {Calif.} right now is down to rock
bottom," Vince Macias, a 25-year trucker, told the boss. He
added that drivers were forced to pull as much as 16-hour
shifts and were so overworked they were "dangerous" on the
highways.
   "The morale is so bad in some of our stores," Christie
Mills, a San Jose employee, told him, that it's driving away
customers.
   "There aren't many of us, and hours are cut back so much,"
said Cheryl Deniz, a bakery clerk. "I don't let the customer
see it, but inside I'm miserable. . . . I want to be happy
when I wait on them. . . . I try my best, but sometimes I'm
so overloaded. It's unfair to the customer, and it's unfair
to the employee. . . . And some of you feel the same way."
   Mr. Magowan looked around the room. "I see everybody
nodding their heads to what you are saying," he told her.
Then he added: "I've heard this before."
   (A Safeway spokesman says the company immediately followed
up on the workers' complaints and that Mr. Magowan personally
wrote letters to those employees who voiced concerns.)
   Certainly many employees have emerged unscathed from the
LBO and feel comfortable working under the new regime. A good
number of them even applaud the company for its rapid
surfacing from the debt depths.
   But among a group of workers that Safeway supplies to this
newspaper as a sampler of "happy employees," no one
interviewed is praising the LBO.
   "We've recovered well," says Jim Ratto, a Safeway liquor
merchandiser. "But personally, I think Safeway would have
been better off if we had never gone through the leveraged
buy-out. It definitely added some problems, and the company
would have been farther ahead now if it had never happened."
   "Safeway's made a beautiful comeback, we're getting on our
feet again, and I have no complaints," says George Voronin,
an affable wine steward who says "I always try to look on the
positive side." But even Mr. Voronin adds, "When someone
comes in and takes all your funds and sells your stores,
isn't that what we in the United States call dishonest?"
   The new esprit de corps trumpeted in the executive suite
is less apparent in the grocery aisles, where store employees
say the KKR-inspired quotas -- based on complex
return-on-market-value formulas -- create anxiety as well as
productivity. And the pressure mounts as one goes down the
chain from manager to checker.
   While Safeway executives call the quota program an
"incentive" plan, some store managers refer to it as "the
punishment system." That's because store managers say if they
don't make the week's quota, they can be penalized. In some
divisions they report that they must work a seven-day week as
penance. Working a month without a day off isn't unusual,
managers in the Washington and California divisions say. In
some stores managers who miss quota say they have to pull 6
a.m. to 6 p.m. shifts.
   Mr. Magowan says corporate headquarters sets no such
penalties. "I have never heard of any such program," he says.
"I simply do not believe for one second that this is any
widespread activity." A company spokesman says that at least
50% of store managers are meeting their quota.
   Even among the list of satisfied employees that Safeway
provides, many aren't profiting from the incentive plan.
Either they are too low on the totem pole to get a bonus
(with a few exceptions, only department heads and higher
qualify), or their departments aren't generating enough sales
volume to meet the demanding quotas. Mr. Voronin, whose wine
department has been on the incentive plan for two years, has
yet to get a bonus. Mary Wise is head of the floral
department, but the company hasn't yet cut her into the plan.
She says she doesn't mind: "I leave feeling good, knowing I
did the job right, and for me, that's my bonus." She adds,
"But I'm one of those people you look at and say, `Oh, why is
she always so happy?'"
   In Seattle, only one of more than a dozen store managers
in one district expects to meet quota this year, managers
say. Last year, none made more than 20% of their bonus
potential, the store heads say. A Safeway spokesman says most
managers in that region are making their quota.
   On Safeway's home turf in the San Francisco area, managers
are "stepping down" and becoming checkers. Some have been
forced to turn in their manager badges when they didn't meet
quota; others say they are voluntarily taking lower status
and pay -- out of exhaustion.
   "A number of store managers have stepped down, this year
particularly," a company spokesman acknowledges. "In recent
years, the job has gotten tougher."
   In the wake of the LBO, the company was able to squeeze
labor concessions from the unions, using the Dallas shutdown
as an object lesson of what can happen when labor costs are
deemed too high. With the debt hovering overhead, you could
"get the labor concessions you deserve," Mr. Magowan says.
   "It was like coming to the table with a gun at our heads,"
recalls Ed Hardy, a United Food and Commercial Workers
negotiator. While the company's average hourly wage rate has
risen slightly in the last three years -- the exact amount is
confidential, Safeway says -- the small increase trails the
inflation rate.
   The strategy of catering to the upscale at many stores has
also enabled KKR to cut service workers' wages even further.
To staff trendy specialty departments, Safeway has hired
"general merchandise clerks," a classification that pays as
little as half the wages of food clerks.
   This disparity troubles even the upbeat floral manager
Mary Wise. "Gosh, you can barely live on what they are paying
them," she says. She broached the subject with Mr. Magowan at
the 1988 meeting. These specialty clerks are performing a job
that requires training and skill, she said, and "Safeway
should pay them accordingly."
   Mr. Magowan's response, as quoted in the company's
magazine: "The problem, Mary, is this. The reason we got the
lower GMC {general merchandising clerk} rate was to allow our
labor costs to be competitive." But he reassured her that the
company was taking steps to make up for the low pay. "What
I've suggested from time to time is saying, `Do you like
weekends off? Do you like to work 8 to 5?' . . . We'll give
you the lower rate but a better schedule.' That might make
them very happy."
   ---
   In one division, Safeway has extended the incentive
program beyond the department manager level in an experiment
aimed at letting all workers benefit in the enhanced
productivity they are generating. Employees in the Denver
division took a 14% pay cut, but were assured that, on
average, the new profit-sharing plan would more than make up
the difference. The company acknowledges this hasn't happened
in nearly half the cases; the union estimates that even fewer
increased their earnings.
   Store employees in Denver also complained about the way
the incentive system was linked -- as it is throughout the
company -- to grievances and work-related medical claims.
"Managers have been saying to people, don't file workman's
comp because it will hurt the bonus," says Charles Mercer,
president of the Denver local of the United Food and
Commercial Workers. Mr. Magowan concedes that the Denver
bonus plan is "not very popular."
   Mr. Magowan's assertion that Safeway's culture is more
collegial now also doesn't always square with the view from
the retail floor. In stores around the country, employees
report that management is pushing out older, skilled and
well-paid employees, turning to cheap part-time help (who
don't get medical insurance and other benefits) and piling
extra work on the remaining staff. Union officials estimate
that the average age of the stores' work force has dropped 10
years since the buy-out; a company spokesman disputes this,
but says Safeway doesn't track age.
   "Safeway used to be one of the best places to work of the
retail grocers," says Rowena Schoos, a middle-aged Safeway
meatcutter in Oregon for five years. "But after the buy-out,
they started cutting hours to the nitty-gritty, the store
managers went into mass panic, and Safeway just turned into a
burnout company."
   Ms. Schoos recently left herself, after she was cut back
to 16 hours a week and lost her medical benefits. Like many
of the older and well-paid meatcutters, she says, she was
relegated to the "extra board," a tour of duty that can
require driving more than 100 miles a day to different stores
to fill in where needed.
   For the older butchers, many of whom suffer physical
injuries from the years of toting and carving, the assignment
is the final shove out the door. Ms. Schoos, for example, has
two herniated discs, which she attributes to years of lugging
100-pound carcasses.
   A Safeway spokesman responds, "That's just another case of
an isolated situation. She was just not performing the job
adequately," and thus her hours were cut.
   The company also says that meatcutters' numbers have been
reduced primarily because a gradual shift to pre-packaged
goods in meat processing has lessened the need. Employees in
the meat department argue that even with the changes, much of
the work still requires a butcher's expertise and that the
cutbacks have been too severe.
   While on the extra-board circuit, Ms. Schoos had the
opportunity to observe the LBO-fallout at many stores. "It
was the same thing everywhere I went," she recalls. "The
managers were desperate to meet quota and the older people
always got it the worst. They'd bust them back to lower
positions. One produce manager was told he had a `choice' --
go back to being a checker or get fired. One lady asked for a
break, and the manager cut her from 40 to eight hours."
   In response, Mr. Magowan produces a recent employee survey
conducted in the Portland, Ore., division that finds that
more than 80% of employees feel Safeway offers advancement
opportunity and other advantages. "These would be good scores
to decertify the union should we ever wish to do so," Mr.
Magowan says, adding, "which we have no intention of doing,
whatsoever."
   Closer to headquarters, at the Market Street store in San
Francisco, employees report a grind of tension and overwork.
Some say they are shouldering as many as nine different jobs.
In the meat department, the butchers' numbers have been cut
back sharply and inexperienced clerks take up the slack.
"Everyone is burned out," says another employee, who points
to a counter where overripe meat is on display, the result of
a hasty stocking effort. "It's a whole new ballgame and
everyone's discontented."
   In the Market Street store, employees complain that
clipboard-toting managers patrol the floors, closely
monitoring performance and filing a blizzard of disciplinary
reports. A company spokesman disputes these accounts: "There
is no ROMV {Return on Market Value} police."
   Last month, at the Market Street store, food clerk Steve
Dolinka lost his job after 25 years of service. His
malfeasance: He says he forgot to pay for the cup of soup and
toast he ate at the deli on his lunch hour. Mr. Dolinka
apologized, shelled out the few dollars that his food cost,
and explained why he was so distracted -- his mind was on a
murder trial that had ended a few weeks earlier. A
gas-station robber was before the court charged with slitting
the throat of Mr. Dolinka's 15-year-old son in 1982 in an
assault that the investigating detective called "the most
brutal in my experience."
   "My wife says I've been forgetting things a lot lately,"
Mr. Dolinka says.
   "In our business, employee theft is a serious problem," a
company spokesman says of Mr. Dolinka's expulsion. "And every
employee is treated the same way."
   Mr. Dolinka says he doesn't blame his manager for the
firing. "The way it works here, I don't think any of the
managers have the freedom to make these decisions. It's all
coming down from company policy, and they have got to follow
it like their bible."
   To all such reports from the store front, Mr. Magowan says
he's skeptical: "Our productivity is up," he points out.
Employees are donating more to Easter Seals, and workers'
compensation claims are down, he says. And when the
earthquake hit, "our employees stayed up all night cleaning
up their stores."
   "Are these acts of a disgruntled work force?" he asks. "I
don't think so."
   George Roberts, one of KKR's two principal partners, notes
that workers at many corporations are being asked to do more,
whether an LBO is involved or not. Employees "are now being
held accountable," Mr. Roberts says. "They have to produce up
to plan, if they are going to be competitive with the rest of
the world. It's high time we did that."
