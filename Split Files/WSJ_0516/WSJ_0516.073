   NEW YORK -- Frederic Seegal, head of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.'s investment-banking group for media companies,
jumped ship to become co-head of Salomon Inc.'s corporate
finance operations.
   The move, considered a coup for Salomon, is a sign of that
firm's determination to build its presence in investment
banking for the media industry. And analysts said it
underscores the problems Shearson faces in retaining key
talent amid its much-publicized financial and management
troubles.

   Mr. Seegal, a 16-year veteran at Shearson, will become a
managing director at Salomon. Mr. Seegal, 41 years old, will
work with Denis A. Bovin, co-head of corporate finance, and
report to Salomon Vice Chairmen Jay F. Higgins and Leo I.
Higdon Jr.
   Salomon has been seeking to position its
investment-banking operation in several areas -- including
media, energy and industrial companies -- that it has
identified as having long-term profit potential. For example,
Salomon represented GTE Corp. in its recently announced $710
million purchase of the Providence Journal's ownership
interest in cellular franchises in four states.
   For Shearson, the loss of Mr. Seegal may be blunted
somewhat by the slowdown in transactions among media
companies. But Mr. Seegal and Salomon nevertheless expect the
media business, which in their broad definition includes
telephone, cellular and entertainment companies, to heat up
again.
   "If there's ever been an industry populated with
aggressive people who want to do deals, it's the media
business," Mr. Seegal said yesterday.
   Shearson hasn't yet named a successor to Mr. Seegal, who
joined the firm as an associate in 1974 from Harvard
University, where he studied law and business. In 1981, Mr.
Seegal was named managing director at Lehman Brothers Kuhn
Loeb Inc., a predecessor firm, and he also was named head of
the firm's media and communications team.
   Shearson's media group has 11 professionals, including
three analysts. The No. 2 professional in Shearson's media
group, senior vice president Jill Greenthal, recently moved
to the firm's London office, reflecting the increasingly
international bent of media banking.
   While Mr. Seegal's departure suggests that Shearson is
having trouble keeping some of its senior professionals,
Shearson officials privately say they believe the firm has
done a good job at keeping most of its top people. And Mr.
Seegal said his move was no reflection on Shearson.
   "This shouldn't be viewed as a vote of no confidence at
Shearson; it was just a great opportunity," Mr. Seegal said.
"If (Salomon) had called a year and a half ago, I'd have
taken it."
   Indeed, Mr. Seegal will have far greater responsibilities
at Salomon than he ever had at Shearson. Along with Mr.
Bovin, he will oversee Salomon's coverage of corporate
clients in most of the U.S., Canada and Latin America.
   Salomon, for its part, is expected to add to its corporate
finance area, which currently has a staff of about 150. The
firm has about a dozen professionals in its media group.
