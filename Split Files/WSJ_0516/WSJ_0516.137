   Bass PLC, a major British brewing company, said it
completed the sale of its Crest Hotel chain to Trusthouse
Forte PLC, a U.K. hotels group.
   Bass said Trusthouse Forte will pay #300 million ($504.5
million) in cash, lifting the total proceeds from Bass's
hotel sales thus far this year to #400 million.

   Bass said the sale is the "most significant step" so far
in its continuing program of disposing hotel properties that
no longer fit into its long-term strategy of focusing on the
development of its Holiday Inn brand world-wide.
   Last August, Bass bought the Holiday Inn hoteliers in the
U.S. for $1.98 billion. It has also held a number of Holiday
Inn franchises in the U.S. since acquiring Holiday Corp.'s
operations outside North America in 1988.
   The transaction with Trusthouse Forte will involve the
sale of 43 hotels, while Bass will retain four hotels in the
U.K. and four in continental Europe.
   Trusthouse Forte's chief executive, Rocco Forte, said the
deal was an "excellent purchase," which is expected to make a
positive contribution to profits in the current financial
year. "The Crest Hotels we are buying are in very good
condition and are well managed," he added.
