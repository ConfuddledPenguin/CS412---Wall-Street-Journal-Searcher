   NEW YORK -- News Corp. posted a net loss of $24 million on
slim revenue growth for the fiscal third quarter, hurt by
high interest payments, unfavorable currency translations,
and continuing losses at its Britain-based Sky Television
venture.
   Booming results at News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co.
network and the Fox TV stations in the U.S. weren't enough to
offset losses at Sky, or the high costs of the company's
strike-wracked Australian airline and foreign-currency
translations. The currency impact triggered the net loss for
the quarter ended March 31, but even without it the company's
"income before abnormal items" plunged 82% from a year
earlier.

   Rupert Murdoch, News Corp.'s chairman, recently said he
will now shun major acquisitions, avoid new debt and focus on
growth from within. His No. 1 pursuit is Sky Television, the
four-channel satellite service that has registered losses of
$144.8 million since Sept. 1, including a $50 million loss in
the fiscal third quarter. Mr. Murdoch has said he expects Sky
to run losses of another #100 million ($168.3 million) before
it can break even in late 1991.
   For the quarter ended March 31, News Corp. posted a net
loss of $24 million, or nine cents an American depository
receipt, compared with net income of $27.4 million, or 23
cents an ADR, a year earlier. Revenue rose slightly to $1.68
billion from $1.62 billion.
   Wall Street reacted mildly to the report, with News
Corp.'s American depository receipts closing at $15.375, down
62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   News Corp. said sales were strong in most major markets.
Newspaper profits rose in Australia and in the Pacific Basin
and "held steady" in Britain, "despite worsening advertising
conditions in all markets," the company said, adding that
News Corp.'s overall profit would have exceeded record levels
of a year earlier without the losses at Sky Television and at
Ansett, its Australian airline.
   Despite the net loss, News Corp.'s operating profit was
"still better than I expected," said Jessica Reif, an analyst
at First Boston Corp. The company posted $8.3 million in
pretax earnings before currency charges, down sharply from
$45.3 million a year earlier, but still 10% higher than she
had predicted. The foreign-currency charge of $32.3 million,
taken in the quarter because News Corp. took out loans in
U.S. dollars and is paying them back in weaker Australian
dollars, is merely an accounting measure that doesn't drain
cash in the bank, she said.
   The First Boston analyst expects losses at Sky Television
to narrow in the current quarter as the service charges
subscribers for movies. Ms. Reif also believes the Fox
network can post pretax profit of $30 million for the fiscal
year ending June 30 -- its first profitable year -- and can
double those earnings in fiscal 1991. "Potentially, Fox next
year could be more profitable than CBS," Ms. Reif said.
   For the nine months, News Corp.'s net income fell 76% to
$93 million, or 74 cents per ADR, from $384.8 million, or
$2.41 an ADR, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $4.82 billion
from $4.53 billion in the year-earlier period, which included
$127.7 million after taxes in one-time gains, largely from
the sale of Elle magazine.
