   Corn futures prices dropped on widespread selling by
commodity fund managers and unfounded rumors about rapidly
worsening political upheaval in the Soviet Union, a major
importer of U.S. grain.
   Rumors swept the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade
yesterday morning that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had
either been assassinated or that political opposition to his
leadership had sharply increased. No news emerged to support
the rumors. In fact, the White House announced yesterday
afternoon that President Gorbachev planned to extend by two
days until June 4 his U.S. summit meeting with President Bush
that is scheduled to begin May 30.

   What's more, the government announced another
150,000-metric-ton sale of corn to the Soviets, following a
similarly sized corn sale to the Soviets reported Monday. The
Soviets are within about one million metric tons of the 17
million to 18 million metric tons of corn they are expected
to purchase this season. Despite continued reports that the
Soviets are delaying payments for imports and scrambling to
finance international trade, the Soviets are likely to make a
good-will gesture in the form of additional corn purchases
ahead of the summit, analysts said.
   Trend-following commodity funds started selling corn
futures contracts as the price declined, which put further
pressure on futures prices.
   Corn futures for July delivery declined six cents a bushel
to close at $2.8475 on the Board of Trade.
   Continued wet weather in the Midwest and a 30-day forecast
calling for cool, wet weather across much of the Corn Belt
also depressed corn prices by greatly increasing the odds
against a drought-reduced harvest this year.
   "Rain makes grain," one analyst said.
   The sell-off in the corn futures trading pit at the Board
of Trade weighed on soybean futures prices as well.
Commodity-fund managers actively sold soybean futures
contracts, helping to drive July soybean futures down 10.75
cents a bushel to close at $6.25.
   Adding to the weakness in soybean futures prices was the
continued lack of substantial export demand, said Daniel
Basse, director of marketing for AgResource Co., Chicago.
   Wheat futures prices held up the best under the wave of
sell orders on the Board of Trade floor. Even as corn futures
traders were anticipating the imminent demise of President
Gorbachev, wheat futures traders were spreading rumors that
the Soviet Union would shortly receive export bonuses to buy
one million to two million metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   July wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 0.75
cents to close at $3.4375 a bushel.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Rising visible supplies of copper continued to
exert pressure on futures prices. The May contract caught the
brunt of the reaction, declining 2.70 cents a pound to
$1.2130, while July eased only 0.90 cent to $1.1410. A
similar narrowing of the premium of the spot contract over
the forward position occurred in the London market, an
analyst said. At least in part, this was traced to an
increase of 5,650 tons to 67,000 tons in copper inventories
in London Metal Exchange warehouses. While the increase was
within industry expectations, it still meant more metal was
immediately available, the analyst said. Supplies also rose
again in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses, increasing
yesterday by 428 tons, to 6,335 tons. U.S. sales of
automobiles in the first 10 days of May were sharply lower
than a year earlier, dropping by as much as 23% for Chrysler
Corp., the analyst noted. Also, he said, a decline in U.S.
industrial production and a slight easing in plant-capacity
utilization indicate a slowing of the economy and a possible
consequent decline in industrial copper use. In Peru, the
strike that began Monday at the state-owned Centromin Co.
mines continued, but these mines are mostly zinc and lead
producers and have only a small copper output. A New York
spokesman for the company said the union representing workers
at the company's Toquepala mine had given the concern notice
that those workers would strike, but didn't cite any date or
duration of the strike. The spokesman said Southern Peru
Copper Corp. is negotiating individually with unions
representing workers at its Cuajone and Toquepala mines and
at the Ilo smelter.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum futures were mixed on some profit-taking
after Monday's rally. The New York Mercantile Exchange's
crude oil contract for June delivery declined 12 cents a
barrel to $19.59. Heating oil also fell 0.71 cent a gallon to
51.72 cents. But unleaded gasoline futures firmed on news of
problems at two West Coast refineries. June-delivery gasoline
was up 0.54 cent a gallon to 63.51 cents. Some traders
remained on the sidelines to wait for the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report on U.S. oil statistics, released as
usual after trading had closed. It had been expected to show
lower inventories of gasoline and crude oil. There was a big
decline, nearly 4.2 million barrels, last week in gasoline
inventories. But crude oil in storage rose by more than 4.3
million barrels. Analysts differ over the impact on today's
trading. But Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp. said that
"the API gasoline number is more bullish than the crude
number is bearish."
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed. June delivery
gold rose $2.40 an ounce to $372.30. July silver was off 5.5
cents an ounce at $5.07. July platinum edged higher by 70
cents an ounce to $487.90. The most notable feature of the
day's trading, one analyst said, was the ability of gold to
recover from early weakness and close strong, particularly in
the face of a stronger dollar, a factor that usually incurs
weakness in gold. The rebound was attributed to a revival of
investor demand for gold bullion in Europe, he said. He noted
that when the June price has dropped to around $367 an ounce,
it has spurred buying of bullion. Platinum rose in sympathy
with gold and was also helped by Japanese buying interest for
platinum bullion, he said. Another analyst, Bernard Savaiko
of PaineWebber, noted that the metals market was rife with
speculation about the Soviet Union and its purchases of U.S.
grains, which were financed with sales of gold and platinum.
Essentially, the rumors were that the Soviet Union was having
financial troubles and, as a result, had cut off purchases of
grains and had ceased selling gold and platinum. "My own
belief is that the Soviet Union has already bought the bulk
of the grains it needs for the time being, and will be a less
aggressive marketer of gold and platinum in the foreseeable
future," Mr. Savaiko said. If June gold rises above $374,
which was yesterday's intraday high and around which the
Soviets lately have sold gold, that would seem to confirm the
belief that the Soviets have temporarily suspended sales, he
said.
