   Borden Inc. said it acquired a Canadian pasta and pasta
sauce business from Campbell Soup Co. and a South Carolina
producer of foils and papers for laminates.
   The Gattuso pasta business has estimated annual sales of
$14 million; it will become part of Borden's Catelli unit in
Montreal.

   New York-based Borden also acquired Letron Inc., a maker
of foils, with estimated 1990 sales of $20 million. That
business complements Borden's Orchard Decorative Products
unit, which supplies decorative printed overlays for
wallcoverings, furniture, floor tiles and other applications.
   Borden, with annual sales of $7.6 billion in 1989,
produces foods, non-food consumer products, packaging and
industrial products.
