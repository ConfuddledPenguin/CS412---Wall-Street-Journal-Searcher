   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The Bonn government and the 11
West German states plan a 115-billion-mark ($70.02 billion)
special German Unity Fund financed by credits to help pay for
the reconstruction of East Germany's economy through 1994.
   Creation of the financing vehicle for German reunification
depended on the willingness of hesitant state governments to
commit to a 50% share of the fund. In a meeting with Finance
Minister Theo Waigel last night, the state finance ministers
agreed to the huge fund, an individual in the ministry said.

   The plan requires approval of the 11 state governors. The
Bonn cabinet would then decide on the facility during a
special Friday session.
   The size of the unity fund was the first clear estimate of
the monumental cost West Germans face in absorbing East
Germany's collapsing economy. Officials in Bonn noted,
however, that the estimate is based on sparse knowledge of
the depth of East Germany's woes.
   The Finance Ministry said earlier yesterday that the
German Unity Fund would be built up by debt issued in the
domestic capital market and would be considered a special
facility maintained separately from Bonn's federal budget.
The interest and principal would be serviced by the federal
and state governments, but the form of borrowing hasn't been
decided.
   Net borrowing under the fund would total 95 billion marks,
officials said.
   The Finance Ministry denied reports it is planning to form
the fund through special bonds designed for international
investors, particularly the Japanese.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl told reporters in
Basel, Switzerland, after a meeting of European Community
central bankers that an issue of international bonds "is not
the appropriate way to finance German unification."
   With the plan to merge the German monetary and economic
systems set for July 2, Bonn officials still are guessing at
the total funding requirements in the absence of reliable
figures on the extent of East Germany's economic crisis.
   Among other variables, the costs of protecting East German
property and farms have yet to be determined. Future East
German unemployment also could cause broad swings in support
costs. Figures released yesterday showed joblessness has
tripled to 100,000 from 26,600 in March, and many economists
estimate the rate will surge to as high as two million by the
end of next year as the nation's once-protected industry
adjusts to free markets.
   West German officials estimated East Germany's budget
deficit would total 30 billion marks in the second half of
this year and about 50 billion marks in 1991, after which the
costs gradually should taper off.
   Market analysts anticipate a sharp jump in Bonn's
borrowing requirements amid projections an all-German federal
budget deficit in the wake of economic union could exceed 100
billion marks in 1991, possibly depressing bond prices and
driving up interest rates. In coming years, the analysts
suggested the fund could be serviced from higher tax revenues
for expected economic growth in the united German economy.
   The ministry is confident the capital market can absorb
the additional funding requirement, noting that West Germany
last year had a net overall savings volume of 280 billion
marks, as well as capital exports of 120 billion marks.
   "The capital requirement for financing German unity can be
covered by the domestic market," it concluded. In addition,
West Germany's liberal capital market allows foreigners
access to domestic debt instruments, the ministry said.
   One German government official said, "There would be
several ways to finance this fund, it doesn't necessarily
have to be a conventional bond issue." One alternative would
be for the government to issue non-tradable notes through the
banking system.
   In addition to the unity fund, Bonn should be able to drum
up financing by phasing out programs associated with a
divided Germany. Put at nearly 40 billion marks, these
include subsidies to West Berlin and West German border
regions, as well as former currency-exchange pacts with East
Germany.
