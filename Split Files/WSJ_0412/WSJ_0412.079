   NEW YORK -- After a 1980s buying binge that built News
Corp. into a global giant but saddled it with more than $6
billion in debt, Rupert Murdoch says it's time for his
company to forgo major acquisitions, prop up plunging
earnings and focus on its current stable of entertainment and
media businesses.
   But Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer of
the Australia-based media company, denies that he is under
any pressure to make major asset sales. Instead, he says, he
will sell some properties on a selective basis, and may take
on partners in some businesses such as movie production to
raise cash. He aims to focus his personal attention on Sky
Television, the nascent British satellite-TV service that he
says has accumulated operating losses of more than #250
million ($411 million); he expects it to have losses of #100
million more before reaching break-even in late 1991.

   In the meantime, Mr. Murdoch vows to make no major
acquisitions for the next two to three years. That marks a
big retrenchment for the acquisitive media magnate, who piled
up debt to acquire the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio and
Metromedia TV stations, build the Fox TV network, and buy
publishing properties such as Harper &amp; Row and TV Guide.
Right now, he says, nothing whets his appetite.
   "We're going to grow organically," Mr. Murdoch says in an
interview. "We've got to restore and {increase} our profits
before we can look at any major purchases."
   Rebuilding profits will take some doing, particularly with
a heavy debt burden. Largely because of losses associated
with Sky Television, operating profits will probably plunge
40% to 50% in the fiscal year ending June 30, Mr. Murdoch
concedes.
   But he remains fiercely optimistic about Sky's chances for
success. The four-channel service has a one-year head start
on rival British Satellite Broadcasting Corp., and Mr.
Murdoch says it has over one million viewers in the U.K. --
450,000 of those paying subscribers to the scrambled movie
portion of the service. By the second half of next year, he
predicts, it will have two million paying subscribers; Sky is
installing new equipment in homes at a rate of 20,000 a week,
according to Mr. Murdoch. Longer term, he is optimistic as
well about News Corp.'s partnership in an ambitious venture
in the U.S., Sky Cable, which aims to deliver 108 channels of
programming directly to homes here.
   Still, for an executive who has rarely suffered setbacks,
Mr. Murdoch's wings have been clipped, particularly by the
failure of his plan to create a second company he referred to
as "Son of News Corp." Last year, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp. tried to raise $1 billion for the new company in a
private placement; News Corp. planned to transfer its book
publishing assets to the new company, thereby lowering News
Corp.'s debt and giving it a vehicle to build yet another
media giant.
   "We failed to make the thing fly," says Mr. Murdoch, who
notes that Credit Suisse was able to line up only half the
funding he sought. As a result, News Corp.'s debt will
actually increase later this year because it has to take its
Harper &amp; Collins book publishing operations back onto its
balance sheet; after News Corp. sells $500 million to $600
million of book publishing assets, total News Corp. debt will
rise to $6.5 billion from $6.1 billion now.
   Investors are encouraged by some of Mr. Murdoch's recent
moves, such as his decision to sell the tabloid magazine the
Star to G.P. Group Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer,
for $400 million in cash and preferred stock. "I don't think
shareholders are looking for distress sales, but selling the
Star was a good move," says Karen Firestone, a money manager
at Fidelity Management &amp; Research Corp. in Boston. "News
Corp. has placed its bets in a few key businesses such as
film production, broadcasting, satellite distribution, and
newspaper publishing, and businesses that are extraneous
should be divested where appropriate."
   John Reidy, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., agrees. "I think this is a time for a complete
reappraisal of the portfolio," he says. "The only thing
that's surprising is that there haven't been more
transactions." Mr. Reidy blames uncertainty over the extent
of losses at Sky TV and concern about debt for the poor
performance of News Corp.'s stock; the company's American
depositary receipts have been trading near their 52-week low
recently.
   But Ms. Firestone and Mr. Reidy agree that News Corp. is
still uniquely positioned to grow internally. "Murdoch has
been able to start numerous businesses such as the Fox
network from scratch, and do some things no one ever expected
he could," says Ms. Firestone. "If he just works on what he's
got without starting another venture somewhere, maybe the
market will begin to respond."
   Indeed, there's plenty to work on internally. Mr.
Murdoch's forecast that Sky will be profitable within two to
three years could turn out to be optimistic if new rivals
such as British Satellite Broadcasting fare better than Mr.
Murdoch expects. A tough economy in the U.K. may hurt his
newspaper business, where he has continued to invest heavily
in modernization and expansion. The U.S. advertising climate
remains difficult for News Corp.'s magazines, and analysts
say some may be prime candidates for sale.
   While Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller has focused on
building the Fox TV network, the Fox movie studio has been
among the industry's poorest performers at the box office.
Last year, Fox released 17 movies but had only 6.3% of the
box office, ranking it seventh among the eight major studios.
Last summer, Joe Roth, an established independent producer,
was brought in to head the studio, and he has put more than
25 movies into production. "I'm confident now that we've got
a terrific guy running it," says Mr. Murdoch. As reported,
News Corp. is also in talks with Japanese investors who may
provide cash to start a "satellite" movie-production company
under the Fox banner, he says.
   The Fox network, meanwhile, is expected to post its first
profit for the full fiscal year. Fox Broadcasting Co., the
network entity, may post pretax operating profit of $38
million for the year ending June 30, after losses of $2
million a year ago and $100 million two years ago, Mr.
Murdoch says.
   The network's improving ratings -- its huge cartoon hit
"The Simpsons" is the nation's No. 1 show among 12 to 24 year
olds -- have helped Fox's group of seven TV stations. Fox
Television Stations Inc. will post pre-tax earnings of
perhaps $140 million before paying interest on $1.45 billion
that News Corp. borrowed to buy the stations; profits will be
about $20 million after interest, Mr. Murdoch estimates.
   Fox now airs programs three nights a week and plans to add
other nights, children's cartoons and a national newscast.
But first, federal regulators must agree with Fox's request
that it be exempted from regulations blocking the Big Three
networks from the rerun business, a lucrative source of
revenue for Fox.
   Mr. Murdoch says the Fox network and the studio will
eventually be important suppliers of programming for News
Corp.'s direct-broadcast satellite ventures, both in the U.S.
and in Britain. Fox, for example, already has plans on the
drawing board for another program network that could be
delivered via satellite or cable in the U.S.
   For the time being, analysts say, Mr. Murdoch must focus
his efforts on stemming the losses at Sky TV -- and girding
for competition from British Satellite Broadcasting. Mr.
Murdoch says Sky Television takes in net subscriber revenue
of only #700,000 a week but hopes it can grow to #1.7 million
a week by year end. Mr. Murdoch insists that the venture can
turn profits of #100 million a year by 1993.
   For now, Sky TV in the U.K. "remains our absolute No. 1
priority," Mr. Murdoch says. "That has taken a lot of money
and attention, and we have to see that through."
