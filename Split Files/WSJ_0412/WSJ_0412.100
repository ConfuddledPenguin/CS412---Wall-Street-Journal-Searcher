   Many of the intellectuals in the West who remain attracted
to socialism should consider the views of voters who have
lived under such regimes. Those voices could be heard this
past weekend in places as diverse as Greece, Peru, Hungary
and the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia.
   In Greece, Constantine Mitsotakis's Conservative Party has
ended the decade-old stranglehold on Greece by Andreas
Papandreou and his socialist PASOK party. Greece now has a
ruined economy, an annual inflation rate approaching 18%,
poisoned relations with NATO allies and growing urban
terrorism. Mr. Mitsotakis's pledge to curb government
spending and create a business climate that will attract
foreign investment appealed to voters, as did his explicit
commitment to retain U.S. military bases in Greece.

   Greece's problems appear small alongside Peru's, whose
hyperinflation was last clocked in excess of 2,000%.
Left-wing guerrilla violence has taken a toll of 17,000 lives
over the past decade. Voters in Sunday's presidential
election defied the Shining Path bombs, and opted for two
free-marketers, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa and
Japanese-Peruvian Alberto Fujimori. Privatization, tax reform
and slashed government spending were planks in the Vargas
Llosa platform. But Mr. Fujimori adroitly exploited some poor
economic advice Mr. Vargas Llosa followed.
   Mr. Vargas Llosa's call for a Brazilian-style austerity
program ignored the supply-side lessons of the 1980s. In a
country where one out of three persons lives hand-to-mouth,
belt-tightening sounds cruelly absurd. The approach of the
agronomist Mr. Fujimori, emphasizing a business climate
hospitable to foreign investment, makes him a formidable
candidate for the June runoff election.
   In Hungary practically nothing remains of the left after
the second round of parliamentary elections. Historian Jozsef
Antall's center-right Democratic Forum with its alliance took
57% of the vote. The rival Free Democrats and Young Democrats
made a political miscalculation by adopting a center-left
label, though their platforms have been more aggressively
free market than those of the conservatives. Parties in
Romania, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria preparing for elections
may want to keep in mind the peril of even the most subtle
hint of statist leanings.
   Slovenia also fits the trend. Voters gave the Communist
Party the backs of their hands in the races for the
republic's parliament, holding the Communist share to 17%,
against 56% for the opposition coalition. This election is
another sign that Yugoslavia's uneasy federation of
ethnically distinct states is beginning to come apart.
   Defeat at the polls seldom is accepted gracefully by the
left, whose ideology tends to be streaked with messianic
confidence. The indicted Mr. Papandreou is making threatening
noises. The Shining Path still threatens to blow apart,
literally, Peruvian democracy. Hungarians are not sure
they've escaped the grip of Communist Russia. Belgrade has
filed criminal charges against Yugoslav opposition leader
Joze Pucnik for "insulting" the army in the campaign.
   But now that voters in all these places have had a say,
maybe at least the world's socialists who operate from
countries free of socialism's depredations will pause for
reflection.
