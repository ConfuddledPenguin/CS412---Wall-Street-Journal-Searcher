   While the freeing by the pro-Libyan Fatah Revolutionary
Council of a Frenchwoman, her Belgian companion and their
child born in captivity is welcome news, it has no bearing on
the fate of the 17 American and European hostages held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   In Iran, following promising media reports earlier this
year of an imminent release of one or more American hostages,
a stalemate continues between pro- and anti-release
politicians. However, the balance of forces may now be
shifting toward the moderates, which holds the possibility of
the release of an American hostage in the next few weeks.

   On one side is pragmatic President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani. On the other, hardliner Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a
former Interior Minister and now a powerful member of the
Iranian Parliament.
   The raison d'etre for abducting Westerners in Lebanon
disappeared when the war between Iran and Iraq ended in
August 1988. The pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had used this
tactic to inhibit the U.S. from mounting direct attacks on
Iranian targets during the Gulf War. The price of any such
action would have been the execution of one or more of the
American and British captives (particularly Terry Waite, a
Briton who had received much publicity trying to secure the
release of American hostages). That this was a real threat
became clear when, following the American raid on the Libyan
capital in April 1986 by U.S. warplanes based in Britain, two
British hostages were reportedly "bought" by the Libyan
leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, and executed.
   Mr. Rafsanjani rightly considers the resolution of the
hostage crisis as the essential first step toward normalizing
relations with major Western nations, particularly the U.S.,
in order to improve the beleaguered Iranian economy. To
strengthen his case, Mr. Rafsanjani approached Sheik Muhammad
Hussein Fadlallah, the leading ideologue of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, to endorse his stance. He did
so by publicly urging the unconditional release of Western
hostages.
   Encouraged by this, Ali Muhammad Besharati, Iran's deputy
foreign minister, told the pro-Rafsanjani Tehran Times on
March 18 that all Western hostages held in Lebanon could be
free by next January, and that such a development would be
gradual.
   But Mr. Mohtashemi continues to oppose the move. At his
behest a majority of parliamentary deputies urged the
government, on March 20, to refrain from negotiating to gain
freedom for the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Moreover, Mr. Mohtashemi has as much influence, if not
more, over the Lebanese captors as does Sheik Fadlallah. As
the Iranian ambassador in Damascus, Syria, in the mid-1980s,
Mr. Mohtashemi was instrumental in establishing militant
Shiite groups in Lebanon, which among other things resorted
to abducting Westerners.
   Mr. Mohtashemi argues that once the Western powers have
recovered all their hostages, they will wreak bloody
vengeance on those responsible for their incarceration, and
the latter will have nothing to retaliate with.
   But a hostage release need not lead to violent
retaliation. One way in which the abductors can protect
themselves is by agreeing to release their captives in ones
and twos over a period of many months. This would allow the
Western governments and their citizens to dissipate their
accumulated frustration and anger gradually, and slide into
the mood of "Let bygones be bygones."
   Also, of the five groups involved in hostage-taking, a
couple are amenable to pressures from Mr. Rafsanjani. As for
the recalcitrant ones, they can be brought into line with the
threat of terminating the subsidies they receive from Tehran.
   On balance, therefore, the release of an American hostage
during the next few weeks is not unlikely, particularly when
the Tehran Times yesterday called for the unconditional
release of the hostages. This will be a useful trial balloon
for all the concerned parties.
   The crucial element in this long-running saga is the quiet
persistence with which Mr. Rafsanjani has pursued this matter
since assuming presidential office last August. He sees the
resolution of the hostage issue as an integral part of his
strategy to repair Iran's faltering economy.
   With inflation at 60% and unemployment at 25%, the Iranian
economy is in a deplorable state. According to official
sources, based on the fixed prices of 1974, per-capita income
was halved between 1978 and 1988. Part of the reason for this
decline lies with the population growth rate of 3.4%, one of
the highest in the world.
   "While Ayatollah Khomeini was alive and the war was on,
the regime constantly urged the faithful to fight for Islam,
and think of the `hereafter,'" said Irfan Parvez, executive
editor of the Tehran Times. "But now Rasfanjani wants to
stress the `here.' And he knows that to repair the economy we
need assistance from abroad."
   Mr. Rafsanjani knows too that there is no longer the
charismatic figure of Ayatollah Khomeini to inspire the
masses to suffer economic deprivation in the name of the
sacred cause of Islam and Islamic revolution. He therefore
has no choice but to tackle the economic crisis.
   He is making headway. After many months of skillful
lobbying he finally managed to secure parliamentary approval
for the $433 billion Five Year Plan for 1989-93. It assumes
foreign loans of $27 billion. This is a comparatively modest
share of the plan, and shows that Mr. Rafsanjani took into
account the opposition that radical parliamentarians maintain
toward foreign credits. They fear that economic dependence on
outside powers would undermine Iran's political independence,
which is widely regarded as the Islamic revolution's major
attainment.
   In the domestic economy, the radicals favor a strong
public sector. They also want to provide incentives to local
capital to invest in manufacturing rather than in trade.
Aware of this, the Rafsanjani administration recently offered
publicly owned mines for sale to the private sector. So far
the response has been poor, mainly because the prospective
private buyers are unsure that they would have adequate
access to electric power and foreign exchange for buying
machinery and spare parts for the mines.
   The ease with which hard currencies can be obtained by
Iranians depends on how well-disposed Western governments and
financial institutions are toward Iran. They, in turn, are
monitoring the progress of the Rafsanjani camp in
consolidating its hold over the political and economic
institutions of the state.
   Nothing would signal the advance of the Rafsanjani camp
more convincingly to Western capitals than its success in
securing the release of Western hostages in Lebanon --
gradually or precipitately.
