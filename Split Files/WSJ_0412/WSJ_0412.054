   Doctors at a for-profit health clinic chain sharply
increased the number of patient laboratory and X-ray
examinations when they were offered bonuses to increase their
clinics' revenues, according to a new study.
   The finding isn't surprising, but it adds a new dimension
to the controversy over the role of money in medicine. While
many businesses use bonuses to increase sales, some health
care experts worry that such incentives can cloud a doctor's
judgment in prescribing care for patients.

   "It's one piece of information about financial incentives
and physician behavior," says David Hemenway of the Harvard
School of Public Health and lead author of the study. "It
says that money matters. It doesn't say money is the only
thing that matters or even the most important thing."
   The report is based on the experience of 15 doctors at
different clinics owned by Health Stop Medical Management
Inc., a chain of walk-in primary care centers based in Newton
Centre, Mass., that voluntarily participated in the study.
It's especially interesting because it compares the practice
patterns of the same doctors before and after Health Stop
instituted a bonus program in mid-1985. While dozens of
studies have examined the impact of incentives on doctors --
with mixed conclusions -- very few have compared the same
doctors, working at the same facilities.
   Prior to the bonus program, Health Stop doctors were paid
at a flat rate of $28 an hour. Under the bonus program, they
were paid from $28 to $32 an hour or a percentage of the
gross monthly charges they generated, whichever was higher.
Doctors were ranked monthly based on the average charge per
patient visit and the number of diagnostic tests performed.
The reports circulated among the doctors and managers
questioned those whose results were considered outside normal
ranges.
   Researchers found that doctors ordered 23% more lab tests
per patient visit and 16% more X-rays during a three-month
period after the incentive program was established, compared
with the like period a year earlier, when the flat-rate
salary was in effect. Patient visits increased 12%. The
average charge per visit, in constant 1984 dollars, rose 7%,
while total monthly charges soared 20%.
   Among the 15 doctors, six generated enough revenue to get
a bonus every month, earning an average of $5,045 a month,
while seven never received a bonus, earning an average of
$4,291. The doctors paid a bonus saw an average of 378
patients a month, while those who didn't saw an average of
276 patients. The variation in patient visits wasn't
explained.
   Doctors generated similar increases in charges per month,
regardless of their bonus status, indicating that an
incentive program can induce a group of doctors to prescribe
more services, even if only some of them benefit, the
researchers said.
   Despite the increased revenues, researchers said they
found "little evidence of gross overtreatment." The report is
from a larger study of Health Stop's operations conducted in
the mid-1980s.
   Mark Shankman, the concern's president and chief executive
officer, said the authors drew conclusions that "aren't fully
supported by their data," and suggested that one reason for
increased revenues is that patients are gaining confidence in
such clinics and coming in with more serious problems. He
also said the observed price increase was similar to national
increases. "While this type of study plays a role in health
care research," Dr. Shankman said, "we recommend caution in
interpreting this data, drawing conclusions about our medical
practices and making policy decisions."
   The study appears in today's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, which published an article 18 months ago
on the personal experience of a doctor who was fired from a
walk-in clinic because he failed to generate enough revenue
per patient. Arnold Relman, the journal's editor, is a
leading critic of for-profit medicine and its potential for
prompting practitioners to run up medical bills needlessly or
to withhold necessary care.
