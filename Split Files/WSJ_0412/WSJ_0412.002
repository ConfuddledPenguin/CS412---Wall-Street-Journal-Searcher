   Stock prices slipped a little while investors nudged bond
prices higher as financial markets remained in neutral during
the shortened holiday week.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.35 points to close
at 2729.73 in sluggish trading. Long-term bond prices
rebounded modestly from their sell-off Tuesday. The dollar
was mixed.

   Oil prices provided what little excitement there was in
financial markets yesterday. Oil prices tumbled in late New
York trading Tuesday and continued to fall yesterday after
the American Petroleum Institute released figures that showed
burgeoning inventories of crude oil. But speculation that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is on the verge
of calling an emergency meeting helped prices rebound late
yesterday.
   Although neither the stock nor the bond market reacted
sharply to the fluctuations in oil prices, tumbling crude
prices touched off a minor bond-market rally while prompting
investors to sell oil stocks and buy airlines issues.
   The gains in bond prices eased later as oil prices
rebounded, but the oil stocks ended down while airline issues
held on to most of their gains. Overall, though, stock
investors remain worried about the outlook for first-quarter
earnings.
   In major market action:

   Stock prices slipped slightly in slack trading. Volume on
the New York Stock Exchange totaled 141.1 million shares.
Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 762
to 720.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices edged higher. The Treasury's benchmark issue
ended nearly 1/4 point higher, a gain of about $2.50 for a
bond with a $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue
dropped to 8.57%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late afternoon New York trading
the currency was at 1.6715 marks and 158 yen, compared with
1.6755 marks and 157.60 yen Tuesday.
