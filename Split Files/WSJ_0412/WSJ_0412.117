   First Chicago Corp. shareholder sued the company, claiming
it violated securities law by misleading investors about its
financial condition.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
alleges that in 1989 and early 1990, the bank holding company
failed to disclose "adverse material information" and issued
"overly optimistic statements" about its prospects.

   On March 29, First Chicago disclosed that its
first-quarter earnings will be down about 50% because of
increased problems in its real-estate loan portfolio. First
Chicago, parent of First National Bank of Chicago, said it
expects to set aside between $150 million and $160 million
for loan losses in the quarter. The company had provided
similar information to analysts more than a week before the
public announcement.
   The lawsuit, filed by Edward J. Kunze, seeks class action
status. The complaint, which also names certain company
officials as defendants, seeks undetermined damages. A First
Chicago spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a company
policy against discussing litigation.
