   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it expects to report losses
through 1992 and negative cash flow through 1993 even if it
is successful in restructuring $1.8 billion in publicly
traded debt.
   The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores, which has
agreed to sell control of the company to Japanese investors
upon completion of the proposed debt swap, said in a
preliminary prospectus of the plan that it doesn't expect to
report a profit until 1993. Moreover, the company said it
expects cash flow to be, at best, break-even, between 1991
and 1997. Cash flow this year, however, is expected to be
positive, largely because of proceeds from the sale of its
50% stake in Citgo Petroleum Corp. in January.

   Southland said the projections assume that it completes
the debt restructuring, cutting its cash interest payments by
$1.6 billion between now and 1998, and that it increases its
capital spending and advertising efforts to improve its
competitive position.
   Despite the bleak projections, the company is expected to
have a difficult time selling its exchange offer to
bondholders. Southland is proposing swapping its bonds
outstanding, most of which currently pay cash interest and
mature between 1995 and 2002, for stock and zero-coupon bonds
that don't pay cash interest and mature between 1998 and
2003. The swap is part of a plan to recapitalize the
debt-heavy company by selling 75% of the stock to the owners
of its Japanese "Sebun-Irebun" stores for $400 million.
   Although the preliminary prospectus only became available
yesterday, a bondholders' group already has organized to
fight the plan, saying that the company should pay them cash
interest or otherwise sweeten the offer. In particular, the
group is angry that the Thompson family, which currently owns
most of Southland's stock, would retain about 15% of the
equity in the restructured company. Bondholders would own the
remaining 10%.
   In the prospectus, Southland blamed increasing competition
in the convenience store business for its failure to meet
projections made when it went private in a $4.9 billion
leveraged buy-out in 1987. The company said it has had to
sell more assets than it planned to meet its cash needs and
said it believes it will run into liquidity problems this
year. It also reiterated its belief that it will have to seek
bankruptcy-law protection if its financial restructuring
isn't completed.
   Southland said that to meet its amortization and
debt-service requirements between 1991 and 1997, its
operating earnings need to grow at an average of at least 22%
a year. However, over the last two years, its operating
earnings grew at an annual rate of 10%, and they are
projected to decline 24% in 1990.
   The company said that if the debt swap is completed, it
expects to spend its cash savings on improving existing
stores, taxes from the sale of its Citgo stake and an
aggressive store-opening program. Company projections show
that Southland hopes to open 134 new stores in 1991, 152 in
1992 and 230 in 1993, compared with just 52 this year. After
selling or closing 324 stores this year, the company says it
plans to sell or close 200 stores a year through 1997.
   Southland also said it expects to improve its merchandise
gross margins to 35% to 36% from 34.7% in 1989.
