   BEIJING -- David Richter was struck by Beijing's
tranquility when he returned this month after two years in
the U.S.
   "The place seems great. It's humming along," says Mr.
Richter, a director of WJS Inc., a U.S.-based trading
company. "Frankly, I had expected people in Beijing to look a
lot more downtrodden and beaten."

   Call it the Beijing paradox. On the surface, China's
capital seems to be thriving as never before. Markets and
shops are overflowing with vegetables, meat and electronic
gadgets. People go about their business in a relaxed,
carefree manner. Things generally seem stable.
   For many visitors, the apparent normalcy doesn't jibe with
the enduring image they have of Beijing: the massacre last
June 4, when tanks and troops killed hundreds of protesters.
That image is reinforced today, 10 months later, by news
reports depicting Beijing's population as still chafing under
the strict control of a police state.
   So what's the real story?
   "Superficially, this place seems very normal," says a
Western diplomat and longtime China watcher. "But you only
have to scratch the surface ever so slightly to realize that
things are unstable to the core."
   That view is shared by many foreign analysts living in
Beijing, as well as by a large segment of the local
population.
   "The Communist Party irretrievably lost Beijing last
year," says a Chinese scholar, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. "An entire city now lies in wait for a chance to
rise up and avenge the massacre." In the meantime, the
scholar says, the Chinese plod along, practicing an art they
have mastered over the centuries: keeping their heads down.
   In her latest book, writer Bette Bao Lord, wife of the
former U.S. ambassador to Beijing, relates a Chinese friend's
comments immediately after last June's killings. China's
leaders, the friend warned, "are masters of orchestrating a
misery all the more insidious because it is silent and
invisible."
   Publicly, people are careful not to contradict the
official line: that last year's pro-democracy movement was
actually a "counterrevolutionary rebellion" organized by a
handful of criminals. Only in private do people express their
opinions, and they are nearly universally despairing.
   Despite the widespread grumbling, there seems to be only
one person among the country's 1.1 billion citizens who dares
speak out. He is Hou Dejian, a popular singer who, along with
three intellectuals, staged a hunger strike on Tiananmen
Square just before the troops stormed in. The 33-year-old,
who was born on Taiwan but holds a Chinese passport, risks
imprisonment for his outspokenness. He is gambling that his
fame will protect him.
   "There are two possibilities for China: peaceful evolution
or violent revolution," says Mr. Hou, who now spends his days
playing pool at a local hotel. "The Communist Party is
pushing China toward violent revolution. The longer they
resist people's desire for democracy, the more terrible the
result will be."
   If the apparent political calm is illusory, what about the
economy? Most foreign experts say the economy is in deep
trouble. But Chinese statistics suggest that, in some
respects, the economy is healthier than it was a year ago,
before the unrest. Annual inflation, which peaked last year
at about 30%, is down to 3.3%. And markets in major cities
are well stocked.
   But here again, appearances can be deceiving. The cost of
bringing down inflation has been zero or negative industrial
growth, and unemployment has reached record levels. Even the
abundance of supplies in shops and markets are cause for
alarm, some experts say.
   "The shelves are full because no one is buying," says a
Western economist. "If anything were to happen to spark
renewed panic buying, the shelves would be cleaned out in a
minute. And, since China's industry is dead, there would be
no stocks out there to replace them. That's when to start
worrying about major unrest."
   Another clue to the problems lurking beneath the surface,
analysts say, is the Chinese leadership's obsession with
"stability." To preserve it, controversial issues are simply
sidestepped. During the recent National People's Congress,
for example, delegates received clear signals that they
weren't to debate last year's turmoil and suppression.
Moreover, the Communist Party scrapped plans for major
personnel changes, apparently to preserve the pretext of
unity at the top.
   But despite frequent claims that everything is under
control, China's leaders this month revealed the extent of
their fears. In response to rumors that Beijing residents
might demonstrate on key anniversaries of last year's
protests, authorities dispatched troops, armed police and
plainclothes men to every corner of the city. They also
sealed off Tiananmen Square. And they sent convoys of
security forces around the city on motorcycles, police jeeps,
unmarked cars and bicycles.
   The initial anniversaries passed without incident. But
some disaffected Chinese view the government's overreaction
as a small victory. "The government blinked," says one young
intellectual.
   Beijing's uneasy calm is likely to prevail, most analysts
agree, until the death of Deng Xiaoping, who at 85 is still
thought to be China's supreme leader. Most assume that
intense jockeying for power in post-Deng China is already
under way. That struggle could well play itself out both
behind the walls of the Party's Zhongnanhai compound and by
the masses taking to the streets.
