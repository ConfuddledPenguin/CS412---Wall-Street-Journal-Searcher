   NEW YORK -- Stocks drifted slightly lower as widespread
selling of oil issues, stemming from the recent decline in
crude-oil prices, weighed on the market.
   While the price of oil abruptly reversed course during the
session on reports that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries might hold an emergency meeting to
address the slump in world oil markets, the rebound failed to
stem the weakness in energy stocks.

   With blue-chip oil issues under pressure, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed with a decline of 1.35 at 2729.73
after spending the session in a narrow range.
   Energy-related stocks captured 10 of the top 18 places on
the New York Stock Exchange's list of most active issues, but
trading overall remained lackluster. Big Board volume
amounted to 141,080,000 shares, a modest improvement over
Tuesday's total of 136,020,000 shares.
   The pace of activity slowed substantially during the
afternoon as the market started to wind down in advance of
the observance of Good Friday, for which U.S. stock exchanges
will be closed.
   Among broader market measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index slid 0.15 to 341.92 and the NYSE Composite Index
dropped 0.06 to 187.57, while the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained .04 to 318.32. Decliners edged advancers on the
Big Board by 762 to 720.
   John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy
committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, described the session as
"a pretty listless day, with the exception of the oils having
their problems."
   Oil stocks contributing to the decline in the industrial
average included Exxon, which fell 3/8 to 45 5/8; Chevron,
which tumbled 1 3/4 to 65 7/8; Texaco, which dropped 1 to 57
3/8; and USX, which dropped 5/8 to 34. All but Chevron also
ranked among the most active on the Big Board; USX set the
pace for the group, as 1.7 million shares changed hands in
composite trading.
   Other oil issues taking high places on the Big Board's
most actives list included Amoco, which went down 7/8 to 50
1/2; Mobil, down 1 to 59 5/8; Phillips Petroleum, down 1/2 to
25 3/8; Occidental Petroleum, down 1/4 to 26 7/8; and Unocal,
down 1/2 to 29 3/4.
   Crude-oil futures plummeted in early New York trading,
sparking the sell-off in the oil sector. May futures on West
Texas Intermediate crude skidded to a low of $16.25 a barrel
before recovering to settle at $18.06 a barrel, up 38 cents
on the day.
   But several oil analysts warned that oil prices are likely
to decline further over the short run, leading to further
pressure on oil companies' shares. Against the backdrop of
those forecasts, "the recovery in the crude market had very
little to do with oil stocks," Mr. Connolly said.
   Two oil-field services stocks, Schlumberger and Baker
Hughes, rounded out the list of the 10 most heavily traded
energy issues. Schlumberger fell 1 to 50 as 1.4 million
shares were traded, while Baker Hughes declined 1 3/8 to 25
7/8 on 1.2 million shares.
   Rowan, whose first-quarter results fell short of most
analysts' expectations, dropped 1/2 to 12. The company
reported a loss of nine cents a share for the period.
Elsewhere in the oil-services group, Halliburton dropped 5/8
to 43 1/2 and Helmerich &amp; Payne fell 1 to 32 1/2.
   But there were some exceptions to the rule in energy
issues, including Ashland Oil, which climbed 7/8 to 36 5/8,
and Sun, which rose 3/8 to 37 1/4. Kidder Peabody reaffirmed
its buy recommendations on the two refiners, based on "very
fat and healthy" margins between the prices of crude oil and
petroleum products despite the price declines in both.
   Three airline stocks posted gains after Prudential-Bache
Securities initiated coverage of the companies with buy
recommendations: AMR, the owner of American Airlines, which
went up 7/8 to 66 1/4; Delta Air Lines, up 1 1/8 to 73 5/8,
and Midway Airlines, up 1/2 to 13.
   Although airlines stand to benefit from lower oil prices
through reduced costs for jet fuel, other issues in the
sector finished mixed. UAL, the parent company of United
Airlines, fell 1 to 160 1/4; Southwest Airlines rose 3/4 to
25; Pan Am dropped 1/8 to 2 7/8; and Alaska Air Group added
3/8 to 23 1/2.
   Federal National Mortgage Association, which reported that
first-quarter earnings surged about 68%, rallied 7/8 to 35 on
1.2 million shares. The results were better than analysts had
generally expected.
   United Telecommunications retreated 1 7/8 to 40 1/4 on two
million shares after rising a total of 2 3/8 Monday and
Tuesday on the news of MCI Communications' agreement to
acquire Telecom USA, a rival in the long-distance phone
market.
   United Telecommunications told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report that it expects to report its first-quarter
earnings on Tuesday. PaineWebber analyst Jack Grubman noted
that the company has indicated it expects to post net income
for the quarter of about 50 cents to 55 cents a share, down
from an earlier projection of 55 cents to 60 cents.
   Woolworth went up 3/4 to 62 1/4. The company's board
declared a 2-to-1 stock split and increased the quarterly
dividend by 11%.
   TCBY Enterprises gained 1 1/8 to 22 1/8. Shearson Lehman
Hutton reiterated a favorable rating on the stock, based on
early indications that McDonald's introduction of frozen
yogurt in certain areas of the U.S. doesn't appear to be
posing a serious threat to the company.
   Norton jumped 3 1/8 to 76. A federal judge ordered the
company, which is fighting a $75-a-share tender offer from
Britain's BTR PLC, to hold its annual meeting April 27 as it
had originally scheduled. After BTR made its offer, Norton
canceled the meeting, saying it needed more time to weigh
alternatives.
   Apple Bancorp advanced 1 7/8 to 43 3/4. Its directors
rejected a $38-a-share takeover offer from New York real
estate investor Stanley Stahl, its largest shareholder, and
directed its management to seek other possible bids.
   West Point-Pepperell surged 5 to 42 5/8. The Wall Street
Journal reported that investor William Farley plans to
surrender his majority ownership of the company in connection
with a debt restructuring.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index, weighted
heavily with oil stocks, fell 1.98 to 357.54. Volume totaled
13,520,000 shares, compared with 11,770,315 shares Tuesday.
There were 233 issues advancing, 282 declining and 292 were
unchanged.
   Among energy-related Amex issues, Imperial Oil Class A
retreated 1 5/8 to 50 1/2, Mitchell Energy &amp; Development
dropped 1 to 19 1/8, Global Natural Resources fell 1/2 to 7
3/4 and Energy Service dropped 1/4 to 4 3/4.
   Jan Bell Marketing tumbled 1 1/2 to 8 3/8 on 1.8 million
shares. Goldman Sachs cut its 1990 earnings estimate by 20
cents a share to 75 cents a share, citing its belief that the
company's first-quarter sales were about even with the
year-earlier level. The company declined to comment.
   ENSR jumped 2 1/8 to 8 after agreeing to be acquired for
$8.25 a share by NuKEM G.m.b.H., a West German company. The
accord permits ENSR to hold talks with any other potential
bidders that may emerge.
