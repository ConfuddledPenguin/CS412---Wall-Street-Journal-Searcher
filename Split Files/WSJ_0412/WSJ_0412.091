   Some manufacturers have stopped shipping goods to Ames
Department Stores Inc. because of the discount department
store chain's financial problems.
   Shipments of hardware, clothing and other items --
seasonable goods needed to stock the retailer's shelves for
the spring -- have been put on hold at loading docks for the
past month by some vendors who still haven't been paid for
earlier shipments.

   The delay in shipments could worsen the financial
difficulties of Ames, which earlier this week said it expects
to report a $228 million loss for its fiscal year ended Jan.
27 and plans to close 74 of its 680 stores. The loss stems
largely from Ames's inability so far to turn around the
troubled former Zayre department stores that it acquired in
1988.
   A lack of deliveries from vendors helped push two Campeau
Corp. subsidiaries -- Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. -- into filing for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
earlier this year. "Ames is Campeau in the making," said
Steve Herman, a Boston retail consultant.
   In addition to waiting for payments on past deliveries,
Ames vendors said they are holding up shipments pending
further word on whether Ames can successfully negotiate a new
credit agreement with its banks and get a capital infusion
that it is seeking.
   "The clock is ticking for Ames," said Alan Millstein,
publisher of a fashion network report in New York. "Spring
sales are big for any retailer. In the next few months
back-to-school stuff should start shipping. These are
critical moments in the cycle. If back-to-school doesn't
ship, they're dead."
   Gerber Childrenswear Inc., a unit of Gerber Products Co.,
said it won't ship $1 million of spring wear ordered by Ames
until it is paid some of the $1.2 million owed by Ames for
winter clothing, some of it shipped in November, a member of
Gerber management said. "We've written letters. . . . We sent
the company faxes. We've called Ames every day for the last
three months. No response," the manager said. "We're not the
only {vendors}. An army of people out there who service Ames
are angry."
   PepsiCo Inc. said it isn't making soft drink deliveries to
Ames unless it is paid in cash. "We don't like to do this as
a rule, {but} just with companies that can't pay, like Ames,"
a company manager said.
   Also, at least one factoring agency, which buys
manufacturers' receivables and assumes the risk that the
bills will be paid, has advised a number of apparel makers
not to ship until a clearer financial picture emerges. "The
ball's in Ames's court," said the credit manager of the New
York agency.
   Meanwhile, many merchants are getting nervous. "In the
last two days I've had a number of vendors call me asking,
`Should I ship, should I ship?' " said Wayne Hood, a retail
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Ames didn't return calls seeking comment. The company's
stock, which has dropped sharply in recent days, closed
yesterday at $2.50, up 12.5 cents on very heavy volume of
about 2.3 millions shares in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   The blocked shipments have placed the Rocky Hill, Conn.,
company in "a precarious Catch-22 position that no company
ever wants to be in," said Howard Davidowitz, a retailing and
financial consultant in New York. "The vendors want to know
what the banks are going to do and the banks want to know if
the vendors are going to ship. It's panic time." He added,
"They desperately need someone to take a stake in the company
and help rebuild their balance sheet."
   In addition to seeking a capital infusion, Ames hopes to
ease its cash pinch by closing stores and selling their
inventory. It currently is negotiating a sale of goods in the
74 stores it is closing to Jerome Schottenstein, a Columbus,
Ohio, merchandise liquidator. Mr. Schottenstein declined
comment, citing the negotiations. It's believed that
inventory sale could provide Ames with $75 million to $100
million in cash.
   Ames received about $75 million in a similar sale of goods
to Mr. Schottenstein last year when the company closed 74
Zayre stores, estimated Edward Comeau, an analyst for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Mr. Comeau, however, added that the closing of 74 stores
"may not be significant enough. I've advised all our people
to get out of the stock. . . . We felt another 100 to 200
stores ought to be closed" to resolve Ames's problems.
   By Mr. Comeau's calculation, Ames had used up
approximately $300 million of its $475 million revolving
credit as of last month. And that was before the April 10
deadline for most retailers in the industry to pay their
largest vendors. Along with interest payments on bank debt,
Ames runs the risk of running out of credit unless it can
renegotiate its lending agreement, analysts suggested.
