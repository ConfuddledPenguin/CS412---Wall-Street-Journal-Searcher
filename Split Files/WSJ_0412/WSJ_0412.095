   ARMSTRONG WORLD INDUSTRIES Inc. realized a $2.7 million
gain in the 1989 first quarter as a result of certain
litigation settlements. Sales in the 1989 first quarter were
$619 million as recently restated by the company. In
yesterday's edition, the gain was incorrectly attributed to
the 1990 first quarter and the sales figure was misstated.
