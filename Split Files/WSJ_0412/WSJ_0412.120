   Ciba-Geigy in 1984 acquired the Western European rights to
the U.S. company's animal health products businesses. The
current agreement covers Bristol-Myers Squibb's operations in
Asia, Australia, Canada and Latin America.
   The acquisition "comprises veterinary products for the
treatment of domestic and farm animals," according to a
statement released by Ciba-Geigy.
   The company also said the 170 employees of the
Bristol-Myers Squibb operations will be offered jobs on
"comparable terms" under Ciba-Geigy's ownership.
   In 1989, the Bristol-Myers Squibb animal health products
businesses had sales of $40 million.
