   From a letter to the Times of London by Antony Rouse, on
March 16:

   That's terrific news you report (March 13) -- the creation
of a subsidiary of Oxford University in Japan -- but it needs
development.
   Give them a subsidiary of Eton, a branch of the Guards
Officers' Mess at Wellington Barracks, a replica of White's
Club and the Japanese economy will be on its knees within a
generation.
