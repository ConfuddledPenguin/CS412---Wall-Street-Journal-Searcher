   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said it plans to sell three units
as part of its strategy to sharpen its focus on certain
information markets.
   The New York-based information company said its Neodata
Services, Petroleum Information and Zytron units had combined
revenue of about $200 million last year. Each is profitable,
D&amp;B said, without elaborating. Nor did D&amp;B estimate how much
it expected to get for the units.

   Neodata provides subscription-fulfillment services to more
than 270 publications. Petroleum Information supplies
drilling, production and gas-transportation data; and Zytron
provides services and products to larger computer users.
   D&amp;B reiterated its expectation of posting 1990 per-share
earnings of about $2.80. In 1989, net income was $586.4
million, or $3.14 a share, on revenue of $4.32 billion.
