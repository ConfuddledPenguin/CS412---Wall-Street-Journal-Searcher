   HICKSVILLE, N.Y. -- Newmark &amp; Lewis Inc., a New York-area
discount retailer of home appliances and electronics, said it
named Ron Fleisher, 43 years old, president and chief
operating officer, effective May 1.
   The appointment of Mr. Fleisher, who was president of the
Eastern region of Silo Inc., a national appliance and
electronics retailer, marks the first time Newmark &amp; Lewis
hired an outsider as president. The operating chief's post is
new; as president, Mr. Fleisher will succeed Richard Lewis,
66, who will become co-chairman with Warren Hyman, 68.

   The company said Mr. Fleisher's hiring will permit Messrs.
Lewis and Hyman, who are also to be co-chief executive
officers, to spend more time on planning and strategic
growth.
   Mr. Fleisher's appointment is to coincide with Newmark &amp;
Lewis's anticipated addition of 17 stores it expects to
acquire for $7.8 million and the assumption of some
liabilities from Brick Church Appliance Inc., Edison, N.J.
Following that, Newmark &amp; Lewis will have a total of 67
stores.
