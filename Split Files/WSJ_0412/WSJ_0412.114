   Damon Group Inc., formerly American Magnetics Corp., said
it sold its electronics products business to the U.S. unit of
Britain-based System 4 International B.V., an
electronic-access control products distributor, for $12
million, including $8 million in cash and the remainder in a
subordinated note.
   Damon Group said the sale, expected to close by June 15,
is part of its refocusing on medical clinical laboratory
operations, following its acquisition through Nomad Partners
Limited Partnership last year of Damon, a Needham Heights,
Mass.-based biotechnology and medical laboratory concern.
Since the Damon acquisition, the company also has sold its
hobby products and medical equipment businesses, and a
spokeswoman said it might sell some real estate in the
refocusing effort.
