   BOSTON -- A federal court judge here dealt a major setback
to Norton Co. in its effort to fend off BTR PLC's $1.64
billion hostile bid, ordering Norton to hold its annual
meeting as scheduled April 26.
   Norton immediately appealed the decision, saying in an
affidavit that it "will have no choice but to put Norton up
for sale" if the meeting isn't delayed.

   London-based BTR is expected to proceed with a proxy fight
to unseat Norton's board. Norton, a Worcester, Mass.-based
chemicals and abrasives maker, had canceled its annual
meeting and scheduled a special shareholders meeting June 26,
citing the need for time to pursue other options such as a
"white squire" minority partner.
   The ruling is a major blow to Norton because the company
itself conceded in a hearing last week that it was unlikely
to prevail in a proxy fight if the annual meeting were held
as scheduled.
   In an interview in London, John Cahill, BTR chief
executive officer, said BTR "absolutely" will go ahead with
its proxy fight in light of the court decision. He added that
initial indications showed that "between 50% and 70%" of
Norton holders had tendered their shares to BTR under the
offer that began last month. Speaking of the court decision,
Mr. Cahill said: "We are very pleased about the result. It
changes the ballgame."
   Holding the meeting April 26 will force shareholders to
vote "before the board has had a reasonable opportunity to
explore alternatives," said John M. Nelson, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   BTR, which launched its $75-a-share cash bid March 15,
said that shareholders "now will have a timely opportunity to
take steps to have Norton Co. remove the obstacles" to its
tender offer.
   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro cited
Norton's own bylaws that prohibit changing the date of an
annual meeting within 60 days of its scheduled date. The case
"clearly tips in (BTR's) favor because its legitimate
interest in enforcing Norton's bylaws -- a contract made for
the shareholders' benefit -- must trump the (Norton) board's
interest in circumscribing them."
   Norton has insisted that BTR's offer is inadequate, but
analysts are skeptical that Norton can come up with a
recapitalization or other alternative worth enough to top the
BTR bid. They think Norton could get only $65 to $70 even by
loading the company up with debt. "I don't see what basic
defense they could have against the fact that $75 is a lot
more than the stock has ever sold for," said David Sutliff of
S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. "I can't conceive of an alternative the
company could put in place to get that kind of return to
shareholders."
   One Wall Street source said Norton will try to have its
appeal heard as early as next Tuesday. Takeover stock traders
and Wall Street people said that if the April 26 date is
upheld, it's likely to force Norton to try to find a white
knight or negotiate a friendly deal with BTR.
   Traders said an April 26 meeting would eliminate a
possible Norton defense of selling a block of stock to a
friendly holder, or employee stock ownership plan, that could
block a takeover. Because only Norton shareholders as of
March 2 may vote at an April 26 meeting, new friendly
investors couldn't vote to block the purchase.
   Traders said yesterday's $3.125 jump in the stock price,
to $76 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, reflected the betting that a friendly transaction
would be negotiated in the range of $78 to $80 a share. BTR
has said it would be willing to pay more if Norton would open
its books and show that the value is there.
   Norton has painted BTR as a heartless foreign raider and
rallied state legislators to its cause. A bill now before the
state Senate would make it more time consuming to prevail in
a proxy fight against Massachusetts-based companies. The bill
would require all companies in the state to have staggered
directors' terms, unless the board votes otherwise. Under the
proposed law, installing a new slate of directors through a
proxy fight would take at least a year or more.
   But traders and Wall Street sources don't believe the
Massachusetts law can be passed until April 21 or later,
which might be too late for Norton. One Wall Street source
said Norton's directors probably couldn't prudently wait
until the last minute before seeking white-knight buyers, a
step that could effectively put the company up for sale.
   A Senate aide said the bill had been returned to committee
this week for amendment after opponents raised constitutional
questions about the measure. "We were hoping to see the bill
out by early next week, and assuming we can overcome the
technical objections, we still hope to see fast action on the
bill," the staff member said.
   Separately, Norton said it completed the $550 million sale
of its Eastman Christensen Co. to Baker Hughes Inc. Under the
agreement, in addition to the cash payment, Baker is to
assume $8 million in debt and issue a five-year warrant to
Norton to purchase as many as eight million shares of Baker's
common at $36.75 a share.
