   SHELTON, Conn. -- TIE/communications Inc., a supplier of
telephone systems, said it bought back preferred shares from
a Pritzker family entity, HCR Partners, in exchange for a
note valued at $46.5 million and warrants.
   Under the agreement, TIE said it will pay $15 million of
the note to HCR, which is controlled by Pritzker family
interests, after TIE completes the sale of certain
operations; $4 million is scheduled to be paid on May 1,
1991, and the rest in monthly installments through 1996. The
note carries a 10% annual interest rate and is secured by
substantially all of TIE's assets.
