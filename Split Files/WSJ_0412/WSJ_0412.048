   DECLINE OF BRITISH TV

   Government deregulation is bringing a plethora of
conventional and satellite television channels to British
homes, but studies show audiences are down 10% from five
years ago.
   Some of the audience decline "is attributable to video,"
said the director of London Weekend Television, one of the
government's 15 regional franchises. But, he added, "the same
period saw a considerable increase in alternative leisure
activities," such as dining out.
   Britons still watch an average of 25 hours and 21 minutes
of TV every week, but 44% of those tuned in say they find
nothing appealing.
   The situation is troubling to an industry facing both
proposed legislation that would create a fifth land-based
channel and the start this month of a satellite network that
will add five channels. Another London Weekend official says
"the existing cake will have to be carved up in a larger
number of portions."
                                                                                                       

   TOKYO PROJECT FOR CESAR PELLI
                                                                                                       

   Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. said it has given a one
billion yen ($6.3 million) order to a U.S.-Japanese
consortium to design its new head office in Tokyo. The
company gave the order to Cesar Pelli &amp; Yamashita Associated
Architects, a joint venture between the U.S.'s Cesar Pelli &amp;
Associates and Japan's Yamashita Architects &amp; Engineers Inc.
The project has been closely watched as a test case of
Japan's commitment to allow greater access by foreign
companies to its construction market.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH FASHION LOOKS EAST

   A group of France's most prominent fashion houses,
including those of Yves Saint Laurent and Emanuel Ungaro,
will stage a fashion show in Budapest next March. Jacques
Mouclier, president of the Chambre Syndicale, Paris's
official fashion organization, said sales to East Europe now
accounted for a negligible share of French fashion's $625
million export market. "The last 10 years were the Asian
decade," he said. "The next decade we're going to devote all
our energies to penetrating the East."
                                                                                                       

   U.S. WOOD FOR JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Progress in the current round of U.S.-Japan wood-product
trade negotiations has been disappointing, U.S. wood-product
industry officials said yesterday in Tokyo. The officials
said antiquated building codes and product standards are a
non-tariff barrier keeping non-Japanese wood products out of
Japan. Among those obstacles is a limit on the height of
wooden buildings. The U.S. officials said current U.S.
wood-product exports to Japan amount to $2.8 billion,
consisting almost entirely of unprocessed raw wood.
                                                                                                       

   AIDS IN KUWAIT
                                                                                                       

   Fifteen new cases of AIDS were detected in Kuwait in the
last two months, all of them involving foreigners, the
newspaper Al-Rai al-Aam reported. The paper quoted a Health
Ministry spokesman as saying, "The new AIDS carriers were
deported on the spot." Kuwait has had a total of 70 cases of
AIDS, the spokesman reportedly said, adding that in the
latest cases symptoms of AIDS were found during tests on
incoming foreign laborers.
                                                                                                       

   PRESERVING CANADIAN SPRUCES
                                                                                                       

   The government of Canada's province of British Columbia
said it will introduce legislation to ban logging in much of
a remote valley containing the world's tallest spruce trees.
But the government said MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of North
America's largest forest-products companies, will be allowed
to harvest trees in just under half the 16,555-acre Carmanah
Valley on Vancouver Island. Environmental groups, who had
demanded that the government ban loggers from the entire
forest, called the partial ban a sellout.
                                                                                                       

   LINKS TO EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   A total of 599 joint ventures have been signed between
East German and foreign companies, and another 400 will be
completed by the end of this month, according to a report by
the East German news agency ADN.
   The agency said 96% of the joint ventures had been signed
with West German companies; the remaining 4% were signed with
partners from Switzerland, Austria, the Soviet Union, the
U.S., Denmark, Japan, Yugoslavia, Holland, Sweden, Spain,
Turkey and Hungary.
   Most of the deals were signed by small and medium-sized
East German companies, the agency said. It said more than 90%
of the joint ventures have taken the legal form of a limited
liability company, or G.m.b.H.
   About 60% of the joint ventures are in the service and
tourism industry, while 30% are in the industrial sector.
East Berlin is by far the most popular choice for the joint
ventures, with 218.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the Polish-born heiress to the
Johnson &amp; Johnson health-products fortune, opened an exhibit
of religious art from her personal collection at Warsaw's
Royal Palace. The exhibit includes works by Titian,
Caravaggio and Raphael, and proceeds from catalog sales will
be donated to Polish cultural-conservation efforts. . . .
China will send 3,000 students abroad this year, most of them
older students on short-term programs, an official report
said. In the past 12 years, China has sent between 60,000 and
80,000 students to foreign countries, and nearly half didn't
return.
