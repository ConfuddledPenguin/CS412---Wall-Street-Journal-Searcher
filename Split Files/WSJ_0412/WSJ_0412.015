   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration said
Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp., paid
$215,000 to settle charges of safety violations.
   The FAA uncovered the alleged problems during inspections
in a five-week period in October and November of 1988. The
series of inspections was one of the most intensive ever
conducted by the agency.

   The agency said the violations included operating a Boeing
Co. 727 in passenger service with an inoperative escape
slide, not repairing a cargo-hold heater on a DC10 within the
required period of time and failing to update the airline's
operations manual. The airline also improperly weighed an
aircraft, the FAA said.
   Continental, in paying the fine, didn't admit that the
violations occurred, the FAA said. The agency said the
airline responded quickly to remedy the problems.
   In Houston, a Continental spokesman said, "While we have
some technical differences on some of the FAA's findings,
we've agreed to the settlement in the interest of moving
ahead." He noted that the findings didn't involve any
safety-of-flight violations and called the settlement one of
the lowest in recent aviation inspections.
