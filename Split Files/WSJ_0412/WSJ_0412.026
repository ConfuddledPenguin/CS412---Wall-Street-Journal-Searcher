   In a statement, Raytheon said its total order backlog grew
to $9.49 billion, including funded U.S. government orders of
$6.84 billion. Backlog at the close of last year's first
quarter was $8.88 billion, including a government-funded

   Thomas L. Phillips, chairman and chief executive, said
that in the first quarter, the electronics segment,
Raytheon's largest, performed well, while the aircraft and
energy-services segments continued rapid profit growth and
all five business units remained profitable. "Raytheon
continues to grow on the strength of its diversified
government and commercial business base," Mr. Phillips said.

higher sales and improved profit margins. During the quarter,
