   NEW YORK -- Another round of token intervention failed to
revive the Japanese yen and convinced many traders that the
Group of Seven industrial nations is unwilling to throw any
weight behind its recent statements.
   But while the dollar finished the global session firmer
against the yen, it was mixed against other major currencies.

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6715 marks, down from 1.6755 marks late Tuesday, and at
158 yen, up from 157.60 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6433, down from $1.6453 Tuesday.
   Early Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 158.45
yen, off slightly from Wednesday's close of 158.50 yen in
Tokyo.
   A handful of European central banks, led by the West
German central bank, moved to blunt the U.S. unit's advance
against the yen early in the New York session, selling
dollars for yen as the U.S. currency climbed well above 158
yen.
   But currency dealers said yesterday's intervention, like
Monday's central-bank performance, was little more than a
symbolic effort.
   Some estimated that no more than $100 million was sold on
behalf of the Bank of Japan. The Bank of Japan staged its own
small-scale intervention earlier in the day, with little
effect.
   To some dealers, the conspicuous absence of the Federal
Reserve from yesterday's dollar sales offered further proof
that the U.S. is reluctant to prop up the Japanese currency
while Japan refrains from raising interest rates.
   On Saturday, the G-7 ministers -- representatives from the
U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada
-- met in Paris. They said the yen's decline against the
dollar and European currencies would have "undesirable
consequences" for the world economy.
   Since then, market debate has focused on whether the major
industrial democracies are prepared to aggressively support
the Japanese currency.
   Earl I. Johnson, with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in
Chicago, said that the impression persists in the market that
the G-7 isn't eager to stage an all-out campaign to halt the
yen's decline.
   "It's apparent there's no G-7 pact to support yen," he
added.
   For some participants, the mark's movements against the
yen were the main focus of the day.
   In Tokyo, the mark climbed to 94.71 yen from 93.39 yen
late Tuesday and finished the New York day at 94.46 yen,
compared to 94.08 yen a day earlier.
   "The phenomenon is the mark's rise against the yen more
than the dollar-yen" rate, and "the trend is clearly a
continued strengthening of the mark against the yen," Scott
Greene, chief dealer at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., said.
   Talk has crept into the market that Japan might move to
raise interest rates this weekend. But, according to Mr.
Greene, while a rate boost might temporarily strengthen the
yen, any recovery would be short-lived.
   The market has already factored such a move into trading,
Mr. Greene said.
   Japan last raised its discount rate in early March,
lifting it a full percentage point to 5.25%. The discount
rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial
banks.
   Meanwhile, a more optimistic view of German monetary
unification has settled on the market recently, restoring
some of the mark's vigor.
   But traders said that a new mark bullishness hasn't yet
taken hold. They caution that key details of the monetary
merger still aren't worked out.
   Sterling is suffering another periodic bout of weakness,
with some players nervously bailing out ahead of the release
today of Britain's inflation data for March and unemployment
figures for February.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $374.30 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong, gold opened Thursday at $375.15 an ounce.
