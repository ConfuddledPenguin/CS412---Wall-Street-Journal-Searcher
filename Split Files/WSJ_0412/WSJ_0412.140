   VICTORIA, British Columbia -- The British Columbia
government said it plans to preserve as parkland more than
half of the 26-square-mile Carmanah Valley, a battleground
between environmentalists and loggers that reputedly contains
Canada's tallest trees.
   The decision, following months of debate between
environmental groups and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., a forest
products firm that has cutting rights to the timber, was an
attempt at compromise that apparently satisfied neither side.

   MacMillan Bloedel said the move would cost 150 jobs and
could set a precedent for other land-use disputes, which
currently affect about 30% of a license area on Vancouver
Island that includes Carmanah, and about 3% of the province's
total timber-cutting land.
   The Western Canada Wilderness Committee, an environmental
group, said it is considering court action to block the plan,
which requires legislation before it can proceed.
   MacMillan Bloedel, 49.9%-owned by Noranda Forest Inc., a
unit of Toronto resource giant Noranda Inc., had proposed to
set aside a 1,300-acre tract on the valley floor that
contains the oldest trees, including a 311-foot Sitka spruce
that is believed to be the world's tallest.
   Forests Minister Claude Richmond said compensation that
must be paid to MacMillan Bloedel for the loss of
timber-cutting rights "could amount to millions of dollars."
