   The potential Soviet "peace dividend" is very large
relative to that of the U.S., yet its effect in raising
living standards for the average Soviet consumer probably
will be surprisingly small.
   Spending on the military and security-related purposes as
a percentage of Soviet GNP has been variously estimated as 9%
(by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov), 16% (by the CIA),
and about 25% (by a small group of independent scholars,
sometimes referred to outside and inside government as "Team
B").

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has already announced
cuts in that spending of some 14.2% spread over the next few
years. In fact, even a 25% cut in defense spending -- a cut
twice as large as that which Mr. Gorbachev is offering --
will provide little improvement for the Soviet consumer.
Here's why.
   Assuming a national security budget of 20% of GNP (a
figure between the Team B and CIA estimates), transferring
one quarter of it from national security would make an
additional 5% of GNP available for civilian purposes. At
present, civilian consumption in the Soviet Union takes
something between 50% and 55% of GNP. So the 5% of GNP
transferred from the military to consumers would boost their
share of the economy to between 55% and 60.5% -- permitting
them collectively to consume a total of 10% more than they do
now.
   But that 10% raise is to be phased in over four years.
Collective civilian consumption could therefore grow by just
2.25% annually. Unfortunately, the Soviet population is
simultaneously growing at an annual rate of 1%. So even with
very optimistic assumptions about the size and the speed of
defense budget cuts, the average Soviet citizen is looking at
no more than a 1.25% annual increase in his or her personal
consumption, for a cumulative individual increase of 5% by
1995.
   In dollar terms, that projected increase looks even worse.
Soviet per-capita consumption is about $3,000 --
approximately the same as that of Mexico and Turkey. An
additional 1.25% a year translates into added consumption of
about $40, or $160 over four years.
   Worse, this would be a one-time increase. In the absence
of other changes in the Soviet economy, Soviet consumption
would settle at this plateau. If part of the "dividend" were
devoted to investment in consumer goods industry rather than
to raising consumption directly, the initial boost to
consumption would be smaller than the previous estimate, but
prospects for further growth after 1995 would be greater.
   To be sure, these calculations assume that the economic
aspects of "perestroika" remain about as unsuccessful as they
have been for most of Mr. Gorbachev's tenure since 1985. If
on the other hand, significant reforms do occur with respect
to price deregulation, control of the money supply,
imposition of fiscal discipline, privatization of state
enterprises (perhaps to absorb a substantial part of the
so-called ruble "overhang" of about 400-500 billion rubles),
property rights reform and currency convertibility, prospects
for significant betterment of the consumer's lot would be
substantially improved -- even in the absence of as large a
"peace dividend" from military cuts as I have assumed.
   Of course, the Soviets do have other options. A
combination of military cuts and economic reform would be
more likely to produce substantial benefits for the Soviet
consumer than either alone. But, by itself, the "peace
dividend" won't do very much.
   So systemic economic reform is required. Unfortunately,
the Soviet record on this score has been unimpressive.
Without significant economic reform, assistance by foreign
governments is likely to be wasted, while loans or
investments by foreign businesses are likely to be risky and
unrewarding.
