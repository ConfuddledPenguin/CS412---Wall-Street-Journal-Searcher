   New York City, joined by Los Angeles and Chicago, took
court action against the U.S. Commerce Department, which they
accused of reneging on an agreement to correct the Census
Bureau's undercounting of minorities.
   The bureau's undercounting, which is about five times
greater for minorities than for others, is a problem for many
cities and states because the census is used in calculating
federal aid and allotting congressional seats. New York City
claims undercounting in the 1980 census cost it $675 million
in federal aid over the past decade and the loss of at least
one congressional seat.

   The cities and other parties concerned about the
undercounting sued the Commerce Department in 1988. Last
July, in what was widely seen as a victory for the cities,
the department agreed to develop guidelines for adjusting the
undercounting.
   But in a motion filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York City and other critics of the Census Bureau said the
department guidelines put politics ahead of accuracy.
   The guidelines were to be used to evaluate whether the
census would be more accurate if it were statistically
adjusted to make up for the undercounting. But attorneys for
New York said the guidelines amounted to a list of reasons
against adjusting the census count.
   "Just as you can't get blood from a stone, it appears
impossible to get a fair and full count from the Department
of Commerce," New York Mayor David Dinkins said in a
statement.
   Peter Zimroth, a former New York corporation counsel and
one of the attorneys handling the case, said, "The Commerce
Department has refused to promulgate standards for
determining which set of data, the adjusted or the unadjusted
census count, will be more accurate."
   New York's motion was joined by Dade County, Florida; the
state of California; New York state; the U.S. Conference of
Mayors; the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People; and the League of United Latin American
Citizens, among others.
   Commerce Department officials said they are prepared to
defend the guidelines in court. Michael Darby, undersecretary
for economic affairs, said, "The guidelines are designed to
ensure that we have the most accurate census possible and to
prevent manipulation of the census figures for political
purposes." The Census Bureau is part of the Commerce
Department.
   Mr. Zimroth, however, said the guidelines put a higher
premium on maintaining "an orderly transfer of political
power," including the shifts of congressional districts,
rather than on getting an accurate count. He said that under
the guidelines, the Commerce secretary would have the
discretion to reject use of the adjusted census count even if
it were found to be more accurate.
   The motion asks federal Judge Joseph McLaughlin to declare
the guidelines null and void and to declare that a
statistically adjusted census would be constitutional.

   FORFEITURE IS UPHELD for non-obscene materials in an
obscenity case.
   A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., said a lower
court could order the seizure of hundreds of legitimate
magazines and videotapes from a Virginia couple convicted of
racketeering for distributing obscene material.
   The decision, the first in the country to uphold the use
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or
RICO, in an obscenity case, presents novel questions of First
Amendment rights. Attorneys for the couple, Dennis E. and
Barbara A. Pryba, of northern Virginia, said the ruling would
allow inventories from a chain of bookstores to be seized
under RICO if two or more items sold in any one store were
deemed obscene.
   The unanimous appellate ruling, written by Judge Robert F.
Chapman, equated distribution of obscene materials to drug
dealing under the federal racketeering statute, which was
amended in 1984 to help prosecutors combat obscenity. The
seizure of non-obscene materials protected by the First
Amendment was permissible, Judge Chapman wrote, because the
government established a connection between couple's
"ill-gotten gains" and the protected materials.
   "Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and a
convicted racketeer may not launder his dirty money by
investing it in materials that involve protected speech,"
Judge Chapman wrote.
   Mr. and Mrs. Pryba were convicted in 1987 of selling six
obscene magazines and four obscene videotapes. Each sale was
prosecuted as an individual act in furtherance of the
criminal enterprise. Only two such acts need be proved to
obtain a RICO conviction.
   The Prybas' chain of 12 video stores, with total sales of
$2 million in 1986, were shut down as a result, even though
they dealt mostly in general-release videotapes. The total
value of the obscene material at issue in the trial was
$105.30.
   The Prybas' attorney, Paul J. Cambria, an expert in
obscenity issues who has represented Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt, promised an appeal to the Supreme
Court.

   TEXAS SUPREME COURT makes it harder to keep court records
secret.
   A new rule tentatively adopted by the court requires that
a public hearing be held on any proposal to keep settlements
and other case documents confidential.
   Whether court records should be sealed is a controversial
issue in civil damage litigation, especially in
product-liability cases. Corporate defendants contend that
opening settlement agreements and other information to the
public may unfairly expose trade secrets and would impair
their ability to ward off frivolous suits. Plaintiffs'
lawyers, on the other hand, contend that keeping records
secret prevents consumers from learning about hazardous
products and forces duplicative investigations in
product-liability suits.
   Under the new Texas rule, anyone proposing to seal court
records must show that a need exists to protect a
"substantial" interest and that the interest outweighs the
value of the information to public safety and health. This
tougher standard covers all papers filed with a court, but it
doesn't apply to documents attorneys turn up in the
fact-finding process prior to trial. The rule also sets some
limits on when settlements must be made public.
   Texas Supreme Court Judge Nathan Hecht said that he
expects the court to adopt the new rule Monday and that it
probably would take effect Sept. 1. The rule is one of
numerous civil procedure changes the court has been
considering. It previously approved a change that would allow
cameras into civil courtrooms under certain circumstances.
   Dane Harris, president of the Texas Association of
Business, said the rule would cause "needless exposure" of
sensitive and sometimes competitive company information. "We
just feel it's bad public policy," he said.

   LEGISLATORS CRITICIZE Justice Department anti-drug grants.
   A House Government Operations subcommittee has turned up
new problems with the department's state and local grant
program. The panel's investigation has found that about half
the money advertised as intended to spur innovation among
state and local agencies goes to such federal bureaucracies
as the Drug Enforcement Administration. Congress has
appropriated as much as $90 million for the grant program for
the year that began Oct. 1.
   The subcommittee also has questioned the Justice
Department's priorities in making grants. For example, the
government has allocated $2.7 million to assist a
public-service advertising campaign based on the cartoon
crime-fighting dog, "McGruff," according to a House staff
member. In contrast, the department allocated $100,000 for a
new grant category designed to encourage investigation of the
relationship between drug abuse and child prostitution,
teen-age runaways and child pornography.
   "In an age where violent crime has risen for five straight
years we are fighting a war on drugs with cartoon crime dogs.
I think it is time to ask some questions," the subcommittee's
chairman, Rep. Bob Wise (D., W.Va.), said.
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said all of the anti-drug
grant money ultimately benefits states and municipalities,
even if it is routed through federal agencies. "None of our
discretionary money is for the purpose of federal agencies to
enhance their capabilities," said the spokeswoman. As for the
"McGruff" grant, she said that Congress had specifically
earmarked at least $2.7 million for the National Crime
Prevention Council, the private organization that sponsors
the McGruff ads, among other educational messages.
   The subcommittee is scheduled to hold hearings next week
on the preliminary results of its investigation.

   TWO PLEAD GUILTY in scheme involving $4 billion in rigged
securities transactions.
   Jeffrey Feldman, 42, of Skillman, N.J., and Paul Foont,
51, of New York, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the
U.S. through prearranged transactions in U.S. Treasury bills
and other government securities. Prosecutors said those
transactions generated fictitious tax losses of $140 million,
which were passed on to investors in the defendants' business
so that the investors could deduct those amounts on their tax
returns.
   The investments were made in a series of limited
partnerships known as the Cralin partnerships, the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan said. The pleas were entered
last week in federal court.

   OFFICERS OF SOUTHERN AIR TRANSPORT, which has been linked
to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Iran-Contra
affair, lost a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the family
of a co-pilot. A Dade County, Fla., jury found two current
officers and one former officer of the Miami-based company
guilty of gross negligence in the death of Phillip DeCenzo.
The jury awarded his family $10 million, ruling that the
officers failed to alert the co-pilot about an unapproved
control device on a plane, which crashed while taking off
from a Texas Air Force base in 1986. Charles W. Rice, an
attorney for the defendants, said he will try to get the
verdict set aside.

   FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN Dante B. Fascell joins Miami-based
Jorden &amp; Schulte in an "of counsel," non-partnership
capacity. He was formerly associated with Blackwell &amp; Walker,
another Miami law firm. Several other former Blackwell &amp;
Walker attorneys, Edwin F. Russo, S. Alan Stanley and Douglas
Stein, became partners at Jorden &amp; Schulte, which said the
additions will help build its international, corporate and
litigation practices.
