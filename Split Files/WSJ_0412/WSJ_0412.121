   TORONTO -- John Kachmar resigned as president and chief
executive officer of Dickenson Mines Ltd. after management
lost a proxy battle with the gold mining company's major
shareholder, which succeeded in unseating two of Dickenson's
directors.
   Robert McEwen, chairman of Dickenson and president of
Toronto-based Goldcorp Investments Ltd., which owns 70% of
Dickenson's shares, said the company's direction won't change
because of the resignation of Mr. Kachmar, 53 years old.

   The Dickenson board later elected Mr. McEwen to the
additional post of chief executive. David Libby, chief
operating officer, was named to the additional position of
president.
   Mr. Kachmar, who has led Dickenson for the past nine
years, said at the annual meeting that his resignation is
"part of an orderly and normal process." He said he will
remain a Dickenson director, but he wouldn't elaborate on the
reasons for his resignation from the executive posts.
   In the proxy battle, two of Dickenson's directors were
succeeded by Goldcorp nominees. Mr. McEwen said the rival
nominations were made to place more mining engineers on the
Dickenson board.
   James McCartney, a long-term Dickenson director who lost
his seat, said Mr. Kachmar agreed to resign under pressure
from Mr. McEwen. Mr. McCartney, a lawyer, said the change in
top management breaches a covenant of Dickenson's 38 million
Canadian dollar (US$32.8 million) gold loan and will probably
lead to Dickenson's having to refinance the loan on less
favorable terms.
   Mr. McEwen said his views "differ" from Mr. McCartney's,
but he wouldn't elaborate.
