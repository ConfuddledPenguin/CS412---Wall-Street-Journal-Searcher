   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson &amp; Johnson said it will post
a charge of $125 million, reducing first-quarter per-share
earnings 38 cents.
   In the 1989 first quarter, net was $317 million, or 95
cents a share, on sales of $2.45 billion.

   The health-care products concern, which cited adverse
factors in certain Latin American nations for the charge,
didn't offer comment in a prepared statement on how overall
first-quarter results will compare with year-ago figures. A
company spokesman said he wouldn't speculate about such a
comparison.
   The spokesman said Canada and all of Latin America
accounted for $1.2 billion of 1989 sales. The company doesn't
provide a more detailed breakdown. In recent years, the
impact of foreign currency translations has been positive and
negative. Excluding the effects of foreign currency
translations, 1989 sales would have increased 11% rather than
the actual 8.4%, the spokesman said. In 1988, favorable
foreign currency translations boosted sales gains by an
additional 1.7%.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Johnson &amp; Johnson closed at $58.25, up 12.5 cents.
   The company said the charges reflect "severe economic
turmoil, inflation, exorbitantly high and volatile interest
rates and deteriorating business conditions" in certain Latin
American countries. The bulk of the charges include
provisions for writing off and restructuring units in
Argentina and for paying additional interest on the company's
debt in that country. That debt has been liquidated, the
company said.
   The charge also recognizes "the impact of the recent
unprecedented monetary restrictions" imposed by Brazil,
Johnson &amp; Johnson said.
