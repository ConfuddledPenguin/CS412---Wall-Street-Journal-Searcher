   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As soon as the anesthesia
takes effect, the technician sets to work on the patient.
This is surgery most delicate. A falcon's broken beak is
about to be mended.
   The accident happened as the bird ripped into its prey;
its beak hit bone, and cracked. Not long ago, the injury
might have been fatal. But thanks to a veterinary technician
equipped with a tube of epoxy glue and an electric sander,
the proud and stately bird will hunt again.

   In the hungry years before shotguns and oil gushers,
Bedouins on the Arabian peninsula relied on falcons to hunt
food for the nightly campfire. Now, falconry is less a means
of subsistence than a sport for the rich. "Falconing is in
our blood," Mahmoud Farouk says as he extends a
leather-gloved arm to receive his falcon, which had been
treated for worms. "Getting back to the desert keeps us in
touch with our traditions and gives us peace of mind."
   Lots of money is lavished on the sport in these fabulously
wealthy sheikdoms. And as prices for falcons soar well into
the thousands of dollars, owners want the best medical
treatment for their birds. Which is how Cheryl and David
Remple of Laramie, Wyoming, found themselves on the edge of
the desert operating one of the most advanced avian hospitals
in the world.
   Until 1983, the couple had a veterinary practice back home
in Wyoming. Then one day, a phone call came from Dubai,
asking if the pair would set up a falcon hospital for Sheik
Hamdan Maktoum, a member of Dubai's ruling family and an
ardent falconer. Mr. Remple's efforts to save the endangered
peregrine in the U.S. had won high regard in the world of
falconry, even in far-off Dubai.
   "We didn't even know where Dubai was," recalls Ms. Remple,
43, a veterinary technician. But they knew falcons. Her
48-year-old husband, a veterinarian, has been a falconer
since he was 14. On their first date, "David took me to get
pigeons in some verminous old barn," Ms. Remple recalls. Live
pigeons are used to lure back a falcon tempted to fly off to
freedom during a hunt.
   The couple initially agreed to come for six months as "a
lovely lark," says Ms. Remple. When the sheik asked them to
stay on, the combination of a pleasant ambiance and a virtual
blank check for research and clinical practice proved
irresistable.
   During the hunting season, which lasts until late winter,
Dubai Falcon Hospital is bustling. Falconers bring in birds
for checkups before departing for camping parties on the
rolling deserts of Iran and Pakistan, where game is
plentiful. White-robed men, hooded birds perched on their
arms, trade tales of the hunt while waiting for their birds
to be examined.
   As many as 1,000 birds a year are treated here in a series
of low-slung bougainvillea-covered bungalows. Regular
patients have a microchip inserted in a breast muscle. The
chip electronically transmits a code that ensures birds will
be correctly identified and their medical records can be
consulted.
   Cases range from the trivial to the life-threatening.
Masked and gowned, Dr. Remple operates on a falcon suffering
from lead poisoning. Its owner inadvertently had fed the
falcon doves peppered with shot pellets. The bird will be
back on its perch tomorrow, and ready to hunt in a week.
   Meanwhile, Clayton Smith, a veterinary technician
recruited from Montana, pores over selections in the "feather
library." Falcons dive on prey at speeds of up to 200 miles
per hour; a single broken feather can impede performance. So
the hospital stocks hundreds of spares, gathered during
molting season and graded by size. Mr. Smith will insert a
tiny splinter of bamboo into the quill, and glue the new
feather into place.
   Passive on the arm but a terror in the sky, the falcon has
long inspired awe. The Hittites trained falcons as early as
the 13th century B.C. In medieval Europe, a rigid hierarchy
governed the sport. The king flew the imperious peregrine;
the holy-water attendant flew the sparrow hawk.
   Even the Koran speaks of falconry. Eat freely "that which
you have taught the birds and beasts of prey to catch,
training them as Allah has taught you," it says. The sacred
book of the Moslems also instructs falconers to say "In the
name of Allah" when releasing a bird to hunt.
   In the U.S., the sport is so tightly regulated that Dr.
Remple needed a briefcase to carry all the hunting permits.
In Arabia, anyone who can catch or buy a falcon is free to do
so. But the sport is dominated by the well-to-do, whose
hunting parties in the desert can last more than a month. One
sheik is so enamored of the sport that he had a bed made in
the shape of a falcon's foot, Dr. Remple says. One talon
mechanically uncurls to become a staircase to the sleeping
platform; another talon holds a television console.
   Until a few years ago, falconry was a seasonal pastime.
Because the birds couldn't survive the scorching summers,
Bedouins set their falcons free in late winter to join the
migration to cooler climates in Africa. Now, some sportsmen
have airconditioned flypens for their birds.
   Because of the falcon's migratory breeding habits, few
owners learned to tell male from female. The powerfully-built
peregrine, or "shaheen", was assumed to be male. Shaheen, in
fact, is a popular boy's name. The hospital's bulletin board
breaks the news discreetly with a snapshot of a mighty
shaheen labeled with the medical symbol for woman. Beside the
bird is its tiny mate, identified as the male.
   In treating birds, the Remples have had to confront some
strong Islamic traditions. Western falconers adhere to the
practice of painlessly ending the life of a hopelessly ill or
injured bird. Here, such birds are set free "to the will of
Allah." Fortunately, the Remples say, 96% of their patients
had full recoveries last year.
   Late in the day, when the air cools and the desert glare
softens, the Remples drive their falcons to the rim of the
Empty Quarter, a vast sea of sand that extends into the heart
of Arabia. The skyline is studded with minarets. From the
mosques comes the melodic call to sunset prayer.
   Ms. Remple releases her bird's jesses, the little leashes
that secure it to its perch. The bird soars off and turns in
its first slow circle. Not far away, a Bedouin exercising his
racing camel pauses to watch.
   The falcon wheels above a thorny acacia tree. Ms. Remple
hoots to startle the birds perched there. They rise, and the
falcon swoops at breakneck speed toward its prey. It falls on
a small partridge, and the two birds tumble from the sky, a
roiling ball of feathers. It is over in seconds.
   While the falcon gnaws on its kill, Ms. Remple moves in
slowly to re-attach the jesses, offering a morsel of skinned
quail as a reward. This is the falconer's trickiest moment; a
sated bird may fly away, never to be recaptured. According to
local news reports, that was the case recently in an outdoor
market in Saudi Arabia, where a falconer struck a deal to buy
a bird for $1,332. Just as he finished writing the check, the
bird snatched it up in its beak and flew off, leaving buyer
and seller cursing the sky -- and each other.
   But today, there are no such problems. As the couple
bounces back to town in their four-wheel-drive vehicle, the
falcon sits calmly between them in the front seat. The
Remples muse aloud about the difficulties they have
explaining the pleasures of their life to the folks back
home.
   Ms. Remple says her citified parents "just don't see the
attraction of running around in the dust with a skinned quail
in your hand." But, her husband observes, "there's something
really magical about being out by yourself with a bird that
has come to trust you as a partner, that allows you to share
with it what it does naturally, every day, in the wild."
