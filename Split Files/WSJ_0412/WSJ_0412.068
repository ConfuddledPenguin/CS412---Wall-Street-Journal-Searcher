   WASHINGTON -- Lobbying by Federal Reserve Board Governor
Martha Seger has triggered a complaint from the House Banking
Committee and raised embarrassing questions about disarray
within the Fed.
   The controversy involves proposed money-laundering
legislation that would have imposed new record-keeping rules
on banks. Officials of the Fed, the Treasury and the House
Banking Committee were attempting behind the scenes to work
out compromise language. But Ms. Seger, according to
congressional aides, worked independently to promote the
banking industry's point of view and ultimately played a role
in disrupting the settlement process.

   Members of the House Banking Committee have raised
questions about whether Ms. Seger's advocacy in the banks'
behalf was inappropriate, and have asked Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan to look into the matter. Ms. Seger didn't answer
phone calls.
   On March 30, Rep. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.) wrote to
Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez complaining that a
Fed governor whom he didn't identify had "initiated contacts
with bank trade associations." The letter questioned the
authority of a Fed official "to advocate action by a trade
association in legislative matters pending before Congress."
   Mr. Gonzalez, in forwarding the complaint to Mr. Greenspan
on Friday, asked the Fed chairman if the Fed has a policy
governing "the lobbying efforts of any individual Board
member." Mr. Greenspan hasn't responded, but Ms. Seger's
actions were the subject of internal discussions at the Fed
even before Mr. Gonzalez's letter arrived.
   Most government agencies lobby the Congress to some
degree. In the case of the Fed, governors usually coordinate
their contacts with Congress through the Fed's
congressional-liaison office, according to Oliver Ireland,
associate general counsel.
   The congressional complaints bring to the surface concerns
that have long circulated within the Fed about Ms. Seger, and
may further isolate her within the organization. In addition
to dissenting frequently in favor of lower interest rates,
she is often at odds with the Fed staff, travels frequently
and sometimes can't be reached. A former state banking
regulator from Michigan, Ms. Seger was named to a 14-year
term on the Fed by President Reagan in 1984.
   At issue was a proposal by Rep. Torres to force the
Treasury to write stringent new regulations requiring banks
to obtain detailed information when they transfer money by
wire. The Fed governors, including Ms. Seger, opposed the
Torres proposal.
   While the other Fed governors relied on Fed staffers to
try settling the issue, Ms. Seger had conversations with
banking trade groups and, according to Banking Committee
staffers, a heated telephone conversation with Rep. Torres
himself. He declined to comment.
   House staffers say that partly because Rep. Torres was so
annoyed by Ms. Seger's activities, the committee version of
the bill didn't reflect any of the compromise language when
it was unveiled March 22. However, the Fed problems were
eliminated by a Republican-led amendment that passed despite
the opposition of Chairman Gonzalez and Mr. Torres.
   It's unclear whether Ms. Seger initiated the contact with
trade groups or whether she was recruited to the issue, but
there's no disputing her direct involvement.
   "Martha Seger intervened very heavily," said Stephen
Verdier, lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association of
America. "Her basic position was that the whole provision was
lousy."
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the IBAA,
said he called Ms. Seger to enlist her support after learning
of Mr. Torres's proposal from congressional staffers.
   But Mr. Verdier, the IBAA lobbyist who worked on the
issue, said Ms. Seger herself alerted the organization to the
issue earlier in March during the association's convention in
San Francisco. "We'll take information wherever we can get
it," he said.
   "I see nothing improper or inappropriate at all," Mr.
Verdier added. "This is a person who knows the Fed and knows
community banking. It would be irresponsible of her to not
say something if she sees a potential problem in a piece of
legislation."
