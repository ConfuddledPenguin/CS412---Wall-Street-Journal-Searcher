   A spokeswoman said Mr. Nelms stepped down for "personal
reasons," but wouldn't elaborate. Mr. Nelms couldn't be
reached to comment.
   Valley Federal said Scott A. Braly, chief financial
officer, was named interim president and chief executive.
   Valley Federal is among the country's sickest thrifts.
Regulators have ordered it to halt lending and investment
activities, a move that generally is a precursor to
government takeover. It had a loss of $73 million in the nine
months ended Sept. 30 and has announced it will report a $66
million write-down for the fourth quarter, for losses at a
mobile-home subsidiary. Its results for the fourth quarter
and year haven't been released, but it has said it expects to
report tangible capital after the write-down of negative $43
million.
