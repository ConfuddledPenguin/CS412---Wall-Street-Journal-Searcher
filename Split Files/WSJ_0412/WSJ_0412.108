   The UAL Corp. board cut the fees and expenses United
Airlines union advisers would receive in connection with the
unions' proposed $4.38 billion purchase of UAL, according to
documents released yesterday.
   The unions' advisers had been criticized for sharing in
fees totaling $58.7 million for their work on an earlier
labor-management buy-out that collapsed for lack of
financing.

   Under a new, $4 billion offer March 19 negotiated with
Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder, the union
advisers would have received $65 million if they were outbid,
and $25 million even if they couldn't obtain financing a
second time.
   In negotiating a new merger agreement after the unions
sweetened their bid last week, the board got the unions to
reduce those amounts to $40 million for being outbid and $20
million if they can't obtain financing.
