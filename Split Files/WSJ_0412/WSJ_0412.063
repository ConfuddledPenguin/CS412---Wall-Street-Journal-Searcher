   KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysia's merchandise trade surplus
shrank 26% to 679.8 million ringgit ($249 million) in January
from 923.7 million ringgit ($338 million) in the year-earlier
month, the government statistics department said.
   However, the surplus continued to register moderate but
steady improvement from October last year, when the
merchandise trade account dropped into a small deficit.
