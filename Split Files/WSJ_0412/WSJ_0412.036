   The state of Washington's investment board has asked Exxon
Corp. to undergo an independent audit of all its facilities
and operations to determine if they are environmentally
sound.
   The request by the board, which owns or controls about 1.1
million of Exxon's 1.3 billion shares outstanding, is the
latest in a swelling chorus of complaints from major
shareholders about the oil company's recent string of
environmental catastrophes and management's response to them.
The most notable disaster was the 11 million gallon oil spill
caused when the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground off
Alaska in March 1989. Exxon has indicated it expects to
eventually spend at least $2 billion on a cleanup.

   In a letter to Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl, investment
board chairman Joseph A. Dear said the spills and other
environmental problems have "imposed an extraordinary
financial burden" on holders. Mr. Dear said the "value of our
holdings could be jeopardized" if Exxon management doesn't
improve its environmental record. He called for the audit to
be completed by the next Exxon annual meeting.
   The board's action came in response to a proposal by State
Treasurer Dan Grimm. Noting that a lot of Exxon tankers ply
the Puget Sound and other state waters, Mr. Grimm said that
"if Exxon rejects this request {the state} will have no
choice but to consider other approaches to assuring the
safety of oil tanker operations in Washington waters." He
didn't elaborate.
   Exxon couldn't be reached to comment on the board's
proposal.
