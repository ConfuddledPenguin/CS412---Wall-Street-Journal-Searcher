   A mountain of moldy yellow corn rises from a concrete slab
outside the small farm town of Lowden, Iowa. The grain --
12,755 bushels of it -- is under quarantine because it
contains unusually high amounts of deadly aflatoxin.
   The corn is so poisonous that safety officials must don
air masks when they approach it. But though safely guarded
now, the situation wasn't so under control a few weeks ago
when the corn, officials say, might have made it into the
nation's food chain.

   "We were very lucky. Very, very lucky," says W. Michael
Rogers, the federal Food and Drug Administration's district
director in Kansas City, Mo.
   The culprit was another government agency -- the Farmers
Home Administration -- which peddled the poison corn to a
Lowden grain elevator for $9,600. Had the corn gotten into
the food supply, the consequences could have been deadly. One
batch tested from the Lowden stockpile was found to contain
1,600 times the amount considered dangerous for human
consumption.
   The fact that the tainted corn got anywhere near Harlan
Pruess's grain business in Lowden illuminates how difficult
it remains for regulators to police for grain contaminated
with aflatoxin: a naturally occurring carcinogen that broke
out in the Midwest corn crop two years ago.
   Aflatoxin is a poison that can be fatal. Researchers also
have linked chronic low-level exposure of aflatoxin to liver
cancer in humans in regions of Asia and Africa. The poison,
which is excreted by a fungus under certain temperature and
moisture conditions, can also taint peanuts and other crops.
   Iowa officials are furious that the Farmers Home
Administration didn't destroy the crop. "I'm very upset. The
Farmers Home Administration put the public health at risk,"
says Dale M. Cochran, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture.
   Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the Community
Nutrition Institute, a Washington-based food safety advocacy
group, calls the chain of events "unbelievable." He says that
livestock that ate such highly contaminated corn would sicken
or die and that the milk of dairy cattle would also be
contaminated.
   Even though unsafe levels of aflatoxin were discovered in
milled corn and milk after the 1988 outbreak, the government
doesn't require mandatory inspection of corn before
processing -- something that is required of the peanut
industry. So far, the Bush administration has only proposed
mandatory screening of corn bound for the lucrative export
market. Aflatoxin became a hot trade issue after several
nations said they had found the poison in U.S. corn or
corn-derived products.
   Details of the Lowden transaction are sketchy. Mr. Pruess,
the Lowden grain dealer, wouldn't comment on how he came to
acquire the contaminated shipment. An FmHA spokeswoman said
the agency believes it didn't do anything wrong. "We followed
our guidelines" in handling the corn, she said.
   According to several state and federal officials familiar
with the case, however, FmHA officials in Pryor, Okla., took
possession of the corn this winter from at least one farmer
that had filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws.
   The FmHA officials handling the corn apparently were told
it was contaminated. The bill of sale includes a notice that
the crop contained at least 5,000 parts of aflatoxin per
billion. The FDA considers it unsafe for humans to consume
corn that contains more than 20 parts per billion of
aflatoxin. Corn containing more than 300 parts of aflatoxin
per billion is considered dangerous to feed to livestock.
   Since the grain has been stored in Lowden, one sample test
found aflatoxin levels at an astounding 32,000 parts per
billion. And levels are probably rising. "I'm afraid it is
going nuclear on us," says Daryl Frey, director of Iowa's
state agriculture laboratory.
   One of the most puzzling aspects of this transaction is
that the FDA knew the FmHA was sitting on a pile of
contaminated corn and didn't stop it from leaving Oklahoma.
The FDA's Mr. Rogers says that the FmHA was told that the
corn should be destroyed. However, the FmHA spokeswoman said
she "has no evidence" of any warning.
   The FDA restricts interstate shipment of corn that is
contaminated with even a minuscule amount of aflatoxin if it
is intended for human or animal consumption.
   In early March, the FDA quickly tracked down the corn
after a concerned dairy farmer tipped off Oklahoma
agriculture officials that the corn was going to be moved.
The FDA notified Iowa officials, who arrived in Lowden as the
corn was being unloaded from trucks.
   Iowa officials said they feared that Mr. Pruess would
attempt to blend the contaminated corn with uncontaminated
corn to reach legal levels for livestock feed. While such
blending isn't illegal if approved by regulators, accurately
blending such highly contaminated corn would have been
exceptionally difficult, state officials said. Mr. Pruess
declined to comment on what he intended to do with the
contaminated corn.
   The Lowden case has sent a chill through grain experts who
have worried about the practice of using damaged corn in
livestock feed. The level of aflatoxin is much higher than
has ever been detected in U.S. corn and the case raises
questions about whether other grain dealers are acquiring
extremely contaminated grain.
   "This example luckily was caught," said Charles R.
Hurburgh, an Iowa State University grain-quality expert. "Are
there others?"
