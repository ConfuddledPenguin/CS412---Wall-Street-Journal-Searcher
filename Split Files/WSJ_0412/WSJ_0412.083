   PENTAGON CONTRACTORS embroiled in scandals can still get
contracts.
   Fewer than 20% of the large defense firms convicted of
corrupt activities in the past year have been cut off from
any of their lucrative military business. Boeing Co., Grumman
Corp., Raytheon Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Aircraft unit, among others, pleaded guilty to illegal
information-swapping on the condition that prosecutors
recommend they remain eligible for contracts.

   Investigators say the law doesn't permit suspension from
bidding unless a firm refuses to cooperate with prosecutors
and balks at imposing tighter management controls. Thus,
deciding to plead guilty "is strictly a money issue for the
corporations," says Washington defense attorney Joseph
Covington. He says fighting the charges may make the Pentagon
get tougher.
   Worried that industry has been let off too easy, the House
Energy and Judiciary committees demand more data on recent
criminal settlements.
                                                                                                       

   SMALL SUBCONTRACTORS say they'll feel defense cutbacks
first and worst.
   Small high-technology firms that subcontract with major
defense companies expect many of their contracts to be
dropped or canceled as the defense budget is chopped over the
next few years. If a rumored freeze on defense spending
occurs, "small businesses will be hurt first," says Donald
Grigg of the Association of Small Research Engineering and
Technical Services Companies.
   Prime contractors, facing cuts, typically try to keep
business in-house, thus keeping cash flowing through their
companies. When major firms subcontract work, "they're
talking millions or tens of millions of dollars," says Walter
Landauer of Purvis Systems, Westbury, N.Y. Top military
contractors are even cutting out midsized subcontractors, he
says.
                                                                                                       

   WALL STREET retreats from the defense industry.
   Major securities firms are abandoning defense company
research, figuring no one wants to buy stocks in a declining
industry. Dean Witter reassigns its defense analyst to
telecommunications. Merrill Lynch isn't replacing a defense
analyst, who left last year. Those who haven't been
reassigned outright are picking up new responsibilities. "You
can only tell people to sell stocks for so long," says Philip
Friedman of PaineWebber, who picked up telecommunications.
   Wall Street's own woes contribute to the trend, pressuring
firms to direct research at areas that will generate
business. "Clients don't have any interest in this group,"
says William Deatherage, Dean Witter's former defense
analyst. Moreover, Pentagon spending pressures and
Perestroika make a turnaround unlikely for several years.
   The Street continues to cover firms that cater mostly to
the booming commercial aerospace industry, even issuing buy
recommendations on some.
                                                                                                       

   AN ETHICS PROGRAM at General Dynamics Corp., launched in
1985 at Navy prodding, gets 5,000 "communications" a year
from employees, most seeking advice or information; about 10%
lead to investigations. The program, run by 32 directors,
seeks to educate, not "catch people."
                                                                                                       

   LONG-DISTANCE contacts between service personnel and their
children get a boost. Positive Parenting Inc., Phoenix,
markets a kit containing writing tips, colorful paper, and a
special calendar. "When men write to a child, they often
don't know what to write about," says creator Melanie Rahn.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING 40,000 JOBS is the goal of the first
military-to-civilian conversion law, in Washington state,
where over 200,000 jobs are defense-linked. The legislature
allocated $200,000 for an office to help defense-reliant
firms diversify and to retrain workers.
                                                                                                       

   TIGHT MILITARY BUDGETS make for strange bedfellows.
   Worried about having to shoulder the cost of huge
weapons-development projects alone, defense contractors
consider more joint ventures. "We've done a lot of teaming,
and we've put arrangements in place to do more," says James
Cunnane, General Dynamics Corp.'s chief financial officer.
The St. Louis company and neighbor McDonnell Douglas Corp.
team on the Navy's Advanced Tactical Aircraft, designed to
replace the aging A-6.
   Bidding for the Air Force's next-generation Advanced
Tactical Fighter, Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and General
Dynamics take on Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas. The
Army's LH helicopter pits McDonnell Douglas and Textron
Inc.'s Bell division vs. Boeing and United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky unit. Rivals General Motors Corp. and Texas
Instruments Inc. join to build avionics subsystems.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Army Times Publishing Co. says a greater
proportion of military personnel -- 34.5% -- invests in the
stock market, compared with 25.7% for U.S. households. . . .
With scant job placement services, the military academies are
ill-prepared to help the rising number of graduates expected
to quit the military in the wake of declining East-West
tensions. Result: Academy Graduates Executive Search Inc. now
counsels 900 officers, up from 100 five years ago.
