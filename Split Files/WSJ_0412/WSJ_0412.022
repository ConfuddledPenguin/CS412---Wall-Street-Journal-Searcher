   WASHINGTON -- Regulators vastly undervalued Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association's loan portfolio and other
wide-ranging investments to back up their takeover of the
thrift, charged Charles Keating, the chairman of the thrift's
former parent.
   In testimony in Mr. Keating's legal battle to regain
control of Lincoln, attorneys for the Arizona executive
introduced federal documents showing that in an analysis of
how much it would cost to liquidate Lincoln, regulators
slashed the value of loans and investments by as much as 75%.

   The analysis, dated one week after the government seized
Lincoln and placed it in conservatorship last April 14,
suggested Lincoln's assets would be worth only $2.1 billion
if liquidated. Lincoln was carrying the assets on its books
at $5.2 billion.
   "It's absolutely arbitrary," John Lundin, an attorney for
Mr. Keating, said in an interview outside the federal
district courtroom here. "These big write-downs were done
only a week after the takeover."
   But an attorney for the government said the document
wasn't the regulators' final word on the value of Lincoln
assets. "It's just a first cut at the value," said James
Murphy in an interview. He said that regulators normally take
such a quick, broad-brush look at a thrift's value, writing
down assets by using "percentages that in the past they found
to be useful."
   Mr. Murphy said it wasn't until last August that the
regulators, after doing many appraisals of individual assets,
declared Lincoln insolvent and placed it in receivership,
wiping out the ownership interests of Mr. Keating and other
shareholders.
   Nevertheless, Judge Stanley Sporkin seemed surprised by
the big write-downs assumed by the document and asked
yesterday, as he did Tuesday, for testimony from the
government explaining its valuation. "You don't write down
50% of a mortgage portfolio," said Mr. Sporkin, a former
enforcement director at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The liquidation document said nonperforming mortgage
loans, or loans on which interest isn't being paid, totaled
$1.4 billion and assumed losses of $703 million on those
loans. Mr. Keating asserted that Lincoln's entire mortgage
portfolio, aside from $600 million in real estate loans to
Lincoln subsidiaries, totaled $1.4 billion and that only 3%
of that was 60 days late in payments.
   The document also assumed a 75% loss on Lincoln's
investment in certain subsidiaries such as hotels and
insurance companies, as well as stockholdings. Such
investments in so-called service corporations were written
down to $170 million by the regulators from the $700 million
Lincoln used. "It's an impossible number," Mr. Keating, who
is chairman of American Continental Corp., said of the
government's figure.
   Attorneys for Mr. Keating also released a memo showing
regulators were upset with Roger Clark, the executive they
had hired to run Lincoln after taking it over. Though Mr.
Clark was paid a $300,000 annual salary, the memo from the
government's managing agent for Lincoln said Mr. Clark had
"failed to perform" and wasn't taking part in running
Lincoln. Mr. Keating's attorneys said the memo showed that
Lincoln is being managed incompetently by the government.
Lawyers from the government argued the memo is irrelevant to
the case.
   A spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whose
employees are overseeing Lincoln, said Mr. Clark was leaving
his post as Lincoln's chief executive officer today because
his one-year contract hasn't been renewed. Mr. Clark didn't
return calls seeking comment.
