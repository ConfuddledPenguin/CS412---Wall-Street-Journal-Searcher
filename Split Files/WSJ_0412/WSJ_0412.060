   Companies and unions embroiled in labor disputes have
begun attacking each other with a high-caliber weapon: RICO.
   Unfortunately for both sides, it often backfires.

   Designed as a tool to help authorities root out organized
crime in business and labor, the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act allows for civil suits that
permit injured parties to collect triple damages if they can
prove a pattern of racketeering. Though such suits keep
coming, thus far no union or company has carried a huge award
home from a RICO battle. What the two sides have done in such
cases, however, is entangle themselves in expensive court
battles and poison relations even further.
   Earlier this week, strikebound Greyhound Lines Inc. became
the latest company to take a chance on RICO. Desperate to end
the strike violence that has engulfed its struggling
business, the bus line filed a $30 million civil RICO suit
accusing the striking Amalgamated Transit Union of using
"coordinated criminal and extortionate means" to cripple the
company financially.
   The unit of GLI Holding Co. thus joined a small but
growing number of employers that have wheeled out the big
RICO gun. They range from the now-defunct Yellow Bus Co.,
which pressed a $3 million RICO suit against 12 members of a
Washington Teamsters local, to troubled Eastern Airlines,
which in 1988 filed a massive $1.5 billion RICO suit accusing
its machinists' and pilots' unions of attempting to destroy
the company through racketeering, extortion, fraud and
defamation.
   Some legal experts contend that the use of RICO by either
side in a strike situation is a perversion of the law's
intent. "Whatever RICO was designed for, it wasn't designed
to intervene in routine labor disputes," says G. Robert
Blakey, a Notre Dame law professor who helped draft the
original RICO legislation.
   Moreover, says Mr. Blakey, the use of RICO often
complicates rather than solves the plaintiff's labor
problems. "I think there is this popular image that RICO can
do all kinds of things for you, that calling somebody a
racketeer induces a settlement," he says. "That's not true.
More often than not, if you call a person a racketeer, he
digs his heels in."
   Employers have usually been the first to employ RICO in
labor disputes, but unions have often counterattacked with
their own racketeering suits. The United Mine Workers union
has done so twice in recent years. In the long-running
Eastern Airlines dispute, the unions' countersuit accused the
airline of engaging in "fraudulent empire building."
   "What else can you do?" says Earl V. Brown Jr., UMW
associate general counsel. "Do you just sit there and let the
pot call the kettle black or do you go and fight back?"
   Management lawyers contend that RICO is a valid tool when
union members resort to violence in a strike; they say it is
a means to collect damages and deter further unrest.
"Criminal prosecutions don't compensate victims for economic
losses," says a lawyer who represents several coal companies.
"When unions want to engage in criminal activity involving
shootings and beatings, they have to be prepared to face
RICO. There's not a lot of difference between organized crime
and a union when they resort to those tactics."
   Greyhound's RICO suit will be heard in a federal court in
Jacksonville, Fla., site of a March 11 sniping incident in
which seven Greyhound passengers were injured by shrapnel and
debris after a bullet was fired through a bus roof. The
company took the action after five weeks of widespread
violence that included more than 30 shootings of company
buses and terminals and 80 bomb threats. Individual state and
local court orders obtained by the company in 20 cities
failed to stem the attacks and Greyhound officials said that,
through RICO, they hoped to obtain a federal court order
banning strike violence nationwide.
   "We've pretty much exhausted all the other rights and
remedies we have as a private company," says P. Anthony
Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president and chief labor
negotiator. "If they won't stop it because a court orders
them to stop it, then perhaps they will stop it if the court
is imposing liability on them for doing so."
   Although the resolution of the Greyhound case may take
years, the ATU -- like other unions hit with RICO suits --
immediately felt the pressure. Even though the company and
the union were embroiled in a strike, the federal judge
hearing the case allowed the company to immediately begin
taking depositions from ATU officials and examining union
files. "This creates a tremendous distortion of labor law as
it previously existed," says ATU general counsel Earl Putnam.
"It creates a tremendous imbalance against the unions."
   Critics contend that disruption of union strike strategy
-- and ultimately destruction of the bargaining unit -- is
the real intent of RICO suits filed by employers. "What
they're trying to do with RICO is go after the unions
themselves," says Jordan Rossen, general counsel for the
United Auto Workers.
   Lengthy litigation would seem to favor companies, with
their deeper pockets. But that isn't always the case. While
trying to prove that they have been harmed financially, for
instance, some companies have been ordered to open their
books to union lawyers. And, in the case of one San Francisco
electrical concern whose RICO suit was dismissed as
frivolous, the court ordered the company to pay the
defendants' legal bills.
   Even in the cases that are settled, the long-term impact
on labor relations can be devastating, especially where the
employer has accused individual union leaders of being
racketeers. "How can you call someone a racketeer one day and
have a harmonious, problem-solving relationship with him the
next?" asks Mr. Brown of the UMW. "The only person who would
have a thick skin to that kind of accusation would be a real
racketeer."
