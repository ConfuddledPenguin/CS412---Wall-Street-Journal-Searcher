   LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp.'s legal problems mounted as
the Justice Department indicated it would help litigate a
whistle-blower's suit alleging that the company overbilled
the Navy on the F/A-18 strike fighter.
   The government's intervention in the matter, unsealed in
federal court here, is a big lift for Eldon Janssen, the
former Northrop employee who brought the civil action in
1987.

   A Northrop spokesman declined to comment, saying the
company hadn't yet reviewed the court filing. The aerospace
concern's outside counsel, Joe Coyne, would say only that he
was "confident of prevailing."
   Mr. Janssen was a manager of contracts and pricing at the
division where Northrop builds the center and aft fuselage
sections of the F/A-18 for prime contractor McDonnell Douglas
Corp. He was laid off by the company in 1987. That wasn't
long after he first complained to superiors about Northrop's
billing practices, according to Mr. Janssen's lawyer.
   In joining the suit, the government filed an amended
complaint that generally adopted Mr. Janssen's central
allegation that in 1985 Northrop developed but failed to
disclose a cost-saving manufacturing process for the F/A-18's
composite parts. By keeping the method secret, Justice
Department prosecutors and Mr. Janssen assert, the company
was able to pass on inflated expense estimates to the
government from 1985 through 1988.
   The Justice Department said it hasn't yet determined how
much money it would attempt to recover in the case. But Mr.
Janssen's attorney, William Ramsey, put the damages at about
$25 million.
   For a time, the Justice Department also considered
pressing criminal charges against Northrop for its work on
the F/A18, dubbed the Hornet. But a grand jury investigation
was dropped, according to several sources, as part of a
pre-trial settlement last month between the U.S. Attorney's
office here and Northrop on an unrelated test-falsification
case.
   Mr. Janssen's original suit, which is only one of several
False Claims Act cases pending against Northrop on various
projects, also named St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. But
the government, in assuming a lead role in the case, decided
only to go after Northrop. Mr. Ramsey said in an interview
that he agreed with the Justice Department's decision because
it has become clear that McDonnell Douglas was totally
unaware of the manufacturing advance Northrop had devised.
   In fact, Mr. Ramsey maintained, the Northrop division in
Ventura, Calif., that came up with the invention didn't even
pass it on to its sister division that shared part of the
F/A-18 accord.
   The innovation, an improvement on what is known as the
"rubber bag" process, purportedly made it much easier to form
composite materials into complex shapes. By using reusable
silicon rubber vacuum bags that were much better than
earlier, more rudimentary models, Northrop allegedly was able
to shape and cure the parts for the F/A-18 with less material
and labor.
   "Essentially this is a technology that belonged to the
United States that was patented under Northrop's name," said
Mr. Ramsey, adding that his client will continue to pursue
the patent angle on his own, even though the government has
decided to limit the scope of the False Claims Act case to
the charges of overbilling.
   Under the False Claims Act, private citizens file lawsuits
alleging fraud against the government. The Justice Department
has the right to take control of such cases, but the private
plaintiff collects as much as 25% of any award recovered.
   With sales of $629 million last year, the F/A-18 is
Northrop's second-biggest program, after the B-2 Stealth
bomber.
