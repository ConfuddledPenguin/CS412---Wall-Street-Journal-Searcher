   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- East Germany needs annual
growth rates of 8.5% if the production gap between the two
German states is to be closed by the year 2000, the East
Berlin Institute for International Politics and Economics
said.
   The economic research institute said in a report that the
8.5% growth in the gross national product also would be
necessary to keep unemployment rates in East Germany from
rising too sharply.

   If the East German economy grows at a rate of only 5%, the
institute said, then this will mean a loss of about 1.5
million jobs by 1995 and a loss of 2.6 million jobs by 2000,
the institute said. The growth rates will depend to a large
degree on the strength of capital investments.
