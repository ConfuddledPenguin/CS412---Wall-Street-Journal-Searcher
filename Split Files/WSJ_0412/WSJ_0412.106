   Saudi Arabia made another discovery of high-quality crude
oil, strengthening its role as the world's largest exporter
of petroleum.
   In a statement released in the Saudi capital of Riyadh and
in Washington, the kingdom's Petroleum Ministry announced the
new exploratory well was tested at a rate of 2,800 barrels a
day. Though not huge by Middle East standards, the flow is
respectable and marks a new find for the area southeast of
Riyadh. Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, called it a new
field.

   But the well has significance beyond that. For one thing,
in recent interviews, Saudi oil officials have indicated that
they are looking into the possibility that several recent
discoveries in that same region eventually may prove to be
one giant field. If so, such a field could rival in size the
Saudi's Ghawar field, the world's largest.
   Whether that's the case or not, these finds, which are
well away from the original Aramco concessions in the main
oil province of eastern Saudi Arabia, are important because
they are turning up light, low-sulfur crudes that are
relatively scarce in the Middle East. These so-called "sweet"
crudes are much in demand because they yield more of
preferred fuels such as gasoline and also because they
pollute less than the higher-sulfur grades such as Arab
Heavy.
   Much of the current world oil glut is due to a growing
surplus of so-called "sour" crudes, those that have a high
sulfur content and generally are more dense. As a result,
there has been a widening spread between the prices that
refiners will pay for the sweet and sour crudes. Sellers are
discounting sour crudes as much as $4 or $5 a barrel below
the prices of sweet crudes.
   This has meant a stepped-up search by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, particularly
those in the Middle East, for more of the higher-quality
types of oil. And Saudi Arabian Oil Co. -- or Saudi Aramco,
the national oil company -- has made recent strikes of
high-quality crudes in the Dilam, Al-Hawtah and Raghib
regions.
   All these are south to southeast of Riyadh and in the same
general vicinity. The latest find lies east of Al-Hawtah.
   The new discovery well, the Naeem-1, produced oil and
natural gas from a depth of between 8,843 and 8,965 feet. The
Saudis reported that production was through a half-inch
opening and that the well also produced 600,000 cubic feet of
gas a day.
   According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, the
crude oil had a gravity of 42.4 degrees API. This is a
commonly used American Petroleum Institute measurement of
density; the higher the gravity, the lighter the crude. Arab
Berri, the highest-quality Saudi crude, currently produced in
relatively minimal quantities, has a gravity of 39 degrees.
   Saudi Arabia has a pressing need to increase oil revenue,
but is constrained in the amount of oil it can produce
because of its OPEC quota. However, Saudi officials have
noted that they could get premium prices for any sweet crudes
they could find and export. One estimate by the Petroleum
Ministry is that the higher-quality crudes could raise Saudi
Arabia's oil revenue an average of between $1 and $2 a
barrel.
