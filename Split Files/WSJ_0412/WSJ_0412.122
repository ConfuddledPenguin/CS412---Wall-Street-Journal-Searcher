   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp., anticipating a
big speed-up in sales of sick savings and loans, received
authorization to borrow up to $45.3 billion in working
capital from the Treasury this quarter.
   The savings-and-loan bailout agency has said it plans to
sell or liquidate 141 thrifts in the second quarter. It
requires the cash to manage bad investments that buyers of
sick thrifts don't take over, and also to pay off depositors
at liquidated thrifts.

   The working capital is to be repaid with revenue from
selling the bad investments of insolvent savings and loans.
The borrowing is expected to add to the total cost of the
bailout only the amount of interest the agency must pay on
the Treasury bonds, but that could total $28 billion over 30
years, according to government estimates.
   In the first quarter, the agency received authority from
its oversight board to spend $11 billion of the temporary
capital. Most of that cash wasn't spent, as sales of problem
thrifts slowed.
