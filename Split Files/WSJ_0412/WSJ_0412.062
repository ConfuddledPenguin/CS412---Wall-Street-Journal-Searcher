   I was born and raised in Waldenburg, a city about 30 miles
south of Lignitz, the town featured in your March 9 page-one
article. When the war was over, the Russians and Poles came,
killing many of the Germans living there and deporting the
rest of us in cattle cars. During the fall of 1989, I had the
opportunity to go back to my hometown. The decay you so
eloquently describe was everywhere. My parents' house was
only a shadow of its appearance in 1945. A friendly, elderly
Pole showed me around, and he seemed to remember what the
area had looked like when the new masters took over. Clearly,
Germany's loss has not been Poland's gain.
   I now live in this country, and I do not wish to tell the
Germans or the Poles how to settle their differences.
However, not all the injustices in the world were perpetrated
by the Germans, and settling scores by taking land from the
vanquished and expelling the inhabitants of those lands does
not appear to be a solid foundation for peace. I hope a
lasting settlement of these thorny disputes can be reached
within a peaceful Europe.
