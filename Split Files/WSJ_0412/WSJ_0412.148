   The widely monitored Nikkei average of Japanese share
prices finished lower in moderate trading yesterday, as
index-linked selling and profit-taking during the afternoon
session in Tokyo absorbed earlier gains, traders said.
   Despite the losses on the Nikkei index, however, rising
issues managed to outnumber decliners.

   The index of 225 selected issues fell 184.40 points to
close at 29440.28.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index was
down 50.55 points to 29389.73.
   Following Tuesday's 773.25-point loss, the Nikkei rose
more than 300 points on bargain hunting in yesterday's
morning session, hovering around the 30000 level through the
session. Prices of many stocks turned downward in the
afternoon, however, as stock-index futures began to decline,
reflecting investors' uncertainty about the yen's direction,
traders said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million
shares, down from 566 million shares Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers 515 to 418, while 157
issues remained unchanged.
   Gainers were spread over selected sectors, such as
pharmaceuticals, electrical parts makers and textiles.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 43.03 points Tuesday, was down 0.94
point to close at 2185.30.
   The second section index, which gained 21.73 points
Tuesday, was up 13.66 points, or 0.39%, to close at 3533.62.
Volume in the second section was estimated at nine million
shares, the same as Tuesday's.
   Sentiment surrounding the yen's direction and its
stock-market implications remains somewhat nervous, said J.
Graham Biggart, head of futures and options at Schroder
Securities (Japan) Ltd. "But there has been quite reasonable
buying; I wouldn't get too worried at the moment."
   Observers said that traders also tried to hold the Nikkei
and Topix futures at high levels, but that buying there
couldn't be sustained because of weakened sentiments on the
yen's direction.
   Given the uncertainty on the yen, many investors have
turned to a defensive strategy: playing pharmaceuticals,
which move independently.
   "Drug stocks are shielded from both rising interest rates
and the weaker yen," said John Wilson, in charge of research
in pharmaceuticals and textiles at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
Mr. Wilson said that most pharmaceutical companies sell only
in a domestic market, disregarding the yen's exchange rate.
   Moreover, many of these companies are actually receiving
interest, so they benefit from higher interest rates, he
said.
   Because the stocks move independent of price trends, they
also are shielded from the economic slowdown that could
result from interest-rate conditions, Mr. Wilson said.
   He recommends the increasingly popular Sankyo and Chugai
Pharmaceutical, as well as Nippon Shinyaku.
   Chugai shares added 30 yen to 2,100 yen ($13.25), while
Sankyo slipped 10 yen to 2,600. Green Cross advanced 80 yen
to 1,830, Kaken Pharmaceutical gained 90 yen to 1,940 and Ono
Pharmaceutical surged 280 yen to 5,750.
   High-tech electricals were mixed, as Pioneer added 50 yen
to 6,200 and TDK grew 70 yen to 6,670, but Fanuc lost 80 yen
to 7,220 and Kyocera was down 60 yen to 7,660.
   Textiles, such as Kanebo, up 15 yen to 670 and Kurabo, up
41 yen to 750, were gainers.
   In Paris, French share prices climbed to a another record
on renewed demand from Japanese investors and market makers
in London.
   The CAC 40 Index jumped 27.72 points, or more than 1.3%,
to 2103.10, surpassing the market's previous record on Monday
of 2083.90. Trading was moderate, with the strongest demand
focused on blue chips. One broker noted the index is up
almost 10% since the end of March.
   Brokers said the session began on a lackluster note with
profit-taking sending the index down. The drop quickly
attracted interest from London market makers, who are thought
to be short some leading issues after the French market's
slump at the beginning of the year.
   Dealers also suggested Japanese investors are moving their
positions out of West Germany and into France, where the
possibility of a near-term interest-rate cut is higher as the
economy appears poised for long-lasting improvements and the
outlook for corporate profits is considered bright.
   Holding company Cerus was among the day's top gainers,
jumping 19.50 francs ($3.47) to 424.50 francs ($75.45) in
active trading. One trader noted that there had been
unconfirmed newspaper reports Cerus, headed by Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti, might be close to selling its
15% stake in Societe Generale de Belgique.
   Peugeot, which is scheduled to report its 1989 earnings
next week, continued its rise, adding 10 francs to close at
914. Tire group Michelin gained 6.10 francs to 144.90.
   Among leading blue chips, food group BSN rose four francs
to 842 and CGE climbed 10 to 629. Travel and leisure group
Club Med advanced 30 to 710 while LaFarge Coppee followed
through on its previous rally with a gain of 11.50 to 438.
   Oil issues were hit by profit-taking after substantial
gains earlier in the week. Elf Aquitaine eased 12 francs to
665 and Total CFP slipped nine francs to 667.
   In Frankfurt, West German share prices closed lower in
thin trading, as a modest rally early in the session was
snuffed out by a lack of follow-up orders.
   The German Stock Index dropped 4.74 points to end at
1893.77, the sixth consecutive decline. The DAX had moved as
high as 1907.89 early in the day before trailing off.
   The major blue-chip shares declined with the market.
Daimler-Benz edged four marks lower to 917 marks ($547.30),
Deutsche Bank dropped 3.50 marks to 784.50 marks and Siemens
eased 2.40 marks to 770.10.
   In the electrical sector, Nixdorf shares shot up 4.50
marks to 357.50 following news Tuesday that the Federal
Cartel Office in Bonn said it wouldn't block the proposed
merger with Siemens. AEG dropped six marks to 316.
   London shares closed mixed after a session described by
dealers as "desperately quiet" ahead of the extended Easter
holiday weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
two points lower at 2215.5, a touch higher than its intraday
low of 2211.9 reached around midafternoon. The index hit an
intraday high of 2219.9 just after official trading began.
   Meanwhile, the narrower 30-share index ended up 0.8 point
at 1733.3. Volume was 311.7 million shares, compared with
turnover of 367.6 million Tuesday.
   Dealers said the market's attention will be turned today
to the release of British retail price index data for March.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices ended lower in Zurich,
Stockholm and Milan, and were mixed in Brussels and
Amsterdam.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, shares closed lower in
Sydney and Wellington and were higher in Manila, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul.
