   Wang Laboratories Inc., Lowell, Mass., said that, as part
of a continuing effort to pare debt, it agreed to sell its
stock quotation service to a new unit of New York-based
Infotechnology Inc., which owns 47% of Financial News Network
and owns United Press International. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The computer maker said it will take a book loss of less
than $10 million in connection with the sale of its Wang
Financial Information Services Corp. subsidiary. Wang
previously said it expects to report a loss for its third
quarter ended March 31, because of continuing slow sales.

   Wang has said that after completion of the sale of the
unit and previously announced agreements to sell its
international lease financing business and InteCom
subsidiary, its debt will have been reduced to less than $93
million. Last August, Wang's debt was $575 million, and heavy
interest costs in part forced management changes, layoffs and
the sale of "non-strategic assets" to raise cash.
