   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
credit ratings on U.S. companies four times more often than
it upgraded them during the first quarter.
   The credit-rating service issued lowered marks on some $75
billion of debt held by 95 corporations in the quarter,
citing such factors as declining real-estate values and the
rising debt obligations of many speculative-grade companies.
Moody's said 23 companies with $26 billion of debt were given
improved ratings in the same period.

   Financial-services concerns such as banks, thrifts and
securities firms had the sharpest declines in credit ratings,
Moody's said, with 43 companies receiving lower marks.
   The rating service said the current rate of downgrades is
unlikely to slow much this year.
