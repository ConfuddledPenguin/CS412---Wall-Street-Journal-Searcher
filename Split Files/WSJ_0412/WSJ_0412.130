   CHICAGO -- United Airlines said it is decreasing its
cheapest, most-restricted fares between some Northeast cities
and California by an average of 15% for travel from May 1
through June 11.
   The UAL Corp. unit said the move is an attempt to spark
transcontinental traffic during a typically slow travel
period between the Easter and Passover holidays and summer.

   It's unclear whether the move will spread to other markets
but it appears to be a limited pricing move. "It sounds
pretty isolated," said Robert Decker, an airlines analyst at
Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. Other carriers are expected to
match the action.
   United said the new round-trip fare levels will be $358
for off-peak travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday,
and $398 for peak travel during the rest of the week. The
move represents a cut of $60 to $70 from current fares.
   Ticket restrictions are tight, requiring a Saturday night
stay and ticket purchase 14 days before travel and 24 hours
after making a reservation. Also, the fares are
nonrefundable.
