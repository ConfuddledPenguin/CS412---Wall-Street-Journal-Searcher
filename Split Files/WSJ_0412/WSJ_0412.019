   The Berrigan brothers may be the latest beneficiaries of
the lull in the Cold War. Daniel and Philip and six others
broke into a General Electric plant in 1980 to bang dents
into nuclear warhead nose cones and spill human blood. At
their sentencing this week, they said they might repeat their
activities. Despite original sentences of up to 10 years,
local Pennsylvania Judge James Buckingham decided not to send
them back to jail, saying, "We are all concerned about
nuclear war." Daniel Berrigan served a total of five days.
