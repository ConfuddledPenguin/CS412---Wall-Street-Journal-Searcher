   Siliconix Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., said it filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code, partly because of an unfavorable verdict in a patent
infringement suit.
   A federal judge ruled earlier this week that Siliconix, a
maker of semiconductor products, had infringed on patents
relating to certain advanced power transistor technology held
by International Rectifier Corp. Damages and penalties
haven't been determined yet. The lawsuit has been pending for
four years.

   Siliconix also said it is currently in technical default
of certain lending agreements with its banks, which include
First Interstate Bancorp. In 1989, Siliconix had a net loss
of $30 million on sales of $122.5 million.
   The company didn't disclose its assets or debts, and
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
   Richard E. Lee, the company's chairman, said he expects
Siliconix to "continue business as usual."
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Siliconix closed at
62.5 cents, down $1.25.
