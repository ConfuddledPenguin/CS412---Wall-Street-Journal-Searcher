   The French economy, shaking off its reputation for being
unpredictable and inflationary, won a glowing assessment in
the latest report by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
   France has "surpassed expectations on many fronts," the
Paris-based economic institution said. "The French economy
could thus outperform the average of the other countries in
the OECD on both the inflation and growth fronts for the
first time since 1970." The OECD consists of the world's 24
major industrial economies.

   The OECD's accolade coincides with changing perceptions in
the investment community. Increasingly, France is seen to
offer a measure of both sizzle and stability: It can expect
healthy growth in the early 1990s but without succumbing to
the inflation virus that's currently sapping Britain and
threatening West Germany.
   The French economy should grow at a rate of 3.1% in 1990,
and 2.8% in 1991, with inflation kept well under control, the
report said. Moreover, this follows two years of growth of
greater than 3%. Political stability also is a hallmark these
days, with legislative elections not scheduled until 1993 and
a presidential vote until 1995.
   Among the major European economies, France looks
particularly strong. Britain is bracing for its inflation
rate to surge above 9% this spring, amid anemic growth
outside the oil sector. West Germany, Europe's economic
engine and its historic monetary anchor, faces disruptions
and considerable inflationary pressure from the pending
economic and monetary union with East Germany.
   According to the OECD, the recent international confidence
in the French franc stems largely from its participation in
the European Monetary System, which links currencies together
within set exchange-rate bands.
   Not everything is perfect in Paris. The OECD and
independent economists point to the continuing aftershocks
from a poor investment record over the past two decades,
which they say prevents French industry from taking full
advantage of new growth opportunities around Europe.
   Another danger sign is the shortage of skilled labor
despite relatively high unemployment of 9.4%. The OECD noted
that France created 500,000 jobs in the past two years, but
it worries that the increase will slow because of a lack of
qualified workers.
   For the future, the OECD recommended reform in tax and
social benefits policy. French social insurance costs eat up
the highest percentage of any major industrial country, 44%
of GNP compared with 30% in the United States and 37% in
Germany. Pension and health costs have risen particularly
fast in France.
