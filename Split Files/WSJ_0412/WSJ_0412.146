   PITTSBURGH -- A veteran Eastman Kodak watcher named Eugene
Glazer had a nightmare the other night. He dreamed that Kodak
was ordered to pay $3 billion in damages to settle the patent
case won by Polaroid in 1985.
   Mr. Glazer, a Dean Witter analyst, has reason to toss and
turn. After two years of keeping a "neutral to negative"
rating on Kodak, he recently took a warmer view of the shares
of the Rochester, N.Y., marketer of photographic, chemical
and drug products.

   Most of his colleagues disagree. They see the Polaroid
legal situation as sufficient reason to avoid the stock for
now. A decision on damages is expected soon, as a judge
appears nearly ready to impose an award if a settlement isn't
reached. And the Street consensus is that Kodak will have to
pay between $1 billion and $2 billion for infringing on
Polaroid's instant-photography patents.
   Other negatives loom: Revenue remains sluggish in the face
of weak foreign currencies. A lackluster economy is dragging
down Kodak's chemical division, which posted excellent
results last year. The information segment, which includes
copiers and electronic printers, was plagued by high costs
and production problems last year, and still isn't generating
as much revenue as expected. Savings from the company's
current pruning programs, which some believe are too little,
too late, won't come until the second half.
   David Nelson, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, figures
that Kodak's stock could fall an additional 10% to 15%. "We
think Kodak is a cheap stock but there's no reason to think
it will be less cheap in the immediate future," he says. "A
trust officer at a bank would have a tough sell pushing
investment in Kodak, particularly in advance of the damage
settlement."
   The only thing that would change his outlook is
surprisingly strong earnings -- and that isn't in the cards,
Mr. Nelson asserts. Wall Street, too, is doubtful. The
consensus forecast for full-year earnings has been falling.
Now, most analysts predict Kodak will earn less than $4 a
share, down from the $4.30 they were estimating last fall.
Profit for 1989 was $3.32 a share before $875 million in
restructuring charges.
   So why is Mr. Glazer so optimistic? Based on his profit
estimate for this year, Kodak trades at a 35% discount from
the price-earnings ratios of the market's industrial stocks
in general -- mainly because, in his view, it already
reflects all the bad news.
   At yesterday's close of 39 7/8 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, Kodak is near its 52-week low of 36
7/8. Mr. Glazer believes Kodak could trade at 49 a share
within a year in a flat stock market, based on estimated 1990
earnings of $4.10 a share.
   He sees good news in Kodak's fundamental operations.
Cost-cutting programs should yield savings soon, he says,
raising the potential for an upside earnings surprise in
subsequent quarters. He estimates savings at $350 million in
1990, and $450 million to $500 million annually -- about $1 a
share -- in years beyond.
   Moreover, pricing pressures on the crucial film and
photographic paper businesses seem to have eased. Kodak,
which has been unable to put through price increases in
recent years because of tough competition, recently raised
prices as much as 5% on amateur film. And rivals have seemed
willing to follow Kodak's lead.
   There are a lot of "ifs" in Mr. Glazer's scenario. For one
thing, he doesn't factor in any changes in the currency. He
also assumes the economy will slow but won't plunge into a
recession.
   As for the black cloud of Polaroid, he says, Wall Street
already has discounted Kodak stock to account for a $1
billion to $2 billion award.
   But Wall Street seems to feel that investors are braced
for an award of as much as $2 billion. In fact, if the
settlement is below $2 billion, Kodak's stock could rise, Mr.
Glazer says. (Of course, he concedes, Kodak's stock could
drop $2 a share for every $1 billion above a $2 billion
determination.)
   Once the damages are determined, he thinks other
contrarians, who have sat on the sidelines for fear of a huge
settlement, will begin buying Kodak stock. Particularly prime
for investment are institutional investors, which hold only
48% of Kodak stock compared with a more typical 65% to 70%
for large-company stocks.
   "The only thing holding {the institutions} out is the fear
of an upside surprise on damages," he contends. "It's an
ideal contrarian type of stock."
