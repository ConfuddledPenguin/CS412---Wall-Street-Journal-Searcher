   LOS ANGELES -- Security Pacific Corp. said its
first-quarter net income rose 5% to $188.4 million, or $1.54
a share.
   The results were marred by a jump in bad loans and in
foreclosed real estate and were below Wall Street estimates.
They touched off an early mild decline in Security Pacific's
stock, which already had been trading at depressed levels
relative to its earnings, and highlighted the challenge faced
by the company's new chief executive officer, Robert Smith,
as he attempts to boost earnings and market value, both of
which are believed to be crucial to his long-term strategy
for the bank.

   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Security
Pacific closed at $35.875, unchanged. The quarterly results
indicate a price-to-earnings multiple of about 6; J.P. Morgan
&amp; Co.'s multiple, by comparison, is about 8.
   In the year-earlier period, Security Pacific earned $179.3
million, also $1.54 a share. The company had 116.5 million
shares outstanding in the latest quarter, up from 112.7
million a year earlier.
   Most analysts had projected per-share earnings for the
period of between $1.60 and $1.65. But Security Pacific's
nonperforming loans edged up to $1.7 billion from $1.6
billion a year earlier, mainly because of troubled loans in
Australia and the United Kingdom. Its level of repossessed
real estate jumped 72%, to $542 million from $315 million a
year ago. Net credit losses, excluding developing-country
debt, totaled $113.9 million, 22% above a year-earlier $93.6
million. The company's reserve for credit losses stood at
$1.2 billion at March 31, roughly the same as last year's
reserve.
   The company also said its net interest margin -- the
difference between what it pays for funds and receives on its
loans -- slipped to 3.95% from a year-earlier 4.21%.
   John Kooken, vice chairman and chief financial officer,
said that $40 million of the credit losses came from the
devastated Arizona real estate market. Security Pacific had a
loss of $176 million in its Arizona operations last year, but
despite the continuing bleeding in the first quarter, Mr.
Kooken said the bank still expects its Arizona losses for all
of 1990 to be "substantially below" 1989's levels.
   He also said that the swollen repossessed property
portfolio reflected problems in California and overseas, as
well as in Arizona. But he said the bank foresees no imminent
swoon in California real estate; such a development is much
feared in the banking industry because many lenders have
heavy exposure there and because California's lengthy real
estate boom has left it one of the few healthy markets in the
country.
