   STOCKHOLM -- The deficit on Sweden's current account
balance widened to 3.1 billion kronor ($507.5 million) in
February from a deficit of 0.3 billion kronor ($49 million)
in the like month a year earlier, the Riksbank, Sweden's
central bank, said.
   The deficit on the current account, which includes traded
items, services and transfers, was higher than the 2.4
billion-krona deficit recorded in January, the Riksbank said.
