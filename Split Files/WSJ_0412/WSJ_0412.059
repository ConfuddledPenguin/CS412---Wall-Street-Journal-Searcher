   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Live Entertainment Inc. named Wayne H.
Patterson as chairman and chief executive officer, filling
the posts formerly held by Jose Menendez, slain last August
along with his wife, Kitty.
   Mr. Patterson, 43 years old, served more than three years
at the helm of Pace Membership Warehouse Inc., and during his
tenure sales and profits of the discount retailer more than
doubled. Last November, Pace was sold for $323 million to K
mart Corp., and since then, Mr. Patterson has served as K
mart's executive vice president, specialty retailing. Prior
to his work at Pace, Mr. Patterson spent more than 15 years
with the accounting firm of Touche, Ross &amp; Co.

   Mr. Patterson's appointment brings a captain to a company
that has drifted without a permanent chairman and chief
executive since Mr. Menendez's death. "My sense is that a
large part of my job will be leadership, being visible both
internally and externally, and letting people know there's a
full-time chairman," said Mr. Patterson, who was visiting
Live's Lieberman Enterprises Inc. unit in Minneapolis
yesterday.
   Live distributes videocassettes and sells entertainment
software.
   Since the homicides, Mr. Menendez's former posts have been
held on an interim basis by Peter M. Hoffman, president and
chief executive of Carolco Pictures Inc., the entertainment
concern that holds a 49% stake in Live.
   The appointment of Mr. Patterson also comes at a time when
the cloud of controversy surrounding Live following the
homicides appears to have lifted.
   Last month, police arrested the Menendez couple's two
sons, Lyle, 22, and Erik, 19, and charged them with murdering
their parents to gain access to the couple's $14 million
estate. Both sons have pleaded innocent. The arrests quieted
speculation that the brutal shotgun slayings might be linked
to organized crime. Live had purchased two companies from
individuals who have been identified by law-enforcement
authorities as involved in organized crime.
   In the week following the arrests, Live released the
findings of an internal investigation, which found "no
credible information" that would link the company's
operations to the slayings. The report by the law firm Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler also found "no evidence of
criminal activity" at Live.
   Mr. Patterson said he read the 220-page report and made
inquiries to people familiar with Live as part of his "due
diligence" review, and added, "I am convinced that the
company has quality directors and quality people." As for the
speculation of organized crime connections, he said "there
was no basis for concern."
   Since the arrest of the Menendez sons, Live's stock price
has rebounded. In the months following the killings, the
price sank to $13.25, but it has since risen to around $20 a
share. Yesterday, Live shares rose 50 cents to close at
$21.25 in national over-the-counter trading.
   Mr. Patterson declined to lay out his specific plans for
Live, saying he first wants "to really go through the
business and understand it in a definitive way." But he did
say of the company's existing operations that "it's likely
we're going to stay in those businesses and let them grow."
   He added that Live has "progressed admirably in Jose's
absence," something he attributes to the "can-do attitude" of
employees.
