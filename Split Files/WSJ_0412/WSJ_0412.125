   Kimberly-Clark Corp. said its net income rose 14% for the

$103.1 million, or $1.28 a share, last year.

   Kimberly-Clark said revenue increases in its North
American consumer product lines, coupled with decreases in
manufacturing costs and marketing expenses, contributed to
the improvement. The company said North American newsprint
markets, however, continue to be weak and its two newprint
facilities turned in small operating losses for the period.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Kimberly-Clark closed at $67.875 a share, up $1.375.
