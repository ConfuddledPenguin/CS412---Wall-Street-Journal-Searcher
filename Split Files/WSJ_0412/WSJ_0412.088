   BONN -- East Germany's first democratically elected
government is shaping up as a more formidable negotiating
partner than West Germans expected.
   In the wake of last month's election, East Germans
appeared eager to unify with their Western cousins. They
still are. But East German enthusiasm for unity is now
tempered with a growing sense that they'll have to guard
their own interests along the way, because nobody else will.

   This realization helped pull together the East's
squabbling political factions, which have now put the final
touches on a ruling coalition. After three weeks of
wrangling, the East Germans last night announced they had
cleared the last hurdles to a "grand coalition" made up of
conservatives, Social Democrats, and a small coalition of
liberal parties.
   The new government is expected to be formally endorsed by
the East German parliament today. Without a legitimate East
German government, there was nobody for the West Germans to
negotiate with over a future monetary union. Similarly, the
so-called two-plus-four talks, involving the two Germanys and
the four victorious wartime allies, the U.S., France, Britain
and the Soviet Union, can now start working on the
international aspects of German unity.
   The strength of East Berlin's negotiating position hinges
on the ability of the East German parties to pull together.
In this regard, the new government seems to be off to a
strong start. East Germany's conservative premier-designate,
Lothar de Maiziere, led negotiations with the center-left
Social Democrats that often seemed snarled over differing
views on the pace and conditions of German unity. The Social
Democrats favor a slow approach, while the conservatives want
utmost speed toward a merger. In the end, the two sides were
able to compromise.
   The Social Democrats, for instance, want to shift
ownership of state-owned companies to workers, while the
Christian Democrats want to sell them to anyone. As a partial
solution, the two sides agreed that the property of East
German citizens should be protected for 10 years, and that
East Germans should have first crack at companies about to be
privatized.
   Forming unified positions on such sensitive topics is
crucial, because it allows the East Germans to speak with one
voice when negotiating with Bonn. Mr. de Maiziere's
conservative alliance got enough votes to build a majority
without the Social Democrats, but it needs a two-thirds
majority in parliament to push through the constitutional
changes necessary to clear the way for unification.
   East Germany's new leaders share many of the same goals as
their West German counterparts, but the government now
emerging has shown it can flex its muscles. Nowhere is this
more visible than in the explosive dispute over the exchange
rate for the East German mark.
   East Germans were jolted last week when the Bonn
government appeared to backtrack on earlier promises of a
generous one-to-one exchange rate for their currency,
favoring instead a West German Bundesbank plan to convert
only 2,000 marks at this rate with the rest exchanged at a
less-favorable two-to-one rate. The West Germans never
promised a sweeping one-to-one conversion, but East Germans
had come to expect it.
   East Germans took to the streets to protest the lower rate
and, in a sharp break with the tone of the election campaign,
aimed their ire specifically at West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. The uproar gave East Berlin a new sense of its own
power, because it showed that East Germans would actively
support its positions, even if they seemed to throw barriers
in the path of early unification.
   The dispute helped the East German parties move toward
compromise. Mr. de Maiziere's willingness to criticize Bonn
-- and even his supporter, Helmut Kohl -- convinced Social
Democrats that the conservatives would fight for East German
interests. Some critics had argued that the conservatives
wouldn't dare contradict their Western patrons.
   The conservatives had not only pledged to work for quick
union with the West, they had also designated a West German
conservative, Elmar Pieroth, to play the key role of
negotiating the merger as economics minister. But in the wake
of the exchange-rate dispute, Mr. Pieroth was dropped to the
rank of economic adviser. The economics ministry will still
go to a conservative, East German Gerhard Pohl, who wants the
one-to-one currency swap to apply to up to 30,000 marks per
person. "An exchange amount of 2,000 marks is no good, it's
much too small," he told West German reporters.
   Meanwhile, Rainer Eppelmann, a peace activist and leader
of the conservative Democratic Awakening Party, is expected
to be East Germany's new defense minister. In this post, he
could significantly influence East-West negotiations over the
role of Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To
underscore the obvious, the East Germans have even changed
the ministry's name -- to the Department of Defense and
Disarmament.
