   A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder, a former
strategist for T. Boone Pickens, disclosed that it holds a
6.6% stake in Pic 'N' Save Corp. and plans to make a bid to
acquire the company.
   The bid has an indicated value of about $447 million,
based on Pic 'N' Save's roughly 35.5 million shares
outstanding. The company, based in Dominguez, Calif., is a
retail chain that buys manufacturers' close-out merchandise
and sells it at deep discounts to customers.

   Girard Partners Limited Partnership said in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that it owns 2,365,100
Pic 'N' Save common shares, including shares bought from Feb.
12 to April 5 for $9.87 to $12.01 a share.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Pic 'N' Save shares
closed at $13.50, up 50 cents. The Girard filing surfaced
after trading ended.
   William M. Jacobs Jr., the retailer's senior vice
president and chief financial officer, answered questions
about the company and its business but declined to comment on
the Girard filing. The company's shares have been active in
recent sessions in the wake of reports that someone was
accumulating the stock.
   In the filing, Girard said it plans to solicit consents
from shareholders to approve a resolution calling for a
five-member board consisting of a majority of Girard
nominees. Pic 'N' Save's board now has eight members.
Officers and directors own less than 5% of the company's
stock.
   The written-consents process is an increasingly popular
mechanism for acquiring management control, similar to a
proxy solicitation, which doesn't require a shareholder
meeting. Girard said its nominees, if elected, would seek
acquisition proposals for a negotiated sale of the company to
the partnership or to another bidder. Girard said it is
initiating discussions with potential lending sources
regarding financing an acquisition.
   Mr. Batchelder left Mr. Pickens's Mesa Limited Partnership
two years ago and formed his own investment firm in La Jolla,
Calif. Last year, Mr. Batchelder advised Los Angeles investor
Marvin Davis in his failed attempts to buy NWA Inc., parent
of Northwest Airlines, and UAL Corp., parent of United
Airlines. The Pic 'N' Save bid apparently is Mr. Batchelder's
first major takeover attempt on his own steam. Mr. Batchelder
didn't return calls from a reporter.
   Pic 'N' Save was founded more than four decades ago in
Southern California, went public in 1971, and in recent years
has expanded into New York, New Jersey, Texas and other
states. Last month, the company reported "disappointing" 1989
results. Net income fell 34% to $30.9 million, or 87 cents a
share, on sales of $475.2 million. The company has 189
stores.
