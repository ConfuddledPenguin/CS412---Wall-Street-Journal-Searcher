   An investor group led by former Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci and the Mellon family proposed that Harsco Corp.
sell off its defense operations and pay a special cash
dividend.
   The group, HC Partners of Washington, D.C., offered to
invest at least $100 million and possibly as much as $200
million in the Camp Hill, Pa., construction, defense and
industrial concern as part of the proposed restructuring. The
additional $100 million, if provided, would be targeted to
accelerate Harsco's world-wide research, development and
marketing efforts, the group said.

   HC Partners, controlled by the Carlyle Group, a merchant
bank partly owned by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, began
accumulating a stake in Harsco last October and now owns
about 1.9 million shares, or approximately 7%. That stake
would increase with the proposed cash infusion. But a
spokesman for the Carlyle Group declined to specify how much
the investors expect to own if the proposal is accepted by
Harsco.
   Harsco declined to comment on the proposal or on whether
its board and management will meet with the investors. Mr.
Carlucci, vice chairman of Carlyle, has requested that a
meeting take place before the annual meeting April 24.
   The investors' plan calls for Harsco to pay a special
dividend of $15 a share. The dividend would be financed
through a combination of borrowing $300 million through
Harsco's existing credit agreements and at least $100 million
from HC Partners.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Harsco closed at $25.50, up 12.5 cents.
   The plan calls for Harsco to get out of its troubled
defense businesses, which include the manufacture of such
military hardware as howitzers, field-artillery support
vehicles and armored earthmovers.
   Although analysts say the plan makes sense because it
would allow Harsco to focus on its more profitable
industrial-services and engineered-products units, they
question whether Harsco could find a buyer for the defense
group.
   "If Harsco would've been able to accomplish that, the
company would've done it already," said David S. Moore,
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York.
   Harsco's defense businesses have been plagued by
production problems at its Marysville, Ohio, plant, where it
builds five-ton trucks for the Army. And the company hasn't
been able to renegotiate prices on some Army contracts, so
production costs have exceeded the sale price.
   Those problems have forced Harsco to take substantial
provisions for losses, pushing fiscal 1989 net income down
63% from the year earlier to $11.4 million, or 43 cents a
share. Sales rose 6% to $1.35 billion.
