   SEATTLE -- Boeing Co., an aircraft maker and defense
contractor, said Maersk Air, an independent Danish airline,
ordered a Boeing 737-500 plane and three 737-300s for about
$127 million. It said Maersk has already taken delivery of 25
Boeing 737s.
   Boeing has received orders for 193 Boeing 737-500s and 951
of the 737-300s since it began production of the aircraft in
1968, a spokeswoman said.
