   DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc. said it is restoring
service to 286 communities in a move the strike-bound bus
company said would increase its passenger service network by
28%.
   The company has been operating with replacement drivers
and union crossovers since March 2, when 9,400 members of the
Amalgamated Transit Union walked off the job in a contract
dispute over wages and workplace issues.

   The unit of GLI Holding Co. said the increase, announced
just before the busy Easter travel weekend, boosts its daily
scheduled service to about 72% of pre-strike levels.
