   A hybrid antibody against acquired immune deficiency
syndrome created by Genentech Inc. has jumped two important
biological hurdles, scientists said.
   The experimental agent succeeded in rallying natural
immunity against the AIDS infection and in reaching the
fetuses of pregnant primates, suggesting a possible approach
for the prevention of AIDS in newborns.

   The findings were reported in the British journal Nature
by Daniel J. Capon, a scientist at Genenetch, a biotechnology
concern based in South San Francisco, Calif., and Randal A.
Byrn, a researcher at New England Deaconess Hospital in
Boston.
   Genentech emphasized that although formal proof of the
biological properties of the experimental therapy, called
CD4-IgG, is encouraging, it doesn't take the place of
clinical trials in AIDS patients, which began last August and
are continuing at several centers nationwide.
   CD4-IgG fuses the human antibody immunoglobulin G to a
copy of the target molecule CD4, which is used by the virus
to infect human cells. This approach lengthens the half-life,
or prolongs its activity in the body, as well as several
other advantages that previously were considered theoretical.
   The researchers also wondered whether this approach could
help rally the body's active immunity against the virus, or
cross the placenta of females to their fetuses. In fact, it
did both, the report says.
   The scientists said CD4-IgG directed certain cells of the
immune system, called "killer cells," to attack and destroy
AIDS-infected cells in the body. The agent spares uninfected
"bystander cells," as researchers had hoped.
   In addition, tests with pregnant rhesus monkeys
demonstrated that CD4-IgG is transported through the placenta
from mother to fetus, in much the same way that natural
immunoglobulin is passed from a woman to her fetus.
   Given the problem of growing numbers of pediatric AIDS
patients infected by their mothers before or during birth,
the finding gives hope that CD4-IgG might lead to a strategy
for prenatal AIDS treatment, the report says.
