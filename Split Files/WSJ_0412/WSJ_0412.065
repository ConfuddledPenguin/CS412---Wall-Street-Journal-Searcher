   I want to commend you for your March 9 editorial "Why the
Fire Sale?" You are quite right in pointing out the
counterproductive nature of U.S. government actions against
the dollar. This irrational policy helps foreigners at the
expense of Americans. In addition to being a bad bargain when
Americans sell assets to foreigners, a cheap dollar makes it
more expensive for U.S. businessmen to invest abroad in such
promising markets as the emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe.
   The main argument in favor of a lower dollar, that it
supposedly helps reduce the foreign trade deficit, does not
stand up under critical examination. A lower dollar means
higher inflation rates, which increase interest costs, which
undermine the competitiveness of the U.S. in the
international marketplace. In contrast, a strong dollar
reduces inflationary pressures and results in lower interest
rates, which have a favorable impact on the operating costs
of the capital-intensive enterprises that account for most
U.S. exports.

   Historical evidence supports the view that a strong dollar
is good for the U.S. trade balance. In the period 1945-1972,
the dollar was the strongest currency in the world, and the
U.S. had the lowest interest rates of any major industrial
country and a highly favorable trade balance.
