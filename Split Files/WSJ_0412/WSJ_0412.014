   I learned recently that the average American spends seven
hours a day watching television. Trying to do my share, I was
flicking my remote control the other day when I lit upon a
hearing before the Joint Economic Committee. The chairman,
Rep. Lee Hamilton, is interrogating Richard Darman, director
of the Office of Management and Budget. He asks Mr. Darman
his opinion of the various ingredients in Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski's proposal for balancing the budget. As Mr.
Hamilton lists each proposal for a tax increase Mr. Darman
looks at it, sniffs it, bites it, and then rejects it,
saying, "Not sufficiently pro-growth."
   That kind of thing can occupy a couch potato for only so
long, so I flick again and find Michael Boskin, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers, explaining to the Senate
Finance Committee that the reason to cut the capital-gains
tax is to promote growth.

   Flick again, and there is John Sununu, the president's
chief of staff, telling Judy Woodruff that the reason some
people want a stronger environmental program than he does is
that they are "anti-growth."
   So I had to find out what has made "growth" the acid test
by which all policies are judged. I turned to holy writ, the
Economic Report of the President, and there it was, on the
first page:
   "The primary economic goal of my Administration is to
achieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economic
growth. Achieving this goal will require action on many
fronts -- but it will permit progress on many more. Growth is
the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of
prosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in need,
and to maintaining America's leadership in the world."
   That is pretty strong stuff. Growth is not just "a" goal
or "an important" goal; it is the "primary" goal. And the
goal is not just a high rate of growth: It is the "highest
possible rate of sustainable growth." And growth is not just
"a" key to a lot of good things: It is "the" key.
   This could all be one grand tautology. "Economic goal"
could be defined so narrowly that it is identical with
economic growth, or "economic growth" could be defined so
broadly that it encompasses all good things. But while
committing tautology may not be an impeachable offense, I
prefer to believe that my president does not indulge in it.
   So it may be worthwhile trying to parse out this paragraph
on the assumption that it means something. If economic policy
can have consequences other than consequences for economic
growth, and if some of these other consequences may be good,
what does it mean to say that the highest possible rate of
economic growth is the "primary" goal? Specifically, does it
mean if Policy A yields more growth and less of some other
good thing than Policy B that Policy A is always to be
chosen?
   That would clearly be an absurd position. Taken literally,
it would mean that the tiniest addition to growth is to be
chosen at the sacrifice of no matter how much of some other
good thing. And the administration does not really mean that.
Following the paragraph I have just quoted, the president
lists the policies he proposes to achieve his goal. The first
is: "Reduce government borrowing by slowing the growth of
Federal spending while economic growth raises revenue until
the budget is balanced, and reduce the national debt
thereafter."
   But if that is a route to more growth, it is not the route
to the highest possible rate of growth. That would involve
not only slowing the growth of federal spending but also
sharply cutting expenditures for Social Security, Medicare,
aid to farmers, defense and other things in order to reduce
the deficit faster and get a bigger budget surplus. I suppose
the administration does not propose that because it is
unwilling to sacrifice some other objectives in order to get
the amount of additional growth that might result from doing
so. When you say that, however, the notion of the primacy of
the goal of the highest possible rate of economic growth
crumbles.
   The proposition that economic growth is "the key" to a lot
of good things, like "uplifting those most in need," is an
attempt to evade the consequences of the fact that there are
valuable objectives other than growth. I used to encounter
this proposition in its most outlandish form in argument
about the defense budget:
   A. A strong economy is the key to national security.
   B. Cutting defense expenditures will make the economy
stronger.
   C. Therefore, cutting defense expenditures is the key to
national security.
   The relevant question is whether devoting certain
resources to increasing economic growth is a more efficient
way of achieving the other objectives -- such as national
security or uplifting the poor -- than devoting the same
resources directly to those purposes. The answer to that will
surely depend on the particular objectives and resources
under consideration. I am sure that in the defense case,
spending more on defense did more for national security than
using the same amount of money to reduce the deficit or cut
taxes would have done. I believe that the same is true of
uplifting the poor and exercising international leadership.
At least, the question needs to be argued and the answer not
taken for granted, as tends to be done.
   I think the administration is saying that when it
encounters a choice between more growth and more of some
other objective it leans in the direction of favoring growth
more than someone else -- Congress or Democrats or previous
administrations. This is a legitimate preference, like
preferring not to eat broccoli. But it is also legitimate to
have a different preference. The quality of discussion would
be improved if the administration would clarify its choices.
   For example, the administration might say about the
capital-gains tax: "We recognize that a preferential rate for
capital gains violates the valuable principle of equity in
taxation, but we believe that the resulting gain in economic
growth is worth that sacrifice of principle." Or about the
environment it might say: "We recognize that the
environmental measures that others propose would make life
less short and nasty, but we prefer to sacrifice that gain
for the sake of more rapid economic growth." Then we could
talk about the quantities and values involved, instead of
dividing up into pro-growth and anti-growth factions.
   I suppose that anyone who reads between my lines can see
that I do not share the high priority the administration
asserts for rapid economic growth as a goal of government
policy. There are two reasons for that.
   First, as I look around at the American scene I cannot
believe that making gross national product grow faster, and
making the consumption of ordinary Americans grow faster,
which is where most of the GNP goes, is a very high
objective.
   Between 1970 and 1988 real GNP increased by two-thirds and
real per-capita consumption increased by 45%. But the
proportion of the population in poverty, by official
measures, did not decline. The underclass and the homeless
are, if not more numerous, more intrusive in our
consciousness and consciences. The quality of education is a
great concern. So are drugs and crime. Meanwhile we are
falling all over ourselves to cut the defense budget, on the
ground of economic necessity.
   Second, if the great majority of the American people feel
that improving their living standards and those of their
children is a high-priority objective, they have the means to
do much to achieve that objective without further involvement
of the federal government. They can work harder, save more
and get their children to study more.
   I do not agree with those who think that the government
should have no role in affecting economic growth. But the
objectives that people have less ability to achieve for
themselves deserve a higher priority in the government's
attention. This includes defense, helping to ensure
international political stability, environmental protection,
crime prevention, maintenance of equal treatment before the
law, provision of infrastructure, and provision of
opportunity for the very poor to lift themselves out of
poverty.
   In my opinion, we are too rich to go on measuring our
national life in billions of dollars of GNP. For the benefit
of the few readers of The Wall Street Journal who have not
learned the new language of finance, the title of this
article is a slogan popular in Japan in the 1970s. It means
"GNP Go to Hell]"
