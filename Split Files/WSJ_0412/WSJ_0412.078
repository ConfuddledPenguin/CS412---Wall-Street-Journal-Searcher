   Making Vacation Travel
   Less Free and Easy

   WHEN AIRLINES start looking for travelers to stick with
higher fares, business passengers usually get stuck first.
This year, though, the airlines seem to have a new target:
vacationers.
   Restricted coach fares, which vacation travelers rely on,
are 10% higher than a year ago, according to an April 1
survey of fares by American Express Travel Related Services
Inc. By contrast, the discount coach fares that business
people use most have climbed only 3%.
   Some of the vacation-travel increases are substantial. The
cheapest fare this year between New York and Minneapolis was
$156 each way on April 1, based on round-trip purchase -- or
25% higher than a year earlier. The best deal from Los
Angeles to Dallas is 21% higher. From New York to Washington,
the lowest leisure fare has jumped 68% to $99 one way.
   Hitting business people with the brunt of air-fare
increases is a time-honored tradition. After all, though
vacationers can dig in the garden rather than fly to Hawaii
if fares rise, most business people must travel. Or so the
theory goes.
   But airlines are concerned that many companies are cutting
back on travel, some analysts say. And more corporations are
striking special discount-fare arrangements with airlines.
So, carriers are compensating by boosting leisure fares --
though not so much, they hope, that they scare off the
vacation-bound.
   "You can only raise the business fares so high," says
Ignacio Maza, director of air-fare management for American
Express.
                                                                                                       

   Car-Rental Customers
   Yield Some Privacy
                                                                                                       

   TO RENT A CAR, it may no longer be enough to show that you
have a driver's license and credit card. You may also need a
clean driving record.
   In a controversial move, some smaller car-rental companies
are running background checks on drivers who rent for long
periods to see if they've had any serious violations. They
say such checks are both legal and smart. "I'm just trying to
protect my business," says Howard Kirmsse, president of a
Rent-A-Wreck franchise in Cherry Hill, N.J.
   But such checks make privacy specialists nervous. For one
thing, the data-base companies that do the checking aren't
always accurate, they say. Also, a rental company doesn't
usually tell customers they're being scrutinized. Evan
Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, says: "It's not illegal,
but I have a real problem with people being checked out
behind their backs."
   The biggest car-rental companies say they don't make such
checks, in part because they still take too long. But with
improved technology, that could change. "It's not a bad
idea," says James Philion, president of Thrifty Rent-A-Car
System Inc.
   For now, poring over motor-vehicle records can take up to
a week, which is why Mr. Kirmsse checks only drivers who are
keeping his car for more than a month. So far, he says, he
hasn't had to contact a customer and ask for a car back. But
he says he might do so if he discovers a driver has a
conviction for driving while intoxicated.
                                                                                                       

   Airline Passengers
   Given Added Weight
                                                                                                       

   MAYBE ALL THOSE fattening airline meals have something to
do with it, but the airline industry has decided that
Americans are putting on a few pounds.
   Several domestic and foreign airlines are planning to
raise the standard weight figure they use for passengers in
determining the total loaded weight of any aircraft. It's
about time. Under the current U.S. standard -- which hasn't
changed since 1946 -- the "average" traveler weighs 160
pounds in the summer and, with an allowance for heavier
clothing, 165 pounds in the winter.
   This has raised a few chuckles in the industry. "Did they
decide this after looking at me?" asks one airline executive.
But in reality, this is an important issue for airlines. By
law, airplanes can't take off if they're too heavy, so the
weight of everything aboard must be calculated -- down to the
laminated safety cards. The weight must also be carefully
distributed.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which sets the U.S.
standard, says it plans to revise the figure "a bit upward"
because of some accidents involving uneven passenger
weighting and studies of actual passenger weights. British
Airways recently raised its weight estimate by one kilogram,
or 2.2 pounds.
   Most airlines are also factoring in more weight for the
carry-on luggage. Each passenger hauls about five pounds of
carry-on bags, airlines say. And United Airlines estimates
that 80% of all its passengers now carry some luggage on
board, up from 36% in the 1950s.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   NOBODY'S GETTING any overtime for it, but 43% of all
business fliers travel for work outside of normal business
hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. And 16% of them start their trips
on weekends, according to an analysis of 52,000 travelers by
Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana, Calif. . . . Even
Donald Trump can't control the weather. Right after he began
offering an on-time guarantee on the Trump Shuttle last
month, heavy fog and rain hit Boston and New York. The
airline had promised to compensate customers whose flights
were late with tickets good for free weekend travel by a
companion. In the first week of the promotion, the shuttle's
on-time record fell to 80% from the usual 90%, a Trump
spokeswoman says; in 17 days, the airline gave away 15,000
awards.
