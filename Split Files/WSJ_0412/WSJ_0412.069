   MADRID -- Spain's consumer price index rose a moderate
0.4% in March from February, mainly because of higher
housing, household good and health costs, according to
provisional figures released by the National Institute of
Statistics.
   Last month's CPI data indicate that prices rose 7% from
March last year and 2% from December.
