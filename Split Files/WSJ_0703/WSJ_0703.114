   NEW YORK -- Ogden Corp. said its Ogden Allied Services
Corp. unit and Universal Services, a Seattle-based remote
services concern, have formed a joint venture, Universal
Ogden Services.
   Ogden said the company, to be based in Seattle, will be
one of the largest remote services companies in the U.S.,
providing catering, housekeeping and other services to
hundreds of offshore and other secluded locations throughout
the U.S., Canada and Europe.

   Universal Ogden, with 3,000 employees, will serve roughly
50,000 meals daily; it is expected to have revenue of $135
million for 1991, an Ogden spokesman said.
   Universal Services was founded in 1946 to house and feed
the large work force rebuilding defense bases in Alaska
following World War II. Ogden, in a statement, said a
division of Ogden Allied Services pioneered the remote site
catering business to the oil and and gas drilling industries
in the Gulf of Mexico.
