   NEW YORK -- Lewis E. Lehrman, a top executive at Morgan
Stanley Group Inc.'s burgeoning asset-management division,
jumped ship to head a financial forecasting firm.
   Mr. Lehrman's departure is the most visible of several
executive shuffles at Morgan Stanley following a recent shift
in the big securities firm's uppermost management echelons,
spurred by the retirement of its chairman. Morgan Stanley, by
many measures the healthiest firm on Wall Street, recently
reassigned the managers of its equity group in London. More
executive changes are expected soon.

   But Mr. Lehrman's move isn't likely to stunt the growth of
Morgan Stanley's asset-management unit. During his two-year
stint as managing director and chief operating officer, this
division has blossomed into a major driver of Morgan
Stanley's success.
   The asset-management division manages about $30 billion,
up 20% in the past two years. The division should generate
$120 million in revenue this year, including about $20
million from the management of Morgan Stanley Leveraged
Equity Fund II, says Samuel Liss, an analyst at Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Its equity and balanced portfolios have performed in the
top 25% of a broad universe of managed funds over the past 10
years, and its bond portfolios are in the top 1%, according
to a recent report by Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Michael Crowe, a principal in the firm's San Francisco
office, will assume Mr. Lehrman's duties, including marketing
Morgan Stanley's mutual funds, a spokesman said. The firm
hasn't filled the post of chief operating officer.
   For Mr. Lehrman, the move is the latest twist in a career
that included a stint in the public eye in a failed New York
gubernatorial bid against Mario Cuomo in 1982. Before aiming
his sights on politics, Mr. Lehrman was president of
drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp.
   In his new post, Mr. Lehrman will head Bell Mueller Cannon
Inc., a Washington-based financial forecasting firm that will
be renamed Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon. The two-year-old firm
provides monthly economic forecasts and political analysis to
banks, brokerage firms, money managers and corporations.
   In an interview, Mr. Lehrman said it would take five years
to build the venture into a major firm. Why leave Morgan
Stanley when it's thriving? "My greatest joy has been
pioneering new ideas or new businesses or new products," he
said.
   Morgan Stanley recently announced a change in top
management following the retirement, effective Jan. 1, of
Chairman S. Parker Gilbert. Among other moves, Richard Fisher
is slated to become chairman and Robert Greenhill will be
president.
   The firm's asset-management unit hasn't been the only
division facing personnel shifts lately. The firm recently
reassigned Will Osborne to head its equity capital-markets
office in London, replacing Amir Eilon, who will focus on
"strategic equity projects," according to an internal Morgan
Stanley memo.
   Vikram Pandit will replace Mr. Osborne as head of New York
Equity Capital Markets, and two other London-based equity
professionals have been reassigned following the
disappointing performance of two recent stock offerings.
