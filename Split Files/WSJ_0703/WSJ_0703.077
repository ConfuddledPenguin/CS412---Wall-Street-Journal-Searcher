   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Britain have reached an
agreement to expand air services, Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said.
   The agreement is an amendment to the bilateral pact that
governs air service between the U.S. and Britain. The
amendment, finalized Thursday, will increase the number of
trans-Atlantic routes.

   The new agreement makes permanent American Airlines's
right to serve the Chicago-Manchester route. The unit of AMR
Corp. has been serving the route under temporary authority,
department officials said. In addition, the U.S. government
may select airlines for two additional routes between the
U.S. and non-London airports.
   Britain may authorize a second airline for the
London-Boston route now flown by British Airways, and open
two routes between non-London airports and the U.S.
