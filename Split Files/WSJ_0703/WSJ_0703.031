   WILLIAMSON COUNTY, Tenn. -- Before the president's
reversal on taxes last week, this was George Bush country.
   It still is.

<TEXT>
   At a Republican rally and in conversations with dozens of
voters in the prosperous Nashville bedroom communities of
Williamson County -- where Mr. Bush won 72% of the vote in
1988 -- the overriding reaction is faith in the president's
judgment and a willingness to back him up. George Bush,
Republicans here say, is our man -- and the country would be
better off if the Democrats in Congress would just leave the
poor man alone.
   "I don't know too many people who are delighted at the
prospect of having their taxes raised," says Keith Jordan, a
Republican candidate for the Tennessee state Senate. "But if
taxes are going to be raised, you'd rather it be by someone
who has to be dragged kicking and screaming all the way
rather than someone who is leading the raise."
   Says Harry Morel, a farmer who first voted for Wendell L.
Willkie in the 1940 presidential election: "Listen, what is a
little old country boy out here going to know about raising
taxes countrywide? That man is qualified, he's got qualified
people, and if they say it has to be done, I accept it."
   Six weeks ago, when the bipartisan budget negotiations in
Washington were getting under way, this newspaper talked to
some of these same people and found they believed Mr. Bush
would have to change his position. Now that he has, there is
little sense of betrayal, even among those who would have
preferred no tax increases.
   "I still think that President Bush is keeping the faith
because I think that he will raise taxes {only} on
non-essential items," says Paul Simpson, a lawyer in the next
congressional district.
   Mr. Simpson's congressman, Republican Don Sundquist, is
doing his best to reassure the party faithful that Mr. Bush
isn't selling out on the issue. Rep. Sundquist, in Williamson
County to address the GOP rally, assures the crowd: "I can
tell you this: This president will not agree to any package
that does not change the process that made it possible for us
to get into the mess that we're in today. The spenders are
the ones that got us into the trouble."
   Other congressional Republicans are using variations of
that same theme in an effort to deflect voter resentment.
"People who are very concerned with the deficit have no faith
in the Congress to do anything about it," says Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois, GOP candidate for the Senate against
incumbent Democrat Paul Simon this year.
   But other Republican lawmakers, after talking to
constituents, are more resentful. They say that while
President Bush may personally escape blame for a tax
increase, his reversal has cost his party one of its most
potent campaign issues, which can't help but harm GOP
candidates this year.
   After meeting with a visiting delegation of his staunchest
campaign supporters last weekend, California GOP Rep.
Christopher Cox says that Mr. Bush has "compromised" the
party's "longtime anti-tax stance." He adds, "If the
Republicans are for higher taxes, then we are witnessing the
convergence of the two parties. In the future, it will be
very hard to distinguish a Republican from a Democrat."
   Rep. Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island, the Senate
candidate against Democratic incumbent Claiborne Pell, notes
that many of her colleagues "were awfully adamant about
holding out on taxes, so yes, there will be defections on
taxes."
   Rep. Sundquist, a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee, understands well the discontent, particularly from
Republicans challenging incumbent Democrats for the Senate.
"I understand where they're at and I don't criticize them for
it," he says. "But those of us in the House who aren't
running for the Senate who are George Bush supporters ought
to be there with him."
   While many among the congressman's audience here seem to
agree, one critical factor will be what kind of new taxes
come out of any budget agreement.
   For example, the prospect of any change in the income-tax
structure creates a visceral and unambiguously negative
response. Few of the audience would likely be affected by any
such change, which would almost surely be aimed at the
highest-income taxpayers. But almost all those interviewed
fear tampering with the rate structure nonetheless.
   "I do believe that {Bush} will come through this
harassment and he'll do a great job," says Bernadine
Lipinski, a former president of the local Republican women's
club. "But I do not believe that he will raise income taxes.
He will take some other route, but it's not going to be a
large tax increase and he's not going to go back on his
word."
   On the other hand, higher excise taxes on cigarettes and
beer don't seem to trouble these Republicans very much.
Sheriff Robert Lee of McNairy County, over in Congressman
Sundquist's district, says that in his county "you can tax
cigarettes and beer a penny or a nickel or a quarter and it
won't have any effect whatsoever."
   Not all the Republicans in this area are in a forgiving
mood where Mr. Bush is concerned. "Read my lips: I will never
vote for the man again," says Tom Singleton, an executive for
a hospital management company. But most of those troubled
seem to be more upset that Mr. Bush broke his word than that
their taxes might rise.
   "I think that he was ill-advised to make a promise that's
going to be used against him," says Larry Barnes, a police
officer in Franklin. "I'm disappointed not that taxes were
raised, but that {Bush} promised that he wouldn't raise
them."
   One reason there was little anger over the president's
reversal, Rep. Schneider suggests, is that few voters were
really surprised by it. "The agreement to raise taxes is a
blip on the scale of cynicism," she says. "It's not a
firestorm, but a brushfire."
   That would explain the comments of William Cowan Sr., a
farmer from LaGrange in Rep. Sundquist's district, who summed
up what seems the prevailing attitude. Is he disappointed in
the president's decision? he is asked. "Well, a little bit,
but not that much," he replies. "He's just politickin'."
