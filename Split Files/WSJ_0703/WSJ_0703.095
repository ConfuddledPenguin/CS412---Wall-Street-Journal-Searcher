   Perry Drug Stores, Inc., Pontiac Mich., said it has signed
an agreement to acquire for an undisclosed price 24
additional former Revco drugstores throughout Michigan.
   Separately, Perry said it has completed the acquisition of
16 former Revco drugstores in the Detroit area, previously
announced on May 19.

   The sales are part of a larger transaction in which Revco
sold 221 stores through Chapter 11 proceedings to Reliable
Drug Stores Inc. of Indianapolis.
   The acquisitions tie in with Perry's strategy of filling
in existing markets and of concentrating on Michigan, said
Jack A. Robinson, Perry's chairman and chief executive
officer. With these two acquisitions, Perry will operate 210
drugstores throughout Michigan, reinforcing its position as
Michigan's No. 1 drugstore chain. Perry also operates 23
stores in the Chicago area.
