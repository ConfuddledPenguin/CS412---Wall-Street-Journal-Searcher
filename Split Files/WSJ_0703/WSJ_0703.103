   Biocontrol's vascular access device, known as the
Bio-Port, is a drug delivery receptacle that is implanted
beneath the skin. The device eliminates skin and blood vessel
damage when repeated injections are necessary, such as in
chemotherapy treatment.
   The company said its market research indicates a $50
million annual market for these devices world-wide.
