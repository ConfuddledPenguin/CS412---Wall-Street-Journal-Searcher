   BASF AG, a West German chemical company, put its U.S.
flavors and fragrances operating unit and its North American
ink business up for sale, saying the non-core lines don't fit
into its long-term growth strategy.
   BASF hired Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., New York, to find a
buyer for the Fritzsche Dodge &amp; Olcott unit, which develops,
makes and markets products world-wide for the nutrition and
cosmetics industries. It retained Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., New
York, to arrange the ink business's sale.

   Fritzsche Dodge, acquired in 1980 from the family that
founded it in 1798, has 850 employees, 550 of them in the
U.S. BASF declined to disclose financial details, but
Fritzsche Dodge's annual sales have been estimated at about
$150 million. A spokesman in the U.S. said the divestiture
proposal shouldn't affect the unit's capital spending plans
of about $600 million this year, up from $460 million in
1989.
   The printing ink operations in the U.S. and Canada, with
about 1,400 employees, make and supply printing ink and
auxiliary products to the publication, packaging and
commercial printing industries.
