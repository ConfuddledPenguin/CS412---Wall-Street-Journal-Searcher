   Retribution for the savings-and-loan debacle is a tornado
on the political horizon. An outburst might even sweep some
incumbents from the U.S. House of Lords in November. Come
1992, when the full dimensions of this taxpayer rout are
better grasped and the father of Silverado Savings director
Neil Bush presumably stands for re-election, the full storm
may hit.
   A bailout totaling hundreds of billions of dollars will
cause dramatic interstate shifts of federal revenues. This
magnifies the opportunity for smooth demagogues like Mario
Cuomo of New York to contrast the tab for the salvage of Sun
Belt thrifts with the familiar miseries of his own welfare
state -- as if making good on deposit insurance were some new
discretionary expenditure by Washington in place of feeding
the hungry.

   Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.), probably is hamming it up
himself in decrying the big salaries that the Resolution
Trust Corp., the thrift-bailout agency, has been paying
executives of busted S&amp;Ls as it tries to rescue them. If some
of these institutions are to escape insolvency through
legitimate creative financing, it's likely to take more than
a high-grade civil servant -- helped along by lots of
congressional "oversight" -- to pull it off.
   But journalists can sympathize with how difficult it is
for Rep. Vento's staff to discover much about Uncle Sam's
wards. Raw data finally have been coughed up and must be
analyzed. Earlier, it transpired that the conservator of
Franklin Savings in Kansas, John Carr, is getting $225,000
for six months. When I poked into Franklin a few months ago,
Mr. Carr was unavailable for any inquiries. Same with
officials of the hundreds of other taken-over thrifts.
   Press calls are referred to regional Resolution Trust
offices, which can be informational black holes as bad as any
in Washington. The RTC's Denver office has one spokesman for
all its thrifts in the West, and responses are spotty. I was
able to confirm one example of the kind of outrage that will
keep Rep. Vento at full volume until the Mississippi River
runs dry back home.
   My little tale involves California's Gibraltar Savings,
which at $13 billion in purported assets was the biggest of
the Western fish to land up in the RTC frypan. That was in
March 1989. The top guy at Gibraltar was forced out (replaced
by the same Mr. Carr who later turned up at Franklin), but
for the next nine months, the holdover senior managers
continued on in rather comfortable limbo. Finally the RTC's
man told them they'd have to give up a benefits plan that
included first-dollar coverage for all medical and dental
costs, including prescription drugs and cosmetic surgery.
   It was this April 1 before the supplemental fringes wound
down. Now breast enhancements and daily therapy sessions for
the lovelorn (two examples I heard about) would no longer be
a corporate/taxpayer expense. By themselves these perks may
not have amounted to much of the U.S. budget deficit -- I
couldn't find out how much, but Gibraltar was just returned
to the private sector at a $628 million federal loss -- yet
they and the fat paychecks are indicative of a way of life,
an arrogant irresponsibility, that can arouse a cynical
nation in a way mere red ink never will. It does little good
(and costs more money) to try to throw the worst of the S&amp;L
lot in jail, as politicians are wont to do with white-collar
wastrels other than themselves, but if the Resolution Trust
and its parent Bush administration appear to be protecting
this breed, they will inherit the prairie windstorm.
   The popular explanation for the pillaging of American
financial institutions during the 1980s has become
"deregulation." This simple theme was established by persons
seeking the power of re-regulation, echoed in the media. Full
deregulation would have no more handed the Treasury keys to
the glittering thrift shops than it does to the diners and
dry-cleaners next door to them on Main Street.
   It took special dispensation for this thievery to occur,
and as the editors of this paper keep trying to point out,
the rise in federal deposit insurance to $100,000 from
$40,000 per account in 1980 seems to explain much of the
story. The complicity of the Reagan administration and in
particular Donald Regan in what followed, including the gaps
in supervision of a runaway industry, rates those Republicans
special condemnation. But the legislative act itself was
primarily one by Democrats, ratified in a bipartisan 380-13
vote to okay the Depository Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act of 1980.
   One shouldn't put too much of a stigma on that final
tally, although it's all we have by which to remember most of
our legislators on this matter. The law did much to liberate
and perhaps save a good part of U.S. finance, most
importantly by eliminating Regulation Q, an interest-rate
ceiling that made it near impossible to obtain deposits at a
time of sky-high nominal yields. Indeed, Congressional
Quarterly listed the insurance-cap rise 38th among the
provisions of the bill, in an 11-word reference. The baker's
dozen in opposition were a political smattering, but the
presence among them of Texas libertarian Ron Paul and a few
other consistent foes of Potomac rule ought to have clued
others not to be silent.
   Much as deposit insurance cries out for reform, the Bush
Treasury Department appears no more quick on this political
draw than on other aspects of the S&amp;L quagmire. Secretary
Nicholas Brady's study of the issue drags on. Our front-page
story today offers hope the review eventually will lead
somewhere.
   Incriminating as the evidence on deposit insurance might
seem, at least one market-oriented analyst is challenging the
idea that it was central to the thrift crisis. George
Benston, a finance professor at Emory University's business
school, is concluding in a study for the National Bureau of
Economic Research that in the Southeast, at least,
interest-rate losses of the early 1980s, and not credit
losses after that, explain most of the troubles.
   Prof. Benston has a history on this subject. During the
mid-1980s, he argued on the Journal's editorial page and
elsewhere that regulators shouldn't bar thrifts from
investments outside their traditional home-mortgage base. He
maintained that diversification was the great hope for S&amp;Ls
caught in the vise of higher rates on deposits (revenue
outflow) and low yields on residential loans (inflow). But
the dally with office towers and shopping centers has been
blamed for much of the calamity that has since unfolded.
Critics found him a Pollyanna and tarred his work by noting a
tie to a law firm retained by notorious thrift magnate
Charles Keating.
   Mr. Benston isn't giving an inch. The "few wildmen" (like
Mr. Keating) who've become symbols of graft were the
responsibility of those in charge of supervision, who often
ignored warnings from their field offices. However, the bulk
of the industry's losses were sustained elsewhere and
earlier. In the larger sense, Mr. Benston muses, "Who are the
crooks? People like me who had 6% mortgages. That's where the
money went." He points to regulator testimony to Congress in
March that CenTrust, the Florida thrift whose finery recently
was auctioned by the feds to try to narrow a $2 billion loss,
was $525 million in the hole before a profligate new owner
bought his first junk bond.
   The thrift bailout law of 1989, Mr. Benston concludes,
just puts the industry -- to the extent it survives -- back
where it was before the disastrous cycle of the '80s, with
most of its assets in home mortgages susceptible to perilous
interest-rate swings. If he is right, there will have been
paid an enormous price, in dollars and possibly political
careers, for precious little.
