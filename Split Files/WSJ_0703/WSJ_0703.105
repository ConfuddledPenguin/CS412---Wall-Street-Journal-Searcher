   Two years after initially bidding to provide software to
the NASA/Ames Research Center in California, Sterling
Software Inc., Dallas, said it has signed a three-year
contract with a two-year renewal option. The contract has
been valued by NASA at $210 million, according to company
officials.
   Sterling has had a similar contract with Ames since 1970,
but in 1988 lost its renewal bid to Computer Sciences Corp.
of El Segundo, Calif. Sterling appealed, on the basis that
Computer Sciences hadn't submitted the low bid, but lost. It
appealed again and won, with a panel of the Board of Contract
Appeals of the General Services Administration concluding
that Computer Sciences had misrepresented its bid.
