   When Summer Comes,
   Work on Friday Goes

   FRIDAYS IN SUMMER are increasingly relaxed.
   Some 3,000 workers at Fluor Corp. in Irvine, Calif.,
accumulate extra hours to earn alternate summer Fridays off.
At two other sites, Fluor employees tally nine-hour days
Monday to Thursday and leave early every Friday.
   "It provides our employees with a benefit without a
dramatic increase in costs," says Chuck Bradley, vice
president for human resources.
   At Thom McAn Shoe Co. in Worcester, Mass., 500 workers
squeeze in 40 hours before quitting at 1 p.m. on Fridays,
when casual dress is also permitted. "It's something that
makes {employees} feel good about the company," says Richard
E. Cramer, director of marketing.
   One-third of companies now adopt special schedules each
summer and more plan them, says a survey by the Society for
Human Resource Management. One-quarter of such programs are
less than two years old.
   Client needs often preclude abbreviated hours. But "if the
realities of your business mean you can close early, you
should offer this," advises Michael B. Jones, partner with
benefits consultants Hewitt Associates.
   Promus Cos., formerly Holiday Corp., has half days on
Fridays year-round at its Memphis, Tenn., headquarters, an
outgrowth of a popular summer program started in 1985. "If I
tried to take it away now," says Neil F. Barnhart, a Promus
vice president, "I'd have a real problem."
                                                                                                       

   Some Old Heroes Exit
   With Graduation March
                                                                                                       

   THE NEXT generation of managers doesn't think much of
tobacco makers, Exxon Corp. or Donald Trump.
   According to a University of Pittsburgh survey of 710
newly minted M.B.A.s, polled from a dozen schools nationwide,
they're also less interested in finance.
   Just 22% expect to specialize in finance, down from 32%
last year. Marketing and consulting each attracted 19%, while
investment banking (10%) and general management jobs (8%)
lagged in popularity. Men favored finance over consulting and
marketing, while women put marketing first and finance last.
   The graduates cited advancement opportunity as the most
important factor in job selection, followed by job
responsibility, work environment and location.
   Among the 82% of graduates who ruled out entire industries
in their job searches, 61% said they wouldn't work for
tobacco producers. Also on the blacklist were investment
banks (39%), defense contractors (35%), alcohol makers (25%),
direct investors in South Africa (24%), oil and gas companies
(19%) and foreign-owned companies (9%).
   Exxon, as Valdez villain, topped the list of least-admired
companies. General Motors, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Texas Air
and Philip Morris filled out the notoriety roster.
   Merck &amp; Co. ranked highest among most-admired companies,
followed by Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney Co., General
Electric and Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   More than half of the M.B.A.s said they hoped eventually
to become entrepreneurs, so H. Ross Perot's selection as the
most-admired person was no surprise.
   But Mr. Trump, popular in previous surveys, "dropped
totally off the page this year," says Daniel R. Nagy, the
Pitt official who ran the poll.
                                                                                                       

   Resume-Snippet Book:
   Flip Side to Classifieds
                                                                                                       

   NUMBER 602 is an experienced bank manager, fluent in
Spanish, who seeks a $45,000 salary. Number 810, a veteran
executive of several big consumer products companies, sports
an M.B.A. and would settle for $175,000. Number 1017 knows
cosmetics inside out, boasts "excellent people skills" and
can be had for just $100,000.
   "The Directory of Available Executives," published by
outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc., includes thumbnail
listings of hundreds of managers and others who have lost
their jobs over the past year. Quarterly editions of the
directory, with separate editions for the New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles areas, are being sent to hundreds of
recruiters and headhunters.
   "In the past, our job search counseling and support
process hadn't included any pro-active effort to make
candidates visible in the marketplace," says Penny Shaw,
senior vice president. "This is a way of doing that."
   The company got 300 inquiries in response to the April
mailing of its New York directory, resulting in a handful of
offers. Callers refer to job-seekers by code and are sent a
complete resume without cost, but candidates aren't told of
the requests. That keeps down expectations and anxiety. "In
following up, people can do more harm than good," says Cathy
Kennedy, the firm's marketing administrator.
   Drake Beam Morin Inc., a competing firm, is developing
listings of its clients, too, suggesting that the format may
become more common. Says Thomas E. Price, a Drake Beam vice
president: "It's one more way to help people identify
opportunities."
   Not everyone wants a listing. Some "want tight control
over their search" and don't want to publicize their
credentials too widely, Ms. Kennedy says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   HARDER WORK: Some 95% of managers toil more than 40 hours
a week and 66% feel more stress now than a decade ago, says a
survey of 1,300 managers by Priority Management Systems Inc.,
Bellevue, Wash. . . . Smart money? New York University's
Stern School of Business touts its $68 million new complex,
for which it broke ground last month, as "the most expensive
property in the history of management education."
