   HOUSTON -- A federal bankruptcy judge dismissed Members
Service Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing.
   Judge Randolph Wheless Jr. granted Members Service's
request to dismiss its six-week-old bankruptcy court
petition. The company said it sought court protection in late
May after the Internal Revenue Service unexpectedly demanded
payment for delinquent taxes.

   Members Service, which has holdings in telecommunications,
energy and financial services, claimed the funds sought by
the agency were the result of action by an "overzealous
Internal Revenue agent." It acknowledged it had bought some
companies with tax liabilities, but said it had met two IRS
schedules for payment and was prepared to meet a third when
the demand was made for accelerated payment.
   An IRS spokesman declined to comment on the company's
charge regarding one of its agents. The spokesman said the
agency has a lien pending against Members Service for $91,572
for failure to withhold Social Security and federal income
taxes. The lien, filed in Harris County here, is against
three units, and has not been withdrawn, the IRS said.
   As for the payment schedules, the IRS-spokesman said,
"they know something we don't know if they're talking about
an installment agreement."
   James R. Beazle, executive vice president for Members
Service, said he was unaware of any lien against the company
and, contrary to the IRS's contention, Members Service had
completed the IRS schedules for payment.
