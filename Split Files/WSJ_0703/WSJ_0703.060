   WEST BERLIN -- A day after Germany's monetary and economic
merger, the once-sleepy Berlin stock exchange was gripped
with high hopes of once again being a major player in
European finance.
   The floor opened with ringing bells and shouting brokers
as buy orders were rushed into the circular trading area. By
midmorning, most brokers were registering above-average
volume as investors bought pieces of a unified German
economy.

   Bonds were firming nicely, and the DAX German stock index
was up about 1.8% from Friday. A hot local stock was Berliner
Kindl Braueri AG, a big West Berlin brewer with vast plots of
city real estate on its books.
   "For Day-X plus one, this is a great beginning," said
Bernd Bollhof, a floor trader for Dresdner Bank AG. "Everyone
is relieved that all went so smoothly Sunday. Last week,
there were still many pessimists who thought something would
go wrong."
   But East German consumers didn't storm into Western shops,
and inflation didn't rise overnight. And, in the words of
Bonn Finance Minister Theo Waigel, "Everything is under
control."
   So far, anyway. But pessimists are a rare breed at the
Berlin bourse since the Berlin Wall burst open Nov. 9. The
Berlin exchange has long been a second-tier player in the
backwater of a West German financial system dominated by the
Frankfurt banking capital. Among West Germany's eight stock
exchanges, West Berlin has been fighting a seesaw battle with
the Stuttgart exchange for fifth place in trading volume.
   With West Germany's banks set on remaining centered in
Frankfurt, the Berlin exchange is unlikely to ever regain the
leading position held at the turn of the century, when major
banks and corporations were still based in Berlin.
   Yet Berlin wants a lot of that business back. And if it
can't overtake Frankfurt, the Berlin stock exchange is out to
regain at least some of its old prominence and prestige.
   Rid of the wall and four decades of isolation, Berlin is a
thriving metropolis with a new lease on life. The effect on
the exchange has been infectious after four irksome decades
of living in the shadow of Frankfurt. Sometimes called
"Bankfurt," the financial capital is a fraction of Berlin's
size and has little worldly luster. But it still controls 75%
of West German securities trading and treats the smaller
German exchanges more or less like branch offices.
   Frankfurt lists 850 stocks to the Berlin exchange's 400,
which include most West German blue chips. But this could
soon change as more international interest focuses on the
reunified city, particularly if it is restored as Germany's
capital. Moreover, the Treuhandanstalt public trust set up by
the East German government to privatize 8,000 state-owned
East German companies is only just across town.
   "Of those, we expect that between 500 and 600 {companies}
will eventually be floated in public offering. And we already
have indications that they will be listed here, giving us a
real chance to build," said Wilfried G. Huebscher, director
of the West Berlin exchange.
   The big German banks are competing intensively to be the
first one to bring an East German company public; the
prestige benefit would be priceless. The exchange director
said he believes Dresdner Bank already has two candidates.
"And you have to assume that if Dresdner has two, Deutsche
Bank must have at least two," he said. Directors of several
East German corporations have also come to the Berlin
exchange independently, asking for advice on public
offerings.
   "Berlin is their place, why would they want to go to
Frankfurt?" said the exchange's Mr. Huebscher, who added that
he isn't at all happy about plans by the Frankfurt-based
Association of German Stock Exchanges to help erect a new
stock exchange in Leipzig. "There is a small disagreement on
that point," he said. "Our aim is to strengthen Berlin."
   The West German government agrees. In a Sunday newspaper
interview, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said he would
like to see East and West German joint ventures to be listed
on the Berlin stock exchange. "I don't consider this to be
utopia," he asserted.
   Even without official endorsements, Berlin is a likely
candidate to become the primary exchange for East German
share offerings. The exchange already is attracting new
members interested in stocking up their German growth fund
portfolios. Bourse officials speak confidently of expanding
their cramped office facilities to accomodate new resident
banks.
   Six financial institutions have joined the exchange's
membership roster since November, bringing the number of
members to 56. The new arrivals include Nomura Securities
Ltd. of Japan and Italy's IMI Bank group. The exchange also
has been contacted by several big Japanese investment groups,
as well as France's Compagnie Financiere de Paribas and
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. from the U.S.
   "We were always neglected out here. Now we're seeing the
avalanche effect," said Ursula Wiegand, the exchange's public
relations official.
