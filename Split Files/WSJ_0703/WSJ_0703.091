   GNI Group Inc. said the start-up and commercial operation
of a new chemical resource processing plant will result in a
nearly 40% increase in both revenue and net income for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1991.
   For the year ended June 30, 1989, the Houston company
reported a loss of $75,000, or two cents a share, on revenue
of about $12.5 million. Results for the period included a
$550,000 charge related to the write-down of assets. The
company expects to release earnings for fiscal 1990 in early
August.
