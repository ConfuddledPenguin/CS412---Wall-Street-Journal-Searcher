   Tate &amp; Lyle PLC, a British sugar company, said it will not
proceed to bid for Berisford International PLC, a British
food, property and jewelry concern.
   In a statement, Tate and Lyle said its appraisal of some
of Berisford's non-sugar businesses showed a takeover would
be ill-advised. Berisford had no immediate comment on Tate &amp;
Lyle's decision.

   Last month, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry
ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of such a
merger on the country's sugar industry. Berisford and Tate &amp;
Lyle together control about 95% of the country's sugar
supplies.
   A Tate &amp; Lyle spokesman said the investigation "led Tate &amp;
Lyle to conclude that it didn't want to proceed with a bid
for the company."
   The inquiry also found that an acquisition of Berisford
would jeopardize Tate &amp; Lyle's cane sugar refining margins. A
Tate &amp; Lyle spokesman said a merger with Berisford, a large
sugar beet refiner, might have led to an end to European
Community and U.K. government payments, which support Tate &amp;
Lyle's cane sugar refining activities against competition in
the EC.
