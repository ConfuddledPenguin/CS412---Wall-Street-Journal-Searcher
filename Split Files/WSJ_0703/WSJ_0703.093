   Over-the-counter stocks drifted quietly in pre-holiday
trading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.25 to 462.04, a 0.05%
loss, as volume sagged to 114.2 million from 158.8 million
Friday. Declining stocks outpaced advancers, 960 to 900.
However, 111 shares hit new highs while 60 traded to new
lows.

   "It was very quiet throughout the market," said Patrick
Kane, senior OTC trader with Robinson Humphrey &amp; Co.,
Atlanta, adding that no patterns were apparent in yesterday's
trading. With a number of investors and traders away for the
Fourth of July, Mr. Kane predicted that by noon today there
will be very little market activity.
   Trading was "a mixed bag" at Cowen &amp; Co.'s San Francisco
office, according to Jerry Newman, an institutional trader
there. Mr. Newman noted that shares of some software
companies and makers of voice processing systems fell amid
negative news from individual companies in those industries.
   Digital Sound plunged 4 1/4 to 5 after the Santa Barbara,
Calif., maker of voice processing systems said it expects to
report a loss for the second quarter ended June 30. Citing a
slower-than-anticipated order rate from certain major
customers, Digital Sound said second-quarter sales were
substantially lower than first-quarter net sales of about
$9.25 million.
   Among other makers of voice processing systems, Octel
Communications fell 1 1/4 to 21 1/2.
   Borland plummeted 4 3/8 to 17 on nearly 1.2 million shares
after Lotus Development filed a lawsuit against the Scotts
Valley, Calif., software maker charging it with copyright
infringement.
   Borland said that on Friday it sued Lotus and asked court
confirmation that its spreadsheet product doesn't infringe
any copyrights of Lotus's 1-2-3 spreadsheet. Among other
software makers, Microsoft fell 2 1/4 to 73 1/4 and Lotus
eased 1/8 to 34 5/8.
   Mid-State Federal Savings Bank tumbled 4 1/4 to 19 after
First Florida Banks of Tampa, Fla., said it cut the price it
agreed to pay for Mid-State to $22.43 a share from a maximum
$27.41 a share under a previous agreement.
   Regency Cruises, trading under the symbol SHIP, was the
day's most-active stock. A group led by Rainbow Cruises Inc.
President Antonios E. Lelakis said it may seek representation
on Regency's board. The Rainbow Cruises group already has a
32.2% stake in the New York cruise line and said it might
seek control of Regency, among other business alternatives it
might consider. Shortly after the announcement, a 3.52
million-share block of Regency shares changed hands. The
stock closed unchanged at 2 1/32 on more than 4.1 million
shares.
   Westwood One added 1/2 to 5 1/2 after the Culver City,
Calif., radio-program producer said its losses for the second
quarter ended May 31 narrowed to 26 cents a share from a loss
of 45 cents a year earlier.
   Consilium advanced 1/2 to 25 1/4 after the Mountain View,
Calif., supplier of management software and services said
that Digital Equipment raised its stake in the company to
5.8% of Consilium's outstanding common shares.
   Favorable analysts' comments propelled Adobe Systems,
which gained 1 1/4 to 38 and Cirrus Logic, which climbed 3/4
to 20 7/8.
   Adobe Systems, a Mountain View., Calif., software maker,
got a boost in this week's edition of Barron's from T. Rowe
Price Science/Technology Fund manager Roger B. McNamee.
Yesterday morning, Lehman Brothers (formerly Shearson Lehman
Hutton) included Adobe in its list of 10 "uncommon values" in
the stock market.
   Goldman Sachs analyst Rajiv Chaudri repeated a
long-standing "buy" opinion on Cirrus Logic, a Milpitas,
Calif., maker of integrated circuits, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor report. Citing stronger-than-expected
demand for disk drives, Mr. Chaudri also raised his estimates
for the company's earnings for fiscal 1991 ending March to
$1.15 a share from $1.10.
   Immunogen jumped for the second consecutive day, but a
company official told DJPIR the company couldn't explain the
gains and noted that the start-up concern is expected to post
a loss for fiscal 1990. Thursday, the Cambridge, Mass.,
biotechnology company signed a joint research pact with
Immunomedics. However, PaineWebber biotechnology analyst
Linda Webber told the news service it's premature for
shareholders to react to the research pact. Immunogen rose 1
3/4 to 14 1/4 yesterday after a 1 1/4 gain Friday.
   Enzon tumbled 1 1/8 to 9 3/4 after the South Plainfield,
N.J., drug concern said it will delay filing an application
with the Food and Drug Administration for licensing of a
leukemia drug until it secures a long-term commitment from
the supplier of an enzyme critical to manufacturing the
product.
