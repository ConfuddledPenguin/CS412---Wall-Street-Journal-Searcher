   NEW YORK -- In what Imelda Marcos called the best birthday
present she ever received, a federal jury acquitted the
former first lady of the Philippines of all charges in her
racketeering trial.
   The jury, on its fifth day of deliberations, which was
Mrs. Marcos's 61st birthday, also found Adnan Khashoggi
innocent of the two charges against him. Mrs. Marcos was
accused of using $200 million allegedly stolen from the
Philippine government to buy jewelry, artwork and real estate
in the U.S. Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi businessman, was accused
of helping Mrs. Marcos hide her ownership of real estate in
Manhattan.

   Mrs. Marcos's supporters, who maintained a vigil with her
at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, immediately claimed
the verdict as a win not only for Mrs. Marcos, but as a
vindication of her late husband, Ferdinand Marcos, who died
last September. Mr. and Mrs. Marcos came to Hawaii in 1986
after they were ousted from power in Manila.
   "It's her commitment and responsibility to bring back the
remains of President Marcos to the Philippines so that he can
be buried alongside his mother," said Enrique Fernando,
former chief justice of the Philippine supreme court under
President Marcos. Mr. Fernando, now a lawyer in Manila,
served as one of Mrs. Marcos's advisers during the trial.
   "She shouldn't have been tried here at all in the U.S.,"
Mr. Fernando added. "It is a vindication of the Marcoses."
   The lack of specific evidence pinning the alleged
racketeering, obstruction of justice and mail fraud on Mrs.
Marcos -- as well as doubts that a U.S. court was the proper
venue for the trial -- hurt the prosecutors' case, some
jurors said after the verdict. The jury of seven women and
five men also appeared sympathetic to the sight of a widow
dressed in mourning clothes. As Mrs. Marcos's supporters
loudly cheered after the verdict was read, one juror blew
kisses to the spectators in the crowded courtroom.
   The jury's forewoman, Catherine Balton, a retired
secretary, said, "There was no evidence. It was a poorly
prepared case."
   Another juror, Thomas O'Rourke, a mason from the Bronx,
said the prosecution "did a terrible, terrible job. They had
half truths and not the right witnesses. . . . It may have
been a conspiracy {to commit racketeering}, but it didn't
involve Mrs. Marcos."
   Mr. O'Rourke also said the trial "was on the wrong side of
the ocean. . . . We are not big brothers to the people
overseas."
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which prosecuted
the case, conceded in its closing arguments that its case
against Mrs. Marcos was largely circumstantial. But they
argued that the evidence and the testimony of 95 witnesses
proved that Mrs. Marcos -- a member of President Marcos's
cabinet and a powerful government figure in her own right --
must have known that money stolen from the Philippine
government was being used to make the purchases in the U.S.
   People familiar with the government's investigation said
the case was seriously hurt just weeks ago, however, when two
Filipinos considered potential key witnesses decided not to
testify. Apparently they feared that their families and
assets in the Philippines would be at risk if President
Corazon Aquino -- President Marcos's successor -- falls from
power.
   Carmen Pedrosa, the spokeswoman in New York for the Aquino
government, said Mrs. Marcos is still banned from returning
to the Philippines because the former first lady is
considered a threat to national security. Ms. Pedrosa said
that if the government changes its policy and allows her to
return, criminal charges will be filed against her involving
the alleged theft of government funds. She said the
Philippines hasn't brought its own criminal case against Mrs.
Marcos because it doesn't want to allow her return.
   Referring to allegations made during the trial that
President Marcos routinely collected kickbacks and misused
government funds, Ms. Pedrosa said, "What this trial has
established clearly is what the Marcos regime was all about
-- unbridled corruption and total abuse of power."
   Stanley Karnow, who won a Pulitzer prize this year for his
book "In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines,"
said, "I think this will be another blow to the Aquino
government," which so far has staved off several coup
attempts.
   Mr. Karnow said the verdict is likely to bolster Aquino's
opposition, some of whom have been represented at the trial.
For instance, Celia Laurel, the wife of Philippine Vice
President Salvador Laurel, who has become one of Mrs.
Aquino's most vocal critics, visited Mrs. Marcos at the
courthouse recently and greeted her with a kiss during a
break in the trial. And the half sister of Juan Ponce Enrile,
a Philippine senator accused of plotting to overthrow Mrs.
Aquino, also accompanied Mrs. Marcos and her entourage during
part of the trial.
   Mr. Karnow, who was in the Philippines a few months ago,
said, "You're beginning to see the notion that Marcos, after
all, wasn't so bad, at least in the early years {of his
20-year reign}. . . . Some people are saying, `To hell with
democracy, what we really want is prosperity.' "
   From the very start of the trial, Mrs. Marcos's lead
attorney, Gerry Spence, maintained that Mrs. Marcos was being
unfairly held accountable for the alleged wrongdoing of her
husband. Even supporters of the prosecution concede that the
government's task became much more difficult with the death
of Mr. Marcos, who also was charged.
   While Mrs. Marcos long served as her husband's
globetrotting emissary and was appointed by him to powerful
positions such as governor of Manila, President Marcos may
have long ago decided to insulate her from his decisions
regarding money. In 1976, when Mrs. Marcos was believed to be
in line to succeed her husband as president should he fall
ill, Mr. Marcos told reporters, "She works on culture, the
arts and social welfare and development. When these subjects
involve finances and national politics, she refers everything
to me."
