   NEW YORK -- Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units posted a
narrower cumulative loss of $27.2 million for May on
depressed sales, reflecting lower inventory levels and the
sluggish economy.
   In documents filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court in
Cincinnati, Federated Department Stores Inc. said it had a
loss of $17.8 million for the four weeks ended June 2, while
Allied Stores Inc. had a loss of about $9.5 million. The
losses, which compared favorably with the $33.5 million loss
for the two units in the four-week period ended May 5, don't
include bankruptcy court-related expenses.

   For the four weeks ended May 5, Federated had a loss of
$18.1 million, and Allied had a loss of about $15.5 million.
Results for these four weeks were restated.
   Revenue in May decreased slightly at Federated and Allied.
Sales at Federated dropped 2.4% to $82.1 million for the four
weeks ended June 2 against $84.1 million for the four weeks
ended May 5. Revenue at Allied dropped 2.1% to $47.4 million
from $48.4 million.
   In a statement, Allen Questrom, chairman and chief
executive officer of Federated and Allied, said the May
results had been anticipated. "There is no shortcut through
this process," said Mr. Questrom. He added that he doesn't
expect the performance at Federated and Allied to improve
before the latter part of this year.
   In the court filing, Federated and Allied attributed the
poor May results to a new merchandising strategy that
includes lower inventory levels, fewer promotions, and the
willingness to take markdowns on slow moving goods in order
to bring in fresh stock.
   Federated and Allied also cited "a general weakening and
slowdown" in the U.S. economy as well as "unseasonably cool
and rainy weather," which hurt the sale of summer
merchandise.
   "The cumulative losses are approaching the point of
embarrassment, which leads me to believe an asset sale could
be imminent," said Alan Millstein, publisher of the Fashion
Network Report. "At best they may break even in August."
   A spokeswoman for Federated and Allied disagreed, noting
that a plan of reorganization is still being developed.
"Nothing substantive will be done prior to such a plan, which
won't be completed before this fall," said Carol Sanger, vice
president, corporate communications, for Federated and
Allied.
   Several apparel manufacturers sounded optimistic about
Federated and Allied's future despite the May results.
   "Everybody is concerned about the losses, but we are
confident that we are going to be paid," said Howard Bloom,
president of Chetta B Inc., a woman's apparel maker. "I've
got the sense that they are straightening themselves out.
They seem to be getting back to the normal way of doing
business -- a sale at the end of the month, not every day."
   Bernard Holtzman, president, Harve Benard Ltd., a women's
apparel maker, said he also believes that Federated and
Allied are showing improvements. "May wasn't a great month
for anybody at retail," said Mr. Holtzman. "Eventually
they'll have a good business again. But they won't be able to
fix all the problems overnight."
   Federated Department Stores consists of Bloomingdale's;
Abraham & Straus; Lazarus, Rich's/Goldsmith's, and Burdines.
Allied Stores consists of Jordan Marsh; Maas/Jordan Marsh
(Florida); Stern's, and The Bon Marche.
   Federated and Allied filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection Jan. 15.
