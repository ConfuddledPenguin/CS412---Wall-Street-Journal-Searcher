   TOKYO -- June sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan
increased 5.6% from a year earlier to 536,731 units, a record
for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association
said.
   Vehicle sales in Japan have posted monthly records for 16
months in a row, supported by strong domestic demand as the
nation's economy continues to expand. First-half sales
totaled a record 3.06 million units, a 13% increase from a
year earlier.
