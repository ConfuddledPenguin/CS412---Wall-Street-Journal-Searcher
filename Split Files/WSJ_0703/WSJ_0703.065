   DALLAS -- Hallwood Realty Corp. said it has created a new
partnership, Hallwood Realty Partners L.P., which will
exchange limited partner interests for outstanding limited
partner interests in 11 partnerships now sponsored by Equitec
Financial Group Inc.
   The exchange, said company officials, will be contingent
on the approval of a majority of the interests held by
investors in each partnership. The newly issued interests are
to be listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol
HRY.

   Equitec, said Hallwood officials, which recently defaulted
on significant debt obligations, believes the exchange is in
the best interests of its investors. Equitec will withdraw as
general partner once the exchange is completed, leaving
Hallwood Realty Partners as indirect owner of 27 properties
appraised at $534.7 million.
   Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. is acting as dealer-manager of
the exchange, which is scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. Aug. 24.
   Hallwood Realty Corp. is a subsidiary of The Hallwood
Group Inc., which engages in a range of merchant-banking
services and specializes in corporate rescue financing. It is
an investor in real estate, oil and gas, specialty
restaurants, retailing and textiles.
