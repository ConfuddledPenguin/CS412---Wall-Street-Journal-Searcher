   MONETT, Mo. -- Jack Henry &amp; Associates Inc. said it and
Allied Capital Corp II ended talks to merge Henry and
Peerless Systems Inc., an Allied affiliate. No reason was
given, and officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   Henry said it does not intend to pursue a sale, merger or
business combination with other parties. This past February,
the data-processing systems concern had said it would
evaluate unsolicited acquisition inquiries.
