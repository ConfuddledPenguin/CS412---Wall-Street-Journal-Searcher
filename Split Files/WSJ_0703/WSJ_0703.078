   NEW YORK -- Forstmann Little &amp; Co. said it plans a $1.42
billion leveraged buy-out of General Instrument Corp., a
cable TV equipment maker, in what would be Forstmann's second
big acquisition of the year.
   Investors, however, were betting yesterday that another
corporation in the telecommunications industry may try to top
the $44.50-a-share Forstmann offer.

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
General Instrument stock surged $8.875 a share to $45.125.
Trading volume was a heavy 3.3 million shares, more than 10%
of the company's shares outstanding. Counting options that
will be converted in the purchase, General Instrument has
more than 32 million shares.
   Forstmann, which avoided the high-priced acquisitions of
the late 1980s that have caused its competitors some
indigestion, has had the buy-out field almost all to itself
in 1990.
   The reason is that while other buy-out firms depend for
financing on the now-wobbly market for high-risk, high-yield
"junk" bonds, Forstmann can tap its own fund of subordinated
debt to bid for companies.
   "Now, with none of that phony money around, you get back
to the real-money people. We have a real edge," said Theodore
Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann, Little. "We've never
had a deal that didn't work, never ever. We've never had a
restructuring ever," he said.
   Earlier this year, the Forstmann firm acquired the
Gulfstream business aircraft maker from Chrysler Corp. for
$825 million. The year's only other major leveraged buy-out
has been the $1.5 billion purchase of Saks Fifth Avenue by
Investcorp, which represents Middle Eastern investors. An
earnings slump at Saks, however, may signal bad news for the
investors.
   But it is "fairly likely" that its bid for General
Instrument will be topped, says Robert Anderson, a technology
analyst at Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc. If General
Instrument accepts a higher bid, the company promised to pay
Forstmann Little a fee of $33 million, or about $1 a share.
   Analysts said potential bidders range from foreign
companies such as Matsushita Electric Industrial or Philips
N.V. to U.S. telecommunications concerns such as GTE Corp.,
Alltel Corp., or Southern New England Telecommunications
Corp. Bidders have until the offer closes Aug. 13 to top it.
   Harry Rosenthal, a telecommunications analyst at Deutsche
Bank Capital Corp., said the price is at the "low end" of the
$45 to $60-a-share range that he believes the company's
businesses are worth. He said General Instrument has 55% of
the market for cable TV components.
   Mr. Forstmann said he plans to try to expand the cable TV
equipment business internationally, and wouldn't rule out
selling the company's other two businesses, wagering
equipment and semiconductors. He estimated the chances he
will be outbid are only "one in 50."
   Mr. Forstmann said cable TV companies will have to spend
heavily on the kind of boxes and cable sold by General
Instrument to provide the kind of service that regulators
will demand as cable TV becomes more like a utility.
   General Instrument was assembled in the 1960s and 1970s by
Moses Shapiro, who served as the firm's chairman until 1975
and who died March 19. The business was shaped and stabilized
by his successor, Frank V. Hickey, 62 years old.
   Mr. Hickey wasn't available for comment beyond a
one-paragraph statement that he believes the offer provides
"excellent value" for shareholders and "new opportunities"
for the company. Mr. Forstmann said there aren't any
agreements to retain General Instrument executives following
an acquisition, but he expects to offer them a stake in the
company.
   Forstmann was advised on the buy-out by the securities
firms of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and the
law firm of Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson. General
Instrument was advised by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Cleary
Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton.
   Victor Lewkow, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer who
advised General Instrument, said the company elected not to
put itself up for bids before announcing the agreement with
Forstmann Little. He said Mr. Forstmann had refused to
participate in an auction, and that in any case "there have
been auctions where nobody came or the bids were
significantly lower than expected."
   "People with real money are not interested in auctions,"
Mr. Forstmann said. "They say, `You want to have an auction,
go to Sotheby's.'"
   Mr. Forstmann said he plans to finance the purchase with
$800 million in funds from his own investors, counting
roughly $200 million of equity and $600 million of
subordinated debt. He said the balance of the purchase price,
roughly $1 billion including fees and expenses, would be
raised by banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and
Continental Illinois Corp.
   Mr. Forstmann said the purchase will reduce the size of
his buy-out funds to about $1.5 billion, and indicated he may
try to raise more funds to increase that total later this
year. He said investors in his firm's equity and subordinated
debt funds received annual returns exceeding 50% in the
1980s.
   Despite Mr. Forstmann's claim of no restructurings, the
firm did put extra equity into FL Industries Inc. two years
ago. Mr. Forstmann said, however, that the move didn't
constitute a restructuring because his investors had already
received a larger dividend equal to five times their original
investment.
