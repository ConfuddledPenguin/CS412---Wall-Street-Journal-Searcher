   NEW YORK -- The dollar sank and commodities prices rose, a
combination that often weakens U.S. financial markets. But
stocks rose and bonds held even in thin, pre-holiday
activity.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.57 points to
close at 2899.26. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices
finished unchanged.

   Adding to the expectation of lower bond prices was a
stronger-than-expected gain in the Purchasing Managers Index,
an indicator of activity in the economy's industrial sector.
Any signs of economic strength have been bearish for bonds
lately because the Federal Reserve would be less likely to
lower interest rates.
   Higher commodities prices also can hurt bonds, because
they suggest higher inflation, which undercuts the value of
bond yields. Soybeans and some precious metals were among
commodity-price gainers, but crude oil prices fell.
   "I thought bonds would trade off a bit more on the PMI
report," said Michael H. Sherman, investment strategist at
Shearson Lehman Hutton. Anyone expecting the Fed to ease
interest rates soon would have to have second thoughts after
that report, he said.
   Several analysts said the low volume of trading in the
stock market made yesterday's advance in the industrial
average suspect. "It's a very light week, and movements are
being exaggerated," said James Awad, president of BMI
Capital.
   The only major burst of activity came on buy programs --
in which stock-index futures are sold and baskets of the
underlying stocks are purchased to profit on brief price
discrepancies between the two markets.
   Helping buoy prices, Mr. Awad said, was renewed interest
in takeover possibilities in the wake of news that General
Instrument Corp. is being taken private by a leveraged
buy-out led by Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   "People are saying maybe LBOs are finished," Mr. Awad
said, "but all-cash strategic acquisitions of companies --
many of them undervalued -- should provide positive support
in the market."
   But if the dollar continues weakening and commodities
prices keep climbing, the stock market could feel the pinch
soon, said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis
group at Salomon Brothers. "There may be consequences for
stocks and bonds after we return from the holiday," he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on light volume of 130.2 million shares
in New York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues edged
out decliners, 775 to 744.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.40%.
