   CHICAGO -- The price of soybeans jumped in the U.S. amid
forecasts that the intense heat in the Southwest is heading
east toward crops in the Mississippi Delta and Midwest.
   During the session the price of some soybean contracts
rose by their daily limit of 30 cents a bushel. Profit-taking
late in the session trimmed gains. Nevertheless, the wild
rally signals just how skittish the grain industry is getting
about prospects for the soybean crop.

   Most crop analysts don't foresee that much damage from
this heat wave, which might last for roughly a week in the
important soybean-growing areas of the delta. The soybean
crop there doesn't reach its vulnerable flowering stage for
many weeks. The unusually wet spring gave much of the U.S.
crop ample -- if not excessive -- soil moisture on which to
draw.
   But analysts are edgy because the government surprised
them last week when it lowered its three-month-old estimate
of planted soybean acreage by 1.4 million acres to 58 million
acres. Most analysts had thought the government was going to
raise its estimate.
   "I don't think the weather will be that much of a
problem," said Steve Freed, senior grain analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds, Chicago. "But we have low acres and stout
demand" for soybeans.
   At the same time, the spate of hot weather is rekindling
interest in forecasts by a few private meteorologists that
the soupy spring will be followed by a hot and dry summer.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday the
soybean contract for July delivery rose 22.5 cents a bushel
to settle at $6.46 a bushel.
   The prices of corn futures contracts rose slightly to
touch new life-of-contract highs during part of the trading
session. Hot weather is expected to brush the Midwest for a
few days. Temperatures in parts of Iowa, for example, are
expected to approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit today.
   After the close of trading, the National Weather Service
released a six- to 10-day forecast calling for above-normal
temperatures throughout much of the Midwest.
   Crop condition reports released by the major farm states
late yesterday show that the corn and soybean crops are in
relatively good condition despite the cool and wet planting
season.
   In Iowa, 60% of the soybean crop is in excellent or good
condition and 65% of the corn crop falls in that category.

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices hit new session lows in
late trading yesterday and closed lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in light trading. Oil futures traders
focused on the hour-to-hour developments of the strike by
4,000 of Norway's oil workers that began late Saturday and
shut down Norway's total crude oil output of 1,630,000
barrels a day. The market opened higher on the chance that
strikers might ignore the government's forced arbitration
order. But the market fell as the government called on the
strikers to return to their jobs. The Norwegian Federation of
Oil Workers Union central committee advised 4,000 striking
workers to return to work because arbitration ordered by the
government earlier yesterday is legally binding. After
futures trading ended, the Norwegian oil workers' union
disclosed that most of the workers won't obey the
back-to-work order and that wildcat strikes are widespread.
"We have lost control of our members. Production in the North
Sea is completely stopped," said a union official, according
to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. In some cases,
he said, the workers have blocked helicopter landing pads
with cranes so new crews can't land. If the stoppages
continue, prices are expected to rise today. Analysts
caution, however, that it would take an extended strike to
whittle down global inventory levels, which are currently at
an eight-year high.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Prices closed strong with the October contract
ending 0.49 cent higher at 13.26 cents a pound. Sandra Kaul,
tropical commodities analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New
York, said that Cargill Inc.'s taking delivery of more than
400,000 tons of sugar on Friday showed that interest in the
physical market was more intense than had been perceived
earlier. "There is some feeling in the trade that Cargill
might have done a deal with the Soviets for sugar," she
noted. Ms. Kaul also said that there isn't much sugar
currently available, but there is plenty of uncertainty in
Brazil concerning their export targets. She said Pakistan,
Jordan and Syria have all announced that they will be coming
into the market soon to buy white, or refined, sugar. She
said tight supplies of white sugar will start influencing
raw-sugar prices. Harry Schwartz, commodities specialist at
Cargill Investors Services, said he believes this rally has
limited potential. "When prices get over 15 cents again I
believe that we will begin to lose" some sales in the
physical market, as happened earlier this year.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices rose. The September contract gained
$63 a ton to $1,309, $8 off the day's high. Mr. Schwartz of
Cargill Investors Services said yesterday's price action was
puzzling to him because the Ivory Coast has been receiving
moisture at close to normal levels, and because summer is
usually cocoa's slack period. "I have to believe that this is
nothing more than a technical rally," he said. Ms. Kaul from
Shearson disagreed. She noted that chocolate manufacturers
have established a large number of long hedges -- that is,
they bought cocoa for future delivery between $1,000 and
$1,200 a ton -- which in effect has established a band of
support for the market. Ms. Kaul also noted, "There are
perceptions that the French will reduce their commitment to
West Africa, the major cocoa growing region of the world,
because of easing fears about the spread of world communism."
She said such a perception could cause the cocoa industry to
worry about political stability in the area. In addition, the
fungus witches' broom has been spotted in Bahia, the largest
cocoa-producing region in Brazil, the world's second largest
producer after the Ivory Coast. Ms. Kaul says this fungus
devastated cocoa production in the Amazon region of Brazil in
the 1950s. The country has taken many steps to ensure that
the disease didn't spread, but apparently didn't completely
succeed. Ms. Kaul said there is no known cure for the fungus.
She said the market could see the first effects of the
disease on the main Brazilian crop, which will begin to be
harvested in October.
