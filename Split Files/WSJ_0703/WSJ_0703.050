   DALLAS -- In its ongoing efforts to keep a proposed rescue
by Japanese investors alive, debt-burdened Southland Corp.
announced details of a revised debt exchange offer and a
1-for-10 reverse stock split.
   The plan's broad outline was announced June 14. Details of
the plan, including the stock split occurring immediately
before the completion of the debt offer, were outlined in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the
7-Eleven convenience-store operator.

   As previously reported, under the revised offer,
bondholders would receive debt securities totaling about $550
million bearing cash interest rates of 12% to 14% and having
maturities of seven years or less. In addition, bondholders
and preferred shareholders will be offered about 18 1/2% of
Southland's common stock in the exchange offers.
   Bondholders reacted with cautious optimism to the details
of the new proposal. "At first blush, it looks all right,"
said John Gordon of Deltec Securities Corp., who heads a
steering committee of Southland security holders. While
emphasizing that the committee had not endorsed the proposal,
Mr. Gordon said he was hopeful a final agreement could be
negotiated, citing the "good attitude" during recent
discussions between the company, the Japanese investors and
the bondholders.
   The Thompson family, which founded Southland, took the
company private in a $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late
1987. The stock of Southland remains closely held.
   After giving effect to the 1-for-10 reverse stock split,
the revised exchange offer would provide holders of $1,000
principal amount of the company's 13 1/2% senior extendible
reset notes due 1995 with $450 principal amount of 12% senior
notes due 1996 and 37 common shares. Holders of $1,000
principal amount of its 15 3/4% senior subordinated notes due
1997 would get $300 principal amount of 13% first priority
senior subordinated notes due 1997 and 24.5 common shares.
   Holders of $1,000 principal amount of the company's 16
1/2% senior subordinated discount notes due 1997 would
receive $255 principal amount of 13% first priority senior
subordinated notes due 1997 and 21 common shares. Holders of
$1,000 principal amount of its 16 3/4% subordinated
debentures due 2002 would get $200 principal amount of 14%
second priority senior subordinated notes due 1997 and 16.5
common shares.
   Holders of $1,000 principal amount of its 18% junior
subordinated discount debentures due 2007 would get $95
principal amount of 14% second priority senior subordinated
notes due 1997 and eight common shares. Holders of each share
of Southland's 15% cumulative exchangeable preferred stock,
Series One, would receive one common share.
   To reflect the terms of the revised plan, Southland said
it had entered into a new stock-purchase agreement with
Ito-Yokado Co. and Seven-Eleven Japan Co., which have agreed
to buy a 75% stake in Southland for $400 million if the
company can restructure its $1.8 billion in publicly traded
debt. An initial offer to bondholders last March involving
zero-coupon notes with maturities of more than 10 years was
received with hostility.

   JOHN GORDON of Deltec Securities Corp., who heads a
steering committee of Southland Corp. security holders, said
issues remain between security holders and Southland
regarding a revised debt exchange offer by the company. In
Tuesday's edition, Mr. Gordon was quoted as saying he was
favorably impressed by the exchange offer's details. Mr.
Gordon said his comments related only to the relative
allocation of values among various security holder groups and
not to the overall amount being offered by Southland.
