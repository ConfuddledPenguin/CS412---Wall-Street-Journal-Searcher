   CHICAGO -- Morton International Inc. said it sold a 40%
stake in Toray Thiokol Ltd. to Toray Industries Inc., its
Japanese partner in the joint venture, for about $30 million.
   The maker of specialty chemicals and salt said it expects
to report a gain of about $13 million, or 27 cents a share,
on the sale. The move reduces Morton's holding in the venture
to 5%. Morton's ownership of the Toray Thiokol stake dates to
1969, when the U.S. company was known as Thiokol Corp.; the
company now known as Morton International was spun off by
Thiokol Corp. in 1989.

   A spokeswoman said the sale followed an "economic and
strategic assessment" of the operation, and added that there
are "no current plans" to sell the remaining 5% holding.
   Morton also said it will record provisions totaling about
$7 million, reducing earnings about 15 cents a share, "for
additional anticipated costs related primarily to previously
divested operations and to last year's separation from
Thiokol Corp."
   Both the sale and establishment of the partly offsetting
provisions occurred in the fourth quarter ended Saturday;
Morton said its earlier earnings projection of $2.60 to $2.80
a share for the fiscal year just ended didn't include the
effect of either action. Taken together, the two moves would
have an indicated net effect of boosting earnings about 12
cents a share and moving the projection's range to
$2.72-$2.92 a share. The spokeswoman said the original range
for its operating results still holds, exclusive of the
unusual items.
   In the first nine months, net income was $98.5 million, or
$2.05 a share, on sales of $1.21 billion.
