   JACKPOT ENTERPRISES Inc. raised the quarterly to eight
cents from seven cents and declared a 5% stock dividend, both
payable July 31 to stock of record July 17. The Las Vegas,
Nev., operator of slot machines said the shares distributed
as a stock dividend will not receive the cash dividend. The
stock dividend will reduce the conversion price of Jackpot's
$34.5 million of 8.75% convertible subordinated debentures
due May 1, 2014, to $14.74 a share from $15.14 effective July
17. Separately, Bristol Holdings Inc., also of Las Vegas,
authorized a special dividend of one Jackpot common share for
every 200 shares of Bristol common stock, payable July 31 to
stock of record July 18. The dividend is expected to involve
about 17,000 Jackpot shares, which will reduce Bristol's
stake in Jackpot to about 4.5%.
