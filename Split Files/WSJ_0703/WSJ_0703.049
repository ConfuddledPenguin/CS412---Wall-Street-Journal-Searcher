   TORONTO -- Cineplex Odeon Corp. said it has agreed to sell
its interest in the 18-screen Universal City Cinemas of
Universal City, Calif., to a unit of MCA Inc. for $45
million.
   Cineplex said one of its subsidiaries will be retained to
manage the theater on a long-term basis. It said the purchase
price is subject to post-closing adjustments, which aren't
expected to be material. Expected to close in the third
quarter of 1990, the transaction is also subject to U.S.
regulatory approval and to other conditions.

   Cineplex, a large entertainment concern based in Toronto,
said proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt.
   Cineplex added that, under terms of the sale agreement, it
may accept within 60 days a higher bid for its interest in
the theater. MCA will then have the option of matching the
competing offer.
   MCA, based in Universal City, Calif., is a major
shareholder in Cineplex, which said the transaction was
negotiated by a special committee of directors independent of
MCA.
