   WASHINGTON -- America's foreign debt swelled again last
year, further miring the nation in its rank of the world's
largest debtor.
   During the year, foreign holdings in the U.S. grew nearly
twice as much as U.S. holdings abroad, the Commerce
Department said. As a result, the U.S. was left shouldering a
net debt burden -- the difference between U.S. holdings
abroad and foreigners' holdings here -- of $663.75 billion.
That was nearly 25% higher than the nation's $531.08 billion
net debt position in 1988.

   The report was the latest chapter in America's stunning
decline from the world's largest creditor nation in 1983 to
the world's largest debtor nation.
   A continued surge in foreign investment in everything from
New York office towers to Treasury securities to entire U.S.
companies, hoisted foreigners' assets in the U.S. to $2.076
trillion last year from $1.797 trillion in 1988. That swamped
the growth in U.S. investment abroad, which lifted U.S.
foreign assets to $1.413 trillion from $1.266 trillion in
1988.
   Not only was the report grim news for the U.S. government,
but it also brought some embarrassing chiding of the Commerce
Department. For the first time, the department decided not to
publish the bottom-line debtor position of the U.S. -- the
$663.75 billion figure -- in its report on international
investment, although it provided enough information to
calculate the number.
   In a statement accompanying the report, the department
explained that the comparison of the values of foreign assets
in the U.S. and U.S. assets abroad was imprecise since it
mixed current prices of assets with prices paid when they
were purchased. The result, according to the department, was
that U.S. assets, many of which were purchased decades ago,
were generally undervalued compared with foreign assets, the
bulk of which were purchased in the 1980s.
   But critics accused the government of trying to paper over
a dreadful number. "Any decision not to print a bottom line,
I think, is masking a net position and a trend that is
indisputably very adverse," said C. Fred Bergsten, director
of the Institute for International Economics here.
   Mr. Bergsten, who is writing a book on America's debtor
status, did agree that "there are big problems with the
numbers." But he said the numbers may understate U.S.
liabilities as well as assets. "My conclusion is that the net
bottom line is not too inaccurate, and certainly the trend of
the last 10 years is indisputable," he said.
   Allan Young, head of the Commerce Department's Bureau of
Economic Analysis, which compiled the report, said the
department's decision not to print the number was part of a
government-wide effort to improve the quality of economic
statistics. "No other considerations entered into it," Mr.
Young said. "It's simply that we didn't think it was an
accurate number." By this time next year, he said, the
department aims to publish a report valuing all international
investment at current prices.
