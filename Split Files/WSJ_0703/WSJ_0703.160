   NEW YORK -- The dollar declined again, continuing a
pattern that some traders think will be as hard to shake as
summer cold.
   For several weeks, traders have predicted the dollar's
drop against the yen and the high-yielding currencies of
Britain, Australia and Canada. But yesterday they were
surprised by the strength of the mark, which they largely
credited to the smooth currency unification between East and
West Germany over the weekend.

   "This dollar is the `unidollar,' the unification dollar,"
said Liliana Nealon, a first vice president at Union Bank of
Switzerland in New York. "There was a lot of pent-up demand
for deutsche marks from corporations and institutional
investors who had held off buying until the monetary
unification actually took place to make sure it went without
a hitch."
   In late New York trading, the dollar stood near its
intraday lows at 1.6505 marks and 150.83 yen, compared with
1.6610 marks and 152.20 yen before the weekend.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading
at 151.68 yen; it closed Monday in Tokyo at 151.40 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6558
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6534 marks.
   Meanwhile, the British pound was in a class by itself
Monday, soaring to $1.7770 from $1.7485 late Friday on a
statement by German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl that
he expects the pound to join the exchange-rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System "soon." The EMS is a joint float
of nine European currencies.
   Many analysts had expected the dollar to strengthen
against the mark after East Germany's adoption of the West
German currency Sunday. They had visions of East Germans,
flush with the buying power of one of the world's most
respected currencies, going on a spending binge for Western
goods they could never before afford.
   Instead, the exchange of billions of East German marks, or
ostmarks, for West Germany's deutsche marks went smoothly.
And yesterday, on the first shopping day of the new currency
era, East Germans did buy color televisions, computers and
video recorders -- but they didn't spend like drunken sailors
on leave.
   The dollar has receded steadily over the past few weeks as
international investors and speculators have been lured to
higher and rising interest rates abroad. In the past week
alone, the dollar has fallen nearly 3% against the yen and
about half that much against the mark.
   Three-month Eurodollar deposits currently yield 8.25%, the
same as their German equivalent and only a little more than
the 7.625% returns available on three-month Euroyen deposits.
   Those high rates outside the U.S. have given investors
second thoughts about taking on the currency risks of
dollar-denominated securities. Japanese investors purchased a
net $4.9 billion of foreign bonds in May and $624 million of
foreign stocks. Those represented large increases from a
month earlier but were still far less than they bought a year
ago. Not all those purchases were dollar-denominated
securities, but analysts assume that most were.
   "Last year, a lot of Japanese investors were investing in
the U.S., but this year that tendency is slowing down," said
Yoneo Sakai, joint general manager in charge of treasury
operations for Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. "The U.S. economy
is slowing down, and there is still a possibility for easing
U.S. monetary policy."
   Some traders pointed to President Bush's confirmation last
week that his administration would be willing to consider tax
increases to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. A narrower
deficit, they said, could lead to smaller government
borrowing requirements and lower U.S. interest rates.
   "The market as a whole is expecting a decrease in U.S.
interest rates," said Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief trader at Sanwa
Bank Ltd. in New York. "If U.S. interest rates actually
decrease, then the market will sell dollars. But if it
doesn't occur, we'll see a lot of dollar buying interest at
the low 150yen level from trust banks and insurance
companies. It all depends on U.S. interest rates."
   At the same time, some analysts expect the Bank of Japan
to eventually raise its official discount rate to dampen what
they say is high monetary growth in Japan. Lately, the market
has been jostled by rumors to that effect, but Mr. Sakaguchi
said that if it happens, "I don't think it will occur
immediately." Higher Japanese rates would increase the yen's
attraction to international investors.
   Also boosting the yen yesterday were news reports that the
U.S.'s undersecretary of state for economic and agricultural
affairs, Richard T. McCormack, said the Group of Seven major
industrial nations are concerned about the Japanese
currency's depreciation over the last year, especially
because it will help boost Japanese exports.
   Heads of state from the seven countries -- the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- are
scheduled to attend an annual economic summit in Houston
beginning next Monday.
   That meeting plus Friday's scheduled release of U.S.
employment data for June have some traders on edge. Few are
willing to place big bets either for or against the dollar,
especially with trading this week expected to be thin because
of tomorrow's Independence Day holiday in the U.S. A fall in
U.S. employment could signal an even weaker economy and
prompt interest rates to decline further.
   "The market mentality right now is very much in favor of
the deutsche mark because of the future outlook for the
German economy and because of the East European situation,"
said Klaus Schuermann, a vice president at CSFB Effectenbank
AG in Frankfurt. "I personally would be more favorable for
the dollar, but you have people talking lower interest rates
in the U.S. You can't say with confidence whether the dollar
will be much higher or much lower in the short period."
   Meanwhile, apart from Mr. Poehl's remarks, the pound is
being propelled by the sky-high interest rates that Britain
is using to combat inflation. High rates are also buoying the
Australian and Canadian dollars. Three-month Eurosterling
rates currently stand at 14.875%, while three-month domestic
deposit rates for the Australian and Canadian currencies are
15.06% and 13.6%, respectively.
   Nonetheless, analysts say the U.S. dollar isn't without
its strengths. "The Bush administration is strong," said Mr.
Sakai of Fuji Bank. By contrast, he said, Japan's Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu is a bit "shaky" because "he's quite
young and the older people are still watching his actions and
performance."
   Although the Japanese prime minister is committed to
instituting electoral reform sometime in September or
October, Mr. Sakai said, "many people doubt he can do it."
   Another, and in many ways more important, plus for the
dollar -- especially against the mark -- is the potential for
growing unrest in the Soviet Union. International investors
usually flee to the dollar during periods of tension. And the
mark, in particular, is often vulnerable to turmoil in
Eastern Europe because of Germany's proximity to the region
and its large trade links to it.
   But barring sudden negative developments in those areas,
Ms. Nealon of UBS said that over the next couple of weeks the
U.S. currency could fall to 1.60 or 1.62 marks and 145 to 148
yen.
   She also still likes the high-yielding British, Canadian
and Australian currencies. While they might give up some
advantage, Ms. Nealon said, "It's very, very costly to short
these currencies."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $358.80 an ounce, up 90 cents. Estimated
volume was a light 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $357.95 an
ounce.
