   DALLAS -- Comstock Resources Inc. said it has signed a
letter of intent to enter into a gas purchase contract with
Maple Gas Corp.
   The agreement will require Maple to spend at least $20
million for pipeline gathering facilities, and a gas
processing plant capable of accepting all casing head gas
production from Comstock's leases in four Texas counties. All
casing head gas from the Comstock properties will be
dedicated to Maple for 15 years.
