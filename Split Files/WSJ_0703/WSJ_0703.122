   Foremost Corp. of America, Grand Rapids, Mich., said it
had ended a five-month search for a buyer for the company.
   "We have proceeded diligently over the past five months in
identifying and contacting potential purchasers," said
Richard L. Antonini, Foremost's president and chief executive
officer. "Our efforts, however, have been unsuccessful and,
accordingly, the board has determined that it is not in the
best interests of the company and its stockholders to
continue to explore a possible sale."
