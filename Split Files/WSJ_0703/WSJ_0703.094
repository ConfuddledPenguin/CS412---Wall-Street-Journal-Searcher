   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Hercules Inc. said its chairman and
chief executive officer, David S. Hollingsworth, will retire
in 1991, leaving open the question of who will succeed him.
   Mr. Hollingsworth, 62 years old, will be stepping down
before the mandatory retirement age at Hercules of 65. A
42-year veteran of the chemicals and aerospace company, he
took the top job in March 1987.

   In a memo distributed to Hercules employees yesterday, Mr.
Hollingsworth said he had accepted the chief executive's post
with the understanding that he preferred to stay in the job
for no more than four years.
   The memo made no mention of recent difficulties at the
company, including technical troubles and order delays in its
rocket-booster operations, which led to a charge against
earnings in 1989 of $221.9 million. The charge left the
company with a loss for the year of $81.3 million, or $1.76 a
share, on sales of $3.09 billion.
   Stuart E. Eizenstat, a Washington lawyer who heads the
Hercules board's nominating committee, issued a statement
saying, "While the other members of the board and I may have
wished that David had been willing to remain until age 65, we
respect his wishes as expressed to us at the time of his
selection" as chief executive.
   Hercules didn't give any indication as to whether its
58-year-old president, Fred L. Bruckner, may be favored in
the selection of a successor to Mr. Hollingsworth. Mr.
Eizenstat said there are several candidates within Hercules,
and he suggested that the board will also be looking outside
the company by saying it "does not want to foreclose any
options.'
   The company disclosed Mr. Hollingsworth's plans shortly
before the close of composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, where Hercules shares rose 62.5 cents each to close
at $34.
