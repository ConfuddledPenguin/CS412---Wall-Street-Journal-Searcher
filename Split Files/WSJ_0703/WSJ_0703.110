   Mattel Inc. said it expects to report earnings of about
$19 million, or 38 cents a share, in the second quarter. A
year earlier, the Los Angeles toy maker reported net income
of $16.6 million, or 33 cents a share.
   Second-quarter sales, it's estimated, similarly climbed
16% to about $315 million, vs. $272 million a year earlier,
in the face of a soft retail sales market.

   John W. Amerman, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the results are consistent with the company's
projections of double-digit revenue growth for 1990. Mattel's
stock fell $2.25 to close at $22.125 a share in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading yesteday, as the projections are
somewhat below what many analysts had been expecting.
   Thomas Kully, an analyst with William Blair &amp; Co. in
Chicago, attributed part of the second-quarter softness to
the weakness among large retailers, as well as an increasing
shift to just-in-time inventory. Analysts said Mattel's stock
also was affected by weak performances among its competitors,
such as Hasbro Inc.'s recent announcement of an anticipated
50% drop in second-quarter profit.
