   TOKYO -- Every decade, the powerful Ministry of
International Trade and Industry gazes into its crystal ball
and publishes what it calls a vision of the future. "Warning"
might be a better word.
   Had foreign steel, semiconductor and other industries
viewed the visions of the 1960s, '70s and '80s as economic
war plans, they might have been better prepared for the
struggles they later faced.

   But in its vision for the 1990s, slated for publication
Thursday, MITI calls for nothing less than the dawning of an
industrial Age of Aquarius. New national goals, according to
early drafts, include creation of a "mellow society" for
Japan's elderly and "promoting eating space" in Japanese
homes and restaurants, so that "the dining table will be a
place where you can express yourself."
   The main industries targeted for improvement by the vision
are domestic. They include such unstrategic sectors as
resorts, interior decorating, traditional handicrafts and
fashion (through fashion museums, fashion towns and design
days). The vision also calls for "technoglobalism" --
world-wide sharing of research -- and "harmonizing" Japan's
trade ties.
   "If you look at our report," says one official working on
it, "you might wonder where MITI's industrial policy is."
   Indeed, MITI's professed transformation from driver of
this nation's economic steamroller to dispenser of mellowness
does stir wonder. Amid growing international suspicion of
Japan, "you have to take it {the new vision} as a
public-relations document," says Ezra Vogel, a Harvard
professor and Japanologist, on hearing a summary of the
report. Even one of the authors admits, "We have drafted this
document based on the fact that foreigners will read it."
   Yet for those wondering what Japan will look like in the
year 2000, the real question is not whether MITI is sincere
but whether it -- or anyone else -- can loosen up Japan. For
the 1990s prognostications to turn out as accurately as
MITI's previous forecasts, Japan will have to make changes
far deeper than ever before.
   "I'm skeptical about how strongly MITI will be able to
influence industry," says Naohiro Amaya, a retired MITI aide
and main author of the 1970s vision. "It's simple to say
development of steel is important. But when MITI says quality
of life is very important, it's not so simple."
   Even doubters will pay attention to MITI's new vision,
though, because few bureaucracies anywhere can rival MITI's
track record over the past few decades. MITI emerged after
World War II with a vast arsenal of formal and informal
economic powers, ranging from controlling access to foreign
exchange to proffering "administrative guidance" to
executives. In the early 1960s, for example, MITI forced
International Business Machines Corp. and Texas Instruments
Inc. to license potential Japanese competitors as the price
of setting up shop in Japan.
   Chalmers Johnson, a Japan expert at the University of
California at San Diego, argues in his 1982 book "MITI and
the Japanese Miracle" that the ministry charted Japan's
economic rise and still wields great influence. Others
disagree. They cite such famous MITI flubs as its failed
attempts to block Sony Corp. from acquiring American
transistor technology in 1953 and Honda Motor Co. from
entering the auto business in 1963. They say MITI's main role
was to ratify existing trends.
   But even when MITI followed rather than led, it played an
important bureaucratic role. Its tracts, though far from
Communist-style five-year plans, are much more important than
hands-off macroeconomic forecasts. Work on the 1990s vision
began in the fall of 1988, with help from more than 300
Japanese leaders, including MITI officials and such outsiders
as the chairmen of Sony and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
professors of economics, law, and literature from Tokyo
University and an editorial writer from Japan's leading
economic newspaper.
   MITI isn't just an intellectual middleman. The ministry
helps define a consensus and, by lending its seal of
approval, gives that consensus great weight. Executives
invoke MITI statements to defend investment decisions. Bank
loans often flow into MITI-targeted areas. College students
flock to technologies highlighted by MITI as growth
industries. Specific MITI policies and projects often follow
the general visions.
   The visions give "an orderly frame of reference within
which corporate actors can make a series of their own
decisions," Daniel I. Okimoto, a Stanford political
scientist, wrote last year in "Between MITI and the Market,"
a book largely skeptical about the ministry's current power.
"When economic plans are concrete, industry-specific and
based on a consensus between MITI and industry, they can get
actors in the private and public sectors moving in the same
direction."
   When the vision of the 1960s was published in 1963, Japan
had already bounced back from the war's devastation but still
worried about surviving international competition. MITI
called for concentration on high-growth heavy industries and
chemicals and subsequently fostered those sectors. In steel,
for example, MITI helped coordinate production, investment
and pricing to prevent "excessive competition," eventually
engineering the merger of two large manufacturers into Nippon
Steel. By the end of the decade, Japan had tripled its steel
output and become the world's most efficient producer.
   The next vision, published in 1971, called for a
"knowledge-intensive" economy. Japan was worried about
competition from low-wage developing countries and industrial
pollution. MITI steered its financial machinery-tax breaks
and loans away from heavy industries and toward clean
technologies, while maintaining trade curbs in those
strategic sectors.
   It launched research projects with Japanese electronics
companies in areas such as mainframe computers and
semiconductors. It guaranteed a market for these nascent
industries by buying only domestic products, even though
foreign technology was superior. By the end of 1970s, Japan
had largely pushed America out of consumer electronics, made
major gains in computers and become the technological leader
in basic chips.
   The 1980s vision was more diffuse. It dwelled on what
seemed at the time like a long-term energy crisis. But its
goals included becoming "technology-intensive," on the ground
that Japan must "develop its own technology to serve as a
bargaining power." The report listed many crucial fields,
such as artificial intelligence and new materials, and MITI
subsequently underwrote related research projects. American
trade negotiators also allege that MITI encouraged, or at
least shielded, measures that protected Japan's domestic
technology while wiping out foreign competitors.
   It is too early to judge the success of many of the
advanced research ventures. But as the 1980s ended, Japan had
virtually chased Americans out of the dynamic random access
memory semiconductor business and seemed poised to take a
large chunk of the supercomputer market.
   But something else happened in the 1980s that MITI hadn't
envisioned: The world got angry at Japan. Americans and
Europeans termed its policies unfair, blamed MITI and
threatened to close their markets unless Japan changed. So
one of the ministry's new missions has been to shine up
Japan's image -- and its own.
   MITI officials talk these days like graduates of
re-education camps. They diligently refer to declines in
Japan's trade surplus as "improvement" in the trade picture.
Many Americans fear that Japan is targeting aircraft as its
next great industrial leap, but Shinichiro Ohta, the head of
MITI's aircraft and ordnance division, insists that "we don't
have national goals."
   MITI's face lift has included everything from negotiating
limits on Japanese exports and sharing research money with
foreign companies, down to plastering "Import Now" posters
all over Tokyo's Narita Airport. And now comes the vision of
the 1990s, which essentially declares that the mission of
building up Japan Inc. has been accomplished. Like the KGB,
which is suffering an identity crisis in the Soviet Union,
MITI needs a new task.
   The 1990s report still talks about the health of the
Japanese economy, but focuses on such domestic issues as
dealing with the labor shortage. The vision calls for more
basic, as opposed to commercial, scientific research. The
industrial-policy section calls for consumerism and more
attention to "human values."
   "MITI had great success in making Japan an economic
giant," says Hiroshi Tsukamoto, a 22-year veteran of the
ministry who helped draft a section on "yutori and yutakasa,"
which roughly translates into "comfort and affluence." "But
now the surroundings of Japan are changing, and we have to
have a more balanced relationship between the economy and
individual people's lives."
   Yet MITI hasn't abandoned its traditional role. It still
targets commercial technologies in which Japan lags behind
other countries, such as jet engines, for
government-sponsored research and tax breaks. And it
strenuously resisted U.S. pressure to open up markets ranging
from supercomputers to the retail system.
   "The only thing that is changing is what is needed to
promote Japanese business in the 1990s," says John P. Stern,
who heads the American Electronics Association's Tokyo
office. "Japanese companies are overflowing with capital.
They don't need the West anymore to develop technology. They
need to maintain foreign markets' openness. I see absolutely
no change in MITI's fundamental vision."
   The innocent-sounding vision of the 1990s might appear to
be aimed at doing just that. For the first time, the ministry
plans to release an English-language summary simultaneous
with the Japanese report. The release comes just a week after
the first full report of the Structural Impediments
Initiative, a forum in which the U.S. is urging Japan to
adopt a more mellow economy. In fact, the Japanese
government, in an interim agreement in the SII talks signed
in April, specifically agreed that its "vision" statements
"shall not be used to enhance the competitive position of
particular companies in the Japanese market" and that in
trade-related visions, "the significance of imports shall be
emphasized."
   Yet more and more Americans are convinced that MITI really
is evolving. Some visiting U.S Commerce Department officials
last September praised MITI's helpful role in trade
discussions and criticized the more intransigent Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications. "Some people are going to be
very reluctant to change, but there is a recognition {within
MITI} they've got to open up," a Commerce Department official
said here recently.
   MITI, in fact, has plenty of reasons other than pleasing
Americans for adopting a new look. In Japan's fiercely
competitive bureaucratic wars, MITI's new vision can be read
as a gambit for expanding its turf. Most of the issues
addressed have little to do with MITI's direct
responsibilities. The push for greater public spending, for
example, is a shot across the bow of the tightfisted Ministry
of Finance. The drive to cut labor hours -- reinforced with
yet-another report issued in early June -- nudges into the
Labor Ministry's domain.
   In fact, while MITI and the Americans talk about the same
goals, the proposed means often differ sharply. U.S.
negotiators argue that the source of most economic conflict
is the heavy hand of the Japanese government and that the
solution is deregulation. But MITI's response to most
complaints is a new MITI program.
   Besides, MITI isn't alone in calling for reorientation of
Japan's economy. The 1990s vision will be only the most
prominent in a stream of reports issued since then-Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone commissioned a 1986 report calling
for a laundry list of market-opening and lifestyle-enhancing
measures.
   And just yesterday, Japan's largest trade-union federation
and the federation of employers' associations, in their
first-ever joint report to the government, urged a
reorientation in Japan's industrial structure away from
producers and more toward consumers, according to the Kyodo
news agency.
   But even if MITI, as well as other pockets of Japan's
leadership, really have the will, it isn't clear that they
have the way, or even know the way, to craft such a
transformation. After all, the 1970s vision included a call
for a five-day workweek, and the 1980s vision advocated
"relaxed ease" -- though stressing balance with economic
"vitality." Over that time, Japan's economy has certainly
gained in vitality, but working hours have stayed stuck at
more than 2,100 a year, 10% more than those in any other
industrialized nation.
   One problem, analysts say, is that MITI is advocating
values alien to long-held Japanese practices. "I think there
is a desire on the part of Japanese leaders to avoid
confrontation and friction with the U.S. and other
countries," says Clyde Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade
negotiator who often jousted with MITI. But, "the more
important question is `Do they know how?' . . . If you don't
really have a concept of openness, then how do you get
there?"
   Another potential stumbling block is that MITI, by
championing foreign companies as well as Japanese workers and
consumers, would rile its traditional constituency: Japanese
industry. Is it really able to rein in the giant it helped
create? Some say it is -- but just feigns impotence to
convince Americans further market-changing measures are
impossible.
   Others aren't so sure. "Whenever companies consider {MITI
policies} good for them, they follow," says Makoto Kuroda,
the ministry's recently retired vice minister of
international affairs. "But when MITI says something stupid,
or believed to be contrary to the interests of business,
there is no way to force them."
