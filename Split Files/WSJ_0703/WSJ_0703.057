   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration will
require over-the-counter aspirin products to carry stricter
warnings advising women in the last three months of pregnancy
against using the products unless directed by a physician.
   The agency said the stronger warning on labels is being
required because aspirin can affect fetal circulation and
uterine contraction, which can harm the baby and cause
problems during delivery.

   Aspirin products now carry a general warning that says:
"As with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby,
seek the advice of a health professional before using this
product."
   Manufacturers have one year to add the stronger warning to
all oral and rectal over-the-counter products containing
aspirin, the FDA said.
   The warning reads: "It is especially important not to use
aspirin during the last three months of pregnancy unless
specifically directed to do so by a doctor because it may
cause problems in the newborn child or complications during
delivery."
   An advisory panel of medical experts had recommended the
stronger warning. A similar, third-trimester pregnancy
warning is already required on nonprescription products with
the pain-reliever ibuprofen.
