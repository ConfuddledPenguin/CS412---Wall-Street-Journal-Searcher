   LONDON -- Rupert Murdoch said Sky Television, his
fledgling British satellite-TV service, should break even by
late 1991 or early 1992 after amassing operating losses "in
excess of #300 million. ($524.7 million)"
   While hefty, such losses would be less than the #350
million of red ink Mr. Murdoch envisioned in April. Other
officials of Sky TV, a unit of Mr. Murdoch's News Corp.,
cited the unexpectedly rapid acceptance of its new pay-TV
movie channel.

   "Quite frankly, we underestimated the scale of the {Sky
TV} project," Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Australia-based media concern, told a news
conference here. "The risks were enormous and a lot of
expensive mistakes were made along the way." However, he
added, the Sky TV venture "has worked."
   The four-channel service began beaming TV signals directly
to homes in Britain and Ireland in February 1989, 14 months
ahead of rival British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. Equipment
shortages and customer confusion about the new technology
meant few people watched Sky TV at first.
   The Murdoch venture subsequently gained wider acceptance
last fall largely because it introduced and heavily promoted
a cheap rental subscription package for an initial cost of
#4.45 ($7.78) a week. The package covered installation of
satellite receiving dishes, rental and descrambling equipment
and fees for its pay-TV channel.
