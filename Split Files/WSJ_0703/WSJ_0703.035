   TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus widened to $2.79 billion
for the first 20 days of June, from $2.63 billion in the
year-earlier period, the Ministry of Finance said.
   Exports for the 20-day period rose 4.1% to $14.42 billion,
from $13.85 billion a year ago. Imports rose 3.7% to $11.63
billion from $11.22 billion.

   Japan's trade surplus contracted in May to $3.13 billion
from $3.76 billion in the previous year.
   Forecasting that the surplus will start to expand again
soon, economists stressed in May that the yen's weakening in
foreign-exchange markets was encouraging exports, while
slower growth in the domestic economy was dampening imports.
