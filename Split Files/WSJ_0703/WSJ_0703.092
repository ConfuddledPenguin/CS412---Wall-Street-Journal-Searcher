   Tokyo stock prices finished higher in light trading helped
by index-linked buying by investment trust funds in the
afternoon session.
   Stocks were down a bit in London. But they were broadly
higher at Frankfurt in the wake of the German monetary union
Sunday.

   At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up
219.99 points to close at 32160.23. The index lost 165.95
Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was up
48.50 points to 32208.73.
   Monday's trading remained light, with only 380 million
shares changing hands on the First Section, down from 551.6
million Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues, 520 to 405,
while 195 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which lost 7.04 points Friday, was up
5.34 points, or 0.23%, at 2348.70.
   The Second Section index, which gained 22.19 points
Friday, was down 10.91 points, or 0.26%, to close at 4189.90.
Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 18.4 million
shares, down from 28 million Friday.
   The market didn't favor the yen's early advance as it
usually does, as the dollar fell below 152 yen at the open in
Tokyo Monday, and stock prices remained at lower levels
during the morning session.
   Expectations for higher domestic interest rates have been
growing, together with uncertainty about foreign interest
rates, following the German economic union Sunday, traders
said.
   The yen's strength wasn't good news to the market because
it brought on expectations for higher Japanese interest
rates, traders said.
   After finishing the morning session with a 96-point loss,
however, the Nikkei index gradually rose during the
afternoon.
   Stock prices went up, largely helped by buying by
investment trust funds and minor arbitrage buying in the
afternoon, traders said. Also, a slight recovery of bond
prices in the afternoon prompted some buying, they said.
   "But investors in general hesitated to buy," said Shigeru
Akiba of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   As reflected on the low trade volume, investors'
participation was sluggish.
   In addition to continuing speculation about an official
discount rate boost by the Bank of Japan, investors have a
number of excuses to remain on the sidelines, said a trader
at Yamaichi Securities. They include the Soviet Communist
Party conference and U.S. Federal Open Market Committee
meeting, both beginning Monday, as well as U.S. jobless rate
data to be issued Friday, the trader said.
   Fanuc and Kyocera, which led advances in the morning
session, declined toward the end of the day along with other
high-technology issues that advanced strongly last week.
Fanuc was at 7,550 yen ($49.65), down 80 yen, while Kyocera
ended at 8,900 yen, up 10.
   Sony dropped 220 to 8,860 and TDK lost 100 to 7,400.
   The focus of buying Monday afternoon shifted to domestic
shares, with stocks related to public spending setting the
pace of advances.
   Shares of general construction companies, road building
companies, makers of construction-related equipment and home
builders rose as these companies are expected to benefit from
expanded public spending, traders said. The Japanese
government pledged to spend a total of 430 trillion yen on
public works over the next 10 years as part of the Structural
Impediment Initiative talks with the U.S. last week.
   London share prices recovered ground at the close of light
trading, helped by a moderately healthy performance by Wall
Street shares and bargain-hunting among London players.
   After the market hit bottom at midafternoon, when the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-index was off 6.4 points,
some players took the opportunity to pick up stock at lower
levels. When Wall Street started firming, buying interest at
London accelerated.
   "People didn't foresee a further imminent fall," commented
one dealer.
   However, volume was very light, with 309.4 million shares
traded by the close, compared with 461.9 million Friday.
   The FT-SE 100-share index closed down 2.6 points at
2372.0.
   The narrower FT 30-share index was down 3.3 points, at
1896.6, at the close. In the futures markets, the September
FT-SE 100 index contract ended at 2441.0, down from its close
of 2446.0 Friday.
   Dealers expect volume to remain depressed throughout the
week, with the U.S. market closed for a public holiday
tomorrow.
   "London isn't under any pressure. There's a buyers' strike
and no economic news," said one dealer.
   Stocks to show hefty gains included Glaxo, up 16 pence (28
cents) at 834 on weekend newspaper reports that it will
profit handsomely from sales of its new asthma drug in the
U.S. However, most of the buying interest was from the U.S.
as London players don't rate the drug's prospects as highly.
   Reuters was up 5 pence at #12.65 pence ($22.13), on
unconfirmed weekend media reports that the company may soon
make an acquisition.
   Some oil stocks initially benefited from anticipation of a
strike in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. That strike
was averted later Monday after negotiations led to an
agreement.
   Enterprise was among the few stocks to retain its initial
gains, ending up 4 pence at 634.
   Prices of shares on the Frankfurt exchange rose broadly as
it became apparent that East Germans haven't engaged in a
spending spree since German monetary union took effect
Sunday.
   The weighted German Stock Index, or DAX, advanced 1.9%
from the previous close to 1915.30. Gains were spread across
the board, led by the blue chips.
   Dealers said the smooth start to monetary union calmed
some recent worries in the market about a rush by East
Germans to spend their new marks on consumer goods.
   Concern over the possible inflationary impact of
unification and investor worry about the stability of the
mark have led to widely fluctuating stock market prices and
weakness in West German bond markets in recent months.
   But amid more confidence about monetary union, West German
institutional investors were buying stock, with modest
foreign purchases also recorded, dealers said.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Madrid, lower in
Paris, Zurich and Milan and were mixed in Stockholm, Brussels
and Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed marginally
higher.
   Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Wellington and
Seoul and were lower in Sydney, Singapore and Manila. Taipei
was closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
