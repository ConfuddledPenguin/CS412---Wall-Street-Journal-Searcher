   MANAGERS AIM HIGHER than a decade ago. But they also want
out earlier.
   Half the top managers below chief executive at major
corporations aspire to be CEOs or own their own firms, up
from a third who shared the ambition 10 years ago. Yet a
survey by Korn/Ferry International and UCLA's Anderson
Graduate School of Management shows that 91% of the
executives would retire early, up from 82%; only 10% would
work as long as possible, down from 17%, and 63% would
continue working if financially independent, off from 68%.

   "Today's executives are more ambitious and less satisfied
than their counterparts 10 years ago," says Lester Korn,
chairman of the recruiting company. Only 48% would choose the
same career if they were starting over, down from 60% who
would have walked the same path a decade ago. The executives,
moreover, contend they would like to spend more time with
their children and less time traveling and in school. Yet
they still maintain a grueling pace.
   The managers put in an average 56 hours at work each week,
up three hours in 10 years.
                                                                                                       

   BUSINESS JITTERS keep many executives close to desks this
summer.
   When Stephen Pistner took over as chief executive of
troubled Ames Department Stores, he told senior managers "I'm
going to ruin your summer but save your future." So neither
Mr. Pistner nor Douglas Ewing, a vice president who recalls
the incident, are planning breaks this year. Nor is Fred
Carr, First Executive Corp.'s CEO, who has been busily
defending the firm's investment strategy. He isn't "opposed"
to vacations, he says. He just doesn't have time.
   John Teets, chairman of Greyhound Dial Corp., is getting
away for 10 days in August to "count waves" in Maui. Still,
he'll take along a portable fax to keep in touch. But Jack
Snyder, a group vice president of Ball Corp., plans a
Minnesota canoe trip that will keep him out of contact with
his business world. Similarly, Peter Churm, CEO of Furon Co.,
has set a two-week fishing expedition in British Columbia,
arguing "no one person is essential to the operation of any
company, no matter what he says."
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIVE COMP: Even those awarding pay aren't sure
they're doing right.
   Chairmen of compensation committees at major corporations
-- outside directors who generally run other companies --
overwhelmingly believe that "shareholder interests should be
linked to executive compensation." But a survey by Hay Group,
a consulting firm, finds only one-third of the chairmen
"strongly agree" their companies are doing a "good job" of
linking the two.
   They aren't necessarily compatible, suggests Ira Kay, a
Hay senior vice president. The compensation chairmen believe
that executives view base salary as the most important part
of their pay while shareholders may be served best by
long-term incentives that tie pay to stock values. Hay says
base pay accounts for 38% of a CEO's compensation; long-term
incentives bring in 27%. Bonuses are 22% and benefits 13%.
   Protecting share owners may require firms to put more
weight on the longterm component, Mr. Kay suggests.
                                                                                                       

   THE BITE IS BIGGER. Nearly half the employers who have
figured up the cost of retiree health coverage find their
liability is larger than anticipated, consultant Foster
Higgins says. Only 7% find the bill is less.
                                                                                                       

   ILLITERACY CREEPS IN. People who can't read or handle
numbers are hired for jobs that don't require the basic
skills. They become problems when given new duties, say the
Society for Human Resource Management and Commerce Clearing
House.
                                                                                                       

   COMMITMENT FADES. Only 43% of the workers with less than a
year on the job view their companies as "more than just a
place to work." And even that rate slips to 32% after five
years, Wyatt Co. says.
                                                                                                       

   SOMEBODY'S GOT a big office. The Building Owners and
Managers Association International says the average office
worker has 266 square feet of personal space.
                                                                                                       

   GUARDING HENHOUSE means making sure the fox doesn't apply.
   At Barton Protective Services Inc. in Louisiana, screening
begins on the telephone; applicants are put on hold to hear
the company's drug-free policy. Then come a questionnaire,
two interviews, credit checks, psychological and drug tests,
police screening and 32 hours of training. ExecuTech Inc.,
Denver, checks police files and puts applicants through 40
hours of school. Armed guards get special training. Epic
Security in New York says its screening process winnows out
24 of 25 applicants.
   But industry officials say problems persist, if at other
firms, not their own. "You've got convicted felons who work
as trusted security guards for months before their records
are discovered," asserts Ira Lipman, president of Guardsmark
Inc., Memphis. Robert Trotta of T&amp;M Security Service in New
York says he routinely sends applicant fingerprints to state
officials but sometimes never gets a response. So he hires
retired and off-duty law-enforcement officers.
   San Francisco Security Services complains California
limits how applicants can be questioned and tested.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: If they don't know? Nearly 60% of Harvard
undergraduates believe they don't know themselves well enough
to make career decisions, Rabb Planning Center says. . . .
But about housing: Summer interns seeking rentals in New York
reject the "status-conscious life style" of the past for
"more austere, socially conscious" dwellings, Spencer Realty
says.
