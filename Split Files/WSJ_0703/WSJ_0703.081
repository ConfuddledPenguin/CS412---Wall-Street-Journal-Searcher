   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp., emboldened by
its copyright victory against a small software company, is
now waging battle against more formidable rivals.
   Lotus filed suit against California-based Borland
International Inc., claiming that Borland's upstart Quattro
software infringes on the copyright of Lotus's best-selling
1-2-3 spreadsheet.

   The suit, which includes a similar complaint against Santa
Cruz Operation Inc., another California software maker, comes
on the heels of Lotus's copyright infringement victory last
week over Paperback Software International.
   Legal experts say that last week's decision, while not
ensuring future success in court, has strengthened Lotus's
position. "Lotus is now in an extremely powerful position to
enforce its copyright against Borland and others," says Lee
Gesmer, a partner at the law firm of Lucash, Gesmer &amp;
Updegrove, a specialist in copyright law.
   Regardless of what happens, Lotus's aggressive posture
could deter other potential rivals from trying to invade its
turf.
   Borland and Quattro Pro were obvious targets for Lotus's
next legal attack because Quattro has become a hot product.
While Lotus dominates the spreadsheet business with a market
share of about 60%, Borland claims that Quattro Pro is
winning some business from Lotus. In heavy national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, Borland stock plummeted
$4.375, or more than 20%, to close at $17 a share. Lotus's
stock closed at $34.625 a share over the counter, down 12.5
cents.
   "The heart of the case for us is the similarity in menus,"
or screens and keystrokes that the user sees and uses, says
Lotus general counsel Tom Lemberg, noting Lotus's special
interest in Quattro Pro, Borland's latest version of its
Quattro spreadsheet. "Without the Quattro Pro, we wouldn't
have a case."
   In terms of keystrokes, Lotus, for instance, claims that
Quattro Pro's use of the "C" key to denote what type of
currency to use on a spreadsheet, as well as the use of "FR"
for file retrieve, constitute infringements on Lotus's 1-2-3.
   "We believe that the Quattro software is of original
design," responds Borland spokesman Dick O'Donnell, "and if
you ask Quattro users why they use our software, they'll tell
you it's because of the features they get that they can't get
elsewhere."
   Borland has specifically targeted Lotus's 1-2-3 with its
Quattro Pro. Borland sells Quattro Pro for just $99 to owners
of 1-2-3, compared with the normal Quattro Pro price of $495.
   Borland, anticipating Lotus's suit, actually fired the
first shot. Friday, the company filed for a declaratory
judgment in federal court in San Jose, Calif., stating that
Quattro doesn't infringe on Lotus's copyright. Because of
Borland's lightning strike, says Rick Sherlund, an analyst
with Goldman Sachs, the case will most likely proceed in
California rather than before the federal judge in Boston who
ruled in Lotus's favor in the Paperback case. "It was a
shrewd move," says Mr. Sherlund.
   Santa Cruz Operation said the software Lotus has legally
attacked, called SCO Professional, is a spreadsheet package
for a multi-user UNIX operating system. "We haven't seen the
complaint, but, to the best of our knowledge, we haven't
violated any copyrights," said company spokeswoman Janet
Morton. She added that SCO Professional has been selling in
the multi-user arena since 1986, while Lotus only recently
entered the UNIX-spreadsheet market.
   "We have every intention of appealing" last week's
decision, said Michael Burdick, a vice president for
marketing of Paperback Software International of Berkeley,
Calif. "The judge's extending of copyright law to user
interface has created broad adverse effects on the computer
software industry, as is evidenced by the Lotus-Borland suit
just filed. The legal wrangling has already begun."
   The suit underscores how litigious the software industry
has become. Apple Computer Inc., for example, has lawsuits
pending against both Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.,
charging their products infringe on Apple copyrights. Many
small developers of software have decried the trend, claiming
that the lawsuits stifle the creativity and entrepreneurial
spirit that helped build the software industry. But the
companies filing the suits counter that they are simply
protecting their property from competitors who seek to
benefit unfairly by copying unique features.
