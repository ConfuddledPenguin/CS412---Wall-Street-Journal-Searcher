   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc.
said it bought back 500,000 common shares between April 30
and Friday at $4.38 to $7.25 a share.
   The board also authorized the repurchase of as many as one
million common shares on the open market and through private
transactions over the next 12 months. The publisher and
seller of artwork said the buy-back would be funded by
internally generated cash. As of Friday, Martin Lawrence had
7,799,648 common shares outstanding.

   Allen A. Baron, chief financial officer, said the company
expanded the buy-back program because it believes the stock
is a good investment at its current trading levels. The stock
closed yesterday at $4.375 a share, unchanged, in national
over-the-counter trading.
