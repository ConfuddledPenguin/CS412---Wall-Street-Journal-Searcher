   EDISON, N.J. -- Midlantic Corp. said it completed the sale
of its credit card business to Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
for $60 million.
   In addition, Midlantic said it sold $250 million of
securities backed by home equity loans originated by its lead
bank, Midlantic National Bank.

   Both sales are part of Midlantic's efforts to reduce its
asset size and shore up its troubled commercial real estate
loan portfolio. Midlantic has indicated that it expects to
post a "modest" loss for the second quarter.
