   SAN FRANCISCO -- Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. reached
an agreement with the city of San Francisco allowing a
long-stalled $2 billion urban renewal project to begin as
early as next summer.
   The agreement, which still faces a design review by city
planners, appears to end a 37-year squabble over how the
87-acre, city-owned tract south of historic Market Street
should be revitalized. Olympia &amp; York was chosen 10 years ago
as designer and developer. Talks between the city and Olympia
&amp; York started and failed several times over the decade.

   As the first mega-project approved since October's
earthquake, the development is seen as a great boost to San
Francisco's business fortunes and public image.
   Critical to resolving the impasse over the Yerba Buena
Gardens project were trade-offs that call for the
Toronto-based developer to fund up front about $110 million
in public improvements, including a huge park and esplanade,
within the redevelopment area. In exchange, the city has
granted Olympia &amp; York permission to build three high-rise
office buildings, comprising about 1.6 million square feet,
under a flexible schedule extending until the end of 1999.
   The approval comes at a time of flat demand in the city's
commerical office-space market, but "the key is the
flexibility the agreement gives us," said Albert Reichmann,
Olympia &amp; York's chairman, in an interview.
   Thus, while the market here "is not so strong that I would
start a speculative building now," Olympia &amp; York will have
ample time to find "a sizable tenant" to anchor the first of
its high-rises prior to beginning construction, Mr. Reichmann
said. The developer hopes to break ground on the first of
those buildings in 1993.
   The high-rise agreement is also important in that it
essentially grants Olympia &amp; York an exemption from a
recently adopted citizens initiative that put a cap of
400,000 square feet a year on new commercial projects.
   But Olympia &amp; York was forced to concede ground in other
areas. It essentially "decommercialized" two large blocks of
the development, abandoning plans for a privately operated
amusement park; it also greatly scaled down an original
proposal that would have allowed it to construct about
250,000 square feet of retail space in the project. Instead,
most of those areas will now be dedicated to "public places,"
including a children's park and museum, said Sandy Frucher,
an Olympia &amp; York executive vice president.
   Mr. Reichmann gave Mayor Art Agnos a check for $4.2
million, representing a "good faith payment" toward the $110
million total that will allow the city to begin planning and
building the the project's public amenities. The core of
those components, a 10-acre public park, will be built atop
the roof of an addition to the city's Moscone Civic Center.
That addition, currently under construction, is expected to
be completed next summer, allowing park construction to begin
then, city officials said.
   Olympia &amp; York is a closely held real estate development
concern; its other current projects include the
12-million-square-foot Canary Wharf office space complex in
London.
