   WASHINGTON -- A federal highway-safety agency reopened an
investigation into the alleged cracking of floors in
1979-1983 Mustangs and Capris after receiving dozens of
complaints, including one from a motorist whose car crashed
after he fell through the floorboards and lost control of the
vehicle.
   The low-level inquiry by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration was reopened this spring and covers 1.2
million Ford Motor Co. cars. The agency had closed a similar
investigation in April 1987 after concluding that "although
this problem is a significant driver irritant and expensive
to correct, the alleged floor pan cracking on the subject
vehicles doesn't appear to represent a safety hazard."

   At the time, no accidents or injuries had been reported as
a result of cracking pans, the steel plate that is under the
cars. But since the closing of the investigation, the Center
for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, has received 150
complaints, including reports of two serious accidents.
Earlier this year, it turned the complaints over to the
federal highway-safety agency, asking it to reopen its
investigation.
   Ford said it was "cooperating fully with {the agency} in
its investigation" but had no other comment on the action.
   One accident, according to the Center for Auto Safety,
involved a Los Angeles man who said he was seriously injured
in 1987 when he fell through the floor of his 1983 Mustang,
causing the vehicle to crash. In November 1987, the group
said, a 1980 Mustang split in half along a floor crack behind
the front seats after hitting a fence post.
   A spokesman for the highway-safety agency said it has
received a total of 554 complaints about the cars, including
170 since it closed its 1987 investigation. Most of the new
complaints were provided by the Center for Auto Safety.
   The consumer group has asked the agency to order a recall
of the vehicles before more drivers "slip through the
cracks." Government-ordered recalls are unusual; the federal
agency generally prefers to negotiate a voluntary recall by
the auto companies if needed. The new inquiry is a
preliminary evaluation, the lowest of the agency's three
levels of investigations.
