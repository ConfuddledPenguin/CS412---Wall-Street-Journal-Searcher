   IRVINE, Calif. -- National Education Corp. said the
liability insurer for its directors and officers agreed in
principle to pay about $5.5 million of a $11.9 million
settlement of several class-action lawsuits against the
company.
   The shareholder suits alleged that National Education made
misleading statements about its financial condition last
year. Federal court approval of the settlement is expected in
about 30 days, said a spokesman for the vocational training
concern.

   A private arbitrator also reached a decision concerning
severance payments and other benefits claimed by the
company's former chief executive officer, David Bright. The
arbitrator had ruled that the dismissal of Mr. Bright wasn't
"for cause" as defined by his contract.
   National Education didn't disclose terms of the decision.
The "net" effect of the insurance proceeds and the
arbitration settlement will be a "small positive
contribution" to results in the second quarter, the company
said. The spokesman declined to say whether the company would
report profit or loss in the period.
