   WASHINGTON -- Nelson Mandela's remarks about his affection
for Fidel Castro, which ruffled some feathers in Mr.
Mandela's recent trip to the U.S., arise from years of close
ties, including military assistance, between Cuba and the
African National Congress.
   Aides to the ANC leader gave details of the extensive but
little-known support Cuba has rendered to the anti-apartheid
struggle in South Africa. In interviews last week, the aides
also talked about the ANC's more limited relationship with
Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and with Yasser Arafat of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Mr. Mandela's positive comments about these three foreign
leaders were the only blemishes on his otherwise successful
eight-city tour of the U.S., which ended Saturday. He raised
a considerable amount in private donations for the ANC during
the visit. But some members of Congress said his favorable
comments about Mr. Castro, which upset anti-Castro Cubans,
about Mr. Arafat, which unsettled Jews, and about Mr.
Gadhafi, whose support of terrorism angers many Americans,
would make it more difficult to get the $50 million in U.S.
aid Mr. Mandela is seeking.
   Mr. Mandela explained publicly that the ANC forged ties
with Cuba in 1960, when, on a trip to the West, ANC leaders
received a promise of anti-apartheid aid from Cuba but no
such promise from the U.S. In the years that followed, Cuba's
support for the ANC was mostly educational, including medical
training. "The largest number of doctors we have was trained
in Cuba," said Thambo Mbeki, the ANC's director of
international relations.
   But after the 1976 uprising in Soweto, during which
students protesting the apartheid educational system were
shot down by South African government forces, Cuba began
military training for the ANC, said Patford Shuma, a member
of Mr. Mandela's U.S. traveling delegation.
   Mr. Castro indirectly assisted the ANC by providing troops
to help defend Angola from rebels backed by South Africa and
the U.S. After it won independence in 1975, Angola allowed
ANC training camps to operate there; continuing Cuban
military assistance helped protect the ANC camps in Angola
and facilitated ANC armed actions against South Africa, Mr.
Shuma said.
   "It was a very, very safe rear base for us," he added.
"The Cubans really helped us a lot."
   The ANC's ties with Mr. Arafat, brought to life in a
photograph of Mr. Mandela and Mr. Arafat embracing, have also
been controversial in the U.S. But unlike the ANC's ties to
Cuba, "the relationship with the PLO is purely political,"
said Thomas Nkobi, the ANC's treasurer-general. Because of
military links between South Africa and Israel, Mr. Nkobi
said, "We feel we are fighting a common enemy."
   An October 1989 study by the United Nations Center Against
Apartheid describes years of close military ties between
South Africa and Israel, including cooperation on the
development of a nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic
missile -- a modification of Israel's Jericho II. The report
asserts that Israel also has helped upgrade the Mirage III, a
South African fighter jet, and that it has provided refueling
aircraft that extended the range of South African spy planes
to Tanzania.
   The Israeli consul general in Chicago, Uri Bar-Ner, said
that Israel is now "in an accelerated pace of disengagement"
from military cooperation with South Africa. Israel's
collaboration was done "for survival, not for profit-making,"
he added. During his U.S. tour, Mr. Mandela placed the ANC
firmly behind Israel's right to exist, but in opposition to
its occupation of captured Arab territory.
   The ANC's relationship with Mr. Gadhafi, whom Mr. Mandela
called a "brother leader," is a new one. Indeed, Mr. Mandela
noted that Mr. Gadhafi until last February refused to let the
ANC open offices in Libya because of the involvement of South
African Jews in the anti-apartheid group. Before that, the
ANC had a distant relationship with Mr. Gadhafi, who
supported the Pan Africanist Congress, a liberation movement
that broke away from the ANC.
   In May, Mr. Mandela visited Libya and received $250,000 in
aid for the ANC from the Gadhafi government, Mr. Nkobi said.
