   MOSCOW -- Even in this age of glasnost, Mikhail Gorbachev
is keeping his cards close to his chest.
   The Soviet leader's lengthy speech, delivered to the
Communist Party Congress yesterday, was presented for
approval three days ago to the party's Central Committee, a
body still packed with conservatives. But instead of handing
over the whole speech, as is customary, he merely submitted
an outline.

   That evening Mr. Gorbachev telephoned Boris Yeltsin, a
reformist Central Committee member who was recently elected
president of the Russian Republic, to ask him what he
thought.
   "I can't comment because I have only seen the outline,"
Mr. Yeltsin told him. Mr. Gorbachev replied, "The full speech
will be much better than the outline," saying that he was
working through the weekend to complete the toughly worded
text.
   The incident, recounted by Mr. Yeltsin to fellow
delegates, may well be a foretaste of the party congress as a
whole. Barring major surprises, much of the action could take
place behind the scenes, with Mr. Gorbachev and other senior
officials manipulating the proceedings as best they can. Such
backroom intrigue characterized preparatory work for the
congress and is likely to continue, say senior officials
involved in the process.
   The reasons lie in the current precarious political
situation. Throughout his five years in office, Mr. Gorbachev
has shown himself to be a master tactician, seizing every
opportunity to outmaneuver potential opponents. But now more
than ever he has cause to tread carefully: A majority of
delegates at the congress, who must elect the party's top
officials -- including the leader -- are largely hostile to
Mr. Gorbachev's policies. But while they will probably air
their grievances, officials say they appear unlikely to mount
a concerted challenge to his leadership, fearing that it
could spell the end of the Communist Party's influence.
   As a result, the nuts-and-bolts details that are decided
at the congress will be crucial to determining whether
conservatives opposed to Mr. Gorbachev or moderates who
support him have come out on top. And both sides are bracing
for a battle over issues that may seem obscure to the
uninitiated.
   According to senior officials, the following points are
likely to serve as litmus tests for the direction of the
meeting:
                                                                                                       

   GENERAL SECRETARY VS. CHAIRMAN
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Gorbachev originally wanted to replace the current
leadership structure, which consists of a general secretary
and 11 Politburo members, with a bigger Presidium headed by a
chairman. Conservatives oppose the change, fearing it would
weaken the party's influence. Some radicals are also nervous
about the new structure because it would include a deputy
chairman and a first secretary in charge of the Central
Committee staff. If two conservatives are elected to these
posts, they could conspire against Mr. Gorbachev, they worry.
The Soviet leader himself told the Central Committee meeting
on Friday that the job of chairman "must not become an
honorary position," according to officials present.
                                                                                                       

   BIG VS. SMALL CENTRAL COMMITTEE
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Gorbachev initially proposed turning the party's
policy-making body into a small group of full-time officials.
The new Central Committee must be elected by the congress,
and radicals fear that mainly conservatives hostile to
perestroika will be selected. Mr. Gorbachev is now trying to
limit the damage by seeking approval to select 75 of the
members himself. That would swell the committee's size to
almost 370, an unwieldy organization that the Soviet leader
could manipulate.
                                                                                                       

   MEDVEDEV VS. RAZUMOVSKY
                                                                                                       

   The two men, both Central Committee secretaries, played
key roles in drafting the documents for the congress. Vadim
Medvedev, a centrist who is in charge of ideology, brought
several moderates onto his committee to write a draft
congress declaration. Georgy Razumovsky, in charge of party
cadres and more hard-line, drafted new party rules with a few
like-minded aides. Officials involved say there was almost no
coordination between the two, and their draft texts differ
sharply in tone and even content. The officials say they will
be watching to see how much either text is amended by the
congress, and whether Mr. Razumovsky will stand as a
candidate for one of the top offices.
                                                                                                       

   YAKOVLEV VS. POLOZKOV
                                                                                                       

   A last-minute meeting on Saturday decided to give the
floor to each Politburo member to report on his activities
since the previous congress in 1986. They will later face
re-election, and there are question marks over several
moderates in the leadership, notably Alexander Yakovlev, a
liberal who strongly opposes Russian nationalism, and Nikolai
Ryzhkov, the prime minister who is under fire from
conservatives for his economic reform plans. Mr. Yakovlev may
even give up without a struggle. In his report to delegates,
he hinted that this might be his last congress. He didn't
elaborate.
   By contrast, Ivan Polozkov, a conservative apparatchik who
was recently elected head of the newly formed Russian
(Republic) Communist Party, has strong backing from large
numbers of congress delegates. He isn't in the Politburo, but
is widely seen as a powerful candidate for top office.
   Mr. Gorbachev yesterday moved to deflect some of the
expected personal criticism of his colleagues and himself. He
persuaded the congress to make comments and ask questions of
Politburo members only once all the reports had been given,
rather than after each speaker.
   The first day's congress proceedings were dominated by Mr.
Gorbachev's report and speeches by several Politburo members.
But liberal delegates say there are already unmistakable
signs that conservatives have the upper hand. One sign came
in the morning, when an attempt by radicals to add Otto
Latsis, a reform-minded economist, to the meeting's editorial
commission was overwhelmingly defeated. Mr. Latsis is deputy
editor of the party's theoretical journal, Kommunist, and
last week announced that he and his colleagues would refuse
to join the new conservative-dominated Russian Communist
Party.
   A meeting of delegation heads on Saturday removed Mr.
Latsis's name from the list of commission members. According
to one official present, his inclusion sparked an angry
reaction. "He not only doesn't deserve to serve on the
commission, he shouldn't remain in the Communist Party,"
complained one irate speaker.
