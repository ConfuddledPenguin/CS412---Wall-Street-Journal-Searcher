   HUTCHINSON, Kan. -- Doskocil Cos., which in March filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code, said the federal bankruptcy court has
granted a six-month extension for the company to propose its
own reorganization plan.
   Doskocil and 18 of its subsidiaries, including Wilson
Foods Corp., now have until Jan. 11, 1991, to formulate a
plan and a March 12, 1991, deadline to solicit consents.
