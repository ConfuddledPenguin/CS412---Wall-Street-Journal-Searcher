   Enzon Inc. said that its product-license filing with the
Food and Drug Administration for a leukemia drug will be
delayed until it secures a long-term commitment from the
supplier of an enzyme critical to the drug's manufacture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers halted
trading in the pharmaceutical company's stock pending news.
The stock closed in national over-the-counter trading at
$9.75, off $1.125.

   Enzon, based in South Plainfield, N.J., has completed
preparation of its product-license application, but the "FDA
won't accept" the filing "without the long-term supply
commitment," a spokeswoman said. She added, "I can't give you
a time frame" for resolving the supply difficulty, "but we're
working very actively on it."
   The product-license application is for PEG L asparaginase,
a drug used to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia who are allergic to unmodified forms of the drug. In
March, Enzon received FDA clearance for Adagen (PEG ADA), a
treatment for a form of severe combined immunodeficiency
disease.
