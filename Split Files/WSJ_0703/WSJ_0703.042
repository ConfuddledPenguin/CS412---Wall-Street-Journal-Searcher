   WORLD BANK IN POLAND

   The World Bank opened an office in Warsaw -- its first
permanent office in Eastern Europe -- and gave Poland a $250
million loan for development of natural-gas resources and
energy conservation.
   World Bank Vice President Will Wapenhans lauded the
economic stabilization accomplished by Poland's
post-communist government but urged "even more rapid" steps
toward creating a market economy.
   The World Bank has loaned Poland a total of $781 million
for five projects since January. Officials say additional
loans amounting to about $2 billion are envisioned during the
next two fiscal years.
   The new loan, repayable over 17 years with a five-year
grace period, is to help wean Poland from its dependence on
coal as an energy source.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE EDICT
                                                                                                       

   The Singapore government ordered the dissolution of an
organization it said was a front to revive the banned
Unification Church. The Home Affairs Ministry said the Moral
Home Society, with about 200 members, was set up in 1986 to
obtain legal status for the church, whose followers are
widely known as "Moonies" after their South Korean leader,
Sun Myung Moon. Singapore banned the Unification Church in
1982, saying its "continued existence was prejudicial to
public welfare and good order."
                                                                                                       

   PORTUGAL CLAMPS DOWN
                                                                                                       

   The Bank of Portugal clamped down on foreign borrowing by
Portuguese companies by requiring that 40% of the value of
any capital raised abroad must be deposited in
non-interest-bearing accounts with the central bank. The
measure affects Portuguese companies' loans with foreign
banks and bond or stock issues offered on foreign capital
markets or bought by foreign investors. "Foreign capital
inflows over the last months have registered a marked
increase, bloating domestic liquidity and creating
difficulties for economic policy," a government statement
said.
                                                                                                       

   THE JAPANESE AND TECHNOLOGY
                                                                                                       

   Three out of four Japanese adults think technology
improves their lives, but more than half worry it could cost
them their jobs, according to a poll released by the prime
minister's office. In a nationwide poll of 3,000 Japanese
over the age of 18, 76% said technology improved their
standard of living. But 55.5% said they feared their jobs
could be performed by robots, computers and other automation
techniques. Of those surveyed, 32.1% believed technology
would never make their jobs redundant.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIETS' DWINDLING OIL OUTPUT
                                                                                                       

   Soviet oil production has entered a long-term downward
trend, a phenomenon that might trigger a world-wide spiral in
oil prices, a private research institute in Japan reportedly
said. According to a Japanese news agency, the Institute of
Energy Economics reported that oil output by the Soviet Union
dropped by 300,000 barrels per day in 1989 and has been
plunging by 500,000 barrels per day this year. The exhaustion
of large oil fields, surging costs of exploration, and
reduced investment in the energy sector are said to be
factors behind the diminishing output.
                                                                                                       

   WHALING BAN UNDER REVIEW
                                                                                                       

   Norway and Iceland, eager to lift a ban on whaling, said
there are enough whales in the world's oceans to resume some
commercial hunting. "There are no reasons to wait," Iceland's
Minister of Fisheries Halldor Asgrimsson told a conference in
the Netherlands of the 36-nation International Whaling
Commission. Conservationists say the move is the biggest
threat to whale populations since a global ban on commercial
whaling took effect in 1986.
                                                                                                       

   LOAN FOR AIR CHINA
                                                                                                       

   Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp. will offer a loan of $126
million to Air China, a Japanese news agency reported.
   The Japanese bank also reportedly revealed it has obtained
consent from the Finance Ministry and has already put a part
of the loan into action. This would be the first move by a
Japanese bank to resume giving new loans to China since a
suspension of credit to the country following the military
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last year.
   Air China will use part of the loan from Mitsubishi Trust
to buy new aircraft, according to the agency report.
   In another report, the agency said the head of the
Export-Import Bank of Japan hinted at the possibility of
resuming the bank's financial support for trade with China
even under Japan's current economic sanctions against China.
"The bank is willing to reopen financial support for Japanese
exporters who do business with China on a case-by-case
basis," the bank's president, Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, was quoted
as saying.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Airlines canceled dozens of flights in and out of Paris as
air-traffic controllers prepared for a three-day strike set
to begin today at France's largest flight-control center. . .
. India's former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi ordered his
party's youth wing to physically stop Amnesty International
officials from entering India to investigate alleged
human-rights abuses. Last week, the government lifted a
six-month-old ban on the London-based human-rights
organization's entry to India.
