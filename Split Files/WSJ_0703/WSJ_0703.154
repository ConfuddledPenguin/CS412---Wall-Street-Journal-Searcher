   Great American Bank, attempting to combat its problems by
any means possible, said it converted from a state chartered
bank into a federal savings bank. The new name is Great
American Bank, a Federal Savings Bank.
   Like many thrifts, San Diego-based Great American has been
hurt by real estate losses, especially in Arizona. The
conversion to a federal savings bank won't alter its
operations, but it will eliminate state regulatory
assessments that total about $500,000. Great American, the
nation's seventh-largest thrift with about $15.4 billion of
assets, would welcome any help: Federal regulators have given
it until the end of the year to come up with $350 million or
face conservatorship.

   On Friday, the thrift announced that its board of trustees
named Robert Kemper, 61 years old, to serve as its new
chairman, chief executive officer and president. Mr. Kemper
was scheduled to take over for retired chief executive Gordon
Luce and former president Paul Lindland yesterday. The move
was seen by industry analysts as a reflection of continuing
regulatory pressure on Great American.
