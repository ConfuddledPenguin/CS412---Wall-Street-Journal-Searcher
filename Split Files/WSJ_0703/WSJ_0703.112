   King World Productions Inc., New York, said fiscal
third-quarter net income climbed 23%, as it continued to take
in higher license fees from three television shows it
distributes -- "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "Wheel of Fortune"
and "Jeopardy]"
   King World also said it benefited from its TV news show
"Inside Edition," which it produces and distributes.

   For the period ended May 31, net rose to $14.2 million, or
54 cents a share, from $11.6 million, or 46 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue grew 12% to $81.2 million from $72.4
million. The latest results reflect a charge of six cents a
share for amortization and depreciation from the December
1988 acquisition of WIVB-TV of Buffalo, N.Y.
   The company recently announced a 3-for-2 stock split,
payable July 23 to stock of record July 9. The per-share net
King reported doesn't reflect that split.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
King World shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $37.125.
