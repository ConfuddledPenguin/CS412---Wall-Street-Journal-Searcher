   San Francisco -- Tourist guides to Bayreuth are full of
advice on what pilgrims should do on the days off between
performances of Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelung." You can
potter through quaint shops, go for hikes in the hills, make
excursions to nearby castles and spas. Last month, the San
Francisco Bay area solved its own version of that problem by
offering two music festivals simultaneously: the first of
four cycles of Wagner's "Ring" west of the bay (with mixed
results); and the inaugural, totally successful, Berkeley
Festival of early music to the east. A diligent, omnivorous
music lover could counter the aftereffects of a surfeit of
romantic chromaticism, day by day, with the lovely plinking
of harpsichords, the simple harmonies of a Renaissance
consort.
   The 1990 San Francisco Opera "Ring" was a revival of one
first staged in its entirety here in 1985. The director and
designer (Nikolaus Lehnhoff and John Conklin, working
originally with conductor Edo de Waart) were under orders to
come up with something beautiful, naturalistic, and
unencumbered by the kind of heavy ideological "concepts" that
had dominated European productions of the '70s and '80s. We
did (for $4 million-plus) get a "Ring" that was stunning to
look at; but also one that was vastly more interesting than
the Met's no less costly version of 1989, just seen on PBS by
several million U.S. television viewers.

   Unfortunately, Mr. Lehnhoff and the new San Francisco
general director, Lotfi Mansouri, had what are politely
called "artistic differences." Mr. Lehnhoff refused to return
to see the 1990 version through. With his monumental
undertaking left in the hands of two relatively inexperienced
young directors, the production as a whole -- despite some
moments of brilliance -- seemed a paled replica of its flawed
but dazzling original.
   The big difference between San Francisco's "Ring" and the
Met's is that in the former a great many of Wagner's scene
and stage directions are ignored (as they have been at
Bayreuth since 1951), in favor of a mixture of
characterizations, actions and locales designed to stimulate
reflection on both Wagner's time and our own. The gods (and,
later, the Gibichungs) dwell not on craggy mountaintops but
in gilded pavilions, and wear costumes (half Roman, half
modern) meant to communicate more about their essence and
their values than did the helmets and breastplates of old --
though we have those also. Loge, in 1985 the family attorney,
wore a natty 19th-century cutaway suit. As he dismissed the
gods at the end of "Das Rheingold," he settled back into
Wotan's throne to read his Wall Street Journal. (This year,
for some reason, he was the family poet; he wore a Byronic
collar and read a slim volume of verse.)
   Edo de Waart may not be one of the world's great Wagnerian
conductors, but his absence this round also was felt. In his
place, the four 1990 cycles were split between two relative
newcomers, Peter Schneider from Mannheim (who has conducted
the "Ring" at Bayreuth), and British-born Donald Runnicles of
Hanover (who had never done it before). On the evidence of
the first cycle, Mr. Schneider can achieve genuine
magnificence with the score, when all is going well -- e.g.,
through most of "Die Walkure" and "Siegfried." But almost all
of "Das Rheingold" -- crucial orchestral interludes, "love"
music generally and the spectacular finale -- fell below
international-standard Wagner.
   What of the singers? Helmut Pampuch's Mime and Helga
Dernesch's Fricka may have lost some fire and shine in five
years. But both still are masterly dramatic and musical
performers, and compelling to watch. James Morris played two
of the three Wotans in 1985; this year (as at New York) he
sang them all. Although his acting is of the minimalist
school, there probably is not a better Wotan singing today.
There was a weak new Loge (Jacque Trussel) and a fabulous new
Alberich (Tom Fox); Birgitta Svenden, a new Erda we share
with the Met, sang a moving mezzo Earth Mother, weary of the
Earth. The Valkyries were loud and clear, if not always a
pleasure to look at or listen to, especially when amplified.
The Rhinemaidens, in maidenly shifts, sang awkwardly in Opera
I, beautifully in Opera IV.
   Rebecca Blankenship was vocally out of her league as
Sieglinde; Gary Lakes, as her brother and lover (also at the
Met, and on TV), will erase no one's memories of Peter
Hofmann, who at least looked heroic. But Mr. Lakes sang with
ringing, Italianate power.
   Gwyneth Jones, the first of San Francisco's three
Brunnhildes, was the rock on which this fitfully impressive
"Ring" rose and fell, through all three operas in which she
appeared. At her finest moments, all in "Die Walkure," she
soared splendid, strong and free, and reminded one of what
Wagner at his best is all about. In her love scenes with her
nephew Siegfried (William Johns), her great instrument too
often went out of control.
   These two aspects of her role were strangely reconciled in
"Gotterdammerung," in which Brunnhilde turns from
ex-Valkyrie-become-human-lover to hysterical woman scorned.
Here Dame Gwyneth's jagged, fortissimo leaps and sometimes
wild sounds suited the haggard, Straussian madwoman
Brunnhilde has become.
   Such frenzy, like last fall's earthquake, hardly touched
Berkeley, where, trying to play an instant game of
catch-up-and-overtake with the nine-year-old Boston Early
Music Festival, the University of California staged a
parallel event during the San Francisco "Ring." This kept
music critics and fans locked in traffic jams on the rebuilt
Bay Bridge.
   The first Berkeley Festival imitated its biennial Eastern
model in many ways (the idea is to alternate them year by
year in the future), while nearly doubling the number of
concerts. There were 24 here, as against 15 at Boston,
involving 13 different groups and three soloists, plus three
master classes and five symposia, all depending as much on
local talent as on imported names.
   The festival was contrived to provide a setting for one of
Berkeley Prof. Alan Curtis's celebrated early-opera
productions, which Europe sees far more of than we do. His
choice was Nicolo Jommelli's "La Schiava Liberata" of 1768, a
work not wholly unlike Mozart's "Die Entfuhrung aus dem
Serail" of 1782. The ingenious sets, designed for Mr.
Curtis's first revival of the opera at Amsterdam in 1982,
already have been used at Monte Carlo.
   This was a wholly professional effort, including singers
such as countertenor Jeffrey Gall (the casting, in fact,
could hardly have been better). It was stage-directed with
panache and costumed and lighted in glory. Mr. Jommelli is of
course no Mozart: "La Schiava Liberata" proved to be jumbled
but jolly, musically engaging and ingenious, and worth seeing
perhaps once in a lifetime.
   In addition to his imported soloists, director and sets
from Europe, Mr. Curtis made use of Nicholas McGegan's
impeccable San Francisco-based Philharmonia Baroque
Orchestra. It also offered two performances of Handel's
second oratorio, "La Resurrezione" (written in 1708, when the
composer was 23), a felicitous, transparent, predictable and
poignant work. Philip Brett, also of the Berkeley faculty,
conducted both Monteverdi's Mass and his "Vespers of the
Blessed Virgin" (1610) -- but that was my day for "Siegfried"
'cross the bay. Thomas Binkley, from the University of
Indiana, concocted an exuberant, high-spirited, trilingual
entertainment (involving 42 onstage performers) out of
various chunks of the original -- i.e., not Carl Orff's --
"Carmina Burana" manuscript, which was designed to transport
us to some kind of 13th-century
folk-outing-cumreligious-revival.
   Wrung out by the "Ring," I settled for the Jomelli opera
and six other good performances, a lively debate on the Early
Music Debate (or, Who Gives a Damn About Authenticity
Anymore?), and a wonderful exhibition in the Student Union
ballroom, where I pretended to be interested in buying
imitation-old harpsichords, sycamore dulcians, faggots and
curtals, and an authentic-old 1759 Stainer violin. I ended up
with an armload of Wagner/Earrly Music T-shirts, bargain CDs
and some unanswered questions about how music ever made it
from plainchant to Wagner.
