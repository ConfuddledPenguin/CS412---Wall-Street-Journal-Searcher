   To many of the folks who deal with it, the Resolution
Trust Corp. has been a giant bureaucratic slug, completing
its assigned task at an agonizingly slow pace.
   Douglas Slain wouldn't want it any other way.

   Mr. Slain is the executive director of the six-month-old
RTC Contractors Association, a for-profit group whose aim is
to feed information -- for a healthy $580 a year -- to the
lawyers and accountants who will be working for the RTC, a
federal agency created by Congress last August to mop up the
savings-and-loan mess.
   Mr. Slain is also the publisher of the monthly Bank/Thrift
Litigation Reporter, available for $487 a year; the monthly
RTC/FDIC Litigators' Work Product Portfolio, a steal for $45
a month; and the freshly begun Bank/Thrift Expert Witness
Database, updated weekly for just $75 a quarter. Plans are
already under way for the RTC Contractors First Annual
Conference next Jan. 24.
   Mr. Slain is counting on the RTC to keep to a snail-like
pace in managing and selling busted thrifts and the real
estate they financed. The longer the agency takes, the more
he makes. "I've spent a lot of money trying to glom onto
every aspect of this so I can have a lot of products to talk
about," he says.
   Mr. Slain isn't the only entrepreneur trying to glom onto
the growing RTC information industry. The massive
thrift-reform legislation has spawned a host of conferences,
newsletters and how-to guides. "I've got a stack on my desk
maybe a foot high of just RTC stuff," says Walter Blake, a
Dallas-based executive with the National Association of
Industrial and Office Parks.
   Not every potential customer is enthusiastic. "I was
outraged when I got a pamphlet from some company asking $500
for a book," says Deborah Wilson, a Dallas attorney. "It was
probably the same information you can get from the RTC. The
kicker is that they'll sell you supplements." But Ms. Wilson
herself is also benefiting from the creation of the RTC:
She's an adviser to people seeking contracts from the agency.
   Despite the criticism, publishers uniformly say
subscriptions are meeting or exceeding expectations.
Resolution Trust Reporter, a biweekly newsletter offered by
the publishers of National Mortgage News (formerly National
Thrift News), goes to almost 1,000 subscribers who ponied up
$398 a year each, according to consulting editor Stan
Strachan. Publishers of two weekly newsletters, RTC Watch
($550 a year from the American Banker group) and Bank/Thrift
Litigation and Enforcement News ($407 a year from Atlantic
Information Services Inc.), declined to disclose the number
of subscribers.
   Newsletters aren't the only product of the RTC publishing
boom. After a four-month marketing effort, Thompson
Publishing Group of Washington, D.C., went to press earlier
this month with the loose-leaf Guide to Contracting with the
RTC ($398 a year, including monthly news bulletins), adding
the title to its library of offerings, which include the Fair
Labor Standards Handbook and the Underground Storage Tank
Guide.
   For people interested in more than just reading about the
RTC, there is the conference circuit. Mr. Blake combed
through his foot-tall stack of RTC materials and came up with
22 conferences or seminars on the RTC that were held during
the past eight months. Among the sponsors: the American
Bankers Association, the Practising Law Institute, the
Institute for International Research and the fledgling Thrift
Bailout Minority Contractors Association.
   But the RTC conference sponsors, who did a land-office
business in the first few months of the agency's existence,
have since watched attendees flock instead to the seminars of
a formidable competitor: the RTC itself.
   The agency's 10-city road show, launched in mid-April, has
attracted more than 5,000 people so far, including about 700
who turned out for the eighth seminar, held two weeks ago in
Washington. Attendees get the basics -- how to contract with
the agency, how to buy a thrift -- directly from RTC
personnel.
   "We felt that rather than trying to convince others that
they should tailor their programs to {provide} important core
information, it would be more efficient to put on our own
seminars," says Steve Katsanos, a spokesman for the RTC in
Washington.
   And for beleaguered RTC watchers, it's a lot cheaper. The
RTC is charging $220 a person for its one-day seminars. By
contrast, Dorset Group Inc., publisher of National Mortgage
News and the Resolution Trust Reporter, was asking $595 a
head for its early May conferences on the RTC and Real
Estate. As proof that the free market works, Dorset canceled
the meetings when the RTC announced its less costly series.
Mr. Katsanos says the RTC prices its seminars to cover
expenses, not to make a profit. "They're paying for
themselves," he says.
   By running its own show and driving off some of the
competition, the RTC has also helped relieve some of the
strain on its employees, who have been in high demand as
speakers since last August. Carmen Sullivan, the southwest
regional RTC director, says she used to make three
appearances a week. Now, with the RTC dominating the
conference market, that has declined to one a week.
   Of course, there is also considerable demand for RTC
discussions at almost any gathering of lawyers or real estate
specialists, among others. Ms. Sullivan notes that she has
spoken to groups of senior citizens, appraisers, real estate
agents, home builders, even a group of professionals
concerned with right-of-way issues. Yesterday, she addressed
the Association of Women Entrepreneurs of Dallas Inc.
   "It's absolutely un-chic to have a seminar without
discussing the RTC," says Deborah Kops, head of the real
estate advisory group in the Dallas office of Arthur Andersen
&amp; Co.
   But some would-be contractors are beginning to show signs
of over-education. Robert Grunnah of Grunnah/Cole Real
Property Co. in Dallas says representatives of his firm
attended three or four conferences before determining they
weren't worth the price of admission. "Nobody's come up with
the magic recipe for doing business with the RTC," he says.
   Many of the speakers, Mr. Grunnah says, offer "viewpoints"
and no facts about the RTC's agenda. The facts that are
discussed, he maintains, can be had with a phone call or two
to the RTC itself. "There are much better areas for companies
like us to put their money in than going to conventions or
seminars," he says.
   Mr. Grunnah is investing the money previously spent on
conferences on an in-house coordinator who keeps track of new
developments at the RTC. The coordinator, he says, "is as
current or more current than the seminars."
   Mr. Grunnah can take heart. Soon, he will have the
opportunity to save even more money by eliminating the job of
RTC coordinator and subscribing instead to the newest product
from the ambitious Mr. Slain of the RTC Contractors
Association.
   Noting the 30 to 35 RTC conferences scheduled for this
year, Mr. Slain plans to dispatch reporters to a dozen or so.
And come July 15, you, too, can subscribe to Bank/Thrift
Seminars Digest, described by Mr. Slain as a "quarterly
summary of the proceedings and handouts at all significant
seminars and conferences."
