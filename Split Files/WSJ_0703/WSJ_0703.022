   Philadelphia's financial plight worsened as Moody's
Investors Service Inc. reduced the city's bond rating to
speculative grade, putting the bonds out of reach for many
potential investors.
   Moody's, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., reduced its
rating on Philadelphia's $1.35 billion in general obligation
bonds to Ba from Baa, one notch below investment grade. It's
the lowest of any major city in the nation. Two weeks ago,
McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. unit dropped its
rating on Philadelphia bonds to triple-B-minus from
triple-B-plus.

   The rating will "exclude a substantial number of potential
buyers," including most trust departments and most municipal
bond funds, except high-risk, high-yield "junk" bond funds,
said S. E. Canaday, vice president and market strategist at
John Nuveen &amp; Co., a Chicago-based municipal securities firm.
   Moody's noted that Philadelphia's proposed $2.2 billion
budget for fiscal 1991, which began July 1, makes no
provisions for funding $32.4 million in services for children
and youths, which is a mandated expense, as well as possible
increased personnel costs which may result from labor
contracts with city unions that are currently in arbitration.
   The Philadelphia City Council did approve a 0.5% local
sales tax to fund the city's $45 million subsidy of its
regional bus and train transit system. However, the city
needs the state Legislature's approval before it can collect
the new tax. The Legislature isn't expected to take action on
this tax plan until after the gubernatorial elections in
November.
   Moody's said that, in a worst-case scenario, the city's
1991 fiscal deficit could grow to between $80 million and
$160 million before its fiscal year ends next June.
Philadelphia has run budget deficits in the past three years,
ending fiscal 1990 with a shortfall of about $60 million.
   When Moody's reviewed the city's finances last year,
analysts were encouraged by the adoption by Mayor Wilson B.
Goode's administration of a five-year plan designed to
improve the city's constrained financial position, said
Jeffrey Rizzo, a managing director of Moody's. He noted that
the city has made some progress in controlling some expenses,
but there's much uncertainty about whether the city can
develop recurring funding sources and enhance its revenue
base.
   "{A rating of} Ba is a real slap in the face. It's a major
hurdle for any issuer to overcome," said Mr. Canaday, noting
that the lower bond rating also means Philadelphia will have
to pay higher interest rates when it raises money in the
capital markets. With the lower rating, he estimated,
Philadelphia could pay some extra 50 to 100 basis points over
current rates when it borrows in the future.
   City officials said Philadelphia has no immediate plans
for selling general-obligation bonds. But it will be
arranging a temporary cash-flow borrowing for about $270
million to $290 million, which it must pay off in the current
fiscal year.
   Mayor Goode said he was disappointed by Moody's action.
But he noted that Fitch's Investors Service maintained its
triple-B rating on the city's bonds.
   Benjamin Blakney, Philadelphia's treasurer, believes the
city "has a window of opportunity" between now and year end
where it can get its financial house in order, especially if
it persuades the state to take its fair share of the children
and youth expenses as well as persuade the state Legislature
to approve the local sales tax to help fund the transit
system.
