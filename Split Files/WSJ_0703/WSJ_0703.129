   AUSTIN, Texas -- HealthVest, an ailing real estate
investment trust, said it agreed to transfer the operating
lease on Eastwood Medical Center to Regent Health Group Inc.,
a closely held hospital-management company.
   The Eastwood facility, a 243-bed hospital in Memphis,
Tenn., will continue to be operated by Healthcare
International Inc. until the new lease is signed. Signing,
said HealthVest officials, is contingent on successful
formation of a physician limited partnership and is expected
by Aug. 31.

   HealthVest had a net loss of $116.8 million, or $10.57 a
share, for 1989, much of it the result of troubles at
Healthcare International, which leases many of its
properties. The two companies have had a standstill agreement
for several months and have extended it to Oct. 15, 1990,
according to HealthVest officials. Terms of the extension
call for payments of $2.4 million a month by Healthcare plus
net cash proceeds from its hospital in Tustin, Calif.
   HealthVest also has a standstill agreement with its
lenders that is to remain in effect until Dec. 14 while it
tries to restructure about $252 million in debt.
