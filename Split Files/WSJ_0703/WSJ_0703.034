   WASHINGTON -- The nation's beleaguered manufacturing
sector showed more signs of emerging from its long slump,
according to a closely watched report by the National
Association of Purchasing Management.
   An index compiled by the group, based on orders,
production, employment and other indicators of manufacturing
health, rose to 51.1% in June from 50.7% in May. That marks
the third consecutive month the index has registered above
50%, and the association says any reading above 50% means the
manufacturing economy is "generally expanding." From May 1989
through March 1990 every monthly reading was below that
threshold.

   The index is based on a survey of purchasing executives in
about 300 companies across the country, but economists and
the financial markets pay considerable attention to it
because it is often the first published report of economic
activity for any month.
   After seeing the index yesterday, Norman Robertson, chief
economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said, "I think all
the evidence would now point to a slow, sluggish rate of
improvement in the manufacturing sector."
   Manufacturers, particularly makers of cars and other
big-ticket items, have been among the hardest hit by the
Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation by holding
interest rates high. But though recent economic indicators --
including durable-goods orders and the government's index of
leading indicators -- have suggested manufacturing may be
picking up strength, other sectors of the economy still seem
to be flailing.
   The Commerce Department reported yesterday that
construction spending slipped 0.4% in May, its second drop in
a row.
   The decline, which lowered the annual rate of construction
spending to $445.6 billion, followed a 2.2% decline in April.
In its initial report last month the department estimated the
April decrease at 0.7%.
   High mortgage rates and a growing caution among banks
about making real estate loans have battered the construction
industry in recent months. Commerce Department reports showed
that spending on both residential and business construction
fell in April and May.
   While a credit squeeze has crimped the real estate market,
the purchasing managers association said it found scant
evidence that tight credit conditions are spreading to other
parts of the economy. Of the companies seeking loans in the
past two months, "only a few experienced any tightened
lending restrictions or felt the need to issue commercial
paper as a substitute," the report said. However, a number of
the companies noticed that many of their smaller suppliers
and customers were having some trouble getting additional
credit.
   The numbers in both reports were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
