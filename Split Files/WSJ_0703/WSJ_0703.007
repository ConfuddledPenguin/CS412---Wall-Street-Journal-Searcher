   In a bid to increase its share of the U.S. jewelry market,
Ratners Group PLC, based in London, offered to acquire Kay
Jewelers Inc. in a stock swap. But the deal may be held up by
holders of Kay's junk bonds.
   Ratners offered shareholders of the Alexandria, Va.,
jewelry chain one share of new convertible preferred stock
for each of Kay's 12.4 million outstanding shares. Ratners
said the new preferred would pay an annual dividend of $1.06
a share and could be converted into three common shares for
about 326 pence, or $5.70, a common share. Ratners valued the
offer at $17 a share, or $210.8 million, although analysts
pegged it at $15 to $16 a share.

   Ratners also said it intends to pay about $210 million to
assume all of Kay's outstanding debt.
   Kay said the board unanimously approved Ratners's offer.
In late trading on London's stock exchange yesterday,
Ratners's shares were at 264 pence, down 11 pence. Kay shares
soared $3.375 yesterday to $14.25 in heavy New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   Ratners said the acquisition is contingent on Ratners's
purchase of a majority of both of Kay's junk bond issues,
which have a total face value of $150 million. Ratners said
it will launch a tender offer for the bonds at 75% of face
value. As of March 23, Kay also had about $80 million in
outstanding bank debt.
   Several bondholders and bond analysts said Ratners's offer
was unfair to the bondholders, who have legally first claim
on Kay's assets. "The shareholders seem to have gotten a
pretty good deal vis-a-vis the bondholders," said Robert M.
Winer, an analyst with Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co. in Washington,
D.C. "The bondholders should be paid in full before the
shareholders get anything." About 53% of Kay's stock is owned
by management and employees.
   "It's not an attractive price," added Randy Hale, senior
portfolio manager of Cincinnati Financial Corp., which holds
about $1.5 million in Kay bonds. "We'll be inclined to hold,"
he said.
   In particular, holders of Kay's $100 million of 12 7/8
senior subordinated notes have little apparent incentive to
accept Ratners's 75% bid. Under the loan covenant, those
bondholders can force any buyer of Kay to redeem the bonds at
full face value.
   Some analysts said that bondholders can afford to wait for
a better deal, now that Kay has secured a $80 million
revolving credit line approved last week. "Kay is in no
immediate danger," says Frederick H. Taylor, a high-yield
bond analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "It has sufficient
operating income to meet the debt repayment schedule."
   "I would not recommend a tender" based on what Ratner has
said so far, Mr. Winer said. Indeed, traders said that there
was little trading in Kay's bonds yesterday, with potential
buyers offering 75, or about $750 for every $1,000 in face
value, and sellers asking about 90. On Friday, both issues
were trading at about 60.
   "Ratners wants to buy Kay, and Kay apparently wants to be
purchased," said Deborah Peterson, an analyst with IDS
Financial Services Inc., which holds enough bonds to "make a
difference." Ms. Peterson added: "They have to deal with us,
and we haven't heard from them yet."
   Ratners officials could not be reached for comment. Kay's
general counsel, John Kosik, said he was not aware of
discontent among bondholders.
   To help finance the Kay acquisition, Ratners said it
intends to raise about #129 million from the proceeds of a
rights offering of about 60.7 million shares of common stock
at 220 pence per unit.
   Ratners said the acquisition, which will increase the
number of its U.S. stores to 967 from about 473, fits its
plan to expand its share of the highly fragmented U.S.
jewelry market to 10%. With the Kay acquisition, Ratners
would control about 5.7% of the market.
