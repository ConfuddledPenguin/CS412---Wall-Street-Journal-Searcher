   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- N.V. Philips plans to
eliminate 10,000 jobs and expects a loss of about two billion
guilders ($1.07 billion) for 1990, its new chairman said.
   But Jan Timmer, in his first day as chief of the Dutch
electronics giant, told a shareholders meeting that Philips
wouldn't give up on its troubled computer and semiconductor
operations.

   Reacting to the news, Philips shares sank 87.5 cents to
close at $16.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, after falling over 7% on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange. Analysts argued that the job cuts -- about 3.5% of
the work force -- were too small, warned of lower dividends
and fretted about a slump in earnings from Philips's lighting
division. Philips is also the parent of North American
Philips Corp., based in New York City, which makes electronic
products under the Magnavox brand.
   Mr. Timmer, a 38-year veteran of Philips who most recently
headed the consumer electronics division, acknowledged that
the company faces a struggle to regain its credibility. "We
have to prove that we are as good as we think we are," he
said at the shareholders meeting. The meeting was called to
ratify his appointment to succeed Cornelis van der Klugt, who
was forced to resign in May after his forecast that Philips
would show higher profit this year proved wildly optimistic.
   Mr. Timmer, 57 years old, provided few details about his
restructuring plans, saying they were still being formulated,
and declined to comment on how dividends would be affected.
   He said the job cuts would be primarily in Europe.
Philips's total world-wide work force of 290,000 already has
shrunk by nearly 90,000 over the past 10 years as the company
has lurched through a series of restructuring programs.
   While the personnel cuts were greater than expected,
analysts were unimpressed, saying the company probably could
eliminate 10,000 jobs through attrition alone. Arjen Los of
County NatWest Securities in London estimated that Philips
would need to shed 40,000 to 50,000 people to attain
efficiency comparable with its strongest rivals. At UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, another London brokerage firm, Dorian Foyil
said: "It's a huge bureaucracy. You could get rid of 10,000
people in management alone and just make a dent."
   Philips said it would make a provision of 2.7 billion
guilders in this year's second half to cover the costs of
severance payments, write-downs in asset values and other
restructuring expenses. Had restructuring costs been at the
"normal" level, Philips said, the profit forecast for 1990
would be 400 million guilders, down from 1.37 billion
guilders in 1989. Sales for 1990 are expected to total 56
billion guilders, down from 57.22 billion guilders.
   For this year's first five months, Philips said operating
profit fell 13% from a year earlier to 774 million guilders,
but profit grew 16% to 326 million, reflecting gains on asset
sales and other exceptional items. In a major surprise,
Philips also said profit from its lighting division, long the
company's cash cow, slumped 23% in the latest five months.
   In the computer division, Mr. Timmer promised to curtail
development and manufacturing and to stress assembly of
computer systems using standardized products made by others.
He said Philips would focus on its strengths, such as
providing computer systems to banks and producing optical
imaging and storage products. He also pledged to trim the
company's direct-sales staff and rely more on computer
dealers.
   Philips has been ambushed by rapid shifts in the market to
systems based on personal computers instead of minicomputers,
to standardized systems from proprietary technology and to
dealership sales from direct selling, Mr. Timmer said.
   Philips's professional products and systems division --
which includes computers as well as several healthier product
ranges, such as medical electronics, telecommunications and
accoustical equipment -- showed an operating loss of 124
million guilders in the first five months on sales of 4.74
billion guilders.
   Mr. Timmer acknowledged that Philips is stuck with
unsalable inventories of outdated computer equipment and said
the company would try to put its own house in order before
deciding whether to form an alliance in the industry.
   The components division -- which includes integrated
circuits, color television tubes and other electronic parts
-- produced an operating loss of 42 million guilders in the
first five months. Because of the deteriorating results, Mr.
Timmer said, Philips will provide less "support" to
loss-making integrated circuits and focus its efforts on
fewer ranges of chips.
   Philips's U.S. semiconductor unit, Signetics Corp., based
in Sunnyvale, Calif., is on track with its plans to return to
profitability under new management, Mr. Timmer said. He said
the latest restructuring plans would have little effect on
Signetics.
   Philips's lighting division, the world's biggest producer
of lamps, showed operating profit of 267 million guilders in
the five months, down from 346 million guilders a year
earlier.
   Philips did have good news in its biggest division,
consumer electronics, where operating profit in the five
months shot up 85% to 645 million guilders from 349 million
guilders.
   Though shareholders applauded Mr. Timmer's speech
vigorously, many scathingly criticized the company's
management during a question session afterward.
   For instance, several shareholders expressed incredulity
over assertions by Wisse Dekker, the head of Philips's
supervisory board, that the company's financial reporting
system is working well. Only three months ago, the company's
former chairman, Mr. van der Klugt, predicted higher profit
for 1990 and failed to signal the plunge in first-quarter
results.
   Mr. Dekker insisted that Philips couldn't discuss the
reasons for that faulty forecast because of pending
litigation in the U.S., where Philips shareholders have filed
a suit accusing the company of having misled investors about
its prospects.

 3 -- June 14: Philips says second-quarter profits will be
lower than in 1989 and that full-year profits will be very
low.
