   Three rocket engine makers said they are exploring the
possibility of forming a team to develop a propulsion system
for a new family of launch vehicles designed to lift heavy
payloads into space at a fraction of the current cost.
   Rockwell International Corp.'s Rocketdyne division, the
Pratt &amp; Whitney division of United Technologies Corp., and
Aerojet, GenCorp's aerospace segment, said the team approach
was requested by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the government agency overseeing the engine
development program.

   Rocketdyne's project marketing manager, David Wright, said
that the team might become effective as early as Oct. 1 if an
agreement can be reached on melding the companies' nine
existing contracts for the project's initial phase. The next
two phases, which he valued at $600 million to $700 million
over five to six years, would begin in October 1991.
   The companies said they will design an engine using liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants with a 580,000-pound
thrust level. The new engine would be the first significant
advance in rocket engine technology since the early 1970s, a
Rocketdyne spokeswoman said.
