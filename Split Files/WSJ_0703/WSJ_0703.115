   Campbell Soup Co., Camden, N.J., said it sold its Juice
Bowl Products Inc. subsidiary to ABA Holding Inc. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Campbell, which is trying to sell several businesses to
boost profit, disclosed in January that it had put Juice Bowl
on the auction block. The company said the unit, which had
sales in fiscal 1989 of about $60 million, no longer fits
with plans to focus on Campbell's two main beverages, tomato
and V8 juices.

   The sale involves a plant in Lakeland, Fla., which employs
220 people. Campbell said ABA Holding will retain the work
force, the plant and the Juice Bowl name.
   ABA Holding, based in Cranbury, N.J., is the parent of a
Belgium fruit juice company, Looza N.V.
