   I was amused to see your June 18 editorial "The Flag and
the Community" glorifying the repression of free speech in
this country directly above another denouncing a similar
movement in Romania. I'm not so amused by the idea that you
and Ion Illiescu seem to agree on so many issues.
   You blame the media for the hype surrounding the
flag-burning amendment, 2 Live Crew's outlawed album and many
controversial art exhibits. Mr. Illiescu blames the media for
the anti-government uprisings in his country. It's not the
repressive governmental policies that matter to you, it's the
fact that the media is letting the people know what's
happening. It's funny what a stir the truth can cause.

   You write that a community has rights superior to an
individual's. It can force individuals to have clean
thoughts, provide them with sanitized artwork, and make them
respect the community's symbol of liberty. Mr. Illiescu has
shown us that a truncheon is a very effective tool for a
community trying to teach its members which opinions are
acceptable.
   We need judgment, you say; we need standards. Never mind
that artistic opinions are subjective, and that an
individual's definition of quality art and acceptable speech
may not agree with a community's good taste. It's not
acceptable for those with minority opinions to create and
appreciate their art. It needs to be outlawed, repressed,
forced underground. A club-wielding mob is the only organism
with a valid opinion. We need judgment. We need standards.
   Free speech doesn't mean the right to government
subsidies, or the right to force your work upon an unwilling
community. It means the right not to agree with the
community; the right not to accept what its symbols have come
to represent; the right to choose what you read, say, view,
think; the right to be left alone.

   Bravo] It gives me great pleasure to see a voice of reason
and common sense. More people need to realize that community
standards are established so that we might have a stable
foundation in our society. They are not established to
repress individualism, but to give individuals the
opportunity to learn and grow.

   I hate to break the news to you, but community standards
have been in decline for years, torn apart by drugs,
homelessness and racial tension.
   You presume our homespun values are suddenly under attack
by leftist zealots. Some perspective may help. Basil
Patterson's displeasure with crudity could apply to 1970,
1980 or 1990. Foul language heard on the streets, on TV or in
music has long existed. When Trent Lott pontificates about
America "drifting into moral decay" it sounds as though
McCarthy hearings are back in session. These media-hungry
politicians fish for soundbites while ignoring the root
causes of despair.
   Rather than dwell on burning flags, why not examine the
causes of flag-burning, the daily horrors of poverty and
self-destruction that drive people to set fire to a
conveniently potent symbol.

   Your views on flag desecration, abortion, gay rights and
pornography as art show remarkable insight into today's
morass of liberal media distortion. I may not agree with your
every editorial view, but as a conservative Christian, I
appreciate your paper as a breath of fresh air.

   There is a choice available currently. You can go see 2
Live Crew (and be warned in advance of the explicit nature of
the performance) or you can stay away. The marketplace can
determine whether 2 Live Crew should be allowed to perform.
If the performance is foul and rude and unacceptable by
community standards, people will cease buying their product.
   You say: "It is sometimes called having a sense of
judgment." Your position would disallow me the opportunity to
make such a judgment for myself. What we are arguing is a
matter of taste, and there is no dispute in matters of taste.

   You seem to feel it's OK for government to enforce a
"sense of community" by arresting people who make phonograph
records or who protest against the government by attacking
its symbol (the flag). At the same time, you seem to think
it's a bad thing that in Romania printers of a newspaper --
"doubtless pushed by the government" -- interfere with the
publication of a newspaper critical of that government. I'm
sure that, for the moment, you would be able to draw some
lines differentiating these two positions. But I think that,
in the case of the U.S. Constitution, those sorts of lines
have to last for, and be more enduring, than the moment.
Let's let ideas compete in the marketplace, too.

   Liberal activists claim to oppose a constitutional
amendment allowing Congress and the states to prohibit
flag-burning because such an amendment would somehow
destabilize the Bill of Rights. But how stable is a 5-4
decision of the Supreme Court? One vote by an unelected
lawyer is hardly the bedrock upon which to base an allegedly
fundamental right of free expression for an entire nation.
   The liberal pundits opposed to the proposed flag amendment
conveniently ignore the ultimate provision of the Bill of
Rights: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
   At the heart of the flag-burning controversy is the
federal judiciary's usurpation of a power "reserved to the
States respectively, or to the people" by the 10th Amendment.
The proposed flag amendment simply states that, "The Congress
and the States shall have power to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States." Had this
amendment been drafted by James Madison, it may well have
read: "Among the powers reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people, is the power to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States." Far from
destabilizing the Bill of Rights, this new proposed amendment
merely reaffirms the ultimate provision of the Bill of Rights
in one specific context.
   The American system of government is based upon the
consent of the governed. The Declaration of Independence
proclaims that "Governments . . . deriv(e) their just powers
from the consent of the governed," the opening words of the
Constitution are "We the people," and Article V of the
Constitution requires the consent of three-fourths of the
States for amendments to the Constitution.
   If the states and the people wish to exercise their
constitutional power under the 10th Amendment to prohibit
flag-burning, and to amend the Constitution pursuant to
Article V so as to prevent the federal judiciary from further
usurping that power, the proposed flag amendment is by far
the most stability-enhancing measure for "We the people" to
protect our rights and powers under the Bill of Rights.

   I couldn't agree more with your seeing something
"preposterous" in stopping flag-burning by amending our
Constitution.
   Whatever became of our old-fashioned remedies such as
"Citizens-arrest" and the "Disturbing-the-peace" ordinances?
   Or have we patriotic, peaceful and law-abiding folk
somehow, somewhere along the way lost another constitutional
right?

   Every country has a flag. It is the Constitution that sets
the U.S. apart, and the Bill of Rights is the Constitution's
soul. To restrict the First Amendment to ban flag desecration
is to desecrate the Constitution. Ideals and principles are
more important than symbols.
