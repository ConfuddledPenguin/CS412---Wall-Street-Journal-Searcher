   CHICAGO -- Limited partners in a once-troubled syndication
sponsored by VMS Realty Partners would receive $10 million
under a settlement agreement presented to a federal judge
here. Each investor would receive about $78,000 for each
investment unit in what would be the first settlement in a
suit against the partnership sponsor.
   Some 20 cases filed against VMS have been consolidated
before federal Judge James B. Zagel. Attorneys for both
plaintiffs and defendants estimate that another 20 to 30
cases involving privately placed partnerships will be brought
against VMS this year. In addition, VMS, its individual
partners and several leading brokerage houses face a number
of suits from holders of publicly traded securities sponsored
by VMS.

   VMS, which claimed as recently as February to control some
$9 billion in real estate assets, raised $2.6 billion from
the public in the late 1980s, including $1.5 billion in
private placements.
   Investors in the 111 West Washington Street Association
Ltd. partnership had each put in $150,000 in principal and
about $52,000 in interest for each unit. Although investors
received tax write-offs, VMS had also promised returns of two
to three times the investment. The settlement comes as
something of a surprise as the syndicated property, the
Chicago Title &amp; Trust Building, was appraised in February at
$72 million, less than the amount needed to satisfy the first
and second mortgages on the property.
   But when VMS agreed to sell the downtown office building
to a unit of Rubloff Real Estate &amp; Capital Inc. for $91
million, VMS and the other general partners agreed to forgo
$10 million in profits to satisfy the settlement, according
to the settlement agreement. After recovering about $5
million advanced to the property to satisfy cash shortfalls,
the general partners will receive only about $680,000 in
profits under the settlement.
   Chicago-based Rubloff Real Estate is owned in part by ORIX
Corp., a Tokyo-based financial concern. The settlement is
contingent on the successful closing of the sale to Rubloff.
All of the funds paid to VMS may be subject to creditors'
claims.
   The settlement may prove to be anomalous, according to
attorneys for certain of the parties. Few of the other
properties syndicated by VMS appear to have sales prospects
as strong as the Chicago Title building. In addition, other
suits that name Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Cigna
Securities Inc. and the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp;
Horwath as defendants as well as VMS are said to be more
complex.
   Joel A. Stone, president and chief executive officer of
VMS, said the settlement was consistent with the minimum
payment and expectations set when the partnership was
structured five years ago. "We would have liked to have seen
more for the limited partners and for us," Mr. Stone said,
"But that was impossible considering the current state of
real estate prices in downtown Chicago."
