   NEW YORK -- After decades of fixation with the young and
upwardly mobile, U.S. brokerage firms are starting to romance
the 50-and-older crowd.
   With Wall Street's individual-investor business still
struggling, brokerage firms are waking up to the large pool
of disposable income controlled by older investors. These
investors have perhaps $7 trillion in wealth, and their pool
of investable money can do nothing but grow along with the
age of the populace.

   "In 2020, one in four Americans will be over the age of
65," predicts Joseph Grano, PaineWebber Group Inc.'s head of
sales and marketing. Brokerage firms are looking for any way
to appeal to such investors "because that's where the demand
is," he says.
   Age patterns are being studied as intensely as stock
charts these days at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's
biggest brokerage firm and one of several that run
"retirement seminars" to lure older investors. John Steffens,
president of Merrill Lynch's individual-investor operations,
predicts: "Probably for the next 25 years in this business,
we are really going to be demographically driven."
   Merrill Lynch, for example, says its average customer is
already 52 years old; the firm expects that average to move
up slightly in the next 10 years and jump to about 60 years
old in 2015.
   For some brokerage firms, the graying of their customer
base means they must prepare to sell more conservative
investments like certificates of deposit and municipal bonds.
But for others, part of the strategy is trying to persuade
older investors to loosen up and buy more stocks, rather than
low-risk kinds of bonds, by arguing that stocks provide
better long-term returns without undue danger.
   Henry Gottmann, head of sales and marketing at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., says: "These people are going to be
living longer, and the challenge is to make sure they don't
outlive their assets. . . . One of the things we have to do
with the mature market is educate them on the value of
investing in equities."
   For the most part, the richest investors have always been
older, of course. And with more people living longer, there
has long been talk among financial-services firms about how
they should adjust to the "graying of America."
   But until now, Wall Street has continued to focus on the
upwardly mobile younger crowd that came to be known in the
1980s as "yuppies." Most advertisements depicting investors
have used younger models, like a recent pitch from Charles
Schwab &amp; Co. featuring a trio of 30ish investors, one holding
a basketball. Brokerage firms' sales ranks seem to be filled
with 25-year-old brokers whose bosses often aren't much
older. Industry executives say that too often there seems to
be little attention paid to the needs of older customers.
   Brokerage firms have largely done only scattershot
attempts at marketing to the mature. That has left the field
open to money managers such as Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark Inc.,
which since 1985 has offered seven mutual funds through the
American Association of Retired Persons, a program that has
raised more than $4 billion in assets.
   But when Wall Street has homed in on retirement-age
investors, the results have been encouraging.
   A few months ago, PaineWebber sent out 800,000 pieces of
"direct mail" offering potential investors a free guide to
retirement choices. The response may wind up being the best
ever for a PaineWebber mailing. The 10% initial response rate
has led to about 8,000 new customers so far, who are
generating 40% more in revenue than customers acquired in
earlier mailings, PaineWebber says.
   Now Shearson, under new management sent down by its parent
American Express Co., is gearing up a program on "marketing
to the mature" for its almost 10,000 brokers. Shearson will
follow with an advertising blitz by early autumn targeted at
older investors. And it will use older brokers to advise
younger ones about how to serve mature clients, Shearson
executives say.
   How far will brokerage firms go with this older-investor
push? Merrill Lynch early this year introduced a telephone
stock-buying system for the deaf and hearing-impaired.
PaineWebber may, among other things, increase the radio ads
it runs on classical-music stations to entice mature
investors while they relax. And Shearson is circulating its
first "large-type" prospectus for an investment product.
   Merrill's new investor guide, "Enjoy Your Retirement
Years," features a sentimental illustration of a grandfather
and grandson. In case investors miss the message, the inside
cover carries a large-sized quotation from the 17th-century
author Anne Bradstreet. "Youth is the time of getting, middle
age of improving, and old age of spending," the quotation
reads.
   The closest thing to a guru for Wall Street's
older-investor push is Ken Dychtwald, a consultant and
lecturer on the aging of America. Firms including Merrill,
PaineWebber, Shearson and American Express have paid for his
advice. Mr. Dychtwald says Wall Street should be doing such
things as bringing retired brokers back to work part time to
cater to investors their own age.
   "Brokerage houses have to do a much better job showing
their best customers, those over 50, are being serviced
well," says Mr. Dychtwald, chairman of Age Wave Inc. in
Emeryville, Calif. He says there's no U.S. industry that
could "stand to profit more from the aging of our country
than financial services. But there may not be an industry
that has paid less attention" to it.
   (The Chicago Sun-Times last month dropped Mr. Dychtwald as
a free-lance columnist on aging, accusing him of copying
material from two stories that appeared earlier in the New
York Times. Mr. Dychtwald calls one of the incidents
"inadvertent" and says that in the other he believed he
didn't have to credit the Times for a Dartmouth medical
school study it printed. The brokerage firms he works with
say they accept his explanation for the incidents.)
   At the same time Wall Street is trying to appeal to the
older-than-50 crowd, it is also using the aging of America as
a marketing gimmick to lure investors of all ages.
Mutual-fund companies, including Fidelity Investments, are
marketing specialized funds that supposedly will do well as
the population gets older (funds with health-care and leisure
stocks, for example). Some firms urge investors to "ride the
age wave" and buy stocks benefiting from travel, such as Walt
Disney Co., AMR Corp. and Delta Air Lines.
   The one thing that experts say Wall Street shouldn't do is
suddenly start running ads depicting groups of gray-haired
investors. Shearson's Mr. Gottmann says, "You are not
advertising to people who think they are older. You are
advertising to people who think they are younger and will
live longer."
   Adds Mr. Steffens, Merrill's individual-investor head:
"People portray themselves as being 10 to 20 years younger
than they are. We've found that in some cases, portraying
older people in print ads tends to be extremely ineffective
and in some cases turns them off."
