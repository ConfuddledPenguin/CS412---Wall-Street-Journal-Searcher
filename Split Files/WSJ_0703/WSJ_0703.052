   BEDMINSTER, N.J. -- NUI Corp. said it has offered an early
retirement incentive to about 6.5% of its work force in an
effort to pare operating expenses.
   NUI, the parent of natural gas distributors Elizabethtown
(N.J.) Gas Co. and City Gas Co. of Florida, said it could
incur a pretax cost of about $2 million if all eligible
employees accepted the offer. But it said it hopes to reduce
costs by $5.5 million. It said about 50 of the 770 NUI and
Elizabethtown employees would be eligible; City Gas employees
have a separate pension plan.

   Under the offer, all employees covered under the pension
plan and born before Jan. 1, 1932, would be eligible. The
company's incentives include crediting eligible employees
with three more years credited service for purposes of
calculating their pension benefits. NUI said eligible
employees have until Sept. 30 to choose.
