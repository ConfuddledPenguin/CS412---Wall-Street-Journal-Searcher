   HOUSTON -- The credit ratings of First City Bancorp. of
Texas Inc., a bank holding company, and its lead bank, First
City, Texas-Houston, have been placed under review for
possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   The review could affect about $641 million in securities,
including First City Bancorp. senior long-term debt, now
Ba-1, and its subordinated debt, now Ba-2; and First City
National long-term deposit obligations, now Baa-2, and
short-term deposit obligations, now Prime-3.

   Moody's cited First City Bancorp.'s announcement of an
increase in nonperforming loans, which was expected to be
$200 million by the end of the second quarter, up from $140
million at the end of 1989. But a First City Bancorp.
spokesman said the company "looks forward to the opportunity
to discuss its loan portfolio" and believes that a thorough
review will confirm that current ratings should be
maintained.
