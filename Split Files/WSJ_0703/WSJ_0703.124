   NEW YORK -- Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. has suspended production of the movie "Radio Flyers" and
relieved the film's writer of his job as director.
   Although Columbia said it expects to find a new director
shortly and resume the production, the problems at "Radio
Flyers" are a setback for Columbia, which stunned the
industry when it paid more than $1 million to writer David
Mickey Evans for his screenplay and agreed to let him direct
the picture even though the 27-year-old virtual unknown had
never directed a movie.

   "Radio Flyers" is also one of the first movies to be put
into production by the new management team of Peter Guber and
Jon Peters, who are scrambling to restart production at the
moribund studio. The project was among the first in the
recent spate of high-profile screenplays that have sparked
bidding wars among Hollywood studios, which are now paying
more than $2 million for certain screenplays that might have
fetched less than $500,000 only a year ago.
   In the case of "Radio Flyers," Time Warner Inc.'s Warner
Bros. unit was eager to acquire the highly-regarded
screenplay, but it wanted to put veteran director Dick
Donner, who directed "Lethal Weapon," in charge of the film.
But Mr. Evans insisted that he direct the film himself, which
Warner executives balked at, so he sold it instead to
Columbia after Mr. Peters agreed to pay him $600,000 for the
movie and another $500,000 to direct it.
   Filming of "Radio Flyers" began June 16, but according to
people familiar with the production, it was troubled from the
start and the so-called "dailies" -- initial footage from the
day's filming -- made it clear the movie wasn't working. The
film was being produced for Columbia by Stonebridge
Productions, one of the film companies associated with actor
Michael Douglas.
   Mr. Evans couldn't be reached for comment, and Stonebridge
declined to comment. Columbia released an unusual statement
that said "Radio Flyers" is "one of the greatest screenplays
we have ever read," and "in our spirit of affection for the
screenplay, Stonebridge, with Columbia Pictures, gave David
Mickey Evans the opportunity to participate directorially. We
hope David will stay on the film to be of great value as one
of the producers."
   "Radio Flyers" is the story of two young brothers who
escape into their fantasy worlds to cope with a harsh life
and abuse by their stepfather. Among its stars are Rosanna
Arquette and Joe Mantegna.
   So far, Columbia doesn't have much else in the pipeline.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters scrapped almost all the movies that
had been developed by former studio chief Dawn Steel. The
Columbia unit has virtually nothing for release this summer
other than the Aug. 10 opening of "Flatliners," from the
Steel regime. The Tri-Star Pictures unit will provide
virtually all the revenue with its distribution arrangements
with Carolco Pictures, producers of the current hit "Total
Recall" and upcoming "Air America." Tri-Star is also
releasing "The Freshman," starring Marlon Brando, later this
month.
   Columbia will soon begin shooting "Hudson Hawke" with
Bruce Willis, and it also recently acquired the movie "The
Prince of Tides" from MGM/UA Communications Co., which
originally agreed to produce a film-based on the best-selling
novel -- starring Barbra Streisand. Columbia acquired the
film as a result of Ms. Streisand's longstanding relationship
with Mr. Peters, who was once her hairdresser and boyfriend.
The film, which also stars Nick Nolte, is currently in
production.
   Since Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took the helm at Columbia
earlier this year, they have bought a number of expensive
film scripts, though it is not clear all of them will be
produced. Last spring, they hired producer Frank Price -- who
had previously run both Columbia Pictures and MCA Inc.'s
Universal Pictures -- to run the Columbia unit again, and
lured Mike Medavoy away from Orion Pictures to run the
Tri-Star Pictures unit. Mr. Medavoy and Mr. Price were given
autonomy to chose their own productions. Mr. Price, for
example, recently started production on a sequel to "The Blue
Lagoon," a project he had been working on before being
rehired by Columbia.
