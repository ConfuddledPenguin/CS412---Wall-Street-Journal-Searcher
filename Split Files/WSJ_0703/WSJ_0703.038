   TW HOLDINGS Inc., Spartanburg, S.C., said it entered a
note purchase agreement with a group led by Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. for $160 million of mortgage financing for 240 Denny's
restaurants, which TW owns and operates.The company said the
mortgage notes will bear interest at 11% for a 10-year term.
Financing of the notes, which were placed in the Japanese
market, is expected to close within two weeks. The net
proceeds of about $120 million will be used to reduce senior
bank debt. The company said it signed a letter of agreement
separately under which Financial Security Assurance will
guarantee $225 million of mortgage notes for 398 Hardee's and
Quincy's Family Steakhouse restaurants that TW owns and
