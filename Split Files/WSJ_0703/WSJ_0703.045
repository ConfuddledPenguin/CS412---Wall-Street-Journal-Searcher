   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. paid $800 million to
the Internal Revenue Service to resolve a long-running
dispute over windfall profit taxes on the company's Alaskan
North Slope crude oil production from 1980 to 1985.
   The IRS had sought roughly $1.8 billion in back taxes and
interest. It filed a "notice of proposed deficiency" in 1988
seeking $577 million plus interest for alleged unpaid taxes
for the years 1980 through 1983. In April, the agency filed a
similar notice for $212 million plus interest for 1984 and
1985.

   An Arco spokesman said the payment won't have a material
effect on the oil and energy company's earnings. At the end
of 1989, the company's reserves included $756 million for
unspecified deferred liabilities. The spokesman said the
company set aside additional reserves in the first quarter
that "more than cover" the $800 million payment.
   The dispute involved a tax levied on crude oil above
certain price levels starting in 1980. The agency and Arco
disagreed on the proper method for constructing a taxable
"wellhead" price for the crude, which requires certain
assumptions about transportation costs and other factors.
Determining that price was complicated, as most of the oil is
produced and transported before it is sold.
   An internal IRS document from 1987 indicated that the
agency was studying whether several oil companies overstated
costs of transporting oil to the continental U.S. and thus
depressed the imputed value of the crude. The methods Arco
used for several years were believed to result in a lower
price than those used by other Alaska oil producers.
   Arco maintained its calculations were appropriate but
changed its method in early 1985 to a weighted average value
reported by other northern Alaska oil producers. The Arco
spokesman said the windfall tax ceased to apply with the
plunge in oil prices in 1985, and the tax was repealed in
1988.
   An IRS spokesman in Washington declined to discuss the
issue, citing taxpayer confidentiality. Arco has settled a
dispute with the Alaska Department of Revenue for production
taxes.
