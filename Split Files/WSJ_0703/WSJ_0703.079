   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
expelled Brandon Securities &amp; Investments Inc. and barred a
principal of the firm from membership for allegedly raising
more than $1.5 million from investors and then misapplying or
misappropriating the funds.
   The NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter markets, also fined the North Providence,
R.I., firm $1.5 million. Brandon, a subsidiary of Brandon
Securities Inc., and the principal, Ernest E. Michaud of
Kingston, R.I., consented to the sanctions without admitting
or denying wrongdoing.

   The NASD alleged that Mr. Michaud also supplied customers
with fictitious statements containing false representations
concerning their investments. Mr. Michaud also didn't respond
when the NASD requested information, the agency charged.
   Neither the firm nor Mr. Michaud could be reached for
comment.
   In a May 22 letter from the NASD's Boston office to its
general counsel's office in Washington, the agency said,
"Because of the egregious nature of the allegations in
issue," the NASD "notified the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
state of Rhode Island."
   The NASD staff "is assisting the {Federal Bureau of
Investigation} in relation to a criminal investigation," the
letter said. "We are also assisting the state of Rhode Island
Securities Division in their investigation."
