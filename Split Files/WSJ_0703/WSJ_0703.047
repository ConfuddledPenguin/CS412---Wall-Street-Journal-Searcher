   Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty
woman with a torch, whose flame Is imprisoned lightning, and
her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows
worldwide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged
harbor that twin cities frame. "Keep ancient lands, your
storied pomp]" cries she With silent lips. "Give me your
tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe
free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these,
the homeless, tempest tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the
golden door]
   -- Emma Lazarus

   This Fourth of July the citizens of the United States will
reflect pride in their nation, a successful land of
successful immigrants. These are largely happy times for most
Americans.
   Yet other, less noble images lurk in the background of our
July 4th celebrations: the guards who patrol our 2,000-mile
border with Mexico or reports by government agencies that the
nation's immigration law has indeed caused widespread hiring
discrimination against non-whites. We read that Southeast
Asian nations and British officials in Hong Kong have warned
the United States that they may no longer provide first
asylum for the flood of refugees that still flee from
Vietnam.
   The question for Independence Day is which symbol
represents this country's attitude toward the modern
equivalent of our desperate immigrant forbears -- the Statue
of Liberty or the stiff arm of refusal and prejudice?
   The law of our land is now the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act, which seeks to hound "illegal" immigrants and
persists in sending anyone who hires them to jail or fining
them. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had
assessed millions of dollars in fines against employers under
this law. Four years ago today, we offered an alternative. We
wrote, "If Washington still wants to `do something' about
immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment:
There shall be open borders."
   We added, "Perhaps this policy is overly ambitious in
today's world, but the U.S. became the world's envy by
trumpeting precisely this kind of heresy." A policy of
liberal borders is no more or less radical than the notion
that a democracy founded in a new, wild world could become
the envy of all nations.
   Without question, many free nations have done much the
past 15 years to absorb the world's refugees. But however
grim and arduous this task, there can be no justification for
abandoning it, and them. The price of freedom does not lie
only in defending it through force of arms but also in
proving its worth by extending it to the unfree. What is
required now when many are tired of helping the huddled
masses is leadership.
   The consensus in Congress after the immigration law passed
was that it would be modified if it proved discriminatory.
Instead, there has been talk of creating an improved personal
"document system," which sounds very much like a national
identity card. Some elected official -- Republican or
Democrat -- has to provide the leadership that will eliminate
the abuse of immigrants.
   We have no illusions that this will be easy. There will be
opposition. Backers of immigration limits are a coalition
built on unattractive arguments. Nativists cast their
opposition to immigration in terms of protecting a cultural
status quo. Some of them think legislation is needed to make
English an official language, though surely the growth of
English as an international language is likely to make such
parochial laws unnecessary. Limits-to-growth types, prevalent
along the coast between New York and Washington, say we've
run out of space.
   Recall that when the Statue of Liberty was unveiled, an
earlier generation of nativists had said that the Irish
pouring into the U.S. would never assimilate. Their English
was, well, unEnglish. Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy
appear to have disproved these intensely held fears.
   The past year has seen a number of works published
allaying some of the most frequently heard criticisms and
fears of the harm immigrants pose to U.S. society. George
Borjas of the University of California at Santa Barbara
compiled "Friends or Strangers: The Impact of Immigrants on
the U.S. Economy," and Julian Simon continued his research in
"The Economic Consequences of Immigration." The President's
Economic Report this year advocated more liberal immigration
restrictions, because of immigration's benefits.
   Our support for more immigration isn't entirely for the
benefit of the immigrants alone. This nation needs the
rejuvenation that waves of new Americans bring. Latins,
Vietnamese and West Indians are the new Irish, Italians and
Poles. We must guard against slipping into the self-satisfied
view that we are good enough as is, no more need apply or
trespass on the American experiment.
   The yearning masses offer us their talents, ambitions and
obviously unbreakable spirit. In return, we acquire a renewed
view of our own difficult past and, if we are true to that
past, a reason for confidence in our future.
