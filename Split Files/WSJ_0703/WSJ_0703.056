   Only Fuels Racism

   Hodding Carter III's attempt ("They Love Old Glory Now --
They Reviled It Back Then," Viewpoint, June 21) to castigate
the opposition by resorting to an ideology of equality that
has fueled racism is as skewed as applying Justice Holmes's
clear-and-present-danger doctrine to flagburning. Just as Mr.
Carter's incomplete understanding of the flag as the "symbol"
of the Bill of Rights prevents him, as it does a majority of
the Supreme Court, from recognizing that the flag should be
protected as an instrument of sovereignty, his egalitarianism
prevents him from understanding that the price of imposing
"equality" on the states was the loss of their freedom of
self-determination.

   ---
   I say three cheers for someone with guts and clear
thinking. I hope this column helped persuade the cowards and
the wishy-washy, muddled-thinking congressmen and senators to
stand up and be counted among those who oppose this
amendment. Opposing this amendment sends a message to those
who would tamper with, and whittle away, our rights under our
glorious Constitution, and will help courageous lawmakers be
re-elected.
