   THE DRUG THA, being tested by Warner-Lambert Co. for
treating Alzheimer's disease, can cause an increase in liver
enzymes in some patients, a sign of liver damage. The
condition is reversible when the drug's use is stopped and
can be eliminated at low doses. Yesterday's edition
incorrectly said the drug affected kidney enzymes.

Alzheimer's Disease Gets Contradictory Reports" -- WSJ May 2,

   AMGEN Inc. recently lost a round in patent infringement
litigation involving erythropoietin, an anti-anemia drug,
against Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan. Yesterday's OTC
Focus column mistakenly said that Amgen had won and that
Genetics Institute Inc. also was involved. Genetics Institute
is involved in a separate suit with Amgen.
