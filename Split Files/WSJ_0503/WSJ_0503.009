   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration and its European
allies are expected to propose scrapping plans for a new
generation of short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany,
according to administration officials.
   In the face of persistent complaints from West Germany and
other allies, Secretary of State James Baker is likely to put
the proposal on the table today in Brussels during a meeting
with foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance,
the officials said. The proposal also is expected to call for
negotiations with the Kremlin about eliminating nuclear
artillery shells from both U.S. and Russian forces stationed
in Europe.

   Once the U.S. formally proposes to kill plans for
short-range missiles to be deployed in West Germany, the idea
is certain to be embraced by the rest of the allies. West
German officials especially have criticized the Bush
administration for proceeding with plans to field such
weapons, asserting that they no longer are necessary in light
of the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.
   White House aides are considering having Mr. Bush announce
the new alliance position at a commencement speech in
Oklahoma tomorrow, but they may decide to go public with it
earlier.
   The White House may couch the move as a significant new
proposal intended to show its good faith and prod the Kremlin
to make similar concessions. But it has been clear for some
time that building European and congressional opposition
almost certainly would prevent the administration from
fielding a replacement for the Lance missile in any case.
   The Pentagon previously proposed spending about $500
million over the next five years to develop the new weapon,
and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has maintained that the
U.S. shouldn't move on its own to scrap those plans. Now, the
administration appears ready to make an important symbolic
gesture by announcing the new policy and embracing
congressional efforts to spend those funds elsewhere.
   The administration's gambit could provide a domestic
political boost for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who
is likely to portray it as a sign that his sweeping
arms-control proposals and other policies to improve
East-West relations are showing results. More important,
NATO's willingness to forgo short-range nuclear missiles is
bound to help reassure Kremlin leaders that a unified Germany
wouldn't pose a military threat against Russia.
   As part of any agreement covering a replacement for the
Lance, Pentagon officials have consistently argued that NATO
should be allowed to retain aircraft-launched missiles in its
arsenal. Because congressional opposition to such missiles is
considerably weaker, Mr. Baker isn't likely to include them
in his proposal.
