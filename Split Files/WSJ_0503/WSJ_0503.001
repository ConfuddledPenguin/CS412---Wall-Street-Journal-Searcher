   WASHINGTON -- The federal government plans next week to
borrow a record amount for any regular quarterly refunding
operation, in part to help finance savings-and-loan bailouts.
   The Treasury said it plans to sell $30.5 billion of notes
and bonds to raise about $12.4 billion in cash and redeem
about $18.1 billion in maturing government securities. The
borrowing will be $500 million higher than the last two
refundings, the government said.

   The new securities will consist of:
   -- $10.5 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned next
Tuesday.
   -- $10 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned next
Wednesday.
   -- $10 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned next
Thursday.
   The three-year notes will mature on May 15, 1993, the
10-year notes on May 15, 2000, and the 30-year bonds on May
15, 2020.
   For the current quarter, the government estimates a net
borrowing need of $12.6 billion, assuming a $30 billion cash
balance at the end of June. That is a considerably greater
borrowing need than for the same quarter last year, when an
unexpectedly high level of tax receipts poured into the
Treasury's coffers. At a news conference yesterday to
announce next week's refunding, Robert Glauber, the
Treasury's undersecretary for finance, refused to comment on
tax receipts this year.
   Mr. Glauber said the $12.6 billion net borrowing
requirement for the second quarter includes borrowing to
finance the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set up to
manage failing savings and loans, under thrift bail-out
legislation.
   Including next week's refunding, the Treasury will have
raised $2.6 billion of its net borrowing requirement. The
remaining $10 billion could be raised through regular sales
of three-month and six-month Treasury bills and one-year
notes, or through a planned sale of a two-year note in May
and a five-year, two-month note in early June, Mr. Glauber
said.
