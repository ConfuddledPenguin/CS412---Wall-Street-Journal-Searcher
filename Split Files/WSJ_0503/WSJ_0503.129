   Shell Oil is no Exxon. Honest. At least, that appears to
be the message in a Shell magazine-ad insert that gives
"environmental tips" amid photos of a forest, a fuzzy rabbit,
a deer.
   Shell's marketing idea isn't terribly original, as anyone
who has opened his eyes over the past few months can attest.
It joins scores of other companies that have grabbed onto
environmentalism as a marketing cry. Companies like American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph; Dow Chemical for its Handi-Wrap
plastic wrap; and American Enviro Products, maker of Bunnies
"biodegradable" disposable diapers, have latched onto the
environment as a marketing gimmick. To hear them tell it,
every day is Earth Day.

   But so many companies have rallied around the
environmental cry that now, some ad executives are detecting
a backlash by consumers. A skeptical public is starting to
wonder just how meaningful many of the claims actually are.
Government investigations into some "green" claims, and news
reports about the spotty environmental track records behind
others, have burst the green balloon to some extent. And
consumers in many cases are just plain getting sick of the
excess.
   "The guy who on Monday morning figured out the environment
is a big issue and put it on his packaging, that isn't going
to mean anything," says Robert Schmidt, chairman of ad agency
Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver. "You're seeing people
saying `baloney' -- usually about products whose
{environmental} claims are baloney."
   "I think there's definitely some backlash there already,"
agrees a spokeswoman for Ramada International Hotels &amp;
Resorts, which is about to launch an environmental marketing
program of its own. "People are very skeptical of anyone
coming forward with a claim like this."
   The backlash comes as even more environmental claims are
about to roll out. Ramada's quest to become the first
environment-friendly hotel chain, for example, breaks next
week. Ads brag about the biodegradable detergents used at the
Sydney Renaissance Hotel in Australia, and boast that the
Reef Resort in North Queensland, Australia, was built
"without a single tree being lifted or felled." Ramada is
also launching a program to encourage individual hotels to
recycle cans and bottles, to conserve energy and to cut back
on water usage.
   Yet Ramada's claims appear to be a bit, well, premature.
The hefty press kit announcing the environmental program
isn't printed on recycled paper. For that matter, most Ramada
hotels don't recycle bottles, don't use biodegradable
detergents, and don't do much of anything else that's
particularly environmentally conscious.
   The spokeswoman insists, though, that that doesn't affect
the campaign's credibility. "We aren't saying we're
lily-white right now," she says. "We're saying we're going to
make every effort to get to that point, and this is our first
step. We aren't trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes
here."
   Ad executives say too many companies, though, are slapping
environmental claims on products that are misleading or that
are blatant marketing gimmicks. "To some degree it's become
trendy. It's so transparent . . . people are smart enough to
see through those things," says Louise McNamee, president of
Della Femina McNamee WCRS.
   Indeed, a group of eight attorneys general has been
investigating a number of environmental claims, and some
makers of trash bags, food wraps, and other products have
abandoned such claims. Mobil Corp.'s Mobil Chemical unit
deleted degradability claims from its Hefty trash bag
packaging, while First Brands Corp. removed some
degradability claims from its Glad trash bags. Dow Chemical's
DowBrands also removed a "photodegradability" claim from its
Handi-Wrap because, a spokeswoman says, "it's confusing to
the consumer . . . we don't want to make a claim they don't
quite understand."
   Critics have also focused on the green claims of big
industrial companies, like oil and chemical companies. A
spokesman for Shell, whose ad insert on the environment gives
tips like "avoid unnecessary idling," responds that the
booklet "has been extremely well-received."
   AT&amp;T couldn't be reached for comment.
   At American Enviro, which the attorneys general are
investigating for its "biodegradability" claims regarding
Bunnies diapers, President Robert Chickering said, "We're
making biodegradable material and using the latest
technologies. That's sound." But he added, "If a company
comes out and uses the word `biodegradable' and in fact
hasn't done anything to adjust its product, I think that's
wrong." He said companies serious about the environment
should tell consumers specifically what it is they're doing:
"We aren't showing pictures of a deer in the woods."
   Levine Huntley's Mr. Schmidt believes that the wave of
environmental claims will eventually thin out. Ultimately, he
says, the claims will be confined to companies that really
are concentrating on making environmentally-safe products.
But, he cautions, "You'll probably see more before you see
less. You always see excess until you see a shakeout. You're
going to see more and more until it doesn't mean anything."
   Yet to longtime environmentalists, even empty
environmental marketing claims -- from companies that are
simply joining the crowd by touting the latest buzzword --
are better than nothing.
   "I am cynical about the bandwagon approach," says Della
Femina McNamee's Ms. McNamee. "But if it gets people to {act
more responsibly}, so be it. So what if it's trendy?"
