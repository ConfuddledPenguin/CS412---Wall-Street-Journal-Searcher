   A little girl points to a picture in her textbook. "Is
this a fuego?" she asks. The teacher replies, " Si, por favor
hable en Espanol."
   In schools all across America, Hispanic children eager and
ready to learn English are being taught their lessons in
Spanish instead. Their story -- and its disturbing
consequences for the children and society -- is told by
Rosalie Pedaline Porter in "Forked Tongue: The Politics of
Bilingual Education" (Basic Books, 288 pages, $22.95).

   Ms. Porter has spent nearly 20 years in the field of
bilingual education, first as a teacher, then as the
administrator of a successful program for
non-English-speaking children in Newton, Mass., and finally
as an outspoken critic of bilingual education. Her
realization that bilingual education is an ineffective method
to teach English came slowly and at considerable risk to her
career. An early bilingual education enthusiast, Ms. Porter
hoped to help a new generation of non-English-speaking
youngsters avoid what she'd gone through as a frightened,
six-year-old Italian immigrant, forced to learn English
unassisted. But Ms. Porter's enthusiasm waned as she tried to
put into practice the theories she'd learned for her
undergraduate degree in bilingual education.
   Her first assignment was teaching kindergarten and
elementary school in Springfield, Mass. Most of her day was
spent teaching the children in Spanish. She recalls dutifully
asking a young boy to identify a green box: "Juan, que color
es este?" she asked, and he replied, "Green." The boy's
response wasn't surprising, because most of the students were
Puerto Ricans born in Massachusetts, not recent immigrants.
They came from homes in which Spanish and English were
spoken. Nonetheless, Ms. Porter toed the line. "Verde," she
corrected the boy, and he repeated, "Green." Says Ms. Porter:
"I came to feel that I was going about things the wrong way
around, as if I were deliberately holding back the learning
of English."
   Eventually, she began introducing more English instruction
into the school day -- and the children thrived. Ms. Porter
developed her methods further when she became an
administrator in the Newton school system, which provided
intensive English-language instruction for
non-English-speaking children. There, her efforts to teach
students English provoked the enmity of the
bilingual-education bureaucracy. She became the target of a
vindictive campaign to impugn her personal integrity and
discredit the Newton program. It was only over strenuous
objections from the state education department's bilingual
bureaucracy that Ms. Porter's critique of bilingual education
ultimately earned her a doctoral degree from the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst.
   According to bilingual advocates, non-English-speaking
children must develop a firm foundation in their native
language before they can learn academic subjects in a new
language. Mexican-American children in California, for
example, spend as little as 20 minutes a day being instructed
in English while they learn most of their lessons in Spanish.
   The problem with bilingual education theory, according to
Ms. Porter and a growing list of critics, is that it ignores
the most important principle of education: The more time a
child spends on a given task, the more likely he or she is to
remember the lesson. Hispanic children who spend hours a day
listening to Spanish may develop better skills in that
language, but they're not likely to learn English as well as
students who are given intensive help learning the new
language. Because virtually all these students will spend
their lives in the U.S., bilingual education may ultimately
deprive them of the ability to earn a decent living or move
into the social mainstream.
   So why do ethnic leaders promote bilingual education? Ms.
Porter thinks they're motivated by their own desire to
preserve Hispanic culture and language in the face of the
inevitable pressure to assimilate. As she reminds readers,
such attempts are usually futile: Witness the fate of Gaelic
in Ireland, where the government has spent years trying to
save the country's ancient language by mandating its teaching
in the public schools, to no avail. Ms. Porter also believes
that bilingual bureaucrats want to protect their own jobs and
exercise control over the Hispanic community.
   Despite the program's shortcomings, mainstream
policy-makers continue to support bilingual education.
Granted, the federal government recently increased its
funding for programs that emphasize more English instruction.
But most programs are supported by state and local funds, and
at those levels, the trend is to expand native-language
programs. A proposed New York state plan, already given
preliminary approval, will extend native-language instruction
from elementary through high school and will allow some
Hispanic youngsters to take graduation exams in Spanish.
   In reacting to this trend, Ms. Porter is at her best when
speaking from personal experience. She is weakest when she
veers off onto discussions of education research, much of it
from other countries. And she spends too much time trying to
refute the assertions of bilingual-education theorists, when
her most eloquent case rests in her descriptions of what goes
on in bilingual classrooms. By sharing her own experiences,
Ms. Porter may succeed in exposing the inanity of current
bilingual education policy.
