   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded its debt ratings for Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. of
Atlanta, and Sovran Financial Corp. of Norfolk, Va.
   The two companies are in the process of merging to form
Avantor Financial Corp. The $4.7 billion transaction, which
will create the nation's 14th-largest banking company, is
expected to be completed in the third quarter.

   Moody's also lowered the ratings on the long-term deposits
of the superregional banking company's subsidiary banks.
   The rating agency said the actions, which affect about
$750 million in securities, reflect the combined $47 billion
institution's significant exposure to overbuilt real estate
markets. Citizens recently reported first-quarter profit fell
28% to $41.6 million, or 64 cents a share, primarily because
of a $54.8 million charge for problem loans.
   The company's senior debt was downgraded to single-A-2
from single-A-1; subordinated debt to single-A-3 from
single-A-2; shelf registration to (P)single-A-2 from
(P)single-A-1, and preferred stock to single-A-2 from
single-A-1.
   Sovran's senior debt was downgraded to single-A-2 from
single-A-1; its medium-term notes to single-A-2 from
single-A-1; subordinated debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2;
subordinated capital notes to single-A-3 from single-A-2, and
shelf registration to (P)single-A-2 from (P)single-A-1.
