   Newspapers are giving horoscope readers some advice
lately, much to the chagrin of astrologers.
   Taking a tip from a group of self-described skeptics, some
30 newspapers over the past few years have added disclaimers
to their horoscope columns. Most sound like this tag found in
the Morning Advocate of Baton Rouge, La.: "The horoscope, an
entertainment feature, is not based on scientific fact."

   That's an outrage to professional stargazers. Syndicated
astrologer Sydney Omarr, himself once a wire service
reporter, says the disclaimers are "so ridiculous it makes me
ashamed of my background in journalism."
   Horoscope labeling is the brainchild of Paul Kurtz,
chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of
Claims of the Paranormal, a Buffalo, N.Y., group that
delights in debunking. In 1985 and again in 1988 -- inspired
by Nancy Reagan's cosmic consultations -- the committee sent
letters to every daily newspaper in America, urging that
editors warn readers not to plan their lives around planet
placement.
   "If you examine the claims scientifically, astrology is
shown to have no evidential support at all," says Mr. Kurtz,
a philosopher at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
   Agreeing, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch added a disclaimer a
few years back. "I don't think we should encourage people
they're getting the scoop on their future," says Jim
Creighton, features director.
   Many papers don't take horoscopes too seriously. Frederick
G. Eaton, managing editor of the Daily Telegram in Adrian,
Mich., (which runs a disclaimer) recalls how the paper once
wasn't able to get the horoscope for a few weeks. Mr. Eaton
simply filled the space with some months-old forecasts. No
catastrophes were reported.
   Astrologers wonder how in the world critics think they
know so much. Joan Quigley, the former first lady's
astrologer, contends that "astrology is scientific in this
sense: It's based on astronomy, the same way a doctor bases
his diagnosis on lab reports and the economist bases his
predictions on computer-gathered statistics. Only I think
astrology is more reliable than those two."
   Mr. Omarr finds the disclaimer trend darkly menacing.
"Once you permit this kind of thought control and prejudice,"
he says, "it will go over into other areas. . . . Tomorrow
it'll be the bridge column, then the financial column."
