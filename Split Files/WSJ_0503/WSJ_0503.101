   Ply Gem Industries Inc. reported a first-quarter net loss
of $1.7 million, or 16 cents a share, reflecting the highly
seasonal business of SNE Enterprises, acquired by Ply Gem in
March 1989.
   The New York-based manufacturer of home improvement
products earned $2.2 million, or 20 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue increased 23% to $121.3 million, from $98.3
million.

   Ply Gem said its financial condition remains strong. The
company said SNE normally posts a large first-quarter loss
because of its seasonal window-and-door product line. Ply Gem
added that an increasingly higher percentage of its sales and
earnings will occur during the busy spring and summer
remodeling periods.
   The company also authorized the purchase of as many as
500,000 shares of Ply Gem stock over an unspecified period.
The company currently has 10.5 million common shares
outstanding.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ply Gem closed at $7.50, up 25 cents.
