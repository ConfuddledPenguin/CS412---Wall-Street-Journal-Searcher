   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose yesterday against the mark as
an agreement was announced for monetary unification of the
two Germanys, but the U.S. unit lost some ground against the
yen on a recovery in Tokyo stock prices.
   Sterling was little changed against the dollar ahead of
today's local council elections in Britain. Though the
elections don't involve Parliament, they are seen as a
barometer of the strength of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and are expected to result in losses for her governing
Conservative Party.

   Traders said the mark lost ground despite the announcement
of terms for the monetary unification because conditions in
West Germany will remain unsettled while the plan is
implemented. Earlier, some market participants had expected
that agreement on terms would benefit the mark by removing
uncertainties.
   Under the plan, which was announced in Bonn and East
Berlin early in the New York trading day, most East Germans
will be able to exchange 4,000 East German marks in cash and
savings for West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate, while those
60 years old and over will be able to change 6,000 East
German marks at 1-to-1. Those 14 years old and under will be
able to change 2,000 East German marks at the 1-to-1 rate.
   The agreement, negotiated Monday and Tuesday by a
commission of East German and West German officials, differed
slightly from the original proposal by the government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which had offered to exchange 4,000
East German marks at the 1-to-1 rate for each East German and
contained no special provisions for different age groups. The
accord will take effect on July 2.
   The Germans also established a new official 2-to-1 rate
for East German-West German mark transactions, replacing the
3-to-1 official rate in force since Jan. 1, and agreed to
convert East German liabilities at a 2-to-1 rate. Safeguards
against speculation in East German marks were also set.
   Participants said the market will be focusing on the West
German central bank in the wake of the announcement of the
pact, watching to see when it raises interest rates to offset
inflationary pressures.
   But they cautioned that the central bank isn't likely to
raise rates right away, preferring to wait and see how many
marks are changed at 1-to-1 and what the East Germans do with
them, developments that won't be completely clear for some
time.
   In the meantime, the mark will weaken a bit against the
dollar and other major currencies as participants take
advantage of the uncertainty in West Germany to sell the West
German unit, said Andrew Busch, senior mark dealer at Harris
Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Mr. Busch said another source of trouble for the mark
yesterday came from a second round of warning strikes by IG
Metall, West Germany's powerful workers union. About 200
plants in North Rhine -- Westphalia and northern Baden --
Wuerttemberg were affected, far higher than the 10 plants
affected by similar warning strikes Monday. The total number
of striking workers claimed by the union was 68,000, slightly
higher than Monday's 65,000.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6848 marks, up from 1.6808 marks late Tuesday, and at
157.95 yen, down from 158.83 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6425, down from $1.6445 late Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, the dollar fell almost one yen as market
participants began to reassess their bearish stance on the
yen in light of the improved performance of Japanese stock
prices. But participants said the Japanese unit also was
helped by the thinness of the market, in which a few large
yen buy orders caused exaggerated movement. The Japanese will
observe holidays Thursday and Friday as part of the "Golden
Week" of holidays in Japan.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.50 an ounce, down 50 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 2.2 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $369.90 an
ounce.
