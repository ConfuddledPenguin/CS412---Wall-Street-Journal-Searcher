   Johnson Matthey PLC, a major British precious metals and
metal-goods manufacturer, said it intends to undergo a major
cost-cutting program that will lead to "substantial" charges
against earnings for the year ended March 31.
   The move was triggered by a need to bring production and
overhead costs back into line after a period in which they
were growing faster than the group's overall gross profit
margin.

   David Davies, who was named chairman of the company in
January following a board room shake-up, said the measures
would include a reduction in the company's business units,
currently totaling 77; a more decentralized management, and
the rationalization of U.K. precious metal refining
operations.
   "Investment will increasingly be focused on those
businesses with potential for good long-term growth," Mr.
Davies said.
