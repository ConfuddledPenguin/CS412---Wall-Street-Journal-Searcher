   Money market mutual fund investors are starting to look
for higher yields elsewhere.
   Money fund assets fell $3.5 billion in the week ended
Tuesday, the largest drop in more than two years, excluding
end-of-year seasonal declines, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. Total assets of the 426 taxable funds
tracked by the Holliston, Mass., newsletter were $378.1
billion, the lowest in 12 weeks.

   The drop was entirely attributable to individual
investors; assets of funds open only to institutions rose
$948.3 million.
   "Money fund investors are pretty sophisticated," said
Brenda Malizia Negus, the newsletter's editor. "They're
locking in higher yields elsewhere . . . in CDs or
Treasurys."
   Yields on taxable money funds declined in the latest week,
while yields on certificates of deposit and Treasury
securities rose. The average seven-day compound yield of the
funds declined to 7.96% from 7.99%. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.
   Meanwhile, the yield on a six-month T-bill sold at
Monday's auction rose to 8.49% from 8.35% the week before.
Six-month CDs sold by major brokerage houses are currently
yielding an average of 8.37%, according to Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service.
   Yields are even better for longer-term investments.
Treasury notes and bonds, for instance, are yielding more
than 9% on maturities of two years and longer. Some big banks
are offering more than 9% on five-year CDs of more than
$90,000.
   Some of the withdrawals from money funds also went to pay
income taxes and some went into bond mutual funds, said
Walter Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's.
   Until the past few weeks, money fund assets had been
increasing steadily, sometimes more than $1 billion a week.
The most recent big drop was $3.6 billion at the end of 1989,
which was attributed to normal end-of-year withdrawals.
Assets fell $3.7 billion at the end of 1988. Yields have
fallen more than 1.5 percentage point since peaking April
1989, after months of steady increases.
   Average maturity of the funds investments -- such things
as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), bank CDs and
short-term Treasury securities -- remained at a relatively
long 44 days in the latest week. Longer maturities usually
are considered a sign that portfolio managers think rates are
falling because the longer maturities enable the managers to
retain comparatively high yields longer.
   The average maturity has been longer than 40 days for
several months. The range has been 29 to 53 days in recent
years.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
fell to 7.67% from 7.69%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.68% from 7.69%, while the average 30-day
compound yield went to 7.98% from 7.99%.
   Assets of tax-free money funds also fell, although yields
rose. Assets of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by
Donoghue's fell $1.2 billion, to $75.4 billion. The average
seven-day compound yield of the tax-free funds rose to 5.79%
from 5.74%. That's equal to 8.04% for an investor in the 28%
tax bracket and to 8.64% for someone paying 33%. Tax-free
yields have moved in response to the supply of tax-exempt
securities in recent months, said Mr. Frank of Donoghue's.
   The average maturity of the tax-free funds shortened to 41
days from 43 days.
