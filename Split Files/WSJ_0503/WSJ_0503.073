   Monsanto Co., in a broad reassignment of top managers,
plucked Robert B. Shapiro from its NutraSweet Co. unit to
head its big agricultural-products business.
   The move places Mr. Shapiro, who established a reputation
as a marketing whiz at NutraSweet, in the race for the
president's post at Monsanto when its current occupant, Earle
H. Harbison Jr., retires. Mr. Shapiro is 51 years old, and
Mr. Harbison is 61.

   "I thought this was a good opportunity to broaden the
background of Bob Shapiro," said Richard J. Mahoney,
Monsanto's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Mahoney, 56, also acknowledged that Mr. Shapiro is now
in the line of succession to the highest executive posts at
Monsanto, a diversified chemicals concern based in St. Louis.
But he added that there are other candidates and various
reasons for the management shuffle, which takes effect June
1.
   The other executive often named as in the running for the
president's post is Robert G. Potter, 51, the president of
Monsanto's core chemicals company. Under the new arrangement,
he and Mr. Shapiro both become corporate executive vice
presidents. Mr. Potter had been a corporate group vice
president.
   At the agricultural-chemicals business, Mr. Shapiro
succeeds Nicholas L. Reding, who will remain an executive
vice president but will have responsibility for programs in
environment, safety, health and manufacturing. Some
chemical-industry analysts observed that Mr. Reding's age,
55, may have weighed against him in succession issues if
Monsanto is planning who ultimately will take Mr. Mahoney's
place.
   Mr. Mahoney dismissed that speculation, noting that
Monsanto has recently taken strong stands on environmental
protection and that Mr. Reding, unlike his predecessor in the
top environmental job, will report directly to the chief
executive. "I wanted Reding on the environment, working very
closely with me," Mr. Mahoney said. "That's all there is to
say."
   As the new president of Monsanto Agricultural Co., Mr.
Shapiro will be running a business that last year earned $432
million pretax on sales of $1.72 billion. His jobs will
include protecting the company's big-selling Roundup
herbicide, which is beginning to go off patent in several
markets, and overseeing the market introduction of new crop
chemicals in the Monsanto pipeline.
   Mr. Shapiro, who of late has served on the advisory
committee of the agricultural company, will also have to
establish himself in the farm industry, where Mr. Reding has
strong ties. In recent years, "there has been a change for
the better at Monsanto as far as the customer is concerned,"
said Keith Boyer, president of Brayton Chemical Co., a
Burlington, Iowa, distributor of crop chemicals.
   A lawyer by training, Mr. Shapiro saw his star rise at the
NutraSweet unit, where he was chairman and chief executive.
He made a huge success of NutraSweet's aspartame sweetener,
managing to get food companies to pay a premium while
displaying the ingredient's logo on their own products. Last
year, NutraSweet had pretax profit of $180 million on sales
of $869 million, even after about a $170 million charge
related to patent values.
   "I'm glad to see Monsanto will reach anywhere for
management talent," said Leslie Ravitz, a chemical-industry
analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., arguing that Mr. Shapiro's
marketing savvy will serve him well in the competitive
crop-chemicals field. But at Anantha Raman &amp; Co., analyst Pat
O'Brien expressed surprise that Monsanto would pick someone
from a legal and consumer-products background to run a
farm-related business. "It's nothing short of phenomenal,"
she said.
   Succeeding Mr. Shapiro at NutraSweet will be Robert E.
Flynn, 56, currently chairman and chief executive of
Monsanto's Fisher Controls International Inc., a maker of
process-control valves and other equipment. That appointment
also raised some questions, since Mr. Flynn lacks
consumer-products experience outside his service on the
NutraSweet board.
   But Mr. Mahoney, the Monsanto chief executive, called Mr.
Flynn "a very well-rounded businessman" who will arrive at
NutraSweet during a period when it plans to rapidly expand
production capacity and shave costs. Mr. Flynn will also
oversee the protection of the aspartame franchise as it loses
patent protection in the U.S. in 1992 and early marketing of
NutraSweet's new Simplesse fat substitute.
   Larry W. Solley, 48, currently a group vice president at
Fisher, will succeed Mr. Flynn there.
   Harold J. Corbett, 62, a corporate senior vice president
in charge of environmental and other affairs, will retire in
1991. In the interim, he will assist Mr. Reding.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Monsanto closed at $101.125, up $1.375.
