   SLHD Inc., formerly Sporto Corp., again reduced the
estimated value of its final liquidating distribution to
shareholders because of environmental cleanup costs. It
reduced the estimated value of the distribution "by at least
10 cents a share" from the $1 to $1.25 a share previously
estimated. As reported, Slhd agreed to sell its Jasper, Ga.,
footwear manufacturing facility to Carter Footwear Co.,
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., subject to cleanup of contaminated soil.
Slhd said that the state of Georgia rejected its original
cleanup plan and it estimated that the revised plan, which
has been approved, will cost $340,000, rather than less than
$225,000 as previously announced. However, the state added
requirements for water monitoring. Slhd said that it doesn't
think ground water has been contaminated, but "if
contamination is present, the cost for remediation could
significantly increase."
