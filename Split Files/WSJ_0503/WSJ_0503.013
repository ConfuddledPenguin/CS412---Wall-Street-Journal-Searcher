   When Avis Service Inc. entered the quick-lube franchise
business three years ago, it hoped its parent company's big
name in rental cars would help produce big profits in a
booming field.
   But since then, nearly every problem in the franchise book
has dogged the company: Its market is creeping toward
saturation, competition is fierce and the Avis Inc. unit,
which had no experience in the quick-lube field, is having
trouble finding sites for its Avis Lube stations.

   Avis Service, Garden City, N.Y., lags far behind its goal
to sell 200 outlets its first year; three years later, only
67 quick-lube stations are open today. And now, the company
that built a name "trying harder" is up against a
franchiser's nightmare: a full-fledged revolt of franchisees
throughout the Northeast and Florida.
   So bitter are franchisees that many are demanding refunds.
Some are filing lawsuits, alleging fraud and
misrepresentation in the sale of franchises. And one lawsuit,
which has hounded Avis Service since its first days in
business, charges that the company tricked and destroyed a
small competitor to enter the market itself.
   "Avis has been my first enemy from day one," says Gary
Dolderer, who put up $50,000 to start five Avis Lube
franchises in Connecticut. Nearly three years after quitting
as a vice president for a transportation management firm to
get into the business, he is still waiting to break ground on
his first franchise, set for July.
   Bill Clifford, who has yet to see the first of three sites
in Brevard County, Fla., after waiting nearly two years,
says, "I put up $30,000 and they don't have the courtesy to
return my call." Echoing frustrations of many franchisees, he
says Avis Service promised to help him find sites and then
repeatedly said the locations he proposed were too expensive
or unsuitable.
   Avis Service denies wrongdoing and insists franchisees --
including Messrs. Dolderer and Clifford -- who ultimately are
responsible for finding and developing sites, expected too
much help in doing that.
   Less than four years ago, nobody imagined the problems
that would hound Avis Service. In September 1986, Avis
Service and Witco Corp.'s Kendall refining division in
Bradford, Pa., agreed to form K&amp;A Partnership to develop a
nationwide chain of Avis Lube centers. (Avis bought out
Kendall in 1989 and is sole owner.)
   The partnership was controversial from day one. A suit in
U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., by Lightning Lube Inc.,
a Berlin, N.J., operator of Laser Lube outlets, charges that
during meetings in the first half of 1986, Kendall obtained
valuable marketing information from Laser Lube regarding its
franchise operation. The suit alleges Kendall didn't disclose
plans to enter the market as a competitor. The meeting
ostensibly was held to negotiate the sale of Kendall oil and
oil-dispensing gear to Lightning Lube, the suit says.
   Later, Kendall tried to buy Lightning Lube, but it refused
to sell. Fearful that Laser Lube would cause competitive
problems, K&amp;A engaged in a scheme to drive Lightning Lube out
of business, the suit charges. The suit alleges Kendall
charged Laser Lube for oil at inflated prices and later
offered discount prices and free lube equipment to Laser Lube
franchisees if they would go independent.
   Also, the suit charges that Kendall denigrated Lightning
Lube President Ralph Venuto, telling franchisees Mr. Venuto
was cheating them, partly by charging for equipment he got
free from Kendall. Mr. Venuto says he fielded several angry
calls from franchisees in late 1986, asking for their money
back. (Some later filed suits, still pending, seeking their
money back.)
   Avis Service declined to comment on the suit except to say
it believes the suit will be dismissed. (Witco, also named as
a defendant by Lightning Lube, also declined to comment.)
   After calling Mr. Venuto, some Lightning Lube franchisees
took down signs, refused to pay royalties and discouraged
prospective investors, Mr. Venuto says. "It was kind of like
a rock slide," says Steven Kramer, Mr. Venuto's lawyer. "They
thought Ralph was ripping them off."
   Largely because of the franchisee rebellion, Lightning
Lube says, it ceased operating in mid-1988; Shamrock Energies
Corp. acquired the rights to serve as franchiser for 30 Laser
Lube outlets. With the proceeds from the sale of these
rights, Mr. Venuto says he will return money to roughly 50
people who had put up $19,500 in deposits for territories.
   While Lightning Lube faded, Avis Service was rapidly
signing up prospective franchisees. But "all of a sudden they
found themselves in a situation where they were taking in a
lot of money and couldn't find acceptable sites," says
Patrick J. Boroian, president of Francorp, an Olympia Fields,
Ill., franchise consulting firm.
   In many areas, convenience stores and fast-food chains had
gobbled up spots with easy access and high-traffic volumes.
More often, former gas station sites, common locations for
quick-lube stations, had come under stricter regulation
because of concerns with toxic contamination.
   Many investors complain Avis Service's real estate staff,
charged with assisting franchisers in finding and developing
sites, didn't do its job. Fred Curtain, a former selector of
service-station sites for Shell Oil Co. and now a Fairfield,
Conn., real-estate broker, says he looked at 20 prospective
Avis Lube sites last year for Avis representatives and a
franchisee. "They were totally inept," he says, adding that
he now refuses to deal with Avis.
   "There's no doubt I've broken a couple of hearts when I've
turned down real estate sites," says Vincent Russo, general
manager and a vice president at Avis Service. But "there are
a variety of reasons. . . ." He acknowledges sites have been
difficult to find and says some franchisees who counted on a
single site were given refunds when none materialized. He
says Avis Service still plans to expand. The company declines
to disclose financial results of the operation so far.
   Mr. Russo notes the firm entered the industry with
look-alike outlets when established chains were already
suffering effects of market saturation. The U.S. today has
about 3,500 to 4,000 quick-lube outlets, more than double
that of five years ago.
   Rivals and others say Avis failed to realize the amount of
capital and attention needed to nurture a franchise system.
Says John Gallivan, executive vice president of Grease Monkey
International Inc., a Denver chain, "I think they had a rude
awakening. It's a long and tedious process to build a
successful chain of fast-lubes."
