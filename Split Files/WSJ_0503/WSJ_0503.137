   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Riding a jet ski was fine. Taking a ride
in an ultra-light plane was a bit racy, but why not? Riding a
motorcycle at twice the authorized speed limit without a
helmet was somewhat reckless, but everybody does that here.
But when it appeared he wanted to parachute too, that seemed
a bit much.
   "It would be safer for the country if you were to take on
Mike Tyson," Health Minister Alceni Guerra suggested
politely.

   The stuntman here is none other than Brazilian President
Fernando Collor de Mello, whom President George Bush recently
referred to as Indiana Jones, but really acts more like the
elegant daredevil James Bond. Ever since Mr. Collor took
office on March 15, he has looked adventure -- or danger --
in the face every Sunday, a practice that provides great
photo opportunities and lots of press coverage on otherwise
slow news days.
   Not that he's dull during the week. His first major move
as president was to implement a sweeping anti-inflation plan
that he bullied through the Congress. He also decided, a few
days after taking office, to have a look for himself at the
sad plight of the Yanomami Indians, whose livelihood is
threatened by diseases and ecological destruction left behind
by 45,000 gold prospectors who invaded their lands.
   So Brazil's first democratically elected president in 29
years donned a military camouflage outfit, dressed up his
25-year-old wife and two children from a previous marriage in
similar fatigues, boarded an Air Force jet and flew to the
Amazon. After visiting an Indian village and cruising over
the area where prospectors have carved out airstrips, Mr.
Collor turned to the Federal police chief who was
accompanying him, and said: "Dynamite the airstrips. And make
it snappy."
   Brazilians are watching this stylish muscle-flexing with a
mixture of awe, amusement -- and fear that all the glitz
belies a populist, authoritarian streak, not to mention a
dose of irresponsibility, immaturity and megalomania.
   "Collor is a high-tech strongman who has used Third World
tactics to try to make Brazil a First World country," says
prominent Sao Paulo businessman Ricardo Semler. "Collor
should limit his exploits to fixing the economy," says Luiza
Gomes Montes, a Rio cleaning lady.
   To many, the 40-year-old Mr. Collor, whom People magazine
just named one of the world's 50 most beautiful people, has
brought a touch of Kennedy-esque glamour to the largely
discredited Brazilian presidency; former President Jose
Sarney had elevated inertia to an art form.
   "We have a president who is young, good-looking, sporty,
courageous and competent. Everything he does succeeds," says
Mr. Collor's spokesman, Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva, with
characteristic modesty. Though Mr. Rosa e Silva denies there
is any marketing strategy behind the making of this
president, the media attention has given Mr. Collor the image
of a new kind of politician: youthful, dynamic, quick to
decide.
   Some fear he is too quick. He has already had to remove
two bills he sent to the Congress because they were
apparently unconstitutional. He had to reinstate another bill
he had personally vetoed when it was pointed out that his
party had received prior government approval for the bill.
Some wonder whether Mr. Collor doesn't act before thinking
and isn't doing just a little too much -- both on and off the
playing field.
   Mr. Collor's mother couldn't agree more, at least
regarding his physical exploits. "I'm as worried about this
as all of you are," 74-year-old Leda Collor de Mello told a
women's group last week as she launched a national campaign
to knock some sense into young Fernando's head. "I'm making
an appeal that you address yourselves to him, in letters and
telegrams, asking him that he stop these games." To further
drive in the message, Mrs. Collor this weekend published a
guest column in Veja, a newsweekly, entitled "We're Worried."
She wrote: "Riding a motorcycle is something all my sons did,
and I never approved of it. But this didn't worry me half as
much as Fernando's flight in a supersonic jet."
   Mr. Collor's mother was referring to the way her son the
president chose to celebrate Earth Day -- in the sky,
breaking the speed of sound in a two-man Mirage fighter jet.
That was a respite from his previous day's busy schedule: He
played both volleyball and soccer. Naturally, he scored a
goal. Mr. Collor is also a karate black-belt and has run nine
kilometers in a respectable hour and twenty minutes.
   For one coming attraction, Mr. Collor has scheduled a
submarine excursion. Political columnist Gilberto Dimenstein
thinks this shows bad timing, saying the president should
have saved this stunt for when "his public appeal isn't so
high and he needs to submerge."
   Mr. Collor also plans to train next week with the
Brazilian national soccer team, which is preparing for the
World Cup. (He wasn't chosen among the 22 players who will
fly to Italy in June, however, although his spokesman says he
is a "reasonably competent" defender.) The soccer could also
be a mistake, says political scientist Amaury de Souza.
"He'll either make a fool of himself or of the whole team,"
he says. "If they play hard, he can't keep up with them, and
if they don't, they'll say it was to preserve this clown."
   Just in case Mr. Collor runs out of ideas for acts of
derring-do, humorist Jo Soares helpfully published a list of
potential Sunday outings. He expresses regret at Mr. Collor's
apparent about-face on parachuting, which will deprive people
of exclaiming: "Look, up in the sky] It's a bird] It's a
plane] It's super-Collor]" But he offered some other
tantalizing possibilities: riding down the Igacu waterfalls
in a barrel; walking a tightrope to the Sugar Loaf Mountain
in Rio; or jumping on a motorcycle, Evel Knievel-style, over
all the cars Mr. Collor has confiscated from public servants
as part of his morality-in-government drive.
   Mr. Collor recently issued an official statement about
these tendencies, saying that "the President of the Republic,
as a good son, will attend to his mother's request and will
no longer ride a motorcycle" -- so much for Mr. Soares's last
suggestion. But filial duty comes hard to this president.
"I'm criticized for riding a motorcycle or an ultra-light
plane, as if this were forbidden," he told journalists
recently. "I'm a man of my times. I like motorcycles and
jet-skis."
   But many Brazilians criticize Mr. Collor for more serious
reasons -- like his economic plan, in which he has frozen
about 70% of the money circulating in the Brazilian economy
for 18 months to cure Brazil of its runaway inflation. Mr.
Collor himself says the plan burns all bridges and the choice
is "Win or win." But, some wonder, what happens to Brazil if
it fails, since Mr. Collor says there's no return.
   Mr. Collor himself sees no problem with the plan. Last
Tuesday, he went to check things out for himself, paying a
surprise -- but highly publicized -- visit to a Brasilia
supermarket. Pushing his shopping cart through the aisles,
Mr. Collor picked out 19 items that constitute the basic
grocery basket, all the while carefully comparing the prices
to the official table issued so the government-imposed price
freeze can be enforced.
   After paying with a check for 1,430.97 Cruzeiros (about
$30), Mr. Collor noted with satisfaction that the 19 items he
had picked out were 11.5% cheaper than before the plan. That
satisfaction was offset by the potato problem, however. Mr.
Collor didn't like the look of them, so he told the
supermarket manager: "This can't be. Remove all the potatoes
immediately. There is no way you can offer these potatoes to
the public." Turning to his security guard, Col. Dark Nunes
de Figueiredo, Mr. Collor said: "Colonel, send the Public
Health authorities here immediately to record this."
   Mostly, Mr. Collor's showmanship is popular among
Brazilians, though everyone agrees that the success of his
economic program will prove more satisfying than the stylish
figure he cuts on jet skis. Meanwhile, the letters, telegrams
and faxes requested by Mr. Collor's mother pour in to the
Palacio do Planalto.
   "The letters basically say, `For God's sake, don't expose
yourself to danger, we need you,'" notes Fatima Medreiros,
who works in Mr. Collor's office. Others are more critical,
saying that the high-born Mr. Collor, who claimed during the
campaign to be a man of the people, practices elite sports.
The British School urges Mr. Collor to grow up. Others write
that if Mr. Collor really wants adventure, he should go wait
on line at a bank or at a gas station, like they do all day.
