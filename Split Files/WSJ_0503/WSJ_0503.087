   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Corvus Systems Inc., which sought
federal bankruptcy court protection nearly two years ago,
said it filed a proposed plan of reorganization.
   Under the terms of the plan, filed in federal bankruptcy
court in San Jose, the company's unsecured creditors would
receive an immediate cash payment equal to 10% of their
allowed claims from Corvus's current cash. They would get
another cash payment equal to 10% of their allowed claims
within 12 months.

   Corvus also said the plan provides that unsecured
creditors may receive one share of Corvus stock for every $10
of their claims, or they may participate in a creditors'
fund. Under the fund, they might receive further cash
payments on their claims from the sale of certain Corvus
assets, which the company declined to identify. Corvus
shareholders will retain their stock, subject to a one-for-10
reverse split, the company added.
   Corvus, which makes equipment that allows computers to
communicate with one another, said at the time of its filing
in June 1988 that its cash position wouldn't allow it to
"move forward" without Chapter 11 protection. Under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the company is protected from
creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
At the time of its filing, Corvus listed total assets of
$11.5 million and total liabilities of $9.6 million, of which
$3.6 million were secured.
   Under the plan, Corvus said its largest shareholder, Berg
&amp; Berg Industrial Developers, which controls 1.45 million
shares, or 8% of Corvus's common stock outstanding, is owed
$3.2 million and as a secured creditor would be paid in full
over a sevenyear period. The firm added in the plan that it
intends to file a lawsuit to ask the bankruptcy court to
determine the extent and value of Berg &amp; Berg's interest.
