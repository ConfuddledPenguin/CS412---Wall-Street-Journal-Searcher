   BEREA, Ohio -- Central Reserve Life Corp. said it will
report lower earnings for the first quarter ended March 31.
For the year-ago quarter, the insurance company reported
earnings of $558,000, or 13 cents a share.
   The company said the lower earnings are from higher costs
associated with the increase in premiums. Results will be
available next week.
