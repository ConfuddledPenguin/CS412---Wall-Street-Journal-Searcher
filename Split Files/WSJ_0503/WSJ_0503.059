   The world's largest game of chicken ended this week, as
both Japan and the U.S. drove off the road before they rammed
each other in a trade collision. Unfortunately, Congress has
decreed that the same game be played every year, and one of
these times we may not be so lucky.
   A big trade crackup is just what many in Congress have in
mind. After George Bush decided to lift Japan and Brazil from
the "Super 301" trade-offender list, the Members sped to ram
Japan even though it'd made multiple trade concessions the
past 15 months. "It's time we quit playing patsy with these
guys," declared Rep. Frank Horton, a heretofore obscure
Republican from New York. Richard Gephardt, the House
Majority Leader, said Congress may pass legislation to force
Mr. Bush to cite Japan again, because "at the very moment you
ought to be hitting the gas, we're hitting the brake."

   George Bush ignored these reckless drivers. He knows that
after Japan's Prime Minister Kaifu made public concessions on
last year's 301 list -- on wood products, supercomputers and
satellites -- another U.S. slap could well have toppled him.
Mr. Bush also knows that the same Americans who hail the
smallest concession by Moscow, an historic adversary,
denounce any agreement with Japan, a friend and ally. These
people will never be satisfied.
   Yet even the Bush Administration seems enamored of the 301
"tool," as trade rep Carla Hills calls it. The idea is that
somehow the trade "pressure" of 301 is responsible for
Japanese concessions. This is impossible to disprove, but
Japan's own domestic politics probably have much more to do
with it. Japanese consumers are awakening to their relatively
poor standard of living, enough so that even Japan's
Socialist Party exploited the consumer issue in last year's
elections. Mr. Kaifu's Liberal Democrats have scrambled to
catch up.
   U.S. diplomacy may be a useful echo, but the ultimatum
that 301 represents -- give in or we retaliate -- is
counterproductive. It feeds the resentment of mirror-image
mercantilists in both countries -- for example, "The Japan
That Can Say No" crowd. It makes compromises more difficult.
Worst of all, if both sides fail to back down and the U.S.
retaliates, everyone loses. Japan's markets won't be open to
any greater degree, and American consumers will pay higher
prices on whatever goods the U.S. decides to punish in
return. What price, trade machismo? Sensibly, the Bush
Administration hopes to make further progress in the Uruguay
round of world trade talks set to conclude later this year.
   As we've said before, the 301 game of chicken is a
political reaction to a non-problem, the trade deficit. Mr.
Gephardt this week asserted that "the $49 billion trade
deficit this year with Japan represents one million lost
American jobs." The U.S. economy will create tens of
thousands of new jobs this year and has created some 20
million over the years that the deficit was even larger. U.S.
exports to Japan doubled in four years to $44 billion in
1989. Who's your economist, Dick?
   The world economy desperately needs American leadership,
but the 301 game makes us no better than the other
mercantilists pandering to domestic producers. It's a global
crackup waiting to happen.
