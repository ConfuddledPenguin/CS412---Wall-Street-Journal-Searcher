   Pic `N' Save Corp., the target of a potential takeover,
said it doubted that financing could be obtained for any
acquisition or leveraged buy-out bid "that would be
attractive to our shareholders."
   That opinion was part of a statement issued yesterday that
was Pic `N' Save's first public response to Girard Partners
Limited Partnership's threatened proxy fight at the company's
annual meeting on June 20. The partnership, controlled by
David H. Batchelder, also has said it is preparing a bid to
acquire Pic `N' Save, which is based in Dominguez, Calif.

   Lewis B. Merrifield III, Pic `N' Save's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in the statement that the board and
"management have been and remain committed to maximizing
shareholder value. . . . We have developed an operating plan
which we believe will achieve this end."
   In the company's 1989 annual report that was being
prepared for mailing to shareholders late yesterday, Pic `N'
Save said it plans to "moderate new store growth
significantly so that we can . . . concentrate all of our
energies on improving profitability." As recently as March,
Mr. Merrifield had affirmed the company's aggressive
expansion strategy. Last year, Pic `N' Save opened 35 stores,
bringing the total to 190 by year end.
   The annual report also noted that the board recently
authorized the buy-back of as much as five million, or 14%,
of the company's roughly 35.5 million shares outstanding. In
addition, Pic `N' Save said, "We are actively evaluating
aggressive alternatives which we believe could provide even
more near-term value for our stockholders." The alternatives
weren't spelled out, and company officials declined to
elaborate.
   Mr. Batchelder, a former strategist for T. Boone Pickens,
didn't return calls to his office in La Jolla, Calif.
   Analysts were disappointed that Pic `N' Save didn't offer
a stronger response to Girard Partners.
   Management's response "doesn't address anything specific,"
complained Sarah Stack, a retail analyst at Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles. "Institutional investors
are disappointed by the stock's poor performance in recent
years and are receptive to {acquisition} offers," she added.
   Ms. Stack said Pic `N' Save's business has been hurt as
the gap between the company's markdowns on retail close-out
merchandise has shrunk compared with other retailers'
discounts. She speculated that "the viability of Pic `N'
Save's retail concept may be waning" because the availability
of close-out merchandise is "serendipitous."
   In national over-the-counter trading, Pic `N' Save shares
closed yesterday at $13, down 50 cents, on volume of 524,100
shares.
   Pic `N' Save was founded more than four decades ago in
Southern California. It went public in 1971 and in recent
years has expanded into New York, New Jersey, Texas and other
states. In March, the company reported "disappointing" 1989
results. Net income fell 34% to $30.9 million, or 87 cents a
share, on sales of $475.2 million.
