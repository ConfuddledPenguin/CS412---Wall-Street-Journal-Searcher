   NEW YORK -- At Salomon Inc.'s annual meeting yesterday, it
was business as usual until somebody mentioned That Book.
   In an unusual diversion from Wall Street solemnity,
Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund treated shareholders to his
first comments on the book "Liar's Poker," a bestseller about
bond trading at the firm.

   "We have been a laughingstock" because of the book, he
said. The book apparently caused tensions with some clients.
But "we have overcome that by doing our job well."
   The bestselling book chronicles the bawdy antics of some
Salomon traders, including one known as the "Human Piranha."
Written by a former Salomon bond salesman, Michael Lewis, it
paints an unflattering picture of Salomon sticking certain
clients with bad bonds on occasion, among other things.
   At the meeting, Mr. Gutfreund said he never met the author
Mr. Lewis, and said the book bears "no relation to reality."
The book "systematically attempted to say we ravaged our
customers. It didn't make much sense," he said. "We may have
been stupid, but we have been honorable in dealing with our
customers."
   When "Liar's Poker" came out last autumn, Salomon
officials discussed the book at a morning meeting, telling
employees to read it so they'd be able to defend themselves,
industry executives said. Since then, the firm hasn't said
much publicly about the matter.
   But "Liar's Poker" wasn't the only piece of literature on
Salomon's agenda at yesterday's 1 1/4-hour meeting. Mr.
Gutfreund called "Barbarians at the Gate" -- the book about
the mammoth RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover -- a "pretty good
book."
   One passage in Barbarians has Salomon pulling out of the
deal because its name wouldn't be on the preferred side of a
planned advertisement. That passage was "a gross
oversimplification," Mr. Gutfreund said. "We had major
reservations about other aspects of the deal."
