   Notaries public, the little-noticed functionaries who
attest to the authenticity of signatures on business
documents, are causing big worries.
   A study of notaries in New York shows that the vast
majority are performing their official duties improperly.
Experts say the study highlights a growing national problem.
"You could get substantially similar results in any other
state," says Eugene E. Hines, executive director of the
American Society of Notaries, a Washington trade group.

   Bills to reform guidelines for notaries are pending in
California, Florida and New York. Nearly every other state is
considering reform measures, according to Carole Irwin-Leal,
public records manager in the Oregon secretary of state's
office. A notary reform law is going into effect in Oregon
this July.
   There are about four million notaries in the U.S. Almost
anyone who is over the age of 18 and pays the required fees
is eligible. Typically appointed by the secretary of state or
the governor, notaries are state officers who are supposed to
play a critical role in protecting the public from fraud and
phony documents. Their primary duty is to verify the identity
of the signers of business documents such as deeds, wills,
mortgages and contracts. They also administer oaths, take
affidavits and depositions, and attest to the authenticity of
signatures.
   But procedural errors made by notaries could result in
countless challenges to legal and business documents or their
possible invalidation, says Alfred E. Piombino, president of
the New York State Association of Notaries Public, the
Albany, N.Y., trade group that conducted the survey.
   "I've seen people lose their homes and their life savings
because a notary was careless and didn't check a person's
proper identification," says James Randall, chief of the
notary public division in the California secretary of state's
office.
   In the New York study, the first of its kind in the
nation, a simple affidavit was presented for "notarization"
to 217 randomly selected notaries in New York state.
   The study showed that only one of the 217 notaries
properly completed the procedure; 97.7% were unfamiliar with
the authentification procedure that verifies certificates
issued by notaries; 88.5% neglected to administer the
required oath to the affiant, the person seeking
notarization; and 82.5% failed to check the affiant's
identification.
   "We have a class of public officers who act chiefly
unsupervised and execute acts of law. The results {of the
study} are a mockery to the whole system," says Mr. Piombino.
   William F. Brown, a spokesman for the New York secretary
of state's office, says his office is examining the study but
that he is concerned about its accuracy because only a small
percentage of the state's 251,000 notaries were surveyed.
"While there may be a number of administerial errors, we
haven't seen anything that puts the consumers at risk," he
says.
   Nevertheless, New York Assemblymen G. Oliver Koppell and
Gary Proud have incorporated some of the studies' findings
into a bill to raise the fees notaries can charge the public.
The bill is pending in the Legislature. "People aren't taking
the job as seriously as they should. We want it to be seen as
professional," says Maureen Danaher, staff attorney for Mr.
Koppell. In New York City, notaries can charge up to $1;
elsewhere in the state they can charge 25 cents. The bill
would raise the charge to $2 throughout the state.
   Only five states -- New York, California, Connecticut,
Louisiana and Texas -- require applicants to take a written
examination. But some public officials question whether the
tests are stringent enough. In California, applicants take a
15-item "true or false" open book exam that they have been
given in advance to study, says Mr. Randall.
   "We're in the process of trying to develop a more
comprehensive, proctored exam that will test their knowledge
better," Mr. Randall says. "Right now, it's not the most
difficult test." Still, 20% fail the exam, he says.
   Concerns about notarial abuse in Florida led Gov. Bob
Martinez to form a study commission on notaries, which
resulted in a bill pending in the state's Legislature. The
measure would require applicants to pass a written
examination, among other things. "We want to make the
notarial process mean something -- or do away with it
altogether," says Ken Rouse, general counsel for the Florida
Department of State. "There were large numbers of
transactions done with notarized documents, but it didn't
mean anything anymore."
   That attitude is precisely what concerns the National
Notary Association about the New York study. "The problems
described in the study happen, but not on the scale
indicated. Every once in a while a legislator suggests doing
away with notaries and could point to a study like this as
evidence to do so," says Charles N. Farber, vice president of
the Canoga Park, Calif., trade group, which sponsors
educational seminars for notaries.
   Still, there is widespread agreement that notaries often
don't fully understand their duties. Most questions involve
real estate transactions, where signatures are forged or
property is improperly transferred. Problems sometimes arise
when notaries fail to follow procedures at the request of a
friend, employer or relative.
   Sometimes notaries themselves are involved in fraud. "We
had a case in L.A., where a notary forged deeds of trust
against people's houses and got away with $1.8 million," says
Mr. Randall, the California notary official. "They caught
him, but he left 21 homeowners with a clouded title on their
property and big legal fees."
   Notaries may be suspended or removed for misconduct. They
also can be the target of civil or criminal suits. Only
rarely do they end up in jail. Most states require that
notaries post bonds of up to $10,000 to compensate citizens
who are injured by misconduct, "but that doesn't go very far
when you've lost a house worth $100,000," Mr. Randall says.
   Most experts point to an educational program adopted in
North Carolina in 1983 as a possible model for other states.
North Carolina requires prospective notaries to successfully
complete a three-hour to six-hour course offered through the
state's community colleges.
   "The nature of the complaints we had received involved
simple mistakes made because of the notaries' lack of
knowledge," says Ludelle Hatley, notary public director of
the North Carolina secretary of state's office.
   The need for some sort of official guidance has even
prompted some notaries to seek out seminars and courses on
their own. "We're just crying out for education," says James
W. Paulus, a notary in Baltimore who regularly attends
educational seminars. "I took some papers for notarization,
and the woman didn't even know what to do. She was so
relieved to find out I was a notary."

   FERRARI WINS trademark suit against a Tennessee kit-car
manufacturer.
   The U.S. District Court in Tennessee permanently enjoined
a manufacturer of kit cars from selling replicas of the
Daytona Spyder and Testarossa cars, both made by Ferrari
S.p.A.
   Ferrari sued kit-car maker Carl Roberts, of Greeneville,
Tenn., when he began advertising replicas of the two cars.
U.S. District Judge Thomas G. Hull said Mr. Roberts can no
longer sell the reproductions because they infringe on
Ferrari's trademark rights on the designs and appearances of
the cars. The judge ruled yesterday that by designing his
cars to look like Ferrari's, Mr. Roberts intended to
misappropriate the image and reputation of Ferrari. The
replicas were called the "Miami Spyder" and the "Miami
Coupe." A lawyer for Mr. Roberts declined to comment.
   Kit cars are do-it-yourself cars usually made up of parts
from a variety of models. Mr. Roberts' Ferrari look-alikes
consisted of molded fiberglass bodies mounted on Chevrolet
Corvette and Pontiac Fiero chassis.
   The decision was the second by a federal court upholding
Ferrari's trademark rights and prohibiting the manufacture
and sale of Ferrari replicas, said Jonathan I. Blackman of
Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, an attorney for the
company.
   Last year, the U.S. District Court in San Diego made a
similar ruling against a California seller of Daytona Spyder
lookalikes.

   LAWYER OVERSEEING effort to settle asbestos cases is asked
to step down.
   In a motion made last week, Owens-Illinois Inc., a former
asbestos manufacturer, charged that the attorney, Kenneth R.
Feinberg, has a conflict of interest because of his previous
work for manufacturers of asbestos, which causes respiratory
ailments. In an innovative federal-state arrangement in
January, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein and State
Supreme Court Judge Helen Freedman jointly appointed Mr.
Feinberg to oversee efforts to settle hundreds of asbestos
cases filed by former Brooklyn Navy Yard workers.
   Owens-Illinois said the prior work by Mr. Feinberg and his
firm, Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler of New York,
"provided him with confidential information going to the very
heart of the litigation he is now entrusted to mediate." From
1980 to 1983, Mr. Feinberg represented the Asbestos
Compensation Coalition, a group of asbestos companies
involved in litigation across the nation. Mr. Feinberg's work
included lobbying Congress and drafting legislative proposals
on how to compensate victims of asbestos, Owens-Illinois
said.
   In the court documents, written in part by Geoffrey
Hazard, an ethics professor at Yale Law School,
Owens-Illinois claims that the code of judicial conduct bars
Mr. Feinberg from overseeing the settlement efforts. The
company made a similar motion to prevent Mr. Feinberg from
serving as mediator in asbestos settlement efforts in
Maryland, but a lower court judge and state appellate court
rejected the motion.
   Mr. Feinberg's appointment ends May 31, unless it is
extended by the court. "I'm quite optimistic that by the end
of the month a settlement will be reached in these cases, and
no extension of my mandate will be necessary," Mr. Feinberg
said. A hearing on the Owens-Illinois motion is set for May
15 in state court in Manhattan, before Judge Weinstein and
Judge Freedman.
   "Owens-Illinois could not be more cooperative in this
process," Mr. Feinberg said. "They have acted in absolutely
the most good faith. They haven't given me any indication
that they are anything but eager to see this mediation effort
succeed."

   CONFIDENTIAL MEETINGS by state agency officials
discouraged in Texas.
   The court's decision endorsed a 1973 Texas law that is
similar to the so-called sunshine statutes passed by most
states in the 1960s and 1970s. Such laws require government
agencies to conduct their business in public, but they have
spawned numerous disputes over whether agency officials may
informally discuss contested cases among themselves in
private.
   The vital question is whether administrative
decision-making should be done openly or secretly, the Texas
court said in an opinion by Judge Lloyd Doggett. "We believe
the law requires openess."
   At issue was a 1986 Texas Water Commission decision
denying Charles M. Acker's request for a permit for a
wastewater treatment plant to service his mobile-home park.
Mr. Acker had challenged the decision on grounds that two
commission members violated the open meetings law by
discussing the case in a restroom during a hearing recess. A
trial court upheld his claim.
   But in a controversial decision last May, a state appeals
court said the Texas open meetings law was superseded by a
1975 statute governing administrative procedures in Texas. A
provision of that law specifically permits private talks
among state agency members in contested cases. And Texas
attorneys argued before the state supreme court that
regulators would be hamstrung unless they could discuss
pending cases in private.
   The Texas Supreme Court disagreed, saying the appeals
court ruling would permit "serious circumvention" of open
government. "In administrative review of contested issues
from A to Z -- from alcoholic beverages to zoos, secrecy
would suddenly be authorized," the court ruled in overturning
the appeals court decision.
