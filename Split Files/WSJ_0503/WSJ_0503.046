   In regard to the April 4 editorial-page article "Was a
Mall to Blame for a Mass Murder?" by Prof. Lawrence W.
Sherman: As the lead attorney for the plaintiffs who won the
case against the owners and management of the Springfield
Mall, in the Philadelphia suburbs, I view Prof. Sherman's
article as a sour-grapes attempt to win from a sympathetic
"jury" of business people the case his team lost in the
Delaware County Courthouse in February.
   He says the jury ruled that Sylvia Seegrist's "crime was
the fault of the shopping mall." In fact, the jury found that
the mall and its security staff were "negligent" in failing
to take reasonable precautions that would have prevented the
Seegrist rampage. As a professor, he should know the
difference between the two.

   Semantics aside, judge for yourself the facts of what
occurred at the Springfield Mall prior to and on Oct. 30,
1985, the day Sylvia Seegrist shot and killed three people
and seriously wounded seven others.
   As Prof. Sherman notes, Ms. Seegrist had been a nuisance
at the mall over a period of time. But after the mass murder
of 21 people at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro,
Calif., in 1984, her behavior turned belligerent, she made
deaths threats on several occasions, donned battle fatigues
and combat boots, and acted "bizarrely." He also noted that
she had been committed to mental hospitals 12 times and that
during one such commitment she stabbed a hospital employee.
   What he didn't mention was that:
   -- Just two weeks before the shootings, Ms. Seegrist was
in the McDonald's at the Springfield Mall threatening to kill
people.
   -- No one on the mall's security staff ever bothered to
find out Ms. Seegrist's mental state or her police record.
   -- No one on the mall's security staff ever called the
local police to notify them of the threats Ms. Seegrist had
made. If they had, she probably would have been banned from
the mall and possibly recommitted. The local police knew she
was dangerous and the chief of police testified to that
effect at the trial.
   -- There was no notification from one security shift to
another of Ms. Seegrist's activities so that some security
people had no idea who she was or what she did. No photo had
ever been taken of her by security to identify her as a
problem person, something routinely done with anyone who
shoplifts a few dollars' worth of merchandise.
   -- There was virtually no training for the security staff,
whose main focus was on protecting the premises and property
of the mall tenants, not the customers' safety.
   -- One of the mall security staff saw Ms. Seegrist,
dressed in battle gear, take a rifle from the back of her car
in the parking lot that fateful day, but took no action
because it was the day before Halloween and he thought it was
a prank.
   -- Security never called Ms. Seegrist's mother and told
her of her daughter's behavior. If it had, she would have
taken steps to keep Ms. Seegrist out of the mall because she
knew she was dangerous. She had been struck by her daughter
on more than one occasion.
   -- One forensic psychiatrist testified at the trial that
Ms. Seegrist picked the Springfield Mall not by coincidence,
but because she felt "comfortable" there. Why? Because she
tested the limits of what the mall would let her get away
with and found there were no serious limits on her outrageous
behavior.
   In his article, Prof. Sherman said "foreseeability" was a
"crucial legal question" in this case. He reasoned that if
the mall's security staff could not foresee what happened
that day, the mall should not be held negligent and liable.
To prove his point, he cited statistics that the odds on what
happened in the Springfield Mall were "1 in 156 million" and
the "prior rate of such crimes by women nationwide was zero."
   Now it's all well and good to cite probability in a
courtroom, but can you imagine a $3.75-an-hour security guard
stopping and computing the odds on mass murder when he
encounters a person making terroristic threats? Of course
not. But one can reasonably expect a security guard
confronted by someone in battle gear holding a rifle to stop
that person, and say, "Pardon me, but guns are not allowed in
the mall." And then to call the appropriate authorities.
   The reality is that an underpaid, poorly trained security
staff at the Springfield Mall did not take "reasonable care"
as is specified by Pennsylvania law for public places, i.e.
to exercise reasonable care to discover that intentionally
harmful acts of third persons are being done or are likely to
be done and to give warning to enable visitors to avoid the
harm or to protect them against it.
   Is it any wonder the jury took less than three hours to
find the Springfield Mall and its management guilty of
negligence?
