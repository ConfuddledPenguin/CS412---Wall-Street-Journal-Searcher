   The exhilarating political transformation in Eastern
Europe has removed a major threat to democracy. But threats
outside Eastern Europe to countries which have been in the
"trenches of democracy" for generations remain.
   Some of those countries, like Jamaica today, stand at the
threshold of economic growth. In the past, many leaders,
myself included, placed too much reliance on government
involvement in the production of goods and services. Now we
are part of a general agreement that private sectors
operating in market conditions provide the best means to
economic growth and development. We have developed strong
private sectors, have for years attempted to implement
International Monetary Fund stabilization programs and World
Bank structural adjustment programs -- but find our economies
burdened by debt.

   At the same time, the intractable rules of lending
agencies frustrate rather than stimulate economic growth.
Without that growth, the social progress that is both the
implied promise of the democratic system and the expectation
of its practitioners, is impossible to sustain.
   Third World debt has tripled in the past nine years, from
$600 billion to $1.8 trillion. There are three main kinds of
international debt. First, there is debt owed to commercial
banks. Second, there is government-to-government, or
bilateral debt. Third, there is debt owed to multilateral
lending agencies such as the IMF, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank. This is the type of debt
that makes up a large portion of the loans owed by the
English-speaking nations of the Caribbean.
   Multilateral debt has two distinct disadvantages: No
rescheduling whatsoever is permitted. And the Brady Plan's
debt relief applies only to commercial debt, not IMF and
other agencies' loans.
   In the case of Jamaica, only 8% of our debt is commercial,
while 45% is owed to multilateral agencies. Clearly, in our
case a Brady Plan has little relevance. Further, our total
debt of $4.5 billion represents some 180% of the island's
gross national product, and debt servicing requires 40% of
our annual export receipts. Jamaica is one of the most
indebted nations on a percapita basis.
   Obviously, the island's capacity for sustained growth is
severely constrained by this burden, despite a confident and
aggressive private sector that enjoys both the confidence and
backing of the government and the cooperation of the trade
union movement. Expansion plans are constantly frustrated by
the shortage of foreign exchange and even private foreign
capital, which we solicit and encourage vigorously, tends to
be apprehensive.
   Finally, Jamaica is burdened by the fact that no
rescheduling of any loan from a multilateral agency is
permitted. Every single dollar of interest and principal
repayment must be met, in terms of the original agreement, on
the due date -- or we face the prospect of the suspension of
all disbursements under existing programs. In 1988-89, the
net flow of capital from Jamaica to the IMF and the World
Bank was -- incredibly -- $208 million. During this period,
the island borrowed $70 million.
   Normally, one would not have any quarrel with these strict
arrangements, which would be the normal and proper
obligations of a commercial debtor. But these are not normal
times, nor is this a normal situation. The whole world shares
responsibility for the debt crisis. The inflationary
explosion following the Vietnam War and the OPEC oil price
hikes, the ensuing stagnation, rising interest rates and
tightening money market, the careless lending of commercial
banks, the inexperience or in some cases shortsighted
borrowing by developing countries together with many other
factors contributed to the crisis in which we are all now
trapped.
   Ironically, there have been great advances in
debtor-country management capabilities and understanding of
strict financial prudence. And there is now general reliance
upon market-driven strategies of private-sector-led growth.
However, all these incalculable advantages garnered from
experience to provide the basis for a new maturity in today's
debtor countries are negated by the sheer weight of the debt
burden.
   The lending agencies exert pressure to force debtor
countries to implement immediately policies that may be
justified in strict economic theory but that are impossible
to attain overnight. Import duties and internal interest
policies are good examples. High duties encourage
inefficiency but their immediate removal can kill off
industries that could become competitive if given time to
adjust. In the area of interest rates one lending agency is
proposing policies that would require Jamaican small farmers
to pay 22% on development loans. No business can hope to
expand successfully at that interest rate.
   Third World debtor countries represent more than half of
humanity, that is to say, more than half of the potential
market for the exports of creditor nations. The debt crisis
restricts the capacity of developing countries to buy the
exports of developed countries -- which, in turn, hurts
developed nations.
   I am not advocating a retreat from the sanctity of
contract, nor do I expect Jamaica to be permitted to walk
away from its debt obligations. However, common sense and
conscience surely demand that the major powers that determine
the policies of the multilateral lending agencies take an
urgent look at those agencies' inflexible rules, rules that
have long since outgrown justification and now add to the
strangling burdens of countries like Jamaica.
   Surely the time has also come to take a new look at
bilateral debts. Canada's recent unilateral cancellation of
all debts held by English-speaking Caribbean countries is a
powerful example. The sum involved -- $183 million -- might
be small in the context of total Third World debt, but it is
relatively large in the context of the Canadian economy.
   Could not the reduced military expenditures accompanying
the end of the Cold War be recycled into a new facility to
supplement IMF/World Banks funds? This new pool of money
could be used to reschedule debts due to the multilateral
lending agencies, restricted to those nations undergoing the
effects of structural adjustment.
   A significant first step would be the creation of a small
expert group at the Group of Seven's Houston Summit in June.
The group's mission would be to come up with practical
recommendations in, say, three months, to ease the debt
crisis. The menu of remedies to deal with the problem is
adequate. What we need now is the vision and the will to act
in response to common sense as much as conscience, and that
will safeguard democracy in my part of the world.
