   RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Brazilian government, in a limited
sign of confidence that its tough anti-inflation program is
working, lifted price controls on a handful of raw materials
and industrial goods.
   The government also said it wouldn't authorize increases
in May for products whose prices remain controlled.

   In a related move, President Fernando Collor de Mello
asked the government to speed up its studies on allowing
imports of foreign cars and letting more foreign auto makers
start up operations. The move is a step toward liberalizing
the sheltered Brazilian market and a sign of displeasure at
the domestic auto industry's production stoppages and high
prices since the anti-inflation plan went into effect in
March.
   In announcing the lifting of price controls, the
government didn't list specific products. Instead, it
specified which products would remain frozen, implying that
all others are now free. Prices that remain frozen include
all basic foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, cars, trucks,
appliances, cigarettes, glass, cement, fertilizer, rents,
school bills, and electricity, telephone and water rates.
   Analysts said the step is a far cry from the near-total
lifting of price controls the government envisaged only days
ago. This indicates fretfulness that inflation is still a
threat, despite government insistence that it has been
snuffed out, a claim that many economists and unions contest.
The government slapped on price controls on March 16 as part
of its sweeping plan to rid Brazil of its runaway inflation,
which exceeded 4,800% in the preceding 12 months. The plan's
centerpiece is an 18-month freeze on about 70% of the money
in circulation in the Brazilian economy.
