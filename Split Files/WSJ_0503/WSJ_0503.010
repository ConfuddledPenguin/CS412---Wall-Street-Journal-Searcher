   WASHINGTON -- T. Boone Pickens, the Texas shareholder
advocate and corporate raider, said he will disclose the
results of a survey of 2,500 Japanese auto parts suppliers,
in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee tomorrow,
that indicate dissatisfaction with Japan's system of
corporate ownership.
   Mr. Pickens, who owns a 26% stake in Koito Manufacturing
Co. through his Boone Co., is fighting Japan's "keiretsu"
system, under which parent companies dictate pricing policies
of affiliated companies from which they purchase supplies.

   Under the system, Toyota Motor Corp., which owns 19% of
Koito's stock, may dictate prices of the lights they purchase
from Koito for Toyota cars. Mr. Pickens asserts that the
keiretsu system gives Toyota "hidden dividends," and benefits
at the expense of Koito's other shareholders.
   Mr. Pickens said that responses to the survey indicate
dissatisfaction with the system. A Japanese executive, whose
identity will be hidden by a screen, is also scheduled to
testify about the system.
   Mr. Pickens, in an interview, said he expects to earn a
profit on his Koito's holdings by exerting pressure to
broaden the potential buyers of Koito's products. "We believe
Koito has great opportunity to expand its business," he said.
"They aren't allowed to do it, because they are a Toyota
captive."
   He added that other parts suppliers with relationships to
parent companies similar to Koito's are pleased that Mr.
Pickens is attempting to upset the status quo. "Other peer
companies to Koito are in communication with us," he said.
