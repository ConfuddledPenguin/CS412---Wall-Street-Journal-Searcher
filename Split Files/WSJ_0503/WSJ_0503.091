   Tokyo stock prices finished higher, boosted by the pace of
strong advances by domestic demand-related stocks such as
steels and shipbuildings, traders said.
   In London, share prices finished higher in light trading,
largely led by strength in stock-index futures and mark-ups
that supported the underlying shares.

   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 483.81 points at
30173.64, its high for the day. The most recent time the
index closed above 30000 points was April 9.
   The index gained 105.03 points Tuesday.
   Volume remained thin, as most investors avoided largely
increasing their positions ahead of holidays in Japan today
and tomorrow, traders said.
   An estimated 480 million shares changed hands on the first
section, improving from 245 million shares Tuesday. Advancers
widely outnumbered decliners 773 to 196, while 130 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, also boasted strong performances Wednesday,
rising 33.03 points, or 1.49%, to 2247.81. The index gained
8.82 points Tuesday.
   The second section index, which added 16.19 points
Tuesday, jumped 32.82 points, or 0.93%, to close at 3579.96.
Volume was estimated at 10 million shares, up from seven
million shares Tuesday.
   Almost all sectors finished with gains yesterday as
expectations for future advances were fueled by the yen's
stability, participants said.
   But brokers who had been trying to boost trading in May by
establishing electronics shares as a trade focus ended the
day in uncertainty, reflecting a rumor spread during the
afternoon session.
   The rumor, which was said to have been started by a
foreign brokerage house, said that TDK's earnings predictions
for the fiscal year may be lowered. Share prices of TDK and
related companies such as Sony and Pioneer fell sharply
during the last hour before bouncing back halfway toward the
end of the day.
   The market closed without confirming the information on
TDK, as the company has been closed all week, extending this
week's national holidays.
   Shigeru Akiba, head of equity trade at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
International, said that if the rumor is true, many
securities companies would have to revise their strategy of
promoting the electronics sector as a market leader.
   A senior trader at Wako Securities said the market must
wait until next week to weigh the impact of the rumor. But
yesterday's sell-off of high-priced, high-tech shares didn't
involve general investors, and was largely done by dealers
who were trading for their own accounts, he noted.
   Because dealers had bought these stocks Tuesday, they
reduced their holdings ahead of the holidays today and
tomorrow, the trader said.
   Some participants predicted that stock prices will rise in
May, with the Nikkei index approaching 32000 points.
   Helped by the yen's stability, investors are gradually
regaining confidence on the stock market, despite growing
expectations for higher interest rates in the U.S. and West
Germany, said Kimitoshi Hasegawa, deputy vice president
supervising separate account management at Dai-Ichi Mutual
Life Co.
   Participants were also encouraged by favorable technical
news that the Nikkei index at Tuesday's finish climbed above
its 25-day moving average line for the first time this year,
indicating that stock prices have turned technically upward
from their continuous downward trend since the beginning of
this year, traders said.
   Winners were spread among large-capital shares such as
steel and ship-building companies that rebounded from their
Tuesday losses. Construction companies and other
public-spending related shares, such as road builders, were
also higher.
   Sumitomo Metal was up 14 yen at 604 yen (nine cents to
$3.80), while Kobe Steel gained 19 yen to 595 yen. Kawasaki
Heavy Industries advanced 13 yen to 848 yen and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries rose 16 yen to 939 yen.
   TDK finished at 6900 yen, down 160 yen, and Sony was down
130 yen at 8520 yen. But many other electronics shares ended
the day firmer or unchanged.
   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that in the week
ended Friday, the balance of margin buying declined 158.8
billion yen to 7.585 trillion yen. The balance of short
positions outstanding fell 100.9 billion yen to 612.7 billion
yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share
index closed up 19.7 points at 2137.6. The index reached its
intraday high of 2145.1 around midafternoon and posted its
low for the day of 2121.7 at the start of official trading.
   The Financial Times 30 share index ended up 14.5 points at
1678. Volume was 433 million shares, modestly better than the
370.8 million a day earlier.
   Several diverse factors, including early firmness on Wall
Street, a flurry of bullish corporate results and a shortage
of stock helped push the market up, dealers said.
   Caution about the U.K.'s economic and political situation
-- currently focused on today's scheduled municipal
elections, in which Margaret Thatcher's Tory Party is
forecast to take a drubbing -- is damping new investor
enthusiasm, traders said.
   Dealers said the technical bounce that gripped the market
at the start of the week has probably run its course. They
predicted that the market would most likely come off its
current levels shortly and possibly even test the technical
support level of 2050.
   To stimulate fresh position-taking, "what you need is a
little bit of corporate activity" such as concrete takeover
bids, one trader said.
   Bidding speculation buoyed the insurance sector, as
expectations that French group Axa-Midi might try for a U.K.
composite insurer following the collapse last week of
Axa-Midi's efforts to buy B.A.T's U.S. insurance unit,
Farmers Group.
   Commercial Union, regarded the most likely candidate for a
takeover bid by the French insurer, shot up 11 pence to 455
pence; elsewhere in the sector, General Accident rose 5 pence
to #10.13, and Royal Insurance climbed 2 pence to 429 pence.
   Favorable results by the Royal Bank of Scotland bolstered
banking shares, which have been depressed since Midland Bank
released a profit warning last week. Pretax profit for the
RBS's first half ending March 31 was up 1.5%, beating
analysts' expectations and pushing the share price up 10
pence to 169 pence.
   Elsewhere in Europe and South Africa, prices closed higher
in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, and Stockholm; and were mixed in
Amsterdam and Milan. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Manila and Wellington; lower in Taipei; and mixed in
Singapore. The Seoul market was closed for a holiday.

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
