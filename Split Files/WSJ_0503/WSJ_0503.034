   SEYMOUR, Conn. -- Summagraphics Corp. said it completed
its previously announced acquisition of the Houston
Instrument division of Ametek Inc. for $30.2 million.
   The price consists of $25.2 million in cash and a $5
million five-year convertible subordinated note that will
entitle Ametek, a New York-based industrial manufacturing
concern, to buy 8.8% of Summagraphics's shares outstanding.
