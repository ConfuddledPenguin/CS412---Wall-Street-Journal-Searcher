   Is the tobacco industry marketing to kids?
   Cigarette makers vehemently deny it, but that's one of the
hottest questions being raised by anti-smoking groups. They
cite these recent cases:

<TEXT>
   -- A recent memo from an RJR Nabisco Inc. division manager
discussing plans to promote cigarettes with premiums,
typically free gifts, told sales representatives to pinpoint
certain stores -- including those "in close proximity . . .
to high schools."
   -- A new Winston Cup newsletter, published for fans of the
cigarette-sponsored car races, has a "Kids' Korner" with a
puzzle and a contest. The child who writes the funniest
caption for a photo of kids driving mini-race cars past a
Winston Cup banner wins a Winston Cup sweatshirt.
   -- An ad for free Camel T-shirts in Sports Illustrated
magazine has led some teen-agers to call a toll-free number
and say they're older than the offer's limit of 21. After the
shirts arrive, they are mailed coupons for free packs of
Camel.
   In these instances, RJR says any appeal to children was a
mistake, unintended or not its doing. And the tobacco
industry says its advertising is for adult eyes only. Still,
cigarette brands are showing up in a growing number of the
staples of modern youth, such as video games and giveaways
for rock-music compact disks. Critics say tobacco companies
have a powerful economic motive for targeting youths:
Research shows that 90% of people who smoke started before
they were 21.
   What's more, tobacco critics fear that the increasing use
of what they see as youth-oriented promotions is taking hold.
A widely followed University of Michigan survey shows the
prevalence of smoking among high school seniors has been flat
in recent years, but the Gallup Youth Survey, an independent
study of children's behavior, shows that the percentage of
13- to 15-year-olds who smoke jumped to 11% last year from 7%
in 1988.
   "Children have to replenish the market for tobacco
companies," says Rep. Tom Luken (D., Ohio), who has held
several hearings on cigarette marketing to win support for a
bill to severely restrict tobacco ads. "You'd have to be
blind, deaf and insensitive to deny that they are trying to
appeal to young people."
   The tobacco industry denies that it's focusing any
marketing efforts on children. The Tobacco Institute, the
industry trade association, says it has rules to shield
children from promotions. Under the self-imposed measures,
cigarette companies can't advertise in publications read
primarily by young people. They can't use models in ads who
are -- or even appear to be -- under age 25. They can't offer
free samples to people under 21. And they can't offer samples
within two blocks of schools, college campuses or
playgrounds.
   An RJR spokeswoman says the memo dealing with high schools
was simply a "mistake." The memo, issued in January by a
division manager in Sarasota, Fla., was corrected within 48
hours, she says, to explain that the manager clearly violated
company policy in targeting secondary-school children. She
adds that the manager was disciplined, but wouldn't
elaborate.
   Critics of the tobacco industry acknowledge the absence of
a "smoking gun" in the apparent connection between the
tobacco industry and children. For instance, RJR, which makes
Winston cigarettes, says it never saw or approved a copy of
the Winston Cup newsletter. Sunbelt Video Inc. of Charlotte,
N.C., which produces a Winston Cup TV show, says it published
the newsletter for the show's race fans, including children.
   But critics say the subtleness of the marketing is what
makes it such a problem. Cigarette companies "are very
clever. They aren't sponsoring cartoon shows on Saturday
morning or going to kindergarten classes and giving away free
cigarettes," says Joe B. Tye, president of Stop Teenage
Addiction to Tobacco. "You have to look at a lot of
circumstantial evidence."
   One piece of evidence surfaced last summer in testimony by
a former Winston model before a congressional subcommittee.
David Goerlitz, a model who appeared in Winston ads during
the 1980s, said the ads were designed "to appeal to children
and teen-agers." Mr. Goerlitz said RJR marketing experts
interviewed teen-agers in shopping malls, showing them
pictures of him and other "Winston men" to choose the most
effective photos for the ads -- a charge RJR denies.
   More recently, the subcommittee's attention has turned to
whether cigarette names appearing in video-arcade games are
an advertising ploy. Doctors Ought to Care, an anti-smoking
group, recently asked the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate certain games. In one, Super Monaco GP, Marlboro
race cars whiz past Marlboro signs. Philip Morris Cos., which
makes Marlboro, says it didn't approve the use of its logos
and demanded that the machine's maker, Sega Enterprises Inc.
of San Jose, Calif., drop the Marlboro name from the games.
   Sega, which says it is removing the trademarks, says they
appeared as "a game designer's innocent attempt to mimic"
real racing.
   Sega and Philip Morris say they had no agreement on using
the Marlboro name, but smoking critics have their doubts.
Indeed, the flap even prompted a bill, being considered by
legislators in Sega's home state of California, to outlaw any
mention of cigarette or alcohol brands in video games used
mainly by minors.
   Home video games may come into the spotlight next. Ferrari
Formula One, computer racing software made by Electronic Arts
of San Mateo, Calif., shows the Marlboro name on the box
cover several times, and the game itself shows the Marlboro
logo on a car driver's helmet, on signs and on the car.
Philip Morris and Electronic Arts say they had no agreement
to include the Marlboro logo in the game.
   A Philip Morris offer of a free rock-music compact disk
with the purchase of its Parliament Lights cigarettes early
last year drew a stinging editorial from CD Review magazine.
"It's pitiful that the CD is being aligned with the stench of
cigarettes," wrote Larry Canale, the magazine's executive
editor. "Parliament is targeting a young crowd -- the
impressionable 16- to 17-year-olds who are most attracted to
the type of music on the disk." Philip Morris counters that
the promotion was actually aimed at adult consumers, who buy
the bulk of CDs, and says it specifically selected artists,
such as Tina Turner, to appeal to older listeners.
   RJR's Camel advertising has been widely criticized for its
appeal to children. Intentional or not, the redesigned
cartoon camel character, accompanied by beautiful women and
race cars and jets, has intrigued youngsters. Tobacco
billboard opponent Jacqueline Jackson says that when she
recently asked fifth- and sixth-graders at Detroit's J.R.
King Elementary School what they knew about Camel, they
rattled off specific details from ads: the kind of jackets
the camel wears, the number of planes shown and the types of
cars. At Atlanta's Northside High School, Camel hats have
been hot items.
   RJR says it doesn't believe the Camel cartoon campaign
appeals to children. And the brand itself, says a
spokeswoman, is targeted mainly at 21- to 30-year olds.
   The free Camel T-shirt promotion has been particularly
controversial. At a congressional hearing in March, Rep. Jim
Slattery (D., Kan.) charged that youths were the real goal of
the advertising. He told of a 13-year-old in Simsbury, Conn.,
who called the ad's toll-free number, indicated he was over
21 (the minimum age for the offer), and was added to a
company mailing list. Shortly after he received the T-shirt,
the boy was mailed a flier for three free packs of Camels.
"When you are giving away T-shirts, you are targeting
children," said Rep. Slattery in his testimony. "You aren't
targeting adults."
   RJR records show the boy claimed he was 24 and smoked
Marlboro Lights, a spokeswoman says. "Parents ultimately have
to be responsible for whether or not their children lie," she
says.
   Tobacco critics say even subtle imagery should be stamped
out. Bubble-gum cigarettes modeled after real brands have
been sold for years, and toys have popped up resembling
cigarette packs and lighters. Cigarette makers say they try
to eradicate trademark infringements.
   But smoking activists say the companies ignore such
products because having their brand names mixed with candy
names, on store shelves or in vending machines, adds an air
of respectability to otherwise controversial products. In
contrast, says Edward Popper, a tobacco expert and marketing
professor at Bryant College, Smithfield, R.I., "If someone
came up with fake Coca-Cola, Coke attorneys would be in their
office immediately."
   John W. Richards Jr., who is president of Doctors Ought to
Care and has written medical journal articles on the effects
of tobacco ads on youths, worries that the pervasiveness of
cigarette names sends a dangerous message to youngsters --
namely, that cigarettes can't be all that bad if they appear
in videos, on billboards and at sporting events.
   Some children do seem to take cigarette advertising for
granted. When the Junior League of Washington dispatched
junior high students to collect information for an alcohol
and tobacco billboard study last year, one student, Angela
Austin, jotted some notes about a Salem ad. "It makes me
mad," she wrote, referring to some graffiti around the ad.
She was unfazed, however, by the placement of the Salem ad on
an ice cream truck.
