   MINNEAPOLIS -- Control Data Corp.'s chief executive
officer apologized to shareholders for the company's costly
past and said this year's modest earnings expectation is
"only a first step on a long road" back to financial
recovery.
   In a candid appraisal of the business and criticism of his
predecessors, Lawrence Perlman said the helm he inherited
wasn't always manned by those who "thought in terms of
building shareholder value."

   Although he mentioned no names, Mr. Perlman said previous
managers had failed to "build into its culture the discipline
of constant attention to controlling expenses and reducing
costs." As a result, in losing $1.5 billion over the past
five years, "we have asked stockholders, customers, employees
and the community at large to endure a great deal."
   And in an apparent reference to founder William C.
Norris's dreams of making Control Data a leader in addressing
"unmet societal needs," one that drifted into such
investments as hydroponic herbs and windmill farms, Mr.
Perlman said this:
   "We will not allow promises of success in an indeterminate
future to be excuses for failure to meet financial
commitments in the present. Decisions about where we invest
the stockholders' money for the long term will be based on
financial analysis and reasonable expectations of returns on
investment -- not on hope, not on emotion."
   For the near term, Mr. Perlman voiced caution, suggesting
that some Wall Street earnings estimates for the company this
year may be too high. Noting that the range is between $1 and
$1.50 a share, he said, "we do not yet feel comfortable above
the midportion of that range," indicating that much would
depend on secondhalf results.
   Still, he said, $1 a share would be more than the
cumulative earnings of the company's computer businesses
since 1983. "At the same time, such performance is
unacceptable beyond this year," Mr. Perlman added.
   Last year the computer services and hardware concern lost
$680.4 million, or $16.11 a share, on revenue of $2.9 billion
as it completed a drastic restructuring -- salvage effort. In
the first quarter, Control Data earned $6.8 million, or 16
cents a share, on revenue of $421.6 million, although Mr.
Perlman noted at the annual meeting here that 13 cents of the
per-share figure came from a building sale.
   Mr. Perlman also expressed regrets at the carnage the
company's misfortunes had brought on its work force. But
while "many fine people" lost their jobs, "the alternative
would have meant the loss of the whole company."
   Despite his criticism of the past, Mr. Perlman said he is
cautiously sanguine about the future, partly because "people
are beginning to treat the company's money as if it were
their own."
