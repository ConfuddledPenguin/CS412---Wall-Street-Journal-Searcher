   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said it hasn't found
much evidence of a large-scale credit crunch in the U.S.
   Reporting on a survey of its 12 district banks, the Fed
said: "There is little evidence that a general `credit
crunch' is developing; the majority of businesses say they
have not seen any change in credit terms and have had no
trouble getting credit."

   In recent months, concern has grown over reports that
banks and thrifts have become reluctant to make loans to
businesses. Analysts said they might be reacting to pressure
from government regulators and signs of softness in the
economy. Some economists have worried that credit could
become scarce enough to push the economy into a recession.
   While the Fed said it didn't detect a wholesale credit
crunch in its latest survey, it did report that most
districts cited cases of credit-tightening by banks --
particularly in lending to real estate developers and new
small businesses.
   The Boston Fed, which covers most of New England, said
small businesses have found it more costly and difficult to
obtain credit as a result of financial trouble at many of the
region's banks. It said banks in the region are requiring
small firms to increase collateral and provide personal
guarantees. And some banks are calling current loans.
   But the Fed said such tightening seems limited to lending
to smaller firms. "Most large- and medium-sized
manufacturers, in contrast, are experiencing no difficulties
obtaining credit," the report said.
   Meanwhile, in the South, a financial institution withdrew
support for an office complex midway through the project,
according to the Atlanta Fed, which cited a reluctance among
some banks in the region to "engage in further real estate
lending given the overbuilding which has occurred in most
markets." Credit for other businesses and consumers in the
South, however, "is said to be available as usual," the
report said.
   The periodic Fed reports are titled "Survey of Current
Economic Conditions," but are often known as the "Beige
Book." The latest one covered economic activity in April and
was prepared for use by Fed policy-makers before their
scheduled meeting in Washington on May 15.
   Generally, the report indicates that economic activity
continues to expand slowly across the country. Manufacturing,
which has been in the doldrums for most of the past year, is
improving in more than half of the districts. Retail spending
is growing, although slowly. Real estate markets continue to
be weak in much of the country, but activity is vigorous in
some spots, such as Seattle.
   The report's findings may make the central bank officials
feel more comfortable about deciding to raise interest rates
at their coming meeting. Many analysts expect Fed officials
to consider such a move, given recent worrisome inflation
statistics and signs that the economy may be picking up its
pace a bit after slowing severely late last year.
   Following is a summary of the activity in each of the Fed
regions:
                                                                                                       

   BOSTON (The Boston Fed covers Massachusetts, Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and most of Connecticut):
The New England economy is still sluggish. Manufacturing
health varies by industry; firms producing products connected
to the defense, auto and construction industries are still
weak. Half the firms surveyed plan to slash capital spending
from last year's levels. But others are planning increases.
Home prices are still falling.
                                                                                                       

   NEW YORK (New York State, northern New Jersey and
Fairfield County, Conn.): Activity is mixed, and the region's
economy shows no clear signs of either improving or
deteriorating. Retail sales vary from store to store. Housing
construction is declining, but interest in home-buying
appears to be picking up. Unemployment rates still remain
below the national average. Demand for commercial loans is
down from a year ago.
                                                                                                       

   PHILADELPHIA (Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern
New Jersey): The economy in this region shows hints of mild
improvement over the first quarter. Retail sales in April
were better than the same month last year. Spring apparel has
sold fairly well, and merchants haven't had to resort to
steep markdowns. Though manufacturers continue to report
falling business, the rate of decline is slowing. Demand for
business loans is picking up. But bankers say that, with a
few exceptions, they are restricting real estate lending to
current customers and limiting the size of the loans.
                                                                                                       

   CLEVELAND (Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky
and northern West Virginia): Consumer spending and
manufacturing output have increased. Concern about inflation
is growing. Auto production is rebounding after a dismal
first quarter, and manufacturers are canceling planned
cutbacks. Orders for cars have picked up. So have orders for
steel, but the Fed district here believes the increased
bookings may be in anticipation of a small increase in steel
sheet prices scheduled for July.
                                                                                                       

   RICHMOND (Virginia, Maryland, North and South Carolina,
District of Columbia, most of West Virginia): Both retail
sales and manufacturers' orders improved last month. But
large banks reported a slight increase in problem loans,
particularly among loans for commercial real estate. Also,
both banks and borrowers reported stricter lending
requirements for commercial real estate and other types of
business loans.
                                                                                                       

   ATLANTA (Georgia, Alabama, Florida, eastern Tennessee,
southern Mississippi, southern Louisiana): There was some
good news on the inflation front: Prices of raw materials are
generally stable, manufacturers in this region found. Also,
employers haven't noticed any renewed pressure to drive up
wages; generally they are settling for wage increases of no
more than 5%. Real estate markets are still soft. Clothing
sales are strong, but auto sales are slightly below year-ago
levels. Oil drilling is steady. Several firms in Louisiana
said that increasing concern over the environment is
discouraging new drilling.
                                                                                                       

   CHICAGO (Northern Illinois, Iowa, lower peninsula of
Michigan, most of Indiana, southern Wisconsin): Business
conditions are generally improving here. Car production in
the second quarter is expected to be about 20% higher than in
the first quarter. Makers of other consumer goods also are
stepping up output. And consumer spending is generally
growing. An analyst for a major discount store chain said
sales in February and March were the best for that period
since 1983. Construction is stronger here than in many parts
of the country.
                                                                                                       

   ST. LOUIS (Eastern Missouri, Arkansas, western Kentucky,
western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, southern Illinois,
southern Indiana): Economic activity here is still sluggish,
as it has been for the past year. Numerous plant closings,
layoffs and production slowdowns have been reported at
factories across the region. Consumer spending is flat or
barely growing. Some analysts blamed wet weather in March for
keeping people away from stores. Loans outstanding are
growing at the district's banks, so a credit crunch doesn't
seem to be occurring here. A March freeze destroyed most of
the peach crop in Tennessee and Kentucky and damaged some
apple, strawberry, alfalfa and winter wheat crops.

   MINNEAPOLIS (Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota,
northern Wisconsin, upper peninsula of Michigan):
Unemployment is lower than the national average in many parts
of this region. Even in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, big
cutbacks in computer and electronics jobs have been offset by
strong growth in positions at medical-technology firms.
Unlike what has happened in many areas of the country,
manufacturing employment in this region in February was
slightly higher than a year earlier. Retailers report strong
sales throughout the district. While new car sales are still
soft, the used car market is vigorous. Credit has tightened
only modestly, and there is no credit crunch. Mining remains
one of the strongest sectors in the district.
                                                                                                       

   KANSAS CITY (Western Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska,
Wyoming, Colorado, northern New Mexico): Loan demand is
generally slackening, but the economy here continues to grow
modestly. Retailers don't expect prices to increase much in
the near future. Auto sales are improving slightly in some
states. Home sales are still slow, and prices remain
generally stable. The winter wheat crop is in good condition.
                                                                                                       

   DALLAS (Texas, northern Louisiana, southern New Mexico):
Slow economic growth continues here. Expansion in the service
sector has lead to labor shortages in some professions, such
as health care. Construction employment is growing, but
building-contract values are starting to weaken again. Oil
and gas drilling is strong. Bountiful rainfall and rising
prices have improved the outlook for agriculture.
Manufacturing has picked up somewhat in the past couple of
months. Credit is tight in the district, but that is nothing
new. "Many smaller businesses say their long-established
relationships with their banks have allowed them to avoid
funding problems," the report says.
                                                                                                       

   SAN FRANCISCO (California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii): Businesses here
are still doing relatively well, many better than the
national average. Wage and price increases are averaging
between 3% and 5%. Manufacturing industries, particularly
aerospace firms, are reasonably healthy. California real
estate markets are cooling from their torrid expansion of
recent years, but "prices and sales activity remain robust in
the more affordable parts of the state," the report says. In
Seattle, real estate activity is frenetic. Construction is
strong in Hawaii, but softness persists in Arizona. Most
banks in the West report good or stable conditions.
