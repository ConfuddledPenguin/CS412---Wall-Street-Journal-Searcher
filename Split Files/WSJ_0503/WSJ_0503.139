   Pure Happiness, Please?

<TEXT>
   Even though I recognize
   What's been a blessing
   In disguise,
   I hope it's not
   Too much to ask
   For future ones
   Without the mask.
   -- May Richstone.

   Metamorphosis
                                                                                                       

   Spreadsheets were once analyses
   Constructed with paper and pens;
   Now they're electronic figments
   Created in computer dens.
   -- Bud Stiller.
