   "Miami Blues" has such an original pulse, it cons you into
thinking it might be deep. It isn't, but what a good idea to
combine the low pleasures of B-movie pulp (sex and extreme
violence) with a wayward wit and a nifty visual style.
   Jonathan Demme produced this dandy little face-off between
a nearly derelict detective and his ex-con nemesis, and he
has embossed it with his quirky sensibility. The picture is
suffused with Mr. Demme's obsession with the hidden darkness
in people and the intrinsic humor he finds in ordinary
things. Things like pork chops, white picket fences, false
teeth, pie.

   The writer and director George Armitage met Mr. Demme when
both of them were learning their craft making pictures for
Roger Corman, the legendary B-movie master. Mr. Demme went on
to make his name at the edges of mainstream moviemaking with
"Melvin and Howard," "Stop Making Sense," "Something Wild"
and "Married to the Mob."
   Mr. Armitage didn't stray nearly as far from his
exploitation beginnings, writing and directing movies for
what used to be the drive-in circuit, movies such as "Private
Duty Nurses," "Hit Man" and "Vigilante Force." Along the way
Mr. Armitage learned inventive and horrible ways to do damage
to body parts, which he vividly puts to use in "Miami Blues."
A Hare Krishna dies convulsively after his finger is crushed.
People are shot in the thigh. An eyebrow is ripped from a
face. Fingers are chopped off.
   Yet the grossness doesn't overwhelm the humor, which is
far more threatened from time to time by the movie's chaotic
structure. But Mr. Armitage keeps pulling you back in with a
fresh view of something through the inventive shots he's
dreamed up with his skillful director of photography, Tak
Fujimoto. Their Miami seems like someplace new, not just
another rearrangement of the cool pastels of "Miami Vice,"
though there is the occasional flash of a brilliant sky blue
suit and a flamingo pink house.
   Also like the television show and Mr. Demme's own films,
this one's rhythms are set by the soundtrack, composed by
Gary Chang. So it's not surprising that the movie was
produced, with Mr. Demme, by Gary Goetzman, the composer and
former record-industry executive who supervised the music for
"Something Wild" and "Married to the Mob."
   Mr. Armitage drew his story from one of the late Charles
Willeford's Hoke Moseley detective novels. Moseley isn't
hardbitten or world-weary or any of the usual cliches. As
played by Fred Ward, Moseley has traveled well beyond
world-weary. He doesn't have teeth. There's something awful
about the gummy way he talks, the suggestion of drool. He has
false teeth, but they don't fit correctly, so he keeps them
on his desk.
   The first time he appears on screen he's toothless, and
that's the picture that stays in your head, even when he pops
his teeth back in. He's not oblivious to the fact that he
looks like a geezer; he seems to enjoy it in some perverse
way. He lives in a hotel whose other occupants appear to have
retired long ago, and he likes to tell people who call that
the man at the front desk can't hear.
   Mr. Ward is a very good character actor who can fill in
several lines of missing dialogue with a look on his face.
Moseley knows the world works in mysterious and often absurd
ways, so he doesn't get too bent out of shape when he's
called to investigate a murder that could be just an assault.
It's the case of the Hare Krishna killed by a broken finger.
As Moseley's partner puts it, if the perpetrator merely
snapped the guy's finger, it's assault. "But if the guy knew
Krishnas had a weird habit of dying every time their fingers
break," well, then he'd be a murderer.
   Though this is a Hoke Moseley story, the gum-mouthed
detective becomes a sideshow to the main circus, who is
Junior, a charming nihilistic psychopath who frequently robs
and occasionally kills. He is played by Alec Baldwin, another
talented character actor who became a movie star a few months
ago with the success of "The Hunt for Red October." His
Junior has a dangerous strut, an automatic pilot walk that
doesn't deviate from course for anyone or anything. With his
crew cut and big grin and frequently exposed biceps and pecs,
he's not unlike Richard Gere, except that Mr. Baldwin always
appears to be fully awake. Maybe the blue eyes glint
menacingly just a tad too often, but it works. The more sweet
and engaging his Junior seems to be, the scarier he becomes,
like a pretty volcano that's been quiet much too long for
comfort.
   Eventually Junior steals Moseley's wallet (but leaves the
money), his false teeth and his police badge and for a time
plays cop. The picture never quite lives up to the comic
possibilities in this, and indeed it goes a little haywire
trying to figure them out.
   Junior doesn't have a clue as to what's crooked or
straight, but he settles into a perversely "normal"
domesticity with a prostitute called Pepper whose real name
is Susie. Jennifer Jason Leigh has an impenetrable face and
serious manner that can make her seem very innocent and
sincere or very dimwitted. Her Susie seems to be all three,
happily cooking big square meals for Junior and installing a
white picket fence in front of their pink Floridian bungalow.
The miracle of this movie and these actors is that you
actually think twice about what happens between Junior and
Susie.

   VIDEO TIP: Still, no one can do Jonathan Demme quite like
Jonathan Demme can. Though the shift from comedy to terror
was a bit abrupt, "Something Wild" remains a most ingenious
amalgamation of music, comedy and fearfulness. Sister Mary's
version of the reggae theme song "Wild Thing" is just great.
