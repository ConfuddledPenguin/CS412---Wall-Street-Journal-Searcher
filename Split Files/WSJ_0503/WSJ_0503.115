   Trading in securities of Integrated Resources Inc. on the
New York Stock Exchange will be suspended before the opening
on May 16, and the exchange said it will seek to delist the
issues.
   The exchange said it is taking the action because New
York-based Integrated has fallen below exchange requirements
related to aggregate market value of publicly held shares and
of shares outstanding; average net income for the past three
years; and net tangible assets available to common stock.

   Integrated filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in February. The
company, once a high-flying financial-services concern, now
manages more than 600 partnerships in diverse businesses. It
had a third-quarter loss of $183.8 million, or $24.81 a
share.
   The exchange said that in addition to common stock, its
action affects the following securities: three issues of
preferred stock; one issue of senior subordinated debentures;
three issues of senior subordinated notes; and three issues
of senior notes.
