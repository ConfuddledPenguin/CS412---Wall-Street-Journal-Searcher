   It would be nice to be a fly on the walls inside the
Kremlin right now, listening to what the men of the Politburo
made of the scene in Red Square on Tuesday. We wonder if
anyone is talking about the inextricable relationship between
the two ideas for which Mikhail Gorbachev is famous: glasnost
and perestroika.
   The immediate problem that led to reform in the Soviet
Union was the backwardness and impending collapse of the
economy. To meet this problem, the analysis ran, you needed
fundamental economic reform, perestroika. However, the frozen
political system made this impossible, and needed to be
shaken up by glasnost, an intellectual opening. This was all
quite correct, but in the event, there has been no economic
reform. The signs in the square -- "Communists Don't have any
illusions, you're bankrupt" -- are the result of glasnost
without perestroika.

   Mr. Gorbachev is now faced with two basic options. He
could presumably use the KGB and army to close down glasnost
with repression, but this would at the very least leave his
economy on the skids and at the most risk popular revolt. Or
he could make the leap of actual perestroika and even more
glasnost, throwing his lot clearly with the reformist forces.
   After all, nearly every Soviet economist one speaks to can
offer a thorough, often hilarious critique of the centralized
Soviet system. They can talk about the kinds of market
reforms needed to create growth. But for the past four years,
Mr. Gorbachev has implemented these reforms piecemeal, more
or less soldering various market reforms onto the monstrous
Rube Goldberg contraption the Soviets call their economy.
This has created much pain -- inflation, shortages,
unemployment -- and no gain. The Soviet model needs to be
discarded and replaced with a real market economy, but only
last week Mr. Gorbachev ruled out Polish-style "shock
therapy" for the economy.
   He spoke to a crowd of industrial workers in Sverdlovsk,
some of whom have been tutored to fear the dislocation of
reform. For of course some will lose, and reform is opposed
by forces in thrall to the old order -- some elements of the
armed forces, the Pamyat nationalists, state-controlled
unions and the growing fascist workers' United Front
movement. In his recent actions, and in appointments to his
new Presidential Cabinet, Mr. Gorbachev has been bidding for
the support of this constituency.
   Not least, of course, he has repressed dissident
republics. Yesterday, the Lithuanian government formally
announced its willingness to "suspend" its declaration of
independence. Thus, Mr. Gorbachev's pressure prevailed once
more against another group unhappy with the pace of
perestroika. The repressions so far have been carried out
against Lithuania, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Tomorrow they may
be deployed against Moldavia, Mongolia, Estonia and Ukraine,
or perhaps the free-market administration of Moscow City
Council Chairman Gavriil Popov.
   Yet with at best piecemeal perestroika, the economy
continues to falter, fomenting the distrust and bitterness
that materialized in Red Square. It can only get worse. It is
a recipe for disaster. If the economy isn't set right soon,
political conditions inside the Soviet Union will become
disordered and dangerous.
   The historical currents roiling in the Soviet Union and in
Eastern Europe are enormous. Little Lithuania is not alone;
there are democratic forces that share its goal of personal
and economic freedom across the breadth of the Soviet Union.
Similarly large forces oppose them. To enact the right
policies, and survive the heat, a political leader needs both
political legitimacy and a supporting constituency. Mr.
Gorbachev has to choose which side of the Soviet political
landscape he wishes to be part of, the reformers or the old
guard. At present he is walking a tightrope between them,
alone, surviving on great defensive political skills, but
running the risk of losing the support of both sides.
   With this crisis gathering steam within the Soviet Union,
the position taken by President Bush and most of the West's
political leadership is: Don't rock the boat. It is becoming
clear to us that this policy is shortsighted and most likely
a mistake. Western leaders seem to believe they are helping
Mr. Gorbachev by "supporting" him whichever way he leans.
With all the other pressures operating on him, he has in
effect become not a reformer but an obstacle to reform, and a
milepost on the road to economic disaster and potential
political chaos.
   To "succeed," even to survive, Mr. Gorbachev needs
pressure from the politicians of the West. With their
hands-off-everything policy, the West's leaders haven't
helped him; they have abandoned him.
