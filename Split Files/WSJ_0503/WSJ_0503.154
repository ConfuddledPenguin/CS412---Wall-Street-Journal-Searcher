   NEW YORK -- Inspiration Resources Corp. reported its net
loss widened in the first quarter, to $11.7 million, or 18
cents a share, from $322,000 a year earlier.
   At the company's annual meeting here, Reuben F. Richards,
chairman, president and chief executive officer, blamed lower
base-metals prices at its Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting Co.
subsidiary and a decline in volumes and fertilizer prices at
its agribusiness subsidiary, Terra International Inc. Mr.
Richards said he expects Terra to post second-quarter profit
higher than the $43 million of a year ago.

   First-quarter revenue declined 8.7%, to $268.2 million
from $293.8 million.
   Mr. Richards said the company's coal operations were
profitable, reversing a year-earlier loss.
   Inspiration Resources authorized about $100 million for
capital spending this year, an increase from the year-earlier
$87 million, Mr. Richards said. He added that Inspiration
plans to commit "substantial funds" in the 1990s to
exploration at Hudson Bay Mining, and he expects work to
begin by year end on a more than $140 million project to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at its Flin Flon
metallurgical complex.
   The company plans to open a zinc and copper mine in
northern Manitoba, and to complete a shaft development
project at Hudson Bay's 44%-owned Trout Lake copper and zinc
mine, which are expected to increase overall copper and zinc
production for its own account about 10% this year.
   Mr. Richards said the company, which recently entered the
construction-materials business with the purchase of LTM Inc.
and Rogue Aggregates Inc., expects to expand that business
through acquisitions so that it eventually will account for
20% to 30% of annual pretax earnings.
