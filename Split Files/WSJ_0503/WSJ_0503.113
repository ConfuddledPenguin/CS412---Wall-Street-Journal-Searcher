   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved two loans totaling
$153 million to Poland for transport-sector projects.
   World Bank officials said a $145 million credit will help
finance equipment needed to modernize the country's state-run
railway system. A second loan, for $8 million, will be used
to improve Poland's administration of highways, rail lines
and other transport facilities.
