   WASHINGTON -- World Bank President Barber Conable said he
hopes to launch a fund to make low-interest loans to poor and
middle-income countries for environmental projects.
   Mr. Conable told reporters he plans to seek endorsement
for the fund at a meeting of the bank's development committee
next week.

   The pilot project would make loans totaling $300 million
to $400 million annually for three years. The loans would be
targeted to addressing environmental problems, such as
deforestation or desertification, that affect the global
climate. He said the loans might also be available for
projects such as cleaning up pollution in Eastern Europe.
   The fund would differ from current World Bank programs by
providing subsidized, low-rate loans to middle-income
nations, as well as poor nations. Currently, the bank's
cut-rate financing is available only to the very poorest
nations. Other countries must borrow from the bank at
market-based interest rates.
   Mr. Conable said the subsidy for middle-income nations is
justified because the benefits of environmental projects go
beyond national boundaries. He said the project would also
result in an increase in the bank's environmental staff.
   In answering questions on the program, Mr. Conable refused
to join the debate over whether there is a general trend
toward global warming. But "if there is global change, it
will affect poor people more than rich," he said, and
therefore is a worthy concern for the bank.
   The environmental fund must be approved by the member
nations of the bank, who will also have to provide the money.
The fund will be a cooperative effort of the World Bank, the
United Nations Development Program and the United Nations
Environmental Program.
   The establishment of an environmental fund at the World
Bank was first advocated last year by French officials.
Treasury officials say the U.S. hasn't formulated a position
on the proposal.
