   NEW YORK -- Turner Broadcasting System Inc. is about to
give supermarket shoppers something to do besides thumb
through tabloids while standing in the checkout line.
   Turner's Cable News Network and Act Media Inc. are
expected to announce today that they will begin offering
satellite-delivered news and information programming in
supermarkets throughout the U.S., people familiar with the
deal said.

   The plan is the latest in a series of recent moves by
media concerns to find new ways to reach captive audiences in
public or semipublic places, such as doctors' offices and
schools. Whittle Communications, 50% owned by Time Warner
Inc., has a number of print properties it distributes to
doctors' offices and has launched an ad-supported TV news
program in schools. CNN offers a competing service in schools
with no advertising.
   But the supermarket venture is expected to rely heavily on
advertisers' support. The plan, reportedly dubbed "The
Checkout Channel" during its development, is a partnership
between CNN and Act Media, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Dallas-based Heritage Media Corp. Act Media handles in-store
marketing and promotions.
   Turner and Act Media, which scheduled a news conference
for today, declined to comment. They are expected to announce
the number of stores that will participate and the details of
plans to sell advertising on the programs.
   Turner Broadcasting Chairman and President Ted Turner,
speaking yesterday at an industry luncheon in New York, said
he was "all for commercials, they pay the bills," although he
was opposed to airing them on "CNN Classroom," the
Atlanta-based company's 15-minute daily newscast to schools.
   According to people familiar with the plan, Act Media will
place satellite dishes on top of supermarkets, and
programming supplied by CNN will be beamed to television sets
placed near checkout lanes. The supermarkets will be supplied
with the satellite dishes and television sets.
   Act Media approached the three major networks, as well as
other cable companies, according to network officials who
didn't want to be identified. Network officials were said to
be concerned that the supermarket environment might not be
the optimum place to promote programming and sell
advertising. CNN, by contrast, was said to be eager to
exploit the captive audience.
   Act delined to comment on any discussions with the
broadcast networks.
   An official at National Broadcasting Co., a unit of
General Electric Co., said Act Media approached NBC Cable in
January about the venture. He said the discussions focused on
using programming from NBC's joint venture with Cablevision
Systems Corp., the cable network Consumer News and Business
Channel. "But the investment was enormous, upwards of
millions of dollars," the official said, and NBC decided that
the financial terms weren't beneficial and the only advantage
might be promotional.
   Act Media told broadcast networks that they could promote
their prime-time programs on the channel, people familiar
with the proposal said. But broadcasters were concerned that
the TV shows would annoy cashiers, who might turn down the
volume. "We were told that it would not be a problem," one
network official said. "The TV sets would not have audio
buttons."
