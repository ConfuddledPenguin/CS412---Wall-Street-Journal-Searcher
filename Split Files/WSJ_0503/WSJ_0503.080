   WASHINGTON -- The White House proposed a "complete
overhaul" of a multilateral system of controlling
high-technology exports in order to give Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union more access to Western technology.
   President Bush's aides said the proposal would eliminate
or substantially ease controls on 40 of 120 product
categories that currently are under export restrictions to
those countries, and create a more practical list "from
scratch."

   The Commerce Department said the proposed changes would
eliminate licensing requirements for U.S. exports valued at
billions of dollars annually.
   The Bush plan would release most off-the-shelf personal
computers from the existing controls and give certain Eastern
European countries access to some mainframe computers such as
International Business Machines Corp.'s 4381 MG24, Digital
Equipment Corp.'s VAX 800 and Control Data Corp.'s Cyber 910.
The use of these mainframes could rapidly improve Eastern
Europe's performance in banking, airline reservations and
light industry, U.S. officials said.
   A spokesman for IBM, in Armonk, N.Y., called the proposal
"a very modest first step." He said that critical
applications -- such as banking, education and health-care
systems -- "require substantially more computing power than
is provided by this order."
   Some of the applications cited by U.S. officials -- such
as banking and airline-reservation systems -- have appetites
for computing power that are among the most ravenous of any
computer applications now in use. Those applications tend to
run on hardware that has 10 to 15 times the computing power
of the systems that could be exported to Eastern Europe under
the Bush administration proposal.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Maynard, Mass.-based Digital
Equipment said, "We're quite encouraged by this. We see it as
a positive." He said that under the new proposal, Digital
could sell its MicroVAX 3000 line in areas where it
previously was limited to selling five-year old MicroVAX 2
computers.
   The White House announcement capped three months of
intensive interagency discussions on how the U.S. can meet
the demands of its allies for liberalized trade with the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Coordinating Committee
on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the forum in which
the U.S. discusses such issues with its allies, will hold a
high-level meeting in June in Paris to discuss these issues.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. wants
Cocom to complete work on the new "core list" by year end.
However, the U.S. recommendations for Eastern Europe could be
acted on more quickly because many prospective transactions
await such decisions.
   In addition to giving Eastern European countries favored
treatment in importing mainframe computers, the U.S. also is
proposing to allow those countries to obtain modern
telecommunications equipment, including fiber-optic circuits
with a capacity of as much as 156 megabits and some microwave
transmission systems.
   The U.S. proposal isn't likely to go far enough to suit
West Germany and other European members of Cocom. However,
Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said it would "allow us to engage in a real
and substantive discussion with the allies."
   The White House, heeding the intelligence community's
advice, decided to keep most digital switching equipment on
the restricted list, even for Eastern Europe. The U.S.,
though, is agreeable to eliminating all export controls on
certain cellular communications systems and satellite ground
stations, the White House said.
   The reaction of U.S. industry groups was mixed, though.
Richard Iverson, president of the American Electronics
Association, called the core-list proposal "terrific" because
it signifies the administration's intention to catch up with
rapidly changing events in Europe. But he also said that the
administration should have gone further in easing controls on
computers and added digital switching equipment to the list
of unrestricted products.
   John Pickitt, president of the Computer and Business
Machines Manufacturers Association, said he hopes there is
"negotiating room" in the U.S. proposal so that some
refinements can be made at the Cocom meetings.
   U.S. officials insist that the White House proposal is
generous concerning computers since it would eliminate
controls on most personal computers using Intel Corp.'s 80386
microprocessor, which represents mid-1980s technology. These
models, which are among the most widely used in the
noncommunist world, include IBM's AS 400, Control Data's
Cyber 840 and Hewlett Packard Co.'s 3000, Commerce Department
officials said.
   Apple Computer Inc., the Cupertino, Calif., personal
computer manufacturer, said that the proposals, if accepted,
would open for Eastern bloc distribution its entire Macintosh
PC line. Such a move wouldn't endanger national security, an
Apple spokeswoman said, who added that the company recently
began evaluating Eastern European markets on a
country-by-country basis. It's still too early to say how the
company would sell and distribute its PCs there, given the
different currencies and the lack of distribution systems,
the spokeswoman said.
   State Department officials said the White House
announcement reflects the work of many agencies, including
the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency. The
Pentagon previously resisted significant changes in the Cocom
list, but Defense Secretary Richard Cheney finally consented
to the proposal, a senior Pentagon aide said.
   The U.S. also proposes to remove restrictions on
numerically controlled machine tools with an accuracy as
close as two to three microns; a micron equals one thousandth
of a millimeter. Under the current rules, Cocom countries
can't ship to the Soviet Union machine tools with a precision
of less than 10 microns.
   The proposed changes are likely to benefit U.S. vendors
most in the computer field and Western European suppliers
most in machine tools. U.S. and Western European companies
are in toe-to-toe competition for telecommunications
equipment sales in Eastern Europe.
   The U.S. will also urge Cocom to give favorable licensing
treatment to Eastern European countries that adopt
Cocom-approved safeguards against the reshipment of
controlled goods to unauthorized users. A Pentagon official
said these safeguards could include on-site verification, the
passage of export-control laws, and some degree of
"intelligence-sharing" with Cocom suppliers.
