   Separately, James F. Hankinson, 46 years old, was named
president and chief operating officer and elected to the
board of this transportation, resources, telecommunications
and real estate concern. He was executive vice president. The
chief operating officer post is new. As president, Mr.
Hankinson succeeds William W. Stinson, 56, who remains
chairman and chief executive. Also elected to the board was
consultant Dian Cohen, 57. The newly elected directors fill
vacancies.
   Net fell to 76.2 million Canadian dollars (US$65.4
million), or 24 Canadian cents (21 U.S. cents) a share, from
C$134.1 million, or 42 Canadian cents a share, a year
earlier. Year-earlier figures include profit from
discontinued operations of C$2.7 million, or one Canadian
cent a share. Revenue fell to C$2.59 billion from C$2.62
billion.
   Mr. Stinson told the annual meeting that first-quarter
results "are far from satisfactory," adding that "earnings
this year will be significantly below those of 1989." He
didn't elaborate.
   Holders approved a shareholder rights plan, with 58% of
votes cast in favor of the plan. In a separate ballot,
holders approved the distribution of 80% of Canadian
Pacific's interest in its Marathon Realty Co. subsidiary,
with 90.2% of votes cast in favor of the proposal. Shares in
Marathon, a Toronto-based real estate concern, will be
distributed to holders on the basis of one Marathon share for
every four Canadian Pacific shares held. Canadian Pacific
retains a 20% interest in Marathon, which will be listed on
the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Canadian Pacific rose 12.5 cents a share to $18.
