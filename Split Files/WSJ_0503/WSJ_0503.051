   NEW YORK -- A state court judge denied a motion by three
investment firms to dismiss a lawsuit filed by West Virginia,
accusing them of partial responsibility for losses on the
state's investments.
   In October, the state filed suit in West Virginia,
accusing five brokerage firms with responsibility for much of
large losses arising in West Virginia's consolidated
investment pool. The firms, Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. unit, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Greenwich
Capital Markets, and subsidiaries of Salomon Inc. and
National Westminster Bank PLC, processed investments for the
state.

   Greenwich and the NatWest subsidiary since have settled
with the state. Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley and
Goldman asked a judge in state Supreme Court, a trial court,
in Manhattan to declare that the firms hadn't any liability
in the case or to declare that the case should be heard here.
   In an opinion, Justice Harold Baer here declined to
absolve the firms and he said the case should be heard in
West Virginia. The U.S. District Court in Charleston, W.Va.,
now is weighing whether it or a West Virginia state court
should hear the case.
   Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A
spokesman for Salomon couldn't be reached for comment.
