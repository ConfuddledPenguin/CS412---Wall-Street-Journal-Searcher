   BOEING Co. (Seattle) -- Boyd E. Givan, 54 years old, was
named chief financial officer of this aerospace concern. He
succeeds Harold W. Haynes, 67, who retired last month. Mr.
Givan had been vice president, financial operations and
treasurer before being named senior vice president several
weeks ago as part of a planned transition. He retains that
title in addition to the chief financial officer designation.
