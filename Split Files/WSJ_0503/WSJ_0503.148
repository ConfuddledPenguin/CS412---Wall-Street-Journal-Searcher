   For a few years, Sean Marsee's story seemed powerful
enough to devastate the smokeless tobacco industry.
   The Oklahoma youth started using Copenhagen brand snuff at
age 13, after receiving a free sample at a rodeo. Six years
later, he died of oral cancer, and his family filed a $147
million product-liability suit against UST Inc., maker of
Copenhagen. The 1986 case prompted a barrage of media
coverage and spotlighted public attention on the dangers of
smokeless.

   But today, the snuff business is booming. While sales of
cigarettes continue to decline, consumption of moist snuff
jumped 4.6% last year, according to John C. Maxwell Jr. of
Wheat First Securities Inc. UST, which dominates the
industry, is even trying to capitalize on the growing
anti-smoking movement with a new product called Select that
is advertised as an alternative to cigarettes.
   That's setting off alarms among public health officials
and anti-tobacco groups, who believe snuff products, and the
macho marketing pitches used to hawk them, hold an especially
strong appeal for young people. "Kids start dipping at an
earlier age than smoking," says Elbert D. Glover, director of
the Center for Tobacco Research at Pennsylvania State
University. "We're finding kids in elementary school using
smokeless."
   Tobacco marketers adamantly deny targeting children,
maintaining they are seeking only adult consumers of other
tobacco products. Regardless of that intent, some industry
insiders concede the products are especially popular among
youngsters. "Kids like it because it gives them a nicotine
buzz you don't get from cigarettes," says Tracy Axton Jr.,
chairman of Axton Candy &amp; Tobacco Co., a Louisville, Ky.,
distributor. Adds another southern tobacco distributor:
"Snuff appeals mainly to younger and athletic kids, 14 or 15
years old."
   Perhaps because of its controversial nature, the
industry's vigor is all the more striking. In the mid-1980s,
the far-reaching publicity about the Marsee case galvanized
consumers and government regulators against smokeless
tobacco, which is used by as much as 6% of the population. In
a 1986 report, the surgeon general cautioned that smokeless
tobacco users run a higher risk of developing oral cancer and
other dental problems, and that smokeless products can lead
to nicotine dependence.
   Marketers were required to add one of three warning labels
to products, including "This product may cause mouth cancer."
Broadcast advertising was halted. Manufacturers also
voluntarily agreed to stop using professional athletes to
endorse products and have curtailed product sampling on
college campuses. Since then, Minnesota, Utah and Nebraska
have banned sampling of tobacco products altogether, and now
the Federal Trade Commission is preparing to enforce the use
of warning labels on such promotional items as caps and golf
balls.
   Remarkably, UST, which controls 85% of the $800 million
market for moist snuff, has emerged from the fracas
unscathed. The company won the Marsee case in 1989, after an
appeals court upheld a lower court verdict. Despite the
negative press, the company's tobacco operating profits have
marched steadily upward. Last year, the Greenwich, Conn.,
company's net margin neared 28%, making it one of the
nation's most profitable industrial companies -- and more
than three times as profitable as Philip Morris Cos.
   UST's tobacco unit makes mostly moist snuff products --
cured, finely ground tobacco packed in tins -- under the
brands Copenhagen and Skoal. A pinch or "dip" of snuff
between users' upper lip and gum gives a jolt of nicotine
that lasts about 30 minutes. Favored by young consumers over
other smokeless products such as chewing tobacco, moist snuff
is the only growing niche of the tobacco industry. Chewing
tobacco, made of bigger pieces of tobacco, makes for a
milder, though sloppier, experience.
   The recovery of smokeless is a result, in part, of
aggressive marketing tactics honed by UST. At a time when
marketers of liquor and tobacco have come under increasing
pressure for target marketing, UST has quietly continued the
strategy. That's been possible because few of its customers
are professionals, and most of its low-profile marketing
efforts take place outside media centers. The company targets
mostly white, blue-collar males who work in factories or on
farms, or in such industries as lumber, steel and energy.
   To reach that audience, UST does little print advertising.
Instead, it and other smokeless tobacco makers have learned
to fish where the fishing is good. They spend millions to
sponsor such events as auto racing, rodeos, monster truck
shows and tractor pulls, where their blue-collar customers
are likely to gather. "The motor sports and fishing people
love these companies," says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special
Events Report, a Chicago newsletter.
   To reach into rural areas where few big sporting events
occur, Pinkerton Tobacco Co., the Richmond, Va.-based maker
of Red Man chewing tobacco, has even acted as a promoter to
organize country western concerts. That allows Pinkerton to
bring local artists to small towns that most promoters would
overlook. To grab a bigger piece of the faster-growing moist
snuff market, Pinkerton is in the process of rolling out a
new moist snuff product under its Red Man brand.
   UST also has been adroit at developing a steady stream of
new products to keep consumers dipping. The company
revolutionized the industry in 1983, with its introduction of
Skoal Bandits, snuff packaged in pouches that look like tiny
tea bags. UST is now testing its Select brand, which is also
in pre-measured pouches, in four markets. The milder product
comes in what looks like a cigarette package, rather than in
the traditional tin. Ads for Select aim to lure puffers by
commiserating that "Just when you'd love to have a smoke, you
find you're in a place where you can't."
   What's more, the industry giant has an enormous sales
force it can unleash for product sampling at special events
-- a key strategy for introducing new products since the ban
on broadcast advertising. Bill Melton, a marketing consultant
and a former executive at Pinkerton, figures UST's sales
force at about 400, as large as its two nearest competitors
combined, Conwood Co. and Pinkerton. "They hire people who
actually use the product," says another tobacco distributor.
   But public health officials worry that the tobacco
marketers have been so successful in crafting a macho aura
for their brands, that dipping has virtually become a right
of passage for boys in rural areas. "Dipping is seen as a
manly thing to do, and boys are experimenting with what it's
like to be a man," says Herb Severson, a research scientist
at the Oregon Research Institute. Mr. Severson, a
psychologist involved in smoking prevention, says junior high
kids in Oregon use smokeless tobacco at a higher rate than
cigarettes.
   Critics also say the frequent presence of snuff tins in
the back pockets of professional baseball players serves to
increase the product's appeal in the eyes of children. Free
sampling programs to major league and minor league teams have
been in place since the 1950s, though about one-third of all
professional teams have banished free samples from their
clubhouses. Still, about 34% of the players use some form of
smokeless tobacco regularly, according to a 1988 study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Despite the fact that his team has banned free samples of
smokeless tobacco, usage seems to be increasing, according to
Ron McClain, the trainer at the Montreal Expos. "The older
players do it, and the younger players coming up see them do
it, and then they start."
   Still, manufacturers claim they are doing what they can to
prevent the products from falling into the hands of children.
The Smokeless Tobacco Council Inc., a trade group, has urged
tobacco retailers to limit sales to consumers over 18. So
far, 43 states have established a minimum age for purchasing
smokeless tobacco, though in some states the legal age is
only 16.
   UST maintains that it focuses its marketing effort only on
adult males who already use some form of tobacco. "Smokeless
tobacco is an adult product," says a UST spokesman. "We
adhere to a strict code that prohibits us from advertising
and marketing efforts that appeal to youth."
   Bob Seidensticker, chairman of Pinkerton, says his company
takes pains never to hand out product samples to children at
events, and doesn't send any tobacco products through the
mail. "Every single sample clearly states the product is for
consumers over 18," he says. "We're acting in a very
responsible way."
