   Eastman Kodak Co., showing the benefits of extensive cost
cutting, recorded a 6% drop in first-quarter net income,
better than analysts expected.
   Net fell to $199 million, or 61 cents a share, from $212
million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell to
$4.11 billion from $4.21 billion.

   The Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic, chemical and
pharmaceutical concern said it restated 1989 results to
reflect the company's conversion to a calendar year. Kodak's
fiscal year began Dec. 26, and its quarters weren't uniform.
The change increased 1989 first-quarter net three cents a
share.
   In Kodak's core photographic products division, domestic
sales fell 15%, but lower costs and higher film prices helped
boost operating earnings 50% to $219 million. Colby H.
Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer, who retires
this month, cautioned that the rate of earnings increase in
this division will moderate in the coming months.
   Mr. Chandler said, "Barring unexpected developments in the
economy, we believe the recovery forecast for Kodak will come
about and that this will become increasingly clear in
subsequent quarters."
   Kodak's results exceeded most analysts' expectations of 50
to 55 cents a share, but analysts said it's uncertain how
much the improvement in photographic products comes from
one-time cost-cutting benefits derived from a restructuring
program announced last year, as opposed to fundamental
improvements in operations.
   Yet, despite the better-than-expected results, some
analysts expressed disappointment with the 3.5% decline in
operating profit, as earnings fell in Kodak's
information-system, chemical and health divisions.
   "Even though the company's on track in terms of Wall
Street's earnings expectations, how can you be excited if
chemical profits are off 38% and information systems is off
20%?" asked David Nelson, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton. "That's not the stuff you write home about."
