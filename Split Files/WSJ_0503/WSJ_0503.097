   STEVEN R. ROSENTHAL, a 33-year-old insurance-agency scion,
is showing a small group of youngsters from the slums of New
Orleans a way out.
   "Eagles" is the name Mr. Rosenthal gives his
elementary-school-age charges, reflecting his hope that
someday they, too, will soar. Right now, all he asks is that
they apply themselves, staying in school through high-school
graduation. Those who succeed, and gain admission to a
college or vocational school, will get a $1,000 annual
scholarship from a trust funded by Mr. Rosenthal. In
addition, throughout their public-school years in the
program, the Eagles will be treated to special trips and
other extracurricular educational activities, all paid for by
Mr. Rosenthal.
   The program began four years ago, sparked by an idea Mr.
Rosenthal got while doing volunteer education work in New
Orleans public schools. "I know it sounds corny but I wanted
to make a difference," he says.
   Five second-grade students from New Orleans's Laurel
elementary school were the first Laurel Eagles. Since then,
13 more youngsters have been added; by year end, he will have
signed up 21 third-through-sixth graders.
   The candidates are selected from a list put together by
Laurel teachers. Children from neighboring housing projects
have an edge; after that, Mr. Rosenthal looks for
"spunkiness" even more than grades. The willingness of
parents -- only three Eagles have two parents at home -- to
help also is taken into account.
   The first year is a trial period. If the child and parent
pass muster, Mr. Rosenthal signs a simple, one-page contract
with a parent. After completing the sixth grade, the child
also becomes a formal party to the pact, which in part
requires the child to "promise to work hard in school and to
maintain good grades."
   The early signs are encouraging. Four Eagles recently won
transfers to "magnet" schools, which draw the better students
regardless of school district. At the magnet Robert M. Lusher
School, Eagle Lawanda Page won the annual spelling bee. She
and her mother had worked a month memorizing all 2,000 words
in the contest.
   Expectations also are being raised. "After we get to know
each other, about half of the kids want to be insurance
agents when they grow up," says Mr. Rosenthal, a graduate of
Amherst College and the Wharton School and a vice president
and part owner of the Rosenthal Agency. (His father founded
the agency 25 years ago; current annual billings are about
$25 million.)
   There have been setbacks. One 11-year-old left the program
after her mother was murdered, and another dropped out after
her mother stopped attending parent meetings.
   Although the program takes much of Mr. Rosenthal's free
time, its annual net cost -- excluding the scholarship
funding -- is only about $200 for each Eagle, or $4,000
total. That's less than the private-school tuition for Mr.
Rosenthal's seven-year-old daughter.
   To fund the future college scholarships, Mr. Rosenthal
will contribute to a tax-free corporation every year sums
ranging from $100 a student for those completing sixth grade
to $1,500 a student for those in 12th grade.
   "The Laurel Eagles are No. 3 priority to Steve after his
own family and his job," says his sister, Leslie Jacobs.
