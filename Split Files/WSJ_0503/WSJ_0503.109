   Banque Paribas said group profit rose 19% in 1989, helped
by a decline in new provisions for loan risks.
   The bank unit of Cie. Financiere de Paribas said group
earnings after payments to minority interests climbed to 1.38
billion francs ($244.3 million) for the year from 1.16
billion francs in 1988.

   Banque Paribas noted that its 1989 performance was marked
by narrower margins on loan activity, following an inversion
of the yield curve in France. It also said that profit from
capital market operations was weaker than in previous years,
without elaborating. Banque Paribas said merchant banking and
fund management grew significantly in 1989, however.
   The combination of these elements left operating profit
before income taxes and provisions at 3.66 billion francs,
down from 4.48 billion francs a year earlier. This erosion
was offset by a decline in new loan provisions to 1.34
billion francs from 2.5 billion francs in 1988. Paribas noted
that the lower provisions reflected an improvement in the
quality of its loan portfolio.
