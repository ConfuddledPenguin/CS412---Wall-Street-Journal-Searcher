   Kudos on editorially deboning the "Mean Greens" at Rolling
Stone for their bland hypocrisy-pontificating about the
environment while promoting the production of virtually
non-biodegradable CDs, LPs and cassettes ("Are CDs
Recyclable?" April 18).
   Your editorial, however, revealed just the tip of the
iceberg. In the throes of their ecohysteria, Hollywoodites
and the music industry ignore not only their contribution to
the solid-waste crisis (not to mention noise pollution), but
also their own willynilly squandering of our precious natural
resources.

   For instance, how many million kilowatts of energy are
wasted annually to overamplify today's deafeningly loud rock
concerts? Ecologically sensitive balladeers should be blazing
a trail for the rest of us by going acoustic, instead of
wailing through 30-foot speakers about rain forests and the
horrors of nuclear power.
   And speaking of nuclear power, how many entertainers check
out the source of their juice before plugging in and cranking
up? Atomic fission has undoubtedly powered performances by
thousands of unsuspecting artistes.
   Finally, how much electricity was wasted on public-address
systems to exhort the faithful at Earth Day rallies?
   Like the Sierra Club, which prints its calendars on
unrecyclable paper, Rolling Stone and the rest of the
glitterati have found in environmentalism a cause du jour
that is painless to preach but much more difficult to
practice.

   Congratulations for doing battle with the zealots of
environmentalism. By the time I finished reading your
editorial on Earth Day ("O Holy Day," April 19), I was
determined to lend my hand and join the iconoclasts. What
could I do? Then I spied the enemy's major icon. Without any
hesitation I smashed my six-year-old's globe. Hah]
   What next? My gaze fell upon the week's accumulation of
The Wall Street Journal. No problem there -- but then my
iconoclasm blossomed in full. Why stop with the granolas?
There in front of me were the scriptures of another
neo-religion run amok. A quick glance assured me that the
priests and priestesses were busy at work uplifting the
masses to new heights of well-being. Their sermons rolled
down from the pulpit: to produce more is good; to consume
more is better; to ignore all other purpose of existence is
best; unfettered and unquestioned economic growth is the
sacrament.
   There are zealots of just about every persuasion. The Club
of Rome was as wrong as the atomic-energy visionaries of the
1950s. Thankfully, being wrong is not a proscription for
speaking out on issues or the Earth would be a very quiet
place.
   You are quite right that there is a religious-like
atmosphere to this issue. The debate is about more than clean
air and GNP. It extends to the core questions of how and why
we live.

   Everything has its downside, and Earth Day is no
exception. I am appalled at what well-meaning environmental
alarmists are doing to our children. The environmental
problems, and possible solutions to those problems, easily
boggle the mind of the most knowledgeable, concerned adult.
For example, I have read numerous, convincing predictions
that the Earth will perish because it's going to get hotter
and equally convincing ones proving that we're headed for
another ice age. To little children, these issues are only
terrifying fairy stories.
   Thanks to a relentless barrage of doomsday predictions,
children now believe that the entire world is a hopeless
mess. That careless, greedy adults have irrevocably tipped
the "delicate balance of Nature" toward destruction.
   These unremitting, gloomy messages hit our kids from all
sides -- in school and at home over the airwaves. Every
nature show on TV must now whipsaw kids by first glorifying
and romanticizing Nature and then predicting that adults are
on the verge of ruining everything the children have just
seen.
   Adults just can't seem to resist inflicting their fears
and ideology on children. It's sickening. As Pink Floyd sang,
"Leave them kids alone]"
