   Hoechst AG said its first-quarter group pretax profit fell
8.5% to 920 million marks ($547.6 million), while sales
increased 5% to 11.03 billion marks.
   The West German chemical company said that even though
pretax profit fell, it still expects to post profit for all
of 1990 similar to that posted for 1989.

<TEXT>
   Hoechst had profit of 2.13 billion marks in 1989 on 45.9
billion marks in sales.
   In the current year, the company financial performance has
been "handicapped" by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and
downward pressure on prices, the company said.
   However it said that it managed to have "a good volume
development" in Western Europe.
