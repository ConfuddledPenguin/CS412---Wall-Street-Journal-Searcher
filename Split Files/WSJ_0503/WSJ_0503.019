   To Motorola's Phone

   IT'S A GAME of one-upmanship for makers of pocket phones.
   A year ago, Motorola Inc. scored a technological coup over
Japanese and European rivals with its MicroTac, a cellular
phone that fits easily into a pocket. Now, in trying to do
more than merely catch up, competitors are altering the tiny
circuitry in these phones to extend battery life between
recharges. By reducing power consumption, two rival phone
makers have prolonged battery life and doubled the 30-minute
talking limit MicroTac offers with its standard battery.
   NEC Corp.'s Mobile Radio Division is pushing the P-300,
which offers 80 minutes of talk time. NEC finagled the extra
minutes through a 30% reduction in power-hungry circuitry.
   Engineers at L.M. Ericsson have designed a pocket phone
with larger, more efficient filters in its transceiver to cut
power drain. This summer, Ericsson GE Mobile Communications
Inc., a Lynchburg, Va., joint venture between the Swedish
telecommunications giant and General Electric Co., plans to
begin selling the unit, called Hotline, in the U.S. Although
an inch longer than MicroTac, the Hotline is already a big
seller in Scandinavia, according to Ericsson and GE.
   Ericsson-GE isn't stopping there. In a move that surprises
industry watchers, the venture also says it will have a
digital phone the size of Hotline within a couple of years.
Digital phones are considered the phones of the future
because they are more efficient, but it's generally assumed
that the first digital phones, which must also work with the
current analog transmission networks, won't be very small.
   Ours will be, Ericsson-GE says. "A large phone will have a
hard time finding a market," says Fleming Orneholm, vice
president of Ericsson Radio Systems. "We will fight Motorola
to the line."
   Motorola declined to comment on its competitors.
                                                                                                       

   New Kind of Disk Aims
   For a Hit on the Radio
                                                                                                       

   RADIO STATIONS may be able to quit fumbling with bulky
audio tapes for commercials.
   Computer Concepts Corp. has designed a personal
computer-based system that stores up to 340 minutes of audio
program on a single computer hard disk. The Lenexa, Kan.,
company says the system allows stations to cue up crisper,
clearer jingles and other radio fare without the bother of
myriad, separate tape cartridges.
   Key to the system's operation is a computer board that
plugs into a PC and attaches to the broadcaster's audio
equipment. Electronic chips on the board convert a tape's
analog audio sound to digital and store it on the disk. Each
program is also cataloged according to its play time and
schedule for airing. An operator at the PC can then retrieve
what he wants and, by pushing a button, put it on the air.
   "Today, a radio station has three or four tape players
that can get dirty and muddy the sound," says company
President Greg Dean. "This is CD-quality sound, only it's on
a computer rather than laser disk."
   It costs about $22,000 to equip a production studio and
control studio, and the staff would require totally new
training. Still, radio stations have tested the system with
good results and about a dozen have put in orders.
                                                                                                       

   A Computer Uses an Eye
   For Its Hearing Aid
                                                                                                       

   GEORGE BUSH, a computer may accept your challenge.
   Ben P. Yuhas, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins
University, is training a computer to read lips. Mr. Yuhas,
who works in the school's electrical and computer engineering
department's speech-processing lab, says people unconsciously
lip-read to augment their hearing when conversing in a noisy
place. He figures a speech-recognition computer with the same
lip-reading ability could operate better on a factory floor
or in other noisy spots.
   Rather than use a conventional computer, which operates
solely on a program, Mr. Yuhas is using a "neural network"
system that learns how to solve problems by mimicking the
thought processes of the brain. Mr. Yuhas videotaped a man's
mouth forming vowel sounds and fed the information into the
neural computer. When this visual reference was combined with
acoustic patterns of speech, the recognition system was able
to overcome its difficulty with background noise.
   When could all the video and other components from Mr.
Yuhas's research be combined into a commercially applicable
system? Read his lips: Not until after the next election.
                                                                                                       

   High-Tech Sherlock
   Tracks Down the Beep
                                                                                                       

   COMPUTER CROOKS beware: Identifax Computer Recovery
Bureau, Setauket, N.Y., is offering a security registry that
helps police trace stolen personal and laptop computers.
   The system uses software called COP (Computer Owner
Protection), which lets the owner program a special
identifying beep that sounds when the computer is turned on.
When the police come across a machine they suspect is stolen,
they can call Identifax, hold a phone next to the computer as
it is turned on, and Identifax's central data bank will
identify the beep and the computer's owner.
   "We're hitting the education market first since they're
the ones that get hit the most," says Warner Loeb, Identifax
president. The company has already equipped the State
University of New York at Stony Brook with COP and has a
contract to register computers at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in New York.
