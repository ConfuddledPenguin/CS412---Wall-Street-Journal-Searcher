   WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady expressed
mild concern over the rise in the value of the dollar against
the yen, saying it "certainly doesn't help" U.S. efforts to
narrow the country's massive trade deficit with Japan.
   Mr. Brady said he doesn't know whether the dollar's recent
strength against the Japanese currency will hurt U.S. exports
seriously, but he added: "it's something you do worry about."

   Speaking at a United States Information Agency conference,
Mr. Brady said he was pleased by the way the world financial
markets have weathered the recent plunge in the Japanese
stock market.
   "When you get that huge an adjustment in an individual
country, you worry it's going to ripple out and produce
dislocation all over the world," he said. "The truth is the
system has worked very well.
   Although the yen has fallen, he said, "the very, very good
news is we've had stability while we've had an enormous
sell-off in the Japanese market."
