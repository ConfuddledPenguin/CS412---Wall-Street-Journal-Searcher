   WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- Commodore International Ltd. said
heavy marketing efforts essentially wiped out profit during
its fiscal third quarter. Still, the battered personal
computer maker showed some signs of life.
   Commodore reported a profit of $200,000, or one cent a
share, in its fiscal 1990 third period, which ended March 31.
That's a 98% drop from a $12.4 million profit, or 38 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. Sales eked out a 1.4%
gain, rising to $213.2 million from $210.2 million.

   Most of the decline in profit was due to "substantial
marketing investments" in the company's stronghold market,
Europe, which drove up operating expenses 28%, to $62.5
million from $48.8 million, Commodore said.
   But the company noted that sales of its Amiga computer and
a group of machines compatible with International Business
Machines Corp.'s PC-AT computer increased "substantially"
during the period, more than offsetting a decline in the
ancient Commodore 64 family. Indeed, Commodore said the Amiga
accounted for almost 55% of its sales during the period. That
number should rise again during the coming months, as
Commodore rolls out the Amiga 3000, a much-hyped machine
aimed at the growing "multimedia" market.
   "There's some reason for optimism," said Charles Frumberg,
an analyst with Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. in New York. "My sense is
that things are turning up." But Mr. Frumberg added that
"it's clear that the ball won't be going over the fence in
fiscal 1990."
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1990, Commodore said
profit fell 92% to $5 million, or 16 cents a share, from
$60.2 million, or $1.88 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales dropped 9% to $689.2 million from $759.4 million.
