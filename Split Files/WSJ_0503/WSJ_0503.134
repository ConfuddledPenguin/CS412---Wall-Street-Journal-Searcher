   NEW YORK -- A federal appeals court, reversing the
conviction of former stockbroker Robert Chestman, set limits
on who can be prosecuted in insider-trading cases.
   As part of the decision, the appeals-court panel also
gutted a Securities Exchange Act regulation that is widely
used in insider-trading cases. That regulation, known as Rule
14e-3, makes it a crime to trade on misappropriated
information involving a tender offer -- even if the defendant
isn't violating a fiduciary duty by making the trade. The
Securities and Exchange Commission commonly relies on Rule
14e-3 in insider-trading cases against defendants who aren't
company insiders.

   "This decision seems to seriously emasculate Rule 14e-3,"
said Harvey Pitt, a defense attorney in Washington, and a
former SEC general counsel. He said Rule 14e-3 has been "the
principal weapon, since its adoption in 1980, in
insider-trading cases involving takeovers."
   The rule has been used in a wide range of SEC lawsuits,
including the original case against Michael Milken. The SEC
also has alleged 14e-3 violations in its suits against Andrew
Solomon, a former research analyst with the broker-dealer
firm Marcus Schloss & Co.; Ronald Yagoda, formerly a senior
official at Marcus Schloss; and Giuseppe Tome, an investment
banker accused of insider trading in St. Joe Minerals Corp.
stock. Mr. Solomon and Mr. Yagoda settled with the SEC, and a
federal judge ordered Mr. Tome to pay back his
insider-trading profits.
   The three-judge panel of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of
Appeals unanimously reversed Mr. Chestman's conviction, and
ordered his release from prison. But it was divided 2-1 in
rejecting Rule 14e-3.
   Richard Kirby, senior litigation counsel for the SEC, said
that if the decision stands, the SEC will be prohibited from
making 14e-3 charges in the Second Circuit, which includes
New York. Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Gilbert said the
government is reviewing its options for appealing the case.
   Mr. Chestman, formerly a broker with Gruntal &amp; Co., was
found guilty in March 1989 of 31 counts related to alleged
insider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock. But the trading was
based on information that Mr. Chestman received fourth-hand,
making him what is known as a "remote tippee." The court
reversed the conviction on the ground that Mr. Chestman
hadn't been told that the information was confidential.
   The case, which was seen as an attempt to expand the scope
of who can can be prosecuted for insider trading, involved
Mr. Chestman's trading in Waldbaum stock in 1986 before the
company's takeover by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. Mr.
Chestman claimed that the information that prompted him to
buy the stock wasn't inside information because it came from
a distant relative of Waldbaum's then-president.
   Mr. Chestman wasn't told that the information was
confidential, and no assurances were made that the
information would be kept secret as it was passed along on
its way to Mr. Chestman, the appeals court said.
   "There can be no misappropriation of information by one
who is unaware of the confidentiality of that information,"
the appeals court said in its decision. "After passing
through several family channels, it cannot be said that the
information was confidential to any degree or was any more
than `family gossip.'"
   Mr. Chestman was expected to be released last night from
the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania. He
voluntarily began serving his two-year sentence last June
while his appeal was pending.
   Elkan Abramowitz, Mr. Chestman's attorney, said the
appeals court's decision "should put restraints on the
government. . . . I think they will have to think twice now
when they bring a misappropriation case {for alleged insider
trading} when there is no breach of fiduciary duty."
   John C. Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, said
the decision's "significance is to limit the expansion of the
misappropriation theory. Under this decision, it can only be
applied when the government can make a showing that the
defendant knew the information was stolen."
   Theodore Levine, an attorney in Washington, said the
appeals court decision illustrates "the clear need for the
government to define what insider trading is."
   Mr. Pitt, who represented stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky
in his insider trading-related plea bargain in 1986, helped
draft proposed legislation on insider trading in 1987. He
said the court decision could spur the renewal of such
congressional efforts. "It's much better for people to know
what the rules are in advance of the activity," he said.
   Mr. Pitt added that under the 1987 proposal, which was not
adopted by Congress, Mr. Chestman's conduct would have been
prohibited.
   The SEC believes Rule 14e-3 is well within the
commission's rule-making authority, said Mr. Kirby, the SEC's
senior litigation counsel. He said the rule was adopted to do
just what the divided court decision has declared invalid --
to go after alleged insider traders who don't have a
fiduciary duty not to use the information.
   "The commission had the power under the statutes to
provide a rule that didn't require proof of a breach of
fiduciary duty" in insider-trading cases, he said.
   Mr. Kirby said the commission will immediately begin
reviewing the appeals court decision. He said that, in
addition to considering an appeal, the commission could turn
to Congress and ask that the SEC regulation be adopted as
law.
   Mr. Abramowitz said he is reviewing Mr. Chestman's
settlement of SEC civil charges in the case to see whether
the agreement can be revised in light of the appeals court
decision. In that settlement, reached in January, Mr.
Chestman was barred from the securities industry and agreed
to pay $235,125 in profits allegedly made through insider
trading. Mr. Chestman consented to the settlement without
admitting or denying guilt.
