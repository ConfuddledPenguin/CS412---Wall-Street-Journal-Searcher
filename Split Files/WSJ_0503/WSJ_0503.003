   Studies of the brain of a young suicide who carried the
gene for Huntington's disease are providing a glimmer of hope
that treatments can be developed for the deadly brain
disorder.
   Based on the discovery and some previous findings,
researchers are beginning to test several prototype drugs on
patients with the disease. Doctors caution that the tests are
in preliminary stages and that they are uncertain about the
drugs' effects.

   Still, "the new research suggests a (treatment) strategy,
and that's very important," said Susan Folstein, a
Huntington's disease researcher at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
   Huntington's is an inherited disease, often called a
genetic time-bomb because its symptoms -- a degeneration of
physical and mental control -- don't explode until a person
is nearing middle age. The disease, invariably fatal, affects
only about 25,000 Americans, but another 125,000 are thought
to carry the gene that causes it. Everyone who inherits the
gene is destined to develop the disease.
   While scientists know the disease is caused by a single
defective gene passed from parent to child, they have yet to
find the gene. And they don't yet know how it wreaks havoc on
the body. But in a report published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, researchers at the University of
Michigan said they have traced a trail of destruction to
certain nerve cells in the brain of a young woman who carried
the gene but had yet to develop symptoms.
   "The study is a capstone for a series of recent studies
suggesting a pathway through which the gene damages the
brain," said Roger Albin, a neurologist at the University of
Michigan. "It's a provocative finding."
   For several years, Dr. Albin and his colleagues, and
researchers elsewhere, have been studying the brains of
people who died from Huntington's disease. The scientists
found that nerve cells related to a chemical called
enkephalin, which transmits messages among brain cells, are
destroyed. But they weren't certain if nerve cell destruction
was the cause or just one of the effects of the disease.
   To solve the riddle, scientists needed to analyze the
brain of someone who carried the gene but hadn't yet
developed the disease and thus might provide a clue about
whether the nerve damage was occurring before the disease.
But until the early 1980s, scientists had no way of knowing
who carried the gene and who didn't. Then in 1983 scientists
used new DNA technology to pinpoint a genetic "marker" that
was physically close to the Huntington's disease gene. A test
that detects the marker can determine whether a person has
inherited Huntington's disease.
   The test has become controversial because it can predict
who will develop the disease yet there is no treatment to
offer people who learn of their fate. Thus, researchers are
under great pressure to find some type of therapy for the
disease.
   The Michigan researchers were sent the brain of a 31-year
old woman who had suffered bouts of severe depression, willed
her brain to research and subsequently committed suicide.
When the scientists examined the brain, they were startled to
see early signs of the kind of cell damage usually seen in
older Huntington's disease victims. Tracing back, they found
that the woman had relatives with Huntington's disease.
   The woman had also had a specimen of her blood stored
before she died. Using the new gene detection test, the
Michigan researchers found evidence in the blood that the
woman had carried the Huntington's disease gene and,
therefore, had been destined eventually to develop the
disease.
   The scientists found that the woman's brain was missing
normal amounts of a "receptor" on nerve cells that receives
certain chemical messages. The receptor, called NMDA, is also
thought to be the target of toxic proteins released by the
brain following a stroke or other trauma. Dr. Folstein at
Johns Hopkins said the Michigan report and other research
strongly suggest that an NMDA-protecting drug could prevent
the nerve damage associated with the disease. Several drug
research teams, including one at Merck &amp; Co., are testing
drugs that can protect the NMDA receptor from the destructive
proteins.
   Dr. Folstein said she and others are now testing
experimental drugs that appear to block the toxic proteins.
"The trick is to develop drugs that selectively affect only
those NMDA receptors involved in Huntington's disease, and
not the other receptors located throughout the brain," Dr.
Folstein said. Scientists racing to find the Huntington's
disease gene hope that it will provide the final clue,
helping to identify the specific NMDA receptors.
