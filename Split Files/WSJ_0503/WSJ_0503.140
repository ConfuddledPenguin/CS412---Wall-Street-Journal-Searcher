   Ames Department Stores Inc. said it received U.S.
bankruptcy court clearance to receive $25 million in
financing, enabling the discount retailer to purchase badly
needed merchandise for its some 600 stores.
   The loan is part of $250 million in financing Ames
negotiated with Chemical Bank, pending court approval. A May
8 hearing in U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan has been
scheduled to determine if more funds should be released.

   Judge Howard C. Buschman approved the initial $25 million
after Ames disclosed in court that it expects to collect
$268.4 million, including sales receipts, through May 19, but
will need $314 million to buy goods and operate the stores in
that period.
   Some of the merchandise will be purchased to make good on
rainchecks issued last week after Ames shoppers discovered
that the stores lacked many of the toys, housewares, toiletry
and clothing items featured in its April 29 circular. Ames
subsequently took out ads in local newspapers apologizing for
the missing goods.
   Ames filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last week, after negotiations
with its lenders stalled and many of its suppliers stopped
shipments. The filing followed an announcement that the
retailer expects to post a $228 million loss for the year
ended Jan. 27. The loss includes a charge of $150 million
taken to close 74 of its unprofitable stores. All but two are
part the 389 Zayre store chain Ames acquired for $778 million
in November 1988.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ames closed at
$2.875 a share, up 37.5 cents.
   Separately, a Chicago investor filed a lawsuit against
Ames directors, alleging that the company issued misleading
statements regarding its financial condition.
   In the suit, filed in federal court in Bridgeport, Conn.,
debenture holder Avers Wexler charged that Ames directors
permitted the firm to sell about $155 million in debentures
without fully disclosing the extent of its financial
difficulties.
   The suit seeks class action status and was filed on behalf
of investors who bought Ames's 7.5% convertible subordinated
debentures from Oct. 5, 1989, to April 9, 1990, the
plaintiff's attorney, Michael J. Freed, said.
   Ames officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
   A preliminary meeting between company representatives,
bondholders and trade creditors has been scheduled for May 10
in New York.
