   Tate &amp; Lyle PLC, Britain's biggest sugar producer,
reported a 25% jump in pretax profit for the six months ended
March 31, helped by good results at both its U.K. and U.S.
operations.
   The company said pretax profit rose to #87.5 million
($143.9 million) from #70.2 million, surpassing market
expectations.

   Profit after tax, less minority interests, jumped 35% to
#50.3 million from #37.2 million. The company reported an
extraordinary gain of #28.8 million from the sales of
businesses completed during the half year. It said profit
attributable to shareholders more than doubled to #79.1
million from #37.2 million. There were no extraordinary items
during the same period a year earlier.
   Sales rose 11% to #1.68 billion from #1.52 billion.
   Tate &amp; Lyle Chairman Neil Shaw said the company is
expecting a continued good performance from all the core
businesses during 1990 "to produce another satisfactory
result for the full year."
