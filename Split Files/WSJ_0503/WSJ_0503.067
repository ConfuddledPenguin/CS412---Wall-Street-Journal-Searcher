   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a
hepatitis C test kit developed by Ortho Diagnostics Systems
Inc., a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   The kit, which is used to detect hepatitis C in blood for
transfusions, includes a biotechnologically derived
recombinant antigen developed by Chiron Corp. of Ermeyville,
Calif. Chiron, whose stock is traded over the counter, has
licensed the product to Ortho.

   The antigen detects the presence of the antibody to
hepatitis C, which is "responsible for the majority of
post-transfusion hepatitis cases," according to an FDA
spokeswoman. There are 170,000 new infections of hepatitis C
each year.
   The FDA is recommending the new screening test to all
blood banks. A spokesman for Ortho said the company will
begin shipping the test kits immediately.
