   WASHINGTON -- President and Mrs. Bush paid an additional
$7,497 in federal taxes after coming across an additional
$26,250 in 1989 income they hadn't reported, the White House
said.
   The additional payment brought the Bushes' total federal
tax bill to $108,879, on total income of $483,030, according
to amended tax forms released by the White House.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the couple's
federal tax return had to be amended to reflect deferred
income, in the form of a paid-up life-insurance policy from
Zapata Off Shore Corp., an oil exploration company Mr. Bush
headed until 1966.
   Mr. Bush became entitled to the policy when he turned 65
years old last year. But the president didn't receive a form
notifying him of the income, and his tax preparer, whose firm
manages Mr. Bush's blind trust, didn't become aware of the
transaction until April 19. The Bushes' original tax return
was filed April 13.
   The discovery caused the couple to lose $525 in itemized
deductions and to pay $40.97 in interest on the extra
payment. But the Bushes shouldn't have to pay a penalty, Mr.
Fitzwater said, because the omission was unintentional, due
to a "reasonable cause," and corrected in a timely fashion.
