   WASHINGTON -- The government's gauge of expected economic
strength rose in March, suggesting the economy will maintain
its recent pattern of mild growth.
   The 0.9% gain in the Commerce Department's index of
leading economic indicators was the biggest increase since a
1.6% jump in June 1988. But it didn't make up for a 1% drop
in February, and it left the index only 0.3% higher than it
was a year earlier.

   Economic analysts said the figures allay fears of a
recession, but don't point to robust growth. On a more
worrisome note, the report offers a bit more evidence to
bolster recent reports that inflation may accelerate.
   Most of the March increase in the indicators, which tend
to foreshadow broad movements in the economy, came in two
areas: plant and equipment orders, which were influenced by a
big increase in aircraft bookings, and prices of commodities
and raw materials.
   "There's no sign of a recession but not a lot of signs of
strong growth either," said David Wyss, chief financial
economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting concern
in Lexington, Mass. The increase in raw material prices, Mr.
Wyss added, "may be good for the indicators but it's not good
for the economy. It suggests higher prices for goods and more
inflation which could have to be choked off" by a rise in
interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said factory orders,
also boosted by the spike in aircraft orders, rose 3.8% in
March, to $240.37 billion, after a 1.8% increase in February.
The increases almost offset the 5.5% January decline.
   Orders for durable goods rose 6.6% to $128.70 billion,
while orders for nondurables increased 0.8% to $111.67
billion. An earlier report on durable goods, which are
intended to last at least three years, showed a 6.7%
increase.
   "The manufacturing sector is beginning to recover, but
it's not yet out of the woods," said Edward Campbell, senior
economist at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   Of the 11 statistics that make up the leading indicators
index six contributed to the March increase. In addition to
plant and equipment orders and raw material prices, they
were: new orders for consumer goods, stock prices, deliveries
by factories to suppliers, and a drop in claims for
unemployment benefits.
   Holding the index back in March were declines in building
permits, factory backlogs and the money supply. An index of
consumer expectations and the average workweek were
unchanged. Analysts attribute the drop in building permits to
the housing industry's slump, induced by higher interest
rates.
   "Within the composition we see a housing market that is
quite weak and a business sector which is beginning to show
signs of bottoming out," said Mr. Campbell. "I have been
positive on the economy and this reinforces my positive bent.
But it's still a mixed economy."
   The leading indicators have risen in four of the past six
months, and seven of the past nine, Mr. Wyss noted. However,
four of the increases in the past nine months were a mere
0.1%.
   Both reports are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced a 0.9% increase in the
index for March and a 1.0% decline for February.
