   WASHINGTON -- The staff of then-Vice President Bush
intervened to secure Department of Housing and Urban
Development funding for a project the agency had rejected in
1985 as ineligible, according to a former HUD official who
has admitted taking bribes.
   That intervention, according to DuBois Gilliam, a HUD
deputy assistant secretary during the Reagan administration,
led to a manipulation of federal monies to fund a $500,000
feasibility study on a trade center that was pushed by a
prominent supporter of the Reagan/Bush campaigns.

   According to Mr. Gilliam, Mr. Barreto then said he would
talk with Mr. Bush. Later that same day, Mr. Gilliam said, a
member of the vice president's staff contacted the HUD
secretary's executive assistant, Deborah Dean, who asked Mr.
Gilliam about the project.
   "She indicated to me she got a call from the vice
president's office and that they wanted the project funded,"
Mr. Gilliam told the subcommittee.
   Mr. Gilliam said he told Ms. Dean he would try to arrange
funding and called Kansas City officials, who moved funds
from the city's federally funded community development block
grant to the trade center. Mr. Gilliam added that the Kansas
City cash was replenished with money from the secretary's
discretionary fund.
   Mr. Barreto said in a telephone interview that Mr.
Gilliam's account is "a lot of malarkey." Although he "had a
lot of meetings with the vice president," Mr. Barreto said he
doesn't remember ever discussing the trade center
specifically with him.
   Kansas City's assistant city manager, James Threatt, said
in a telephone interview that Mr. Gilliam told city officials
that the vice president supported the program. "The city
reviewed the fund request for the proposed feasibility study
and determined it was not only eligible, but clearly
meritorious," said Mr. Threatt. "The proposal was considered
in two hearings before the city council and approved."
   A White House spokesman said: "We don't know anything
about it."
   Ms. Dean's attorney declined to comment.
   Mr. Gilliam is serving an 18-month prison sentence for
accepting payoffs in connection with his HUD duties. He
testified before the House Government Operations subcommittee
on housing and employment, which is investigating favoritism,
corruption and mismanagement at the agency during the Reagan
years.
   During his second of three days of testimony, Mr. Gilliam
described how important it was for projects to have a sponsor
within HUD to gain approval. He told how he, Ms. Dean and
Thomas Demery, then the assistant secretary for housing,
would discuss the allocation of so-called
moderate-rehabilitation housing grants.
   "If you weren't sitting at the table that day, you didn't
eat," he said. "Somebody had to be pushing your project."
   To avoid being caught in what he knew were questionable
and illegal activities, Mr. Gilliam said he would tear up his
notes about projects and carry them from the HUD office
building in a medicine bag for disposal.
   Nonetheless, the department's inspector general began
investigating him, and when it got too "hot," Mr. Gilliam
said he decided to resign in 1987, after more than three
years at HUD. But before he left, he tried to arrange a
severance package that subcommittee Chairman Thomas Lantos
(D., Calif.) estimated would have been worth millions of
dollars.
   Mr. Gilliam said he asked Ms. Dean to ask then-HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce to give Mr. Gilliam an allocation of
400 moderate-rehabilitation units, which Mr. Gilliam then
would develop. Mr. Pierce refused the 400 because he thought
"I was being greedy," Mr. Gilliam said, but the secretary did
approve 250 units.
   He never got any units, he added, because the inspector
general's investigation was getting too close to him.
   Mr. Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, issued a statement
that "Mr. Pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing and
improper conduct." The attorney added that it was
"inconceivable that the subcommittee has accepted, at face
value, the unsubstantiated testimony" of Mr. Gilliam.
