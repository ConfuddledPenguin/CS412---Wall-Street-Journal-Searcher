   NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc. has emerged as the
most powerful program trading firm on Wall Street, following
a big shakeout in the business after October's "minicrash."
   In the first quarter, the investment-banking firm traded
more than 100 million shares a month in computer-assisted
program trading strategies, according to New York Stock
Exchange data, or about as much volume as the entire Big
Board does on some slow days.

   Morgan Stanley's recent program trading is far more active
than that of any firm since the Big Board began releasing
data in 1988. It's even more striking because Morgan Stanley
and most other firms say they're no longer doing program
trading for themselves, only for customers.
   In March, Morgan Stanley traded as many shares as Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co., Philadelphia's Susquehanna Investment Group, a
program-trading specialist, and PaineWebber Group Inc.
combined. Morgan alone did 31.6% of the total program trading
volume in the first three months of this year. Program
trading accounts for about 10% of daily Big Board volume.
   Morgan Stanley's emergence as Wall Street's
program-trading powerhouse is partly attributable to its
competitors' queasiness over the strategy after the public
outcry against program trading late last year after the
October market plunge. Program trading involves the rapid
buying and selling of large baskets of stocks, and critics
have especially blamed one form of it, stock-index arbitrage,
for making the market more volatile. Morgan Stanley, by
keeping its doors wide open to customers, obviously thinks
the volatility debate is an open question.
   Another reason Morgan Stanley advanced to the head of the
program trading class is the increasing emphasis among
investors on computerized trading strategies in stocks,
futures and options markets around the world. Also, managers
of stock-index funds say Morgan Stanley has wooed clients
with its hot technology and trading dexterity.
   "I think they've continued to make a big investment in
technology," says Jeffrey Geller, managing director at BEA
Associates Inc., a large money management firm that uses
program trading.
   Last year, Morgan Stanley was in head-to-head competition
with such firms as Salomon Inc., General Electric Co.'s
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., PaineWebber and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
for top billing as a program trader for both customer and
proprietary accounts. But since the October minicrash, all of
these firms cut back or ceased stock-index arbitrage, the
most debated form of program trading, partly out of concern
for the market but also to keep small investors coming to
their retail brokerage offices.
   Morgan Stanley has no small investors to worry about and
is able to keep its doors open for those institutional
customers who want to use stock-index arbitrage strategies.
   Morgan Stanley's spokesmen have little to say on why the
firm is doing so much program trading. The firm is, in part,
cashing in on the demise in February of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., which created a big scare on Wall Street about
other firms and their stock-clearing operations. A number of
clients, who wanted to clear big trades through a stable
firm, migrated to Morgan Stanley, which boasts that its
clearing and settlement operations are as safe, fast and
efficient as any on the Street.
   Yet Morgan Stanley's activities have raised eyebrows among
some investors. The active trading by the firm's customers
appears in some cases to ignore the New York Stock Exchange's
request last November for a voluntary pullback from program
trading in times of volatile markets. A panel appointed by
the exchange currently is studying market volatility and
program trading as part of the exchange's response to the
public's outcry; results aren't expected until next month.
Morgan Stanley's chairman, S. Parker Gilbert, is a Big Board
director and member of the panel.
   The Big Board implored member firms to "ask their
customers to refrain from program trading, unless those
trades would have a stabilizing influence on the market." The
exchange's request was tantamount to a cease-and-desist
order, but it has been clearly ignored by the clients of
Morgan Stanley and other firms.
   For example, on Jan. 24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 60.42 points in the first half-hour of trading. During
that period Morgan Stanley sold 226,000 shares for a client.
Among other sellers, Susquehanna Investment Group sold
466,000 shares, PaineWebber 460,000, Merrill Lynch 219,000,
and Kidder Peabody 154,000.
   "All we can do is make sure customers are aware of the New
York Stock Exchange's position," a Morgan Stanley
spokesperson says. "But they have a need to adjust their
exposure to the market, and we can't tell them they can't
trade. They need access to the market."
   And Morgan Stanley prides itself on providing this access.
While other firms have shifted their program-trading focus
away from the U.S. to foreign markets, Morgan Stanley has
absorbed many clients who trade in the U.S. market.
   "They are good at client relationships," says Jeremy
Lefkowitz, managing director at Chancellor Capital Management
Inc.
   Individuals familiar with the firm's activities, speaking
on the condition they weren't identified, say Morgan
Stanley's rising market share in program trading may reflect
the firm's large technological investment in its trading
businesses. For example, the firm is currently negotiating
with Sun Microsystems Inc. and other concerns to purchase
several high-performance computer workstations. The people
familiar with the firm said the workstations will help link
trading departments to a central computer. In addition, these
workstations will allow Morgan Stanley traders to use some of
the hottest automated trading systems on the market today.
   Morgan Stanley recently installed a computer in its
trading room that carries an artificial intelligence trading
package designed by Dale Prouty, a physicist who has turned
his talents to the securities business as head of a company
called Integrated Analytics Corp. Mr. Prouty's brainchild,
called "MarketMind," is a powerful market-surveillance system
that can give traders up-to-the-second data on relationships
among hundreds of stocks, stock baskets, futures and options.
   While about half of Morgan Stanley's program trading in a
typical month involves stock-index arbitrage-rapid trades
among stocks, stock-index futures and options -- the other
half involves a variety of portfolio trading strategies.
George Douglas, formerly head of Drexel's quantitative
trading and research team, says Morgan Stanley is one of the
most aggressive firms when it comes to winning portfolio
trading business.
   "We've evaluated the capability of leading firms, and in
terms of aggressiveness and pricing, Morgan Stanley is right
at the top," says Mr. Douglas, now chairman of a consulting
firm, Dais Group Inc. He adds that many foreign investors are
using U.S. brokers to buy baskets of stocks. Also, Morgan
Stanley is said to be a large broker in already completed
arbitrage trades. Stock-index arbitrage is considered by many
money managers an alternative to short-term investments such
as Treasury bills. Brokers such as Morgan Stanley will sell
these money managers stock-index arbitrage trades that
usually deliver a return on investment a bit higher than
short-term interest rates. These trades are typically done in
London to get around technical rules in the U.S. market.
