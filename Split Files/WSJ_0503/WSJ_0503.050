   Technology shares again led over-the-counter stocks
higher, extending their gains for the week.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.4% to close at 423.58,
up 1.73. The Nasdaq 100 index of big industrial issues,
including some of the larger computer companies, outpaced the
broader index with a 0.7% gain, climbing 2.92 to 417.

   Volume rose to 143.2 million shares from 124.1 million
shares Tuesday. However, the margin of advancing over
declining issues narrowed as 956 gained and 901 fell.
   Shares of Seagate Technology and Oracle Systems were the
day's most active. Both companies are scheduled to appear
this morning at the final day of the Hambrecht &amp; Quist
technology conference in San Francisco. Seagate, a Scotts
Valley, Calif., maker of computer disk drives, closed up 3/4
at 12 3/8 on 2.2 million shares. Oracle, a Belmont, Calif.,
maker of database software, closed up 1 1/8 at 15 7/8 on more
than two million shares.
   While the conference spotlighted technology stocks,
Richard Bruno, director of OTC trading for PaineWebber, said
that this week's steady market has attracted some buyers.
"Both institutions and retail investors have come back on the
buy side after the market stabilized a couple days ago," Mr.
Bruno said, adding that fears of inflation and higher
interest rates appear to have faded somewhat.
   Robert C. King, head of OTC trading at Robinson Humphrey
in Atlanta, said investors there were coming in and "picking
away at stocks." While retail activity remained "spotty," Mr.
King pointed to some interest among some weaker Southeastern
banks shares, such as First American of Tennessee, up 1/8 at
13 1/8, and First Tennessee National in Memphis.
   Quantum, a Milpitas, Calif., maker of disk drives, climbed
1 1/8 to 15 3/4 on 1.9 million shares, more than four times
average volume. Late Tuesday, Quantum reported net income for
the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31 of 46 cents a share,
including an extraordinary gain of five cents a share, up
from 27 cents a share a year earlier. The company also said
it plans to buy as many as three million of its 24.6 million
shares outstanding.
   Valid Logic Systems rose 3/8 to 3 on nearly two million
shares, more than 10 times average volume. Late Tuesday,
International Business Machines said it will make an initial
investment in the San Jose, Calif., maker of software for
computer workstations representing 5% to 8.3% of Valid's
common shares. Valid also announced a first-quarter loss of
21 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of
five cents a share.
   MCI Communications issues continued to recover, hitting
$36 a share for the first time in two weeks. Chief financial
officer Daniel F. Akerson said the long-distance carrier
plans to sustain "solid, high-quality" earnings growth in the
1990s. MCI closed up 5/8 at 36 on 1.4 million shares.
   Other active technology stocks included Ashton Tate, up
1/4 at 11 1/8; Intel, up 5/8 at 40 1/4 and Apple Computer, up
1/8 at 39 3/4.
   Chiron jumped 1 3/8 to 30 1/2 after the Food and Drug
Administration approved a test for screening hepatitis C
offered jointly by the Emeryville, Calif., health care
product company and Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   Pacificare Health Systems advanced 1 1/4 to 18 after the
Cypress, Calif., health maintenance organization reported net
income for the second quarter ended March 31 of 33 cents a
share, compared with 18 cents a share a year earlier.
   Shares of EnClean climbed 1 to 12 after the Alvin, Texas,
provider of environmental cleaning services reported net
income for the third quarter ended March 31 of 20 cents a
share, up from two cents a share a year earlier.
   Nike climbed 1 3/4 to 71 1/4. Analysts with Montgomery
Securities and Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben recently spoke
positively about the Beaverton, Ore., athletic footwear and
apparel maker, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. A Nike spokesman said the company is comfortable with
analysts' earnings estimates ranging from $1.35 to $1.55 a
share for the fourth quarter ending this month, and $6 to
$6.20 a share for all of fiscal 1990. Those results aren't
scheduled for release until July 9, the news service said.
   Henley Group rose 2 to 37 3/4 after Michael D. Dingman,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Hampton, N.H.,
maker of industrial and scientific instruments, said the
company might spin off its Fisher Scientific Group Inc. and
Pneumo Abex Corp. units, in tax-free distributions to
shareholders.
   First Bancorp of Troy, N.C., slid 3 1/2 to 15 after the
bank rejected a proposed acquisition by CCB Financial, a
Durham, N.C., bank.
   Shares of NAC Re, a Greenwich, Conn. reinsurance holding
company, dropped 2 3/8 to 30 after the company reported net
income for the first quarter fell to 40 cents a share from 55
cents a share a year earlier.
   Gantos fell 1 3/4 to 9 1/2 after a Prescott Ball analyst
suggested that the Grand Rapids, Mich., specialty retailer's
April sales figures could be disappointing, according to
Professional Investor Report.

   AMGEN Inc. recently lost a round in patent infringement
litigation involving erythropoietin, an anti-anemia drug,
against Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan. Yesterday's OTC
Focus column mistakenly said that Amgen had won and that
Genetics Institute Inc. also was involved. Genetics Institute
is involved in a separate suit with Amgen.
