   SYDNEY -- An index of Australian consumer sentiment
plunged a seasonally adjusted 13.3% in April from March to
its lowest level on record.
   This confirms the economy is slowing, according to Westpac
Banking Corp., which compiles the monthly index with
Melbourne University's Institute of Applied Economic and
Social Research.

   The index has dropped 35.5% since reaching a peak in
September 1988. Rising Australian interest rates last year
sent consumer confidence sliding.
