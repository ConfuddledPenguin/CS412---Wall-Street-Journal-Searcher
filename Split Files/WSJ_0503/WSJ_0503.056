   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s finance arm and
defense-related subsidiary reported lower first-quarter net
income, but its Electronic Data Systems Corp.
computer-services unit posted a 10% gain.
   All together, GM's three big non-automotive units posted
combined first-quarter profit of $591.4 million, down 6% from
a year earlier. The No. 1 auto maker is scheduled to report
first-quarter results for the rest of its operations,
including its core vehicle business, today.

   At GM Hughes Electronics Corp., which includes the defense
operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and the automotive
electronics operations of Delco Electronics Corp.,
first-quarter earnings slumped 16% to $145.6 million, or 46
cents a Class H share, from $172.9 million, or 51 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5.1% to $2.86 billion.
The unit blamed the declines on a combination of reduced
Pentagon spending and lower vehicle sales.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp., the auto maker's finance
arm, said first-quarter net income dropped 5.6% to $336
million from $356 million a year earlier. GMAC said its
year-earlier net reflected a onetime gain of $51 million from
the sale of GMAC's 51% interest in Isuzu Motors Finance Co.
to Isuzu Motors Ltd. However, the finance unit said it also
had a $48 million gain in the 1990 quarter, attributable to
changes in accounting practices related to certain European
operations.
   At Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems, meanwhile,
earnings rose 10% to $109.8 million, or 46 cents a Class E
share, from $100 million, or 41 cents a share. Revenue rose
10% to $1.42 billion. About 46% of EDS's first-quarter
revenue came from business outside GM. EDS has said its goal
is to have non-GM business equal revenue from the parent
company by the end of this year.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, GM
Class H stock, which represents dividend interest in GM
Hughes Electronics earnings, closed at $22.25, down 12.5
cents. GM Class E stock, which is tied to EDS, closed at
$30.625, up 25 cents. GMAC doesn't have a separately traded
stock; its profit contributes to the earnings for GM's common
stock.
   GM common closed at $44.75, up 50 cents.
