   Somewhere in the late morning of May Day, on Tuesday, the
phone rang and a voice asked if I would be prepared to go on
Ted Koppel's Nightline that same evening. I asked cautiously
what the theme was going to be. The voice, belonging to the
Koppel Show's Ms. Tracy Day, said that Mr. Koppel and his
guests would be addressing the theme "Is Communism Dead?"
   I grew more cautious still. When TV producers are figuring
out the balance of a show I'm reckoned to be over in the
"left wild man" category. In the early and mid1980s, when
panels on terrorism were all the rage, I'd be invited on,
confronted with a full-color picture of hideous carnage,
replete with mangled babies, and then asked with heavy
sarcasm how I justified this kind of behavior. Lately I've
noticed I'm often described as "controversial," which is a
flash card to the audience: Rabid, approach with extreme
suspicion.

   I outlined to Ms. Day my position: that while the old
Communist regimes either had already or are in the process of
falling apart under the weight of their own ossification and
repressiveness, this didn't mean that communist or socialist
ideals are dead and that anyway, if we were going to talk
about dying communism we should also discuss how capitalism
was faring across large portions of the globe, such as Africa
or Latin America. Answer, badly.
   In Eastern Europe millions of people chafed under the
yokes of archaic Stalinist regimes, finally throwing them
off. In Central America they battle against the capitalist
tyrannies supported by the U.S. and get massacred for their
pains.
   By late afternoon in Los Angeles, which is where I
happened to be, Ms. Day called from New York. I'd be on with
Angela Davis and Melor Sturua, a Russian columnist for
Izvestia on leave at the Carnegie Endowment.
   So it probably wasn't going to be a Crossfire-type
situation, with brutal fisticuffs: "Mr. Cockburn, as a keen
admirer of Stalin and his Gulag empire . . ." I won't go on
those shows. They're a waste of time. Either you repeat
conventional thoughts or sound like a madman, which is of
course what they want you to be, tricked out with the cap,
bells and bomb of the controversial terrorist Stalin-lover.
   One of the beauties of the propaganda system embodied by
the mainstream media here is that complexity is impossible.
Take the "death of communism." Any rational discussion would
try to examine what kind of economies were constructed in
Eastern Europe. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany,
collectivization of agriculture worked pretty well. Ditto in
Bulgaria, where Communists now stand a chance in a free
election. In the Soviet Union the "free-market" advisers to
Mikhail Gorbachev urge a Polish solution, but workers vow to
resist and fight for anti-capitalist rights-full employment,
protection of public assets and so forth. It's complicated.
   On European TV and radio you can talk seriously for 30
minutes or even an hour. Here, as an almost constant rule,
that's possible only on listener-subscribed FM radio. Radio
is inherently more democratic than TV. Otherwise we're in the
world of the McLaughlin Group: "Mr. Cockburn, in a word, is
Communism dead or not?" "Well . . ." "Thank you Mr.
Cockburn."
   I drive east across Los Angeles toward the ABC studios,
thinking about communism and capitalism, pondering my
strategy. From previous experience on Nightline I know that
one has time to make about three points, like a dog barking
through the fence. What will I say?
   May Day: It began in the late 1880s, as part of the
American working-class movement's struggle for the eight-hour
day. I rehearse, shouting out to the stream of commuters
heading the other way into Santa Monica: "Well Ted, we still
haven't got the eight-hour day. It's compulsory overtime for
some workers and unemployment for others, as the East Germans
will soon find out. A hundred years ago battle for the
eight-hour day began as a socialist ideal and it's still
valid. In fact, more valid than ever. Workers these days
often have to work two jobs, 16 hours or more, just to keep
afloat."
   I plan to talk about the ideals of socialism as set
against the collapse of the old Communist regimes, but also
about trends in capitalism: In much of the world "market
economies" survive only in the guise of authoritarian, quasi
or actually fascist regimes. The battle of the next world
generation will be between this tooth-and-claw market
authoritarianism and democratic planning.
   At the ABC studios they make me up and sit me down. The
drill with Mr. Koppel is that you look into a camera and
listen to you earphone. You can't see what's happening. You
have to keep looking at the camera because you don't know
when Mr. Koppel, the only person who can see all the people
on the show, who controls everything, is going to call on
you. Swivel your eyes away from the camera and millions will
think you have something to hide.
   Suddenly we're off. I can hear the soundtrack of some
footage; of people hammering down the Wall, denouncing
communism. Then I hear Mr. Koppel saying, ". . . the state of
distress in which Communism finds itself. . . . seems easier
for some Soviets to accept than for . . . left-wingers like
Alexander Cockburn or leaders of the American Communist Party
like Angela Davis." So it's a setup: The viewers have been
invited to watch scenes of collapsing communism, then here's
Mr. Koppel cutting to the last dinosaurs, clanking into the
studio dragging the ball and chain of dead, bad ideas. Had
Tracy Day told Mr. Koppel the lines I was thinking along? Had
Mr. Koppel decided to shackle me and Prof. Davis as
gauleiters of the gulag, offset by the virtuous Mr. Sturua,
symbol of New Thinking and penitence for the past?
   This was the trend of the show. Mr. Koppel got
increasingly testy. Why, he asked, did I keep bringing up
capitalism? We were meant to be talking about communism. It
became a dialogue of the deaf. I said in order to understand
why millions of people around the world are still fired with
socialist ideals you have to understand that if actually
existing communism was and is abhorrent to some, actually
existing capitalism is abhorrent to others.
   I was going to add that on the same May Day that Russian
workers were booing the Soviet leaders, workers in the
Philippines were demonstrating against the regime and the
U.S. bases, and in South Korea striking shipyard workers were
still battling police.
   No time for this though. By now Mr. Koppel was saying that
I was putting words into his mouth and Prof. Davis was trying
to explain that capitalism was not working too well for black
people here in the U.S. and Mr. Sturua was saying that Karl
Marx was right when he said that theory was gray but green
the tree of life. From the corner of my eye I saw a copy of
Business Week featuring on its cover the best-paid executive
of 1989, Craig McCaw, weighing in with $53.9 million. Why
didn't I just hold it up to the camera and say that against
salaries like this, how could the ideals of socialism ever
die? But it was all over. I didn't even have time to tell Mr.
Sturua that Goethe, not Marx, said the thing about the green
tree. At least he had Marx associated with living things.
