   WINNIPEG, Manitoba -- John Fraser, president and chief
executive officer of Federal Industries Ltd., said the
industrial holding company expects a 15% to 20% decline in
net income this year as a result of the "deteriorating
economic outlook" in Canada.
   In 1989, the company had net income of 45.6 million
Canadian dollars (US$39.1 million) or C$1.66 a share, on
revenue of C$2.28 billion. Mr. Fraser had said earlier this
year that the company expected 1990 net to be about the same
level.

   "The outlook now is worse than it was three, four, six
months ago," Mr. Fraser said. "{Interest} rates have stayed
surprisingly high; the {strong} Canadian dollar seems to defy
gravity; and we have a serious fiscal situation with the
deficit."
   He said the Canadian manufacturing sector is already in a
recession.
   Results for the first quarter of the year, due to be
released Wednesday, will be "quite dramatically" lower than
the year-earlier C$8.9 million, or 31 Canadian cents a share,
Mr. Fraser said. He declined to give a specific estimate.
   "The first quarter is always our weakest quarter," he
said. "Nearly all of our businesses have a seasonal component
to them."
   The company has four operating divisions: consumer
products, metals, industrial products and transportation.
   Mr. Fraser said the company's newly acquired bookstore
chain, W.H. Smith, had been expected to report a
first-quarter operating loss. In addition, the economic
slowdown in Ontario and Quebec hurt Federal's trucking
operations in those provinces. Earnings at the metals group
also declined in the first quarter.
   But Mr. Fraser noted that the company's first-quarter
earnings drop shouldn't be taken as an indication of the size
of the decline it expects for the year as a whole.
   Federal Industries generates about 80% of its
approximately C$2.2 billion in annual sales from its steel
service and distribution centers as well as its trucking
division.
