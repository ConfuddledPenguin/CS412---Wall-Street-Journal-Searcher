   A drug marketed by a Procter &amp; Gamble Co. subsidiary is
the first medicine to reverse bone damage caused by
osteoporosis, the degenerative disease that affects aging
women, a study shows.
   Researchers said the drug etidronate had a "significant"
effect in preventing fractures of brittle bones associated
with osteoporosis. "It's extremely exciting," said Harry K.
Genant, a researcher at the University of California, San
Francisco, who participated in a three-year study of 66 women
with doctors from Sundby Hospital in Copenhagen.

   Dr. Genant said the research "provided the first
conclusive evidence that a drug can increase bone mass and
prevent fractures" in women already afflicted with the
disease. At present, doctors try to prevent bone thinning by
prescribing estrogen drugs for women who have yet to develop
the disease. Most treatments in women who already experience
bone thinning rarely work, Dr. Genant said.
   The drug is sold by P&amp;G's Norwich Eaton subsidiary under
the brand name Didronel as a treatment for a rare bone
problem called Paget's disease. Officials at Norwich Eaton
said the company plans to use the latest research, and
several other studies, to seek approval later this year from
the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug for use
against osteoporosis.
   About 20 million U.S. women, mostly over the age of 50,
suffer from osteoporosis.
   In the study, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors found the bones of women given etidronate
showed a 5% gain in bone mass in their vertebrae and in their
arms while those taking a placebo showed a 3% loss. Moreover,
the group taking the drug experienced far fewer fractures
than did the placebo group.
   Etidronate is one of a class of drugs called
diphosphonates that appear to work by coating bone cells and
preventing loss of bone tissue. Bone cells normally lose this
tissue, but women with osteoporosis are unable to replace it.
The doctors found that the drug worked when administered for
just two weeks every four months. Previous research had shown
that continuous administration produced irregular bone
formation.
   P&amp;G discovered the drug while studying diphosphonates for
detergents. Several other drug companies, including Merck &amp;
Co., also are testing diphosphonate-related drugs, but none
is expected to be approved for general use soon.
