   LOS ANGELES -- Mayor Tom Bradley proposed a mandatory
water conservation plan to cut individual water use 10% from
1986 levels as the state faces a fourth consecutive year of
drought.
   The plan would include penalties for excess use and the
hiring of additional workers to enforce the program. The
proposal, which must be enacted by the City Council, would be
the toughest yet in the struggle to curtail use by homes,
businesses and corporations.

   A voluntary conservation program has been in effect since
April 1988, but Mayor Bradley said that "we are facing a
crisis." Those who have voluntarily reduced consumption 10%
won't be required to make additional cuts. The mayor urged
the council to act on the plan "as soon as possible," which
could mean the program may be in place in six weeks, but
local officials said full implementation could take months.
   Preliminary water runoff projections from the eastern
Sierra watershed are about half the normal level for the
summer months, according to L.A. Department of Water and
Power officials. The runoff is even lower than that of the
past few drought years.
   In Northern California, the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a proposal for
mandatory 25% cuts in water use based on 1987 consumption.
The rationing, if approved, would be similar to a mandatory
program in place from May 1988 to May 1989, said Cheryl
Davis, acting manager of the San Francisco Water Department's
customer service unit.
