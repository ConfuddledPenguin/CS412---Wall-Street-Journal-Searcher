   AUSTIN, Texas -- HealthVest, a real estate investment
trust, said it has complied with documentation requirements
of a standstill agreement with lenders and expects the accord
to remain in effect until Dec. 14.
   Under terms, HealthVest's lender groups have agreed to
refrain from foreclosing on about $270 million of property
that was pledged as collateral to secure about $252 million
in debt.
