   SOUTH AFRICA OPENED exploratory talks with the nation's
black leaders.
   Beginning three days of historic discussions in Cape Town
aimed at black-white power-sharing, President de Klerk's
government and the African National Congress quickly agreed
on an agenda to address specific problems blocking full-scale
constitutional negotiations. De Klerk called the meeting a
part of the "irreversible process of normalization," and ANC
leader Nelson Mandela said the talks "must make a decisive .
. . contribution to the repudiation" of the apartheid system.

   LITHUANIA AGREED to consider suspending some
pro-independence laws.
   In a letter to French and West German leaders who last
week proposed that such a compromise could lead to talks with
the Kremlin, President Landsbergis said the breakaway Baltic
republic was willing to temporarily freeze some secessionist
legislation that prompted Moscow's partial economic embargo.
Lithuania's legislature approved the correspondence, which
said "everything is negotiable" except the republic's March
11 declaration of independence.
   Latvia's Popular Front unveiled an independence plan that
it hopes won't provoke a Kremlin crackdown. The republic's
legislature opens today.

   East and West Germany reached agreement on a plan for an
economic merger by July 2. The accord calls for exchanging
East German wages, salaries, and pensions at a favorable
1-to-1 rate, but limits the amount of savings to be swapped
on par. It also gives East Berlin a political boost for
Sunday's local elections.
                                                                                                       

   Baker said that NATO membership for a united Germany

Union. But the secretary of state, preparing for this

consider Moscow's views when he meets tomorrow with
Shevardnadze.

   The Bush administration proposed a "complete overhaul" of

restricted.

   A former HUD official testified before a House panel that
then-Vice President Bush's staff intervened to secure funding
for a project that had been rejected in 1985. DuBois Gilliam,
an aide to ex-Secretary Pierce, said the intervention led to
a $500,000 feasibility study on a trade center backed by a
Reagan/Bush supporter.

   The U.S. and NATO allies are expected to propose scrapping
plans for new short-range missiles in West Germany, according

Moscow on eliminating superpower nuclear artillery shells in
Europe.

   Former hostage Reed disclosed that he was held for months
with two other U.S. captives in Lebanon, and said he was
angry and embarrassed that they haven't been freed. Speaking
in West Germany, the 57-year-old educator, who was released
Sunday in Beirut after 42 months in captivity, also said he
was held with two Britons.
                                                                                                       

   The White House said it hasn't received any indications
that another U.S. hostage would be freed. In Tehran,
spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would press its
efforts for the release of Western captives, but rejected any
talks with the U.S.

an agreement. The two parties ousted the Communists in
nationwide parliamentary elections last month.

which straddles the border between New York and Ontario.
