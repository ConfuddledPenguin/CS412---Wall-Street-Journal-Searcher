   Canyon Resources Corp. said a unit of Kennecott Corp.
acquired two million of its common shares, or an 8% stake,
for $5 million and committed $1 million to fund operations of
a gold-mining venture.
   The commitment represents the first stage of an agreement
that could result in Kennecott Exploration Co. earning a 51%
stake in the venture by funding $25 million of operations and
aquiring four million Canyon Resources common shares for $10
million.

   The funding covers operations in Panamint Range, Calif.,
which Canyon acquired in January when it purchased Addwest
Gold Inc. So far, Canyon has defined one gold deposit on the
property of 17.2 million tons of rock with an average grade
of 0.035 ounce of gold per ton.
   Canyon is based in Golden, Colo.
