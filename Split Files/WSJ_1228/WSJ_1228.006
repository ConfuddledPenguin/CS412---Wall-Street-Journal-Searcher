   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
long-distance rates will drop on New Year's Eve.
   AT&amp;T said it will cut its standard weekday rates on
interstate calls made from the continental U.S. by 32% on
Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m.

   For instance, a 10-minute, direct-dialed daytime call from
New York to Los Angeles that normally costs $2.49 will cost
only $1.49 on New Year's Eve, said AT&amp;T.
   AT&amp;T also said subscribers to its Reach Out America
discount calling plans will get additional rate cuts
depending on which plan they have.
   AT&amp;T's competitors MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint
Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.,
also will offer holiday discounts. On New Year's Day, Sprint
said it will apply its lower evening rates to calls made
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Similarly, MCI will apply its lower
night-weekend rates to holiday pricing.
