   Westpac Banking Corp. of Wellington, Australia, said it
offered to acquire Southland Building &amp; Investment Society,
New Zealand's biggest mutually owned savings institution with
assets of about 400 million New Zealand dollars (US$235
million).
   A Westpac spokesman wouldn't disclose financial details of
the offer. The 50,000 members of Southland are to hold an
extraordinary meeting in February to consider the offer.

   The proposed acquisition is the first expansion by Westpac
in New Zealand in about seven years. If successful, Westpac
intends to maintain Southland as a wholly owned but separate
entity. An application to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for
a full banking license for Southland would be made if the bid
is successful, Westpac said.
