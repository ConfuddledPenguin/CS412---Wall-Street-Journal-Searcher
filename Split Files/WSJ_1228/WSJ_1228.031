   WEST CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. -- U.S. Bioscience Inc. said it
received its first drug approval from the Food and Drug
Administration for Hexalen, an anti-cancer agent used in the
treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.
   U.S. Bioscience officials hailed the drug's approval as a
significant step in the pharmaceutical company's development.
An FDA spokeswoman said the drug shows "significant
theraputic gains."

   Shareholders quickly reacted to news of the drug's
approval. In American Stock Exchange trading Thursday, U.S.
Bioscience closed at $19.875, up 87.5 cents. "We were pleased
to see that the market hadn't already discounted the drug's
approval," said Larry Longeacre, the company's chief
financial officer.
   U.S. Bioscience said it plans to launch Hexalan, an agent
formerly known as Hexamethylmelamine, in the U.S. in late
January 1991. In addition, officials said the company plans
to file a product license application in the United Kingdom
in early 1991. It already has several agreements with other
companies for markets in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe,
Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Africa.
   A company official said the cost of the drug for a five to
six month treatment runs about $1,000 per patient. U.S.
Bioscience said Hexalan has shown the ability to eliminate
evidence of tumors in cases where other treatments have
failed.
   Originally formed as a subsidiary of U.S. Health Care,
U.S. Bioscience was spun off as an independent drug company
in 1987. In addition to Hexalen, the company currently has
nine other anti-cancer drugs in various stages of
development.
