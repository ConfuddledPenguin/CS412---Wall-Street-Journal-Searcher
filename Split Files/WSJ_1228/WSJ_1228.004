   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration said it
will launch a nationwide program in February to test the milk
supply for antibiotics and other veterinary drug residues.
   While the FDA has monitored state milk-testing programs
and conducted a few surveys of its own, this will be the
first time the agency has engaged in routine testing of milk
for illegal drug residues. But some critics challenged the
agency's claim that the new program "will add another layer
of protection for consumers."

   The agency has been under pressure from consumer groups
and Congress to step up its surveillance of the dairy
industry since December 1989, when The Wall Street Journal
conducted a milk survey in 10 U.S. cities and reported
finding 38% of 50 skim and low-fat milk samples tainted with
antibiotics or sulfa drugs. The Journal also reported that
the testing method used by state officials, though effective
in detecting penicillin and penicillin-related drugs, was all
but blind to sulfamethazine, a suspected carcinogen banned
from agricultural use, and numerous other drugs.
   Another impetus for greater surveillance is the apparent
misuse of veterinary drugs in dairying. In a recent survey,
FDA officials found illegal drugs in 27% of some 1,800 dairy
barns they checked -- despite drug-education efforts by the
milk industry and regulatory agencies. "That's pretty
shocking," said consumer advocate Lisa Lefferts of the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   Under the new program, raw milk will be tested for eight
sulfa drugs, including sulfamethazine, and three tetracycline
drugs. FDA spokeswoman Bonnie Aikman said these are the drugs
"of most concern because they have been widely misused" by
dairy farmers and veterinarians.
   But critics, including Rep. Ted Weiss (D., N.Y.), weren't
impressed with the FDA plan to test five samples each week
that will be collected from milk trucks making deliveries at
250 randomly selected milk-processing plants.
   This approach "means that each processing location in the
FDA's program will be visited only once a year," complained
Mr. Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources. "FDA's attempt to describe
this as a `nationwide program' is ludicrous. . . . The
subcommittee will need to examine whether the agency
purposely designed a plan that would not find any residues."
   Ms. Lefferts agreed, saying, "Testing five samples a week
isn't going to solve the problem of illegal and potentially
dangerous drugs in our milk."
   But Gerald Guest, director of the FDA's Center for
Veterinary Medicine, defended the program. "Without extra
resources, this is the best we can do in the first year," he
said. The samples "are going to give us pretty good coverage
across the country. It's a modest effort, but it's
meaningful."
   The milk samples will be collected by state officials and
tested at FDA laboratories. When violative residues are
found, the agency will alert state officials and help them
trace the source of the problem. As new analytical methods
are developed, samples will be tested for more than 11 drugs.
   The program will supplement routine state testing of raw
and processed milk for penicillins, FDA officials said. At
the same time, the agency will continue to monitor the
efforts of state regulators.
   The FDA has only done three milk surveys of its own,
beginning in 1988. In a report last month, the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
dismissed the surveys as statistically invalid, calling them
"snapshots in time of a small number of milk samples tested
for the presence of a small number of drug residues."
   The GAO concluded that the agency couldn't substantiate
its assertions that the nation's milk supply is safe to
drink.
