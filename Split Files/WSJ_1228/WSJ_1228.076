   Dana Corp., a maker of vehicle parts, said it will seek to
sell its Diamond Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary in Findlay, Ohio,
and that it retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to advise Dana with
the proposed sale.

   Dana, of Toledo, Ohio, plans to expand its distribution
and international activities in the next 10 years, said
Southwood J. Morcott, Dana's chairman and chief executive
officer. "We feel that the interests of Diamond's customers,
depositors and employees would best be served by affiliation
with a strong parent which is committed to growth and
expansion in the thrift or banking industries."
