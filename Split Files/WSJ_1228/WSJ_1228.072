   BAD NEWS FOR MRS. MARCOS

   The Swiss Supreme Court has given its conditional approval
to repatriate to the Philippines about 480 million Swiss
francs ($366.4 million) of "ill-gotten wealth" allegedly
channeled to Switzerland by the late President Ferdinand E.
Marcos and his associates.
   The court ruled that the funds, frozen in several Swiss
banks since March 1986, must be returned as soon as a
criminal court in the Philippines has issued a "legally
binding" verdict in the case. It gave the Philippines a year
to open the criminal proceedings.
   The court said the trial must conform to the standards set
in the Swiss Federal Constitution and the European Human
Rights Convention, covering chiefly the independence of the
judiciary and the impartiality of judges.
   The ruling rejected 11 appeals against lower-court
decisions to release funds blocked at Credit Suisse in the
canton of Zurich and at Swiss Bank Corp. in the canton of
Fribourg. The appeals were filed by lawyers on behalf of Mr.
Marcos's widow, Imelda, and others.
                                                                                                       

   CABINET SHUFFLE IN SOUTH KOREA
                                                                                                       

   South Korea's President Roh Tae Woo changed 10 cabinet
posts in a step that analysts said was aimed largely at
improving his party's image ahead of local elections
scheduled for February. Ro Jai Bong, a chief Roh aide and a
U.S.-educated university professor, was named to succeed
Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon. The new foreign minister will
be Lee Sang Ock, now chief of a mission to international
agencies in Geneva.
                                                                                                       

   INDIA INCREASES INCOME TAXES

   India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha introduced a bill
to increase the surcharge on taxable annual income of over
$4,165 to 12% from 8%. He also said deductions on
depreciation would be limited to 75% of the previous maximum.
The two proposals were the second money-raising measures
announced by India's seven-week-old government, which last
week raised customs and excise duties on a range of goods.
                                                                                                       

   THE FATE OF 6,000 WOMEN
                                                                                                       

   The fate of 6,000 Japanese women married to Koreans will
be raised in next month's scheduled talks between Japanese
and North Koreans in Pyongyang. The women married Koreans who
were forced to work in Japan during its colonial rule of the
peninsula, and then migrated with their husbands to North
Korea. Since resettling, not one of the women has been
permitted by North Korea to return to Japan, even to see
dying relatives. The talks offer new hope that North Korea,
in order to establish diplomatic relations with Japan, will
agree to restore freedom of travel to these women.
                                                                                                       

   WELCOME VISITORS
                                                                                                       

   The spending power of the 14,500 European Community civil
servants in Brussels totals $978 million a year, while
Brussels-based EC institutions spend $353 million a year on
rents, utilities and taxes, according to a study commissioned
by the Brussels regional government. Brussels, locked in a
battle with Strasbourg to be chosen as the permanent home of
the European Parliament, intends to launch a campaign to make
its EC visitors feel more at home, notably by reducing the
hassles inflicted by the local bureaucracy.
                                                                                                       

   INDONESIA IS WORRIED
                                                                                                       

   Indonesia is worried that its "Visit Indonesia Year 1991"
promotion could turn Jakarta into Asia's latest sin city, a
Jakarta newspaper said. "If there are tourists who come to
Jakarta seeking `good times,' then they should not have come
here," the Observer newspaper quoted Jakarta Vice-Governor
Basofi Sudirman as saying.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN: NO SHARP SLOWDOWN
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Economic Planning Agency said in its annual report
that it sees no signs of a sharp slowdown in the Japanese
economy, but it stressed the need for maintaining price
stability in order to secure sustained growth.
   The report noted that the Japanese economy entered its
fifth uninterrupted year of growth in December, underpinned
by domestic demand such as personal consumption and corporate
capital spending. Personal spending and corporate capital
outlays both continue to grow steadily, while housing
investment remains at high levels, the report said.
   The report added, however, that rising interest rates have
started restraining housing construction and holding down
corporate sales, earnings and equipment investment by pushing
up borrowing costs.
   Yesterday, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry announced that production at Japanese factories and
mines went up 6.6% in November from a year earlier, though it
dropped 1% from the previous month. Ministry officials said
the latest statistics indicate that Japan's economic activity
remains strong.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Argentina's inflation for December will be about 5%, the
lowest in 14 months, Planning Secretary Moises Ikonicoff
said. If the cost of living increase doesn't top 5%, it will
have slowed for the fourth straight month. The nation's
inflation rate has exceeded 5% every month but four since
July 1986. . . . British and Spanish animal-rights groups
have filed a complaint with the European Community accusing
Spanish slaughterhouses of ignoring EC rules requiring that
animals be stunned before slaughter.
