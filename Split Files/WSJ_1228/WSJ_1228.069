   Census Data Dim Democrats' White House Hopes
   As Growth Was Greater in Republican States

   WASHINGTON -- Democrats are worrying that in the past
several days the job of recapturing the White House may have
grown even more difficult.
   The population shifts that undergird the new Census Bureau
reapportionment figures have been going on for years, but
only this week has the political map been adjusted to reflect
them. The government's new decennial atlas of American
politics makes it clear that the path to the White House goes
through firmly Republican territory.

   "The first message from these figures is that the
Democrats' trouble just got worse," says Larry Bartels, a
University of Rochester political scientist who is an expert
in presidential elections. "They needed a new strategy even
if there weren't going to be adjustments in the Electoral
College, but it's particularly critical now that the map is
changing."
   The political changes that are being ushered in by the new
population figures go far beyond the shifts in the size of
congressional delegations in 21 states and the emergence of
California, Texas and Florida, whose combined delegations
comprise about a quarter of the House. The number of votes in
the Electoral College is the total of each state's House and
Senate members, giving increased power in presidential
elections to several states that are safely Republican and
decreasing the Electoral College votes of several states that
are within the Democrats' grasp in presidential elections.
   Presidential elections, to be sure, are shaped by
important geopolitical and economic factors, and the Persian
Gulf crisis that remains unresolved as President Bush
approaches his third year in power may be more important in
1992 than any long-term voter trends. Even so, Democrats
worry that the new figures released by the Census Bureau may
make their challenge even tougher.
   "Just by sheer population trends alone, the Republicans
gained a huge leg up in the next election," says Paul Maslin,
a Democratic political strategist. "Every 10 years that go by
is going to mean the geography is even worse."
   The states of Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina,
Arizona and Virginia, considered safe or probable Republican
states in the 1992 election and perhaps beyond, gained a
total of 11 electoral votes as a result of the figures the
Census Bureau released this week. New York, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Iowa and West Virginia, considered
safe or probable Democratic states in a reasonably close
election, lost a total of 10 electoral votes.
   That's bad news for a party that has lost all but three of
the 10 presidential elections after the Roosevelt-Truman era.
Moreover, the new geography of politics has already amplified
the cries within the Democratic Party for an overhaul of its
strategies and policies.
   "We need Democrats who can win in areas that are growing,
Democrats that are pro-growth, pro-opportunity, pro-family,
tough on crime and have a sense of limited government but who
aren't anti-government," says Alvin From, executive director
of the Democratic Leadership Council, which styles itself as
a forum for moderate Democrats. "The census only reinforces
the need for Democrats to change."
   The Census Bureau figures underline the growing importance
of California, both in the House and in presidential
elections, and it signals a glimmer of hope for Democrats
thirsty for victory in presidential elections. Nearly one out
of eight members of the House that will be elected in
November 1992 will be from California; the state's 52 seats
will be by far the largest congressional delegation in
history.
   But in the past two presidential elections, where liberal
Democrats have run against conservative Republicans, the
Democrats have done slightly better in California than in the
rest of the country. Democrats felt that if Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had run a better campaign in 1988 the
Democrats could have won California, which hasn't fallen in
the Democratic column since Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide,
and taken a sweep of the Pacific coast.
   GOP political theorist Kevin Philips believes that if the
Democrats do prevail in California, they could win a
presidential election without even carrying the popular vote.
   In any case, virtually no Democratic strategy for winning
the White House can succeed without California and its 54
electoral votes. Barring a political upheaval or the
emergence of a strong issue such as an unsuccessful
resolution of the Gulf crisis that penalizes the Republicans,
the GOP can get to about 200 of the 270 electoral votes
required for victory with their natural base, which now
includes many states in the deep South. With California and
one other large state such as Ohio or Michigan, both of which
have fallen into GOP hands repeatedly, they are over the top.
   The Census Bureau figures put the population movements of
the past decade, and their political implications, in sharp
relief. As it has since the earliest days of the 19th
century, the U.S. political power center is moving west; the
northeastern states, which comprised more than half the
representation in the first Congress and more than a quarter
of the House when the western frontier officially disappeared
in 1890, will have only a fifth of the House in the 102nd
Congress.
   The population shift away from the so-called Frostbelt
states, a dramatic feature of the 1980 census, has continued.
"The balance of power is shifting to the `Sunbelt,'" says
Candis Penn, executive director of the Southern Governors
Association. "The country may not realize it now, but once
reapportionment gets under way it will be very clear."
   The implications for the House remain murky, however.
Although Democrats have had scant success in presidential
elections, they have built up large majorities in the House
while the Republicans have struggled to find credible House
candidates and to elect them.
   "The fact that Bush carried so many states in 1988 may be
overblown in these calculations," says William O'Hare,
director of policy studies for the non-partisan Population
Research Bureau. "People vote differently for Congress than
they do for president, and you can't carry the presidential
interpretation too far."
   Now that the numbers are out, the real politics gets under
way. The states begin their redistricting processes next
spring, using census data to reshape districts for the state
legislature as well as for Congress.
   And in Washington, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
must make the politically charged decision by mid-July on
whether to adjust the 1990 figures to correct for the
undercount of minorities and the poor. The latest wrinkle:
Commerce officials dread being caught in the crossfire when
it becomes clear that blacks likely would gain representation
but Hispanics probably would lose from a statistical
adjustment.
