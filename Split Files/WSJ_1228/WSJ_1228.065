   Big beverage companies are expected to report strong
earnings gains for the fourth quarter, as consumers continue
to drink more soft drinks and embrace new brands of beer.
   Coca-Cola Co.'s earnings may jump as much as 25% from the
1989 fourth quarter, and PepsiCo Inc.'s increase may be even
greater, analysts estimate. Anheuser-Busch Cos. is seen
posting an earnings gain of 11% to 23%. Adolph Coors Co. is
expected to report flat or reduced earnings for the fourth
quarter but a gain of 50% or more for the year.

   "People don't cut back on things that give them pleasure
if it's a small amount of money," said Martin Romm, a First
Boston Corp. analyst. Nevertheless, analysts are predicting
slower earnings growth for beverage concerns in 1991.
   For Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which is expected to post
fourth-quarter earnings of about 45 cents a share, the story
remains the same: strong performance overseas, where the
company gets 80% of its profits. Coca-Cola will probably meet
its goal of increasing shipments of concentrate overseas by
8% to 10% in 1990, analysts said.
   The company's investments in Japan and Europe, including a
high-speed canning facility that opened last May in Dunkirk,
France, and a high-speed canning and bottling facility that
opened last June in Wakefield, England, are paying off in
continued sales growth.
   Coca-Cola, which gets about one-fourth of its
international sales from the European Community, also
benefited from the weak dollar, analysts said.
   At home, Coca-Cola's fourth-quarter volume is up 5% or
more, according to some analysts, including a boost of one or
two percentage points from Burger King restaurants' switch to
Coke from Pepsi.
   As Wendy's restaurants start making the same conversion,
sales of Coke at the fountain may grow faster than sales of
bottled and canned Coke, despite the slowdown in the
restaurant industry, said Roy Burry, a Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
analyst.
   Analysts predict per-share earnings of $1.95 to $2.10 for
Coca-Cola in 1990, up about 20% from last year.
   For PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., analysts see
fourth-quarter earnings of 32 cents to 36 cents a share,
bringing fiscal-year earnings to about $1.35, or an increase
of 19% from 1989. The company said it is comfortable with
that estimate. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, PepsiCo
net was 27 cents a share excluding a onetime charge of two
cents a share, which means fourth-quarter per-share net could
be up by as much as 44%.
   Although volume growth for Pepsi's soft-drink business
slowed in the fourth quarter, to between 1% and 3%, the
company is reaping big benefits from new price strategies in
its restaurant chains, and from cost-control measures such as
the distribution of hand-held computers to cut down on paper
work, analysts said.
   "They're very, very good at squeezing costs out of the
business," said Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst
who sees a 24% earnings gain for PepsiCo in 1991, despite the
recession.
   PepsiCo's Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken chains have
lowered their average menu price by introducing items such as
a 59-cent taco. Taco Bell's traffic was up 14%, and Kentucky
Fried Chicken's was up 13% during the fourth quarter, making
up in volume what was lost with the lower prices, said Joseph
J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Mr. Burry of Kidder Peabody expects PepsiCo's restaurant
business to show a 23% profit gain, to 32 cents a share, for
the year. Next year, he said, restaurant earnings will likely
grow 18%.
   Mr. Romm of First Boston said the Frito-Lay snack division
also helped PepsiCo, with a 5% to 6% growth in volume and
rising overseas profit margins.
   Beer consumption has been rising at a snail's pace in
recent years, but Anheuser-Busch is showing strong volume
gain at year end. Mr. Goldman expects Anheuser-Busch's
fourth-quarter retail sales to rise 6%, compared with 2% or
less for the industry. Meanwhile, shipments to wholesalers
are up by about 14%.
   Analysts are split on whether the surge means that liquor
stores and drinkers are stocking up in advance of a Jan. 1
federal excise tax hike, or simply that the company didn't
make enough beer to satisfy demand this summer.
   Mr. Burry said Anheuser-Busch's sales volumes are still
benefiting from a price cut late last year. Also, Bud Dry may
have added 1.5 million barrels, or nearly 2%, to
Anheuser-Busch's volume, even after accounting for the
drinkers who switched to Bud Dry from other Anheuser-Busch
brands.
   Anheuser-Busch's food division is expected to show
improved results as Eagle snack-food losses decline, but Sea
World, a Florida water park that Anheuser-Busch bought last
year, continues to hurt the company. Analysts said the park
will cost 15 cents a share in earnings dilution this year,
adding that a recession and high gasoline prices won't help
attendance.
   Most analysts see the company posting earnings of 50 cents
a share for the quarter, bringing fiscal-year earnings to
$2.95, up 10% from last year.
   Coors, of Golden, Colo., is expected to report earnings of
anywhere from nine cents a share to 20 cents. Analysts are
unsure if the year-old Keystone beer brand will continue to
pump up sales. George Thompson of Prudential-Bache Securities
said Coors Light, like other light beers, is continuing to do
well, but Coors's total beer sales may have dropped slightly
in the fourth quarter because other Coors brands are
fizzling. Flat earnings are projected for Coors next year.
