   TOKYO -- Toshiyuki Inamura, a member of Japan's House of
Representatives and a cabinet minister for the governing
Liberal Democratic Party until he resigned Wednesday, was
charged with evading taxes on stock profits.
   While the incident is yet another blow to the party's
credibility, it could help Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in a
way: The indictment will remind Japanese voters of an earlier
political stock scandal -- the notorious Recruit Co. affair
of two years ago. Mr. Kaifu is struggling against powerful
party faction leaders who want to give ministerial posts back
to Recruit-tainted politicians in a coming Cabinet shuffle.
Renewed public anger about scandals could provide the
ammunition Mr. Kaifu needs to appoint another slate.

   The Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office alleges that the
55-year-old Mr. Inamura failed to pay taxes of 1.72 billion
yen, or $12.6 million, on profit of 2.88 billion yen, or
$21.1 million, earned in share transactions between 1986 and
1988.
   Mr. Inamura's physician, Akiyuki Yamaguchi, also was
charged with evading 827.9 million yen in taxes in 1986-87,
Chief Prosecutor Yusuke Yoshinaga said. The physician is
charged with channeling inside information to Mr. Inamura
from a third man who is being tried for allegedly
manipulating stock prices.
   Mr. Inamura was minister of state and director general of
the Environment Agency in 1986-87. If found guilty, he could
be fined as much as 3.2 billion yen in back tax and
penalties, officials said.
