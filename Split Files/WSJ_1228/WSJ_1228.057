   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Acuson Corp. said it was ordered
to pay a $6.3 million award plus legal fees and costs as the
result of an arbitrated settlement over a marketing dispute
with Advanced Technology Laboratories, a unit of Westmark
International Inc.
   At the center of the dispute are claims of false and
misleading advertising made by both companies. The Acuson ad
campaign compared the resolution of its ultrasound imaging
with ATL's ultrasound equipment.

   The advertisements appeared in brochures and trade
magazines, said Robert J. Gallagher, Acuson's chief financial
officer.
   "We don't think any award is justified, and we certainly
can't comprehend an award of this size," Mr. Gallagher said.
He said the compay will investigate the arbitration process
to make sure the rules were followed. Because both parties
agreed to accept the decision of the private arbitrator, the
only redress Acuson can seek against the judgment is to find
an irregularity in the process.
   Dennis C. Fill, the chairman and chief executive officer
of Westmark, said he was pleased with the verdict but was
legally enjoined from elaborating on the judgment.
   Mr. Fill said a federal judge in Seattle who approved the
arbitration will review the sales and advertising practices
of both companies.
   Acuson's stock closed at $27, down $1.625 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Westmark stock closed
at $26.25, unchanged in national over-the-counter trading.
