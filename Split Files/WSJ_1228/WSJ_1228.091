   Financial Security Assurance Holdings Ltd. said Tokio
Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. of Japan purchased 9.9% of its
shares in a transaction valued at nearly $49 million. The
financial guaranty insurance company had been wholly owned by
U S West Capital Corp., a business unit of U S West Inc., a
telecommunications company based in Englewood, Colo.
   As part of the agreement, Tokio Marine and Financial
Security Assurance will market financial guaranty insurance
in Japan. Tokio Marine, the largest and oldest
property-casualty insurance company in Japan, also will have
a seat on the Financial Security Assurance board.

   The transaction marks an attempt by both companies to take
advantage of Japan's expanding asset-backed securities
market. The deal also represents the first time that a
Japanese insurer, other than a life insurance company, has
invested in a financial guarantor, a Financial Security
Assurance spokeswoman said.
