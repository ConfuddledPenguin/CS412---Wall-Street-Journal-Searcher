   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government won a contract valued at
600 million Canadian dollars (US$517.3 million) to build a
second nuclear power reactor in South Korea.
   The sale, Canada's first in almost 10 years, is expected
to give a boost to Canada's nuclear industry.

   Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., a government agency, said it
signed a contract with state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp.
to build a 700,000-kilowatt Candu reactor, a Canadian design,
next to an existing Candu power plant in Wolsong.
   Atomic Energy Chairman Robert Ferchat said the sale
demonstrates "that Canada has the leading nuclear technology
in the world." He said the contract will help boost sales of
Candu reactors to other countries with which Canada is
negotiating.
   Engineering work on South Korea's new power station is to
start immediately and the plant is expected to be in
operation by 1997. The cost of the entire power plant is
estimated at C$1.2 billion. About two-thirds of Canada's
C$600 million contract will go to Canadian engineering
companies and manufacturers of reactor parts. The rest will
go to South Korean subcontractors.
   South Korea announced plans last year to proceed with a
second plant at Wolsong, located on the eastern coast. The
country's first Candu reactor has been in operation there
since 1983.
   Canada's energy minister, Jake Epp, said Canada currently
is negotiating a C$100 million contract with South Korea to
provide heavy water for use with the Candu reactor.
   The Candu design uses heavy water as the power plant's
moderator and natural uranium as its fuel. U.S. reactors, by
comparison, use light water and enriched uranium.
   Atomic Energy received its last nuclear plant order in
1981. Earlier this year, Ontario's newly elected socialist
government announced a three-year freeze on nuclear power
plant construction in the province.
   Atomic Energy holds about 6% of the world's nuclear
reactor market, the third-largest share after General
Electric Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. Outside Canada,
there are 12 Candu systems in operation or under
construction.
   South Korea currently has nine nuclear power plants in
operation, which generate about 50% of the country's
electricity. The new plant is needed to meet the country's
rising demand for electricity, which has been growing more
than 14% a year.
