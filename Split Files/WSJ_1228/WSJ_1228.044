   We protest the irresponsible insinuations implicit in your
story "Nigerians Smuggling Heroin in Their Stomachs Pose
Fast-Growing Problem for Federal Agents" (Nov. 16).
   With a combination of questionable and historically
prejudiced DEA statistics, poor investigation and outright
ignorance, you added to the wave of unfair Nigeria-bashing
pervasive among certain elements in the U.S. media who are
quick to judge a country of 125 million people by the work of
a handful.

   To suggest that Nigerians supply 25% of the $15 billion
U.S. heroin market is absurd; to state that 200 Nigerians
bring heroin to the U.S. daily and that Nigerians supply up
to 50% of Washington, D.C.'s, heroin has to be patently
false.
   Pieces like this suggest that the assumption is fine that
any Nigerian at any U.S. airport is carrying heroin until the
contrary is proven. Many Nigerian dignitaries, including the
winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Prof. Wole Soyinka,
and a former head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo, have been
subjected to embarrassing intrusive searches at American
airports.
   When was the last time someone screamed, "American heroin
smugglers . . ." "Italian heroin smugglers . . . etc"? Or are
we to assume that other drug dealers have no nationalities?
If some Nigerians are bad, why must our country suffer so?
