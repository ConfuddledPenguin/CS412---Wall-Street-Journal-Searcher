   Medco Research Inc. said the Securities and Exchange
Commission is conducting "an informal fact-finding inquiry"
involving trading in the company's shares.
   Archie Prestayko, acting president of the Los Angeles
pharmaceutical research concern since last month, said Medco
hasn't yet been informed what trading activity the SEC is
examining. Medco noted that while the inquiry isn't a formal
investigation, the SEC has requested information from the
company and has indicated it will request certain information
from current and former officers and directors.

   In June, three insiders at Medco sold $1.8 million of
shares at a time when the stock was buoyed by hopes for Food
and Drug Administration approval of Medco's Adenoscan heart
drug, takeover rumors and positive press. In August, a
shareholder sued the company, alleging that Medco misled
investors that it might be sold, and that insiders had sold
the company's stock at artificially high prices knowing that
no acquirer had expressed interest.
   Medco said it has formally requested that the SEC
investigate the activities of short sellers in its stock.
