   NEW YORK -- The dollar closed mixed, with the market
leaning gently in favor of buying back the fundamentally
buoyant mark and selling off the war-vulnerable yen.
   Anxiety over the situation in the Persian Gulf, coupled
with apprehension over Soviet politics, acted as safety nets
for the dollar, preventing it from sustaining heavy losses.
The dollar is traditionally seen as a safe investment in
times of turmoil. Year-end demand for dollars also kept the
U.S. currency supported in a sparse post-holiday market.

   But confirmation of the U.S. economy's troubles, as well
as profit-taking, restrained dollar bulls, and made room for
a resurgence of buying interest in the mark.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5255
marks, down from 1.5368 marks late Wednesday in New York. The
U.S. currency was changing hands at 136.40 yen, up from
136.25 yen in New York late Wednesday. Sterling was trading
at $1.8895, up from $1.8823.
   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 136.58
yen.
   The yen weakened broadly, slipping against European
currencies. This trend suggested a market more concerned with
the Mideast crisis than with suggestions of instability in
the Soviet Union, traders said.
   The mark was sold heavily following the resignation of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze late last week,
because the German currency is seen as specially vulnerable
to instability in the Soviet Union, or Eastern Europe in
general. But the worry sparked by the resignation is "not
enough to break the significant mark trends," said Keith
Raphael, second vice president for foreign exchange at Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York. People will concentrate again on
fundamentals, he said, and, when the U.S. economy again
becomes the market focus, the German currency will reassert
its strength.
   Meanwhile, the market is on edge as the Jan. 15 deadline
set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait approaches, with no apparent progress on diplomatic
meetings between Baghdad and Washington. As long as the war
fears exist, the market perceives the yen as vulnerable to a
downward plunge, said Charles Spence, vice president of
foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank of California in
Los Angeles.
   Also helping to firm the dollar, meanwhile, was a fairly
steady amount of last-minute demand for greenbacks, traders
said. Because spot-trading transactions are for delivery two
business days later, transactions made yesterday represented
the last opportunity to book deals in this calendar year.
Japanese importers were particularly active in buying the
dollar in a year-end scramble, traders in Tokyo said. On the
back of this interest, the dollar floated as high as 137.05
yen. There, however, it ran into heavy selling, primarily
from Japanese exporters.
   Sparking a brief dollar sell-off was news that U.S.
durable goods orders tumbled 10.5% in November, matching a
record drop last January and offering further evidence of an
economic downturn. The report caused a knee-jerk flight out
of dollars, but the reaction was short-lived. Because of the
nagging threat of war, it's "very difficult to go short
dollars," said Radhika Govindrajan, vice president at
Chemical Bank in New York.
   Although all three major foreign exchange centers --
Tokyo, London, and New York -- were open Thursday,
participation was slight, with almost no interbank trading
and little activity in the brokers market.
   The Federal Reserve made the unusual move of
pre-announcing one-day system repurchase agreements for
Thursday and two-day system repurchase agreements for Monday.
   The Fed's move could have had a mildly bearish impact on
the dollar if interpreted as a hint of further easing down
the road. But most participants saw the Fed's move as a
technically motivated one, intended to address year-end
liquidity needs and to smooth out what has been a rocky
period. Monday, the federal funds rate, the rate at which
banks lend to each other overnight, drifted as low as 1/16%.
Wednesday night, in an apparent credit panic, the funds rate
pushed the other extreme, soaring as high as 100%. Analysts
said the Fed's move to announce the liquidity-adding steps
was probably an attempt to reassure the market that its needs
would be met and that 7% is still the desired target for the
federal funds rate.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.30 an ounce, down 30 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$385.40 an ounce.
