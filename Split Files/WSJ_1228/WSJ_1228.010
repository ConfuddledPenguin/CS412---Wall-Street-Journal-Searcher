   So who's to blame for the nation's economic funk? How
about lawyers?
   That's what Stephen P. Magee, a University of Texas
finance professor, argues. According to his calculations, the
average lawyer drains $1 million a year from the country's
output of goods and services. And can that add up: The
500,000 U.S. lawyers sap the economy of a half-trillion
dollars, or 10% of the country's gross national product, he
maintains.

   Prof. Magee contends the crux of the problem is
redistribution of wealth created by "litigation-specific
economic predation." (Read that the loss of money to a person
armed with an attorney.) This, he says, is different from
"crime" -- the loss of money to a person armed with a weapon
-- in few material respects.
   Costs of such predation, he maintains, include time wasted
fighting spurious claims; loss of potential engineers,
doctors and executives to the legal profession; and
discouragement of innovation because of excessive
product-liability litigation.
   Prof. Magee apparently isn't worried about a lawsuit. He
divulged his thesis with two co-authors in a book called
"Black Hole Tariffs and Endogenous Policy Theory" and will
refine it in another tome, "The Negative Effect of Lawyers on
the U.S. Economy."
   To support his theory, he offers a statistical study of 34
countries that compares the number of lawyers in each with
that country's GNP for the past 20 years. The analysis
reveals that GNP growth is better in countries with fewer
lawyers per capita, such as South Korea and Japan, than in
those where lawyers proliferate, including India and the U.S.
   Lawyers, naturally, dismiss Mr. Magee's conclusions as "ex
parte," i.e. one-sided. "Res ipsa loquitor," they plead, the
thing speaks for itself.
   "In the past people have resolved disputes by killing one
another in duels," says James McGurk, a Chicago-based
securities lawyer. "Is it wiser to have them defending
themselves with guns than with lawyers?" Besides, says Mr.
McGurk, litigation is the product of legislation -- and laws
are created by Congress. "In other words," he says, "this
system is the will of the people." "Prima facie," before
further examination, that might appear true, allows Mr.
Magee. Yet deeper analysis, he contends, disproves this
defense of the legal profession: Some 62% of U.S. senators
and 42% of U.S. representatives are lawyers.
