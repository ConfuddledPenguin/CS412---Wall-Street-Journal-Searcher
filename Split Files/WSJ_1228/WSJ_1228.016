   PAWLING, N.Y. -- Pawling Savings Bank said it added an
additional $7.5 million to its loan loss reserves in the
fourth quarter, due to continued deteriorating real estate
loan values.
   The addition boosted reserves at year end to approximately
$14.5 million. Reserves at the end of the third quarter
totaled $12.9 million. The bank, the primary subsidiary of
Progressive Bank Inc., said it wrote off about $7 million in
loans in the fourth quarter.
