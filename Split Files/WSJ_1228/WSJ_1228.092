   At its first meeting of shareholders yesterday, Alliance
New Europe Fund Inc., New York, postponed until early next
year a final vote on whether to convert to an open-end
investment company from a closed-end fund.
   A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares that trade
either at a discount or premium to the value of its assets.
An open-end fund issues shares continuously based on investor
demand, and redeems the shares directly from investors who
want to sell.

   The meeting was adjourned until Jan. 10 to allow more time
to receive proxies from shareholders, the company said.
Management's open-end fund proposal requires the support of
75% or more of the shares outstanding for approval. At the
meeting, David H. Dievler, chairman, said 65% of the fund's
shares had voted, and of those, 62% favored converting to an
openend investment company.
