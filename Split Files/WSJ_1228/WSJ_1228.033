   Qume Corp. said write-downs and other unusual costs
totaling $8.4 million resulted in a loss of $12.7 million, or
$1.13 a share, for the third quarter ended Nov. 30.
   In the year-earlier period, the Milpitas, Calif., maker of
computer printers and other peripheral equipment earned $1
million, or nine cents a share.

   The loss reflects the cost of a failed buy-out
transaction, inventory write-downs and other costs, Qume
said.
   The failed buy-out of the company by David S. Lee, Qume's
chairman and chief executive officer, and a group of
investors cost $1.4 million, the company said. For the nine
months ended Nov. 30, buy-out costs were $2 million. Net
inventory declined $10.5 million during the quarter, which
included an inventory write-down of $5.7 million.
   Quarterly revenue dipped 2.3% to $54.7 million from $55.9
million.
