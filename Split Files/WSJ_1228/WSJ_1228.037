   Your Nov. 28 editorial "Scientific Fraud?" discussed a
Soviet scientific presentation made at the National Academy
of Sciences in April 1987 (not 1986 as the editorial states).
It is important to clarify for your readers that the visit of
the Soviet doctors was not an event sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences. Rather, it was privately sponsored by
Matthew Meselson, who is an NAS member. Dr. Meselson was
permitted to hold the Washington session at the NAS,
consistent with academy policy to allow its members to use
academy facilities for scientific meetings. This does not,
however, imply any academy endorsement of the information or
viewpoints expressed in the meetings.
   Neither the academy nor any of its committees have taken a
stand on the veracity of the Soviet doctors' explanation of
the events in Sverdlovsk in 1979. We do, of course, urge and
welcome complete openness from the Soviet Union to address
any lingering concerns regarding past and current Soviet
compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention to which it
is a party.
