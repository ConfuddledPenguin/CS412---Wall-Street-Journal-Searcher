   TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses rose
2.8% to 469,050 units in November from 456,404 a year
earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
said.
   An association spokesman said November exports of
passenger cars to the U.S. rose 5.8% to 167,770 units,
compared with a year earlier, as the introduction of new
models continued to boost results. He said exports to the
U.S. had generally declined through September.

   November's results represented an 8.8% decline from
October exports of 514,581 units. In October, vehicle exports
jumped 11% from year-earlier levels, helped by the yen's
weakness earlier in the year and the introduction of new
models.
   Shipments of passenger cars by Japanese makers rose 4% to
363,093 units from 349,048 a year earlier. Truck exports fell
1.8% to 102,559 units from 104,407. Bus exports increased 15%
to 3,398 units from 2,949.
   The value of Japanese vehicle exports rose 11% to $4.4
billion in November from $4 billion a year earlier,
reflecting the introduction by Japanese makers of
top-ofthe-line luxury models.
   Overall exports to the U.S. rose 3.3% to 196,293 units in
November from 190,099 a year earlier. The association
spokesman said the results suggest the U.S. economy, though
weak, isn't declining sharply.
   Exports by Toyota Motor Corp. rose 3.2% to 127,837 units.
Those by Nissan Motor Co. climbed 9.7% to 84,304 units. And
shipments by Mazda Motor Corp. increased 2.2% to 70,852
units.
