   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it expects to
complete its $66-a-share tender offer for MCA Inc. on
schedule, by 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   The Japanese electronics giant said it doesn't expect to
extend the offer for the Universal City, Calif.,
entertainment concern beyond that date. Barring any
last-minute surprises, the $6.59 billion acquisition
therefore should be completed this year.

   MCA also filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission related to the planned
spinoff of New York-area television station WWOR-TV to its
shareholders as part of the Matsushita acquisition.
   The newly spun-off company, which will be called Pinelands
Inc., rather than Red Oak as originally contemplated, is
expected to have about 16.9 million common shares
outstanding, or one share for every five MCA shares. MCA said
the station had operating cash flow of about $28 million for
the first nine months of 1990, up about 55% from $18 million
for the same period in 1989. Revenue of $141 million was up
18% from $119 million a year ago.
