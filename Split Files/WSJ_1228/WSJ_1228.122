   BRUSSELS -- The Belgian health secretary announced
yesterday he has decided to ban the popular French painkiller
Glifanan, made by Laboratoires Roussel, the Belgian
subsidiary of French group Roussel-UCLAF, from the Belgian
market starting Dec. 31.
   The company announced earlier yesterday that it was
withdrawing the drug, which has been on the market for at
least 13 years.

   A statement from Health Secretary Roger Delizee said other
analgesics Exidol, Glafenic and Nalfogan, which contain
Glafenine like Glifanban, were also banned.
   The statement said Glifanan had been investigated by
Belgian and European drug experts since 1977. It said all
drugs containing Glafenine had been on free sale until 1987,
when experts advised to use them under medical control.
   Although the European Community's drug committee did not
recommend immediate precautions, the statement said, Mr.
Delizee asked Belgian experts to pursue their investigation
in cooperation with the drug makers.
   The investigation was completed in July and led Delizee to
decide the ban on Glafenine.
   A spokesman for Mr. Delizee confirmed press reports that
two people had died from taking Glifanan without medical
advise. The Belgian radio said a hundred other people had
suffered severe secondary effects.
   In France, however, the health ministry did not plan to
ban Glifanan immediately, according to official sources.
