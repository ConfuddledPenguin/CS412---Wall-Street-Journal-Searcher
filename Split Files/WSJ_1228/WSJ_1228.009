   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The government approved regulations
opening Taiwan's stock market to direct investment by foreign
institutions, and fund managers may be able to apply to
invest next week.
   The decision, which is expected to generate widespread
interest despite restrictions on capital movement and
rigorous settlement rules, opens the way for foreign
institutional investors to buy a total of $2.5 billion in
Taiwan shares.

   Approved by a cabinet vote on Thursday, the regulations
are expected to be implemented Friday or Saturday, an
official with Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission
said. Under Taiwan law they will become effective three days
later. At that point, foreigners will be allowed to apply for
investment quotas of between $5 million and $50 million.
   The final rules differ only slightly from the draft
regulations announced in September. They retain restrictions
on capital movement that will prevent many funds from
entering the market because such limitations contravene their
trust agreements. Still, the rule that many foreigners
considered most onerous -- a period in which investment
principal must remain in Taiwan -- has been reduced to three
months from one year.
   Foreign brokers expect substantial interest in Taiwan
shares once the market opens, particularly from Hong Kong,
Japanese and British fund managers. "The response will really
be quite good," says Chris Ruffle, Taiwan representative of
S.G. Warburg Securities. "I recently did a tour, making 60
presentations in three weeks in Hong Kong, Europe and the
U.S., and was pleasantly surprised by the level of interest."
   But brokers say that investors preparing to enter the
market also are girding themselves for the arduous task of
dealing with Taiwan's settlement procedures, which are among
the most demanding in the world. The requirement that all
transactions be settled within 24 hours may prove a
logistical nightmare for fund managers halfway around the
world and may even scare off some institutions.
   The market-opening measure represents a historic step in
the government's efforts to integrate Taiwan's financial
system with global markets. Foreign investors have been able
to invest indirectly in Taiwan shares for several years
through four investment trusts that are listed on the New
York and London stock exchanges. But this will be the first
opportunity for foreign institutions to gain direct access to
the market.
   Government officials hope that foreign fund managers will
help stabilize the volatile Taiwan market by making long-term
investments in shares. But with a current market
capitalization of about $100 billion and the value of trading
averaging between 40% and 60% of that capitalization in
recent months, $2.5 billion in foreign investment isn't
likely to have much impact on the market, many brokers say.
   Among the institutions that will be permitted to apply to
invest in the market will be fund-management companies,
insurance companies, banks and pension funds. The SEC
official said that the only group that will have minimum
capital requirements will be pension funds, which will be
required to have at least $500 million under management.
   Individual funds will be limited to a 5% maximum holding
in a company, while the ceiling on total foreign investment
in a single listed concern will be 10%.
