   Beverly Enterprises Inc. said it completed a $413 million
refinancing of the remaining debt covered by its 1988
restructuring agreement.

refinancing consists of a bank credit facility led by J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co.'s Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York unit, a
senior secured note offering placed by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and Stephens Inc. and a commercial paper program placed by
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., also a J.P. Morgan unit. The
various debt instruments have maturities ranging from three
to seven years. Terms of the debt instruments weren't
disclosed and officials of Beverly couldn't be reached for
further amplification.
