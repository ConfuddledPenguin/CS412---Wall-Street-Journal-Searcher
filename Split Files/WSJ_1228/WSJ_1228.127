   Often, when I return from a sporting event, I'm asked if
it was a "good" one. Sometimes, I'm stumped for an answer.
   I have no problem answering when all the contestants in
the match in question played truly and well. Ditto when they
stunk up the joint. But I and, I'm sure, others, have
difficulty evaluating the more-common situations in which one
player or team performs much better than its opponent.

   The point seems apt when reviewing sports-year 1990. All
three of our major professional team sports ended their
seasons with one-sided championship playoffs, and even the
NCAA basketball tournament, which usually produces a
cliff-hanging finish, followed suit. Did that make 1990 a
bust, competitionwise?
   Not if you are of the half-full persuasion, and chose to
concentrate on the winning side. It's hard to recall a better
football game than that played by the San Francisco 49ers in
trouncing the Denver Broncos, 55-10, in Super Bowl last. The
same goes for the court-singeing, 30-point win over Duke that
the Nevada-Las Vegas Rebels posted in the college hoops
final.
   The Cincinnati Reds surprised everyone, including
themselves, in besting the Oakland Athletics in every facet
of their baseball World Series sweep, and the Detroit Pistons
played their bump-and-grind style of basketball to near
perfection in taking four of five games from the Portland
Trail Blazers for the NBA crown. Certainly, no one in Cincy
or Motown was heard to complain about the brusqueness of
those triumphs.
   To me, though, the best of the year's one-sided victories
-- and one of the two best events I witnessed in 1990 -- was
posted by Pete Sampras in the U.S. Open tennis tournament.
That the 19-year-old won the tourney at all was remarkable,
because he'd never accomplished anything nearly so grand.
What made his performance stand out were the men he defeated
and the way he defeated them.
   His last four matches in the big bowl in Flushing Meadow
were against Thomas Muster, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and
Andre Agassi, who must rank in anyone's Top 10. Young Sampras
didn't just beat them, he blew 'em away with a serve that had
observers straining for historical comparisons. And all the
while, after bad points as well as good, he displayed in his
quizzical half-smile a sweetness of temper that seemed to
have disappeared from the men's game with long pants.
   The Sampras service bears special mention; as everyone who
plays tennis knows, serving well looks much easier than it
is. One might think that height and strength are the key
ingredients, but they aren't -- timing and rhythm are.
   The best server of the 1980s was McEnroe, who stands but
5-foot-11 and is unprepossessing of physique. Sampras is
gangly, so he looks a good bit taller than Mad Mac, but he
outmeasures him by just an inch. And while Mac's service
succeeded mostly because of spin and guile, Sampras whacks
the ball country-style, at 120 or so mph on your radar gun.
But that's just as difficult in its way.
   Ask Sampras how he is able to serve so superlatively, and
he'll tell you he practices long and hard. This, no doubt, is
true, but so do other players with greater apparent physical
gifts. A touch of genius also was involved, as was a
mysterious chemistry of time and place that isn't easily
replicable. He cannot depend on working such magic every time
he steps on court.
   At the Open, though, all parts of Sampras's game were "go"
(he's not a one-dimensional blaster like Roscoe Tanner or
Kevin Curren), and his serve was his coup de grace. He
notched 24 aces in a five-set quarter-final win over Lendl,
and 17 in a four-set semi against McEnroe.
   In the final against Agassi, whose specialty is return of
serve, Sampras struck 13 aces plus numerous others that his
foe barely reached. He surrendered just 17 points in his 13
service games, all of which he won. The set scores were 6-4,
6-3 and 6-2, and the match lasted only about 1 1/2 hours. No
one, however, was heard to ask for a refund.
   My other highlight of the dying year was an
altogether-different sort of contest: Julio Cesar Chavez's
last-round technical knockout of Meldrick Taylor in their
March 17 championship prizefight in Las Vegas. It was a
"good" fight in the classic mold -- fast-paced and
competitive -- and a half-minute before its conclusion it
appeared as though Taylor would be declared the winner on
points. But late in round 12, Chavez floored Taylor with a
straight right, and while Taylor arose before the count of 10
he was waved out by referee Richard Steele. Behind Taylor's
head blinked a ring-post light signaling that the bout was in
its final seconds. Two more seconds and it would have ended.
   I find I have to apologize for liking boxing, sometimes to
myself. It's the sport that needs the most regulation but
gets the least, and the machinations of some of the people
who run it border on the criminal. It is saved by its
participants, who are among the most skillful, best
conditioned and most courageous of men.
   Those adjectives applied equally to champion Chavez and
challenger Taylor that March night. Chavez is an athlete
whose totality exceeds the sum of his parts. Smooth-faced and
boyish, he doesn't look the part of a fighter, and his
celebrity has been hindered by his Mexican nationality and
membership in the off-brand junior welterweight (140-pound)
division. In the ring, though, he's a nightmare foe:
Relentless, indefatigable and hard to hurt. He was unbeaten
in 68 bouts.
   Taylor, from Philadelphia, also was unbeaten, but in 25
goes. He was thicker in the chest and arms than Chavez, and
quicker afoot, too. He used his speed to stay away from
Chavez until he chose to close and flurry, which he did
effectively through round 11.
   If Taylor had chosen to run in the last round, he would
have won on two of the three judges' scorecards. Instead, he
stood and fought, and was staggered by one flush right and
decked by another. But in losing the way he did, he lifted
the fight above the ordinary. One athlete or team, playing
extraordinarily well, can produce a "good" event, even a
memorable one. But it takes two to make one great.
