   CALGARY, Alberta -- Texaco Canada Petroleum Inc. said it
and a partner agreed to acquire certain British Columbia oil
and gas properties from a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., for 100
million Canadian dollars (US$86.2 million).
   Texaco Canada, 78%-owned by Texaco Inc., White Plains,
N.Y., said the planned purchase from Imperial's wholly owned
Esso Resources Canada Ltd. unit is subject to various
conditions and approvals.

   Texaco Canada and Mission Energy Co., a unit of SCEcorp of
Rosemead, Calif., plan to form a joint venture to acquire and
operate the properties, which contain an estimated 300
billion cubic feet of proven or probable natural gas
reserves, and six million barrels of oil or gas liquids,
Texaco Canada said.
   Texaco Canada said the proposed purchase would increase
its share of daily natural gas production by about 20 million
cubic feet and its oil and gas liquids production by 450
barrels. The company currently produces about 7.5 million
cubic feet of gas a day and 1,000 barrels of oil or gas
liquids a day.
   Separately, Texaco Canada said it agreed to acquire for
C$6 million Esso Resources' oil and natural gas rights at 21
exploration properties, covering about 73,000 acres of
undeveloped land, along with an option to drill four
additional prospects and earn rights to a further 18,800 net
acres. All of the exploration properties are in British
Columbia, Texaco Canada said.
   Texaco Canada Petroleum was formed in September 1988 to
hold selected exploration assets that weren't included in the
$4.15 billion sale of Texaco's interest in Texaco Canada Inc.
to Imperial Oil. That transaction received final regulatory
approval in February.
   Imperial Oil is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., New York.
