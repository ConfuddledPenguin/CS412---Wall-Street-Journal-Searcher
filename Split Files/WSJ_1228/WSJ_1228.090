   Westcott Communications Inc. said it holds a 6.38% stake
in Sandy Corp.'s common shares outstanding and may seek to
acquire the company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Carrollton, Texas, specialized broadcasting concern said
it has met on several occasions with Sandy to express its
interest in a combination of the two companys.

   According to the filing, on Sept. 13 Westcott proposed the
merger of itself and Sandy where each Sandy share would be
exchanged for $4.125, subject to certain terms. Subsequent
conversations with representatives of Sandy led Westcott to
believe that certain conditions set forth in its Sept. 13
letters could not be readily satisfied by the company.
   On Dec. 7, Westcott received an unsolicited memorandum
from John Sheehy, a director of Sandy, which Westcott
believes was intended as a basis for new negotiations between
the company and Westcott. Westcott has not responded to such
memorandum and no discussions between Westcott and the
company are currently taking place.
   Westcott purchased 41,400 shares from Dec. 17 to Dec. 24
bringing its total holdings in Sandy to 142,900 shares.
   Sandy, Troy, Mich., is a training company for major
corporations. The company had no comment on the filing.
