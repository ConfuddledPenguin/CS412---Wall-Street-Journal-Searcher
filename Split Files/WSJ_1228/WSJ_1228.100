   Albert Fisher Group PLC of Britain, a food distribution
company, said it bought the European frozen-vegetable and
seafood operations of Campbell Soup Co., Camden, N.J., for
#15 million ($28.2 million).
   Albert Fisher said the purchase covers Campbell's
Freshbake frozen-vegetable operations in Britain and its
seafood operations in Britain and Belgium.

   Campbell's chief executive officer, David Johnson, said,
"This sale results from our strategic decision to focus our
European efforts on branded value-added prepared foods."
Campbell said the sale also is a major step in the
restructuring and divestiture program the company announced
earlier this year.
   Albert Fisher said the acquisition is an important step in
developing the company's European food-processing and
distribution operations. It said Campbell's frozen-vegetable
assets, when combined with Albert Fisher's operations, will
form the largest frozen-vegetable business in Britain. Money
for the purchase came from cash reserves, Albert Fisher said.
