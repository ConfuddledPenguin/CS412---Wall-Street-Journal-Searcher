   NEW YORK -- When smoke forced 60 workers to evacuate two
floors of a Manhattan office building early yesterday
morning, it shut down the nerve center of the U.S. stock
market.
   The Securities Industry Automation Corp. is the generally
unseen computerized engine behind the trading of many
millions of shares on the New York, American and regional
stock exchanges.

   Formed in 1972 through a merger of the data processing
facilities of the New York and American exchanges, the
company processes the stock quotations from all of the
nation's major exchanges. It puts out the consolidated tape
of prices of all exchange-listed stocks, among other
services.
   The stream of price and volume information from the
exchanges on stock trades that are processed by the company
give market makers, specialists and investors the same
information, and therefore an equal chance at bargaining for
stocks.
   When business operates as usual, the company goes
unnoticed. But disruptions such as yesterday's evacuation
emphasize how dependent the nation's stock exchanges are on
computers.
   To prevent such disruptions, the company is completing a
backup facility in downtown Brooklyn. Nearly 60,000 feet of
office space have been developed there to house facilities
similar to the two acres of office space in lower Manhattan
where the company is housed.
   By the middle of next year, enough computers should have
been moved to the Brooklyn facility to provide full backup
service to handle a normal day's trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, said Richard Leyh, executive vice president
and chief of operations. However, a complete backup system
for services to all U.S. exchanges won't be available until
1992, Mr. Leyh said.
   By next summer, he said, the Brooklyn facility should be
able to provide backup for the Big Board's SuperDot system,
which routes member firm's orders to appropriate specialists,
or market makers, and back to member firms. SuperDot accounts
for 80% to 90% of Big Board volume, Mr. Leyh said.
   Some traders complain, however, that until the company can
provide instant backup service, its owners will remain
vulnerable to competition from offshore and other trading
services.
   None of the company's computers were damaged yesterday,
and power wasn't cut off, Mr. Leyh said. Trading was delayed
because New York City environmental officials sealed the
building until tests showed there was no evidence of
contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. The
chemical is often used in electrical transformers like the
one that exploded early yesterday outside the company's Water
Street offices.
