   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. agreed not to write
new insurance policies in New Jersey, a move apparently
designed to save face for both the company and state
insurance regulators, who had demanded a $500 million deposit
from the ailing company as security.
   New Jersey drew sharp criticism from insurance regulators
in other states when earlier this month it gave First
Executive a one-week deadline to post a $500 million deposit
to cover policyholders in the state in the event of any
insolvency, or face a cease-and-desist order barring it from
any new business in the state. New Jersey is one of the few
states without an industry-supported guaranty fund for life
insurance policyholders.

   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the
guiding body for the state insurance agencies, called the New
Jersey action "irresponsible," and officials in California
and New York -- principal overseers of First Executive's two
Executive Life companies -- said they would block any deposit
demand by New Jersey.
   But yesterday's agreement averted any such showdown. "We
sought this agreement as a wise and prudent step to protect
New Jersey policyholders while we assess the financial
strength of the companies," New Jersey's insurance
commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, said.
   First Executive said the move had been "voluntary" on its
part, and that it is "confident" that New Jersey regulators
will find its operating units "financially capable of meeting
all obligations to policyholders of all states." First
Executive's action is somewhat academic, since its Executive
Life units aren't writing much new business anywhere,
according to company filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The New Jersey regulators didn't say how long it might be
before First Executive could resume writing policies in the
state. First Executive said it is confident it will be able
to resume business there, although it pointed out that "New
Jersey has never represented a substantial source of business
for us." Executive Life in California writes about 1.3% of
its nationwide business in New Jersey, covering 12,717
individuals, and the New York company writes about 6.5% of
its business in the state, covering 12,319 individuals.
   The agreement, however, didn't win the favor of the
alliance of state insurance regulators who have been working
together for months to contain the difficulties in First
Executive's insurance operations.
   The agreement "gives the appearance of a face-saving
gesture as opposed to really accomplishing anything," said
Larry Gorski of the Illinois Department of Insurance,
spokesman for the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners group overseeing operations of First Executive.
"There's the possibility that policyholders might become even
more concerned over the situation." The regulators had feared
that New Jersey's attempt might prompt a series of demands by
various states for deposits or other special treatment,
scuttling months of regulatory effort to contain the problems
at First Executive.
   First Executive, parent of Executive Life Insurance Co. in
California and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, fell
victim to plunging junk bond markets and was forced to take
$859 million in writedowns earlier this year.
