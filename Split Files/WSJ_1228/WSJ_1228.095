   Caesars World Inc. said it completed the acquisition of
the 146,718 publicly held common shares of Caesars New Jersey
Inc. that it didn't already own, for about $3.3 million. As a
result, Caesars New Jersey became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Los Angeles-based Caesars World.
   Under the terms of the merger, former public shareholders
of Caesars New Jersey, which owns and operates Caesars
Atlantic City, are entitled to receive $22.25 a share in
cash, without interest.

<TEXT>
   The merger follows a recently completed tender offer by
Caesars World for the common shares outstanding of Caesars
New Jersey that it did not already own. Under the tender
offer, which expired Nov. 30, some 2,029,227 shares were
tendered, and Caesars World increased its holdings to 99% of
shares outstanding in Caesars New Jersey.
   Caesars New Jersey's shares on the American Stock Exchange
will be discontinued and registration of the shares under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be terminated. Caesars
World owns and operates hotels and casinos.
