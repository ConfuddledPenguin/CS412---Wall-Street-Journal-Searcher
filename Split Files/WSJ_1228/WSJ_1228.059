   A number of years ago a writer for a British magazine sat
down to mull over the next decade. Looking back at his
previous predictions, the only thing the writer was
absolutely sure of was that what he had predicted would not
come true.
   Nineteen-ninety was that kind of year. Looking back at my
own work, I see that I thought budget director Dick Darman
was smarter than he's proved to be, Chief of Staff John
Sununu wiser than he's proved, and (regarding Iraq, if not
Congress) George Bush less determined than he's proving.
Other than that it was a pretty good year.

   To the many Washingtonians I nicked during the year, I
offer revenge in the form of the following from a May 11
column:
   "To believe a Bush `sellout' on taxes you have to believe
that he, Chief of Staff John Sununu and Treasury Secretary
Nick Brady are stupid enough to give up their party's best
political issue without solving the budget problem. Only the
White House press corps could really believe this." Profuse
apologies to the White House press corps.
   Or consider the wild optimism contained in a Jan. 5
column: That month's Social Security tax increase, I wrote,
"may be the last tax hike before the tax cuts of the 1990s."
At least I still have nine more years to be vindicated on the
tax cuts.
   In November, I used the word "comfortable" to describe New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's likely re-election -- only days
before he barely squeaked by. I had sensed his trouble, but
lapsed into conventional caution. The lesson: When in doubt,
throw the long ball.
   With that in mind (and atonement behind me), let's move on
to even bolder error in 1991:
                                                                                                       

   The next senior official to leave the Bush administration
will be? (It's fun to start with the easy ones.)
                                                                                                       

   The tax-hike troika -- Messrs. Brady, Darman and Sununu --
show no sign of leaving, much less of contrition. Everyone
says the "long knives" are out for John Sununu, but all that
matters are the short daggers held by George and Barbara
Bush. So far they're sheathed.
   The listing ship at Treasury will try for calm by reducing
the influence of its international undersecretary, David
Mulford, while Dick Darman will rebuild his influence by
privately convincing Rep. Newt Gingrich that he really wants
tax cuts. No, the likeliest departure is HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp, after his pro-growth agenda is dashed against the rocks
of "pay-as-you-go" budgeting. That is, unless Mr. Bush grants
Mr. Kemp's request to be U.S. Trade rep, succeeding the next
Supreme Court nominee, Carla Hills.
                                                                                                       

   The man running the U.S.S.R. a year from now will be?
                                                                                                       

   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov or Russian Republican Boris
Yeltsin are obvious choices. The trick answer is no one,
since the U.S.S.R. will cease to exist. But the best answer
is Mikhail Gorbachev, fronting for the Kryuchkov policies.
                                                                                                       

   Political blame for the deep, painful recession will go
to?
                                                                                                       

   Choose your villain: Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, who denied a capital-gains tax cut; overzealous
keep-me-off-the-Senate-witness-list bank regulators; Bush
administration tax-and-spenders; or steal-the-punch-bowl
central bankers. The answer is none of the above. Washington
will finally get its long-awaited recession and blame it on
Reaganomics. Supply-siders were going to get the blame for
this one even if the recovery had lasted 20 years.
                                                                                                       

   President Bush's most formidable political challenge will
come from?
                                                                                                       

   Discount Mario Cuomo, diminished by New York's budget
implosion, and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, who misjudged his
president's resolve to fight a war. Congressional Majority
Leaders Mitchell and Dick Gephardt will override vetoes, but
the real threat will be the looming New Hampshire
favorite-son primary candidacy of retiring GOP Sen. Gordon
Humphrey. He could win a president-embarrassing third of the
vote.
                                                                                                       

   The new non-Iraq foreign-policy crisis will be triggered
by?
                                                                                                       

   Bet on a refugee diaspora from the Soviet Union over the
Saddam Hussein-inspired murder of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak or
Indo-Pak nuclear-bomb rattling. But the big trouble will be
internal Chinese turmoil after Deng Xiaoping finally joins
the Great Helmsman in the sky. Bet on the family of military
warlord Yang Shangkun.
                                                                                                       

   The domestic political surprise of 1991 will be?
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Bush fails to renominate Alan Greenspan as Federal
Reserve chairman, in favor of a 1992 money-easer; Supreme
Court Justice David Souter stares decisis in the face and
refuses to overturn Roe v. Wade; the Senate gives a mere slap
on the wrist to four of the Keating Five (Alan Cranston is a
sacrificial lame duck), as it rallies to Hawaii Democrat
Daniel Inouye's "everyone does it" defense. The answer is all
of the above.
                                                                                                       

   The rising political star?
                                                                                                       

   House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez, who is chastened
enough by his warning from the Democratic Caucus to demagog
banking reform as a GOP "bailout for the rich."
                                                                                                       

   The falling political star?
                                                                                                       

   Texas Republican Phil Gramm, who tries to mediate between
conservatives and the White House but satisfies neither.
                                                                                                       

   And, of course, Iraq:
                                                                                                       

   The fashion on the right is to predict another Bush
defeat, but I'm a contrarian. The commander in chief is
serious about going to war unless Saddam pulls out of every
last inch of Kuwait; and if there is a war, the U.S. wins in
less than a month. Let's hope that, unlike 1990, this isn't
the triumph of hope over experience.
