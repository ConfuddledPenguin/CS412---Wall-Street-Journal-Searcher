   Congratulations for printing the page-one articles about
Dr. Homes Morton and the Amish/Mennonites in Lancaster
County, Pa., on Sept. 20 and Nov. 18.
   In a world of selfishness, Dr. Morton's work is truly the
epitome of the Hippocratic Oath. Your first article so moved
me that I wanted to donate funds for his work. Unfortunately,
I lost the article but now I have been redeemed. Please tell
your readers that his Clinic for Special Children Inc. is at
P.O. Box 128 in Strasburg, Pa. And thank you again for this
wonderful article on human dedication.
