   Attorneys opposing Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.'s
controversial settlement of 175,000 asbestos claims say they
have been told that the plan may be open to renegotiation.
   The attorneys said an adviser to the federal judge
overseeing the case approached them about the possible
renegotiation. In return, the attorneys were asked to
withdraw their appeals and drop plans to ask the judge to
remove himself from the case, said Frederick Baron, an
asbestos plaintiffs' attorney in Dallas.

   Mr. Baron and other plaintiffs' attorneys have claimed
U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn overstepped his
authority by approving the $505 million settlement earlier
this month. They claim the judge doesn't have the power to
order a mandatory class action for cases in other
jurisdictions, and that the settlement was reached without
the participation of attorneys actually representing asbestos
victims.
   Mr. Baron said he was contacted by Leon Silverman, a
special adviser to Judge Weinstein in negotiating a recent
restructuring of the Manville asbestos personal-injury trust.
Mr. Baron said he was told by Mr. Silverman that an
arrangement could be made to renegotiate the settlement if
the attorneys dropped their challenges against Judge
Weinstein.
   "He told us maybe we could cut a better deal" with the
company, Mr. Baron said.
   As part of the proposal, Eagle-Picher would also drop a
racketeering suit it filed against Mr. Baron and two other
plaintiffs attorneys, Mr. Baron said. The suit accuses the
attorneys of "malicious prosecution" in an effort to put
Eagle-Picher into involuntary bankruptcy earlier this month.
   Mr. Silverman confirmed that he has spoken to the
attorneys about the Eagle-Picher litigation, but said he was
acting as a volunteer. "No one has invited me," he said.
"This is not being done under the aegis of Judge Weinstein."
   Mr. Silverman declined to comment on what he suggested to
the attorneys, and he stressed that he has no official role
in the Eagle-Picher case. The Eagle-Picher settlement and Mr.
Silverman's work on the Manville case are considered
important steps in Judge Weinstein's plan for grappling with
asbestos litigation nationwide.
   Eagle-Picher declined to comment. Judge Weinstein's office
also declined to comment.
   Mr. Baron said he isn't willing to withdraw his appeal of
the Eagle-Picher settlement. He said a motion to have Judge
Weinstein removed from the litigation may be made next week.
   Ronald Motley, another plaintiffs' attorney contacted by
Mr. Silverman, said, "It is not my practice to comment on
settlement negotiations."

   PENNSYLVANIA HIGH COURT to decide if caller ID service
invades privacy.
   The state supreme court will be the first in the nation to
decide whether the service, which allows customers to view
phone numbers of incoming calls, should be banned on privacy
grounds. The outcome will have broad implications; phone
companies across the country are lining up to offer the
service to residential customers.
   Last May, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled that Bell of
Pennsylvania's Caller ID Service violated state wiretap laws
and constitutional provisions protecting privacy. Ruling in
favor of the state Consumer Advocate's office and privacy and
civil rights groups, the court overturned a decision by the
state Public Utilities Commission allowing the Bell Atlantic
Corp. unit to offer the service, so long as certain agencies,
including police and shelters for abused women and children,
were able to block transmission of their numbers.
   The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that the service
violates the state's ban on so-called trap and trace devices
and said the service is illegal whether or not customers can
block transmission.
   The supreme court is not expected to rule before next
spring.

   FOUR MEN CONVICTED of laundering drug money in
jewelry-store scheme.
   A federal jury in Los Angeles convicted the four men of
laundering $350 million in Colombian drug profits through
companies doing business in the city's jewelry district.
Charges were still pending against a fifth defendant
yesterday.
   Three of the defendants, brothers Nazareth and Vahe
Andonian, and Juan Carlos Seresi, were also found guilty of
conspiring to launder money in the scheme, which involved
shipments of drug money to jewelry shops owned by Messrs.
Andonian and others. The money was then deposited in
California banks. Subsequently, funds were wired to South
America. The fourth man convicted was gold dealer Raul Silvio
Vivas, the alleged mastermind of the scheme.
   The convictions grew out of a 13-month investigation that
the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles called "the largest
drug-money laundering investigation ever conducted by U.S.
law enforcement agencies." The trial set a record as the
longest criminal trial in Los Angeles federal court.
   Attorneys for the defendants couldn't be reached for
comment.

   IRAN-CONTRA prosecution team joined by former deputy
solicitor general.
   Andrew Frey will join the Iran-Contra special prosecutor's
office as chief appellate counsel responsible for the appeal
of John Poindexter and the continuing proceedings in the case
against Oliver North. Mr. Frey succeeds Gerard Lynch, who is
now chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan.
   Mr. Poindexter is appealing his April conviction on
charges related to the concealment of secret Reagan
administration dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan
insurgents. Mr. North's May 1989 conviction on charges
related to the Iran-contra affair was set aside by an appeals
court in July.
   The special prosecutor is expected to appeal the North
ruling to the Supreme Court.
