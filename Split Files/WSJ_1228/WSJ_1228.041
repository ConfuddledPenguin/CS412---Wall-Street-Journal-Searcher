   TOKYO -- Japan's steel exports in November fell 5.7% to
1,356,000 metric tons from a year earlier, marking a
continuing decline as manufacturers struggled to meet strong
domestic demand, Japan's Iron and Steel Federation said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   Export prices for the month soared to $818 a ton, climbing
above the $800 level for the first time in history. A
federation official said the surge indicates that a large
part of exports consists of expensive items such as seamless
pipes and galvanized iron products.
   Aside from such profitable, high value-added items,
"Makers have completely shifted to domestic demand-oriented
production," the official said.
   Reflecting continued expansion of the Japanese economy,
orders from domestic auto makers, construction companies,
industrial machinery makers and shipbuilding firms remained
at "an extremely high level," he said.
   While domestic steel production is expected to mark a
record high in 1990, steel exports for the year are likely to
drop to the lowest level in 20 years, the official said.
   By market, exports to the U.S. posted their first
year-to-year gain in six months, up 8.2% at 237,000 metric
tons, helped by increases in exports of seamless pipe and
other oil drilling-related products, the official said.
   Exports to the Soviet Union continued to improve, though
the total amount remained small. Exports rose 15% to 40,000
tons, as shipments of oil-drilling products resumed, after
price negotiations between producers and the Soviet
government were successfully concluded earlier this year.
