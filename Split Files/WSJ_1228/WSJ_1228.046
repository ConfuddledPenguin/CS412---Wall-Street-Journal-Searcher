   WASHINGTON -- Three brands of dental adhesive contain
unacceptable levels of benzene, according to the Food and
Drug Administration.
   The three products are Orafix Special and Brace, made by
Norcliff Thayer, a Philadelphia unit of Britain's SmithKline
Beecham PLC, and Cushion Grip, made by Schering-Plough
HealthCare Products, a unit of Schering-Plough Corp.,
Madison, N.J.

   All three products will be voluntarily recalled by their
manufacturers, the FDA said in a statement released late
yesterday. Meanwhile, the agency is urging consumers not to
use the dental adhesives until the manufacturers resume
manufacturing them without benzene.
   Although benzene causes cancer when ingested in large
amounts, James Benson, FDA deputy commissioner said, "We
don't see this as a significant health issue at this point."
But he added that "any time you have something that's a known
or potential carcinogen you want to get rid of it."
   While SmithKline called the levels of benzene
contamination "minute" and "measured in parts per million,"
it was sufficient to warrant an immediate recall.
   A spokesman for Schering-Plough said that the company
"believes the trace concentrations do not pose a health
hazard." But he said the company would cooperate with the FDA
to revise the manufacturing process.
   The amount of benzene found in the three dental adhesive
products exceeds levels that were found by the FDA in Perrier
earlier this year. The result was a highly publicized recall
of Perrier by its French manufacturer, Source Perrier S.A.
Perrier returned to grocery shelves this past July after the
company altered its production process.
   The FDA also found low levels of benzene in Fasteeth and
Fixodent, two dental adhesive products manufactured by
Richardson-Vicks Inc., Shelton, Conn., and said that it would
work with the company to reformulate them. But the agency
said the benzene level in these products didn't pose a
significant health risk, noting that most people consume more
benzene daily in their drinking water. A company spokesman
couldn't be reached for comment.
