   DALLAS -- McDuff Electronics &amp; Appliances Supercenters, a
division of Tandy Corp. of Fort Worth, has agreed to pay a
$15,000 fine and refrain from making misleading advertising
claims.
   In a complaint brought by the Texas attorney general's
office, McDuff was accused of advertising sales in which
products were priced as little as 0.10 of a percentage point
below the normal price. "If you advertise a sale, the
discount must be at least 10% less than the normal price,"
said Assistant Attorney General Steve Gardner.

   Among other practices, McDuff was also accused of calling
certain prices "the lowest of the year" when they were equal
to prices before and after the sale.
   Although the company didn't admit to any wrongdoing in
accepting the final judgment, it accepted a list of
restrictions on its advertising practices and agreed to
provide proof it is conforming with the judgment until the
end of 1992.
   In its ads McDuff must make clear all wording that
indicates a sale and must include a prominent explanation of
its pricing policy when using the legend "Nobody Undersells
McDuff." The $15,000 fine is intended to reimburse the
attorney general's office for its investigative costs.
   McDuff president Victor J. Sholis referred comment to a
spokesman, who didn't return telephone calls.
