   Dynatronics Laser Corp. said a shipping delay in two new
product lines will cut profit in the second quarter, ending
Monday, to near break-even.
   In the year-ago quarter, the medical devices company
earned $92,696, or one cent a share, on sales of $1.6
million.

   The delay of the product lines -- medical rehabilitation
exercise equipment and software -- until after the start of
the new year was caused by extended field tests and the
shortage of parts, company officials said in Salt Lake City.
   The company cited increased expenses and reduced sales
caused by the delay as reasons for lower-than-expected
second-quarter financial results.
