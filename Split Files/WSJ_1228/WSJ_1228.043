   Trying to Unload
   Homes With a Past

   LEONARD Rinallo may have the toughest real-estate job in
the nation: He's trying to sell 236 abandoned homes in the
Niagara Falls, N.Y., area known as Love Canal, which became a
national symbol of environmental contamination in the 1970s.
   Years of toxic-waste dumping by Hooker Chemical, now part
of Occidental Petroleum, led the state to buy and evacuate
230 homes in 1978. In 1980, state and federal authorities
formed the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency, to buy out
500 more homeowners on the perimeter. Since then, about 350
homes have been demolished, and the canal itself has been
sealed off.
   Mr. Rinallo's challenge is to find buyers for the houses
left standing, at prices of $48,000 to $81,000, roughly 20%
less than similar houses in nearby neighborhoods, he says.
Because the homes sat vacant for a decade, up to $20,000 of
renovations have been made on each.
   "We're selling homes that were never proven contaminated,
that were taken out because of the panic," says Mr. Rinallo.
   Since the homes went on sale in August, 15 have gone to
contract, he says. But only one has sold. "The banks are
redlining," Mr. Rinallo says. "They aren't taking {mortgage}
applications, and they aren't telling us why."
   James E. Carr, the agency's planning director, says, "The
banks won't lend because they won't be able to sell {the
mortgages} on the secondary market." Many mortgage
repurchasers, he says, worry about selling homes or being
liable for further cleanup in the event of foreclosures. The
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the State of New York
Mortgage Agency are among the agencies that haven't agreed to
repurchase the mortgages.
   Maurice Hinchey, chairman of the state Legislature's
environmental conservation committee, says selling the homes
seems "a foolhardy thing to do. The banks are understandably
reluctant to get involved."
   Mr. Carr argues that Love Canal "is the most-tested area
in the nation." He adds that the homes have received a clean
bill of health from state and federal environmental
authorities.
   Still, six environmental groups have filed suit to block
the resettlement, challenging the government claims that the
site is safe.
                                                                                                       

   Smaller Japanese Banks
   Fund Purchases in U.S.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S largest institutional investors have a diminished
appetite for U.S. real estate this year, but a new wave of
investment from customers of Japan's regional banks has kept
Japan the No. 1 foreign purchaser of American real estate.
   The plunge of Japan's stock market has hurt the capital
bases of the nation's largest banks, says Jack Rodman of the
Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. Japan's
regional banks, however, are not as heavily invested in
stocks. In addition, their clients are flush with cash due to
soaring land values outside of Japan's largest cities.
   These new buyers are broadening their horizons beyond
Hawaii, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. Of 60 U.S.
properties acquired by Japanese investors in the first nine
months of 1990, 39 were located in the West, 10 in the Middle
Atlantic states, three in the Midwest, five in the Southwest
and three in the South, according to the U.S. real-estate arm
of France's Banque Indosuez.
   Buyers are also steering clear of "trophy" properties.
Thirty-five of the deals were valued at less than $50
million, and only one -- Pebble Beach resort -- topped $200
million, the report says.
   Mr. Rodman estimates that Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate this year will total $10 billion to $13 billion, down
from $14.8 billion in 1989.
                                                                                                       

   Will `Wealth Effect'
   Become Poverty Effect?
                                                                                                       

   SOME ECONOMISTS worry that the erosion of home values will
damp consumer spending, further undermining the national
economy.
   They derive this scenario from the "wealth effect," which
holds that for every $1 drop in a consumer's net worth,
consumption falls by three to six cents.
   In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, doomsayers
cited the wealth effect to support dire economic forecasts.
But the middle class was unfazed by the crash, in part
because only 20% of all households own stock.
   University of Michigan economist F. Thomas Juster says
preliminary data from 1984 to 1989 suggest that housing
capital gains and losses directly affect savings, which in
turn affect consumption. When home values slide, homeowners
save more and buy less.
   Older homeowners are particularly prone to such behavior,
because home equity often represents the largest portion of
their wealth, says Daniel McFadden, an economics professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                                                                                                       

   Real-Estate Pros' Pay
   Follows Market South
                                                                                                       

   THE PAY of top real-estate executives plunged this year,
according to a survey by Ferguson Partners, a Chicago
consulting firm.
   Among the biggest losers: real-estate department heads at
big investment banks (off 20%) and big commercial banks (off
25%), and CEOs of commercial mortgage banks (off 20%).
   Nevertheless, department heads at major investment banks
remained the No. 1 wage earners, with average base salaries
of $250,000, plus a bonus of 100% to 200% of their salaries.
Major pension fund advisers boasted the second-highest
compensations, with average base pay of $225,000, plus a 100%
bonus.
   William Ferguson, managing partner of Ferguson Partners,
predicts that in the coming year, base salaries in virtually
all sectors of real estate will remain unchanged or decline
slightly.
