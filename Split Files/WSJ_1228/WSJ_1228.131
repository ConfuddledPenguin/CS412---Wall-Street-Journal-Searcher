   NEWTON, Mass. -- Elena Bonner, visitor from a dissolving
empire, sits in a pink-walled living room citing lines from a
pamphlet entitled "KONSTITUTIA." But this constitution is not
one of many drafts circulating in Moscow's winter democracy
debate. It is not one of the programs advanced by, say, the
independence movement of a Baltic state. It is the 1978
constitution, a relic from the reign of Leonid Brezhnev.
   That the Soviet Union's most venerable dissident should
choose to quote lines from her great oppressor is
significant. Ms. Bonner is not glorifying the regime that
stashed her away with her late husband, Andrei Sakharov, for
years of KGB-isolation in the town of Gorky. She is recalling
Brezhnev to make a point: that the Soviet Union's current
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, is actually moving away from
democracy and removing what vestiges of law do exist from the
Soviet Union.

   To many Western observers, last week's resignation of
Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze seemed a shock --
and one that foreshadowed political and military crackdown.
To Ms. Bonner, the resignation was no surprise. "In the
Soviet Union," she says, "the coup has already happened."
   A visit with with the 68-year-old Ms. Bonner in her
daughter's suburban house is a lesson in how backward
Washington's Soviet policy seems from Moscow. This past month
President Bush has released at least $1 billion in
agriculture credits in the name of aiding a hungry and
reforming Soviet Union. Such bounty, Ms. Bonner says, "may
improve the situation of a very few people for a very short
period. But it will not improve the program for long-term
change -- at all." That the Soviet leader assigned the KGB to
distribute the emergency food is proof of that.
   What's worse, says Ms. Bonner, is that the West seems
willing to overlook Mr. Gorbachev's power-mongering in the
hope that he will use that new power to end food lines and
domestic chaos. What America is really doing though, she
thinks, is reinforcing "Gorbachev's transition to
dictatorship." Ms. Bonner trained as a medical doctor, and
she doesn't want to promote suffering. Perhaps though, she
says, the world would do better to send food this winter to
starving Africa -- "in my country, there isn't enough food
because the leadership doesn't want political reform."
   With her daughter Tatiana interpreting and a photo of her
late husband framed at her right elbow, the bespectacled Ms.
Bonner undertakes a careful review of Mr. Gorbachev's
half-decade-long abuse of the law. Years ago, he widened his
own powers as president without a popular vote -- an abuse
which the West has honored, ironically, by referring to him
as "President Gorbachev." She points with hand and cigarette
to Article 72 of the Brezhnev constitution, which reads:
"Every union republic retains the right of free secession
from the Soviet Union." That bit of law was ignored last
spring, when Mr. Gorbachev refused Lithuania independence.
(It may be, Ms. Bonner adds mischievously, that President
Bush didn't protest because he didn't know about this part of
the constitution). Now, Mr. Gorbachev has broadened his
powers again so that he controls all slots in his cabinet.
   Ms. Bonner is taking this time off from a holiday trip
because she thinks America's citizens just don't understand
how wrong their president is. The comparison may be rough,
she says, but Mr. Gorbachev is like another leader who first
sided with democrats, then crowned himself emperor Napoleon.
He has changed the Soviet constitution so often, she says,
that "his name should be in the Guinness Book of World
Records."
   Ms. Bonner isn't really being fair to Mr. Gorbachev on
this last point -- Soviet leaders from Lenin to Chernenko had
already fiddled their constitution some 100 times before Mr.
Gorbachev got to it. Indeed, that she, the widow of Andrei
Sakharov, should be so vehement in an attack on Mikhail
Gorbachev may at first glance seem odd. When he came to
power, Mr. Gorbachev did much to improve the lot of political
dissidents -- people who, like the Sakharovs, suffered KGB
hounding, force feeding and persecution that lasted years on
end. In the Sakharovs' case, Mr. Gorbachev actually
telephoned the couple personally to announce the end of their
Gorky exile. (The publicity-minded leader had a phone
installed especially for the event). Mr. Gorbachev has also
moved forward on another major Sakharov goal-free emigration.
   But there is consistency to Ms. Bonner's work. In the
1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she and
nuclear-physicist-turned-rebel tried to hold their regime
accountable to its own laws -- however pointless this seemed.
Sakharov died a year ago, and now she is doing the same thing
-- alone. Mr. Gorbachev, she points out, may have made
concessions on human rights, but he has not given such rights
any basis in law.
   What should the West do next? Not, says Ms. Bonner, fear
that Mr. Shevardnadze's departure means the Soviet Union will
stop supporting the U.S. on Iraq. "Until he gets all the aid
he wants, Gorbachev will keep the same line and save face."
Worry instead, she advises, about the civil strife --
including violent military strife -- as Soviet republics
fight for freedom. Ms. Bonner herself thinks general strikes
may be the best way to spur change.
   To fight for that change, this longtime emigration-rights
campaigner will herself return home to her Chkalova Street
apartment in Moscow. On her husband's birthday in May, she
plans a congress on the future of the Soviet Union. She is
concerned about the Soviet Union's future -- but does she
think Mr. Gorbachev and his regime will take back East
Europe?
   "Ha]" says Elena Bonner in a lively moment and laughs.
"No." He and the military are too corrupt and too weak for
that. As for the republics at home, she thinks reversal isn't
really possible there either. "No," she says again, shaking
her gray ponytail. "Things have gone too far."
