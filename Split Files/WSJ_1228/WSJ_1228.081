   As the days of Fidel Castro's rule seem numbered, and as
Cubans both on the island and in exile become increasingly
excited about the future, the figure of one exile as
spokesman and symbol, human rights activist and guarantor of
honesty, still looms large. Just as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's
personal and historical accounts of the Soviet gulag drew the
world's attention to that country's systemic horrors, so has
Armando Valladares's prison memories -- compiled in his
moving 1986 book "Against All Hope" -- unveiled to the world
the reality of Mr. Castro's tropical gulag.
   Mr. Valladares, 53, a handsome, charismatic poet and human
rights activist, has been living in Madrid since his release
from prison eight years ago. He had been incarcerated by
Fidel Castro for 22 years. One lasting effect of torture is
that he cannot have children (he and his Cuban-American wife
have adopted three Spanish children), but otherwise his
slender build appears remarkably strong and fit. Speaking
Spanish in a hoarse voice that he has had since childhood, he
explains, "In jail, in the worst physical situation, even
during the hunger strikes, even when I was beaten senseless,
or tied with feeding tubes, I would do daily exercises, even
if it was only moving my hands and feet. I knew that survival
required self-discipline."

   Mr. Valladares, who in 1987 was named U.S. ambassador to
the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations in Geneva,
describes his greatest achievement at the U.N. as the
adoption this year of a 400-page report on the violation of
human rights in Cuba: "My objective in accepting the
ambassadorship was to put Mr. Castro on trial before world
opinion, because apologists for the regime attacked my book
as a fabrication. But the commission's report went into
greater detail and documented even worse torture and summary
executions than I witnessed." As to those who criticize him
for allowing the U.S. to use him, he answers that it is he
who has used the U.S. to achieve his goals before a world
audience.
   Too idealistic to be a politician, too impassioned to be a
diplomat, too much his own man to be a bureaucrat, it comes
as no surprise that Mr. Valladares is leaving the U.N. in
order, as he says, "to give myself more freedom of action."
(For instance, as U.S. ambassador, he cannot protest the
award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Mikhail Gorbachev.)
   Yet he believes that in the new post-Cold War era, the
U.N. will have a major role to play in shaping Cuba's future.
He predicts that the General Assembly will pass resolutions
condemning Mr. Castro's violations of human rights, further
isolating him from the world community. This explains, in his
view, why Cuba is one of the few states to refuse to condemn
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait: "Fidel identifies himself with
Saddam Hussein; Fidel lies awake at night, jealous of
Saddam's power."
   Mr. Valladares believes that the linchpin to the collapse
of Fidel Castro's dictatorship is the same economic crisis
that has rocked communist regimes in Europe. He worries that
an international effort of socialists in Venezuela, Sweden
and Spain will provide economic aid to Mr. Castro in the
false hope of enticing greater liberalization on the island.
In his view, "Economic aid would only prolong the agony of a
regime that has lost all legitimacy."
   Prison was a long road through hell for Mr. Valladares. It
was in prison that he started writing poetry; there that he
wrote and rewrote in his head entire passages of his memoirs.
"I needed to convert all that horror, the suffering, the
screams into something useful, so I began to compose poems
and short stories."
   Does he still write poetry? "No, not enough," he answers.
"But I am a poet and will die a poet. Right now I have made a
pledge to myself to help rid my nation of dictatorship; when
that is done, I will paint, I will write about things that
have nothing to do with communism."
   Most of his work these days revolves around the Valladares
Foundation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and Resistance
International, which he co-founded with Vladimir Bukovsky in
1983. Both groups are dedicated to exposing those human
rights abuses around the world that, he claims, the press
traditionally overlooked: "I was the victim of a double
standard -- people protested abuses in Chile and South
Africa, but were silent about Cuba. I never want to let that
happen again."
   Today he takes pains to denounce those dissidents inside
Cuba and outside who are ready to participate in "false
elections" manipulated by Mr. Castro to keep himself in
power: "This is a distinct minority; some of these people are
well-intentioned innocents, some are dupes, and still others
are infiltrated stooges and agents of Fidel." Those
dissidents who desire a dialogue with Mr. Castro have
attacked Mr. Valladares for wanting to precipitate Cuba into
civil war. "This is dishonest," counters Mr. Valladares.
"Castro is using the threat of a bloodbath on the island to
scare people. But colonels, junior officers and new party
cadres have witnessed communism change in Eastern Europe
without bloodshed, and this apres nous le deluge view of
Castro's has little appeal to the younger generation."
   Clearly, Mr. Valladares is happier with a pen at a desk,
than becoming embroiled in the grubby political infighting of
rival exile groups. But his personal attractiveness and
fearlessness make him a figurehead that many Cuban
politicians try to coopt for their own aims. While there is
always a risk that he will be manipulated by others with far
less noble aspirations than he, he makes no claims to
personal political ambitions: "I have no intention of
becoming the Vaclav Havel of Havana. I want finally to enjoy
a private life with my family -- without bodyguards and
without fear."
   Mr. Valladares's main aim is not political, but moral:
"What I want is to see a world in which the dignity of the
individual will be more important than any political concern
whatsoever."
   He repeats this to make certain it is clear and
understood. "Human dignity must be respected above all." So
when it comes time to settle scores in Havana, when the huge
capital of the exile community, the drug traffickers, the
politicians with axes to grind finally bury Mr. Castro's, Mr.
Valladares plans to take a well-deserved rest. But he may not
have this luxury; there is a tradition in Latin American
politics that looks to poets to embody the people's
aspirations, and carry the soul of the nation because they
are not easily corruptible. Jose Marti, the hero of the Cuban
independence struggle, was also a poet and a dreamer.
