   American Airlines won a temporary restraining order
barring its pilots union from instigating or participating in
a sickout or other work slowdowns.
   The order, from U.S. District Judge John McBryde in Fort
Worth, Texas, comes amid a protracted contract dispute
between the Allied Pilots Association and American, a unit of
AMR Corp., Dallas. The airline alleged the union has been
waging a job action, which would be illegal under special
provisions of labor law that apply to airline workers.

   The union has vigorously denied such allegations before. A
spokesman yesterday reiterated that position. "It won't be
difficult for us to comply with the court order. We haven't
been doing anything illegal in the first place," he said.
   American contends heightened levels of sick leave have
been worsening operating problems at the carrier caused by
pilots being called up for military duty in Saudi Arabia.
This drain has reduced American's flexibility to respond to
pilot absences. As a result, the carrier will cut flight
schedules by about 4% beginning in February, according to
R.W. Baker, executive vice president of operations, in an
interview.
   Planning under a "worst-case assumption," Mr. Baker said
he figures 450 of American Airlines' 9,000 pilots could be
lost evenutally to the military, up from 250 currently.
   Meantime, the airline has assumed that "sick time at these
high levels will continue," Mr. Baker said. The executive
said that the number of pilots calling in sick climbed
steadily from early December, when about 323 were out, to 524
yesterday. "We would have expected something in the range of
300" based on historical patterns, he said.
   Harsh weather in the days preceding the Christmas holiday
at four of the six cities integral to American's route system
exacerbated the difficulties, he added.
   All these factors led the airline to seek the restraining
order Wednesday night, though Mr. Baker said American had
been preparing its court filing of more than 200 pages for at
least three months.
   In his order, Judge McBryde said that he granted the
request because the airline "is likely to prevail on the
merits of its claims," and that the "disruptive activity"
could "cause American Airlines to suffer a substantial loss
of revenue and passenger goodwill which it can never
recover."
   The judge scheduled a Jan. 3 hearing on American's request
for a preliminary injunction. The temporary order lasts
through Jan. 5.
   Although American's pilots have been working without a
contract since Dec. 30, 1989, they are forbidden from work
slowdowns, strikes and other actions under the Railway Labor
Act. The law, which applies to airlines and their labor
groups, requires a prolonged series of actions before airline
unions can act outside negotiations.
   First, if the two sides can't agree, they can petition for
a federally appointed mediator, who in this dispute was
called in last spring. In fact, there were talks as recently
as last Friday, and another round is scheduled for Jan. 7,
Mr. Baker said.
   If the two sides still can't agree, they can be declared
at an impasse and enter a 30-day, cooling-off period. Only if
that period ends without a new contract is the union free to
strike and the company to impose whatever work rules and pay
it chooses.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AMR shares closed at $48.375, down 50 cents.
