   STOCKHOLM -- The restructuring of Sweden's defense
industry continues, with an announcement that Nobel
Industrier Sverige AB and Foerenade Fabriksverken, the
state-owned arms maker known as FFV, agreed to pool most of
their defense-related operations under a new jointly owned
company.
   The new company, to be called Swedish Ordnance-FFV/Bofors
AB, will begin operations Tuesday with 6,000 employees and
estimated annual sales of five billion Swedish kronor ($873
million). Nobel's AB Bofors unit has long been Sweden's
biggest defense contractor. Swedish Ordnance will control
virtually all arms output except the manufacture of military
aircraft and engines by Saab-Scania AB and AB Volvo.

   The Nobel-FFV accord reflects swift consolidation among
Swedish defense contractors in recent years. Sweden's
military has cut back spending, and international competition
has intensified on the limited number of export markets open
to defense contractors under Sweden's tight arms export
controls.
   During the past 18 months, Nobel has acquired the defense
electronics operations of the Swedish unit of N.V. Philips
and formed a military electronics venture with Telefon AB
L.M. Ericsson. Last month, FFV and Volvo's aircraft engine
unit combined their military aircraft maintenance operations
under a company 51% controlled by Volvo.
   FFV and Bofors have been talking for months about merging
their operations.
   Anders Carlberg, Nobel's chief executive, cited missile
production -- where Bofors competes head on with
Saab-Scaniaas virtually the only remaining defense sector
where costly duplication could be eliminated.
   The Nobel chief said that no talks are under way with
Saab-Scania or are likely to begin soon.
