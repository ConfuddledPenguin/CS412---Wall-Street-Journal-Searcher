   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the congressional Joint
Economic Committee urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest
rates further to assure that the recent budget agreement
doesn't worsen the economic slowdown.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, (D., Ind.) said Congress should stick
with the agreement. Some lawmakers have suggested at least
considering breaking the agreement, which raised taxes and
cut spending in order to narrow the deficit by $500 billion
through 1995. The idea would be to pass new programs or cut
taxes to ease the effects of the downturn -- even though
doing so would increase the deficit. In fact, under the
agreement, if the government officially forecasts a recession
-- two consecutive quarters of decline in output of goods and
services -- lawmakers would have to consider setting the
budget agreement aside.

   "I'm afraid any such stimulation of that sort would only
aggravate our problems," Mr. Hamilton said at a news
conference. He said scrapping the budget pact would "make the
credibility {problems} of the budget deficit agreement even
greater, and complicate life for the Fed in trying to ease
monetary rates."
   Mr. Hamilton, who was delivering an annual report on the
economy, said the Fed should cut short-term interest rates at
least another one-quarter of a percentage point just to
offset the chilling effects of the deficit-reduction
agreement.
   The congressman said hewing to the budget agreement would
be the best thing Congress and the Bush administration could
do to give the Fed leeway to cut rates.
   Mr. Hamilton said, however, that he believes the
government should extend unemployment benefits, as it has
done in previous recessions, "in order to cushion the human
costs." Unemployment benefit programs, which are operated by
both the federal government and the states, have been cut
back across the country in recent years. The proportion of
unemployed people receiving benefits has dropped from about
50% 10 years ago to about 33% today as requirements have
toughened.
   Mr. Hamilton said he believes the unemployment rate, which
was at 5.9% in November, could reach 8% during this
recession. He didn't offer a specific proposal for increasing
benefits, but the budget agreement allows increases in
spending if they are matched by spending cuts elsewhere.
   Mr. Hamilton said he favors looking for further ways to
reduce the deficit when the economy picks up. He said he is
concerned that the current package won't cut the deficit
enough to raise the national savings rate to its level during
the 1960s and 1970s.
   "Fully restoring the level of savings will require an
additional $80 billion of budget savings in fiscal year '95,"
Mr. Hamilton said. He didn't offer any specific budget cuts,
but he said "we will need either further spending cuts, or we
will need another package deal" including tax increases.
