   PHILADELPHIA -- In today's dismal banking climate, it
might seem safe to assume nobody is starting a new bank. But
the assumption would be wrong.
   As big old banks wring their hands and slash dividends,
scores of small new banks are opening their doors. With
credit tightening, these institutions and other small banks
are attracting family-owned businesses hungry for cash and
personal service.

   In Pennsylvania, 28 banks have opened since 1987, compared
with just six banks in the prior 20 years, state banking
regulators say. Bank formations also have been increasing in
Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and New Jersey.
Nationally, new bank charters have ranged between 200 and 300
a year for the last six years.
   "Mergers of small banks into large banks tend to lead to
an increase in the number of small-bank charters," says
financial analyst Ken E. Walsh of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Some managers deposed in the mergers, he
adds, are eager to start their own banks in their familiar,
local market.
   Nascent banks have some obvious advantages. They aren't
strapped by unwise loans made in real estate, Third World
debt or leveraged buy-outs, as many big banks are.
   Still, small banks face their own obstacles, ranging from
state lending ceilings to the inconvenience of single
locations. But Don J. Kauth, a bank analyst with First Albany
Corp. in Albany, N.Y., says the industry shakeout favors
community-oriented banks along with the efficient giants.
   Alan Armstrong, owner of Tiffany Dining Palace &amp; Gazebo in
Centre City, Pa., has discovered the pluses and minuses of
dealing with a smaller bank, Madison Bank of Blue Bell, which
has $28 million in assets.
   For Mr. Armstrong, Pennsylvania's lending limit of 15% of
a bank's capital for any one customer is a drawback in
dealing with a small bank. It means a second bank must
participate in larger loans, requiring twice the paper work
and personnel. "It's more complex, like having two bosses,"
he says.
   Yet, in a tight credit market, it helped that the local
banker knew his 20-year business history, he adds. "I could
get loans at Madison when I couldn't get loans at other
places," he says.
   Another entrepreneur, Pat T. Deon Sr., just moved some
company accounts to Madison Bank from First Pennsylvania
Bank, which had $5.2 billion in assets before being acquired
recently by CoreStates Bank NA.
   "Every time you do business with {Madison}, you don't have
to go through the torture test," says Mr. Deon, whose family
runs a commercial-development company in Fairless Hills, Pa.
He says he not only gets next-day notice on loan approvals,
but also runs ideas by Madison's president, Vito DeLisi, who
knows the local market and is easy to "get on the phone."
Such access is hard to come by in the big banks.
   Jim Hoffman, 61 years old, is a refugee from just such a
bank. When he left his post as senior vice president of
Meridian Bank, which has $10.1 billion in assets, Mr. Hoffman
was tired of the "bureaucracy of corporate giants." When
small-business owners in his community of Media, Pa.,
approached him about starting a local bank, Mr. Hoffman chose
to return to his "roots in country banking."
   With a group of seven co-founders, Mr. Hoffman raised $4
million in six months in 1988. Security First Bank, now two
years old, has assets of about $37.1 million and has been
profitable in the past four quarters. It offers loans as
small as $1,000, a sum that doesn't excite most big banks.
   At big banks, "the lines are longer and there is no
familiar face to take care of Henry or Sarah," Mr. Hoffman
says. "There are those who love the bank machines, and those
who prefer personal service."
   Anna and Carl Galantino are just the types Mr. Hoffman has
in mind. The Galantinos have run a building-supply company
for 50 years, doing business for most of that time with
Mellon Bank, which has $29.4 billion in assets. But they
recently moved their company's accounts to nearby Security
First. "We got fed up with Mellon," says Mrs. Galantino. "It
got too big to pay any attention to us. We decided to take
our business someplace else. And to this day, not a soul from
Mellon has asked why."
   A Mellon spokeswoman responds: "We're always unhappy to
lose a customer. It tells us we have to keep trying harder."
   Several of the new start-ups have targeted business people
and other borrowers in ethnic communities. In Philadelphia's
Chinatown, First Commercial Bank of Philadelphia recently
held its first anniversary gala. Teller windows became a
makeshift bar, and the cocktail chatter was mostly in
Cantonese, Mandarin or Vietnamese. First Commercial targets
Asian customers, as well as food purveyors at nearby street
kiosks and farmers' markets.
   "We have an advantage over competitors in that we speak
the language of our customers," says Chairwoman Julie Wong,
whose bilingual agents translate documents for clients.
   First Commercial's customized service approach also has
drawn interest outside the Asian-American community. Raymond
Wyszynski, president of Wyszynski Provision, meat packers,
appreciates the caliber of loan officers at First Commercial,
where he is negotiating a loan.
   His company has several accounts at CoreStates Financial
Corp., which has $23.3 billion in assets, but Mr. Wyszynski
says: "Our contact only has a limited amount of authority.
I've seen an influx of younger kids being groomed for higher
positions. I'm irritated by personal things -- a young loan
officer who probably can't manage his personal savings having
a say in my business."
   Spokesmen for Mellon and CoreStates say they welcome
competition, and argue they aren't losing many customers to
niche banks, especially when it comes to lending. Large
banks, they say, offer more services, locations and
technological support.
   Smaller banks do face obstacles. They tend to confine
lending to one geographic area and are vulnerable to swings
in the local economy. Community banks should be especially
careful to diversify by borrower, industry and type of loan,
says First Albany's Mr. Kauth.
   The personal touch can inspire faith even in investors,
which is especially important because of the unorthodox
methods some bank entrepreneurs use to get started. Effie
Holloman, a retiree who lives on $12,000 a year, recently
signed on as an investor in United Bank of Philadelphia with
a check for $1,000. She was just one investor tapped by
United Bank Chairwoman Emma Chappell at a gathering at the
Prayer Chapel God in Christ in northwest Philadelphia.
   If United Bank, which has acquired about $3.5 million in
capital, can raise $1.5 million more, it will get a full
charter from the state and become the first black-controlled
bank here since 1956, designed to "empower" minority
businesses as well as wean clients away from check-cashing
agencies, says Mrs. Chappell.
   Mrs. Holloman thinks that's a worthy cause. "I think we
need an Afro-American bank in this city, and I have
confidence in God that it will survive."
