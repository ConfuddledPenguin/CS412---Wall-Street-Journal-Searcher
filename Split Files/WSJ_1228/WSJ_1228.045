   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev spent
Thursday trying to hold his government together.
   Late in the day, Mr. Gorbachev's choice for vice president
was confirmed by the country's largest law-making body, but
only after he was defeated in a first round of voting and Mr.
Gorbachev pleaded for the congress to reconsider. Meanwhile,
the parliament of the Russian Federation voted to slash its
contribution to the national budget.

   Gennady Yanayev, the only candidate on the ballot for vice
president, is considered a longtime Communist bureaucrat. His
nomination was a surprise to those who expected a more
moderate choice who might smooth over at least some of the
nation's complex problems.
   The session of the Congress of People's Deputies,
adjourning after 10 days, left Mr. Gorbachev embarrassed and
embattled. It began last week with the unexpected resignation
of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who said he was
leaving the government because a "dictatorship was coming."
But it ended with the impression that while Mr. Gorbachev
might be tilting toward a more orthodox communist stance, he
faces resistance and may have to compromise to keep the union
together.
   Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev himself warned that if the Russian
Federation persists in withholding 119 billion rubles from
the central Soviet budget of about 250 billion rubles, "there
will be disintegration, not only of the economy, but of the
country as well."
   The Russian Federation, headed by Boris Yeltsin, is the
largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics and holds key
natural resources of oil, gas and gold. The federation
declared its sovereignty in May and has adopted its own
reforms leading toward a market economy. Its parliament voted
Wednesday to allocate only 23 billion rubles to the national
budget. It is possible that other restless republics and
regions, such as the Baltic states, might also try to
withhold funds.
   Mr. Gorbachev pleaded with the congress to pass a
temporary economic cooperation agreement, and the lawmakers
abided with a resolution that gave Mr. Gorbachev and the
republic leaders until Jan. 10 to complete a plan. It isn't
known how the Russian Federation will respond.
   The lawmakers also reconsidered their initial rejection of
Mr. Yanayev, who at first fell 31 votes short of the 1,120
votes needed for a simple majority of the 2,239 registered
deputies. On the second vote, he received 1,239 votes, with
563 deputies voting against him. Election Commission Chairman
Yuri Osipyan said the difference in the vote could be
attributed to 107 deputies who received ballots but hadn't
voted the first time, and 113 ballots that were found to be
invalid.
   The conservative Mr. Yanayev, 53 years old, is a lawyer
who most recently served as secretary of the policy-making
Communist Central Committee. He was elected to the party's
ruling Politburo in July after a party shake-up that
significantly reduced its authority, and is a leader of the
parliament's 730-member Communist bloc.
   Deputies said Mr. Yanayev's initial defeat was a protest
against his conservatism and relative obscurity. "The choice
is an insult to the people because he is such a minor figure
for this position," said Feodor Burlatsky, editor of the
liberal newsweekly, Literatyrnaya Gazyeta.
   Others said they had voted against Mr. Yanayev because he
is an ethnic Russian and they had wanted a representative
from one of the outlying republics. Mr. Gorbachev prevailed
upon the deputies to reconsider by telling them that he
needed "a man I have total confidence in to be by my side at
this difficult turning point in my life."
   Mr. Gorbachev hasn't yet specified what kind of role the
vice president will play. It is the first appointment in the
new government structure and system of executive power, which
the congress approved Wednesday morning. Other key posts,
including a successor for Mr. Shevardnadze as foreign
minister, have not yet been named.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov is recuperating from a
heart attack suffered earlier this week and isn't expected to
return to work soon, if at all.
