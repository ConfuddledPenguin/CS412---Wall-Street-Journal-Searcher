   Looking forward, Myles M. Kranzler, chairman and
president, said the company expects that "after a slow start,
1991 will be profitable but with revenue in the $30 million
to $35 million range."
   For 1992, Mr. Kranzler said the company sees sales of
"over $40 million with better than 80 cents a share net
income, and a continuation of growth in both sales and
profits in 1993."
