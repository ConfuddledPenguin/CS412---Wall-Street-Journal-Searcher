   TORONTO -- Shareholders of Hollinger Inc. voted to move
the company's registered head office to Vancouver, British
Columbia, from Toronto.
   Hollinger, a newspaper publishing concern, said its most
significant Canadian operations are in western Canada,
including the Sterling newspaper chain. The company's
president and chief operating officer, David Radler, lives in
Vancouver.

   Other major Hollinger executives will remain in Toronto,
and officials said the move isn't expected to affect the
company's operations.
