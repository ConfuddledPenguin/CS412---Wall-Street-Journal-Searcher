   PRAGUE -- The first round of auctions to privatize small
shops and state-owned businesses is scheduled to begin next
month, the state CTK news agency said.
   The privatization is part of the government's program of
economic reforms and is designed to turn over to private
hands some 130,000 small shops and enterprises as the
nation's centralized economy is transformed into a
Western-style economy.

   The first auctions are scheduled for the last weekend in
January in Prague.
   Thousands of vendors across the country staged symbolic
strikes in September demanding they be given first crack at
buying the shops and a chance to pay as much as half the
price in installments over a seven-year period.
   However, the law approved by parliament in October
excluded any provisions that would give preferential
treatment to any potential buyer.
   Auctions will be held in two rounds with the first one
only for Czechoslovak citizens and those who left the country
after 1948, when the Communists came to power.
   Shops and enterprises that aren't sold in the first round
will proceed to the second, in which some foreigners will
also be allowed to bid. CTK said it would take at least a
year to sell the shops and businesses.
   Privatization of large industrial plants and the
agricultural sector is expected to begin later in 1991.
