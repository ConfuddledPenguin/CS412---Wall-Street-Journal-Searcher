   Georgia-Pacific Corp. and International Paper Co. were
named defendants in a $2 billion lawsuit filed in Mississippi
that alleges the two paper companies dumped dioxin and other
pollutants into three state rivers.
   The suit, which includes more than 1,800 plaintiffs,
states that the companies knew that their plants were dumping
toxins into the waters -- but continued to do so, posing a
"health risk to human beings, wildlife, aquatic life and the
environment in general."

   The action comes on the heels of a setback for
Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta, in a similar suit. In late
October, a jury in Leakesville, Miss., awarded $1 million in
punitive damages to a man who lived along the Leaf River, one
of the three waterways in the current action, and who claimed
that Georgia-Pacific had contaminated the river with dioxin
and other chemicals.
   That decision, as well as the latest filing, are only the
tip of the litigation iceberg, insisted John Deakle, a
Hattiesburg, Miss., lawyer who represented the original
plaintiff in Leakesville. As many as 60 people a day are now
crowding his office, he said, seeking to file similar suits
against Georgia-Pacific and International Paper.
   "You ain't seen nothing yet," he said, estimating his firm
may eventually represent as many as 4,300 plaintiffs. "The
next wave will be massive."
   Georgia-Pacific, which already has said it will appeal the
Leakesville case, said it hadn't seen the current suit and
couldn't comment on the particular allegations. But a
spokeswoman said the company's Leaf River plant hasn't
"adversely impacted the environment of southern Mississippi."
She added that dioxin is present in the plant's effluent, but
said levels of the chemical have been "reduced by 98% in the
past two years." Moreover, she said, dioxin levels in the
river's fish "fall within guidelines set by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration."
   Officials at International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y.,
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Georgia-Pacific's Leaf River plant was originally owned by
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., which Georgia-Pacific acquired
in February. The six-year-old facility, situated in New
Augusta, Miss., produces bleach/kraft pulp, which is used to
make several paper products. The bleaching process, which
makes paper white, involves the use of chlorine gas that, in
turn, results in the production of dioxin.
   International Paper's plant, which sits on the Escatawpa
River in Moss Point, Miss., also manufactures bleached pulp
and paper products, according to the suit.
   The 1,800 plaintiffs, said Irwin W. Stolz, an Atlanta
attorney and one of five lawyers representing the group,
either live along the rivers or consume fish from the rivers
as a major part of their diet.
   Evidence of damage to the river and wildlife is "graphic,"
Mr. Stolz said. There are "fish with sores and bulges all
over them {as well as} beaches covered with dead mussels and
various colors of stain as broad as the colors of the
rainbow." Moreover, he said, "We don't have any indication
that {the pollution} has abated at all."
   The rivers, which flow through southeastern Mississippi to
the Gulf of Mexico, pass through some of the most
economically depressed areas in the country, said Mr. Deakle,
the Hattiesburg attorney. "It's the same old story," he said.
"You put the pollutants on the poor and the powerless."
   The latest suit was filed in Jackson County (Miss.)
chancery court. It seeks to enjoin the companies from
continuing the alleged practices, and asks for a judgment of
$150,000, plus $1 million in punitive damages, for each
plaintiff.
   Mississippi law forbids class-action suits. Thus, each
plaintiff's case might have to be tried separately. "This is
not something that's going to go away," Mr. Deakle said.
