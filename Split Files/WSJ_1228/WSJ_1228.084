   NEW YORK -- Stock prices eased in a slow trading session
shortened by a delayed opening.
   Trading didn't begin on the Big Board or other exchanges
until 11 a.m. EST because of an early morning explosion at a
transformer in Lower Manhattan.

   The explosion blew out windows at the building that houses
the computers and offices of Securities Industry Automation
Corp., which processes much of the trading activity on the
exchanges. The Environmental Protection Agency denied anyone
access to the building until it tested whether the blast had
contaminated the offices. No contamination was found.
   Trading then began on a weak note, and share prices
drifted lower late in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed with an 11.63-point loss at 2625.50, nearly
erasing Wednesday's 16-point gain.
   Trading yesterday "was just the reverse" of Wednesday,
says Dudley A. Eppel, manager of equity trading at Donaldson
Lufkin. Trude Latimer, market strategist at Jesup Josepthal,
says that while portfolio managers may have been adding to
their year-end positions Wednesday, yesterday they were
dumping stocks they didn't want on the books.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.'s 500-Stock Index lost 2.56 to
328.29, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 1.12
to 179.48, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 2.12
to 304.43.
   On the Big Board, advancers trailed decliners 598 to 892
with 514 unchanged. Volume grew to 102.9 million shares from
Wednesday's 78.7 million.
   American Stock Exchange volume grew to 9,350,000 shares
from 7,970,000 Wednesday, with 240 issues advancing, 330
declining, and 291 unchanged.
   Some market watchers are shedding their bearskins as they
look to 1991.
   For example, Elaine Garzarelli is telling clients that a
new bull market has begun. The Lehman Brothers executive vice
president and director of sector analysis, who was credited
with predicting the October 1987 stock market crash, says
investors who buy shares now can expect total returns from
stocks of as much as 25% over the next 12 to 13 months.
   "This is an opportunity that only comes around every 8 to
10 years," Ms. Garzarelli says.
   Lehman predicts the current recession will last until
summer 1991, with the economy recovering during the second
half. The stock market already is anticipating that recovery,
Ms. Garzarelli says.
   Based on current interest rates and her earnings estimates
for 1992, she says the Dow Jones industrials should reach
3185 around the end of next year.
   Ms. Garzarelli, who uses her own system of 13 indicators
to forecast the market, turned bullish in late September. She
now says the bear market bottomed on Oct. 11 when the DJIA
closed at 2365, shortly after her indicators gave their buy
signal.
   Any pullbacks from here should be limited to between 4%
and 7%, she adds.
   She advises that investors buy shares on any market
weakness, particularly if the market dips on concern about
corporate profits when 1990 fourth-quarter earnings are
reported in mid-January.
   "Any drop below 2500" on the Dow "should be considered an
excellent gift," she says.
   Ms. Garzarelli says the best investment opportunities lie
in those cyclical industries that typically recover first
following a recession. She recommends 14 industry groups that
have performed about twice as well as the broader market
following each of the past four recessions.
   They are airlines; broadcast media; leisure-time products;
homebuilders; truckers; semiconductors; retailers;
textile/apparel; building materials; pollution control;
electronics; publishing; newspapers; and containers and
paper.
   Casino operator Caesars World fell 1 to 15 5/8 as it
closed the acquisition of all publicly held shares of Caesars
New Jersey.
   Tiffany sank 2 1/4 to 35 after falling 4 3/8 Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs and Dean Witter cut earnings estimates for the
luxurygoods company after Chairman William R. Chaney said
disappointing year-end sales would justify lowering profit
expectations for the fourth quarter.
   Acuson dropped 1 5/8 to 27. An arbitrator ordered the
company to pay $6.3 million plus attorney fees and costs to a
unit of Westmark International Inc. in a dispute over
marketing activities.
   McDonald's added 1/8 to 28 1/2. The fast-food chain is
testing a version of a low-fat burger, the Lean Deluxe, with
promising results, USA Today reported.
   Georgia Gulf jumped 1 1/8 to 9 1/4 after First Boston
raised its investment rating on the stock and boosted its
earnings estimates for the company.
   Frank B. Hall added 3/8 to 3 7/8. The activity sparked
speculation that the insurance broker's majority owner,
Reliance Group Holdings, is increasing its holdings, as it
has said it would. Reliance Group officials were unavailable,
but in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last
month, the company said it planned to buy as many as two
million of Hall's common shares periodically in the open
market. Reliance eased 1/4 to 5.
   Service Merchandise added 3/4 to 5 5/8 in active trading.
Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer and Morgan Keegan both made
positive comments about the stock yesterday.
   The Amex's Market Value Index fell 1.32 to 303.67.
