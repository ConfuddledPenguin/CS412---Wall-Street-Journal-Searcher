   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., benefitting somewhat from
the sagging fortunes of retailing giants, said same-store
sales for December are running "in the low double digits"
higher than a year ago.
   Although that falls short of the 28% increase in
Merry-Go-Round's same-store sales last December from the
previous year, it compares favorably with results of many
other retailers, whose recent sales have been depressed by
flagging consumer confidence and uncertainty over the
economy. November same-store sales for big retailers were
essentially flat with adjusted year-ago figures, analysts
say.

   Although Merry-Go-Round's increases in comparable-store
sales figures have been declining in recent months, the
company is "showing strong performances and doing
considerably better than the retail industry as a whole,"
said Robert F. Buchanan, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
Inc., Baltimore. Mr. Buchanan added that Merry-Go-Round is
strong in such "hot brands" as Z. Cavaricci and Get Used, as
well as its private I.O.U. label.
   "Christmas is very good; we're very pleased," Michael D.
Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of the
specialty apparel retailer, said in an interview.
   Mr. Sullivan said that analysts' estimates are "right on
target" that Merry-Go-Round will earn about $36 million, or
$1.60 a share, on sales of $600 million to $620 million, for
the year ending Feb. 2. Mr. Sullivan also said he was
comfortable with analysts' projections the company will earn
$1.80 to $1.90 a share for the fiscal year that begins Feb.
3.
   In the year ended last Feb. 3, Merry-Go-Round earned $22.2
million, or $1.04 a share, on sales of $478.9 million.
Year-ago per-share numbers were restated to reflect several
stock splits. Merry-Go-Round, whose stock is traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, had been traded over-the-counter
before March 27, 1990.
   There was a 3-for-2 stock split in August 1989 and a
4-for-3 split earlier this year. Merry-Go-Round recently
announced a 3-for-2 split, payable Jan. 4 to stock of record
Dec. 21. The company paid its first cash dividend, 2.5 cents
a share, in June. After the next split, it will pay a
dividend of two cents a share, which represents a 20%
increase in its dividend rate.
   "Our stock always reacts well after a split," said Isaac
Kaufman, chief financial officer. Mr. Kaufman said
Merry-Go-Round periodically declares a split when the stock
reaches a certain level, because it gives the company "a lot
more liquidity." In the past month, the stock has been
trading in the low 20s, to as high as $24.50, up from the
mid-to-high teens it traded at in September.
   In the past few years, the Joppa, Md., company "grew a
little faster" than it had planned, Mr. Sullivan said. Since
1988, Merry-Go-Round has added nearly 250 stores, and
currently has 677 stores.
   Some of the success of the company, which sells moderately
priced apparel to 15-to-25-year olds, comes from
merchandising strategies, Mr. Sullivan said. "Some of it was
just business coming our way" from the bigger retailers, Mr.
Sullivan said. "We took a lot of market share from department
stores that were having credit problems," he said, adding
that those stores may have cut inventory in areas where
Merry-Go-Round is strongest.
   Business has been so good, in fact, that Merry-Go-Round
recently announced a $20 million capital expansion in which
it will add about 450,000 square feet to its relatively new
distribution center in Joppa, which is about 350,000 square
feet. All told, the retailer plans to spend $40 million to
$50 million on capital programs in the next fiscal year,
including spending on new stores and renovations, Mr.
Sullivan said. That compares with the about $40 million of
capital spending estimated for the current fiscal year. The
executive expects the expanded distribution center to be "on
stream" by spring 1992. In 1989, the company, whose stores
include Cignal, Merry-Go-Round and Dejaiz, acquired 124
Silverman's stores. That acquisition has been "very
successful," Mr. Sullivan said. Merry-Go-Round and Cignal are
unisex outlets, while Dejaiz, Attivo and Silverman's cater to
young men. Merry-Go-Round's specialty retail competitors
include Gap Inc. and Limited Inc.
   In addition, Merry-Go-Round is in the process of acquiring
as many as 55 women's apparel stores under the T. Edwards
name from Brooks Fashions Inc. of New York. Merry-Go-Round,
which is still getting approval from various landlords, has a
target of early February for the sale to close.
Merry-Go-Round will operate the T. Edwards stores under that
name, initially.
   Mr. Sullivan wouldn't disclose the purchase price. But he
said the company won't have to borrow to finance the
purchase. "We'll probably have in excess of $65 million to
$70 million in cash" at year end, he said.
