   PHILADELPHIA -- ExecuFirst Bancorp Inc. said it retained
Coopers &amp; Lybrand as independent accountants for the company
and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Executive Bank.
   ExecuFirst said it turned to Coopers &amp; Lybrand after
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, its original accountants, filed for
bankruptcy protection last month.
