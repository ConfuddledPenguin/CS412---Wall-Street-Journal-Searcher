   Vencor Inc. said it's negotiating to terminate its
contract to manage Vencor Hospital South Louisiana, a 49-bed
hospital in Gonzales, La. The hospital contributes less than
3% of the company's annual revenue.
   Vencor, which originally leased the hospital in 1988 and
entered into a contract to manage it in April 1990, said
termination is expected to occur within four months. The
Louisville, Ky., company is negotiating with hospital board
members.

   Vencor, which owns or leases 12 other hospitals, said the
Louisiana hospital didn't fit into the company's strategic
planning, and that Vencor is primarily interested in
operating hospitals in major metropolitan areas.
