   That Can Detect Heart-Attack Damage

   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new
imaging agent that can help doctors diagnose and treat the
damage caused by heart attacks without using invasive
procedures.
   The product, called Cardiolite, is an injectable chemical
tracing agent that can produce images of blood flow in the
heart when viewed under certain medical imaging cameras. It
was developed by Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del., and will be
sold by Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., a joint venture put
together earlier this year by Du Pont and Merck &amp; Co.

   Officials at Du Pont Merck said Cardiolite may be
especially useful in helping to diagnose the exact nature of
a heart attack within hours after it occurs. Unlike other
imaging products, Cardiolite can be injected during the
attack and the blood flow can be recorded immediately, giving
a doctor an instant picture of the attack. Other techniques
can't be used until a patient's condition has been
stabilized.
   "The availability of {Cardiolite} is an important step
forward in cardiac imaging and the treatment and prevention
of heart disease," said Daniel Berman, director of nuclear
cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles. "I'm
certain it will allow many medical centers to significantly
upgrade their ability to diagnose heart problems."
   Cardiolite is composed of a chemical called sestamibi that
migrates quickly to undamaged heart muscle cells after it's
injected into the bloodstream. The product also includes a
radioisotope called technetium 99 that allows an imaging
camera to pick up the sestamibi. Thus doctors can trace the
flow of blood as it moves through undamaged portions of the
heart. They also can use the product to illuminate the
heart's pumping action, blood flow through the heart's
arteries and areas in the heart where blood can't flow
because of damage from the attack.
   Currently, such images are most often produced by cardiac
catheterization, a technique in which a thin optical wire is
threaded into the groin or arm and snaked through blood
vessels to the heart. Some doctors believe that advances in
cardiac imaging eventually may reduce the need for some
invasive catheterizations.
   Doctors also can view such damage by injecting a chemical
called thallium and tracing it with medical cameras. But
thallium doesn't produce as strong a signal as technetium 99.
"Only a handful of very specialized medical centers can
produce truly useful pictures with thallium," Dr. Berman
said. "{Cardiolite} will be much easier for most hospitals to
use."
   Thallium is used most often in a stress test that's
designed to detect if arteries carrying blood to the heart
are blocked. Du Pont is one of several companies that makes
thallium for cardiac testing. Du Pont officials said
Cardiolite is an advance over its thallium products because
thallium's radioactivity is more difficult to handle. Also,
Cardiolite is longer acting than thallium and can produce
images for four hours after being injected, while thallium
images last only 15 minutes.
   Cardiolite is one of two new cardiac imaging products
developed in recent years by scientists. Last week, the FDA
also approved a product called Cardiotec that will be
marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Cardiotec also uses
technetium 99 to light up an image, but involves a different
agent, called teboroxime, for getting to the heart muscle
cells.
   Some doctors think Cardiolite may be the more widely used
of the two products, because it lasts longer in the body,
producing images for a longer period of study.
   Cardiolite is the first new product to be marketed by the
Du Pont Merck venture. The company will market other products
developed by Du Pont's drug and diagnostics research
programs.
