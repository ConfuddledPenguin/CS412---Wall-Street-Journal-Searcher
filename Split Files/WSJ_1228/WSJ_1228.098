   The state insurance department said the New York State
Court of Appeals upheld a fine against a subsidiary of
American International Group for overcharging taxicab owners
on liability coverage.
   As a result, the AIG unit, Insurance Co. of the State of
Pennsylvania, based in New York, must pay $425,000, the
insurance department said.

   In May 1988, the subsidiary was fined for overcharging
taxicab mini-fleet owners about $1.4 million over a
three-year period, starting in 1981. The state insurance
department fined the unit for improperly using a liability
conversion factor to increase premiums and increasing
premiums without state approval.
   AIG said the decision puts an end to the "old" case, but
questioned why the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
court, came to the decision without conducting a hearing.
"It's a shame," said Patrick Foley, AIG's general counsel.
"We feel the decision was wrong."
