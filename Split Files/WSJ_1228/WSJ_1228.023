   TOKYO -- Chemical Trust &amp; Banking Co. (Japan), a
subsidiary of New York-based Chemical Banking Corp., was
chosen over eight Japanese bidders to build and manage a
10-story building on a site here that is used as a postal
warehouse.
   The contract was granted by Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, in one of the first such projects
arranged by the Japanese government.

   Though the award involves less than 2,300 square feet of
land, the choice of a U.S.-owned company rather than Japanese
trust banks is likely to attract attention. U.S. officials
have been watching Japanese government procurement practices
in areas ranging from construction to computer systems. And
the financial services area is among the industries in which
the U.S. has been pushing hardest for fair access to the
Japanese market.
   The Japanese government in the mid-1980s proposed
developing public property through trust arrangements, but
only two such projects have been arranged so far, the
Ministry of Finance said.
   The Ministry of Posts said the winning bid was based on
projections for total dividends and estimated value of the
building when it is handed over to the government at the end
of the 20-year contract. Total projected dividends for the
ministry are 8.68 billion yen ($63.8 million) under
Chemical's plan, which calls for the first eight floors to be
rented as office space and the two top floors as residential
units. Estimated value of the building at the end of the
contract is 864.8 million yen ($6.4 milllion).
   A spokesman for Chemical in Tokyo declined to estimate the
value of the contract, saying details of the agreement are
expected to be negotiated by April 1. The 20-year life of the
project means there are many uncertainties in calculating its
profitability, he said.
   Under the arrangement, Chemical will borrow as much as two
billion yen to finance construction, and manage the building
for 18 years after its scheduled completion in 1993. Chemical
is to extract costs, interest and its own fees from tenants'
rents, and pay the remainder to the ministry as dividends.
