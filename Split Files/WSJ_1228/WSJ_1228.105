   HONOLULU -- No state is an economic island, but one clue
of how removed Hawaii may be from the mainland's doldrums can
be found in a nondescript hangar off the city's international
airport. Five shiny British Aerospace 94-passenger jets sit
in preparation for the planned April start-up of Discovery
Airways.
   If given a regulatory nod, Discovery is to serve
inter-island tourist routes already flown by two troubled
Hawaiian carriers. Its start-up actually is a rebirth -- it
was grounded last summer after 10 weeks when the initial
ownership ran afoul of federal prohibitions on foreign
control. Since then, the U.S. airline industry hasn't exactly
invited such a venture. But the strategy of the three
Americans who took over Discovery has a lot to do with why
the U.S. economic sun will set last in Hawaii. The key word
is Asia.

   Discovery's president, Clyde McAvoy, was a longtime
Continental Airlines executive in Tokyo (and sometime
contributor to these pages). He believes Hawaii's Asian
visitors, particularly, want more reliable and pleasant
service on connecting flights to the state's increasingly
popular "neighbor islands." These passengers generally must
hook up with one of the Hawaiian airlines because the big
carriers fly only to Oahu -- Honolulu -- and sometimes Maui.
Mr. McAvoy knows that tourism in the 50th U.S. state, indeed
much of its economy, is becoming a blend of East and West.
   That helps to explain why housing prices are highest in
the nation, why the state government is so flush it has been
cutting taxes and why analysts tend to believe the islands
can escape the crashing wave of bad news from the American
mainland -- as long as they don't get caught in a
recessionary riptide from Japan. At the same time, however,
Hawaii's upward spiral in the late '80s, with linkages to the
equity and property markets of Japan and a supervalued yen,
makes any prospect of a bilateral bust all the scarier.
   The Japanese presence has been notable here for decades,
but not until the 1980s did the rush come. Japan now accounts
for more than a fifth of the tourists, having nearly tripled
its annual count in seven years, and roughly half the money
spent by those who do visit. Travel in turn led to investment
in hotels, resort condominiums and lately the
commercial/office market.
   Those sound like losers in most parts of America. But
Hawaii has been different. Honolulu is distinct among U.S.
cities, for example, in its dearth of shopping malls and its
low downtown high-rise vacancy rate -- about 2%, though
expected to reach the mid-teens in a couple of years as a
slew of projects are finished.
   The extent of Japanese holdings, particularly in the
Waikiki hotel district, gives Hawaiians hope that business
and government leaders in Tokyo will shepherd this tourism
trail through any economic slump. Japan's employment levels
are expected to remain high, even if its asset markets
continue to decline. And that bodes well for travel, because
the middle-class, shut out of housing purchases and without
anywhere to park additional cars, has little else to spend
on.
   However, should the Gulf crisis or other drags on the
trade-dependent Japanese economy lead to a significant
devaluation of the yen, tourism abroad would be dearer.
Hawaiian real estate would suffer an even ruder jolt from a
lower yen. Nicholas Ordway of the University of Hawaii's Real
Estate Research and Education Center, reviewing the 10,000%
growth in the dollar volume of property transactions in the
state since 1965, finds a direct link between boom periods
and yen appreciation against the dollar. In upturns in the
Hawaii market, volume rises 3% for every 1% gain in the
yen/dollar ratio, he says.
   Mr. Ordway finds an uncomfortable parallel between the
Hawaii transaction volume and Chicago office real-estate
before the 1929 Crash. Japanese have been doing most of the
deals of more than $1 million, using home-country financing.
Even with a high yen, the top end of Hawaiian real estate
already has begun to sag, and Mr. Ordway sees trouble
deepening. How fast Japanese finance, geared to highly
leveraged assets, can or will contract is a question: Mr.
Ordway says, "We can expect intervention in the banking
system, but I keep returning back to what we saw in the early
'30s."
   David Ramsour, chief economist for Bank of Hawaii, is more
sanguine. "Historical patterns that Japanese banks have
followed with regard to maintenance of credit lines lead me
to think there will not be a contraction," he says. More
likely, he thinks, is a drying up of new credit. That will
stifle the luxury condominium market.
   Mr. Ramsour emphasizes, however, that Hawaii's financial
institutions aren't endangered: They weren't players in the
big deals, and even demanded 50% or more down from Americans
trading up into high-priced homes. (If anything, the
tightfistedness of the local banks was a complaint of
Hawaiian businesses long before recent cries of a national
"credit crunch.") Moreover, the islands' population has
maintained the best payback record of any state in the
nation.
   Mr. Ramsour argues that although unemployment may drift up
a bit from its remarkable 2.5%, the real oomph from an
estimated $11 billion in foreign -- mostly Japanese --
investment from 1985 to 1989 is yet to come. The transactions
merely shifted wealth between non-Hawaiian accounts. The
renovation or replacement of the properties lies just ahead
and will employ locals. About $3 billion will keep the 1.1
million-person economy humming, he says, maybe at 3% growth
in 1991.
   Residential real estate is widely thought to be stable,
although those amazing median prices of recent years
($375,000 in third-quarter 1989) may drop. The reason is a
changing mix of sales. Demand is off for the most expensive
homes, but is moving down the price ladder to the "entry"
condo market, at $200,000 or below. (About 40% of Hawaii's
dwelling units are condominiums.) Little construction of
"affordable" houses has been seen for 15 years in Hawaii
because of land-use constraints, and low-end shelter is due
to be bid up in step with earlier rises in classier homes. If
transactions thus are concentrated in cheaper units, the
average sales figure is going to come down.
   Housing at all market levels is a financial strain not
only because land is dear, but because construction, when it
can take place, is amazingly expensive. Mr. Ordway figures it
is 10 times or more the price per square foot on the
mainland, not only because building materials other than
cement have to be imported but because demand for workers has
zoomed and the arrival of new hands is checked by the high
cost of living.
   How does Hawaii maintain the balance between
tourist-service wages and high home prices? The secret, say
local analysts, is the locals' inclination to work multiple
jobs. And, particularly among those of Asian ancestry,
there's a willingness to crowd into one domicile.
   That doesn't appeal to many executives, so the housing
sticker shock is a major deterrent to drawing the kind of
managers or technical talent Hawaii could use to diversify
its economy. Aside from tourism and construction, only the
medical industry is a significant gainer; the state has a
mandatory health-insurance law. Production work is dwindling
with the gradual demise of sugar and pineapple plantations,
and though the state has a vibrant small-business culture,
neither high-technology nor any other significant sector has
emerged as a local wealth base. Alarm is expressed over the
numbers of college-trained young people leaving the state for
jobs that will afford them a better life style, but the large
U.S. military operations here yield some skilled personnel,
such as advanced mechanics.
   Hawaii long has suffered from high-tax paternalism, but
its economic ambitions have been bolstered by effective tax
cuts in the past two years. Income-tax brackets have been
compressed and the top marginal rate cut to 9 1/2% from 10%.
Credits have been expanded. According to mainland economists
Victor Canto and John Silvia, Hawaii's tax burden, which has
been fifth highest in the nation, is dropping far faster than
any other state's.
   Whether this represents anything more than a good-times
jubilee is another question mark over the Hawaiian horizon.
Government remains heavy and difficult for entrepreneurs to
deal with. But as long as the Asians come, even if only to
buy Louis Vuitton "souvenirs" instead of real estate, the
islands' economy should remain blessed. In November, that
visitor traffic was up 21% from that month a year earlier,
leading to an overall 3.9% jump in tourist numbers. No wonder
Clyde McAvoy wants to get Discovery Airways back off the
ground.
