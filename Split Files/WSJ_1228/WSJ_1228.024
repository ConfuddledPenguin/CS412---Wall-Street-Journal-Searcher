   NEW YORK -- David A. White, head of Unisys Corp.'s pension
fund known for aggressively using new investment techniques,
was named treasurer and chief investment officer of the
Rockefeller Foundation.
   Mr. White, 45 years old, will assume investment duties for
the $1.9 billion foundation on Jan. 14. He succeeds Jack R.
Meyer, who took over the top investment job for the $5
billion Harvard University endowment in June.

   "We think we are going into a very difficult, troubled
decade and we wanted someone who had sailed rough seas in the
past," said Peter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller
Foundation. He described Mr. White as a "tough, modern
portfolio manager primarily from the quantitative school."
   Mr. White has spent his entire career at Unisys, the
loss-plagued computer maker, and its predecessor, Burroughs
Corp., which he joined in 1971. As head of pension operations
since 1983, Mr. White became known for using a variety of
leading-edge investment strategies for the $2.9 billion fund,
including risk arbitrage, currency investing and stock short
sales as part of so-called market-neutral portfolios.
   "He wants to be at the cutting edge and was not at all shy
to try new things," said W. Michael Blumenthal, former
chairman of Unisys and once a Rockefeller Foundation board
member and now a limited partner with the investment banking
firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
   Other investment people agreed with that assessment. "He
has a reputation in this business that if you have a new
investment idea, you ought to take it to him," said George
Hambrecht, a money manager with Paradigm Partners Inc.
   Mr. White said that the Rockefeller Foundation's
willingness to use new investment approaches attracted him to
one of the investment community's most prestigious posts.
   "They certainly have been innovative in the past and I
hope they will continue to be so," he said.
   As for changes he plans at the foundation, "I see it as
evolutionary," Mr. White said. Still, he said, the
foundation's portfolio "could be more aggressive with their
indexing" of securities to track market barometers such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   Mr. White attended the University of Michigan, where he
received an undergraduate degree and a master's degree in
business administration. He was recruited to the Rockefeller
Foundation by Russell Reynolds Inc., which earlier had been
Harvard's recruiter in finding Mr. Meyer for its endowment
post.
