   Cash Didn't Bolster Stock Funds This Year

   NEW YORK -- Excuses, excuses.
   In what has become an unpleasant year-end ritual, most
stock mutual fund managers will once again have to explain
why they failed to beat the market. This year will be the
eighth in a row that the average diversified stock fund has
lagged behind the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.

   But while 1990 may seem like just another year of
market-lagging performance, this time around fund managers
won't be able to use one of their favorite excuses. In years
past, they have often argued that their need to hold cash to
meet shareholder redemptions held them back during the raging
bull market of 1982-89. But in this year's down market,
holding cash should have helped them beat the market.
Instead, they lagged behind by 3.5 percentage points.
   "There's no getting around the fact that it's been a
dismal year for equity portfolio managers," says Gerald
Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, a Chicago
newsletter.
   Fund managers tend to perform worse than the market for a
number of reasons. They, unlike the S&amp;P 500-stock index, are
handicapped by the annual expenses incurred by their funds.
Some managers also contend that, when it comes to rating
their performance, the S&amp;P 500 isn't the most appropriate
benchmark.
   Then there is the "cash burden." During the long climb in
stock prices from 1982 to 1989, holding any cash at all was a
drag on a fund's performance, because this prevented the fund
from being fully invested in the stock market.
   But this year, the cash-position excuse is looking flimsy.
With the stock market headed for its first down year since
1981, keeping part of a stock fund's assets in cash should
have bolstered the fund's performance this year.
   And recently, funds have held cash in record quantities.
This year, the average amount of cash held by stock funds was
never less than 10.7% of assets, according to the Investment
Company Institute, the trade group for the fund industry.
Cash holdings reached 12.9% of assets last October, the
highest level ever recorded since the institute started
gathering this data in 1961.
   Even with all that cash, the average stock fund --
excluding specialty and international funds -- still wasn't
able to beat the market. According to Lipper Analytical
Services, a Summit, N.J., fund research firm, the average
stock fund is down 6.8% so far this year, far worse than the
3.3% drop recorded by the S&amp;P 500-stock index. (These figures
are total returns, which include both share-price change and
dividends.)
   A look at fund industry history indicates that this
lackluster bear-market performance shouldn't be a great
surprise. If 1990 is included, the S&amp;P 500 has recorded a
calendar-year loss on eight occasions since 1960, which is
the first year for which Lipper Analytical has mutual fund
performance data. Of those eight years, funds beat the market
four times and trailed it in the other four.
   Why this poor performance? Holding cash is clearly a plus
when the stock market turns bearish. But it turns out that
another factor is even more important in determining whether
stock funds beat the market.
   Since 1960, the average stock fund has beaten the stock
market only 14 times in 31 years. The bulk of these
market-beating performances were clustered in two periods,
1965-68 and 1976-82. Both were stellar times for
small-company stocks.
   It seems stock funds are far more likely to beat the
market when small-company stocks are outpacing the big stocks
that make up the S&amp;P 500. "That may mean that fund managers
are risk takers, and tend to own the more aggressive stocks,"
says Mr. Perritt, the newsletter editor.
   Overall, small-company stocks have beaten the S&amp;P 500
stocks in 19 of the past 31 years, while the S&amp;P 500 stocks
have had the edge in just 12 years. (As a barometer of
small-company stocks, Ibbotson Associates' small-company
performance data were used.)
   Now take a look at when stock funds posted their 14
market-beating performances. Only one of the 14
market-beating years occurred during the 12 years when S&amp;P
500 stocks dominated -- and this happened in 1960, the first
year for which Lipper's fund data exist. By contrast, 13 of
the 14 market-beating years coincided with one of the 18
years when small-company stocks outstripped the S&amp;P 500.
   Why this pattern? Stock fund managers have a bias away
from bigger-company stocks, says A. Michael Lipper, president
of Lipper Analytical. He notes that the average fund owns
stocks with a market value of $8.7 billion, vs. a weighted
average market value of $16.3 billion for the S&amp;P 500.
   Simply looking at the average performance for all stock
funds may be misleading, says Joe Mansueto, publisher of
Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago newsletter.
   He points out that large mutual funds, because of their
size, tend to be heavily invested in larger-company stocks.
Yet when the performance of the average fund is calculated, a
$1 billion fund has as much influence on the average as a $1
million fund.
   "If you dollar-weighted the fund average, it would look a
lot more like the S&amp;P 500," Mr. Mansueto reckons.
   But he too suspects that fund managers may have
disproportionately large holdings of smaller-company stocks.
"Among professional money managers, I think they're swayed by
the studies that show that smaller companies tend to
outperform larger companies," Mr. Mansueto says.
   If this is the case, then stock funds may eventually start
beating the market once again. But for that to happen, the
much-heralded rebound in small-company stocks would also have
to occur.
