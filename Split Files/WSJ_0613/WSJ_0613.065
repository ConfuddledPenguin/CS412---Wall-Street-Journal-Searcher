   Denver -- Before considering women's gymnastics, as we
will in many of the paragraphs to follow, some definitions
are in order. A "senior woman" in the sport is a lass who
will turn 14 years old by Dec. 31, 1991, not the grueling 50
years required for senior status in men's golf. A women's gym
"veteran" is someone who was eligible for the last Olympics,
whenever that was. And any competitor who wouldn't have
passed casting muster as a munchkin for "The Wizard of Oz" is
thought to be quite large in size.
   By these standards, the senior women's all-around title at
the U.S. Gymnastics Championships in Denver Coliseum last
weekend was contested by quite different types. The defending
champ, fetching Floridian Brandy Johnson, was a craggy
Olympic vet of 17 who towered at an even five feet in height.
Her main rival was Kim Zmeskal, a Houstonian of 14 in her
first national senior meet, who, at 4-foot-5 and 72 pounds,
wouldn't have reached Judy Garland's sash.

   With two rotations to go in Saturday night's optional
exercises, Johnson held a .05-point lead over Zmeskal, but
fell off the balance beam and got a poor, 9.325 score.
Moments later, the pale-eyed Zmeskal flipped and twisted to a
near-perfect, 9.975 vault (two judges gave her "10s") to take
a lead she would not relinquish. Ah, the nervelessness of
youth.
   Before it was over, another kid -- skinny, just-15 Betty
Okino of Elmhurst, Ill. -- would turn in a smashing uneven
bars routine to pass Johnson for the silver medal, and Erica
Stokes, a not-quite-14-year-old with braces from Olathe,
Kan., would come up behind her for fourth.
   "I felt old tonight," said Johnson, whose 10th place in
the Olympic all-around at Seoul was the U.S.'s best, and who
won a silver medal in the vault at the 1989 World
Championships. "Now I know how some of the girls I used to
beat felt."
   Zmeskal, Okino and Stokes completed their weekend haul by
winning a total of six medals in Sunday's individual-event
finals, and their ascent marked nothing less than a
revolution at the top level of American women's gym. We have
this from no less an authority than Bela Karolyi, from whose
Houston gymnastics school the three come.
   Burly Bela, the mustached ex-Romanian, was, as usual,
among the best acts here, glowering at officials,
gesticulating at his charges and enveloping them in hugs when
they succeeded. His personal triumph was made complete by the
victory of pupil Hilary Grivich in the junior women's
division, and by the naming of still another of his products,
red-haired Amy Scherr, 15, to the five-member squad that will
represent the U.S. at next month's Goodwill Games in Seattle,
along with Zmeskal, Okino, Stokes and Sandy Woolsey, 17, of
Tempe, Ariz.
   Despite having coached many of the best U.S. women
gymnasts during his eight years in this land, Karolyi has
been denied national-team coaching assignments, but he
reasoned that the arithmetic of his having four of the five
contestants at Seattle should be clear even to the sport's
honchos, and secure him that post. He glowed over the group's
prospects there and beyond.
   "If even is coming the best Soviet and Romanian girls, our
kids will do well]" declared the circus sport's Papa Bear.
"They are powerful and hungry] They will fight for every 10th
of a point, every hundredth] The public will love them]" His
point about points was well taken in a sport that has taken
pseudo-accurate scoring to new heights.
   U.S. women finished a close fourth in the '88 Olympics, so
they won't have far to go to achieve international glory.
American men fell to 11th place there from first in '84, and,
thus, need a greater boost. And even though optimism is de
rigueur at affairs like these, no one on their side waxed as
bellicose as Bela.
   The men's all-around winner was John Roethlisberger, a U.
of Minnesota sophomore whose coach is his father, Fred, and
whose sister, Marie, was an alternate on the 1984 Olympic
team. He beat Chris Waller, of UCLA, by .4-point, and had
less than a .2-point edge over third- and fourth-placers
Lance Ringnald and Trent Dimas, both of Albuquerque, N.M.
   Roethlisberger's strength is consistency, not flash; 11 of
his 12 scores in the event were between 9.4 and 9.8.
Significantly, though, dad Fred later said John might skip
summer competitition to concentrate on body building and
adding the more-difficult routines international medals
require.
   Much of whatever hope the nationals engendered among the
men centered on the youth of the top finishers in a division
that emphasizes muscle more than elasticity: Roethlisberger,
Ringnald and Dimas all are 19, as is Bill Roth of Temple U.,
whose 10 on the horizontal bar was the first ever posted in a
U.S. national men's meet. That effort was highlighted by a
triple-somersault dismount.
   "We've got good prospects, but a long way to go," summed
up Art Shurlock, the longtime men's coach at UCLA. "A team
sixth at Barcelona {in 1992} would be terrific. Seventh or
eighth is more likely."
   The girls will be looking much higher thanks to a meet
that observers called the best since the one featuring Mary
Lou Retton et al. that preceeded the '84 Games. Zmeskal's
all-around gold was no surprise -- she's been the sport's
cover girl since winning the McDonald's American Cup in March
-- but Okino's second place was because she'd gathered no
such previous luster. Barring injury or untimely growth
spurts, the above-mentioned kids, plus other 13-year-olds
such as Grivich and really tiny (4-foot-4, 60-pound) Shannon
Miller of Edmond, Okla., the seventh-place finisher in the
all-around, will have it out for Olympic berths two years
hence.
   Chances are, they'll still have to contend with Johnson,
even though she'll be an ancient 19. She won individual golds
in vault and floor exercise on Sunday, and opined that her
personal hill had yet to crest. "Shoushounova {Elena, of the
U.S.S.R.} won the all-around at Seoul at 19," she noted.
"Julianne McNamara and Kelly Garrison made our teams when
they were over 20."
