   National Broadcasting Co., insisting that its audience
isn't shrinking as much as A.C. Nielsen figures suggest, said
it will slash the audience-size guarantees it makes
advertisers.
   The No. 1 network thus joins rival Capital Cities/ABC,
which did away with traditional audience-size guarantees
earlier this month, in a battle pitting the major networks
against advertisers. The networks all contend that Nielsen's
figures, which showed viewers deserting television in droves
during the first quarter, are inaccurate. Advertisers retort
that the Nielsen numbers, steep audience declines and all,
are perfectly correct.

   Millions of dollars are at stake: The networks have
traditionally guaranteed advertisers that their programs will
reach a certain number of viewers. This year, they had to
"make good" on those guarantees by coughing up some $150
million to $200 million of free additional commercial time to
advertisers when the ratings fell in the first quarter. The
networks are attempting to avoid a similar trouncing in the
future by curtailing audience-size guarantees. CBS is
expected to announce its own plan today.
   While advertisers object to any change in audience
guarantees, several said the NBC plan appears to be more
palatable than ABC's proposal. The NBC plan, using a complex
mathematical model, plots out audience levels over the last
eight years, and uses that trend line to predict levels in
the 1990-91 season. If reported audience levels drop below
its projections, NBC won't necessarily have to offer the free
"make-goods" to advertisers.
   Advertisers lauded NBC, a General Electric unit, for using
a trend line, which they said at least acknowledges that
audience levels have been steadily declining. ABC's plan, in
contrast, compares audience levels with an average of the
previous three years -- and the average figure masks the
steadily falling numbers.
   "At least NBC is more realistic than ABC; they are
publicly acknowledging that there is in fact a trend of lower
people-using-television," says Jon Mandel, senior vice
president and director of national broadcast for Grey
Advertising. Adds Lou Schultz, executive media director of ad
agency Lintas, "The NBC plan offers more upside than ABC."
   But Mr. Mandel, along with other ad-agency executives,
still opposes NBC's plan in principle. The NBC plan is "an
unabashed price increase dressed up in smoke and mirrors, and
hidden behind research issues which in fact aren't really
issues," he says. He objects to the fact that NBC is
basically establishing a floor level for the number of people
using television, and if levels fall below that, it likely
won't offer make-goods. "Saying that anything beyond the
trend is the responsibility of the advertiser, when it's the
network that is putting on the programming, is absurd," he
says.
   CBS is expected to follow with its own plan to limit
audience guarantees today. Television executives believe it
will likely follow one of its two competitors' plans,
probably the one it sees as most favorable to advertisers.
David Poltrack, senior vice president of planning and
research, said the network executives would meet this morning
to analyze the NBC plan and decide on what course to follow.
   He added, "Whatever we decide to do, there will now be
some negotiation. My feeling is there would be some
negotiation to try to come up with one approach."
   Ad-agency executives said that, based on their preliminary
calculations, the NBC system appears to be less costly than
ABC's plan. CBS's Mr. Poltrack said his network will be
working through that analysis. If both plans turn out to have
similar costs, he added, "We might say we'll use either one.
That's an option." ABC executives declined comment.
   Unless the networks do come up with a relatively uniform
plan, advertisers will face an unprecedentedly complicated
"upfront" buying spree, when advertisers buy network time for
the fall season. Upfront sales are expected to kick off soon,
but advertisers said they will probably be slowed by the
confusion over the new guarantee plans.
   Ad executives are accustomed to simple price comparisons
when they buy TV time; they know what it costs to reach a
thousand pairs of eyes through CBS, compared with NBC's
costs. But with the different guarantee systems as an added
factor, the cost-per-thousand measure isn't as meaningful:
"We're going to have to put conversions on every single thing
to make it apples-to-apples," says Grey's Mr. Mandel.
   NBC's Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of network
sales, says the network had no choice but to come up with a
plan limiting audience guarantees because of the sharp drop
in audience levels reported by Nielsen. In the first quarter,
following several years of a slow but steady decline in the
number of people using television, that figure suddenly fell
off by 6% to 7% from the year-earlier period.
   "That is a number we haven't seen in the history of
television. It was abnormal," he says. "We're protecting
ouselves against these abnormal changes. We can't get into a
situation where {Nielsen numbers} fluctuate beyond our
wildest dreams."

   C-M-E Wins Century 21
                                                                                                       

   Century 21 Real Estate Corp., a unit of Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., pulled its $30 million account from
McCann-Erickson's Los Angeles office and awarded it to
Campbell-Mithun-Esty.
   McCann participated in a review for the big account, but
Phillip Langford, Century 21's director of national
advertising, said yesterday that "we feel Campbell-Mithun has
a better grasp of where we need to be in the future."
   The other agencies in the review included Chiat/Day/Mojo,
BBDO, Young &amp; Rubicam, Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner, and D'Arcy
Masius Benton &amp; Bowles.
   Mr. Langford said C-M-E, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi agency, will
develop corporate image advertising that will spotlight the
service offered by its sales agents. Our advertising in the
past has "reflected only that we're big," he said. "I think
we need to emphasize the personal service that a customer
will get in a Century 21 office."
   He added the new campaign won't feature the "Put Your
Trust in No. 1" theme developed by McCann.
   Although the loss to McCann, an Interpublic Group unit,
will certainly be felt, its Los Angeles office has had a
healthy new-business year, having picked up the consolidated
Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star movie business and also a
chunk of ad business from Carnation.
   For Minneapolis-based C-M-E, the account is a major
victory. Century 21 now becomes one of the headquarters
office's largest clients, according to Howard Liszt,
president and chief operating officer. "The quality of
Century 21 and the quality of the {agency} competition makes
the victory a particularly sweet one," he said.
