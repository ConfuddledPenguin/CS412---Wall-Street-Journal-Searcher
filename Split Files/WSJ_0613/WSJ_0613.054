   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems said that Mentor
Graphics Inc. agreed to purchase $300 million of Sun
computers over the next three years, the first time Mentor
has broken its practice of buying only Hewlett-Packard Co.
machines.
   Mentor, a maker of software used in designing
semiconductors and other electronic parts, announced in
January that it would stop dealing exclusively with
Hewlett-Packard and begin making its software available to
Sun. Mentor buys computers, loads them with Mentor software,
and then resells them under the Mentor nameplate.

   The union between Sun and Mentor could prove a boon to
both. Mentor's software will now be available on products of
the two largest workstation makers. For Sun, a link with
Mentor's widely used software could spur acceptance of Sun's
so-called SPARC computer architecture, which is different
from Hewlett-Packard's workstation architecture. Sun and
Hewlett-Packard have been battling to establish their
respective architectures as the standard for the workstation
market.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun closed at $33,
up $1.375. Mentor closed at $24.25, down 25 cents.
