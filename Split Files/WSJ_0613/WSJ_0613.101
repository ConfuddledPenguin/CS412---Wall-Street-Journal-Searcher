   LONDON -- Stocks and sterling moved briskly higher on
renewed speculation of early entry of the British pound into
the European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism.
   But some market watchers asserted that the Thatcher
government is playing a risky game by deliberately fueling
the rumor mill about early ERM entry to keep the pound
strong.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
21.9 points to 2370.7, after rising as many as 30.4 points
soon after the opening.
   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks ended lower on moderately thin
volume, continuing in a drab mood after falling substantially
the past two trading days.
   The London stock rally was broad-based and included
recently depressed building-related and retail issues, which
would stand to gain if U.K. inflation, expected to reach an
annual rate of 10% by late summer, is cooled. Curbing
inflation is a prime economic and political goal that the
Thatcher government obviously believes can be achieved by
bringing the pound into the ERM.
   Analysts and money managers attributed the bullishness to
an unattributed article in the Financial Times that said the
government is preparing to bring the pound into the ERM as
early as September or October if sterling is strong enough in
the foreign-exchange markets. A spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher
said the article was "pure speculation."
   The market reaction was a smaller-scale replay of a
63.3-point jump in the FTSE 100 index May 17 when Chancellor
of the Exchequer John Major, in an interview with The Wall
Street Journal/Europe, dispelled market doubts that sterling
would join the ERM. Mr. Major didn't give any prospective
entry date.
   After months of rocky political and economic news in the
U.K., the recent positive pound-ERM speculation persuades
foreign and domestic investors "that U.K. assets aren't
necessarily depreciating ones," said Alastair Ross Goobey,
chief investment strategist at James Capel &amp; Co.
   But some are skeptical of the government's motives. "The
market is being drip-fed very, very speculative rumors on a
fairly frequent basis," said Joe Roseman, an economist at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew. "The government is getting a free lunch --
it's keeping the pound firm without having to raise interest
rates," he added. The base interest rate currently is 15%.
   "We need the domestic economy to get really hammered, or
we won't get inflation out of our system," Mr. Roseman said.
"The market is looking for a quick fix. It sees interest
rates tumbling down. They won't."
   And traders warned the government may be painting itself
into a corner if it can't make good on the speculation.
Sterling and equity prices could plummet if Britain fails to
join the ERM this year, traders said. "People are thinking
ERM entry has to happen this fall," said a London-based
currency trader. "If they don't join then, it's just going to
smash this market. The government has got themselves in too
far."
   Some traders believe that the government already is
preparing an escape hatch in case it decides against joining
the ERM. Mrs. Thatcher acknowledged yesterday that she
continues to seek the advice of Sir Alan Walters, an opponent
of British participation in the ERM, who resigned in October
as her chief economic aide. Questioned in Parliament by Labor
leader Neil Kinnock, Mrs. Thatcher said Sir Alan is "a family
friend" and that she "shall continue to see him as a friend
of the family."
   The government believes that ERM participation would
bolster the pound. Sterling would be tied to the strong
German and French currencies that, along with seven others in
the European Community, make up the system. In the system,
currencies can fluctuate within a 2.25% range, except for
Spain's, which can move 6%.
   Membership could be an important antiinflation tool for
Britain, because a strong pound would enable the government
to keep interest rates high. "The very process of strong
sterling is tightening in itself," said Capel's Mr. Ross
Goobey.
   Cutting rates with sterling outside the ERM could weaken
the pound and further stimulate inflation, which would force
the government to raise rates again. Such a raise would risk
political disaster for Mrs. Thatcher's Tories, who face a
general election no later than mid-1992.
   Meanwhile, Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 217.87
points to 32322.31. The index dropped 453.11 points Monday.
Traders noted that a weaker yen isn't helping buying
sentiment, while technical factors are adding to overall
bearishness.
   In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose
120.63 points to 32442.94.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 500
million shares, up from only 351 million shares Monday.
Decliners outnumbered winners 604 to 328, while 189 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 12.45 points, or 0.52%, to 2380.56.
   The second section index gained 7.85 points, or 0.19%, to
4064.80. Volume was estimated at 18 million shares, down
marginally from Monday.
   Nikkei futures had closed Monday at a discount to the cash
index, setting the framework for a wave of arbitrage and
other index-linked selling at yesterday's opening, traders
said. The key market barometer lost more than 200 points
within the first 15 minutes of trading.
   But bargain hunters cast aside the yen's softness
midmorning after prices of some electrical shares became
appealing and a small amount of arbitrage buying boosted
sentiment, observers said.
   At the same time, the dollar slipped slightly on technical
selling, brightening the stock market's mood, the analysts
noted.
   As a result, the Nikkei Index was up 2.07 points by the
end of the morning session. However, afternoon trading
mirrored early activity, as Topix futures were trading at a
discount.
   In yesterday's trading TEAC rose 70 yen to 2300 yen (45
cents to $14.87), TDK rose 40 yen to 6790 yen, and Sharp
gained 40 yen to 1820 yen. Nintendo added 700 yen to 23400
yen.
   Selling brought down Skylark, which plunged 150 yen to
2800 yen. In addition, Uni Charm fell 150 yen to 2160 yen and
Hattori Seiko fell 220 yen to 4980 yen.
   Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Hong Kong and Taipei,
lower in Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore and mixed in
Wellington. Manila was closed.
   And shares closed higher in Madrid, Milan, Amsterdam,
Paris, Zurich and Stockholm, lower in Frankfurt and mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed narrowly mixed.
