   NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said
that New York, New Jersey and New York City have obtained a
federal warrant to seize a British oil tanker that spilled
250,000 gallons of heavy oil into New York Harbor when it ran
aground last Thursday.
   He said the warrant gives New York and New Jersey
possession of the tanker, at least until a large bond to
cover cleanup costs is posted by the tanker's owner.

   The attorney general's office said the tanker, the BT
Nautilus, is owned by Nautilus Motor Tanker Co. of London,
and is operated by Bulk Tanker Management Ltd., also of
London. The warrant was obtained after the states and city
filed a lawsuit in federal court in Newark, N.J.
   In a statement, Mr. Abrams said that only by seizing the
BT Nautilus can the states ensure that the company will
provide the money needed to cover the full cost of the
cleanup and damages to the environment. His office was unable
to provide an estimate of the cleanup costs.
