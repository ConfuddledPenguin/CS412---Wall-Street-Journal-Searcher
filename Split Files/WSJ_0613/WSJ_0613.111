   MINNEAPOLIS --Michael Foods Inc. has removed John M.
Stafford as head of its egg division, which represents about
half the company's sales.
   A former chief executive officer of Pillsbury Co., Mr.
Stafford, 53 years old, had served in that position only a
few months. He remains executive vice president and a
director of the company.

   Mr. Stafford, who confirmed his removal from the post,
declined further comment beyond saying there were several
projects he may be assigned to. A Michael Foods spokesman
declined to discuss the unannounced change, saying the
company doesn't comment on personnel matters.
   Succeeding Mr. Stafford will be Daniel Gardner, 65,
chairman of Milton G. Waldbaum Co., a Wakefield, Neb., egg
producer, which Michael recently acquired.
   The management change came as a rival concern, Papetti
High-Grade Egg Products Co. of Elizabeth, N.J., confirmed it
is supplying a pasteurized egg product to Burger King Corp.,
the fast-food chain unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC. Burger
King is believed to be the largest customer for Michael's
Easy Eggs ultra-pasteurized product.
