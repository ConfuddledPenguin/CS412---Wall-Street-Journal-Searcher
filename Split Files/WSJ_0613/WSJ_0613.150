   NEW YORK -- Can entrepreneurs put a dent in the homeless
problem and still make a buck?
   Two black entrepreneurs here still think so -- but their
own experience suggests it isn't easy.

   Last summer, Bentley Whitfield and his partner, Cyril
Boynes Jr., took on as daunting a task as most small-business
owners might want to face: owning and running two rooming
houses catering to homeless single men. They bought their
buildings in July. And in August, Mr. Whitfield began
interviewing the destitute in homeless shelters, confident
that he could cull promising tenants. The partners aimed to
make a profit.
   But recently, the roof caved in on the entrepreneurs'
dream of bringing a private-sector solution to the public
problem of housing the poor. By May Mr. Whitfield's only
contribution to the homeless problem was occasional volunteer
duty as an overnight shelter attendant. The city runs the
buildings, which have large liens assessed against them for
penalties.
   One city agency is seeking to recover $20,000 in special
rent-incentive payments that Mr. Whitfield and Mr. Boynes say
they just don't have. The partners are still smarting from
vandals who, they say, flooded floors directly above some
newly renovated kitchens. They also haven't forgotten tenants
who destroyed stoves in order to qualify for city welfare
department restaurant allowances -- possibly to finance drug
habits, Mr. Whitfield says.
   The venture started with high hopes. Mr. Whitfield, a
former vice president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;
Smith, met Mr. Boynes, a restaurant manager and entertainment
promoter, at a rally for housing at a Harlem church last
April. The two formed a partnership, Connection Global
Properties, to acquire the two rundown, but habitable,
rooming houses for $200,000 -- practically all
seller-financed.
   The partners then agreed with the city's Emergency
Assistance Rehousing Program to take about 15 homeless men.
The program would pay the maximum public-assistance rent of
$215 a month for singles, well below the $300 to $400 a month
charged by similar buildings in New York. But what made the
entire deal viable, Mr. Whitfield figured, was the one-time
city incentive payment of $2,500 for each homeless tenant.
Together with the meager rent roll from the buildings'
existing tenants, Mr. Whitfield projected first-year gross
revenue of between $80,000 and $90,000.
   City officials were delighted because Mr. Whitfield held
out hope for the thorniest part of the homeless problem. "The
kind of thing he's talking about is simply very exciting,"
said Gail Gordon, who was executive deputy commissioner with
the main city welfare agency last fall.
   Increasingly, experts on homelessness are placing hopes on
a revival of "single room occupancy" housing, such as the
Harlem project. In such inexpensive housing, tenants occupy
single rooms, usually sharing baths and kitchens.
   The project also had special significance to Mr.
Whitfield. Four years ago, he pleaded guilty to a mail-fraud
charge involving misuse of Merrill Lynch funds. Sentenced to
three years' probation, he earned his living as an
independent financial consultant to small businesses.
   But he says he became driven to find a way to use his Wall
Street skills for social good. "I guess redemption is the
word I would use, especially in the eyes of my family and my
co-workers at Merrill Lynch," he says.
   The Emergency Assistance Rehousing Program, finding no
serious violations, told the partners they could start
housing tenants, Mr. Whitfield says. But on July 29, the city
agency that inspects housing found 70 violations, including
rodent infestation. The partners had to dip into a reserve of
about $6,000 to make some of the most serious repairs. In
September, the city told them that the most serious
violations had been cleared.
   The partners say they were told in September that the city
incentive money -- $37,500 -- would arrive by the end of
October. Less than half the money arrived -- at the end of
November, Mr. Whitfield says. At this time, he adds, the city
was also about $6,000 behind in the rental payments.
   Michael Handy, administrator of the city's Emergency
Assistance Relocation Program, concedes some payments were
late due to paperwork problems. Sometimes, he notes, tenants
delay the process by trying to get city rent checks mailed to
themselves instead of to landlords.
   But the partners proceeded anyway. With $1,500 in October,
they formed a small company of three tenants with
construction skills to work on the building. Much of the city
incentive money went to cover expenses in arrears.
   In December the oil-fired boiler in one of the buildings
began to break down repeatedly. After the third incident, the
partners found that the locks to the basement where the
furnace was located were broken and furnace parts had been
taken. The roof chimney had been bricked up, creating a
serious health hazard. Mr. Whitfield and Mr. Boynes say they
suspect a sabotage campaign by two tenants who were upset
because they weren't chosen to be part of the construction
company.
   Tenant organizer Terry Poe claims the partners were more
negligent than unlucky. "I went out and found the only source
of heat in the buildings was the gas jets on the common
stoves," Mr. Poe says. "The buildings were in deplorable
condition," he adds, with one basement filled with standing
water, unsanitary toilets and unusable sinks.
   Mr. Poe helped some disgruntled tenants press the city to
sue the partners in New York housing court last March,
charging violations of landlord-tenant law. Under pressure of
the suit, the partners then agreed to place the buildings
under city control.
   The partners deny wrongdoing. "I didn't break the locks
off the doors, I didn't break the boiler, I didn't break the
chimney. I didn't make any money off of this -- my kids went
without," Mr. Boynes says. "And I could have made those
buildings into condos]" he adds.
   Mr. Handy says, "Mr. Whitfield simply came to it with too
little, too late. I think it was a very good idea. But I
think he was unprepared for the task, imbued with a certain
social consciousness, and then reality seeped in."
   Mr. Whitfield, who is once again counting on consulting
work, says he still thinks private SRO housing can pay. The
trick, he says, is to triple the cash reserve you think
you'll need to offset problems getting payments from a third
party, such as a city agency.
