   ZAANDAM, The Netherlands -- In a case that was viewed as a
challenge to the defensive tactics of Dutch companies, the
District Court in Haarlem has upheld Dutch food retailer
Koninklijke Ahold N.V. in its battle against being taken over
by West German retailer Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG.
   At issue was whether Ahold had the right to issue
preferred shares to a friendly foundation with voting rights
equal to those carried by Ahold's common shares. Ahold issued
the preferred shares in August 1989, after it learned that
Asko had surreptitiously accumulated a 13.5% stake in Ahold
without informing the Dutch company.

   Under Dutch law, such an issue of preferred shares is
allowed and is routinely implemented as an anti-takeover
defense. In Ahold's situation, the foundation, Stichting
Ahold Continuiteit, was set up in 1973 as a contingency in
case the company was threatened.
   In a broader perspective, however, the case was viewed as
a challenge to the formidable Dutch takeover defenses that
corporations routinely implement.
   An Ahold spokesman said Asko could appeal the decision to
the Court of Appeals in Amsterdam but added that Ahold had no
idea whether they would or not.
   Officials at Asko were unavailable for comment.
