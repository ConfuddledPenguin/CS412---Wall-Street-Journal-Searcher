   GF Corp., Youngstown, Ohio, said it sold most of the
assets of its GF Furniture Systems Inc. unit to C.T. Ten, an
affiliate of Tang Industries Inc., a Chicago-based steel
concern. The price wasn't disclosed.
   GF Corp. and GF Furniture filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankrutcy Code last
April, after failing in earlier efforts to sell the furniture
business. At the time of the filing, GF said it had agreed in
principle to sell most of its assets to a Tang affiliate.

original manufacturing plant.
