   A sizzling rally in U.S. gasoline futures pushed world oil
prices sharply higher.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for
July delivery surged 2.62 cents a gallon to settle at 58.5
cents.

   The strong U.S. gasoline market contributed to a recovery
by crude oil futures of much of their recent losses and also
had an impact on European petroleum markets.
   A rally in the last two hours of trading on London's
International Petroleum Exchange sent the futures price of
the July contract for Brent blend crude 42 cents a barrel
higher to $15.97. In U.S. futures trading, the July crude
contract rose 69 cents a barrel to settle at $17.51.
   The crude gains, analysts said, were due in part to
expectations that a rally was overdue after the declines of
recent days. Analysts also cited some other factors,
including reports that Saudi Arabia is preparing to hold
output to its quota until the July 25 meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries even if others
in OPEC continue to exceed allotments.
   A report that Saudi Arabia had asked its biggest U.S.
customers to reduce their planned oil purchases for July hit
the New York Mercantile Exchange shortly before trading
closed. It kept the rally going, traders said.
   Earlier an announcement by Royal Dutch/Shell Group that it
will reduce use of its own vessels in shipping oil to the
U.S., for liability reasons, and news that Norwegian oil
workers are planning a July 1 strike contributed to the
firming of European oil markets. That set the stage for the
later strong openings in U.S. markets.
   But more important for the tone of U.S. futures trading
yesterday, according to several oil analysts, was a growing
belief that supplies of gasoline are tightening. Andrew
Lebow, trader and energy analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man, noted that
cash prices for gasoline have remained firm in areas such as
the U.S. Gulf Coast and the New York harbor even as futures
prices fell in recent days.
   That, he said, suggested some tightness could be
developing. Also, he said, there was a general anticipation
that the American Petroleum Institute's latest report would
show declines of 1.5 million barrels each for inventories of
crude and gasoline.
   The American Petroleum Institute's statistics, released as
usual after futures trading had closed, showed, however, that
inventories were up again. Crude oil inventories rose nearly
1.3 million barrels last week while those for gasoline
increased 511,000 barrels.
   "They were slightly on the negative side," said Nauman
Barakat, first vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton, who
described the report as mildly bearish.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose on an unexpected decrease in
London Metal Exchange copper inventories. The July contract
ended with a gain of 0.95 cent a pound at $1.1060. The London
exchange said its copper warehouse stocks dropped 4,475 tons
to 68,575 tons. Traders and analysts had expected an increase
of 3,000 to 5,000 tons. It was the second consecutive drop in
the exchange's copper inventories. Last Friday, inventories
were down 4,225 tons, for a total drop of 8,700 tons in three
business days. One analyst observed that the withdrawal of
copper stocks are coming at a time when demand is perceived
to be slowing as the industry moves toward its summer season
when consumption eases. On Monday, the July contract ended at
$1.0965, falling below the chief support level of $1.10, the
analyst said, which brought in bargain-hunters. The rebound
touched off short-covering, or buying back of contracts by
traders who previously sold short in anticipation that prices
would go lower, he said. The rebound helped the
soon-to-expire June contract even more than the July
contract, as June ended with a gain of 1.50 cents a pound at
$1.1250, further widening the premium of the June over the
July contract.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell in response to a report that
Poland was seeking to sell sugar. The October contract fell
0.52 cent a pound to 12.77 cents. Analysts said that two news
services reported that Poland was offering refined beet sugar
on the world market. One service said the quantity amounted
to 200,000 tons and the other simply said it was a surplus.
Judith Ganes, analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York, noted that
the report caught traders by surprise because Poland this
year had been expected to be a net importer of sugar. Also,
she said, recent statistics indicated that Poland didn't have
a surplus. The plunge in prices was accelerated when the
October contract fell below 12.85 cents, triggering further
selling, she said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed. August
delivery gold was off 60 cents an ounce to $359.10. July
silver edged higher by 0.50 cent an ounce to $5.04. July
platinum advanced $3.20 an ounce to $489.40. Gold eased
because of a strengthening in the dollar, said James
Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial Management of
Cambridge, Mass. However, the selling in gold may be showing
signs of exhaustion, he said, and gold prices may be
establishing a base from which to rebound. Mr. Kneafsey noted
platinum's gain and said it may be a positive indicator for
gold. "Platinum tends to be the market leader. It hit its low
of $465 for the recent move on April 25 and since then has
been rising. It could be that gold may be preparing to make
its upward move as well," he said.
