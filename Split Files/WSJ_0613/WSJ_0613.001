   Labor unions used to be big news in the U.S. Every other
week or so, it seemed, some major union was threatening to
disrupt a large segment of the economy by pulling its workers
out on strike. Labor leaders showed up on "Meet the Press,"
"Good Morning America" and other programs to tell the public
just what was in store for them.
   Unions haven't disappeared. Every now and then they even
get into the newspapers when they strike some company such as
Eastern Airlines or the Greyhound bus line. But the planes
keep flying and the buses keep running and no one pays a lot
of attention. Unions do break into the local news
occasionally, arguing with school boards about wages.

   The crux of the matter is that union members are simply a
smaller share of the work force. Between 1970 and 1987, the
percentage of U.S. nonagricultural workers who were members
of unions fell from 31% to 17%, a sharp drop by any
reckoning. Only Japan had a decline that was even remotely
comparable: Its union membership in the same period fell from
35% to 28%. In other major industrial countries membership at
the worst declined only slightly; in most nations it rose.
   David Blanchflower of Dartmouth and Richard Freeman of
Harvard ponder this disparity in a new National Bureau of
Economic Research working paper. Their key finding is that
U.S. unions have a much greater effect on wages than do
unions in other industrial countries. This difference, they
argue, gives U.S. employers a greater incentive to oppose
unions.
   Union membership has little effect on wages in Japan --
except for women, who seem to fare better if they belong to
unions. Japanese unions participate in a "spring wage
offensive" that more or less sets wage patterns for all
workers, unionized or not.
   In "Trading Places," a best-selling book about America's
competitive problems with Japan, Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.
suggests that the industry-wide structure of many U.S. unions
gave them a power that Japanese unions, organized on a
company or enterprise basis, did not possess. U.S. unions, in
his view, had a natural adversarial relationship with
management, while Japanese unions had a greater incentive to
work with management.
   American unions built up their strength in the first two
decades after World War II. The U.S. had a highly productive
industrial establishment, undamaged by war, and it could sell
anything it could make at almost whatever price it wanted to
charge. High demand made industrial peace a priority, and
industry was willing to pay for it with large wage increases.
   During the same period, many other industrial countries
were slowly rebuilding factories, trying to become
competitive in international markets. There was little
incentive for union truculence, and certainly no incentive
for companies to hand unions huge wage increases.
Management-union cooperation may not have begun during this
period, but in many countries it surely was encouraged.
   In the 1970s, however, the situation changed for
everybody. Two large oil-price shocks imposed major cost
increases on industry. All of a sudden the atmosphere for
unions changed. Management everywhere had an increased
incentive to resist large union wage demands, but nowhere was
that incentive as great as in the U.S.
   As Profs. Blanchflower and Freeman remark, there has been
a tendency to blame the decline of the unions on specific
events, such as President Reagan's breaking the air-traffic
controllers union, or on the stodginess, incompetence or, in
a few cases, outright criminality of labor leaders. But the
authors are convinced that the chief factor is what unions
have done on the wage front. The big wage demands may have
been justified in the 1950s and 1960s, but not in the 1970s
and 1980s. In recent years they have become a major obstacle
to the development of unionism in the U.S.
   If you can earn more money by joining a union, why not do
it? Well, workers are smarter than they sometimes are
believed to be. Companies in increasing numbers were moving
from union to nonunion areas, and what good is a high union
wage if you don't have a job?
   Employers, moreover, began to use the rights they had
under labor law but had seldom utilized. Eastern planes are
still flying and Greyhound buses are running because
management chose to hire replacements for strikers. As union
density has decreased, public attitudes have changed, making
it easier for management to stand up to unions. For most of
the public, "scab" no longer is a dirty word.
   If unions continue merely to do their thing, demanding big
wage increases and battling management, their future is
likely to be all downhill. Pockets of unionism will exist in
a few older industries and the public sector, but few other
places.
   The authors suggest that unions might try some new ideas.
In many European countries, workers often are union members
even in plants where their unions do not have bargaining
rights. To keep such members, unions must provide services,
such as low-interest credit cards, job training and
counseling and access to low-cost legal help. A second
possibility the authors mention is that white-collar and
serviceworker-oriented unions in the public sector might make
a major organizing effort in the private sector. Such an
effort would be based on such issues as working conditions,
job flexibility and fairness in promotion, not primarily on
big pay boosts.
   To make this work at all, it would have to be a two-way
street. A willingness of unions to work for peaceful growth
would have to be met by managements that would listen. In a
number of recent cases, company efforts to boost quality and
productivity have indeed been joint projects by managements
and unions. Properly used, unions can still be an important
communications link in American business.
   That isn't the kind of unionism we've had in recent
decades, but it may not be too late to give it a try.
