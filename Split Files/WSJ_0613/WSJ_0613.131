   CAMARILLO, Calif. -- Troubled Alpharel Inc. said it's
dismissing its secretary and chief financial officer, William
H. Lane, because it simply can't afford to keep him anymore.
   "It wasn't a good-guy or bad-guy thing," Robert T. Bruce,
chairman of the maker of computerized document management
systems, said in an interview. "We just have to cut back on
the number of non-revenue generating people" at the company.
Mr. Lane, according to proxy material, earned $91,246 last
year.

   Mr. Lane, a former Honeywell Inc. executive and private
business consultant who came to Alpharel a little more than a
year ago, will be succeeded this week by John W. Low, who has
been corporate controller of the company since August 1987.
   In January, Alpharel said it would trim costs by reducing
its work force to 19 from 40. In the first quarter, the
company had a net loss of $313,000, or three cents a share,
on revenue of $1.1 million.
   Prior to Alpharel, Mr. Low was with Price Waterhouse for
seven years, most recently as manager in their
Entrepreneurial Services Group.
   Mr. Lane couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
   Separately, Alpharel said Roger H. Erickson has been
appointed vice president, engineering. The five-year company
veteran, who has served as, among other things, director of
technical projects, succeeds Don T. Miller. Mr. Miller will
leave Alpharel in August, the company said.
