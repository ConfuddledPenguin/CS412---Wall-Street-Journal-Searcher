   NEW YORK -- The stock market meandered lazily through much
of yesterday's session, then sprang to life with a
full-fledged rally in the last hour and 20 minutes of
trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 40.85 to 2933.42,
less than two points shy of the record set June 4. Trading
was moderately active. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices
finished modestly lower -- down less than an eighth of a
point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount -- in sluggish
trading. The dollar gained against the West German mark but
fell against the Japanese yen.

   The stock market's late move parted company with bonds,
which barely budged from Monday's levels. Bond investors are
standing pat until the release later this week of economic
data that, they hope, will indicate whether inflation is
under control. The same wait-and-see attitude prevailed in
dollar trading. However, the dollar fell sharply against the
British pound amid speculation that the U.K. currency would
come under the control of the European Monetary System by the
end of this year.
   Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers, said the thin, narrow-range trading that
characterized the stock market until midafternoon was an
indication that institutional buyers were selectively buying
strong performers. This activity added to the anxiety of
bearish investors who sold borrowed stock after last week's
string of losses in a bet that further declines were in
prospect; they were hoping to replace the borrowed shares
later at cheaper prices.
   But with Monday's 30-point rise in the industrial average
and no evidence early yesterday of a significant, continued
decline, these bearish investors started buying. At the same
time, a form of program trading known as stock-index
arbitrage -- selling futures and buying stock to lock in
profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the two --
added thrust to the market's lift-off.
   Some analysts thought the program trading was the main
factor in the rally. "When you look at the generally light
volume and see bonds doing nothing," said Leo Grohowski,
director of equity portfolio management at Marinvest, "you
first have to think of programs as the reason for the market
bouncing the way it did in a relatively short period."
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 157.1 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 1003 to 545.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.45%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6965 marks and 154.55 yen, compared
with 1.6930 marks and 154.77 yen Monday. The dollar fell
against the pound to $1.7035 from $1.6860.
