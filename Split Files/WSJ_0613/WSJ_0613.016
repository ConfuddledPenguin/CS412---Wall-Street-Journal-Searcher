   WASHINGTON -- A special counsel to the Senate ethics
committee recommended that Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.)
be denounced by the Senate for "knowingly engaging in
unethical conduct which has brought dishonor and disrepute to
this institution."
   The recommendation, which came in the opening day of
trial-like ethics committee proceedings, means that Mr.
Durenberger, 55 years old, almost certainly has escaped the
stiffest sanction the panel could recommend -- expulsion from
the Senate. Denunciation is the equivalent of a censure, the
next most serious punishment senators can level on a
colleague.

   "It's a major rebuke and carries the same weight as a
censure," explained Donald Ritchie, the Senate's associate
historian. "In a collegial body, it's a severe blow."
   In a news release, Mr. Durenberger said, "I feel the
sanction of denouncement, as special counsel recommends, is
harsher than warranted." He added that while he has admitted
some mistakes, "all of my actions were taken in good faith in
an attempt to comply with all laws and rules." Mr.
Durenberger also expressed disappointment that there wasn't
time for him to give his opening statement on the first day
of his Senate hearing.
   After hearing all the evidence in the case, the
bipartisan, six-member ethics committee must decide whether
to approve the recommendation of the special counsel, Robert
Bennett. It then would take a majority of the Senate to
approve a formal denunciation of Mr. Durenberger. The ethics
committee also can recommend to the GOP Senate conference
that Mr. Durenberger be stripped of his seniority and
committee assignments.
   In 1979, Sen. Herman Talmadge (D., Ga.) was denounced by
the Senate for submitting false expense vouchers and failing
to report campaign contributions. Mr. Talmadge lost his
re-election bid in 1980. Mr. Durenberger, who has served in
the Senate for 12 years, doesn't face re-election until 1994.
   At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Bennett gave a scalding
summary of the evidence against Mr. Durenberger. The central
charges involve a book promotion deal for which Sen.
Durenberger received $100,000 in an alleged scheme to
circumvent Senate limits on honoraria, and a condominium
partnership through which Mr. Durenberger may have improperly
received Senate reimbursement for lodging expenses. In both
matters, Mr. Bennett said the senator engaged in a "pattern
of unethical conduct."
