   SINGAPORE -- South Korea's petroleum demand is expected to
rise 17% to 920,000 barrels a day this year from 788,000
barrels last year, the country's petroleum association
president, Hongsun Chang, said at an oil conference here.
   Mr. Chang, who also is the head of Kukdong Oil Co., said
demand from the country's industrial, transportation,
residential and commercial sectors will gain this year. He
said industrial demand for petroleum product naphtha, which
is a feedstock for petrochemical plants, is expected to grow
18% to 345,000 barrels a day, owing to the increase in South
Korea's ethylene production capacity.

   Gasoline demand from the country's transportation sector,
meanwhile, is expected to grow 25% to 60,000 barrels a day.
Mr. Chang said the country's residential and commercial
sectors also are likely to see an increase of about 15%,
because of the switch from coal to kerosene and diesel oil.
   Mr. Chang predicted South Korea's petroleum demand will
reach 1.35 million barrels a day by 1994, making the country
the sixth-largest importer of oil in the world.
