   NEW YORK -- In a surprise move, Bank of New York Co. named
Alan R. Griffith president and chief operating officer of its
flagship bank, ending months of speculation about management
succession at the nation's 13th largest bank.
   Mr. Griffith, who had been senior executive vice president
in charge of special industries lending, was the dark horse
in the race to succeed Peter Herrick, who will be 65 years
old next year. Mr. Herrick was named vice chairman of the
bank and remains president of the holding company until his
retirement.

   The promotion places Mr. Griffith in line to succeed J.
Carter Bacot, 57, as chairman and chief executive officer of
the holding company. However, Mr. Bacot said in an interview
that it is "premature" to call Mr. Griffith his heir
apparent.
   Mr. Griffith, 48, is a low-key individual who is noted
within the bank for his long hours on the job, his messy
office and the scribbled notes that he sends his bankers for
jobs well-done. "I'm a great believer in positive
reinforcement," he said in an interview.
   As president of Bank of New York, Mr. Griffith will offer
a sharp counterpoint to Mr. Bacot, who is known for his gruff
style.
   The favorite to succeed Mr. Herrick had been Richard D.
Field, whose consumer banking operation contributes more than
30% of the bank's earnings and is expected to grow with
future acquisitions. Other contenders included Newton P.S.
Merrill, head of U.S. commercial banking; Thomas A. Renyi,
who oversaw the 1989 merger of Irving Bank Corp. into Bank of
New York; and Samuel F. Chevalier, who was in line to take
the helm of Irving before the merger.
   Breaking with past tradition of the bank's president
coming from the trust department, Mr. Bacot said that Mr.
Griffith was chosen for "his breadth of experience."
   Under Mr. Griffith's role in special industries lending,
Bank of New York has become a big lender to the media and
entertainment industry. Its $3 billion portfolio of loans in
that industry is one reason that Bank of New York ranks high
on the list of lenders to highly leveraged transactions, such
as leveraged buy-outs or recapitalizations. Investor worries
about those portfolios have been a factor in pushing down
banks' stock prices over the past year.
   "One-third of our highly leveraged loans are to media
companies," Mr. Griffith said. "We underwrite these on a
classic cash flow basis. We don't look to the value of the
assets."
   Though mega-mergers have tailed off since last year, Mr.
Griffith said that there continue to be a surprising number
of smaller restructurings and acquisitions getting financed.
"It continues to be a good business," he said.
   In 1985, Mr. Griffith was put in charge of the special
industries lending sector. During the integration of Irving,
Mr. Griffith acted as credit policy officer, and at various
points in his career he has run one of the bank's leading
midtown retail branches as well as its international banking
business. He worked at Empire Trust Co. when it was bought by
Bank of New York in 1966.
   In the future, Mr. Griffith said he hopes to increase Bank
of New York's share of lending to small and medium-sized
businesses in the New York area. "We're not getting the
market share that we should," he said.
   In addition, the bank holding company named three
executive vice presidents: Gerald L. Hassell, communications,
entertainment and publishing division; Richard Pace, chief
technologist; and Vernon L. Van Hise, deputy head of U.S.
commercial banking. The company also named three senior vice
presidents: Francis Goodell, securities processing systems
division; Frederic A. Helfst, credit division; and Vincent
O'Leary, Southeast commercial banking.
