   Hoechst AG said it may record a 10% decline in profit for
1990, compared with last year's moderate profit growth.
   Hoechst Chairman Wolfgang Hilger said at the annual
meeting that the strength of the mark against key foreign
currencies as well as downward pressure on product prices
make it unlikely the company will be able to recover from its
8.5% drop in pretax profit in the first quarter.

   In the first quarter, the West German chemical group's
pretax profit fell to 920 million marks ($543.5 million) from
1.01 billion marks a year ago. Sales were unchanged at 11
billion marks.
   Despite the expectations of softer earnings, Mr. Hilger
said that Hoechst believes "a satisfactory dividend proposal
{for 1990} is possible." He didn't elaborate. The company
earlier this year boosted its annual cash dividend for 1989
to 13 marks a share from 12 marks.
   For the first five months of 1990, Hoechst reported
world-wide group sales of 18.5 billion marks, down 2%.
   For 1989, Hoechst posted pretax profit of 4.15 billion
marks, on sales of 45.9 billion marks.
