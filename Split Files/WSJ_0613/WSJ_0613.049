   LONDON -- Fisons PLC said it had obtained a positive
recommendation for approval of its new respiratory drug,
Tilade, from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel at a June 11 review meeting.
   "We are extremely pleased with this news, which could
result in a full approval in the U.S. in the near future,"
the company said.

   The FDA's panel sought evidence of the drug's efficiency
and safety, which were "adequately demonstrated," according
to Fisons.
   Tilade already has a product licence in the U.K. and other
European countries, including West Germany, France and Italy.
   However, Fisons share price closed at 356 pence ($6), down
11 pence, on the London Stock Exchange.
   Some analysts said recommendation for approval was widely
anticipated and players took profits on the outcome.
   However some analysts noted, more importantly, that the
panel wasn't convinced that Tilade differed substantially
from Fisons's other existing asthma drug, Intal, and
recommended its approval for only three conditions. Fisons
will have to submit more data to obtain marketing approval
for Tilade for more widespread use.
