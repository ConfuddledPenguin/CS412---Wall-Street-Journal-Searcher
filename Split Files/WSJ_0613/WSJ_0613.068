   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. hopes to raise $825
million through a public offering of 27 million new shares,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   As part of the offering, Tokyo-based Nippon Life Insurance
Co., as expected, will acquire about a $300 million stake in
the financial, information and travel services concern,
buying approximately 10 million shares at $30.96 a share or
the public offering price, whichever is lower.

   American Express said in March it planned a public
offering to help fund its pending acquisition of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. Analysts had expected American Express to
seek to raise about $750 million. Because the proposed public
offering is bigger than they expected, American Express's
stock could show weakness this morning, analysts said.
   American Express announced plans for the public offering
after it injected more than $1 billion into Shearson -- part
of a plan in which it will acquire all of Shearson's common
it doesn't already own. The move was a reversal for American
Express, which long had wanted to reduce its stake in the
struggling brokerage concern rather than increase it.
   John Keefe, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New
York, said American Express is basically "undoing
transactions that were laid down in years past." He added,
"They seem to do everything in the most complicated way
possible." As for Shearson's future, "The tough work is still
ahead," Mr. Keefe said.
   Nippon Life already owns four million shares of American
Express's $3.875 convertible exchangeable preferred,
convertible to common at $42.50 a share. After Nippon Life
acquires its 10 million shares, American Express said, it
will control about 4% of the 447 million shares then
outstanding.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Express shares closed at $30.375, up 25 cents.
   Nippon Life invested $508 million in Shearson Lehman
cumulative convertible voting preferred stock in April 1987.
As part of its purchase of American Express stock, Nippon
Life also will be granted warrants to purchase additional
Shearson stock at $15 a share.
   The new American Express shares will be sold by a
syndicate headed by Lehman Brothers, a division of Shearson
Lehman Hutton. Co -- managers in the U.S. will include Bear,
Stearns & Co.; Goldman, Sachs & Co.; Kidder, Peabody & Co.;
Lazard Freres; Morgan Stanley Inc.; and Salomon Brothers Inc.
This will be the first major underwriting by Lehman Brothers,
which was recently carved out of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   Altogether, American Express expects to sell 17.5 million
shares to the public, of which 12.5 million are being offered
domestically. Of the remainder, 3.5 million will be offered
to European investors and 1.5 million to Asian investors.
   For the first quarter, American Express reported a record
loss of $620 million, or $1.50 a share. All of the loss was
attributed to Shearson. In the offering prospectus, the
company says it expects Shearson to return to profitability
in the second quarter.
