   RICHMOND, Va. -- Ethyl Corp. said it agreed to buy Quantum
Chemical Corp.'s poly alpha olefin production plant in

   Terms of the agreement call for Quantum to operate the
plant for Ethyl. The unit, which has annual capacity of about
30 million gallons, will be Ethyl's first poly alpha olefin
plant in the U.S.
