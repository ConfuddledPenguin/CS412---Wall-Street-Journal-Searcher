   Tokos Medical Corp., a provider of specialized home health
care for pregnant women, said it agreed to acquire rival
Physiologic Diagnostic Service Inc. for 2.7 million shares of
Tokos common stock.
   Tokos, based in Santa Ana, Calif., went public in March.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, its stock
jumped $4.25 to $15 on turnover of 447,500 shares, giving the
transaction an indicated value of $40.5 million.

   Craig T. Davenport, Tokos president and chief operating
officer, said the two companies plan to combine their
clinical-research data, potentially quickening and expanding
regulatory approval for their home uterine-activity monitors.
   Physiologic Diagnostic, a privately owned company in
Atlanta, expects revenue of about $3.5 million this year, Mr.
Davenport said. Tokos, which is forecasting 1990 revenue of
about $75 million, expects to complete the acquisition by
mid-August.
