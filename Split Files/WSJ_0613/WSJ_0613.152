   WASHINGTON -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed
fining Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. $160,000 for the
company's alleged "willful violations" of NRC safety and
reporting requirements.
   The company has 30 days to respond to the proposed
penalty.

   The regulatory agency's findings relate to an air-ionizer
3M manufactured in the mid-1980s. By early 1988, the NRC
ordered a recall of some models of the ionizers, which
contained microscopic metal spheres that held particles of a
radioactive source, polonium 210.
   The recall was ordered after agency investigators found
that the ionizers, or static-removing devices, leaked
radioactivity at some customers' industrial plants. The
leakage was at levels so low that it didn't represent a
significant health hazard, and consumer products made at the
affected plants showed no contamination.
   The company later expanded the recall to include all
ionizer models containing the radioactive material, and
halted those models' production.
   The company said it is "surprised by the size of the
proposed penalty," given the company's cooperation and
compliance with NRC's requests. It is "studying the specifics
of the allegations and will respond."
   The NRC said it found seven violations. Among them, it
said 3M failed to make sure customers would use the devices
in "acceptable environments." It also said the company didn't
check returned ionizers for surface contamination, a process
that would identify any leaking devices that should be
classified unacceptable.
   The agency said 3M also failed to tell customers how the
leaking ionizers should be handled, and to provide the NRC
with complete reports.
