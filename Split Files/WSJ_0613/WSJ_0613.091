   TOKYO -- To understand what is happening in U.S.-Japan
relations today, it helps to look back to the late 1940s and
early 1950s, the waning days of the U.S. occupation.
   The U.S. was obsessed with a hot war against Communist
forces in Korea and a cold war against communism world-wide.
Japan was obsessed with rebuilding its economy and regaining
its sovereignty.

   In return for granting Japan its sovereignty, the U.S.
wanted base rights and a mutual-security agreement with its
former enemy. This horrified Japan's left-wingers, who wanted
their country to pursue "unarmed neutrality." The right wing
was willing to ally with the U.S. and even to rebuild Japan's
military to help the U.S. in Asia, but balked at the idea of
U.S. bases on Japanese soil.
   Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida set the course that Japan
has basically followed since. He accepted the U.S. bases, but
once the occupation ended he did everything he could to
resist Washington's urgings to rapidly rebuild the Japanese
military. He was accused in Japan of being a member of the
"pro-Anglo-American clique," but rejoined: "It would be more
correct to speak of `the clique that makes use of Britain and
the United States.'"
   Mr. Yoshida calculated that American bases and a sort of
"dependent independence" were the unavoidable price of
sovereignty. But he distrusted the Japanese military and
didn't think Japan could afford a military buildup. He wanted
his country to concentrate on industrial might.
   The U.S., seeing Japan as the key to its military position
in Asia, was eager to encourage this industrial buildup. It
sent advisers to Japan to help control inflation and improve
product quality, and it welcomed Japanese exports.
   Within years, Japan's economy was booming. By the early
1960s, some Japanese economic advisers were confident that
Japan could eventually become completely self-sufficient in
manufactured goods. When Caterpillar Inc. started a joint
venture in Japan with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in the
mid-1960s, it was startled to find that the Japanese could
build a factory twice as fast as Americans and use the plant
to make products of the highest quality.
   "When we first came here we thought that everything we
were doing in the U.S. had to be right," says Keith Johnson,
a Caterpillar man who worked on the joint venture's startup
and now runs it. "We learned in a hurry that wasn't right."
   Through the 1950s and 1960s, most of the strains on
U.S.-Japan relations were political. Pacifism was popular in
postwar Japan; the U.S.-Japan security treaty was a sore
point. Satuski Eda, an opposition-party member of the
Japanese Diet, vividly remembers leading fellow students from
Tokyo University in demonstrations against the treaty's
renewal in 1960. Riots forced President Eisenhower to cancel
a planned trip to Japan. "At the time," says Mr. Eda, "some
strong criticism existed in Japan against the U.S."
   By the early 1970s, political frictions were easing but
economic tensions were building. A spat had developed over
textiles, the first of many nasty trade clashes that would
punctuate U.S.-Japan relations for the next 20 years. Steel,
autos, machine tools, semiconductors -- again and again, the
U.S. and Japan went to the mat.
   Yet in most cases the U.S. was willing to accept Japanese
concessions that stopped far short of damaging Japan's
economic interests. Japan was still first and foremost a
security partner, and, to Washington, it wasn't worth
endangering the relationship for mere economic gain. Now,
with the Cold War over, that logic no longer holds. "These
days, power is defined more in economic terms than in
military terms," says Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat.
The Japanese are "trying to gain as much economic power as
they can. If we don't get with it, they might."
   Now voices on both sides are suggesting the relationship
between the U.S. and Japan needs to be rethought. The two
governments are groping for an alternative to military
security that would keep the two countries close -- hence the
Bush administration's "global partnership" rhetoric. But
public opinion on both sides seems ready for more daring
alternatives.
   In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, half of all
registered American voters said Japan should stake out a
foreign policy that is independent of the U.S. More and more
Japanese agree, though most still want a close relationship
with the U.S. Asked to name their nation's closest ally, 79%
of the Japanese responding to a Wall Street Journal-Nippon
Research poll picked the U.S.
