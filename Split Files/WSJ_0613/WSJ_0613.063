   NEW YORK -- The sequel to "Gone With the Wind" is gone
from the new book lineup -- for now.
   The sequel to the Margaret Mitchell Civil War classic was
supposed to be the big fall book from the Warner Books
division of Time Warner Inc. But Warner has quietly dropped
the book from its fall list, and it canceled a big party
scheduled to promote the sequel at the American Booksellers
Association convention in Las Vegas last week.

   The delay sparked rumors in the gossipy publishing world
that the book is poorly written and needs heavy rewriting.
   Warner Books denies that the book, which has been titled
"Scarlett: the Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the
Wind," is in trouble. Laurence Kirshbaum, president of Warner
Books, says the book is merely taking longer than planned and
"it just doesn't make sense to rush it out for fall. It's
only about 40% finished." He also dismisses rumors that the
sequel isn't up to par. "As one of three people who has read
what's done, I can tell you that it's excellent," he says.
   Warner was the winning bidder two years ago at an auction
of the sequel rights by the original author's estate, paying
a whopping $5 million. Mr. Kirshbaum says the company won't
pay the full amount until it accepts the final manuscript,
which is being written by romance novelist Alexandra Ripley.
Ms. Ripley was selected by the executors of the Mitchell
estate to write the sequel.
   "Gone With The Wind" ranks as one of the best-selling
books of all time, with more than 25 million copies sold
since its publication in 1936. Anticipation of the sequel is
high and so are the stakes for Warner Books, which must sell
more than 250,000 copies in hardcover to make a profit.
Warner already sold book club rights to the Literary Guild, a
unit of Bertelsmann AG for a sum that industry executives
estimate is more than $1 million.
   "Even if the manuscript is in real trouble, I'm sure
Warner won't talk about it," says Howard Kaminsky, chairman
of Hearst Corp.'s Trade Book Group. "It's such a big
investment, and they'll want to put the best face on it.
Everybody knows that for the first two weeks it comes out, it
will sell just on curiosity, but word of mouth will have to
carry it from there."
   Ms. Ripley, the author, doesn't have time to discuss her
project, because "she's hard at work," says her agent, Robert
Gottlieb of William Morris. But Mr. Gottlieb says Ms. Ripley
has written "about 1,000 pages" and it's taking so long
because "she wants it to be historically pure. She's been
looking at archives -- letters and newspapers from the
period." Asked about rumors that the plot involves Scarlett
O'Hara having a baby and moving to Ireland, where Rhett
Butler is running guns, Mr. Gottlieb replied: "I can't get
into a discussion about what's in the book, but part of what
you said is accurate."
   A lawyer representing the Mitchell estate in Atlanta, Paul
Anderson, said: "It's my understanding that the book has been
delayed, but I fully expect it to be published. It's a
staggering undertaking, so it wouldn't be surprising if there
were some delays."
   Mr. Anderson said the estate hasn't seen the manuscript
and doesn't have final approval of what is written.
   Asked whether he's worried about "Scarlett" getting bad
reviews or fizzling out after initial sales, Mr. Gottlieb,
the agent, seems unconcerned. Even if the book is less than
wonderful, he avows, "it will still sell a zillion copies.
I'm not worried about the future: I want the book to do well
when it's published."
   And what about the devout fans of "Gone with the Wind"?
Carolyn Roderick, a librarian in Pine Knoll Shores, N.C.,
says she read one of Ms. Ripley's earlier novels as soon as
she heard about the sequel. "I was very disappointed. I
couldn't finish the book, to be honest, and I'd just as soon
she didn't {write the sequel}," she says.
   But will she buy the book, even if it gets lousy reviews?
"Good, bad or indifferent, I'm sure I couldn't resist buying
it," says Ms. Roderick. "But I'll probably wait till it comes
out in paperback."
   Mr. Kirshbaum of Warner Books says he is now hoping to
publish "Scarlett" in hardcover next spring, "in time for
Mother's Day," and he thinks that will work out just fine.
"As Scarlett would say," adds Mr. Kirshbaum, " `Next season
is another season.'"
