   On stamps from Uncle Sam.
   I don't know how you feel, my dear,
   But frankly, I don't give a damn.

   In-Depths Observation
                                                                                                       

   If you find you've gotten in over your head
   You must try to rise above it,
   And stay right on top of the problem until
   You get to the bottom of it.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
