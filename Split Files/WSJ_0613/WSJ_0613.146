   The preliminary plan to acquire control of Integrated's
American Insured Mortgage Investors series of public
partnerships, which CRI Insured said hold a total of $642
million of federally insured mortgages, falls outside an
auction of the funds that is being overseen by the judge in
Integrated's bankruptcy proceedings in New York.
