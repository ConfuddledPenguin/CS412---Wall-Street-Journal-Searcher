   N.V. Philips and C. Olivetti &amp; Co. said they had ended
negotiations aimed at cooperating in the computer business.
   Analysts called the failure of the talks another blow to
Philips's flagging restructuring program, particularly
because the Dutch electronics company's unprofitable computer
business is viewed as one of its biggest problem areas. "They
need to do something quickly," said Bill Coleman, an analyst
at James Capel &amp; Co., London.

   Neither company would elaborate on the reasons for the
failure of the talks, which were first announced in April.
Industry analysts said they believed Olivetti had been
interested in acquiring control of the Philips computer
division in some form, but had concluded that such an
operation wouldn't make commercial sense at a time when the
industry is facing severe pressure on margins.
   The talks "were probably broken off by Olivetti after
looking at the core Philips business," said Dorian Foyil, an
analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, London. Analysts also said
there could have been problems concerning the Philips product
range and the potential cost of restructuring its operations.
   A Philips spokesman said the company is discussing
possible cooperation with other companies, but he refused to
elaborate. The company, based in the Netherlands, has been
even more tight-lipped than usual since mid-May, when it
announced a management shake-up under which its president,
Cornelis van der Klugt, agreed to leave the company July 1, a
year earlier than expected. His successor will be Jan Timmer,
who currently heads the consumer electronics division.
   Mr. van der Klugt has favored retaining control of the
computer business, which ranks 11th or 12th in Europe and is
considered by many analysts to be too small and ill-focused
to thrive on its own. At a news conference in March, Mr. van
der Klugt said Philips wanted to find a computer alliance
that would let the Dutch company "be masters in our own
house."
   Thus, some analysts speculated that an obstacle in the
talks with Olivetti might have been Philips's unwillingness
to give up enough control over its computer line.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Timmer will be more willing to
let go of the computer business than was Mr. van der Klugt.
But a Philips spokesman insisted that computers are "very
important" to the company, adding, "There is no intention to
step out of that business."
   Philips officials have long argued that the computer
division is closely linked to the company's technological
strengths in video screens and optical-storage systems. Some
analysts have argued, however, that Philips would be
well-positioned to market such technology even if it no
longer manufactured computers.
   Philips might provide some hints about its computer
strategy July 2, when shareholders attend an extraordinary
meeting to vote on the recent management changes. Analysts
are eagerly awaiting Mr. Timmer's comments at that meeting.
   He is widely viewed as willing to make tough decisions. "I
think he'll be a man in a hurry," Capel's Mr. Coleman said.
   Olivetti also is expected to continue looking at other
possible alliances. The Italian company's chairman, Carlo De
Benedetti, said recently that it was interested in forging
accords either to acquire technology on a sector-by-sector
basis or to win market share. Company officials have said it
is keeping various options open through contacts in the
industry.
   Olivetti's consolidated net profit last year fell 43% to
202.8 billion lire ($163 million) from 356.2 billion lire in
1988, despite a 7.4% rise in sales.
