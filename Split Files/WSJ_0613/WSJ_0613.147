   BLOOMFIELD, Conn. -- Kaman Corp. signed a joint-venture
agreement with Societe Nationale des Poudres Explosifs of
Paris to develop defense and industrial products using
so-called insensitive explosive-materials technology.
   The venture, called Advanced Energetic Materials Corp. of
America, will be based in the U.S. Each company will hold a
50% stake in the endeavor.

   Kaman, a defense contractor, said the joint venture
intends to develop cost-effective products to improve defense
capabilities of armored vehicles against munitions attacks.
Kaman said the products will use explosive materials
developed by the French company that are highly stable during
handling and operating conditions. Societe Nationale is a
specialty chemicals and advanced materials concern.
   The two companies have worked together on related research
since 1986, Kaman said. Developing products based on the
research "is the next logical step," said Richard E.W. Smith,
vice president of Kaman. Mr. Smith will be president of the
joint venture.
   Kaman said it is too early to estimate annual revenues
from the venture.
