   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc. said two
French airlines, UTA and Air France, have selected its new
laser gyro inertial navigation system for their future fleets
of Airbus Industrie A-340 aircraft. Financial terms weren't
disclosed.
   The airlines are scheduled to take delivery of the
aircraft beginning in October 1992, and each of these
jetliners built by the European aircraft consortium will be
equipped with three of the navigation systems, known as
Flagship, and associated equipment.
