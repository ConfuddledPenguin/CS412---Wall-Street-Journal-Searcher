   NEW YORK -- U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Harold F. White
approved the appointment of Barry L. Zaretsky, a Brooklyn Law
School professor and counsel to the international law firm of
Kelley Drye &amp; Warren, as examiner in the Revco Drugstores
bankruptcy case, according to the law firm.
   Appointment of an examiner in the case was requested by
U.S. Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern.

   The law firm said that Prof. Zaretsky, with Kelley Drye as
his counsel, will investigate the failed $1.25 billion
management-led leveraged buy-out of the 2,000-drugstore
chain. It was the first major junk-bond-financed LBO to enter
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code under which a company is
given protection from creditors while it tries to work out a
plan for paying its debts.
   Prof. Zaretsky will seek to determine whether the Revco
LBO involved fraud and is to submit a preliminary report July
16.
   The law firm said that if Prof. Zaretsky's investigation
finds that the LBO was fraudulent and if the courts
ultimately uphold such findings, it would further jeopardize
junk-bond-financed LBOs as a method of corporate acquisition.
The law firm added that if fraud is found in the Revco case,
it could retroactively call into question billions of dollars
of LBO debt outstanding.
