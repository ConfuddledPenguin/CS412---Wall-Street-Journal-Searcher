   WASHINGTON -- The Senate failed by a margin of two votes
to override President Bush's veto of an Amtrak-authorization
bill in a hard-fought battle over a regulatory provision that
provoked intense lobbying from unions and parts of the
railroad industry.
   Ten Republicans joined all 55 Democrats on the initial
motion to override, and Majority Leader George Mitchell
served notice that he would retain the right to force a
second vote if sufficient support can be found to reverse the
outcome.

   The evening roll call followed a strenuous administration
lobbying campaign spearheaded by Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner in a striking partnership with Drew Lewis, a
former transportation secretary and current chairman and
chief executive officer of Union Pacific Corp. At one point,
Mr. Skinner and Mr. Lewis, working from Mr. Skinner's office,
placed a conference call to Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.),
giving the senator the opportunity, he joked later, to talk
to past and present transportation secretaries at the same
time.
   The Senate action came as a House Appropriations
subcommittee approved a $83.6 billion veterans, space and
housing bill providing more than $2.25 billion for the space
station in fiscal 1991 but denying most of the Bush
administration's request for its moon and Mars initiative.
   President Bush, in vetoing the Amtrak legislation last
month, objected not to the spending authorization but to a
requirement that tightened Interstate Commerce Commission
regulation of freight-railroad takeovers. Last week, the
House voted 294-123 to override him. The fate of the
legislation, which would authorize $2 billion for Amtrak over
three years is unclear. The president would sign
stripped-down legislation, according to White House
officials, but House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
John Dingell (D., Mich.) has warned that he wouldn't support
quick enactment of legislation that didn't contain the ICC
provision.
   The ICC, under the disputed provision, would have the
authority to review the proposed takeover of any of the
nation's 16 largest freight railroads by non-rail companies.
The commission already has the authority to review
acquisitions of railroads by other railroads. Proponents,
including rail unions, said the ICC provision closed a
loophole in current law.
   Thirty-five Republicans stood with Mr. Bush in the fight,
and within party ranks, there was strong pressure to uphold
Mr. Bush's string of victories on veto fights. And among the
most high-profile conversions was Sen. Larry Pressler, who
had been an early supporter of the regulatory provision and
had signed the conference report on the Amtrak bill. "We
don't have Amtrak in South Dakota," said Mr. Pressler later,
but his apparent reversal angered proponents of the bill.
"The president vetoed Pressler's bill, and Pressler supported
him," said Sen. James Exon (D. Neb.).
   Within the House appropriations bill yesterday, the rising
costs of the space station helped to boost total funding for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration above $14
billion. But within these totals, the subcommittee lists
about $314 million in reductions from the ambitious moon and
Mars program.
   The high-speed national aerospace plane, which was cut
severely by the same panel last year, escaped with only
modest reductions by comparison. And preliminary numbers
indicated NASA's share of the program would grow to about
$114 million in the new budget year beginning Oct. 1.
Elsewhere in NASA, the bill makes only modest reductions from
the costly, large satellite Earth-observing system program
for which General Electric Co. is a major contractor. But $10
million would be shifted to boost significantly the smaller
satellite "Earth probes" program to $35 million, with much of
the new money targeted to the so-called TOMS ozone-mapping
spectrometer project.
   Within the National Science Foundation, research funding
would rise by nearly 9% to $1.85 billion, $100 million below
the president's budget. The subcommittee chose to put more
emphasis on science and engineering education funding, which
would grow by almost 40% to $285 million.
   Among major domestic accounts, the measure provides $12.3
billion for veterans medical care, a 7.8% increase over
fiscal 1990. And federal contributions for assisted housing
for elderly and low-income households would grow sharply to
$11.6 billion. The new figure represents an estimated 47%
increase above current funding and includes a major expansion
of available housing for poor families and $2.7 billion for
public housing modernization, $850 million above the
administration's request.
   Within the Environmental Protection Agency, abatement,
control and compliance accounts would total more than $1
billion, a 25% increase over current funding. And the bill
rejects proposed cuts by the administration in water and
sewer construction grants, which would be roughly frozen near
$2 billion.
   Separately, the House Judiciary Committee authorized $110
million for the Justice Department to prosecute thrift fraud
in fiscal 1991, roughly doubling the amount requested by the
Bush administration.
   The judiciary panel's action was part of an overall $7.4
billion Justice Department authorization for the year
beginning Oct. 1. Congress hasn't passed an authorization
bill for the Justice Department since 1980, implicitly
leaving the establishment of priorities to the appropriations
stage of the budget process. Committee Chairman Jack Brooks
(D., Texas) has said he will try to push through an
authorization bill this year as a way of holding the
department more accountable to Congress.
