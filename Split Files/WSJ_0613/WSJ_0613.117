   NEW YORK -- The Grolier Inc. unit of Paris-based Hachette
S.A. said it created a division to publish general-interest
books on family issues, and named Judith Rothman, 48 years
old, to run it.
   Ms. Rothman, who has held executive posts at numerous
college textbook publishers, including the college division
of Harper &amp; Row, will be publisher of the new Grolier Press.
She said Grolier Press will launch a first list of 25 to 35
books, then expand the number of titles, while continuing to
focus on hard-cover and paperback books for parents.

   "This fits well with the other publishing activities of
Grolier," Ms. Rothman said. "They publish encyclopedias,
school and library books, and run a children's book club.
Parents are their market, and ours too, and we can get help
from Grolier's direct-marketing organization. We will cover
parenting issues and also do things like child-activity
books."
