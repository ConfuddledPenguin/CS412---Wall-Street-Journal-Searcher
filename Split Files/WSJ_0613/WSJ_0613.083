   SAN DIEGO -- HomeFed Corp., a big and heretofore
apparently fairly healthy thrift, said its nonperforming
assets jumped $81 million in May, on top of a surprise $44
million increase in April.
   HomeFed had said earlier in the year that it hoped to cut
total nonperforming assets to below $400 million by year end.
But the May increase brought HomeFed's nonperforming assets
-- mainly bad loans and repossessed real estate -- to $579
million, or 3.12% of total assets. Moreover, Robert Adelizzi,
president and chief executive officer, said nonperforming
assets would probably rise further in June.

   Consequently, HomeFed will find it "extremely difficult"
to meet the publicly stated objective of trimming
nonperforming asset to below $400 million by year end, Mr.
Adelizzi said.
   HomeFed, boosted by big profits in its real estate
development unit, had been among the industry's better
performers lately. The surge in bad assets underscores the
difficulty even healthier thrifts are having coping with the
broad problems buffeting the S&amp;L industry, primarily as a
result of woebegone real estate markets in Texas, Arizona and
many other areas.
   HomeFed said sour loans accounted for $72 million of the
May increase in nonperforming assets, with the remainder
consisting of foreclosed real estate. The thrift's problem
assets are now approaching the relatively high levels of last
fall, but Mr. Adelizzi said the thrift is more concerned
about its portfolio than it was then because of worries about
the "overbuilt condition of commercial real estate markets
nationally and certain multifamily markets outside of
California."
   He said HomeFed now is conducting a special review of all
its large loans, and said that the rising levels of
nonperforming assets and any additional problems that the
review may unearth could lead to increases in its provisions
for loan losses in the second quarter. HomeFed didn't
disclose what impact that might have on earnings, but any
increase in its provision for loan losses would drag down
HomeFed's results. In the first quarter, HomeFed had net
income of $34.5 million, or $1.62 a share.
   HomeFed has tangible capital of about 5.03% of assets --
one of the better ratios among large thrifts -- and thus can
weather some deterioration in its portfolio. Nonetheless,
May's surge in bad assets clearly troubled Mr. Adelizzi. He
said the thrift was "disappointed" by the increase, adding:
"We did not feel that April's {increase in bad assets} was
indicative of a trend."
   HomeFed announced the jump in bad assets after the market
closed. In New York Stock Exchange trading, its stock
finished at $33.25, down 37.5 cents.
