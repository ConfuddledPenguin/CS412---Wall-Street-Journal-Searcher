   When Ronald Reagan promised to share strategic defense
technology with the Soviet Union, the skeptics said he was
crazy. Well, maybe the Soviets will once again prove that the
Gipper was crazy like a fox.
   At the recent Washington summit, the Soviet Union for the
first time agreed to talk about "the relationship between
strategic offensive and defensive arms." Those talks would
include "reductions in strategic offensive arms and
development of new technologies," according to a joint
U.S.-Soviet statement. This may not sound like much, but
several U.S. officials think it's a conceptual breakthrough.
The Soviets wanted the U.S. to commit to arms control beyond
START-I, and in return the Soviets finally agreed to talk
about strategic defense outside the narrow confines of the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

   In other words, "new thinking" continues to spread to the
animist religion of nuclear deterrence. For years that faith
has said that defending against nuclear weapons is heresy;
only "offensive" systems can keep the peace by threatening to
blow up everyone equally. Apart from its moral problems, that
doctrine has suffered under the development of advanced new
technology, symbolized by the U.S. SDI program. Now even many
Soviets are challenging that orthodoxy.
   Keith Payne, president of the National Institute for
Public Policy, has been keeping track of a remarkable new
strategic debate in the Soviet Union. Freed by glasnost,
strategists are emerging who think the U.S.S.R. needs its own
SDI.
   In the December 1989 issue of Soviet Military Review,
Mikhail Aleksandrov of the Soviet Foreign Ministry says that
anti-nuclear defenses "may, far from leading to
destabilization, result in a better model of strategic
stability than the one we have." Ronald Reagan liked to make
the same point.
   In March 1989, another Foreign Ministry official, Ednan
Agayev, even questioned the value of the ABM Treaty. He
wrote, "in order to get to the truth it is necessary to call
everything in question. And hasn't the present `offensive
deterrence' been long ripe for that? The only modern
deterrence is defensive."
   Even the Soviet military has joined the debate. In the
March 23, 1990, issue of Sovetskaya Rossiya, Maj. Gen. V.
Belous writes, "We should hardly deny the possibility of
reasonable compromises in the future and development of
defenses for U.S. and U.S.S.R. territory against accidental
missile launches or blackmail attempts and threats made by
third countries." General Belous knows that missiles from
Iraq or some future Republic of Armenia could reach Moscow
long before they'll have the range to hit Manhattan. (Defense
Secretary Cheney said Monday that by the year 2000, 15
countries will produce ballistic missiles, including Iraq,
Iran, Syria, Libya and North Korea.)
   This "new thinking" is hardly a consensus yet, and it's
possible to make too much of one summit statement. Official
Soviet negotiators still say they won't accept a U.S. space
defense. But negotiators are always the last to know. More
open minds in Moscow seem to understand that the technology
is moving, that they've so far failed to kill SDI, and so why
not cooperate so that both sides can have defenses?
   It may also be that the Soviets pay more attention to
SDI's technical progress than the Washington press corps
does. The pace of SDI tests is picking up, with boffo
results. Two SDI satellites are currently in orbit testing
lasers in the atmosphere and bouncing them off mirrors in
space and back to Hawaii. In January, the HEDI ground-to-air
missile interceptor made its first successful test. In April,
a laser radar proved that it could distinguish a decoy from a
real missile in microseconds.
   Sometime this summer, the Pentagon plans its first flight
test of a "brilliant pebble," the small interceptor that
might someday be deployed by the hundreds in space. Every new
development in electronics -- Hitachi just announced a
prototype computer chip with 64 million bits -- makes it
easier for SDI scientists to pack more computing power onto a
pebble-like satellite for less money. Because they'd float in
earth orbit, pebbles could also just as easily protect the
Soviet Union as the U.S.
   The enemy of this progress now is old thinking in both the
U.S. and U.S.S.R. Secretary Cheney had to fight colleagues
(Brent Scowcroft) to get the U.S. even to argue at the summit
for the new defense language. Many in Congress want to raid
SDI to build more tanks and planes, though research spending
is far more useful in peacetime. Old thinking dies hard, but
on SDI its days are numbered.
