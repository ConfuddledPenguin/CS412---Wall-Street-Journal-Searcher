   Chrysler Corp. may be trying to acquire one of the few
major independent car-rental companies left in the U.S.,
closely held Dollar Rent-a-Car Systems Inc.
   Chrysler and Dollar officials confirmed there have been
talks between the two, but company spokesmen refused to give
any details. It couldn't immediately be determined whether
Chrysler may be seeking to buy all or part of Dollar.

   A Chrysler spokesman refused yesterday to comment on
"rumor and speculation," but didn't deny the two companies
are in discussions. A spokesman for Dollar in Los Angeles
said there's "nothing concrete" on which he could comment.
   "I think they are reasonably close" to an agreement, said
rental car industry analyst Charles H. Finnie of Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons, Inc. in Baltimore.
   Acquiring all or part of Dollar would potentially give
Chrysler a dedicated, high-volume customer for its vehicles.
Dollar buys about 70,000 to 80,000 cars a year, company
officials had said.
   Because car-rental agencies buy autos in high volume, U.S.
car makers have been rushing to form alliances with them in
an attempt to lock up markets for their cars and squeeze
Japanese auto makers out of these markets. But in May,
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. became the first Japanese auto maker
to buy a stake in a U.S. rental car company when it acquired
a majority of Value Rent-a-Car Inc. of Deerfield Beach, Fla.
   Ford Motor Co. has put money into Hertz Corp. and Budget
Rent A Car Corp.
   General Motors Corp. has done the same with Avis Inc. and
National Car Rental System Inc. Chrysler owns Thrifty
Rent-A-Car System Inc. and Snappy Rental Inc. Remaining major
independents include Alamo Rent A Car Inc. and Enterprise
Rent A Car Inc., two closely held concerns.
   But Chrysler lately has had trouble making the
"buy-your-customer" strategy work smoothly at Thrifty, the
rental agency it purchased last year in a transaction valued
at $263 million. Earlier this year, Chrysler allowed Thrifty
to buy about 4,000 cars from Mitsubishi after Chrysler
officials conceded they couldn't match Mitsubishi's prices
and weren't prepared to order Thrifty to pay more for
Chrysler-built vehicles.
   It's not clear how much Dollar would fetch in a sale. The
company has been closely held for more than 22 years, but
analysts estimate the company's revenue at between $300
million and $350 million. Dollar officials have said they are
bigger than Thrifty was at the time Chrysler acquired it last
year.
   Despite the problems with Thrifty, buying Dollar would
"make sense for Chrysler," because Dollar would give Chrysler
access to the "on-airport" segment of the car rental
industry, Mr. Finnie said. On-airport agencies such as Dollar
have rental locations on airport property, and thus are
typically favored by business travelers on expense accounts.
