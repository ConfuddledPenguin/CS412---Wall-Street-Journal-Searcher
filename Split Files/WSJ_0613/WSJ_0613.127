   Western Union Corp., New York, debt-laden and struggling
to avoid bankruptcy court, again revised its proposed
recapitalization plan to satisfy its bondholders.
   The communications and financial services company now
wants to offer a different package of debt securities and
common shares to holders of its 19.25% senior secured reset
notes due Dec. 15, 1992, and to holders of its 16% notes due
June 15, 1991. The revision affects $530 million of debt.
Western Union is also seeking to reclassify its preferred
stock into new common shares.

   In the latest revision, the company seeks to change the
principal amounts of two new notes and plans to offer a
different mix of common, Class C and Class D shares, in
exchange for each $1,000 face value of the 19.25% and 16%
notes. In addition, Western Union is seeking a change in
interest payment terms on one new note, including the rate
and form of payment.
