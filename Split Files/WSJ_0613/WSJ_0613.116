   TULSA, Okla. -- Kinark Corp. said three directors have
been elected to its eight-member board, including two
candidates who opposed Kinark's nominees.
   Elected were Garry Brainin, chairman and president of
Altair Corp., and George B. Collins, Altair's assistant
secretary. But a third Altair candidate was defeated by
Kinark nominee Ivan Himmel, chairman of Chicago-based
Maritime Partners Limited Partnership. Maritime is Kinark's
second-largest stockholder, with 7.8% of the common shares,
while Altair is third, with 6.7%.

   Paul Chastain, Kinark's deputy chief executive officer,
said the Altair slate was pressing for more aggressive growth
by the company, which owns galvanizing plants and
chemical-storage facilities. The previous board rejected last
month an unsolicited $24.8 million offer from Steel Partners
Limited Partnership, but said it would consider additional
proposals. Mr. Chastain wouldn't comment on how the new board
would respond to such offers.
   Messrs. Brainin and Collins couldn't be reached for
comment.
