   Thomas J. Watson Jr., the famed former chairman of
International Business Machines Corp., does a remarkable
thing in his memoirs: He tells the truth.
   At a time when many prominent executives are churning out
books that exaggerate their importance, Mr. Watson spends
much of the book debunking the myths that have grown up
around him. He disparages his intellect, regrets his temper,
rues his treatment of his family.

   Mr. Watson, now 76 years old, is widely credited with
producing a brilliant insight that brought IBM into the
computer age in the 1950s. Popular wisdom adds that he first
had to battle his aging father, the company's founder, who
supposedly said there'd never be a market for more than 50
computers. In fact, Watson Jr. says the two never fought over
the issue; the move happened too gradually to produce a big
argument. Mr. Watson -- who has mellowed since he had a heart
attack and retired 20 years ago -- adds that others deserve
at least as much credit for the move as he does and says no
one at IBM grasped 1% of the computer's potential in those
days.
   "Father Son &amp; Co.: My Life at IBM and Beyond" (Bantam, 468
pages, $22.95), cowritten with Peter Petre of Fortune
magazine, also makes a couple of surprising admissions about
IBM. For instance, Mr. Watson says the antitrust suit that
the Justice Department filed in 1969, though fought tooth and
nail by IBM, "had merit. IBM was clearly in a commanding
position in the market, and some of our tactics had been
harsh." He says he was willing to split IBM in half. The suit
was dropped in 1982.
   As refreshing as the candor is, though, Messrs. Watson and
Petre do still another smart thing. They realize that the
world isn't crying out for another history of IBM, so the
memoirs are written as the story of a father and son -- in
this case, a worldbeater of a father and a talented but
haunted son, who loved each other but ended up wrestling over
one of the world's great corporations.
   Mr. Watson, a slow starter, says he was known as "Terrible
Tommy" as a child. He once bought some skunk stink glands and
placed them in his school's ventilation system, forcing the
principal to send everyone home -- "It was my moment of
ultimate triumph," he writes. Mr. Watson double-bogeyed high
school, taking six years to get through. As a young adult,
the pomposity at a dinner party so enraged him that he got a
garden hose and watered everyone down.
   Watson Sr. tried to bring his son along in the business,
but Watson Jr. felt demeaned. He complains that he was once
given a sales territory so plush that he reached his annual
quota on Jan. 2.
   After his time as a pilot in World War II did wonders for
his self-esteem, Mr. Watson started to take on significant
responsibilities. He takes -- and deserves -- credit for
purging IBM of its small-company mentality so it could grow
into the colossus it is today. But his father tested his
mettle at every turn, leading to battles that were "savage,
primeval and unstoppable." After one nasty session, Mr.
Watson stormed off for the airport, but his father followed
him. With a crowd watching on the tarmac, Watson Jr. tore his
arm away from his frail father and bellowed, "Damn you, old
man] Can't you ever leave me alone?"
   Even after Watson Sr. died, the son remained haunted by
his father's presence and by the pressures of running his
burgeoning business in a fast-changing market. Mr. Watson
would argue with his wife and children, then fall into
depressions and sometimes lock himself in his dressing room
at home. His wife, Olive, eventually moved out and hired a
divorce lawyer, before relenting.
   The book's sole problem is that it's about 40 pages too
long. Mr. Watson provides too many particulars about his war
years. For a man who has been prominent as long as Mr. Watson
has, he also does a surprising amount of star-gazing. He
writes breathlessly, for instance, about giving plane rides
to Harry Truman and Jackie Kennedy.
   But Mr. Watson never digresses for long and often comes
back with a snap. He writes overlong, for instance, about
airlifts in the Soviet Union and China during World War II.
But then Mr. Watson volunteers to fly as an observer on a
mission over the Himalayas, and things pick up again. In
horrible weather, they fly so low that comparing the
altimeter to the charts indicates they're flying underground.
Below are the carcasses of planes that didn't make it. They
run into solid fog and Mr. Watson gives up, bracing himself
for the crash. The pilot says, "What the hell? You want to
live forever?"
   My real gripe is with the book's publicity, which is
billing Mr. Watson as "the man Fortune magazine called `the
most successful capitalist in history.'" He ranks right up
there, but let's be fair: That quote comes from the
introduction to a piece Messrs. Watson and Petre wrote three
years ago. My brother and I once did a loving piece in this
newspaper about our mother, but that doesn't mean we quote
The Wall Street Journal as saying she's the greatest mother
who ever lived.
