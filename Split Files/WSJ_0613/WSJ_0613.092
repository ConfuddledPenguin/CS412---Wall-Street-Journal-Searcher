   David Frum may be one of the most arrogant Canada pundits
I have ever encountered ("Canada? Who'd Want It?" editorial
page, May 17). Not only does his article assume that the
imminent dissolution of Canada is an issue for American
public policy, but also by citing that many Canadians feel
they are Quebecois or British Columbian or Ontarian first and
Canadian second it intimates that our political culture is
somehow deficient -- or, at least, inferior to that of the
U.S.
   As a Canadian who was born in Alberta and who grew up in
Europe, Canada (Ontario and Quebec) and the U.S., I may have
a bias of my own in saying that what makes Canada different
and, dare I say it, exciting, is this very diversity Mr. Frum
so impugns.

   Our political culture is no less paradoxical than that of
the U.S.: The national government has no "right" to spend any
transfer payments in economically depressed regions without
the support of the other wealthier provinces or states, but
only the national government can effect macroeconomic policy.
In Canada as in the U.S., the government is an arbiter of the
"national" interest. I haven't yet come across any government
that is seen as objective in that role. It seems that the
best we can hope for is consistency.
   Canada is all about nationalism. Our patriotism and
identity are not at issue; why should the U.S. government not
continue to support Canadian unity? This is not a U.S.
public-policy issue. It is a slander on one of the most
healthily vibrant political cultures in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
   If the political pendulum were to swing Quebec out of
confederation, it would be politically disabling, but I have
more faith in Canada than does Mr. Frum. Only a vocal
minority of Canadians, with the possible exception of the
Quebecois given current realities, would actually take
separatism to a reality. Even in Quebec, where separatist
sentiments are as much a part of Canada's 20th-century
history as foreign-policy parochialism has been of America's,
I have a feeling an accommodation is required that transcends
Meech Lake-Quebec will never separate, as such. Besides, as
the U.S. becomes evermore a flagging economic power with a
reputation for reactionism and impotency on the world
political stage, who'd want it?

   Mr. Frum's comments about Manitoba are not representative
of the structure or performance of the province's diversified
economy, which has an annual output exceeding $24 billion,
well-developed manufacturing and service sectors, and
abundant natural resources. The primary sector, including
agriculture, mining and hydroelectric power production,
constitutes 13% of real gross domestic product (GDP),
marginally above the 12% national share. This belies the
author's characterization of Manitoba as an economically
depressed farming province.
   Manitoba's economic growth in nominal dollars virtually
matched the national average in the 1980s. In the past two
years, growth in nonresidential investment spending has been
a particularly strong indicator of business confidence in the
province.

   Mr. Frum correctly notes that Ontario, with one-third of
the nation's population, is deeply committed to national
unity. He goes on, however to call Premier David Peterson's
Liberal government "among the most profligate in the
developed world," citing Ontario's spending on social
programs as proof.
   Mr. Frum fails to note that Ontario's social programs have
been delivered for the past two years within the context of a
balanced budget. In fact, what Ontario's experience proves is
that good government can deliver a high level of services
while maintaining fiscal discipline and promoting economic
development. This combination of fiscal responsibility and
social responsiveness marks a record of prudence, not
profligacy.

   I very much enjoyed Mr. Frum's article. I have only one
question. If Canada goes out of business, can we have its
national anthem?

   Mr. Frum is one of these brash youngsters who go down to
New York City and discover red suspenders. For instance, he
supports an assertion that Quebec is the most statist place
in North America, on the basis of three dubious facts. The
Quebec electric utility is state owned, as it is in most
other Canadian provinces and in several areas of the U.S.
(e.g., Tennessee Valley Authority). Second, the province's
technology industry, especially aerospace, is said to "depend
on government funding." Where did he get that? The biggest
aerospace employers in Quebec, accounting for most of the
jobs in the sector, are Pratt &amp; Whitney, which makes small
turbine engines; Canadair, an aircraft manufacturer that
derives 90% of its revenue from civilian markets, mostly
abroad; Rolls-Royce, which has a big engine-rehaul plant in
Montreal; and CAE, which makes flight simulators for the
civilian transport industry. Indeed, one can make a good case
that the Quebec aerospace industry depends less on government
business than that of New England or Southern California.
   Using carefully selected "facts" Mr. Frum then goes on to
paint a catastrophic picture of Quebec language laws. This is
just like an old friend of mine who used to argue, over a 1
a.m. beer, that the U.S. was a police state because
Pittsburgh policemen were fat and wore their guns on their
hips, police could knock on your door at 11 p.m., and eight
of the nine Supreme Court Justices were white.
   Mr. Frum's flippancy also does a disservice to Atlantic
Canada and Western Canada with the same type of flimsy
arguments. That Canada has constitutional travails is
undoubtedly correct, but it remains a very civil society,
with less poverty than in the U.S., and a higher growth rate
than the U.S. for the past decade. Moreover, any
English-speaking person is free to walk safely, day and
night, in any French-speaking neighborhood of any Canadian
city, or of any neighborhood for that matter.

   Mr. Frum says that Ontarians "note that the world's
richest countries -- Sweden, Switzerland, Austria -- tend to
be compact and homogeneous places, not . . . federal states .
. ." Switzerland is a particularly poor example for a
"homogeneous state." It has four official languages: French,
German, Italian, and Romansch. The Catholic and Protestant
population is divided about evenly. The Swiss Federation
consists of 20 full cantons and six half-cantons, which have
a great deal of autonomy. In short, Canada has less diversity
within its borders than Switzerland.

   Manitoba and Saskatchewan have indeed, in the past,
sometimes voted for provincial governments led by the New
Democratic Party (meaning "socialist" to your correspondent).
At present, Saskatchewan has a majority Conservative Party
government, while Manitoba has a minority Conservative
government.
   More generally, the tone of the article is highly
prejudicial to anything that is Canadian. Fully 5% of
Quebec's GDP may indeed be generated by Hydro Quebec ("one
giant state-owned company"). But Mr. Frum fails to mention
that Hydro Quebec is among the lowest-cost
electricity-generating companies in North America, with
export contracts guaranteeing power supplies for various
Northeastern states of the U.S. into the next century. He
gleefully lists the "dying industries" of Quebec, without
mentioning the automotive, forest-based, aluminum, mining and
other sectors.

   Mr. Frum omits any mention of "North of Sixty" (the vast
area above the 60th parallel, North America's resource-rich
"Siberia," the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, loaded
with minerals, timber, wildlife, fish and water (and of
course, the mosquito and black-fly hordes, guardians of these
jewels).
   The writer needs to think beyond today's social problems,
beyond short-term bottom lines and to think of tomorrow and
our fatally diminishing natural (read: industrial) resources.
Disregarding almost 40% of Canadian geography suggests a
rather poor grasp of the subject or of trying to make a point
by tailoring economic fact to fit the neat journalistic theme
of this article: a blasting drumbeat of negativisms.

   A far more sensible question is, "Who wouldn't want a
huge, rich land lightly populated with well-educated people?"
Addition of Canada to the Union has been a universal desire
of U.S. patriots from the time of Benjamin Franklin, who in
1775 served on a commission that tried to persuade Quebec to
join the Revolution. Walt Whitman wrote glowingly of the
possibilities of one great land without borders.
   Is Mr. Frum a Canadian nationalist parading as a Yank to
work mischief from within a U.S. publication of wide
circulation? It is clearly in the U.S.'s national interest
that Canada join the Union. If Canada breaks up, most or all
of its pieces would apply for statehood, and statehood would
be granted, since polls of public opinion have consistently
demonstrated that between two-thirds and three-fourths of
Yanks favor welcoming Canada into the Union, as Mr. Frum
surely knows -- though he conveniently omits such statistics.
