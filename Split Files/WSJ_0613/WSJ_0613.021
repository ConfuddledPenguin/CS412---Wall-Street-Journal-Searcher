   New York -- According to the power press here, American
Ballet Theatre currently is in the process of "reclaiming its
soul." "Soul," of course, has never been easy to define.
However, in this case it probably signifies little more than
the state of bliss in which, according to some, ABT existed
before 1980. That year Mikhail Baryshnikov took over as
director from Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith and, many believe,
betrayed the company's spirit.
   Among those who subscribe to this view of ABT's recent
history, it would appear, are Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith,
the team that supplanted Mr. Baryshnikov last year.
Apparently forgetting that Mr. Baryshnikov was brought in to
rescue ABT from the artistic chaos to which his immediate
predecessors had reduced it, Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith now
are busy trying to dismantle his accomplishments.

   To this end, they have repudiated Mr. Baryshnikov's
attempts to create a genuine ensemble in place of what was
essentially a showcase for visiting stars; his efforts to
extend the company's artistic reach by engaging modern-dance
choreographers such as Merce Cunningham, Twyla Tharp, Karole
Armitage and Mark Morris; his partiality for the ballets of
George Balanchine; his determination to place greater
emphasis on classical than on demi-caractere dancing. While
there hasn't been enough time for the new administration to
eradicate all evidence of its predecessor's taste -- the
general outlines of ABT's current season at the Metropolitan
Opera House were devised by Mr. Baryshnikov before his
precipitous departure -- the artistic orientation of Ms.
Hermann and Mr. Smith has begun to manifest itself.
   For one thing, guest artists, abjured for the most part
since 1980, are again very much in evidence. Fernando
Bujones, who left ABT after a disagreement with Mr.
Baryshnikov, returned for "Black Swan," "Giselle" and "The
Sleeping Beauty." In the last, he partnered Ludmila
Semenyaka, flown in from the U.S.S.R. at short notice to
replace an injured Cynthia Gregory. Ekaterina Maximova and
Vladimir Vasiliev, from the Bolshoi, danced a single
"Giselle," and Ms. Maximova also performed Mr. Vasiliev's
brief "Elegie."
   None of these appearances were exactly satisfying: Ms.
Maximova, after all, is 51, and Mr. Vasiliev 50. Mr. Bujones,
though merely 35, also has passed his zenith. As for Ms.
Semenyaka, her dancing is only too clearly characterized by
the unmusicality and technical weaknesses of Leningrad's
Kirov, where she began her career, and the affectations of
Moscow's Bolshoi, where she is the ranking ballerina.
   Whether or not such guests are good for the box office is
far from certain. That they are bad for the company's
artistic standing can hardly be doubted. Not only do they
undermine what remains of the stylistic coherence Mr.
Baryshnikov was trying to instill into ABT, they also serve
to derogate the importance of choreography. Like the old
duumvirate, the new one prefers to promote the cult of
personality over the art of dance. To see the shambles Ms.
Semenyaka made of the text -- not to mention the spirit -- of
"The Sleeping Beauty" should be warning enough of the dire
consequences of casting by publicity value instead of
capability. Ms. Maximova and Mr. Vasiliev are artistically
far superior to Ms. Semenyaka, but they have little to offer
a company in desperate need of aesthetic direction.
   Ms. Maximova and Mr. Vasiliev at least excited the
audience, many of whom, no doubt, remembered the pair from
their days of glory. Ms. Semenyaka, on the other hand, left
the house cold. So, invariably, does the company's newly
engaged premier danseur Faruk Ruzimatov, formerly of the
Kirov Ballet. Mr. Ruzimatov made his New York debut with the
company in "Giselle," followed two weeks later by "Bayadere,
Act II." Both roles cruelly expose his technical weakness.
They also expose his lack of magnetism.
   It's true that the very first sight of him is enough to
produce gasps from the audience, an expectant hush, a round
of applause. But, then, few dancers at ABT have ever adopted
so startlingly tragic a demeanor, kept their mouths so
constantly open, as if in perpetual self-astonishment, or
worn such heavy eye makeup. It's when Mr. Ruzimatov starts to
dance that the enthusiasm dwindles -- as it noticeably did on
both occasions.
   In Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" and, especially,
"Stravinsky Violin Concerto," Mr. Ruzimatov fell even
flatter. The technical demands made by abstract works like
these cannot be finessed by adopting an air of tragic
suffering -- as to some extent they can be in certain
narrative or situational ballets -- and the Soviet dancer was
forced to simplify the steps in a way that sabotaged the
choreographer's patent intentions. In "Stravinsky Violin
Concerto," there was a certain amount of diversion in seeing
someone so completely out of place -- Mr. Ruzimatov danced
this bracingly astringent work as if he were thinking about
the Last Judgment -- but that was hardly enough to save the
performance. The engagement of the ex-Kirov dancer looks all
too symptomatic of the new directors' inability to see where
their priorities lie. Instead of ensuring that the talented
dancers already in the company are properly nurtured, they
prefer to scour the U.S.S.R. for a possible box-office
sensation, whether the dancer in question is good or bad.
   Among those on ABT's regular roster in need of guidance is
Julio Bocca, a premier danseur of remarkable talent but with
little idea of how to put it to proper use. Playing opposite
the touching and musical Alessandra Ferri in "Giselle," he
took fire. Playing in "The Sleeping Beauty" opposite the
callow, unfocused Amanda McKerrow -- another immensely gifted
dancer badly in need of help -- he looked lost, even missing
the crucial cue, announced so thrillingly in Tchaikovsky's
music, that signals the awakening of Aurora and the
restoration of life to the entire kingdom.
   As it happens, the entire production of Petipa's greatest
work looked slack and, like so much seen during the current
season, under-rehearsed. Certainly, in this latter respect
the company is returning all too evidently to the level that
prevailed under Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith, when survival
took precedence over quality. Survival, of course, is not a
negligible consideration. On the other hand, it is hardly a
guarantee of excellence -- and excellence is surely the only
standard a ballet company ought to be aspiring to.
