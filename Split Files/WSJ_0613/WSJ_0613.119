   NEW YORK -- The bond market plodded through another dull
day with prices ending unchanged to slightly lower.
   Traders said the market's listless tenor was expected,
given the avalanche of key economic reports due to be
released today, tomorrow and Friday. Ahead of such reports,
investors are typically reluctant to establish new positions
or alter existing ones.

   That's because surprises in the reports have the potential
to roil the markets. Today, the Department of Commerce will
release the May retail sales report, followed by two
important inflation reports -- the producer price index and
the consumer price index -- on Thursday and Friday.
   "No one wants to show their hand until more of the cards
are on the table," said F. Ward McCarthy, a managing director
at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Asssociates Inc.
   But while trading has been sluggish, corporate and
municipal treasurers have continued to tap the market. That
at least gave bond investors something to talk about.
   "New issues are the only focus in the market," said
Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp. She
said considering the market has been so quiet, "I'm actually
surprised that we've been able to price and place this amount
of new corporate debt."
   Among new corporate issues, General Electric Co.'s General
Electric Capital Corp. unit offered $250 million of 18-year
notes through Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. The notes, which will be
reoffered, were priced for an initial yield of 8.67%.
   The markets were also abuzz about future new issues,
including plans by a unit of Chrysler Corp. to launch a $500
million Eurobond that will be backed by loans made to
Chrysler car dealers.
   The offering, which will be issued by Chrysler Finance
Co., is unusual in two ways. Most importantly, it's the
first-ever Eurobond backed by automobile loans.
   Secondly, while loans to auto buyers have been popular
fodder for asset-backed deals in the U.S., the Chrysler issue
will be the first that is secured with loans made by auto
makers to their dealers. These loans are used by dealers to
finance their showroom inventories until the cars can be
sold.
   The auto-loan securities market in the U.S. now totals
more than $20 billion. The first public asset-backed offering
in the U.S. was an auto-loan issue in May 1985.
   Dennis Cantwell, vice-president of Chrysler Financial's
corporate finance and development division, said the decision
to launch a deal in the Euromarket was driven by demand for
such bonds as well as the company's plans to diversify its
investor base.
   "We have been doing deals securitized on sales of
receivables in the {U.S.} public since 1986 and this is an
extension. We want to access as many markets with as many
different kinds of structures as the opportunities present
themselves, " he said.
   Looking to the economic reports, retail sales are expected
to have remained unchanged from April, according to the
average of estimates of 18 economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report. The economists' forecasts ranged
widely -- from two calls for a 0.6% decline to one call for
0.5% gain.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Funding slipped on news
that the casino's gross revenues totaled $36.5 million during
its first month of operation.
   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission said the Trump
Taj's May revenues represented the largest ever reported for
a single month in New Jersey history.
   But some high-yield analysts weren't impressed because
they say the revenues were still somewhat lower than
necessary. "We are talking about May when the novelty is
still here," said one high-yield analyst. "What's it going to
be like in January or February?"
   Trump Taj Mahal's 14% bonds due in 1998 slid two points to
end at 57 on the American Stock Exchange. However, there was
little trading in the bonds.
   The 12 7/8% bonds of Trump Plaza, which reported the
second-largest gross at $31.32 million, compared with $25.31
million a year ago, ended up 1/2 point at 84 1/2.
   In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, finished about 1/4 point lower.
   Junk bond traders said the high-yield market was catching
its breath after the recent run-up in prices.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury, Agency Securities

   Most Treasury securities ended unchanged to as much as 1/8
point lower, a loss of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 4/32 to
yield 8.45% compared with 103 7/32 to yield 8.44% on Monday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 102 17/32 to
yield 8.47% compared with 102 20/32 to yield 8.46%. Most
shorter-term securities, including Treasury bills, were
little changed.
   In the agency market, traders said there were no surprises
in the pricing of $1.34 billion of Federal Home Loan Banks
bonds. The agency priced $365 million of one-year bonds to
yield 8.25%; $570 million two-year bonds to yield 8.45%; and
the $400 million four-year securities to yield 8.625%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Moving as expected within extremely narrow bands, the
tax-exempt market ended basically unchanged, with some issues
up 1/8 point in spots.
   In addition to awaiting oncoming supply expected to hit
the market this week, participants have been sitting on the
sidelines ahead of the release of economic data to provide
directional barometers for the market, traders said.
   In competitive action, $190 million of Los Angeles
wastewater system revenue bonds were won by a
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group with a bid setting the
true interest cost at 7.215%. True interest is a measure of
the interest costs paid by the issuer when the underwriting
expenses are factored in.
   The bonds, rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service
Inc. and single-A by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., are priced to
yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.25% in 2020.
   A Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group is expected to price
$100 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
consolidated revenue bonds today.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged at 98 1/2 to yield
7.32%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Prices of British government bonds, called gilts, climbed
yesterday on speculation that the nation's currency will
enter the European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism
sooner than expected.
   The speculation was triggered by a story in yesterday's
Financial Times, which is published in London. The story
suggested that sterling could enter the ERM as soon as
September.
   The article also stated that British authorities would
like to join the ERM with a wide 6% trading band, as did
Spain when it entered last year. The trading band is a limit
on how far one currency can trade away from its assigned
level without prompting a change in monetary policy. Most
currencies in ERM trade within a 2.25% band.
   Setting the wider band would allow Britian to join ERM
sooner because it wouldn't require Britain to make as much
progress in containing inflation ahead of entry. That's
because sterling would have more room to fluctuate within its
assigned range.
   Sterling's entry into ERM could be bullish for the gilts
market because investors assume that the action would lead to
lower inflation and a more stable pound and eventually -- as
more money flows into the gilts market -- lower interest
rates.
   In trading yesterday, the benchmark 11.75% gilt due in
2003/2007 ended 7/8 point higher at 101 3/32 to yield 11.59%.
The bond had been as much as 1 1/4 points higher during the
morning.
   West German government bonds ended mixed in thin,
directionless trading. Bonn's 8.75% bonds due 2000 closed
unchanged at 99.38 to yield 8.84%. But the 8.5% notes due
1995 were off 0.04 point at 97.99 to yield 9.02%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities ended little changed after
light trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for June delivery finished at 99 5/32, down 1/32; 10%
securities ended at 101 18/32, up 1/32, and Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities ended at 98 15/32, down 1/32.
