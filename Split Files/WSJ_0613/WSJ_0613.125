   SAN DIEGO -- Magma Power Co. said it expects
second-quarter earnings to be adversely affected by damage to
a transmission line during a storm last weekend in
California's Imperial Valley.
   Magma officials declined to estimate the impact on
earnings. In last year's second quarter, Magma had net income
of $4 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $14.1
million.

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Magma
shares closed at $30.50, down $2.25.
   The storm, the remnant of Hurricane Boris, toppled several
towers of a transmission line owned and operated by the
Imperial Irrigation District. The 400-megawatt line,
completed in 1988, was built with money provided by a
consortium of independent power producers, including Magma.
It transmits electrical power to SCEcorp's Southern
California Edison Co. Mirage Substation in Riverside County.
Magma said damage to the line is covered by insurance.
   Magma said the damage has caused its four geothermal
plants in the Imperial Valley to curtail electrical
generation, and that the outage could have an adverse impact
on the second-quarter results of the four partnerships that
own the affected plants. Magma and Mission Energy Co., a unit
of Rosemead, Calif.-based SCEcorp, each own 50% of those
partnerships. A temporary bypass of the damaged section and
alternate transmission paths are being considered, but a
bypass could take two weeks to one month to complete, Magma
said.
   Magma said the four geothermal plants, operated by its Red
Hill Geothermal subsidiary, weren't damaged by the storm.
