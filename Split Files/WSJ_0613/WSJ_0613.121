   National Westminster Bank PLC, London, is cutting its
Third World debt-management staff sharply next month, a move
signaling that Britain's second-largest commercial bank has
substantially trimmed its exposure to troubled sovereign
loans.
   NatWest's staff of 36 professionals within its Sovereign
Risk Unit will be cut in early July to a custodial operation
of fewer than 10 employees, possibly with just two
professional staffers assigned to oversee day-to-day
management of the bank's debt positions.

   A NatWest spokesman declined to confirm the figures,
although he said, "The staffing levels would move in line
with our aggressive asset-management policy."
   NatWest, which had #1.8 billion ($3.04 billion) of
exposure to 24 lesser developed countries at the end of 1989,
trimmed #723 million from its portfolio last year through
sales into the secondary-debt market. It also exited from
exposure to five countries outright as a result of those
sales.
