   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which
unveiled its credit card only 79 days ago, said it has signed
up one million accounts for the card so far and plans to be
among the nation's five largest issuers by the end of 1991.
   The million-account mark, which translates into 1.7
million card holders, is more than three times as many
accounts as experts had predicted up to this point for the
AT&amp;T Universal card, which comes as either a Visa or
MasterCard and also serves as a calling card.

   The success of AT&amp;T's card hasn't gone unnoticed by four
of the nation's largest bank-card issuers, which have filed
complaints with federal and state authorities, challenging
the card's legality.
   "We are more than double where we expected to be by this
time in terms of accounts," said Paul Kahn, president of AT&amp;T
Universal Card Services Corp. "And revenue in the first month
was more than four times ahead."
   In fact, he said, card holders have made more than $100
million in purchases, and those revenues don't include
long-distance call charges.
   Analysts have pegged the card's success so far to a free
lifetime membership to any card holder who signs up this
year. AT&amp;T is also offering a 10% discount on all
long-distance calls made with the card.
   Employees have also put in long hours, said Mr. Kahn. "Our
people have been working six and seven-day weeks, more than I
would have liked, to book this business."
   AT&amp;T joined forces in March with Synovus Financial Corp.,
a Columbus, Ga., bank holding company, to distribute the AT&amp;T
Universal Card and process card accounts through Synovus's
Total Systems Services Inc. Another Synovus subsidiary,
Universal Bank, issues the cards and handles billing on card
transactions. AT&amp;T owns a small stake in Universal and buys
its credit-card receivables.
   Last month, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp., BankAmerica
Corp. and MNC Financial Corp. asked the Federal Reserve
Board, the Federal Communications Commission and the Georgia
State Banking Department to examine whether AT&amp;T's venture
violates banking and communications law.
   The banks have charged that Universal Bank is controlled
by AT&amp;T and that the communications giant is therefore
violating federal banking laws that forbid commercial and
industrial companies from owning commercial banks. The banks
also claim that Universal is really a funding vehicle for an
unregulated affiliate, AT&amp;T. They also allege that the bank
is grossly undercapitalized, given its $3 million in capital
and ambitions to reach millions of customers.
   What's more, the banks have complained to the FCC that the
10% discount on calls amounts to "predatory pricing" against
other communications providers and is a price cut the FCC
hasn't authorized under its normal tariff system.
