   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills will
reaffirm later this week that India's policies governing
insurance and investment are unreasonable and hurt U.S.
commercial interests, but she won't order trade retaliation,
administration officials said.
   Instead, Mrs. Hills will say that the U.S. will seek to
address its concerns about the Indian trade barriers in the
so-called Uruguay Round of current multilateral trade
liberalization talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, the same officials said.

   The U.S. will reserve the right to take unilateral action
against India's trade barriers if they aren't addressed in
the GATT talks, which are expected to conclude in December.
India is an important participant in the talks because it has
substantial influence over other developing countries.
   Mrs. Hills is required to reach a determination about
India's insurance and investment practices under the
so-called Super 301 clause of the 1988 Trade Act. That law
was intended to help the U.S. open foreign markets through
negotiation backed by the threat of trade retaliation. India
was cited in April 1989, along with Japan and Brazil. But
while Japan and Brazil settled their differences with the
U.S., India has refused to negotiate.
   Several U.S. insurance companies are eager to invest more
in India, particularly to have access to that country's
growing middle-class market. But they say India's prohibitive
investment regulations prevent that. The U.S. had an $851
million merchandise trade deficit with India in 1989.
