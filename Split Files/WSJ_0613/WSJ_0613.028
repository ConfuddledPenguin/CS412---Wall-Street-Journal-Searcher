   WASHINGTON -- Strong exports of goods and services brought
the U.S. trade deficit in the first quarter to its lowest
level in six years, according to new Commerce Department
figures.
   The current-account trade deficit, also called the balance
of payments, was $22.9 billion in the first quarter, down
from a revised $26.7 billion in the fourth quarter of last
year. Analysts say strong growth overseas is boosting
exports, while slow growth in the U.S. is damping imports.

   "It's a great improvement, much more than we expected,"
said Lawrence Krohn, a senior economist at Shearson Lehman.
"The trade picture this year is going to be a bright one."
   The current account is the broadest measure of U.S. trade,
including goods, services and earnings on investments. In the
first quarter, the U.S. had a deficit in merchandise trade of
$26.4 billion. But that was partly offset by a surplus in
services of $6.3 billion, which was boosted by travel in the
U.S. by Japanese and other foreigners.
   The balance on investment income in the first quarter
showed a slim surplus of $600 million. That means U.S.
companies are still earning slightly more from their
investments overseas than foreign companies are earning in
the U.S. But the rush of foreign investment into the U.S. in
recent years leads many economists to believe that number
will turn negative in the future.
   The U.S. also transferred a net $3.5 billion overseas in
grants and other unilateral payments.
   The relatively good news in the first quarter suggests the
current-account deficit for the year will be under $100
billion for the first time since the early 1980s. But Nigel
Gault, senior economist for Data Resources Inc., Lexington,
Mass., says he doesn't expect much further improvement in the
near future. "I would expect us to average just under $100
billion for the next three years," he said.
   Merchandise exports increased to $96 billion in the first
quarter, a big rise from $91.7 billion in the fourth. Imports
also increased, but by a much smaller ammount, to $122.4
billion from $120.5 billion.
   Receipts from the sale of services to foreigners were
$31.6 billion in the first quarter, up from $30.2 billion in
the fourth. Payments to foreigners for services also rose, to
$25.3 billion from $24.1 billion.
   The income earned by U.S. investments abroad was $31.1
billion in the first quarter, down from $32.6 billion in the
fourth. But U.S. payments to foreign investors also fell, to
$30.4 billion from $32.1 billion in the previous quarter.
   The current-account deficit for all of 1989 was $110.03
billion.
