   The winning entry came from Kathy Cole, a secretary at a
television-repair firm in Philadelphia. As she tells it, she
was leaving the office late one afternoon when her boss
called her aside. He gave her the telephone number for his
pager with instructions to call if she should see any
attractive women at the bar where she said she was going for
a drink.
   "He said, `You know my type. Beep me,'" Ms. Cole says. And
her boss was very specific about his type: "Dark-haired,
petite, with an olive complexion, very pretty," Ms. Cole
says. "He said he didn't want to waste any time there if
there wasn't anybody to meet."

   As it turned out, Ms. Cole met someone herself and
abandoned the search. But Bruce Prager, her boss and owner of
Budrich Service Co., says he didn't think it inappropriate to
ask an employee to troll for potential dates. He says he
likes to maintain a casual, friendly atmosphere in the
workplace. "I don't feel like I did anything wrong," he says.
"For the relationship I have with my employees, I should be
praised."
   Not in the eyes of 9to5, the National Association of
Working Women -- or Ms. Cole. She entered an account of the
incident in the group's recent National Boss Contest. Mr.
Prager took top honors in a category for bosses considered so
difficult they are "Downright Unbelievable."
   Mr. Prager had stiff competition. Some 400 entries were
submitted to 9to5, an advocacy group for clerical workers
based in Cleveland. Bad-boss nominations accounted for more
than 300. "Some of these people appeared so sick that you
just had to shake your head," says Rep. Patricia Schroeder of
Colorado, one of the contest's judges.
   There was the accounting-firm supervisor who sprayed his
desk with disinfectant whenever a subordinate touched it and
followed workers to the restrooms to time their visits. And
then there was the research scientist who flew into a rage if
his secretary poured coffee above the level of the yellow
flower painted on the side of his cup.
   A hospital office worker complained that her boss refused
to talk to her except through messages sent via personal
computer. Then there was the boss who rebuked a clerk during
her annual performance evaluation for not sitting "in a
posture that would complement her as my supervisor,"
according to the clerk's entry. (That boss merited an
honorable mention.)
   Bosses' insensitivity to family needs topped the list of
complaints. One worker nominated her boss after he balked at
giving her an afternoon off to visit her mother, who had been
hospitalized for a heart attack. "Well, go ahead," the boss
grudgingly said. "But next time you should plan these things
better."
   Many workers also grumbled about having to perform
dangerous or demeaning tasks, or tasks that weren't in their
job descriptions. Mary Neisius, a former art-store clerk,
nominated her former boss after she and several other clerks
were given shovels and asked to fill potholes in the store's
badly rutted parking lot. A seven-ton pile of gravel awaited
them, she says.
   "We all needed Ben Gay the next morning," says Ms.
Neisius, who says she quit in February.
   Vivian Novis, owner of Novis Frame and Art Store in
Colorado Springs, Colo., confirms the incident, but she says
she had asked for volunteers for pothole duty. She says no
one was forced to shovel, no one was injured and no one
complained at the time.
   Many of the entrants demanded that their accounts be kept
confidential for fear they would be fired by an angry boss.
The organization released the names of only those workers who
wished to be interviewed for this article. Marilyn Lynch, a
postal worker from St. Helena, S.C., doesn't mind airing her
case. She is engaged in open warfare with her supervisor
Willard Nash. "He has told me to quit or die," Ms. Lynch
says.
   Ms. Lynch faults Mr. Nash for failing to give her a
promotion she feels she deserved. But she has other
complaints, among them soggy toilet paper. She says Mr. Nash
refused to order new paper for the post-office rest room
after an overflowing toilet had soaked the roll. Three of her
co-workers confirm her complaints.
   Mr. Nash refused to discuss the situation and referred a
reporter's telephone call to a U.S. Postal Service lawyer,
Thomas Pigford. Mr. Pigford says Mr. Nash disputes her
charges. He also adds that Ms. Lynch is regarded by the
Postal Service as a chronic complainer.
   A number of the entries suggest that sexism is alive and
well in the workplace. Becky Bradshaw Bartlett recently filed
a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
against her employer, New York Life Insurance Co. She works
at a branch office in Boulder, Colo.
   Among the incidents that prompted her to file the charge,
she says, was one involving a manager who yelled at her for
failing to serve coffee during a staff meeting, though she
had advised him the office had run out of coffee. "He said,
`I'm telling you right now, when we ask for coffee, you bring
the {expletive deleted} coffee. You squaw, me chief,'" Ms.
Bartlett says.
   The incident is also detailed in her complaint to the
federal agency. A New York Life spokesman declined to comment
on the matter while the complaint is pending.
   Not surprisingly, former bosses were featured prominently
in the nominations. But some workers confessed they are still
toiling for the taskmaster, despite the abuses, including Ms.
Cole, who was asked to size up the bar scene for her boss.
Why don't these workers quit? Age, economic circumstances and
fear they won't find another job leave many trapped, says
Ellen Bravo, associate director of 9to5.
   Some 100 workers did write to 9to5 to praise their bosses.
One "Good Boss": Peter Sander, chairman of the Drama and
Dance Department at Hofstra University. While some managers
might look askance, he won the unflagging loyalty of his
secretary, Ann Noonan, for supporting her and other clerical
workers when they struck the university last fall, demanding
pay raises. Mr. Sander even took Ms. Noonan's mail out to her
while she walked the picket line. "He treats me with
respect," Ms. Noonan says.
