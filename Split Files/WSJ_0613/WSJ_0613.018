   HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's April trade surplus with the U.S.
widened 16% to 7.17 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$921.3
million) from HK$6.17 billion (US$793.2 million) a year
earlier and was 43% wider than March's surplus of HK$5.01
billion.
   Total exports to the U.S. grew 9% to HK$11.18 billion in
April from HK$10.26 billion a year earlier and 6% from
HK$10.53 billion a month earlier.

   Imports from the U.S. in April fell 2% to HK$4.01 billion
from HK$4.09 billion the previous year and 27% from HK$5.52
billion in March. The U.S. is Hong Kong's largest export
market and is second to China in re-exports purchased from
the British colony. Re-exports are goods that are imported
and then shipped abroad again without material change.
