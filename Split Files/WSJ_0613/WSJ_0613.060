   A notebook-sized laptop computer with a removable hard
disk drive, the first of its kind, has been introduced by
GRiD Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Fort Worth, Texas-based
Tandy Corp.
   The new computer, the GRiD 1810, has a 20-megabyte disk
drive that can be removed and plugged into another GRiD 1810
or into a personal computer equipped with a special receiver.
The receiver has been developed by Tandy and currently fits
only Tandy and GRiD PCs, but a GRiD spokesman said it
eventually will be adapted for use in any standard MS-DOS
computer.

   Most data transfer between desktop PCs and portables is
now accomplished by copying files onto a floppy disk, which
has limited storage capacity. The GRiD 1810, said company
president Alan Lefkof, not only eliminates that step but
allows the portability of 25 times as much information.
   The new notebook computer weighs 6.7 pounds, is 1.8 inches
high and measures 10.4 inches by 12 inches. The standard
configuration is priced at $2,895 and includes 1 megabyte of
random access memory, an 81-key standard typewriter size
keyboard and either a backlit or reflective screen. A
removable battery lasts more than two hours with normal use.
   The company will start shipping the laptop in July, but
the desktop receiver won't be available until the fall.
