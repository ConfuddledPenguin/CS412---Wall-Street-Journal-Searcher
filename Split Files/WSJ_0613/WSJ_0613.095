   CHICAGO -- A former Chicago Mercantile Exchange member
testified in federal court that orders from the trading firm
of exchange head Leo Melamed were given special handling in
the Merc's Swiss franc futures trading pit, which at times
forced local traders to illegally take losses on trades.
   Former Merc member William Walsh testified at the trial
here of three Merc Swiss franc futures traders charged with
fraud. He said that when he executed Swiss franc futures
orders from Mr. Melamed's firm, Dellsher Investment Co., on
an equal footing with trades from other member firms, Mr.
Melamed's son, Jordan Melamed, would call and complain to
members of Mr. Walsh's broker group.

   Futures exchanges, which regulate their markets, are also
controlled by executives and board members who often trade
actively in their exchanges' trading pits. In light of the
federal investigation of futures trading fraud that surfaced
here last year, futures-exchange critics say the exchanges
leave themselves open to conflict-of-interest charges when
executives profit from trades made in the markets they
regulate.
   No officials from the Merc or the Chicago Board of Trade
have been implicated in the federal probe, which last year
resulted in 48 individuals being indicted on fraud charges,
including the Swiss franc futures traders on trial: Robert
Mosky, Danny Scheck and David Zatz.
   Mr. Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee,
said through an exchange spokesman that the allegations were
"complete and utter nonsense." Jordan Melamed couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Mr. Walsh, who pleaded guilty to reduced charges and is
cooperating with the government, said illegal trades were
made by himself and many other traders in the Merc's Swiss
franc futures pit on a regular basis. But he was unable in
several hours of testimony to cite a single, specific
instance where any of the three defendants made an illegal
trade.
   Mr. Walsh said that Mr. Mosky, a Swiss franc futures
broker, tended to "work the orders a little harder" when they
came into the pit from Dellsher, Mr. Melamed's firm. Mr.
Mosky would "squeeze" or "hold back orders" from Dellsher to
try and get the best price, even if a price change in the
market should have triggered the immediate execution of the
order, Mr. Walsh said.
   But if the market price changed so that Mr. Mosky couldn't
execute the order at the price specified by Dellsher, he
would pressure a local trader in the pit to make the trade
with him at the price Dellsher wanted, allegedly in violation
of commodity trading laws, Mr. Walsh testified. That left the
local with a trading loss equal to the difference between
that price and the market price for Swiss franc futures at
the time, he said.
