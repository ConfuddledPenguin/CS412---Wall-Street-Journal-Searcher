   Over-the-counter stocks surged strongly in the afternoon,
defying some morning selling pressure and the specter of late
week economic data and options expirations.
   "The profit-taking is over. The buyers are coming back
into the market," says David Memmott, a senior trader at
Dillon Read &amp; Co.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index pushed ahead 3.77 to 466.56.
The OTC broad index gain couldn't quite keep pace with the
rapid rise of the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index,
which added 1.13%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up
40.85, or 1.41%.
   Traders said investors with money on the sidelines entered
yesterday skeptically after Monday's thin advance.
   But the market's ability to resist sellers in the morning
persuaded investors to join the market in the afternoon, says
Robert O'Toole, head of OTC trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton. Mr. O'Toole said new money from the sidelines led
most of the afternoon rally.
   Friday will be triple witching for options and futures
expirations. Retail sales, the consumer price index and the
producer price index also are due to be released this week.
   Mr. O'Toole says uncertainty about what effect those
events might have could inspire caution when trading resumes
today. Pointing out, however, that the market managed its
gains yesterday with some investors already cautious. He
predicts "more of the same" for today, though perhaps
"without the same gusto."
   Advancers led decliners, 1,134 to 783. Volume was 163.3
million, up from 112.2 million.
   Sun Microsystems rode the vanguard of technology issues
which mostly paced yesterday's rally. The day's most-active
issue, Sun Microsystems added 1 3/8 to 33 on 2.5 million
shares.
   Dillon Read &amp; Co.'s Mr. Memmott says although yesterday's
advance was broad, technology stocks were conspicuous again
for their leadership.
   Technology issues got a boost in the form of positive
economic data. The semiconductor industry's book-to-bill
ratio rose to 1.14 in May from 1.09 in April suggesting
better sales to come.
   Intel was 3/8 higher to 47 7/8. Apple Computer climbed 1
1/2 to 40 1/2. Microsoft added 1 to 75 7/8. Oracle Systems
was up 1/8 to 21 1/4.
   Integrated Device Technology shares closed at 6 1/8, up
3/8.
   Novell hit a new 52-week high, jumping 2 1/4 to 53 1/4.
The company attributed the surge to a new line of network
management products.
   Lotus Development also announced a new product and also
closed higher. On the heels of a new 1-2-3 version for
computers using the Unix system V operating system, Lotus
shares were 3/4 higher at 38.
   Tokos Medical shares posted a solid 40% gain on the day
after announcing the acquisition of Physiologic Diagnostic
Service for 2.7 million Tokos shares.
   Tokos Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Mione said a Food &amp;
Drug Administration advisory panel has recommended
Physiologic Diagnostic Service's uterine activity monitor for
use in the detection of preterm labor. Mr. Mione said Tokos
has a similar application for a similar device pending now
before the FDA. Tokos shares closed at 15, up 4 1/4, in heavy
trading.
   Healthdyne shares were hurt initially after that FDA panel
declined to recommend its uterine activity monitor.
Healthdyne recovered in the afternoon, however, ending the
day unchanged at 11 3/4.
   Good Guys managed a 2 3/4 point, or 13%, rise to 24 1/2.
Traders and analysts couldn't explain the interest in the
consumer electronics retailer.
   Vivigen lost 1 1/8 to 15 1/2 when it revealed that its
previous second quarter estimates had been too optimistic.
   Magma Power dropped 2 1/4 to 30 1/2. Magma Power said
storm damage to a power line will hurt its second quarter
results.
