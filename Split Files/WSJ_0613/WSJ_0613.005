   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. provided new
details of how it proposes to finance its pending $1.2
billion acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co.
   In an advertisement in some of yesterday's editions of
this newspaper, Pathe disclosed the names of several banks
and European companies that would be advancing money to
Comfinance S.A., a Luxembourg-based affiliate of Pathe
principal Giancarlo Parretti. Comfinance has agreed to
provide about $368 million toward the purchase price and Time
Warner Inc. has agreed to lend another $650 million. Pathe
has already deposited $200 million in cash toward the
acquisition.

   Pathe said Banque Arabe et Internationale D'Investissement
would provide a $75 million one-week line of credit to
Comfinance and another $10 million credit line to a Pathe
affiliate. The Paris-based bank was created in 1973 with 50%
of its shares held by Arab banks and 50% held by non-Arab
financial institutions. It was one of several banks founded
during the 1970s to act as a conduit for the recycling of
petrodollars amassed by the Arab members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Last month, state-owned
Banque Nationale de Paris said it would take control of the
troubled bank, which had been hobbled by the steep decline in
world crude oil prices during the latter half of the 1980s
and bad loans in developing countries.
   Another $50 million would come from an advance by
Amsterdam-based PAN-ASS B.V. in connection with a proposed
sale of certain Spanish assets by Comfinance to an affiliate
of PAN-ASS. Other sources of the financing are various asset
sales and $15 million under an existing $80 million credit
line from Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland B.V., a well-known
entertainment industry lender. Another $91 million would be
advanced to a Pathe affiliate by Deepbridge B.V., Amsterdam.
Details about PAN-ASS and Deepbridge weren't available.
   Pathe also said it was in discussions with at least three
companies about acquiring an equity stake in MGM/UA after the
transaction closes, perhaps providing much-needed production
funds for the new company. They are Rank Laboratories Ltd.,
the film-processing unit of British-based Rank Organisation
PLC; RTL-Plus, a Luxembourg-based television company
39%-owned by West German media giant Bertelsmann AG, and
Cinergi Productions Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif-based film
company formed by Andrew G. Vajna, a co-founder of Carolco
Pictures Inc. who sold his stake in the company early this
year for more than $100 million.
   The $20-a-share tender offer is scheduled to expire
Friday, but could be extended to June 23.
   MGM/UA shares were unchanged yesterday at $18.875 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
