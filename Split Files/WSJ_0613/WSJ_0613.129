   BERN -- Switzerland's cost-of-living index rose 0.5% in
May from April and 5.1% from a year earlier, the Federal
Statistics Office said.
   The rise was smaller than many economists and analysts had
expected. The monthly rise had been widely forecast at 0.7%
to 0.9% and the year-to-year increase at 5.3% to 5.5%.

   A month earlier, the year-to-year increase in the index
was 4.6%. For the year ending in May 1989, it was 3.0%.
   The latest jump in the year-to-year rate was due largely
to recent rent increases, which in turn followed rises in
Swiss mortgage rates, economists said.
