   Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., and Ingres Corp.,
Alameda, Calif., said they failed to reach an agreement on a
previously announced plan for Digital to invest in the
software maker.
   The companies disclosed their discussions in May, though
they didn't give details. Digital rarely invests in other
companies, but such investments have become increasingly
common in the computer industry, as large computer hardware
makers seek technology and encourage small companies to
perform research and development related to the larger
companies' computer hardware. Digital was said to be
interested in Ingres's data base technology.

   Ingres President Paul E. Newton said the two companies
"were unable to agree on a strengthened alliance that was
consistent with our respective strategies. We both view this
as a missed opportunity." He said the two companies will
continue to work together under existing relationships.
