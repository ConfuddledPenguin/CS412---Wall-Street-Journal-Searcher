   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union continues to blow hot and cold
on the vexed question of German unity, but some clear signs
of flexibility are emerging from behind the rhetoric.
   Addressing the Soviet parliament, President Mikhail
Gorbachev gave his broadest hint so far that Moscow could
envisage certain conditions under which a united Germany
could be part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr.
Gorbachev repeated an earlier Soviet formula that Germany
could become an "associate member" of both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact as long as this was done in conjunction with an
overhaul of the two military alliances as part of the German
unification process.

   But in an apparent change from the earlier Soviet
position, Mr. Gorbachev dropped his insistence on East
Germany remaining part of the Warsaw Pact military structure.
Instead, he said that during a transition period, the West
German army would be subordinated to NATO, while the East
German army would be subject to the new government of a
united Germany -- not to the Warsaw Pact. The new German
government may well disband the East German army. However,
Soviet troops would continue to be stationed on East German
soil during the transition period, Mr. Gorbachev said.
   His comments were presented in a hypothetical way and
don't constitute any major breakthrough in solving the
problem of a future security arrangement for Germany. The
Soviet leader previously has suggested that U.S. and Soviet
troops should remain on German soil, and has frequently
called for major changes to the two military alliances.
   But Soviet officials and Western diplomats said Mr.
Gorbachev's comments are noteworthy because they signal a
strong desire by the Kremlin to work with NATO in the search
of a face-saving security arrangement for Germany. As such,
the comments represent a sharp turn from Moscow's tougher
stance just a few weeks ago, when it rejected German NATO
membership and suggested that German neutrality was the only
feasible option.
   "It's important not to read too much into the content {of
Mr. Gorbachev's remarks}," said one German diplomat. "But the
Soviets are sending a signal to the world that serves its own
function."
   In Washington, President Bush told reporters that the U.S.
hadn't changed its position that a unified Germany should be
in NATO with no conditions. In Brussels, NATO said in a
statement that it would study Gorbachev's speech carefully
but that the idea of duel or associate membership "does not
seem promising."
   The Soviet desire to reach a formula on German security
was underscored at a meeting between Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and his West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, in the Soviet town of Brest on Monday. Details of
the more than six hours of talks weren't disclosed. But Mr.
Shevardnadze told a concluding news conference that, "We see
the development of a very favorable setting for a mutually
acceptable settlement of the military-political status of a
future united Germany."
   Following the democratic revolution in East Germany last
fall, Moscow soon realized there was little it could do to
stop German unification. But, as one of the four victorious
World War II powers, it could still drag its feet and disrupt
the unification process. Many Soviet analysts say Moscow
would be unwise to do so because it would risk jeopardizing
relations with the new state from the start.
   But Mr. Gorbachev has been under strong pressure from
high-level Soviet officials, both civilian and military, over
how to handle the security issue. Many say publicly that a
united Germany as part of NATO would be a severe
foreign-policy blow, tantamount to "losing" East Germany.
   "There are numerous signs that NATO is using the new
situation on the continent to pursue its selfish aims,
creating an imbalance of forces," Oleg Baklanov, a senior
Communist Party official, told the Rabochaya Tribuna
newspaper. "Our Western partners would like to proceed from
premises that are advantageous only to them."
   The U.S. and its allies have tried to take such concerns
into account. At a recent NATO meeting in Scotland, U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker offered concessions that are
designed to make German membership of NATO more palatable to
the Soviets. But many in Moscow say that these moves don't go
far enough, and they are seeking to use the German issue as
leverage to bring about a fundamental change to the NATO
alliance.
   "We need a more solid basis {for a future security
arrangement for Germany} than NATO, which is built on
confrontation with the Soviet Union," says Valentin Falin, a
former Soviet ambassador to West Germany who now plays an
important role in formulating Moscow's German policies. He
says Mr. Baker's plans are "generally positive, but so far
they are only ideas."
   Mr. Gorbachev told parliament that, "We can't accept that
the West thinks movement should only come from our side."
   The issue is immensely complicated by the Soviet Union's
love-hate relationship with Germany. Many Soviets are looking
to Germany to provide badly needed economic assistance. There
are already strong rumors in Moscow and elsewhere that Bonn
is considering offering large government credits to the
Soviets, perhaps as the price for accepting East German
membership of NATO.
   But hardliners in the Kremlin also have a potent argument:
World War II, in which more than 20 million Soviets died.
They use the war to warn of the dangers of an enlarged
Germany and press home their arguments for tough terms
concerning a future security arrangement. "We can understand
the Germans, who have waited 45 years {for unity}," Mr. Falin
says. "But we should be aware of worries that the expansion
of Germany is linked with militarism. We must not forget the
lessons of the past."
