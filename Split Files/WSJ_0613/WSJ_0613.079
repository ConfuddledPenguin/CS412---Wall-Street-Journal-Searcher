   OLD GREENWICH, Conn. -- The rating on about $1.7 billion
of American Brands Inc.'s debt was boosted to single-A-3 from
Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   The rating concern also upgraded a shelf registration of
senior debt of the tobacco, consumer products and insurance
company to preliminary single-A-3 from preliminary Baa-3. And
Moody's confirmed its prime-2 rating on the company's
commercial paper.

   A "more-focused" American Brands "is generating increasing
free cash flow from non-tobacco businesses, while continuing
to benefit from {tobacco} volume and price gains in the
important United Kingdom and U.S. markets," Moody's said.
   Potential impediments to greater cash generation from the
company's tobacco and distilled spirits businesses include
continued declines in per-capita consumption of cigarettes,
Moody's said. A material increase in excise taxes or an
adverse tobacco product-liability judgment are major external
risk factors, Moody's added.
