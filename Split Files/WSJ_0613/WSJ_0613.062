   Medical researchers reported that a comprehensive
education program for premature, underweight babies that
begins just after birth can significantly improve the
infants' chances for productive lives.
   The finding, in a major study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, has broad implications for
physicians, educators, scientists and lawmakers, as well as
premature newborns and their families.

   Specifically, the study found that early educational aid
to help develop language and motor skills, among other
things, leads to higher IQs and fewer behavioral problems by
age three for babies born early and weighing under 5.5
pounds. "We now have convincing evidence that early
intervention for high-risk children can make an important
difference," says Ruby Hearn, vice president at Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, the principal sponsor of the $33 million
project. "People have been looking for scientific evidence"
that such an approach is effective, she said.
   More than 250,000 babies are born prematurely each year in
the U.S.; particularly vulnerable are those born to mothers
in the inner city and some rural areas, where nutrition and
prenatal care are often inadequate. After piling up huge
medical bills in infancy, such children often place enormous
demands for special education and other services on
communities. Thus, effective measures to mitigate the effects
of premature birth might save money as well as improve lives.
   "The issue of low birth-weight really presents two
challenges," says Woodie Kessel, division director in
maternal and child health bureau of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. "The primary challenge is to
prevent it. This study addresses another aspect: Given
infants born at risk, what can we do to avoid the
consequences? (The study) demonstrates a very robust effect
in terms of improving the functioning of these kids."
   But it also underscores the potential problems ahead for
such babies: Nearly half of the children in the study who
received only routine medical care had by age three IQ scores
under 85, a level associated with significant learning
problems.
   While scientific evidence linking low birthweight to
long-term problems is sketchy, learning problems do lead to
poor school performance, which predicts other problems in
life, Ms. Hearn says, adding, "It's a scenario that people do
spin out."
   Congress recently revised special education laws and now
requires communities to provide special services to
handicapped children age three and older, and it has
encouraged states to begin such programs at birth for
children who are likely to face learning and behavioral
problems by the time they reach school age.
   "It is clear that society is now beginning to understand
the importance of investing in children," Ms. Hearn says.
"Our study's findings are timely and demonstrate the benefit
of these early intervention services."
   Researchers said the study established that such services
can be provided successfully even in inner cities, where they
are desperately needed, but where disrupted family lives and
other circumstances often make them difficult to render.
While costs of such services haven't been determined yet, the
researchers estimated that the program could be provided for
about $10,000 a year per child. In most cases, public funds
would probably be necessary.
   The study's conclusions are based on a scientifically
designed study of 985 premature infants from birth to age
three at eight U.S. cities. The focus wasn't on the month the
baby was born, but rather on birth weight. One-third of the
babies at each site weighed between 4.4 and 5.5 pounds at
birth. The others weighed under 4.4 pounds. Mothers came from
a broad range of educational, ethnic and economic
backgrounds.
   All of the infants had regular follow-up visits to
pediatricians, but half at each site also participated in an
intensive program of services that started when they were
discharged from the hospital and ended at their third
birthdays.
   For the heavier group of infants, the additional services
resulted in average IQs that were 13.2 points higher than
those of children who had only the follow-up pediatric
visits. For the infants under 4.4 pounds, IQs averaged 6.6
points higher for those with the special services. Moreover,
children who had only the routine follow-up were 2.7 times
more likely to have IQ scores lower than 70, considered the
level of mental retardation.
   "The most significant finding is the tremendous
improvement in cognitive development that those children
experienced," says Ruth T. Gross, director of the Infant
Health and Development Program, which conducted the study
from Stanford University in California.
   In addition, mothers of children with the additional
services reported seeing fewer behavioral problems, including
extreme shyness or over-aggressiveness, than those who had
only the routine visits.
   As part of the services, specially trained teachers
visited homes of the babies weekly during the first year,
teaching parents about growth of their children and how to
assist in their development. "Sometimes, parents treat the
children as if they are more fragile than they actually are,"
Ms. Hearn says, "and don't provide the stimulation they need
to catch up."
   After age one, the children attended daily classes at
child development centers in day-care-like settings. Since
low birthweight children are especially vulnerable to
illness, researchers were concerned that the group sessions
could lead to spread of infection. Special measures were
taken, particularly among staff. "We took every precaution
and had no problems," Dr. Gross said.
   In the child development centers, there was one teacher
for every three children aged 12 to 23 months and one for
every four aged 24 to 36 months. Classes focused on language
and motor skills. "It has to be a high quality child
development center, with a very careful emphasis on health
and safety," Dr. Gross says. "You can't just throw them into
any day-care center and expect all would be well."
   Those receiving special services, especially the
lighter-weight group of infants, did have slightly more minor
health problems than those in the follow-up group,
researchers said. But because they had feared serious health
problems, that finding was considered reassuring.
   Researchers were especially encouraged that 93% of the
subjects of the study participated for the full three years
of the study -- a high retention rate for almost any clinical
trial. Such a high rate, as well as the number of sites,
helped ensure the statistical validity of the results,
researchers said.
   Researchers hope to monitor the progress of the children
involved in the study as they reach school age to determine
whether the special attention at an early age helps boost
academic performance.
