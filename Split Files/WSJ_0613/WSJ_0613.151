   MONTREAL -- Royal Bank of Canada said it agreed to acquire
International Trust Co., even though Canadian legislation
doesn't permit banks to buy trust concerns, which are similar
to U.S. thrifts.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed. International Trust
is wholly owned by closely held International Trustco Inc.,
based in Toronto. It has about 80 employees, and at the end
of 1989 it was administering on behalf of clients assets of
about 3 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.56 billion).

   Jim MacKay, a Royal Bank vice president, said the purchase
would be completed as soon as proposed changes to Canada's
Bank Act permit such a transaction. But the new rules
probably won't be introduced in the federal legislature until
this fall, he said. In the meantime, Royal Bank will be able
to refer its customers seeking trust services to
International Trust. Trust services include custodial fees
for pension funds, trustee, administration and record-keeping
services for group savings plans, securities lending and
pooled investment funds.
   Canada's banks have been awaiting further deregulation of
the financial-services sector since they were permitted in
1987 to own securities dealers. One of their goals is to
expand into businesses that generate fee income, such as the
trust business and insurance. Although current regulations
prohibit banks from owning insurance companies, several of
them have established links with insurance companies by
referring their bank clients to them.
   Mr. MacKay said that by agreeing to buy International
Trust as soon as permitted by law, rather than building the
business from the ground up, Royal Bank will save three years
in the development of its trust operations.
