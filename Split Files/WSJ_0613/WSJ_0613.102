   In the general rejoicing over the historic blow that the
big tuna canners recently struck in defense of dolphins,
nobody seems to be paying much attention to the unhappy lot
of another group of our fellow creatures. Who, as Dr. Seuss
might put it, speaks for the fish? How is it that the same
folks who struggled so valiantly to make the seas safe for
dolphins and whales can dig into a tuna salad platter or a
dish of herring in sour cream without blinking an eye?
   Chances are that your instinctive response to those
questions will be that tuna and herrings, after all, aren't
endangered species. True enough, but neither are dolphins nor
most kinds of whales. If preserving species from extinction
were actually the central issue, there would be no need for a
ban on all commercial whaling nor for imposing on U.S. tuna
fishermen restrictions that could drive them to abandon their
traditional fishing grounds to foreign fleets that kill even
more tuna.

   But if pure environmentalism isn't the spur, what does
explain the protective urge that dolphins and whales arouse
in so many of us and that tuna and flounder so conspicuously
fail to stir? The answer, I believe, is inescapable. Fish are
scaly, cold-blooded creatures with no communications skills
and nerdlike personalities. Dolphins and whales, on the other
hand, are whimsical, warm-blooded extroverts who, just like
us humans, can sing, whistle and solve simple quadratic
equations. (Well, just like some of us humans anyway;
personally, I can't sing for sour apples and have never
knowingly solved a quadratic equation in my life.)
   What we're talking about here, in other words, is
mammalian chauvinist piggery. And like all other forms of
chauvinist piggery, this one rests on some pretty flimsy
foundations. Isn't it sheer cultural arrogance to assume that
fish are fit only for bouillabaisse simply because they
aren't as good at humanoid activities as dolphins? We try to
eliminate culture-specific and gender-specific questions from
policemen's and firefighters' exams these days, don't we? So
where do we get off setting up species-specific
qualifications for immunity from being broiled, baked or
sauteed?
   Similarly, to argue that fish rate less consideration than
dolphins or whales because they are less intelligent is
surely nothing but elitism. And in this day and age the evils
of elitism hardly need belaboring. Start down that slippery
slope and the next thing you know they'll be re-introducing
tracking into your local high school.
   I'm under no illusion about the magnitude of the problem
I'm attacking. There are millions of folks out there so
unimaginative and indifferent to basic philosophical concerns
that it would take sustained public-relations wizardry of the
highest order to sensitize them to the plight of Charlie the
Tuna. But, hey, that's one field where we Americans are still
acknowledged to be world leaders, and I'm going to try to
pick up some tips from our local Greenpeace person as soon as
possible. Maybe over lunch at this little place I know where
they have the most terrific fish chowder.
