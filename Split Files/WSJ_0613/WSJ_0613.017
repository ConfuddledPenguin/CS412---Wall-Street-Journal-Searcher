   TOKYO -- Japanese machinery makers received orders valued
at 1.871 trillion yen ($12.1 million) in April, up 16.2% from
a year earlier, supported by strong domestic and overseas
demand, the Economic Planning Agency said.
   On a seasonally adjusted basis, April's machinery orders
rose 18% from March to 2.069 trillion yen. An agency official
said orders remained in an upward trend during April, and
will apparently stay that way for the foreseeable future.
