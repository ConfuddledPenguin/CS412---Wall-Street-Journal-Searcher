   NEW YORK -- The noise around Masco Corp. these days isn't
just the grinding, hammering and sawing that goes with the
making of faucets, furniture and cabinets.
   It is also the unwelcome thud of analysts dropping their
earnings estimates.

   Citing weakness in the housing industry, at least four
major Wall Street securities firms have lowered their 1990
earnings estimates or investment opinions on Masco in recent
days. The estimates currently range from $1.83 a share to $2
a share.
   Both ends of that range are below the target of $2.04 a
share that Masco's management set in a meeting with analysts
Feb. 28. Masco makes building and home-improvement products,
home furnishings and other specialty consumer products.
   The outlook is such that Masco's management now is backing
away from its prediction that 1990 per-share earnings would
set a new record, exceeding the $2.03 the company posted for
1988. In 1989, earnings fell for the first time in 32 years
to $1.42 a share.
   John C. Nicholls Jr., Masco treasurer, said in an
interview yesterday: "Unless our markets reflect a
significant improvement, I would agree that we won't make the
record." He added that second-quarter earnings will decline
from the year earlier's 50 cents a share.
   "April was indeed a very poor month," said Mr. Nicholls,
who said he plans to review May's results on Friday.
   Mr. Nicholls also said the projection of record earnings,
made by Masco Chairman Richard A. Manoogian, came with a
caveat that the record could be achieved if "macroeconomics
did not worsen." Adds Mr. Nicholls: "Things have materially
changed since February."
   Housing analysts would agree. Barbara Allen, a Kidder
Peabody analyst who yesterday lowered her 1990 earnings
estimate for Masco to $1.90 a share from $2.15, said the
action resulted from her lower estimate for national housing
starts. Ms. Allen is now projecting 1,225,000 housing starts
this year, down from her earlier projection of 1,375,000,
which would have been a slight increase from last year's
level of 1,370,000.
   Ms. Allen expects a continuing slowdown in Masco's sales
to builders, which she says represent about 35% of the
company's revenue. "I think in the second half of the year
there will be very limited amounts of new construction
starting," she says, adding: "You can't build houses without
construction funds, and construction funds are very difficult
to come by now."
   Even after reducing her estimate, however, Ms. Allen
remains positive on Masco's long-term outlook. And analysts
who follow Masco for other Wall Street firms -- including
Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman Brothers, and
Smith Barney -- believe that Masco will outperform other
stocks over the long term, as the company digests its recent
furniture acquisitions and as housing recovers.
   But Masco also is beginning to attract the attention of
aggressive short sellers, who are betting that Masco made an
expensive mistake when it spent about $1.7 billion to buy
four furniture companies from 1986 through 1989. The short
sellers are selling borrowed shares in the hopes of replacing
them with shares bought later at a lower price. They doubt
that Masco will be able to improve the efficiency of
furniture-making the way it cranked up faucet manufacturing
and marketing.
   Masco, which invented the single-handle Delta brand
faucet, has spent 30 years transforming the lowly faucet into
a high-profit item. In 1984, it spun off 51% of its original
auto and industrial parts-making business as Masco
Industries, to focus on consumer goods. It moved quickly into
kitchen and bathroom cabinets, then tackled furniture,
initially by acquiring Henredon.
   "The assimilation process has not gone ahead as quickly as
they {Masco} had hoped," says Gregory Nejmeh of Shearson
Lehman. "As to whether or not the strategy itself is faulty,
I don't think we're going to know for another five years."
Stephen Dobi of Smith Barney is more optimistic. He expects
1991 profit margins to expand as Masco restructures
internally. "There's real value in this stock," he says. "The
risk is that the stock is dead money for six months or so."
   Masco also has a $250 million investment in a leveraged
buy-out, mostly in a temporary "bridge" loan that turned
long-term when it couldn't be repaid by selling junk bonds.
The LBO is Payless Cashways, a chain of home-improvement
material stores.
   Masco Capital, of which Masco effectively owns 75%, bought
$41 million of junior convertible preferred stock and $168
million of zero-coupon junk bonds from Payless, which, in
turn, agreed to buy more of Masco's products. Though Payless
seems to be doing well, another issue of its publicly traded
junk bonds is trading at about 75 cents on the dollar.
   Masco hasn't written down the Payless investment and
doesn't plan to. Shearson's Mr. Nejmeh says a write-off, if
needed, would cost Masco $121.9 million after taxes, or about
78 cents a share.
