   PARSIPPANY, N.J. -- General Public Utilities Corp. amended
its bylaws to exclude two provisions of Pennsylvania's
controversial new anti-takeover statute.
   Widely regarded as the U.S.'s toughest anti-takeover
statute, the law was enacted in April and gave corporations
that are incorporated in Pennsylvania 90 days from the time
of its enactment to opt out of certain provisions. GPU is
incorporated in Pennsylvania, with headquarters here.

   GPU's board chose to exclude the so-called disgorgement
provision that would force short-term holders who sell their
shares within 18 months after a failed attempt to "control" a
company to turn over the profits on the stock sales to the
target company.
   GPU also deleted the "control-shares provision" that
withholds the voting rights of holders who control 20% or
more of a company's stock until "disinterested" holders agree
to restore their votes.
   The company took no action on the statute's provision
regarding the fiduciary duty of directors. The law allows
directors to base decisions not only on shareholders'
interests, but also on the interests of employees, customers,
suppliers and other "stakeholders." The provision also
insulates directors from most lawsuits by aggrieved
stakeholders and guarantees labor contracts and severance pay
in the event of a takeover.
   Standley H. Hoch, GPU chairman, said that "it was
inappropriate to deprive shareholders of their voting rights
and profits under the circumstances provided in the
Pennsylvania statute." As for the decision to keep the
fiduciary provision in the statute, Mr. Hoch said that "a
public utility's statutory obligation to provide adequate and
safe electric service to its customers has long been held to
be consistent with the long-term interests of its
shareholders."
   Pennsylvania enacted the law at the behest of Armstrong
World Industries Inc. The Lancaster, Pa., company had been
the target of a possible bid by Canada's Belzberg family,
which also initiated a proxy fight against the company. At
Armstrong's annual meeting, only a few days after the law was
passed, the Belzbergs managed to win only one seat of the
four up for election on the 13-member board and were later
forced to sell the family's 11.7% Armstrong stake at a loss.
   At least two lawsuits challenging the law's
constitutionality have been filed since Gov. Robert P. Casey
signed the bill.
