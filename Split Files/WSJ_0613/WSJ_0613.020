   NEW YORK -- Bucking bearish Wall Street sentiment about
their company and its huge debt burden, officers and
directors at Black &amp; Decker Corp. have been buying its stock,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   So far this year, nine insiders at the Towson, Md.,
appliance and power-tool manufacturer have taken advantage of
its depressed stock price to purchase shares. That compares
with only one insider who bought the company's stock in all
of last year, SEC filings show.

   Chief among the four insiders who bought shares in April
and May: Chairman Nolan D. Archibald. His purchase in May of
20,000 shares for $265,000, or $13.25 a share, more than
tripled his existing holdings. In a telephone interview
yesterday, he predicted that time will show the shares were
"the best investment I ever made."
   Black &amp; Decker shares closed in New York Stock Exchange
trading yesterday at $15.25, up 25 cents. That's way below
the $25.25 high of 1989.
   Mr. Archibald blamed the low price on Wall Street's
"short-term orientation." The stock price fell sharply on
news of the company's acquisition of Emhart Corp. last year,
and has never fully recovered, he said. But "the Street
doesn't understand" how successful the acquisition has been
in making Black &amp; Decker "a less cyclical company, a
higher-margin company not dependent on two product lines," he
said.
   Russell Leavitt, Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst, called the
insider purchases "an encouraging sign." But he added that
"near-term, there are hurdles the company needs to overcome."
He and other analysts fret that Black &amp; Decker's plan to shed
many Emhart assets is going far more slowly than expected,
boosting interest costs. Eventually, they say, it might be
forced to sell assets at fire-sale prices.
   Jerome Fischer, analyst at Value Line Publishing Inc.,
noting that debt is running at 80% of capital, predicted that
"the stock is likely to underperform the market averages"
into 1991. But, "assuming all goes well" with efforts to
reduce debt, record earnings are possible in 1992-1994.
   "The debt is too high," said Mr. Archibald. But he said
the company has undertaken several measures to reduce it,
including a cost-cutting program, a reduction in capital
expenditures and scale-down of inventories. Only one of the
measures -- the planned shedding of some Emhart assets --
hasn't been fully successful yet, he said.
   Some of the bullish insiders have continued to buy even
though the stock price has dropped since their first
purchases. William C. Battle, director and retired chairman
of Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., purchased 2,000 shares at $14
each, on top of a purchase of 1,000 shares in February at
$16.25 a share. He couldn't be reached for comment.

   THE TELLER'S WINDOW: In the largest purchase reported to
the SEC last week, Thomas M. Garrott, president of National
Commerce Bancorp, spent $1.6 million on 78,285 shares of the
Memphis-based bank holding company. As shown on the
accompanying Insider Trading Spotlight, a series of purchases
made from May 21 through May 29 increased Mr. Garrott's
holdings in National Commerce by 34%. He now owns 307,016
shares, SEC filings show (see accompanying table -- WSJ June
12, 1990).
   The "marketplace gave me a great buying opportunity," Mr.
Garrott said. Wall Street is penalizing all bank stocks and
"has thrown out the babies with the bath water."
   National Commerce's earnings have been increasing steadily
over the past few years, he said, but the stock price doesn't
reflect it.
   Mr. Garrott's purchase followed those by two other
National Commerce insiders, a director and an officer, who
bought 3,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively, in April and
May, SEC filings show. Those purchases increased their
holdings by 12% and 10%, respectively, according to the
filings.
   All three insiders paid share prices ranging from $20.75
to $22. In over-the-counter trading, National Commerce shares
closed at $22.25, up $1.

   LAND RUSH: Two vice presidents of Tiffany &amp; Co., the New
York-based jewelry and luxury items retailer, sold the
majority of their shares in May, SEC filings show.
   Robert J. Warren, the company's treasurer and a vice
president, sold 10,000 shares on May 17 for $428,800, or
$42.88 a share. SEC filings show he retains 8,000 shares. Mr.
Warren said he sold the shares to buy real estate.
   John R. Loring, senior vice president and design director,
sold 24,500 shares, retaining 10,000, in three separate sales
on May 22, SEC filings show. The shares sold for prices
ranging from $45.13 to $45.50. He couldn't be reached for
comment, but a spokesman for the company said Mr. Loring also
sold to finance a real-estate investment.
   In New York Stock Exchange Trading, Tiffany stock closed
at $45.50, up $1.25.

   FRUIT REDUX: In several sales in May, beleaguered William
F. Farley, chairman of Fruit of the Loom Inc., sold 594,800
shares in the company for $8.1 million, filings with the SEC
show. That's substantially more than Mr. Farley had
previously indicated he planned to sell. As reported last
week, according to a "notice of proposed sale" filed with the
SEC on May 15, Mr. Farley planned to sell as much as $3.9
million of Fruit of the Loom stock, or 280,500 shares "ASAP"
(as soon as possible).
   The latest sales come on top of sales in March and April
of $7.3 million of stock in the Chicago-based underwear,
socks and sweat shirt company, SEC filings show. The sales
come at a time when Farley Inc., the highly leveraged holding
company in which Mr. Farley is the majority stockholder, is
tottering under its mountain of debt. Farley Inc. holds a 20%
stake in Fruit of the Loom.
   Mr. Farley declined to comment.
   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange
yesterday, Fruit of the Loom shares closed at $13.375, up
12.5 cents.
