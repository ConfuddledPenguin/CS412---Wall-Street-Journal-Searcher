principle to buy Blandin Paper Co.'s board plant in Grand
Rapids, Minn., for an amount that wasn't disclosed.
   The company expects the transaction to be final by late
this month.

   A spokesman for Potlatch, a maker of wood products, said
the company bought Blandin's board plant because it is in the
process of doubling its mill capacity in the Minnesota area
and Blandin's plant fits into that expansion.
