   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court expanded the obligation of
states to provide retroactive relief to taxpayers who paid
state taxes that were later found to be unconstitutional.
   The justices ruled, 9-0, that when state taxes are found
to violate established legal principles, such as existing
federal laws or court precedents, a state must give taxpayers
retroactive relief. In such cases, the state should have
known its tax was unconstitutional, the court said.

   But in a second decision, a divided court ruled, 5-4, that
when a decision that a state tax is unconstitutional is based
on a change in the law, then the state's liability for
correcting the tax isn't retroactive.
   Even when retroactive relief is required, however, that
doesn't necessarily mean refunds, the court said. In the
unanimous ruling, the court said that when taxes discriminate
among different groups of taxpayers, a state must either
provide refunds or assess higher back taxes against those who
benefited from the illegal tax.
   The net effect of the two decisions is a defeat for the
states and may cost them billions of dollars if they decide
to pay refunds in a wide range of cases in which taxes were
declared unconstitutional. The precise impact won't be
determined until the states examine the rulings and until
additional court rulings in other cases apply the decisions
to other taxes.
   "The court has given very clear guidance with respect to
the obligations of states to give meaningful relief to
taxpayers," said Walter Hellerstein, a University of Georgia
Law School professor who was a lawyer for one of the parties
in yesterday's rulings.
   Prior to the rulings, the Multistate Tax Commission, a
group of state tax officials, warned last summer that the two
cases potentially could cost some 30 states where taxes have
been declared unconstitutional about $6.5 billion in refunds.
The actual figure is certain to be much lower, given the
limits the court placed on retroactivity. But there may still
be substantial refunds by the states because local lawmakers
may find refunds politically more palatable than increased
back taxes.
   In the unanimous decision, written by Justice William
Brennan, the court required the state of Florida to
retroactively remedy an unconstitutional liquor tax that was
challenged by McKesson Corp., a San Francisco distributor.
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the tax interfered with
interstate commerce by favoring liquor made with Florida
products. But the Florida court declined to order retroactive
relief.
   In the second case, the high court refused to make
retroactive all decisions that invalidate state taxes that
are found to interfere with interstate commerce. The
decision, with no single majority opinion, was a victory for
five states in legal disputes with the American Trucking
Associations over highway taxes that discriminate against
out-of-state companies.
   Yesterday's ruling involved the Arkansas highway tax, but
other cases are pending in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New Jersey
and Vermont. The potential liability in the five states, if
the court had required retroactive refunds, was $630.9
million plus interest.
   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the
court said these states won't be liable for highway taxes
collected before June 1987, when the justices ruled that the
Pennsylvania tax discriminated in favor of trucking companies
based in the state. Before that date, the states had no
reason to know the taxes were unconstitutional, the court
said.
   The ruling means the five states aren't liable to remedy
the effects of the highway taxes collected before the 1987
decision. For four of the five states, that may eliminate
most of the liability because they stopped collecting their
taxes after Pennsylvania's tax was struck down. Only Arkansas
continued to collect its tax, placing the money in an escrow
account that is now likely to be refunded. Yesterday, the
American Trucking Associations said the ruling would still
entitle interstate truckers to $100 million in relief.
   The most closely watched tax dispute that may be affected
by yesterday's rulings involves an issue decided by the
Supreme Court last year. The high court ruled in March 1989
that Michigan unconstitutionally taxed the pensions of
retired federal employees while it exempted the pensions of
state workers. Lawsuits for refunds have been filed by former
federal workers in 24 states, with potential refunds totaling
$2 billion.
   Charles Rothfeld, who filed a brief for the State and
Local Legal Center representing a number of state and local
government groups, said, "It's not clear what the
implications of yesterday's rulings are" for the lawsuits
seeking refunds of taxes on federal pensions.
   Indeed, each state may reach its own decision about
whether to make the pensions ruling retroactive. But the high
court yesterday said the question of whether such rulings are
retroactive must be determined as a matter of federal law
not, as some states urged, based on the laws of individual
states.
   One indication of how those cases will come out may be
found in the separate opinions in the Arkansas highway tax
case yesterday. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring
opinion saying he believes most court rulings should be fully
retroactive, although he wasn't willing to make the truckers'
refunds fully retroactive.
   Justice John Stevens dissented in the Arkansas highway tax
case, joined by Justices Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry
Blackmun. The dissenters said court decisions should be fully
retroactive to all cases filed within the state statute of
limitations period.
   If, as seems likely, the issue of whether the federal
pensions ruling should be applied retroactively comes back to
the high court, Justice Scalia and the four dissenters might
make up a majority to say that it should.
