   Regional Bancorp Inc. said it expects to report a loss for
the second quarter ending June 30. In the year-earlier
period, the bank holding company had net income of $665,000,
or 24 cents a share.
   The Medford, Mass., company also said it will declare a 15
cent dividend, payable July 13 to stock of record June 15.

   "We expect second-quarter results to be adversely affected
by the costs that we were forced to incur in connection with
the recent proxy contest initiated by a shareholder group and
by a special provision of approximately $1.2 million to the
bank's loan-loss reserve," said Thomas F. O'Connor,
president.
   The provision related to nonperforming commercial real
estate loans to a single borrower, said Mr. O'Connor. He
added that the bank holding company has a capital-to-assets
ratio exceeding 13%.
