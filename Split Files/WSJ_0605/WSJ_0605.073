   SEATTLE -- Alaska Airlines, a unit of Alaska Air Group
Inc., said that its May traffic rose 14% to 340.4 million
revenue passenger miles from 299 million flown a year
earlier. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger
flown one mile.
   The month's passenger load factor, or the percentage of
available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers, rose
slightly to 50.2% from 50.9% in May 1989.
