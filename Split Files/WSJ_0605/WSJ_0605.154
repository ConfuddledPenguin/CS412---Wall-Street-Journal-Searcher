   Auburn Hills, Mich. -- Yeah, I know, NBA basketball has
been fantastic since Julius Erving demonstrated that man
could fly without tickets, but as I walked through the
parking lot at The Palace here on a sunny, breezy Sunday
afternoon last, before the Detroit Pistons-Chicago Bulls
playoff finale, it occurred to me that one change wouldn't
hurt. If the league insists on playing in June, it ought to
take the game outdoors.
   Think of the possibilities. You could have wind and
calm-air shooting specialists, and, like tennis, move the
show periodically among grass, dirt and concrete. Think of
the great arguments: "Sure, the Knicks are good on concrete,
but can they beat the Lakers on grass?" It would add new
dimensions to the sport.

   Come to think of it, though, maybe it is that way already
except for the sunshine, and that stuff on the floors of
league arenas only looks like wood. How else to explain the
home-court advantage that has come to dominate the current
playoffs?
   When the Pistons dispatched the Bulls, 93-74, on Sunday,
they completed a sweep of the seven-game Eastern Conference
final for the home teams. In the Western section of the
semis, hosts proved equally inhospitable through game five
before the Portland Trailblazers ended the string by
eclipsing the Phoenix Suns, 112-109, at Phoenix on Thursday
night. And the Blazers mightn't have managed that if Kevin
Johnson, the do-everything Suns guard, hadn't retired in the
second quarter with a hamstring pull.
   For the playoffs as a whole, home teams won 53 of 67
games, which ought to give the league pause. Is someone
squeezing the basket rims on the visitors' ends, or, perhaps,
raising them a tad? "I've heard that said," said Piston guard
Vinnie Johnson, with mock seriousness, after Sunday's fray.
"Sometimes, it's seemed that way to me."
   "The noise here today {from the 21,454 Pistomanics in
attendance} was a big, big factor," offered Chuck Daly, the
winners' coach. "I haven't heard that kind of crowd noise
since we moved to this building" at the start of last season.
   He added: "For awhile there, I thought this was Chicago
Stadium." He must've noticed the difference when he didn't
hear the ubiquitous road-cry "Laimbeer ---s," in honor of
Bill, the ever-popular Pistons center.
   Whatever, something was working for Detroit. The defending
NBA champs, who'd been jammed, 109-91, in Chicago just two
days before, emerged from a close-played first quarter to
blitz the Bulls in quarter two, and never looked back. They
outscored Chicago 23-6 during the last eight minutes of the
first half to take a 15-point lead, and the visitors never
again got closer than 10.
   The Bulls hit on only 28 of 90 field goal tries, or 31%,
compared with a 48% mark in Home Sweet Home on Friday, so
maybe somebody was fiddling with their rims. Their 74 points
will enter the Pistons' record book for fewest points allowed
in a playoff game, no small matter for such a
defense-oriented club.
   If it wasn't for his highness, Michael Jordan, the Bulls
might have come close to being shut out. Jordan scored 31
points, six below his playoff average, but 21 more than
anyone else on his team, and he shot a respectable 13 of 27
from the field.
   After the Pistons' second-quarter surge produced their
commanding lead, Jordan seemingly decided to take them on
alone. From the start of the second half until the game's
dying minutes, he either scored or assisted on 32 of the
Bulls' 37 points. Then, inevitably, he pooped out, and
Detroit stretched its advantage from 82-70 to the final
count.
   "I saw my job as trying to take some of the pressure off
my teammates, hoping they'd feed off me," Jordan said. The
Pistons ate their lunch instead.
   First in the chow line was Isiah Thomas, the veteran
Detroit guard. He darted through the visitors for 21 points,
and had 11 assists and eight rebounds to boot. Daly later
called it Thomas's best game of the playoffs, and maybe of
the whole season. Isiah said he thought it was his best game
of this series, anyway, but he smiled when he said it.
   The Pistons' defensive stalwart was John Salley, their
lean, 6-foot-11 front-court reserve. He blocked five Bulls'
shots in the game, four of them during the second-quarter
run. Daly had substituted Salley and 6-6 forward Mark Aguirre
for the bulkier starting duo of Laimbeer and James Edwards,
and a couple of the Salley blocks led to Aguirre layups past
flat-footed Bulls on the other end.
   "Everything clicked" during the spurt, recalled Aguirre.
"We have 10- or 12-point runs all the time, but this one went
on and on. Picked a good time for it, didn't we?"
   And so the NBA finals will open with Detroit facing
Portland tonight, and it might be interesting to imagine it
on the various outdoor surfaces. The Blazers' swifties --
Clyde Drexler and Jerome Kersey -- probably would match
Thomas and Aguirre well on fast tracks like grass or
concrete, and their Clydesdales -- Buck Williams and Kevin
Duckworth -- would balance out Laimbeer and Edwards on slower
clay. The other guards, Portland's Terry Porter and Detroit's
Joe Dumars, seem like all-around fellas, good no matter
what's under foot.
   Alas, the series will be indoors, on wood. It will start
in Detroit and end there if it goes the full seven games, by
virtue of the Pistons' divisional championship. And if the
future repeats the past, therein will lie the edge. Asked if
he was glad to be in a third-straight championship round with
his mates, the 7-foot-1 Edwards said he was mostly glad he
wouldn't have to play again in Chicago until next fall.
   Aguirre put the matter in further perspective by noting
that a coming trip or two to the Great Northwest wouldn't
faze him. "We don't have to beat them there as long as we
beat them here," said he.
