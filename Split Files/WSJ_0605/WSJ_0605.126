   NEW YORK -- The mark rose broadly, defying earlier
predictions of a sell-off in the absence of a Bush-Gorbachev
agreement on the military status of a unified Germany.
   The dollar was lower against the West German currency, but
rose against the yen, participants said. The market was
thinned by a holiday in several European countries, including
West Germany.

   Traders said the market's perception of the importance of
an accord on Germany shifted following the conclusion Sunday
of the four-day summit in Washington. A market consensus
developed that Soviet policy won't be as crucial a factor in
German integration as previously supposed.
   Participants concluded that any compromise on the issue of
German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
likely will be a drawn-out process, and as such won't
preclude the economic and social integration set for July 2
under the Germanys' recently signed treaty, traders said.
   News that U.S. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev directed their respective foreign ministers to hold
talks on the issue at meetings during the next several weeks
bolstered that view, dealers said.
   There was nervousness in the market last week that
continued Soviet opposition to Germany joining NATO could
delay unification, leading participants to predict a mark
fall if Messrs. Bush and Gorbachev couldn't reach a
compromise on the issue at the summit.
   In the absence of any great concern with the issue of
German NATO membership, market participants returned their
focus to economic fundamentals, bidding the mark higher on
the belief in an eventual raising of interest rates by the
West German Bundesbank, said Peter Iversen, a trader at
Shawmut Bank of Boston.
   The mark was helped against the U.S. currency by the
dollar's failure to push through important technical levels
above 1.70 marks during a rally earlier in the New York day,
a development that led participants to try selling the
dollar, Mr. Iversen and others said.
   The market was also wary of intervention on behalf of the
Bundesbank above 1.70 marks, leading to some trepidation at
bidding the dollar higher aggressively, said Baruch Deutsch,
a dealer at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.
   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at
1.6855 marks, down from 1.6980 marks late Friday, and at
152.40 yen, up from 151.85 yen. Sterling was at $1.6810,
unchanged from late Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 152.20 yen soon
after opening at 152.36 yen and down from Monday's Tokyo
close of 152.42 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading
at about 1.6890 marks.
   But Mr. Deutsch and others said the dollar was prevented
from falling too far by a lack of news to push it
aggressively lower, especially in light of the market's
conviction that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will
maintain the Fed's current policy of steady interest rates.
   The U.S. received some support from the rise of stock
prices on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The industrial
average reached a record high of 2935.19, up 34.22 points on
the day. The previous record high was 2900.97, recorded
Friday.
   A round of three-day system-repurchase agreements executed
Monday by the Fed was dismissed as a technical adjustment of
the Federal Funds rate and not a signal that the central bank
might be preparing moves to lower interest rates, said John
Lynam, a vice president at Security Pacific International
Bank, New York.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said he is
"optimistic" a budget accord can be reached that would reduce
U.S. interest rates. The statement caused the dollar to slip
slightly.
   The yen fell against the West German and U.S. currencies,
beset by continuing market concern about what impact a fall
in real-estate prices might have on large Japanese financial
institutions with a large exposure to loans secured by
real-estate holdings, dealers said.
   Sterling fell against the dollar and mark as the
expectations of a quick entry of Britain into the Exchange
Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System continued to
deflate, said Mr. Lynam.
   In Europe, the dollar was mostly weaker, although activity
was thinned by European holidays. In Tokyo, the dollar was
higher as traders followed through on gains in the currency
last week.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold
settled at $358.60 an ounce, down 60 cents. Estimated volume
was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $358.25 an ounce.
