   NFC PLC of Britain reported a 12% rise in pretax profit
for the 25 weeks ended March 24 to #36.4 million ($61.2
million) from #32.6 million in the 24-week period a year
earlier.
   But the diversified freight hauling company reduced its
full-year forecast, citing a slowdown in its transport and
property divisions. NFC said its "best view" is that pretax
profit will total #97 million, up 7.5% from #90.2 million a
year earlier, but down from its earlier forecast of #105
million.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests for the fiscal
first half rose 17% to #27 million from #23 million a year
earlier. Earnings per share rose 8.8% to 4.9 pence from 4.5
pence. Profit attributable to shareholders also totaled #27
million, up 41% from #19.2 million a year earlier, after a
#3.8 million extraordinary loss. The latest period didn't
include any special items. Sales rose 13% to #729 million
from #648 million.
   NFC said it agreed to acquire S.A. Distribuidora EMA,
Spain's third-largest transport and distribution company, for
one billion pesetas ($9.5 million).
