   NEW YORK -- Osborn Communications Corp. said it expects to
have a second-quarter pre-tax gain of about $1 million, or 14
cents a share, from repurchase of debt.
   The radio, television and cable TV operator said it
repurchased $4 million of 13.875% debentures for about $2.8
million, to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce interest
costs.
