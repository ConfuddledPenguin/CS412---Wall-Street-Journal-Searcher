   Boeing Co. said that Linjeflyg, a Swedish domestic
airline, converted options on four 737-500 jetliners into
firm orders that Boeing valued at $130 million, including
spare parts.
   The initial order, placed in August 1988, included six
737-500s and options on six more. All of the planes ordered
by Linjeflyg will be powered by engines produced by a joint
venture of General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., and
France's state-owned Snecma.

   Seattle-based Boeing said the latest order brings to 215
the total orders for the advanced-technology twinjet. The
737-500s can be configured to seat between 108 and 132
passengers. Boeing said that initial deliveries of the
737-500 to other customers began in February.
