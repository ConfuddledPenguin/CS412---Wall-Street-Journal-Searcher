   NEW YORK -- Interco Inc.'s chief executive officer,
Richard Loynd, told creditors they have the right to oust
him. But Mr. Loynd asked to stay on, saying he could fix the
ailing conglomerate's problems.
   Mr. Loynd spoke at a 2 1/2-hour, closed-door meeting with
bondholders. Interco, which is seeking to restructure its
$1.6 billion in debt, has said it may seek protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Interco has posted
heavy losses for more than a year. The company is known for
its Florsheim and Converse shoe brands, as well as its Lane
and Broyhill furniture divisions.

   Yesterday's meeting was closed to the press, but several
participants in both the bondholder and management camps
provided detailed accounts.
   "You guys own the company," Mr. Loynd reportedly told
bondholders. "We're working for you." As part of its
restructuring plan, Interco is offering bondholders a massive
debt-for-equity swap that would leave them with about 70%
ownership in the company.
   Mr. Loynd told bondholders "if you want to fire me, you
can," recalled Andrew Herenstein, a credit analyst for
Delaware Bay Co. "But he went on to say that he had operating
experience and was the right guy for the situation."
   Mr. Loynd took over as chief executive last spring. His
predecessor, Harvey Saligman, had overseen a recapitalization
of Interco in late 1988 that fought off a hostile raider but
left the company heavily in debt. Before taking the top job
at Interco, Mr. Loynd had been chief executive of Interco's
Converse division.
   Several bondholders yesterday urged Interco to consider
selling Converse, which has been the most erratic financial
performer of the major operating units. Mr. Loynd reiterated
Interco's desire to keep all four units. He also said
potential buyers haven't offered an attractive price for
Converse. But Mr. Loynd didn't rule out a Converse sale if
the right price were offered.
   Mr. Loynd also said Interco had looked at selling the
entire company, but couldn't find a buyer interested in all
four units. Liquidating the company piecemeal would create
more tax liabilities than would be desirable, he added.
   After the meeting, Interco's bondholders took steps to
form a formal creditors' committee, to be represented by
Rothschild Inc. Leading bondholders include Dickstein &amp; Co.,
Prudential Insurance Co., Gateway Investment Advisers Inc.,
Allen &amp; Co., Cypress Capital and CNA Insurance Co.
   Interco has said it will default on a June 15 interest
payment due on its 13 3/4% senior subordinated bonds. The
company is urging bondholders to accept a package of new
securities that offers mostly equity and little in the way of
cash-paying securities.
