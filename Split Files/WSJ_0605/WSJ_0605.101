   Sprouse-Reitz Stores Inc. said it will begin discussions
with parties interested in acquiring all or part of the
company, sparking a surge in its stock.
   The Portland, Ore.-based company said it isn't certain
that such discussions will lead to a sale. The general
merchandise retail chain also said it would continue to
evaluate other methods of enhancing shareholder value.

chairman of TransAction Financial Corp. of Oakland, Calif.
