   RIVERTON, Wyo. -- U.S. Energy Corp. and its Crested Corp.
unit said they completed the formation of a joint venture
with Kennecott Corp. to produce uranium in south-central
Wyoming.
   The two companies said that Kennecott paid them $9 million
last Friday and $6 million previously for a 50% interest in
the mineral and other properties owned by U.S. Energy and its
affiliates.

   Kennecott, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, has agreed to
fund the first $50 million in expenses on the project and to
pay additional operating costs for U.S. Energy and Crested
based on the price it receives for uranium oxide.
