   Why did Coca-Cola Co. can its MagiCans promotion?
   Maybe it had something to do with the bomb squad in San
Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Early last month, toward the end of a United Airlines
flight from Chicago to San Francisco, a flight attendant
popped open an ordinary-looking can of Coca-Cola Classic. But
the attendant became suspicious when she tried to pour it,
and nothing came out. By the weight of the can, she could
tell something was in there.
   As soon as the plane landed, the crew immediately rushed
all the passengers off. The Coca-Cola can was whisked to a
remote area. The bomb squad was called out. Surrounding the
Coke can, the bomb technicians opened it -- and found a $10
bill.
   Although the technicians determined they didn't have a
bomb on their hands, it soon became evident that the people
at Coke did. Last week, under the crush of bad publicity
about defective cans, Coca-Cola confirmed that it had halted
distribution of the MagiCans, prize-filled cans randomly
mixed with real ones.
   But even as the last cans disappear from store shelves,
the demise of MagiCans only three weeks after their launch
doesn't signal the end of such promotions. Marketing experts
predict that innovative, high-tech promotions such as
MagiCans, which eject cash when popped open, probably will
increase because they serve one important purpose: cutting
through a glut of advertising.
   "There's got to be a stopper," says Jesse Meyers,
publisher of trade newsletter, Beverage Digest. "The stopper
of today and tomorrow {in soft drinks} is technology." As a
direct result of MagiCans' problems -- some 70 consumers have
called Coke to complain that their cans were broken -- Mr.
Meyers believes testing periods for such technically oriented
promotions will be lengthened from several weeks to several
months.
   What might the next big promotion be? Would you believe
MagiCans? Coke is so enamored of MagiCans' potential that it
has already considered relaunching the program in the future
-- perhaps later this year -- according to people familiar
with the company's plans. Before any definite decision is
made, the company is pursuing an investigation into every
structural, chemical and marketing aspect of the MagiCan
program.
   With solid double-digit sales gains in the first three
weeks of the promotion, the sources said, Coke is convinced
it still has a winner -- only a temporarily broken one.
Therefore, pulling the promotion early on may allow Coke to
limit damage that could thwart a relaunch of MagiCans.
   Coke didn't have any immediate comment on its plans.
   Coke's adventure with MagiCans -- the malfunctions, the
bomb scare, the big launch and the quick retreat -- may serve
well as a promotional primer, illustrating both marketing
mastery and missteps.
   It seemed an easy-to-understand, sure-fire blockbuster.
Instant-win cans. A buyer pops the top, and cash or
certificates for prizes immediately eject. But what seemed so
simple and exciting in concept proved to be less so in
reality.
   For starters, test markets in Iowa and Illinois last fall
indicated there could be problems. As designed, the cans were
supposed to yield one thing when opened: a prize. Instead of
the Coke beverage, the cans were filled with water (which was
supposed to be sealed off and inaccessible) to give the
MagiCan the feel of the real thing.
   But last fall at least one curious person in a market test
of the MagiCans had broken into a can to look at the prize
contraption. Despite that sign of trouble, one former Coke
employee involved with MagiCans says, "drinking the liquid .
. . was deemed such a long shot that it was a risk not fully
taken into consideration."
   The long shot, however, came through right away. In the
first week of the promotion, an 11-year-old Massachusetts boy
popped open his can, and because of a defect, drank some of
the water. (The water is harmless but foul-tasting.) The
boy's story set off a flood of negative publicity nationwide.
   Broken cans aside, Coke quickly learned that the concept
was difficult for consumers to understand. After TV ads
launched the MagiCans promotion, some consumers thought the
cash coming out of the cans in the commercials was simply a
metaphor, not to be taken literally.
   One person involved in the promotional plans said there
was so much enthusiastic discussion about MagiCans that Coke
lost sight of the fact that the cans were so unusual that
they required thorough explanation for the man on the street.
"We were just too close to it," says the individual. So Coke
began rejiggering the television ads to stress that there
really was cash in cans.
   Failing to fully recognize some of the pitfalls in advance
is a classic example, some marketing experts say, of falling
head over heels for a creative idea. "Once they fall in love
with it, it develops a life of its own, and there's no
stopping it," says Gary M. Stibel, a principal with the New
England Consulting Group, Westport, Conn.
   As soft-drink companies vie for consumer attention,
promotions are becoming riskier. Last summer, PepsiCo Inc.
got burned with an ad featuring rock star Madonna. Pepsi
yanked the spot under pressure from religious groups, who
were offended by a rock video Madonna had made (in which she
dances around burning crosses), even though the video was
unrelated to the Pepsi commercial.
   But marketers say tinkering with the actual product or
packaging of a consumer good that can be ingested requires
extraordinary caution. Pepsi says it had considered a similar
prizes-in-cans promotion last year, but opted against it,
partly because of worries that people might drink something
from a Pepsi can that they weren't supposed to.
   "When you are dealing with a food or beverage product,
even one failure in a million is unacceptable," says John
Lister, chief executive officer of Lister Butler Inc., a
brand and corporate identity concern based in New York.
   In Atlanta last month, frustrated Coke marketers shook
their heads as they watched videotapes of the Massachusetts
boy appearing on a local news show, and worried that the
publicity might damage the image of its flagship brand,
Coca-Cola Classic.
   With more than a dozen reports of broken mechanisms on
hand by the third week of May, Coke set about a massive
research effort to find out how many of the cans were broken.
By simply shaking the cans and listening for rattles, the
company determined that fewer than 1% of the cans were
broken. The company issued a news release acknowledging a
"small number" of defects.
   Meanwhile, as internal debate raged about whether to
proceed with the promotion or pull it, Coke fired off
full-page newspaper ads to show consumers what a broken
MagiCan looks like compared with a working one. The ads
advised against drinking the water, and gave consumers a
toll-free number to phone in complaints.
   Marketing experts praised the openness of Coke's
disclosure, which signaled to the public that big corporate
Coke, which had suffered embarrassment five years ago over
the New Coke fiasco, could still own up to its mistakes. By
contrast, Perrier was criticized for not being aggressive
enough in informing consumers quickly about the contamination
of its bottled water earlier this year.
   Deciding it was pointless "to put out brushfires all
summer," as one insider says, the company called it quits
last week. The promotion was supposed to run until
mid-August. But Coke opted to put a positive spin on the
finale, with ads that stated: "The last MagiCans are out
there, but not for long . . ."
   Says John Margaritas, chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Public
Relations in New York, "Once you risk any damage to your
brand name, then you need to quickly do whatever you can to
save the brand."
