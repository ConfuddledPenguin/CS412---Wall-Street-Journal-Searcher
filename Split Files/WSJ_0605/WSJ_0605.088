   CHICAGO -- Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s plan to convert its
thinly traded common stock into separate voting and nonvoting
classes is under fire from a major shareholder, Industrial
Equity (Pacific) Ltd.
   The plan, announced last month by the publishing and
entertainment concern, would allow it to issue more shares
while preserving founder Hugh Hefner's control of the
company. The 64-year-old former chairman and chief executive,
who owns a 71% stake, could retain voting control of Playboy
while disposing of up to three-quarters of his holdings.

   But Industrial Equity, an investment firm based in Hong
Kong, whose 7.6% stake makes it Playboy's second largest
holder, objects. In a May 31 letter to Playboy, IEP
Consultants (USA) Inc., an affiliate of Industrial Equity,
said the stock conversion proposal is unfair to holders who
have purchased their shares on a one-share, one-vote
structure.
   The letter, which was attached to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing, specifically objected to the idea
of Mr. Hefner retaining voting control if he sells his
majority interest.
   "The proposed plan gives all stockholders the same
proportionate voting rights and the same flexibility to
determine their continuing ownership of voting and nonvoting
stock," a Playboy spokesman said. "The plan contains an
unusual minority protection provision that is designed to
help ensure price parity between the two classes of stock,
and we plan to go forward with the plan as described in the
company's consent solicitation statement."
   Industrial Equity officials didn't return calls seeking
further comment.
   Dual-class arrangements aren't rare in the publishing
business: founding families of New York Times Co., Dow Jones
&amp; Co. and Washington Post Co., for example, all maintain
voting control through special classes of stock.
   Playboy's plan calls for it to carry out a 1-for-2 reverse
split of its current shares, reducing the number of common
shares outstanding to 4.7 million from 9.4 million. Those
shares will then be reclassified as Class A stock, each
having one vote. The Class A shares will then each pay a
dividend of three shares of nonvoting Class B Playboy shares,
which the company will seek to have traded on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Playboy has said the plan will provide management with
additional financial flexibility by permitting it to use
equity for possible future acquisitions, financings and
employee benefit plans -- without diluting Mr. Hefner's
control.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Playboy closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents.
