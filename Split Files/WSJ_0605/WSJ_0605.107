   Dress Barn Inc., Stamford, Conn., reported a 7% increase
in earnings for its third quarter but a 26% decline for the
nine months ended April 28.
   The operator of a chain of off-price women's apparel
retail stores said earnings for the quarter rose to $4
million, or 18 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 17 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 18% to $70.6 million from
$59.8 million.

   For the nine months, earnings fell to $10.1 million, or 45
cents a share, from $13.7 million, or 61 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $208.3 million from $183.6
million.
   Dress Barn said it believes the quarter's results "signify
the end of the promotional retail turmoil of the prior six
months." It said it expects a return to its traditional
growth pattern.
   Off-price apparel chains recently have been pressed as
department stores and other retailers undertook big
promotions and widespread discounting.
   Dress Barn said as of April 28 it had 456 stores
operating, a rise of 54 from a year earlier. It said it
planned to have 470 stores operating by the end of fiscal
1990.
