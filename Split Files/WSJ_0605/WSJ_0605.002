   First Venice has $57 million of deposits and NBD will
acquire $46 million of assets, which are primarily
residential mortgage loans. NBD Chairman Charles T. Fisher
III said the acquisition will help NBD deliver custom banking
services to NBD trust customers in Florida. "We do not intend
to become a major player in the savings and loan business,"
Mr. Fisher said.
