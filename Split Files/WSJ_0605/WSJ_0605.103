   Columbia Hospital Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, said it
definitively agreed to acquire HEI Corp. of Houston, also a
hospital company, for $4.50 a share, or about $22 million.
   Columbia said it plans to begin by next Monday a tender
offer for HEI that will be contingent on at least 90% of
HEI's shares being tendered. In national over-the-counter
trading yesterday, HEI shares jumped $1.46875, to close at
$4.125.

   HEI, which owns three Texas hospitals, repeatedly rebuffed
offers last year from Hospital Partners Ltd., a San Antonio
limited partnership, saying it wasn't for sale. But Robert
Hux, HEI president and chief executive officer, said Columbia
provided a commitment letter from Citibank, showing it could
finance the transaction, while Hospital Partners didn't have
financing.
   Columbia, founded in 1987 by Richard L. Scott and a former
Bass family adviser, Richard E. Rainwater, operates seven
hospitals in Texas and Florida. It recently became publicly
traded when it merged with Smith Laboratories Inc., a San
Diego-based medical equipment concern.
