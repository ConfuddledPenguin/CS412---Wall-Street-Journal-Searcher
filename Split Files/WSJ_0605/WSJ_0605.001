   DETROIT -- MCN Corp., a natural gas utility holding
company with data processing, natural gas technology and
energy services units, said it agreed to buy the Genix
Enterprises Inc. data processing subsidiary of National
Intergroup Inc., a Pittsburgh-based drug distributor and
steel company, for $20 million in cash and notes, subject to
change through the closing, expected by June 30.
   National Intergroup said the sale is expected to result in
a one-time, pretax gain of $13 million. The deal is subject
to approval by MCN's board later this month. National
Intergroup founded Genix in 1984 as an information services
unit that provides mainframe computer operations services.
