   CHICAGO -- Soybean futures prices skidded as a break in
the season's persistent wet weather allowed farmers to make
some long-delayed progress in planting.
   Illinois and Iowa were expected to remain mostly dry
through tomorrow, with a chance of rain again Thursday and
Friday. Temperatures are expected to rise late this week,
which also would help the emerging crop.

   A continuation of wet, cool weather would have meant a
reduction in the likely size of the soybean harvest. Wet
weather in May caused some analysts to trim their forecasts
for the corn crop.
   Soybeans for July delivery fell 9.25 cents a bushel
yesterday to settle at $5.9275. The July corn contract fell
two cents a bushel to $2.7375, but wheat for July delivery
rose 1.75 cents a bushel to $3.31.
   The soybean contract was down about 12 cents and the corn
contract off about four cents early in the session, but
prices recovered slightly before the close at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Analysts said the decline in corn prices followed news
that the weather had improved just in time for many farmers
to meet the corn-planting deadline. It's a rule of thumb that
for maximum yields, most Midwest corn fields must be planted
by June 1.
   Soybeans can be planted later than corn, so farmers who
miss corn-planting deadlines tend to shift to soybeans.
   Planting in the Midwest soared last week because of the
dry weather. Iowa officials said that 65% of soybean acres
were planted as of Sunday, compared with 26% a week ago. Last
year at that time, however, 98% of planting was completed. In
Illinois, soybean fields were 46% planted, compared with 17%
a week ago and 81% last year.
   Corn planting was 94% complete in Iowa, compared with 87%
last week and 100% last year. Corn planting in Illinois was
79% complete as of Sunday, compared with 71% a week ago and
100% at the same time last year.
   Traders shrugged off developments at the summit meeting
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   "If anything, what happened at the summit was maybe a
little better than expected," said Mario Balletto, analyst
for Merrill Lynch, but "the summit really played no role in
these {price} drops."
   At the summit, Mr. Bush agreed to ease trade restrictions
on the Soviet Union, but congressional leaders are still
demanding that the improvement be made contingent on Moscow's
easing its stance on emigration of Soviet Jews and on
Lithuania's demands for independence.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices fell amid reports that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hadn't
significantly reduced oil production in May. Market
participants view OPEC's ability to trim its output as
possibly the most crucial factor in the energy market this
summer because of the current huge buildup of crude-oil
supplies. West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery
ended at $17.14 a barrel, off 36 cents. Some traders said the
next technical floor for the July contract is $16.90 a
barrel, a level they said could be tested shortly. Gasoline
prices also fell, with unleaded for July delivery finishing
at 59.58 cents a gallon, down 1.20 cents. News of a fire at a
Kerr-McGee Corp. refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, didn't
affect prices, traders said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold future prices extended Friday's
declines with an across-the-board drop to life-of-contracts
lows. Silver edged higher, and platinum eased. Trading was
light. August gold ended with a loss of $1.10 an ounce at
$362.40 after trading at a new low of $359.60. London prices
eased in sympathy with Friday's losses in New York, and
London's weakness was then reflected again in New York,
analysts said. The market also continued to be affected by
Soviet sales and possible swaps of gold to try to obtain
foreign exchange, one analyst said. Another analyst, Greg
Klochkoff, vice president of Bank of Boston in Providence,
R.I., said traders appeared to waiting to see how much Soviet
gold the market could absorb. "I think there will be a
further slight dip and a good chance of some recovery later
in the week," Mr. Klochkoff said. July silver was up 0.2 cent
an ounce at $5.0820. "Silver prices have been at an extremely
low level in a vastly oversold market," said Peter Cardillo,
trading adviser at Josephthal &amp; Co., New York. At current
levels, with prices below production costs, the market may be
establishing a base from which to stage a rally, he said.
According to Mr. Cardillo, the same is true of gold, which he
also termed an oversold market in which a rebound couldn't be
counted out. July platinum was off $1.20 to $486.80 an ounce.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices fell, with the July contract ending
with a loss of $30 a metric ton at $1,317. At one point, the
contract traded as low as $1,283. The strong demand that was
generated in recent weeks by political turmoil in the Ivory
Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, has been slacking
off as the political situation has stabilized, according to
analysts. While a quieter Ivory Coast has been the major
price depressant, the Soviet Union's foreign exchange
difficulties also have played a part, one analyst said.
Moscow's reported requests for credit extensions last week
raised the possibility that some of the cocoa the Soviets
have contracted to buy may be resold on the world market, the
analyst said. The Soviet Union accounts for about 7% of world
cocoa consumption, the analyst said.
