   LOS ANGELES -- L.A. Gear Inc. was hit with a rash of
shareholder lawsuits in the wake of its announcement Friday
that it expects to post a sharp drop in net income for the
quarter ended May 31.
   A total of 15 lawsuits were filed in federal court here,
all alleging that the Marina del Rey, Calif., sneaker
company's officers and directors issued a series of false and
misleading statements to inflate the company's stock price
and conceal adverse information. L.A. Gear's stock has
plummeted nearly $20 a share in the past 1 1/2 weeks, from a
record high of $50.375 a share, when the company announced
late last month that it had signed singer Paula Abdul as a
celebrity endorser.

   The bulk of the stock drop came Friday, when L.A. Gear
announced that it would report second-quarter per-share net
income of between 50 cents and 60 cents, compared with 91
cents a year earlier. The company blamed the drop on its
product mix, with increased sales of lower-priced, less
profitable shoes that it had pushed to gain market share and
retail shelf space, coupled with increased sales of its
lower-margin apparel and international footwear.
   An L.A. Gear spokeswoman said the company hadn't been
served with the lawsuits and, therefore, couldn't comment.
   Fourteen of the lawsuits were identical in language and
were filed by the same local counsel on behalf of plaintiffs
and other attorneys around the country. They seek unspecified
damages, plus treble punitive damages under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The suits seek
class-action status on behalf of shareholders who bought L.A.
Gear stock between Sept. 29, 1989, and June 1.
   The other complaint, filed on behalf of investor Joseph
Scorese, is for a class of investors who bought L.A. Gear
shares between May 14 and June 1 this year. It also seeks
unspecified damages.
   The 14 suits charge that nine company officers grossed
almost $33 million by selling 1.1 million shares since last
fall while in possession of adverse inside information about
the company's business. The figures don't include stock sales
made last month, the complaints said. The suits also repeat
allegations from previous suits against the company that the
value of imports had been understated to avoid import duties
and that investors had been misled into believing that L.A.
Gear could diversify and adapt to fashion trends.
