   Campeau Corp.'s retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported widened losses
for April compared with March, but the units said the losses
were lower than expected.
   In documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Cincinnati, Federated said it had a net loss of $12.7 million
in the four weeks ended May 5, while Allied said it had a net
loss of $11.8 million. The results don't include expenses
related to the units' Chapter 11 bankruptcy status.

   Federated and Allied had net losses of $8.9 million and
$9.1 million, respectively, in the five weeks ended April 7.
Comparable figures for the year-earlier periods weren't
provided, making it difficult for analysts to gauge the
retailers' financial progress since seeking protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on
Jan. 15.
   "This is tough to read," said Janet Mangano, analyst at
Josephthal and Co. of New York. "It is hard to make a
determination of whether there has been an improvement or
deterioration in operations if the numbers aren't compared on
a year-to-year basis," she said.
   In a statement, Allen Questrom, chairman and chief
executive officer of Federated and Allied, said sales and
operating earnings in the combined March-April period were as
high as management expected.
   "I think any weakness in the business that we currently
are experiencing is related more to the general retail
climate than to Federated and Allied in particular," he said.
   "I agree with that statement. It is certainly true," said
Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, a New
York-based newsletter.
   Mr. Barnard said retailers of moderately priced clothing
had markedly better sales growth during this year's Easter
season than last year, but many department store concerns
actually showed lower sales. Federated and Allied were hit
harder because they sell higher-priced clothing, he said.
   "Federated and Allied did not do better and probably did
not do much worse than the rest of the department store
industry," Mr. Barnard said.
   Federated's sales in April were $325.8 million, down 20%
from $405.3 million in March. Allied had April sales of
$190.2 million, down 19% from March sales of $234.4 million.
   In the combined March-April period, Federated had
operating cash flow of $61.6 million, while Allied generated
$32.1 million. Federated and Allied said operating cash flow,
defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and costs related to their bankruptcy-law
status, is the most accurate measure of their business under
Chapter 11.
   Separately, Ralphs Grocery Co., a Southern California
supermarket chain indirectly owned by Campeau, a
Toronto-based real estate and retailing concern, released its
first-quarter results. In the three months ended April 22,
the firm's net loss narrowed to $4 million from $7 million a
year earlier. Sales improved 8.5% to $620.9 million from
$572.5 million.
   Ralphs hasn't filed for protection under Chapter 11. But
it is owned by Allied and Federated Holdings III, another
Campeau unit that is in Chapter 11.
   Meanwhile, National Bank of Canada said it extended a
deadline under which Robert Campeau, Campeau's chairman and
chief executive officer, can pay 40 million Canadian dollars
(US$34.1 million) to reclaim Campeau securities seized by the
bank. Mr. Campeau missed the May 31 deadline for the
transaction. National Bank didn't disclose the date of the
new deadline.
   National Bank seized Campeau common shares, preference
stock and convertible debentures in January when it claimed
Mr. Campeau defaulted on about C$153 million of personal
loans. The seizure lowered Mr. Campeau's fully diluted stake
in the company that bears his name to 21% from 43%. He will
regain control of Campeau if he buys the shares back.
