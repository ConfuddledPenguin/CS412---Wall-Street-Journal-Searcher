   NEW YORK -- Financial issues took center stage as the
stock market posted a broad-based advance that resulted in
yet another series of records.
   Expectations that interest rates would continue to fall in
the aftermath of Friday's weak report on May employment led
to brisk activity among financial stocks, which have lagged
the market through much of the year.

   The broad market showed little direction through
midafternoon, when the buying interest in the financial
sector and futures-related buy programs combined to ignite a
rally that broke the Dow Jones Industrial Average from a
trading range on either side of 2900.
   The average, which finished last week just above that
level, posted its fourth record close in the past five
sessions and its 10th since May 14 by surging 34.22 to
2935.19.
   At the same time, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index became the latest market measure to establish a record
by rallying 2.18 to 200.21. The prior high was 199.34, set
last Oct. 9.
   Among other broad measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index climbed 4.24 to 367.40 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 4.15 to 341.98 -- both records.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,105 to 477 on
the Big Board, where trading remained fairly active. About
175,520,000 shares changed hands on the Big Board, compared
with 187,860,000 shares Friday.
   Investors looking to shift assets out of cash and into
stocks "are gradually deciding that they can't wait any
longer" before they start doing some buying, said John D.
Connolly, chairman of the investment committee at Dean Witter
Reynolds. "That's what markets like this do -- they just
freeze out anyone who has cash."
   Traders cited the bond market's ability to build on its
sharp gains Friday in response to the jobs data as a chief
factor behind the latest surge in stocks. Long-term Treasury
bonds added 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, after
surging about 1 1/2 points Friday.
   Also, a round of program buying stemming from stock-index
arbitrage that surfaced just after 2 p.m. EDT served as a
catalyst for the rally. Buy programs, involving the purchase
of baskets of stocks and the sale of index-futures contracts
to profit from the price differential between them, boosted
stocks in the final hour of trading as well.
   Mr. Connolly noted that the financial sector's surge was
in line with its relative strength in the past four weeks.
Financial issues that he tracks have gained an average of
9.9% during that period, compared with a 7.8% rise among the
top 1,000 issues in terms of their market capitalization.
   With concerns about problem loans and other issues having
weighed on the group so far this year, "what we're seeing is
a feeling that the negativity was overdone on financial
stocks and that we're going to see an improving situation
from here," he said.
   Financial stocks dominated the list of most active issues
on the Big Board. One of them was First Interstate Bancorp,
which rallied 4 7/8 to 44 7/8 as dividend-related activity
and takeover speculation combined to produce composite volume
of 1.9 million shares. The bank issue carries a 7% dividend
yield and went ex-dividend yesterday; separately, Security
Pacific has expressed an interest in the company in the past.
First Interstate said it couldn't account for the activity in
its stock.
   Other actively traded stocks in the group included
American Express, which went up 1 7/8 to 31 5/8 as 2.1
million shares changed hands; Travelers, up 1 1/8 to 31 7/8
on 1.5 million shares; Federal National Mortgage Association,
up 2 to 43 5/8 on 1.9 million shares; J.P. Morgan, up 5/8 to
39 1/2 on 1.7 million shares, and Citicorp, up 5/8 to 24 5/8
on 1.6 million shares.
   Optimism about interest rates also led to interest of
utility stocks, giving the Dow Jones Utilities Average its
first back-to-back advance since mid-May. The average rose
3.71 to 215.42 after a gain of 0.32 Friday.
   Among the utilities average's component issues, American
Electric Power gained 5/8 to 29 7/8, Columbia Gas System went
up 3/4 to 45 3/4, Commonwealth Edison rose 3/4 to 32 7/8,
Detroit Edison added 5/8 to 27 3/8 and Houston Industries
gained 1 to 33 1/4. Elsewhere in the sector, Dominion
Resources climbed 1 to 44 7/8, Northern States Power rose 3/4
to 36 5/8 and Pacific Enterprises added 5/8 to 44 1/4.
   A number of important technology stocks resumed their
recent advance following a pause Friday. International
Business Machines gained 7/8 to 120 3/8, Compaq Computer
soared 5 3/8 to 124 3/4, Hewlett-Packard gained 1 to 48 3/4
and Cray Research rose 1 7/8 to 50 3/8. But Digital Equipment
fell 1/4 to 91 1/2.
   Precious-metals stocks were left out of the market's rise
as the price of gold extended its recent retreat. Placer Dome
dropped 3/8 to 15, Homestake Mining dropped 3/8 to 18 1/8,
Battle Mountain Gold slid 3/8 to 12 1/8 and ASA Ltd. fell 1
1/2 to 46 1/8.
   Corroon &amp; Black tumbled 2 1/4 to 34 1/4 after agreeing to
merge with Willis Faber, a British insurance broker, in a
stock swap. The accord calls for the company's shareholders
to receive 7.8 common shares of Willis Faber for each of
their shares.
   Wal-Mart Stores climbed 2 1/4 to 60 5/8 on two million
shares. Chairman Sam M. Walton told the annual meeting he
believes the company could quintuple its sales to about $125
billion by the year 2000, while doubling the number of
Wal-Mart stores to about 3,000.
   Upjohn rose 3/4 to 40 7/8 on unusually heavy volume of 1.6
million shares. The company said no material news is pending,
but attributed the trading to an article in the latest issue
of Business Week that speculates Upjohn might be the next
pharmaceutical maker to strike a merger agreement. The
company is interested in "strategic alliances," a spokesman
said, but isn't particularly interested in being acquired.
   Tenneco rose 1 3/4 to 69 after the company's J.I. Case
unit reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto
Workers on a 40-month contract. Separately, a venture in
which Tenneco holds a 40% interest reached preliminary
contract agreements for a proposed gas pipeline linking
Canada and California.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich added 1/4 to 3 1/4. British
publisher Robert Maxwell told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report that he remains interested in a takeover of the
company, which has struggled with a heavy debt load since
recapitalizing in response to a bid from Mr. Maxwell in 1988.
   Sealed Air climbed 1 1/2 to 26 3/4. Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
repeated a buy recommendation on the stock after hosting a
meeting between the company's management and institutional
analysts.
   Russ Togs added 3/8 to 9 1/4. Industrial Equity (Pacific),
which has an 18.77% stake in the company, said it would
"strongly consider" providing financing for a management
buy-out.
   De Soto added 1 1/2 to 44 1/4. Shufro, Rose &amp; Ehrman said
it raised its stake in the company to 14.59%.
   Convex Computer dropped 3/4 to 18 1/8 after filing for an
offering of two million common shares. The company has about
18.8 million shares outstanding.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.57
to 364.40. Amex volume totaled 12,701,100 shares, compared
with 14,651,370 shares Friday. There were 319 issues
advancing, 280 declining and 219 were unchanged.
   Frederick's of Hollywood rose 1 1/8 to 18 1/2 following
the death of its founder and largest shareholder, Frederick
Mellinger, over the weekend.
   Met-Pro climbed 2 3/8 to 22 5/8. In an interview with
Barron's magazine, Stephen A. Lieber of Evergreen Limited
Market Fund selected the stock as his favorite.
   Cohu advanced 1 to 12 3/8. Charles Neuhauser, a
small-stock analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Baltimore,
told Barron's the stock is among his favorites. Others that
Mr. Neuhauser cited included two Big Board issues: Scotsman
Industries, which rose 1/4 to 8 5/8, and Park
Electrochemical, which added 7/8 to 15 1/4.
