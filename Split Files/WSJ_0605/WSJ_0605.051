   WARSAW -- If, as an Italian Communist Party leader once
said, "there are many roads to socialism," these days there
are at least as many roads back from it. All of them are full
of potholes and other pitfalls.
   Every country in East Europe has now embarked on such a
journey -- or is at least discussing what bags to pack. The
desired destination in each case is some nebulous mix of
democratic institutions, the alluring but confusing benefits
of capitalism, and the social safety net to which they've all
become accustomed during more than 40 years of Marxist
stagnation. They start, however, from very different stages
of political sophistication and economic development and have
significantly different chances of success.

   Recent travel in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland leads
to the perhaps surprising conclusion that it is Poland -- the
country starting from farthest behind and traveling the
rockiest road -- that stands the best chance of actually
making the transition to genuine capitalism. Poland already
has packed its bags and set off while its wealthier neighbors
are still planning their voyage.
   In any analysis of East Europe these days, one must set
aside East Germany. Though it shares the past miseries of
Marxism, it has a unique future as an integral part of an
enlarged German nation. At the other extreme, Bulgaria and
Romania, despite recent and enormous change, start from so
far back that they are destined to remain laggards. Thus, the
focus on problems and potential for Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland.
   Clearly there are commonalities. All three have the
burdensome legacy of ossified, uncompetitive economies. All
three have also been chained to the rigid Soviet economy. To
a degree generally overlooked by Americans, all three still
count the Soviets as their largest trading "partner." The
Lilliputians in this case remain tightly tied down by
Gulliver. There simply isn't any quick way out of dependency
on Soviet raw materials, nor an immediate alternative to the
Soviet market, which, unlike the West, is willing to barter
for frequently shoddy goods made by unmotivated workers in
antiquated factories.
   "We trade our stray dog for their blind cat," says Peter
Bod, a youthful, market-oriented economic adviser to
Hungary's new prime minister.
   The three countries also share officials mostly new to
government and overwhelmed by the challenge of creating
capitalism. A visit to the finance ministry in Czechoslovakia
is typical. "Czechoslovakia is a madhouse," says Dusan
Triska, a frantic, fortyish economist with an Einstein-like
coiffure. He is responsible for privatization programs. "We
are trying to do everything at once. New laws are being
introduced every day; we can't keep up with it all."
   All three countries covet German markets and money. Yet,
on the one hand, they fear it won't materialize as German
resources pour into East Germany; on the other hand, they
fear becoming German economic satellites.
   Also, to a degree that ought to concern Americans,
officials in all three countries are surprisingly reconciled
to the general irrelevance of America to their immediate
economic futures. They may look to America as a source of
inspiration, but they have reluctantly concluded that it
isn't going to supply much practical financial support. The
surprising thing to an American visitor is how infrequently
America is even mentioned in the offices or coffee houses of
Eastern Europe.
   If such similarities cut across all three ex-satellites,
there also are significant differences in atmospherics and
substance.
   Czechoslovakia, which statistically enjoys a per-capita
standard of living well beyond Poland's $1,100, still is so
desperate for foreign currency that all visitors are forced
upon arrival to exchange $16 for every day they will be in
the country. While Poland is coping with the consequences of
last January's sudden conversion to market, rather than
centrally administered, prices, Czechoslovakia's officials
continue to meet weekly to debate what economic reforms to
pursue. Its president seems more interested in making peace
between Arabs and Israelis than in resolving economic policy
disputes among his own ministers. Debate drags on in
government while Parliament busies itself changing street
names and discussing whether the name Czechoslovakia should
be hyphenated -- or whether Czechs and Slovaks should inhabit
the same nation at all.
   Some Czechs already are suggesting that perhaps socialist
economics, absent Soviet overlords, isn't so bad after all.
Since the Czechs have more to start with, they fear they have
more to lose. With a degree of comfort has come a higher
degree of complacency.
   The Czechs are searching for a route to risk-free
capitalism. For example, they continue to debate a national
voucher system whereby citizens each would receive a paper
"right" to buy equity in various state enterprises. Among the
problems with this paper privatization, however, is that
vouchers couldn't be freely traded, meaning that both
vouchers and enterprises will lack real market value. What
should happen to uneconomic enterprises in which no Czech
chooses to invest vouchers? "We can sell those to the
Japanese," says Mr. Triska.
   Vladimir Dlouhy, Czechoslovakia's new minister of
planning, who really would like to become the country's
minister of unplanning, sits in Prague's largest bastion of
bureaucracy, and says with a smile, "welcome to the heartbeat
of communist planning."
   Increasingly frustrated by political indecisiveness, Mr.
Dlouhy says, "We know what steps we have to take, but the
politicians aren't ready to take them." Optimists here
believe Czechoslovakia's direction will be set following
national elections Friday. But it's far from clear that much
will really change.
   At this point, Czechoslovakia, with its prewar industrial
base, its artistic and intellectual tradition and its
telegenic president, is quite clearly the world's darling.
But the world's darling risks ending up one of the world's
economic orphans if it continues to delay hard decisions.
   In Hungary's capital of Budapest a different kind of
disillusionment is setting in. Hungary over the last decade
managed to move significantly further toward a mix of Marxism
and market economics than any other state in East Europe. It
operated on a looser leash from Moscow, established more
trade with Western Europe, and built a reputation with
Western banks.
   Hungary is perplexed by several paradoxes. Precisely
because they managed to advance under communism, external
expectations these days are higher for the Hungarians.
Westerners arrive expecting a functioning market economy.
Hungary, however, was never a highly industrialized nation
and it never was willing or able genuinely to privatize its
economy. Hungarians are reluctant to yield elements of their
socialist safety net for the risks of greater economic
freedom.
   Frustrations exist in daily Hungarian life, like a
six-year wait to take title to an automobile. But the
frustrations aren't so great as to prompt strong public
demand for sharp change. The winners of this spring's
divisive election pledged to move the country
"compassionately" toward capitalism. The party promising more
economic pain en route decisively lost.
   "We've gone halfway on economic reform for 20 years and it
hasn't worked," says Ferenc Bartha, chairman of the Hungarian
National Bank.
   Indeed, if complacency is the problem in Czechoslovakia,
gradualism is the difficulty in Hungary. "I warn against the
philosophy of gradualism," says a senior executive of
Germany's Deutsche Bank. "Gradualism nourishes the illusion
you can avoid pain."
   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall recently sought to reassure
Western bankers who have financed Hungary's $20 billion
foreign debt. "Our mandate of election means we have the
moral trust to make the public accept hard decisions." But,
he added, "Harsh measures can be executed only in parallel
with the creation of a social safety net."
   It's not surprising that Hungarian officials want it both
ways. Genuine economic change would require harsh measures
for which there could be a political price. Any political
instability would scare off creditors and investors, leaving
Hungary bereft of external private support. One further
complication: Hungarians are engaged in divisive politics
over minorities in neighboring countries. To foreigners
looking in on East Europe, there are a number of distinct
countries with defined borders. But to many in East Europe,
there are rather a number of distinct nationalities who
transcend post-war borders. The issue of Romanian treatment
of Hungarian minorities dominates Hungarian politics more
than issues of socialism and capitalism.
   While the Czechs and Hungarians are seeking painless paths
to prosperity, the Poles are accepting genuine economic
sacrifice.
   In January, Poland's new Solidarity government launched
what it calls its "leap to the market." The government
slashed the budget, including a wide range of subsidies. It
tightened the money supply. It radically devalued the zloty.
It largely decontrolled prices, though not -- yet -- wages.
It encouraged foreign competition at the risk of bankrupting
state enterprises.
   The effects were predictably quick and traumatic. Costs of
such basic necessities as electricity rose by more than 300%
within a matter of weeks, and even the price of a bottle of
vodka doubled. Inflation soared -- to 80% in January -- but
has subsided since to roughly 5% a month. Wages, deindexed
from price increases, dropped sharply in real terms. Polish
unemployment rose to roughly 300,000 (still less than 2%) and
is predicted to rise to one million by year-end; by contrast,
the Hungarians fret about 4,000 jobless.
   As the money supply shrank, the monthly interest rate shot
to 40% in January -- though it, too, has since fallen to 8%
in April and 5.5% in May. The zloty was devalued 35% but the
result is a freely convertible currency that enables Poland's
economy to engage in internationally competitive commerce.
Indeed, few Poles any longer demand payment in dollars, as
the zloty is readily redeemable by any citizen at a local
bank for hard currency. Six months ago a hotel maitre d'
would chase down patrons offering to tear up the zloty
equivalent of a $50 dinner check in exchange for a $10 bill.
   The immediate downside of this high-stakes program has
been a significant decline in industrial production and fears
of a major recession. "We expected a drop of production,"
says Wojciech Misiag, deputy finance minister and an
architect of the economic reform plan. "Once you create a
real market, a lot of production here isn't salable; some
Polish products are too costly to produce." Industrial
production fell 30% in January and February but has
stabilized, and Mr. Misiag believes the downward trend is
reversing.
   The signs of robust commerce on Warsaw's main streets seem
to support Mr. Misiag's optimism. If some old enterprises are
foundering in the newly competitive marketplace, new
entrepreneurial activity is flourishing. This city now teems
with sidewalk sellers offering everything from formerly
unattainable fresh fruit to fashionable Italian footwear.
   Typical is Jan Kulibab, a sidewalk shoe salesman, peddling
his total inventory of two dozen pairs of Italian shoes from
behind a table on a Warsaw street corner. Mr. Kulibab is
selling the shoes for $19 a pair; he buys them at $16 a pair
from a wholesaler who travels back and forth by bus to
Germany, where he buys the shoes for $12 a pair. Mr. Kulibab,
however, doesn't intend to remain a sidewalk shoe salesman.
His ambition is to save enough zlotys to rent a vacant
sausage shop where he can display a wider range of shoes and
undercut the shoddy merchandise at the state-owned department
store down the street. "Last month I made an 800,000 zloty
profit {about $80} but with a shop I could do much better,"
he says.
   In addition to the enterprise of its Kulibabs, Poland also
benefits from a degree of political unity still unknown
elsewhere in East Europe. In Hungary and Czechoslovakia --
and even more so in Romania and Bulgaria -- the "new"
political leadership consists of at best a handful of former
opposition politicians who sit atop layer upon layer of
politicians and bureaucrats, who may have changed their party
affiliation but not necessarily their Marxist mentality. In
the rest of East Europe political reformation runs only skin
deep. But in Poland there is genuine political revolution.
   That revolution, of course, has been under way for nearly
a decade -- since Lech Walesa and his Solidarity movement
first challenged the monolithic power of the Polish Communist
Party. Here the pressure for political change has come from
below -- from shipyard workers rather than playwrights.
   Skeptics, and there are many, still argue that there is
little in Poland's long history of division to justify much
optimism about transition to long-term democracy and
prosperity. But the facts support some optimism. Few
outsiders believed back in the dark days of martial law
suppression of Solidarity that the movement could rise again
to challenge communist control. More recently, many doubted
whether the Solidarity government would have the guts to take
what amounts to a free fall into market economics. In each
case, Poles confounded skeptics.
   With all they've been through, Poles are not dreamers
about the future, but neither are they whiners or worriers
about the present. The clear impression is that they have
resolutely embarked on a rocky road back from communism and
that they mean to see the journey through.
