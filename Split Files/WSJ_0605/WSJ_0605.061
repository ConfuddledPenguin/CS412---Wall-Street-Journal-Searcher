   Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., president of the Hudson
Institute, in a commencement speech May 19 at the University
of Indianapolis:

   Now, every commencement should include at least one piece

children -- lots of them. . . . They are your wager on the
future, your gift to society, and the most useful, fulfilling
graduate course you will ever take.
