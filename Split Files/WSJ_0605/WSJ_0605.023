   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence was essentially unchanged
in May, as the index compiled by the Conference Board
declined to 106.7 from April's revised 107.3.
   The monthly survey, conducted for the Board by National
Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, found consumers slightly
less positive about conditions in May, but buying plans
perked up a bit. The survey uses the year 1985 as a base of
100 points and covers 5,000 households throughout the U.S.

   Appraisal of current business conditions and availability
of jobs are slightly less positive than in April, and the
outlook for the next six months is almost the same as April.
About 23% say business conditions are "good," and close to
20% say they are "bad." More than 18% expect improvement but
10% fear conditions will be worse.
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference
Board's Consumer Research Center, said "although consumer
confidence has been running well below the levels registered
late last year, there is still no indication that the economy
is moving into recession." The consumer-confidence index for
May 1990 trails May 1989 by 10 points.
   The report showed slight improvements in home-buying
plans, with 3.9% planning to buy a home within the next six
months, up from 2.9% in April. Those with car-buying plans
rose to 8.2% from 6.2%. However, those planning to buy major
appliances fell to 29.3% in May from 31.3% in April.
