   SEATTLE -- Two electronic banking networks in the Pacific
Northwest, the Exchange and Accel, said they agreed to merge
by the end of the year.
   The merger would create a network of 2,892 automated
teller machines, or ATMs, in Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Montana, Alaska and Canada's western provinces,
representatives for the networks said. The details of the
merger will be worked out over the next 120 days, they said.
