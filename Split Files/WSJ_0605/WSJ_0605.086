   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s computer unit
unveiled two dozen products, including powerful Unix
software-based servers, personal computers and upgrades to
its existing products.
   Chief among the new products are so-called server systems,
which coordinate the flow of data and storage of information
on a network of personal computers. One, called the
StarServer E, uses the i486 microprocessor made by Intel
Corp. The other server is a fault-tolerant machine designed
by Cupertino, Calif.-based Tandem Computers Inc. and New
York-based AT&amp;T and is built by Tandem.

   The StarServer E, which AT&amp;T will begin shipping next
month, is designed to use between one and four computer
processors. System performance starts at 25 million
instructions per second with one processor and increases by
25% each time a new processor is added for a total 106 MIPS,
according to AT&amp;T. The system's i486 chip runs one-third
faster than other i486 chips now in use.
   "No other machine in the market has that kind of
performance," said Richard A. McGuinn, president of AT&amp;T
Computer Systems. "It's hot." However, competitors such as
Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, and netFRAME Systems Inc.,
Milpitas, Calif., offer competing servers using Intel's 486.
But neither use the Unix software operating system designed
by AT&amp;T.
   "The Unix market is a little overcrowded right now," said
Enzo Torresi, netFRAME's president. "We're taking a different
approach, using Netware software, but by first quarter of
1991 we'll introduce a Unix-based system." Netware is a
competing software made by Novell Inc., Provo, Utah.
   The fault-tolerant machine, which AT&amp;T said is available
for shipments now, is designed for telecommunications and
other applications such as financial transaction services
that cannot afford a computer system failure. The Tandem
machine will diagnose itself when it has a problem,
automatically call a service center and the center will send
out a replacement part, which Mr. McGuinn said can be snapped
into place by "even a clerk."
   AT&amp;T made its product announcement at the COMDEX/Spring
'90 computer show in Atlanta. It said it would build the
StarServer E at its Little Rock, Ark., plant, which recently
began volume production of the personal computer that AT&amp;T
designed with Intel.
   AT&amp;T also unveiled new versions of its 6386 personal
computer and upgrades for its 3B2 line of minicomputers. One
6386 model can be upgraded to an i486-based system without
having to buy a new PC. Another unit, called the 6386SX, can
be bought without a disk and is used in large networks
controlled by server systems. The 3B2 upgrades include
enhanced Unix software and improved data-networking
functions.
   Rikki Kirzner, senior industry analyst at market
researcher Dataquest Inc., said AT&amp;T's new products "by
themselves are OK. They're nice middle-of-the-road
competitive products." What's impressive, she said, is how
they fit well with AT&amp;T's strategy to be a systems
integrator.
   "AT&amp;T wants to be the womb-to-tomb supplier in computer
systems just like they are in phone systems," she said. If
you look at the company's products and partnerships over the
last year, you're starting to see a very strong set of
{products} emerging."
