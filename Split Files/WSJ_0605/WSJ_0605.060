   LOS ANGELES -- Medco Research Inc. said a shareholder
lawsuit filed against the company and its former director of
research and medical affairs was dismissed without prejudice
by the plaintiffs.
   The complaint had alleged that the former executive, Dr.
William C. Govier, had violated securities law when he sold
stock in the company in March, prior to the public
announcement in April that several prospective buyers weren't
interested in the company. Last month, Medco fired Dr.
Govier, but wouldn't say whether his dismissal was related to
the suit.
