   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson &amp; Johnson said it
established its Ortho Biotech unit as a separate operating
subsidiary.
   Ortho Biotech, a biotechnology company, has been a
division of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.
subsidiary. Among its products, Ortho Biotech markets a
monoclonal antibody treatment used to reverse acute kidney
transplant rejection. And through a Johnson &amp; Johnson
affiliate it markets an anti-anemia drug for patients
experiencing anemia due to chronic renal failure.

   Ortho Biotech, based in Raritan, N.J., was set up in 1986.
A Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman said the company shifts
businesses to separate operations when they reach a
sufficient size to benefit from decentralization and
specialization.
