   Rumors of Mr. Maxwell's interest in a U.S. daily newspaper
have circulated in recent months. However, yesterday was the
first time he acknowledged that he is actively seeking a U.S.
paper.
   Industry executives say Mr. Maxwell has focused his
interest on the Chicago Sun-Times, the country's 11th largest
newspaper with daily circulation of 532,678. Mr. Maxwell said
yesterday he "wouldn't deny or confirm" that he is
negotiating for the Sun-Times.
   The Sun-Times is currently owned by an investment group
led by the New York investment firm of Adler &amp; Shaykin, which
bought the newspaper from Rupert Murdoch in 1986 for $145
million. Sun-Times Chairman Leonard P. Shaykin, a managing
partner of Adler &amp; Shaykin, said "we aren't in discussion
with Maxwell about the purchase of the Sun-Times." Mr.
Shaykin wouldn't comment on whether previous negotiations had
taken place.
   Mr. Maxwell also acknowledged he is interested in Tribune
Co.'s New York Daily News, currently in tough contract
negotiations with its union. Although Tribune executives say
it isn't for sale, Mr. Maxwell said yesterday, "We would be
very interested in the Daily News if the deadlock becomes
impossible. We would be a very competent party to buy it, as
a way out for the Tribune."
