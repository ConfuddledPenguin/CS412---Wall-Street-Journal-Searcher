   Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., said it is recalling
2,700 1991-model, four-door Ford Explorer sport utility
vehicles to replace faulty sunroof hinges.
   The auto maker said the hinges may misalign when owners
reinstall the removable sunroof glass. As a result, Ford
said, the sunroof may come off while the vehicles are being
driven. The company said it has received four reports of
sunroofs detaching, but has no reports of injuries.
