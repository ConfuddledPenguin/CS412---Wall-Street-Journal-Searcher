   CALGARY, Alberta -- Nova Corp. of Alberta said it agreed
to sell its valve-making subsidiary, Grove Italia S.p.A., to
an affiliate of one of Italy's biggest banks, for 121 billion
lire (US$96.8 million).
   The planned sale, to an investment group one-third owned
by Sanpaolo Finance S.p.A., a unit of Instituto Bancario San
Paolo di Torino, is expected to generate a net gain to Nova
of about 30 million Canadian dollars (US$25.6 million), or 10
cents a share. Nova had first-quarter net income of C$36
million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of C$1.2 billion.

   The sale, the second announced by Nova in the past two
weeks, was greeted with enthusiasm by investors. In heavy
Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Nova closed at
C$9.125, up 50 cents on volume of about 6.8 million shares.
   Nova announced late last month a pact to sell its rubber
operations to Bayer AG of West Germany, for C$1.25 billion.
Proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce Nova's
long-term non-utility debt, which swelled with its C$1.3
billion purchase of Polysar Energy &amp; Chemical Corp. in 1988.
   Nova, which has interests in pipelines, oil and gas, and
petrochemicals, expects long-term debt from its unregulated
businesses to fall to C$450 million to C$500 million once the
transactions are completed, down from C$2.01 billion at March
31. The shrunken debt figure includes the impact of debt and
other liabilities to be assumed by Bayer.
   "Nova would be very well capitalized" once the
transactions are completed, "and in a good position to grow
its polyethylene business" when prices for that commodity
rebound, said John McKimm, an analyst in Toronto with
Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.
   Grove Italia is one of four non-core units that Nova put
up for sale nearly a year ago. It estimated the value of the
group at C$500 million. A spokesman said Nova is continuing
to pursue the sale of the other units, though he didn't offer
details.
