   MINNEAPOLIS -- MEI Diversified Inc. said it completed the
sale of its candy and snack group to Ezaki Glico Co. of
Osaka, Japan, for $58 million.
   MEI previously said the sale of the business, which had
1989 sales of $107 million, marks the company's planned
departure from the candy and snack business. The sale won't
result in a gain because the purchase price approximates the
book value of the assets sold.
