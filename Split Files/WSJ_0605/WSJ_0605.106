   A group led by New York money manager Julian H. Robertson
Jr. lifted its stake in Isomedix Inc. to 7.9%, but the
company said the increase was only an investment.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group
disclosed that it holds 510,000 shares of the Whippany, N.J.,
provider of sterilization services. The holding includes
95,000 shares purchased April 12 to May 17 for $10.75 to
$11.87 apiece.

   John Masefield, chairman, president and chief executive

"take three-{year} to five-year positions in companies they
like," Mr. Masefield said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Isomedix
shares rose 25 cents to $12.375.
   For 1990's first quarter, Isomedix reported earnings rose
35% to $968,997, or 15 cents a share, from $714,361 or 14
cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Average shares
outstanding rose 29% to 6.7 million. Sales advanced 21% to
