   May was a good month for the stock market, but the gain
chalked up by four investment pros in this column's
stock-picking contest was even better.
   While the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.3% for the
month, the contestants' picks gained 11%, on average. That
was a couple of percentage points better than the 8.9% gain
on four stocks picked by a toss of darts at the New York
Stock Exchange listings. As a result, the pros notched their
fourth consecutive victory over the darts, and their 15th in
20 outings.

   Lawrence Cisneros, president of San Juan Asset Management
Inc. in Huntington Beach, Calif., was the month's big winner.
His May selection turned out to be right on the mark: Service
Corp. International, a funeral-home and cemetery chain, rose
nearly 17%.
   For the next one to six months, Mr. Cisneros recommends
Dexter Corp., a specialty-chemicals producer in Windsor
Locks, Conn. He likes the way the company picks its niches,
and thinks it has been wise to deemphasize commodity
chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride in order to concentrate
on items with higher profit margins. Among its products are
powders used in making computer chips, and special paint for
airplanes. Dexter also has interests in electronics, food
packaging and medical research.
   The stock isn't high-priced compared with the company's
earnings. It closed yesterday at $23.875 a share, and
earnings last year were $1.73 per share. (This year, analysts
look for earnings of about $1.85.) So the shares are selling
at about 13 times earnings -- below average in today's pricey
market.
   Dexter owns 62% of Life Technologies Inc., a biotechnology
and cancer-research firm. Including this stake, Mr. Cisneros
reckons that Dexter's "breakup value" (the total price the
company would bring if its various operations were broken up
and sold off) is around $50 a share. He would buy at any
price to a maximum $28, which is the stock's 52-week high.
   Small-stock advocate Jonathan Steinberg won the contest in
March and April. The publisher of Individual Investor
magazine trailed in the one-month derby this time. But he
picked the biggest winner of the past six months, earning
himself a fourth consecutive appearance. In March, he
recommended American Film Technologies Inc., a leader in the
business of converting black-and-white films into color
films. The stock was selling then for $6 a share. By the end
of May, it had moved up to $11.25, for an 87% gain.
   Mr. Steinberg's latest pick is Financial News Network
Inc., which he says appears "to have beaten back {the}
attack" by rival cable network CNBC. "They are doing very
well in a sluggish advertising environment and a downturn for
the securities industry," he says.
   For the nine months ended in March, Financial News Network
earned $4.7 million, up from $1.9 million in the year-earlier
period. "They are plowing their money back into upgrading the
programming," says Mr. Steinberg. "They will be one of the
leading disseminators of business information into the next
century."
   FNN traded in the national over-the-counter market
yesterday at $9.125 a share. That's about 24 times the past
12 months' earnings, adjusted for certain statistical quirks.
Mr. Steinberg says he'd buy the shares at prices to a maximum
of $10.75.
   Two new players join the fun this month. Alan Bond is
equity portfolio manager at W.R. Lazard &amp; Co. in New York.
Heiko Thieme is manager of the American Heritage Fund and a
consulting strategist for Deutsche Bank of West Germany.
   Mr. Bond plumps for Syntex Corp., which he says is
successfully making the transition "from a single-product
company {Saprosyn, an anti-arthritis drug} to a diversified
drug company." He has high hopes for several products Syntex
expects to introduce soon, especially Ticlid, an anti-stroke
drug, and Synarel, a drug to treat endometriosis. And he's
impressed with Syntex's strong return on equity (about 40%).
   Earnings growth at Syntex has been about 15% a year, but
Mr. Bond thinks it may accelerate to as much as 20% through
1993. He would pay a maximum $65 a share for the stock, which
closed yesterday at $58.50. Mr. Thieme picks Citicorp, which
"nobody wants" because of the banking industry's problems
with real-estate loans and loans to third-world countries.
   Interest rates aren't helping much either. They're still
higher than banks would like. (Low rates help banks maintain
a wide percentage spread between the rates they pay on
deposits and the rates they charge on loans.) But Mr. Thieme
thinks rates (currently 8.6% on long-term Treasury bills)
will ease to 8% or less by year end.
   Anyway, the industry's troubles are fully reflected in
Citicorp's "beaten-down" stock price, Mr. Thieme says.
Yesterday's price was $24.625 a share; he says he'd buy the
stock at prices to a maximum $26. "On a six-month basis, I
have very little doubt that it could be a $30 stock."
   "The {dividend} yield of 7.7% shows that the management of
{Chairman and Chief Executive Officer} John Reed has
confidence in the outlook," Mr. Thieme says. "I share his
confidence."
   For June, the pros' selections are up against a dartboard
portfolio consisting of Callahan Mining Corp., Knogo Corp.,
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. and Sonat Inc.
