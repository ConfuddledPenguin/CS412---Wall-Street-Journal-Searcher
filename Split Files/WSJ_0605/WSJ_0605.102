   Boise Cascade Corp., Boise, Idaho, said that nonrecurring
operating problems at four of its pulp and paper mills will
depress second-quarter earnings by about $15 million before
taxes, or 20 cents a share on a fully diluted basis. Analysts
had estimated earlier that the forest-products company's
second-quarter results would be flat or even slightly down
from the first quarter of 1990, when the company reported
fully diluted earnings of 73 cents a share.
   Unanticipated complications with maintenance and repair at
several of its pulp and paper mills led to lost production
time and higher costs, a company spokesman said. The mills
are located in Maine, Washington, Louisiana and Alabama.
