   COMARCO Inc. (Anaheim, Calif.) -- Harrison Young II, 46
years old, said he resigned as president and chief executive
officer of this computer products and services company to
rejoin his family in Virginia. Mr. Young worked full-time at
Comarco's offices here since assuming the president post in
the wake of the company's financial problems nearly three
years ago. Mr. Young oversaw Comarco's return to
profitability and debt reduction program. Comarco said it has
begun a nationwide search for a new chief executive. Don M.
Bailey, 44, senior vice president, will assume Mr. Young's
duties until a permanent successor is named.
