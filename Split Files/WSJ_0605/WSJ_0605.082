   Shelby Williams Industries Inc. said it expects earnings
in its second quarter ending June 30 to be lower than the
year earlier's record $1.9 million, or 20 cents a share.
   Manfred Steinfeld, chairman and chief executive officer,
said order rates for the Chicago-based company's seats used
in restaurants and other businesses have slowed sharply in
recent weeks.

   Mr. Steinfeld said earnings may be closer to this year's
first-quarter results than the year-ago second-quarter
record. In the first quarter, net income was $910,000, or 10
cents a share, on sales of $40,961,000.
