   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to delay new oil
drilling off the coasts of California and Florida so that
additional environmental studies can be done, administration
officials said.
   While cautioning that the president hadn't made a final
decision, the officials said he was likely to seek different
delays for various tracts. Some parts of Florida were likely
to be removed even from consideration for development until
early in the next century.

   The long-awaited announcement, which is expected next
week, will try to steer a middle course between
environmentalists, who have pushed for a permanent ban, and
the oil industry, which is eager to resume drilling.
   By delaying a decision, the president could remove some of
the political heat from the issue in the fall election
campaign. The Florida congressional delegation and GOP
gubernatorial candidates Sen. Pete Wilson in California and
Gov. Bob Martinez in Florida all oppose new drilling.
   In his public comments, the president has hinted that he
won't allow drilling in the foreseeable future off Florida
but has left California's fate more murky.
   Lisa Speer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council in New York, said, "A delay would have been a bold
stroke before the Exxon Valdez. But people aren't going to be
satisfied with it at this point."
