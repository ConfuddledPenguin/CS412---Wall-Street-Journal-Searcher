   Bloomfield Hills, Mich. -- The hanging of the May Queen
and her attendants has brought much joy to the Cranbrook
Educational Community. It took a cherry picker, two 25-foot
ladders and a crew of strong men to string them up, but the
results were more than satisfying. Crime in the Midwest? No,
for the suspended females are the central figures in a woven
hanging designed by Loja and Eliel Saarinen and made by
Studio Loja Saarinen for the opening of Kingswood, the
secondary girls' school at Cranbrook, in 1932.
   "The Festival of the Queen of the May," a 16-by-18-foot
textile masterwork, has been the focal point of the dining
hall at Kingswood ever since, but the years had not been kind
to it. It desperately needed to be cleaned and to have its
fabric strengthened and repaired. The task was, for the world
of textile restoration, a major event, and by anybody's
standards, it was a huge, intricate, expensive and sometimes
filthy job.

   The hanging has recently returned from an eight-month
sojourn in the Rochester, N.Y., conservation studio of Paul
Czubay, where more than a thousand hours were spent in its
cleaning and repair. To see it fresh and clean was a
wonderful thing, and for me, a kind of ratification of the
value of growing up.
   Like most of the girls who ate lunch with the May Queen
during their teen-age years (I was a student at Kingswood in
the 1950s), I knew that Loja Saarinen was one of the foremost
fiber artists of her day and that the hanging was among her
studio's most important works, but until I viewed the newly
cleaned hanging, it was little more than a memory of figures,
pink triangles and especially shoes. We envied the brocaded
figures because they got to wear heels, while school rules
shod us in sensible oxfords. So much for teen-age art
appreciation.
   There certainly was ample opportunity to appreciate art,
architecture and design at Cranbrook, for this complex of
suburban Detroit schools was begun in 1925 by the newspaper
publisher George G. Booth and the expatriate Finnish
architect Eliel Saarinen as a combination of school, atelier
and art colony. Every rug, curtain, chair, lamp and dish in
the Saarinen school buildings was designed at Cranbrook, and
most were made there. From these beginnings there developed
the Cranbrook Academy of Art, whose alumni include Charles
and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Jack Lenor Larsen and many
other noted designers, architects, weavers, painters,
sculptors and ceramicists.
   But creation is one thing, and care is another. For almost
half a century Cranbrook had neither the awareness nor the
funding to do much about the conservation needs of its art
objects. The May Queen, meanwhile, absorbed dirt like a
furnace filter (a table from which hot meals were served was
directly below the hanging), faded from exposure to
ultraviolet light, and suffered the indignity of being hit at
the lower border by a tomato. The turning point in awareness
came in the early 1980s, with a major exhibition about
Cranbrook from 1925 to 1950 at the Detroit Institute of Art
and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The turning
point in funding came in 1985 when the Evening News
Association was sold, and Cranbrook's holdings of what had
been a closely held and sleepy stock brought a jump in
endowment of $45 million. Art Academy President Roy Slade,
Curator of Collections Gregory Wittkopp, and Registrar Karen
Serota soon began implementing a comprehensive conservation
plan for all the Cranbrook institutions, funded by endowment
and by alumni contributions.
   All this activity was great news for the May Queen. Her
turn for conservation came in March 1989, when some $17,000
(raised by Kingswood alumnae) was set aside for her
treatment. Seven candidates vied for the project, and the
winner was Mr. Czubay, a professional conservator who
specializes in carpets and in woven objects made of
combinations of natural and early synthetic dyes. In his
usual working garb of white shirt, mod khaki pants, round
glasses and yellow Converse hi-tops, the curly headed fellow
looks about 25, though he's 39. At about 6 1/2 feet, he's
probably the world's tallest textile conservator, though
height is hardly his sole distinction (still, it helps to be
tall when you're working with a piece the size of the May
Queen). A prize-winning weaver who has worked professionally
in textile design, he also has done graduate study in polymer
chemistry, fiber structure and dye technology.
   For the past several years, in cooperation with Mary
Ballard, senior textile conservator at the Smithsonian's
Conservation Analytical Labs, Mr. Czubay has developed new
techniques in the matching and documenting of color, using a
Minolta Chromometer, so the first thing that happened to the
May Queen on arrival in Rochester was a measuring,
photographing, and mapping of the 73 colors in the piece.
After vacuuming (through a screen) to remove the loose dirt,
which took a week, the process of color measurement was
repeated, with dramatically different results.
   Now the real fun began. "The Festival of the Queen of the
May" is made of linen, wool and unknown synthetic fibers
colored with equally unknown synthetic dyes. So Mr. Czubay
had to test extensively for color-fastness and fiber
composition before the Queen could have her sponge bath. It
took 750 gallons of laboratory-grade, deionized water and
1,800 sheets of blotting paper to wash the hanging in an
18-hour marathon session. Mr. Czubay and his assistant, Wini
Steiner, had to keep the entire piece wet for the whole time
so that there wouldn't be watermarks. While they sponged and
blotted, two other assistants brought in detergent solution
and water and piled the blotting paper in the other room. By
bath's end, the pile of discarded blotting paper measured 20
feet by 6 feet and was 4 feet deep. The hanging was allowed
to dry, and then Mr. Czubay took color measurements again,
both to document the differences made by the bath and to
provide a baseline so that it will be a simple matter in the
future to monitor the hanging and see how fast it is fading
or getting dirty.
   Mr. Czubay spent the next six months in surgical gloves,
repairing and relining the tapestry. First he identified all
the deteriorated threads in the linen foundation and rewove
them one by one. Then he had to invent a method for backing
the hanging with cotton muslin. The May Queen is unlike most
tapestries in that it contains many different weights of
textiles, each with its own stretch factor and tensile
strength. To get some idea of the problems Mr. Czubay faced,
imagine bringing uniformity to a roof composed partly of
brick, partly of granite and partly of clay and wattles. He
finally lined up the hanging and the backing flat on the
ground, built a bridge on wheels across the hanging, and
spent three weeks sewing while kneeling with his head lower
than his knees. He and Ms. Steiner would stitch for 15
minutes at a time, using curved surgical needles and 20-foot
pieces of thread that could be adjusted individually as
needed. Then they attached Velcro to the top, hoisted the May
Queen to the ceiling, and let it hang for a week. Two of the
May Queen's attendants drooped, but Mr. Czubay and Ms.
Steiner pulled threads like super-delicate puppeteers and
evened them up. Then, for two months, they removed stitching
from the netted portions and then added stitching to the
brocading, passing a needle back and forth with the hanging
between them.
   During those two months, Mr. Czubay says, he and Ms.
Steiner spent a fair amount of time perched on ladders, and
he envied the physical stamina and discipline that Ms.
Steiner's background as a dancer gave her. She is a Juilliard
graduate who once worked in the corps de ballet at Radio City
Music Hall. An injury meant a new career in embroidery, and
she developed a high level of accomplishment in her new field
while working to create liturgical textiles for synagogues.
Ms. Steiner (like Mr. Czubay) also is known for being
close-mouthed, which is important when valuable pieces such
as the May Queen are in the conservation studio. Nobody knew
that the May Queen had been to Rochester until after the
hanging had returned to Michigan.
   The final problem was hanging the hanging. Because most of
its weight was in the bottom third, the May Queen had been
like a large-hipped woman hanging by her thumbs. Mr. Czubay's
job here amounted to putting a chair under her feet. He
devised a complex system of adjustable twill tapes and Velcro
strips that allowed him to hang the May Queen without putting
further stress on its fibers. Thus equipped, the May Queen
came home to Kingswood to reign in the dining hall, looking
far more glorious than anybody remembered. So many colors and
forms have been revealed by cleaning that you hardly notice
the shoes.
