   DENVER -- Amdura Corp. said it signed a definitive
agreement to sell its Coast to Coast Stores Inc. unit to
Servistar for an estimated $75 million.
   Amdura, a hardware distributor that is operating under
federal bankruptcy-law proceedings, said the transaction is
subject to various conditions and bankruptcy court approval.
It said the purchase price will depend on the value of the
assets at closing.
