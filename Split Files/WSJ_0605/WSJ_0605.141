   WASHINGTON -- The self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter market is considering a plan to require
securities brokers to requalify by examination every three
years.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is calling
for public comment on the plan, which would exempt brokers
who already are registered when the program begins.

   "We don't envision this as a back-to-the-basics exam,"
said Ronald E. Buesinger, vice chairman of the NASD and
director of the securities firm A.G. Edwards Inc.'s division
that handles personnel and training. "This is kind of an
update test, focusing on new" rules, regulations, securities
products and tax laws.
   NASD has been working on the plan with the North American
Securities Administrators Association, which includes the
securities agencies of all 50 states. And the states have
been cracking down on incompetence and wrongdoing in the
securities field, particularly in the penny-stock industry.
   Lee Polson, executive director of the administrators
group, said that the states "have been increasingly
requiring" professionals "to demonstrate professional
competence." He says, "If it's good for the doctors and
lawyers, why isn't it good for the . . . broker-dealers" as
well.
   He noted that a number of states were developing their own
requirements specifically for the securities industry. "It
would be better to have a single across-the-board proposal,"
allowing for more-uniform measurement of competence, Mr.
Polson said.
   The plan proposes that if a broker fails a recertification
test four consecutive times, the broker's registration would
be revoked and he or she would have to pass the required
entry-level exams for new brokers.
   Mr. Buesinger said comments will be taken for 60 days. If
the NASD board and Securities and Exchange Commission approve
the plan, the agency hopes to implement the plan beginning
Jan. 1, 1991, he said. If that happens, the first exam would
be administered in calendar year 1993, he said.
