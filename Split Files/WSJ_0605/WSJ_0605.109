   Trans World Music Corp., Albany, N.Y., settled a
trademark-infringement suit brought by rival record and tape
retailer Peaches Entertainment Corp. for $1.5 million.
   Trans World, which has been rapidly expanding its chain of
outlets, had taken a $2.5 million charge against earnings in
the first quarter of 1989 to cover the original $2 million
judgment in Peaches' favor and related expenses. Peaches is
based in Hialeah Gardens, Fla.

   However, Albany-based Trans World appealed the court
decision and late Friday the two companies settled for $1.5
million. Trans World expects the adjustment to boost its
second-quarter earnings by about $300,000 or three cents per
share.
   Meanwhile, at Trans World's annual meeting on Friday,
Chairman Robert J. Higgins predicted that the company's net
income in 1990 could top $18 million or about $2 per share, a
35% increase over 1989's $13.3 million or $1.48 per share,
and that revenues could hit $400 million, about a 28% rise
over 1989's $313 million.
