   INTERNATIONAL PAPER Co. (Purchase, N.Y.) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it affirmed its single-A-minus senior debt
rating and triple-B-plus subordinated debt rating for this
paper and wood products company. The ratings affect about $2
billion of debt. S&amp;P noted that the company's core commodity
products "are experiencing their strongest markets in nearly
a decade." Future acquisitions are likely to involve both
debt and equity and capital structure shouldn't materially
change, S&amp;P said.

   PNC FINANCIAL Corp. (Pittsburgh) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. lowered the debt ratings of this bank holding
company, reflecting continued concern over its asset quality.
Moody's lowered PNC's subordinated debt rating to single-A-2
from double-A-3, and it also downgraded the ratings of PNC's
large-bank affiliates for their long-term deposits. Moody's
cited "the likelihood of further asset quality deterioration,
related to PNC's exposure to real estate and highly leveraged
transactions, as well as expected pressure on profitability
and possible moderation of PNC's currently strong equity
capitalization."
