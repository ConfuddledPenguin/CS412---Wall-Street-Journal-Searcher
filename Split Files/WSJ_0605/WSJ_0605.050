   CHICAGO -- The nation's retailers continue to lose the war
against shoplifting, which is the fastest-growing larceny
crime and now amounts to a $9 billion-a-year problem.
   To try to turn the tide, several of this city's biggest
retailers have gone to unusual lengths to corral shoplifting
pros. For two years, they bankrolled a suburban thrift shop
as a front. Five Cook County sheriff's deputies played store
clerks to legitimate customers in the front of the J&amp;O
Clothing store while acting as "fences" for stolen apparel in
the back office.

   The undercover cops paid top dollar for Perry Ellis suits,
Liz Claiborne dresses and other designer clothes snitched
from the stores by professional shoplifters. And they
videotaped the illicit deals with a hidden camera.
   Now the sheriff's department is seeking indictments
against 36 people suspected of shoplifting merchandise worth
$152,000 from familiar stores like Marshall Field's,
Neiman-Marcus, Lord &amp; Taylor and Carson Pirie Scott. Those
stores, along with Evans Inc., a fur-and-clothing-store
chain, put up the initial cash for the operation.
   The retailers consider the "sting" operation a success and
expect it to be tried elsewhere in the country. But it's much
too early to claim victory. If the past is any guide, few of
the accused shoplifters will get the maximum five-year
sentence, or any jail term at all. Since jails already are
crowded with more dangerous criminals, many shoplifters get
probation -- and resume their lives of crime.
   Professional thieves these days thwart anti-theft tags by
stuffing merchandise into bags lined with aluminum foil. Or
they smuggle untagged goods out in oversized girdles.
Closed-circuit TV cameras don't stop them either. Even hiding
store security guards in portable pillars with two-way
mirrors, called Trojan Horses, hasn't prevented shoplifting
from escalating.
   "The only thing that can prevent {shoplifters} from coming
back is if they croak," declares Mary Mattimore, loss
prevention manager at Marshall Field's biggest store.
   The Chicago retailers, nevertheless, say the sting helped
them identify the city's most active thieves. The retailers
intend to post pictures of convicted shoplifters in their
store offices, alerting security people to toss them out.
   Still, the operation started with agonizing slowness.
After the store opened in August 1988, two months passed
before the deputies made their first buy from a thief -- a
brown mink jacket.
   For more than a year, the deputies primarily were
salesclerks, serving a mix of factory and office workers,
travel agents and young mothers who stopped by the shabby
$1,000-a-month storefront tucked between a travel agency and
a Baptist church in the suburb of Niles just north of
Chicago.
   In a typical month, the undercover police waited on just
15 or 20 legitimate customers and collected only about $800
in sales. Hours -- sometimes days -- passed without any
visitors at all. Last July, the deputies rang up a pitiful
$77.16 in sales. They passed the time sipping soft drinks and
watching everything from Geraldo Rivera to the Flintstones on
a small black-and-white television set.
   Some of the retailers started to worry. Burnett Donoho,
president of Marshall Field's, turned to Lewis Shealy, his
head of loss prevention and the architect of the plan, one
day last year and asked: "Did we buy a pig in a poke here?"
   The big hurdle proved to be getting the word out to
shoplifters. William Maloney, the deputy who supervised the
operation for the sheriff, was willing to pay 30% of the
ticketed price for stolen clothes -- a premium over the going
rate of 25 cents on the dollar paid by other fences. He
couldn't exactly advertise. Instead, he paid informants $100
or $150 to tell their friends.
   Marshall Field's security people tried to help by
suggesting to suspected shoplifters that J&amp;O was in the
fencing business. While interrogating suspects in store
detention rooms, they would pick up a J&amp;O business card from
the floor and ask: "Did this drop out of your pocket? Is this
your fence?"
   Shoplifters finally started favoring J&amp;O during last
year's Christmas season. The break came after an undercover
cop was assigned to spread the word about J&amp;O's fencing
operation. Thieves started offering the deputies clothes from
more stores.
   On March 26, a well-dressed woman who called herself
"Urina" strolled in with the operation's largest haul -- nine
men's suits ranging in price from $680 to $825 and nine
women's outfits priced from $236 to $315. The suits came from
Marshall Field's and the women's outfits from Lord &amp; Taylor.
One of the deputies handed her $2,735 in cash. Another,
hiding in a narrow hallway behind the office with a shotgun
at his side, videotaped the deal through a hole in a pegboard
on the wall.
   "Urina" also spread the word about J&amp;O, telling a woman
who called herself "GiGi." She showed up one recent
afternoon, wearing a heart-shaped stud through her nose and a
short-sleeve blouse that revealed a tattoo on her right arm.
Her haul: three Liz Claiborne dresses from Carson Pirie. "I
think I'm going to ease around to the men's department," she
told the deputies. "I'm going to call y'all as soon as I get
finished." After collecting $110 in cash, she added: "I want
you to know: I am a thief."
   With the shop's illicit business picking up this spring,
the retailers decided to wrap up the operation. By then, many
of the stores -- which anted up a total of $17,500 at the
outset and supplemented it with more than $34,000 to buy back
the stolen goods -- had learned which stores were being hit
hardest and had stepped up security there. "It served its
purpose," says Ronald Kravitz, Evans's security chief.
