   New York -- A curious set of circumstances brought me to
afternoon tea at the aptly named Gold Room in the Helmsley
Palace Hotel here last week. You doubtless remember that in
March of this year I reported to you about my churlish
ineptitude during a tea-taking in London. In a letter
responding to that article, Lisa Sample of Iselin, N.J.,
noted that it was hardly necessary for me to trek all the way
to Mayfair to distinguish myself as a tea boor. There were,
she said, a number of perfectly good opportunities for me to
dribble all over myself right here at home. She mentioned two
New York hotels; I selected the one that seemed the sillier.
And so, Ms. Sample -- as the old television show used to say
-- You Asked for It]
   To please my correspondent, I really tried to do something
distinctively gauche. But at the Helmsley, it's practically
impossible to perpetrate a piece of social bumbling so
singular as to make one stand out from the crowd of people
paying $18.50 a piece for the privilege of drowning in
Lapsang Souchong and Devonshire cream. Throughout the room,
when faced with the decision as to which crustless sandwich
or piece of pastry to have, perfumed dowagers were asking the
waiter, "Can I try them all?" A vacationing family behind me
decided to let the world know they were leaving because
they'd discovered that there were no hamburgers on the bill
of fare. Voracious, cholesterol-deprived businesspeople were
using random utensils and/or bodily appendages to sample the
Devon cream.

   When the waiter presented me with the menu, I asked him if
I could keep it. I felt that, for purposes of this article,
it might be handy to have it at home with me later,
particularly if I were to decide that the reader had anything
to gain by being given a precise count of its curlicues. The
gentleman's pat reply -- and by his mechanical recital of it
I could tell that mine was hardly the first such request --
was to inform me that, no, I couldn't just make off with the
Helmsley's property, but I could, if I so chose, buy it for
five bucks. I demurred. Later, though, the waiter walked by
my table, pointed to the menu, and whispered, "If you're bad,
you can take that. I don't care." I was bad. There are 13
curlicues in the text. You read it here first.
   I ordered Formosa Oolong, which the menu claims is "An
Original Tea with Exquisite Flavour Reminiscent of Fresh
Peaches." This description may well be true if the peaches in
question were left overnight to soak in Grandma's
SweeTouch-Nee, but I found that my beverage had a taste that
I could classify only as tea-ish. Nonetheless, I did manage
to get authentic Oriental leaves in a pot of water, unlike my
companion, whose cinnamon tea was infused through a bag that
bore a label stating "blended by Ford Tea Co., Poughkeepsie,
N.Y." Poughkeepsie is, of course, where all the really great
tea blends come from. Ask any Englishman.
   A young woman in her early 20s sat at the next table with
her jewel-encrusted grandmother and asked question after
question in an incessant interrogation that sounded like a
bad dream about "Jeopardy." Did Nanna think the English
really eat all this food every day? Do they actually have
whole wheat bread in London? How sinful was it to have
seconds on the cream puff with the caramelized topping?
Wouldn't it be a good idea to collect all the missing crusts
and give them to the homeless?
   This vision of my garrulous neighbor giving her leftover
crumbs to the city's starving masses as if they were giant
pigeons was too much for my companion and me. We dipped our
pinkies into the raspberry preserves jar for the last time,
called for our check, and made a quick exit out of the hotel
and back into the real New York of rush-hour Madison Avenue.
   On the street, a wizened old woman with a thick Eastern
European accent stopped us. "Speak English?" she asked. We
nodded. "Be careful," she whispered from somewhere under her
babushka, and hooked her thumb in the direction of the
Palace.
   She was halfway down the block before we could figure out
what she meant, but it was a true Dickensian moment, and, as
such, the only thing even remotely British about our entire
afternoon.
