   EDMONTON, Alberta -- Banister Inc. said its pipeline unit
received a 55 million Canadian dollar (US$46.8 million)
contract by Pacific Coast Energy Corp., to build part of its
new natural gas pipeline to Vancouver Island.
   Banister, formerly Banister Continental Ltd., said
construction is scheduled to begin this month, with
completion set for late summer 1991. Banister said the pact
calls for it to build the Vancouver Island section of the
pipeline, which will extend from from British Columbia's
southern mainland.
