   Siemens AG of West Germany and Czechoslovakia's Tesla
Prague agreed in principle to form a joint-venture
telecommunications company, the official news agency CTK
said.
   The new Czechoslovak-managed company, with a capital of 50
million to 80 million marks ($29.4 million to $47 million),
will produce the Siemens EWSD digital telecommunication
system for sale in Czechoslovakia and for export, CTK said.
Apart from contributing to the company's capital, Siemens
will invest 20 million marks in the plant, CTK said. The
final agreement is due to be signed within three months.
