   DALLAS -- In a move aimed at heading off what it called a
"run on assets" by creditors, strike-battered Greyhound Lines
Inc. filed for creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Several other units of Greyhound's parent company, GLI
Holding Co. were included in the bankruptcy petition. The
filing was made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas in Brownsville, Texas, home of
Eagle Bus Manufacturing Co., one of GLI subsidiaries
involved.

   In addition to missing a $9.8 million interest payment on
its 13% senior notes due in 1995, as of June 1, Greyhound was
behind on about $10 million in lease payments on certain
buses and properties.
   J. Michael Doyle, senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said the company filed for bankruptcy --
seeking protection from creditors while working out a plan to
repay debt -- because creditors involved in those leases were
threatening to take possession of a number of buses. Roughly
two-thirds of the company's 3,800 buses are leased, but Mr.
Doyle declined to say how many were in jeopardy.
   "The system has much more value to everybody as an
operating unit and we couldn't afford to let a lot of assets
get out of the system," Mr. Doyle said.
   Greyhound, which has sustained huge losses as a result of
a three-month-long strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union,
said the action was necessary to ensure that it will be able
to serve its full network during the busy summer travel
season. A company spokesman said that under Chapter 11,
Greyhound will continue to serve all locations on its
network.
   The company also said that the bankruptcy court late
yesterday gave it permission to honor tickets already
purchased for future travel.
   In a memo to employees, Greyhound Chairman Fred Currey
called the Chapter 11 filing "a result of a one-time bad
event."
   "That event was not the strike, but was the strike-related
violence, which was unlawful," Mr. Currey said. "It caused
your company to spend over $50 million out of pocket on
security forces to protect customers and employees, and for
lawyers to get court action to restrain the unlawful
activity.
   "Fortunately, most of those expenses are behind us," Mr.
Currey also said in the memo. "The Chapter 11 proceedings
will enable us to recapitalize so that we can fulfill the
objective of making Greyhound Lines into the growing
customer-focused business that it must be to fulfill its
potential."
   Mr. Doyle said Greyhound is already seeking
debtor-in-possession loans from several sources and "expects
to be successful" in that effort. He declined to say how much
additional capital Greyhound now is seeking but previously
the bus company had indicated that it needed about $35
million for working capital and other purposes.
   The Chapter 11 filing comes just two weeks after Greyhound
offered to redeem about $191 million in face amount of debt
for about $86 million in cash. Amid grumbling from holders of
the Greyhound notes, the company had yet to find a source to
finance the tender offer although Mr. Doyle said negotiations
had been progressing. He said he was uncertain of the status
of the tender offer as a result of the Chapter 11 filing.
   ATU officials, who recently asked Greyhound to discuss a
possible employee buy-out, were caught off-guard by the
Chapter 11 filing. Edward Strait, president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU's
bargaining unit, said the filing would make such a buy-out
more difficult.
   He denied the company's claims that strike violence had
forced it into bankruptcy. "We wanted people punished for the
violence," he said. "They negotiated us into a strike. I
think this has been planned. The company wants to get rid of
the union."
   Other union officials welcomed the company's action. "We
might get rid of Fred Currey and reorganize this thing," said
Edward Vezza, president of the ATU's Philadelphia local. "We
could have had a good contract for all the money he spent
trying to break this union."
   Mr. Currey led a group of Dallas investors that launched a
$270 million leveraged buy-out of Greyhound Lines in 1987
from its former parent company, the recently renamed
Greyhound Dial Corp. The group acquired the assets of its
major competitor, Trailways Corp., the same year for $80
million. At the end of 1989, the closely held concern still
had about $359 million in debt on its books, largely as a
result of those leveraged buy-outs.
   Although Mr. Currey attempted to rally employees behind
his plans to revamp Greyhound, his efforts crumbled amid
bitterness over the company's contract offer earlier this
year. The ATU strike began March 2 and was followed by
widespread violence as the company hired permanent
replacement drivers to replace strikers. Such violence
eventually tapered off but not before Greyhound recorded a
$55.8 million loss for the first quarter, compared with a
year-earlier $14.4 million loss.
   A regional office of the National Labor Relations Board
recently issued a complaint alleging that the strike is an
unfair labor practices walkout. If the finding is upheld, the
company says it could ultimately be forced to rehire union
drivers and be liable for as much $800 million in back pay to
strikers.
   Greyhound officials said the NLRB proceedings will
continue despite the Chapter 11 filing.
