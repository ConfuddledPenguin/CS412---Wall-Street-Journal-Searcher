   WASHINGTON -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred C. Sikes expressed doubts that Hollywood's major
studios and the broadcast networks will be able to reach a
compromise on easing regulations that block the networks from
the lucrative rerun-sales business.
   The FCC chairman's comments signaled the increasing
likelihood that the panel will intervene and impose its own
solution in the battle over the so-called Financial Interest
and Syndication Rules. The 20-year-old regulations bar the
three major broadcast networks from the $3 billion-a-year
syndication business, largely dominated by the Hollywood
studios.

   Both sides have been locked in fruitless talks aimed at
crafting their own joint plan for lifting or weakening the
FCC regulations. But they remain far apart over even the
simplest of issues: whether the FCC should extend its own
June 14 deadline for reaching a settlement.
   Bob Daly, chairman of Warner Bros. studio, a Time Warner
Inc. unit, and the leader of the Hollywood negotiating team,
said some progress is being made and asked for a deadline
extension. FCC Chairman Sikes said he would grant one if both
sides requested it. But network negotiators balked at the
idea.
   "We see no need for an extension at this point," said Rick
Cotton, general counsel at National Broadcasting Co., a unit
of General Electric Co. "If the two parties can't agree on
even an extension, they're unlikely to agree on anything."
   "We don't want to take the pressure off them," said
Stephen A. Weiswasser, another network negotiator and the
general counsel of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. "There is time" to
reach a settlement, he added. "The question is one of will."
   The networks are still in bitter disagreement with
Hollywood producers, who supply most prime-time programs,
over such central issues as how the networks might be allowed
to acquire a partial ownership stake in the studios' shows;
and whether the networks might be allowed to enter the
foreign syndication business.
   Indeed, the two sides couldn't even concur yesterday on
how their talks are faring. Mr. Daly, flanked by other top
studio executives at a press conference here, said the
studios had made some key concessions including a new
willingness to sell the networks a partial ownership stake in
television series. Studio executives also said the issue of
foreign syndication of programs made overseas wasn't a
critical issue for their network rivals.
   "Baloney," countered Mr. Cotton of NBC in a news
conference later yesterday. He said foreign syndication
remains a crucial item on the networks' list of demands and
that they want the same freedom to do "what the Sonys and the
Time-Warners of the world can do now."
   Top brass from both sides of the rerun fight met with the
FCC chairman yesterday to review the talks. Mr. Sikes last
March had told them the FCC would take up the rerun
restrictions by June 14 unless they could reach a compromise
advising how the rules should be eased. He had banned all
lobbying of the FCC on the issue in the meantime, setting
yesterday as a one-day exception.
   The meeting made it clear there wasn't much to "make me
optimistic a resolution will be reached by June 14," though
11th-hour accords do occur, the FCC chairman said in a
statement.
   The latest clash came as NBC, hosting its annual
convention here for executives of 200-plus affiliated
stations, prepared for its broadest attack yet on the rerun
rules. Today, the station executives will descend on Capitol
Hill to meet with their local congressional delegations. They
will carry videotaped presentations and argue in favor of
lifting the rerun rules, a move that wouldn't provide any
extra money for the local stations they manage.
   Despite such high-profile assaults, some executives on
both sides of the rerun dispute maintain they could still
manage a last-minute compromise to forestall unilateral
action by the FCC.
   Mr. Weiswasser of ABC said the studios may be ready to
bend on some aspects of the rules, though any settlement must
be more far-reaching than the studios are proposing. Warner
Bros.' Mr. Daly said the two sides are making some headway on
basic concepts, such as new provisions that would block the
networks from demanding a share of rerun sales as the price
for picking one new series over another.
