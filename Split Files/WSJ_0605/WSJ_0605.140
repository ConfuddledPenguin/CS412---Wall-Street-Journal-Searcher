   NEW YORK -- Americans increased charitable and
philanthropic contributions last year 10.4%, as individuals
continued to be the largest source of giving, said the Trust
for Philanthropy.
   Contributions by individuals rose 11.7% to more than $96.4
billion. Corporate contributions rose 4.2% to $5 billion.
Contributions by foundations rose 8.9% to $6.7 billion while
bequests of estates were flat at $6.57 billion.

   Total giving amounted to $114.7 billion. The 1988 total,
which is revised, was $103.87 billion. The trust said that
after adjusting for inflation, overall contributions still
rose 5.5% and individual giving rose by 6.7%, but corporate
giving fell 0.5% and bequests fell 4.5%. Foundation grants
increased an inflation-adjusted 4%.
   The trust, established by the American Association of Fund
Raising Counsel to track charitable and philanthropic giving,
attributed the growth in individual giving to several things:
a jump in personal income of nearly 9%, an average increase
of 21% in stock prices and growing public awareness of of
causes such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
homelessness and environmental crises. Individual giving has
outpaced inflation almost every year since 1955, when the
trust began monitoring such trends.
   Religion was the main beneficiary. About $54.3 billion, or
nearly half of the total contributions, went to religious
organizations or religious-affiliated social services, up
nearly 13% from 1988.
