   In February, Builders Transport signed a non-binding
letter of intent to be acquired for $15 a share, or $73.6
million, by closely held Comcar, an Auburndale, Fla.,
trucking company.
   Yesterday, however, Builders Transport said that Comcar
isn't willing to proceed with the transaction and that the
letter of intent is "no longer operative."
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Builders
Transport closed at $10, down 75 cents.
   Builders Transport added that Trism, the Joplin, Mo.,
parent of trucking firm Tri-State Motor Transit Inc. of
Delaware, has completed its due diligence and is working to
secure financing. Trism has proposed to pay $14 cash plus $3
of preferred stock for each Builders Transport share.
   Builders Transport said it is still hopeful that a
transaction with Trism, Comcar or some other party may be
completed. But it said it is also considering other
alternatives, including an internal restructuring.
   Meanwhile, the company said its annual meeting will be
held on Sept. 18, adding that it had waited to set the date
so that all options could be considered at a single meeting.
