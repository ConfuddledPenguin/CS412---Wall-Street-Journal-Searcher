   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks surged to their
highest levels so far this year, with financial stocks
leading the advance.
   Traders say investors turned to the long-dormant financial
sector in hopes that an easing interest-rate environment will
fatten profits there.

   Weak non-farm employment growth in May, evident in the
Labor Department's report on Friday, and a subsequent spike
in bond prices has encouraged hopes that interest rates will
decline from current levels.
   "If rates are coming down then the financials are
certainly going to look more attractive," says Claudia Mott,
small-stock analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. She notes
that the stocks have performed miserably so far this year.
   Insurance stocks performed particularly well, sending the
Nasdaq Insurance Index up 7.72, or more than 1.5%, to 514.86.
As of Friday's close, the index was down about 7% for the
year.
   Mary-Alice Dennehy, OTC trader at insurance-stock
specialist Conning &amp; Co., says there may be some
follow-through in insurance stocks today.
   She notes that trading activity in St. Paul Cos., the OTC
market's largest insurance stock by market capitalization,
was strong both Friday and yesterday. The stock gained 3/4 to
59 1/2 on volume of about 594,000 shares, almost three times
its average daily volume.
   Insurance companies earn higher margins with lower
interest rates, and their bond investments surge in value
when rates come down.
   Among the OTC market's other big insurance stocks that
gained were Ohio Casualty, which rose 2 1/2 to 46 1/2, and
Safeco, which gained 1 5/8 to 39 1/4.
   The buying helped push the Nasdaq Financial Index up 6.25,
or 1.6%, to 398.65. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes the
OTC market's largest nonfinancial stocks, gained only about
1%.
   But the rotation into financial stocks allowed the OTC
market to extend its string of gains, with the Nasdaq
Composite Index adding 3.48, or 0.75%, to 465.61 -- its
highest level so far this year.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, meanwhile,
hit a new all-time high, breaking above the 200 level with a
1.1% gain.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,082 to 907. National Market
System volume moderated to 107,262,500 shares from Friday's
robust 120,669,600 shares.
   Intel led the most-active list with a 1 point gain to 48
1/2. The company moved the expiration of its 1992 warrants up
to July 25. Each warrant entitles the holder to buy 1.5
shares of Intel for $45.
   Also on the list, Oracle Systems added 5/8 to 20 1/2.
Adobe Systems, however, fell 1 1/2 to 33 1/4.
   HEI added nearly 39%, up 1 5/32 to 4 1/8.
   Columbia Hospital has agreed to buy the company for $4.50
a share.
   Timberline Software has gained 2 to 12 1/2, after surging
16.7% on Friday. The company's executives tell Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that a newsletter may be
responsible for the sudden interest in the stock. The
newsletter estimates that Timberline will earn 45 to 50 cents
a share in 1990. Timberline's chief financial officer called
the estimates "reasonable."
   Prospect Financial lost 1 to 2, after falling 20% on
Friday. The company announced Friday that it expects to
record a charge in the fourth quarter ended in April, and may
not be in compliance with certain regulatory capital
requirements as of July 1.
   Players International surged 1 5/8 to 8. The company began
test marketing 900-number telephone games based on the hit
television syndicated game shows "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of
Fortune."
   Acclaim Entertainment slid 1 1/8 to 13 1/8. Profit-taking
has hit the stock after it surged to a 52-week high last
week. Acclaim rose to 16 last Thursday, largely on the
prospects for its video game based on the television show
"The Simpsons."
