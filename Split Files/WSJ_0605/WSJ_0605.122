   NEW YORK -- Wall Street is beginning to dismantle the huge
deal-making machinery that made so many investment bankers
and lawyers rich during the 1980s.
   With the takeover boom fizzling out, scores of high-priced
investment bankers are being shown the door at Wall Street
firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton
Holdings Inc., the First Boston Corp. unit of CS First Boston
Inc., and the Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of Salomon Inc.

   The deal slowdown also has produced pink slips at law
firms with big merger practices, such as Willkie Farr &amp;
Gallagher, Shearson's main outside law firm, and Cahill
Gordon &amp; Reindell. Cahill Gordon represents Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the securities firm that used to do 50% of all
new junk-bond issues, which financed many takeovers; Drexel's
parent filed for bankruptcy-law protection from creditors in
February.
   Even lower-paid professionals at commercial banks are
feeling the slump. Some banks built huge groups with scores
of people to crank out loans for leveraged buyouts and other
deals. Last month, Bank of Boston Corp. disbanded a 16-member
team that specialized in buy-out loans.
   Many Wall Street dealmakers rode the 1980s takeover boom
to multimillion-dollar salaries. Now they are facing lower
pay or layoffs for the first time in years. The reason: too
many lawyers and investment bankers and not enough deals.
   According to Securities Data Co., the volume of announced
takeovers world-wide this year through May fell 45% from the
same period in 1988, and U.S. takeovers alone declined 61%.
In recent months, the slump has extended beyond highly
leveraged deals to include so-called strategic acquisitions,
hostile bids in which one corporation seeks to buy another in
the same industry.
   Even now, if the deal business doesn't rebound quickly --
something few professionals expect -- merger departments will
have to make even greater cutbacks. "There's probably two or
three times more {deal-making} capacity than needed at the
moment," says Martin Lipton, a well-known takeover defense
lawyer at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz. His 105-lawyer firm
is less vulnerable to a downturn, because it didn't expand
wildly during the merger boom.
   Mr. Lipton says a lot of the capacity was built up to
handle "the type of transaction that's unlikely to reappear
-- a highly leveraged transaction, followed by the sale of
pieces" of the target company.
   Typically, he says, a hostile bidder obtained bank loans
and a temporary bridge loan from an investment bank,
refinanced the bridge by selling high-yielding junk bonds,
and auctioned half the target company's assets. Each of those
auctions often required bank loans and junk bonds, as well.
The whole sequence required a half-dozen investment banks,
four lead commercial banks and a dozen law firms.
   Though some takeover professionals see hope in the
still-healthy field of international takeovers, mainly in
Europe, many of them believe the boom times won't return
soon. "The last four or five years were the aberrations, not
1990," says Robert Friedman, co-administrative partner at
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. That law firm, like most other
large firms, plans to scale back its hiring of new lawyers
from the torrid pace of the late 1980s.
   The bloodiest cuts this year have come at Shearson Lehman,
where balance-sheet weakness required a financial overhaul by
its parent, American Express Co., in February. In the past
year, Shearson Lehman has cut 120 investment bankers,
including 40 in municipal bonds, from a force that totaled
876 a year ago.
   Merrill Lynch, which had laid claim to junk-bond
leadership since Drexel Burnham's demise, has reduced its
investment-banker population by 100, to 600, in the past
year, according to a person close to the firm.
   Jerome Kenney, Merrill Lynch's head of capital markets,
says: "The late 1980s had a soaring rise in the use of
leverage. That leverage has now gone too far," he says, and
as a result, "a lot of corporate America has to restructure."
Though Merrill Lynch and other Wall Street firms are trying
to redeploy investment bankers to do corporate
restructurings, Mr. Kenney acknowledges that restructurings
"will not replace the profits of the '88 and '89 deal
business, because those fees were so big."
   First Boston, which has hit snags on some bridge loans it
made to help clients complete takeovers, has just begun
cutting people to respond to the merger slowdown. Since
January 1989, a spokesman says, the firm has reduced its
investment banking professionals by 80, to 500. And Salomon
has trimmed its deal-maker population since February, cutting
its mergers head count to 90 from 100 and its investment
banking ranks to 410 from 420.
   Meanwhile, executives of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., two of Wall Street's top deal-makers, say they
are trimming their legions only slightly. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, behind
Drexel Burnham last year in junk-bond issues, with $78.3
million and $75.6 million in junk fees. So far this year,
Goldman Sachs has a $6.3 million fee for one issue, according
to Securities Data. In all last year, Wall Street firms
reaped a total of $807.7 million in junk-bond fees; so far
this year, the total is only $11 million.
   Speculation about cutbacks has swirled around Wasserstein,
Perella &amp; Co., a two-year-old merger firm created by Bruce
Wasserstein, an adviser who left First Boston with Joseph
Perella in 1988. The startup firm ranked third in 1989
takeover-deal volume, and a spokesman says it is still
expanding, particularly in Europe, growing from 110
professionals in February to 120 in May.
   The rapid Wasserstein Perella expansion has raised
questions about how the firm will manage its overhead. This
year, the firm can still live off fees that continue to come
in from big deals announced in 1989, such as the acquisition
of Warner Communications Inc. by Time Inc. and the hostile
takeover of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. by Georgia-Pacific
Corp. But it isn't clear how the firm will manage in 1991.
   While many people leaving investment banks are relatively
junior deal-makers, some more senior bankers are heading for
the hills voluntarily.
   Two of Shearson Lehman's merchant bankers, David Offensend
and Stephen Gruber, left this spring to become dealmakers at
Rosecliff Inc., which manages money and makes deals on behalf
of the Texas investor Robert M. Bass and several financial
institutions. And late last week, a Salomon Brothers
retailing dealmaker, Diane Price Baker, left to become chief
financial officer at R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
   While many investment bankers who entered the business in
the 1980s will be tempted to leave because this will be their
first year with less pay, they may find it difficult to
replicate their lavish compensation elsewhere.
   Most law firms say they don't have to respond as radically
to the changed climate, because their compensation wasn't as
volatile as that of investment bankers.
   But some law firms have been noticeably hard-hit. Willkie
Farr told 22 associates they had to leave by mid-1990, an
unusually large number; one reason is the deal slowdown at
Shearson Lehman, one of Willkie's biggest clients. "The
hostile-deal business is substantially dead," says a Willkie
Farr partner, Jack Nusbaum.
   But Mr. Nusbaum says that work keeps coming in from other
corporate clients, and that Willkie Farr's bankruptcy and
restructuring work is picking up. For example, Willkie Farr
is the debtor's counsel for Integrated Resources Inc., a
former Drexel Burnham client, which has filed for
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.
   Cahill Gordon, Drexel Burnham's main law firm, fired about
25 associates in February, around the same time Drexel
Burnham collapsed and its parent sought bankruptcy-law
protection. Roger Meltzer, co-administrative partner, said
the firings weren't connected to Drexel Burnham's demise or
the deal slowdown, because the firm has an "active and
diversified practice."
   But Mr. Meltzer acknowledges that Cahill Gordon is
"proceeding business-as-usual in a different world. That
world is a lower level of mergers and acquisitions activity
on Wall Street, and a lower level of securities transactions
as a whole. People are trying to reorient themselves, trying
to figure out what the 1990s hold for the law business in
relation to the investment banking business."
   While other law firms that are heavily dependent on deal
work may have avoided mass layoffs, many expect sharply lower
profits and reduced hiring of new lawyers.
   Much of the speculation about how the merger slowdown will
affect law firms has focused on Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp;
Flom, which became a 1,050-lawyer firm from the base of the
legal world's busiest mergers practice, led by partner Joseph
Flom.
   Executive partner Peter Mullen says Skadden Arps has
diversified, so that only 20% of its lawyers work on mergers.
Also, some merger lawyers have shifted into restructuring
work, an area that has grown to 75 lawyers from 25 in the
past year.
   Mr. Mullen says Skadden Arps has worked on about the same
number of deals as it did last year, but they are smaller,
and fewer get completed. And he acknowledges that Skadden
Arps's profit per partner is likely to decline in 1990 for
the first time in three or four years.
   Most big banks declined to comment on their leveraged-loan
staffing. A spokesman for Citicorp says the bank has cut the
number of bankers making senior-debt loans for takeover deals
by 25% since 1987. But the overall head count has remained
the same, the spokesman says, citing growth in venture
capital, international, and junk-bond activity.
