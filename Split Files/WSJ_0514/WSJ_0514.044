   Whittle Communications L.P., which pioneered magazines
made especially for doctors' waiting rooms, will now put
television there.
   Whittle, the Knoxville, Tenn., media company 50% owned by
Time Warner Inc., said it will introduce Special Reports
Television to about 20,000 family doctors' offices by January
1991. The new TV system will be coupled with Whittle's
existing Special Reports magazines, which are currently found
in about 19,000 medical reception areas.

   While media companies are trying various new ways to
deliver traditional media, Whittle's Special Reports TV is
considered one of the most ambitious plans to target a
particular audience -- in this case, mostly women -- outside
of the home with television. Like TV networks, Whittle said
it will use A.C. Nielsen &amp; Co. to measure viewers of its new
TV program.
   Alan Greenberg, vice chairman of Whittle, said
advertisers, for a varying range of prices, will be offered
both time on the TV program and pages in Special Reports
magazines. Whittle claims that doctors are converting to the
new Special Reports TV at a rate of 80%.
   Special Reports Television will include original
programming, described by Whittle executives as "news and
entertainment for the family." The one-hour program will be
delivered to doctors' offices on videodisk and replaced every
two weeks. The videodisks will be shown via a player held in
a single oak cabinet that also holds display shelves for
Special Reports magazines.
   The new media system from Whittle comes after criticism
from some advertisers and advertising agencies that Special
Reports magazines, introduced two years ago, were overpriced
and not read by as large an audience as Whittle originally
promised. Whittle in the past has disputed that.
   Mr. Greenberg said Whittle is guaranteeing the TV system
will be in 20,000 offices and seen by 44 million people
annually, of which two-thirds will be women with children.
Should the TV system fall short of audience promises, Mr.
Greenberg said, "we'll write checks, we'll give money back"
to the advertisers.
   Under the original Special Reports, an advertiser would
have to commit to spending $2.6 million over a two-year
period. Under the new TV program, advertisers could spend as
little as $1 million during 12 month period, Mr. Greenberg
said. The original Special Reports magazines had annual
revenue of about $40 million; Special Reports Television,
it's estimated, will generate revenue of $80 million a year.
