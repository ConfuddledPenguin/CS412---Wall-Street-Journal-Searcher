   Some Find This a Bit Spaced-Out,
   And It Doesn't Rhyme With June

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- In a bid for immortality, a
California company is shooting for the moon.
   Avcom Systems Inc., a closely held maker of
geographical-information systems, is lobbying with the
International Astronomical Union to have the Earth's moon
named Avcom.

   "It seems to fit," says the company's chairman, Brad
Bishop. "Avcom doesn't mean anything." He got the idea after
his children asked him the moon's name. "I thought it must
have some Greek name or something. But when I found out it
didn't, I thought, why not name it after our company?"
   Astronomers, however, think Mr. Bishop is a bit
starry-eyed. "I don't think there's any chance," says Ray
Batson, chief of the planetary-cartography section for the
U.S. Geological Survey. Commercial, religious and political
names are typically shunned to avoid controversy. Anyway,
"most of us feel `the Moon' is a perfectly acceptable name,"
he says.
   The satellites of other planets have names, but often with
a unifying theme. Uranus's moons, for example, are named for
characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's "Rape of the
Lock." Features on Mercury are named for artists and
musicians, while Venus's are named for goddesses and female
explorers.
   The public can submit names, which are chosen by a board
of international astronomers. An English girl, for instance,
submitted the name for Pluto. After the Challenger disaster,
many Americans lobbied for newly discovered moons of Uranus
to be named after the shuttle crew. (Instead, craters on the
moon were named after the victims.)
   It's considered poor form for astronomers to name
discoveries after themselves, as etiquette requires them to
wait for a colleague to honor them. And some suggestions are
simply inappropriate, says Brian Marsden, of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory. A one-time head of the Soviet
secret police was denied a place in the heavens because "he
did in a lot of people."
   It may be easier with asteroids, which are being
discovered faster than they're being named (4,461 have been
identified, though 1,000 remain nameless). Brahms, Beethoven
and Bach are all asteroids, as is Karl Marx. Last month, four
new asteroids were named after the Beatles, and another was
christened Eric Clapton.
