   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.

   NWNL Cos. reported net income, after securities losses, of
$1.11 a share, compared with an average estimate by analysts
over the previous 30 days of $1 a share, resulting in a
positive surprise of 11%. In Friday's Quarterly Earnings
Surprises table, the estimate was incorrect because of a data
base error at Zacks Investment Research. As a result, the
company's earnings were mistakenly listed as a negative
surprise.
