   Ah, Washington. The part of it most people can see is
presumably consumed with the possibility of a grand deal on
the deficit. Out of view, more important matters are being
dealt with.
   For the first time, last year, the House placed limits on
the free mailing privileges incumbents use to bombard voters
with news of their good works. But the House isn't required
by law to abide by them; it can just pass a supplemental
appropriation months later to cover any overspending. And so
the Members will exhaust this year's $44 million franking
allowance by the end of this month. The Postal Service thinks
the House eventually will spend $80 million this year sending
out 535 million pieces of free mail explaining why voters
should send them back to Washington.
