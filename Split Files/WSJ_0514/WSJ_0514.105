   HINDERLITER INDUSTRIES Inc. (Tulsa, Okla.) -- John L.
Robertson, 70 years old, resigned as chairman, chief
executive officer and director of this metals manufacturer.
Mr. Robertson, who intends to remain as a consultant, quit
his posts because "he came to the point that he didn't want
to remain full-time, day-to-day," said Timothy Brasher, chief
financial officer. Mr. Brasher said the board plans to meet
"in a month or so" to discuss possible successors.
