   TEKTRONIX Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it downgraded the senior debt rating on
Tektronix to Baa-3 from Baa-2, and lowered the rating on its
commercial paper to Prime-3 from Prime-2. About $150 million
of securities are affected by the action. The rating concern
said the downgrading reflects the likelihood of continued
weak revenue growth, low margins and reduced cash flow
protection for debt. A spokeswoman for the electronics
concern had no comment on the action.
