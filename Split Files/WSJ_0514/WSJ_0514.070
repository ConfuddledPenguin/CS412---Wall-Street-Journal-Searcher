   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's lower house of Congress approved a
constitutional amendment that will allow the return of the
commercial banking system to private investors. Even before
the vote, which would repeal the 1982 bank nationalization,
there were indications the plan was fortifying the confidence
of Mexican investors.
   The proposal by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was
passed Saturday by a vote of 339 to 54, with 12 abstentions.
The amendment needed approval of two-thirds of the 500-member
lower house.

   The bill overcame its only obstacle when deputies from the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party pledged to the
conservative National Action Party to draft restrictions on
banking monopolies and preferential lending to the
government. The amendment is expected to win approval easily
in the Senate and state legislatures, which are controlled by
the ruling party.
   Analysts say the state's 66% stake in the 18 commercial
banks could sell for between $3.5 billion and $6.5 billion.
The government hasn't indicated how or when it will sell off
its holdings.
   The move to privatize the banks has already cheered
Mexican investors. Last week, Mexican interest rates tumbled
to 36.6% from 42.6%. At the lower level, the government would
save about $3 billion in interest payments annually on its
domestic debt. Interest rates are high in Mexico to encourage
investors to keep their savings in pesos. The government is
hoping the banking privatization will show the state is
serious about overhauling the economy and inspire the
repatriation of some of the $80 billion Mexicans hold abroad.
   Important issues remain to be resolved this summer when
Congress debates the regulatory framework of the privatized
financial system. Some politicians want tight limits on the
bank stock holdings of individual investors. There is also
discussion over the extent to which foreigners should
participate in the banking system and whether to keep at
least one of the big commercial banks in state hands.
   Observers were surprised the move to privatize banks
didn't generate more controversy. One poll showed only 15% of
those questioned opposed the idea, while more than one-third
had no idea it was being considered. It was no coincidence,
analysts say, that Mr. Salinas scheduled the Congressional
debate to coincide with last week's visit by Pope John Paul
II, which captivated millions of Mexicans.
   Even so, the bank privatization, coupled with Mexico's
recent decision to hold talks with the U.S. on a free-trade
agreement, manifests a new boldness on the part of Mexican
policymakers, analysts say.
   Mexico has sold or liquidated about 700 state-run
enterprises since 1986, but only recently has Mr. Salinas
focused on important but politically delicate sectors such as
finance, telephones and steel. Before his first
state-of-the-union address last November, he never publicly
uttered the word "privatization," opting instead for the less
politically charged "disincorporation."
   Analysts say the president is stepping up the pace of
economic reforms out of the realization that the initiatives
he launched in his first year in office have achieved only
modest benefits. Last year, his key economic-policy
accomplishments were the renegotiation of Mexico's $93
billion foreign debt and a liberalization of the
nationalistic foreign-investment law. But neither measure has
guaranteed Mexico the capital inflows it urgently needs to
cover a deficit in its current account, the broadest measure
of trade, estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion.
