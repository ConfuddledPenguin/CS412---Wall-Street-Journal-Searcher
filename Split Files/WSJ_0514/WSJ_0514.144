   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and his top aides sought to
reassure Democrats that the administration is sincere about
negotiating a compromise to shrink the swelling federal
deficit.
   Mr. Bush, Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget Director
Richard Darman attempted to repair the damage Mr. Sununu did
last week when he told reporters that Democrats could propose
taxes, but that the White House would reject them. All three
sought to return to previous declarations that the bipartisan
talks begin tomorrow with "no preconditions."

   Mr. Sununu was more cautious yesterday, saying on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that "The White House would be likely to
look askance" at taxes. He displayed a modicum of flexibility
by noting that the administration finds some "user fees and
other revenue raisers" more acceptable than others.
   And, given the opportunity on several occasions during his
television appearance, Mr. Sununu declined to repeat the
president's no-new-taxes campaign pledge.
   Democrats are proceeding with the talks, but with great
wariness that the administration is setting a trap to blame
them for the tax increases that are certain to be part of any
significant deficit-reduction package. With each side
insisting publicly that the other be the first to propose any
tax increases, the talks could bog down. But the point of
closed-door bargaining is to find a way to share the blame
for an unpopular combination of spending cuts and tax
increases. Accused by one reporter yesterday of being
deliberately vague, Mr. Darman said, "That's constructive."
   "The tricky part is getting all of the parties to get from
where they are right at the moment to what they might agree
on without getting themselves in such an argument that the
thing falls through," Mr. Darman said on ABC's "This Week
with David Brinkley."
   Mr. Bush sought out reporters aboard Air Force One on
Friday in an acknowledged attempt to restore Democrats'
confidence in his good faith. "I made this proposal that we
meet with no conditions, and that's exactly the way it's
going to be." He wouldn't talk about his willingness or lack
thereof to accept tax increases. "I'm not going to show you
my hand," he said.
   Dismissing suggestions that Mr. Sununu might be in trouble
for roiling the waters before negotiations began, Mr. Bush
insisted it is "silly . . . stupid" to suggest his chief of
staff is in hot water. The president expects more flaps over
the tax question before the negotiations are concluded.
"Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your
snorkel above the water level and do what you think is
right," he said.
   Democrats seemed prepared to accept Mr. Bush's assurances.
Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),
accompanying Mr. Bush on his flight to Texas, said that the
budget summit is "back on track -- as long as we keep these
fellows in line who are trying to redefine it."
   But Mr. Sununu once again ruffled feathers on Capitol
Hill, asserting yesterday on NBC that the catalyst for the
president's invitation to talk isn't so much the economy, but
the inadequacies of Congress. Acknowledging that Mr. Bush's
budget plan isn't sufficient, Mr. Sununu complained that "the
failure of Congress to do any constructive revision . . .
since the president sent it up is part of the problem we
have."
   In response, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser
(D., Tenn.) said, "The chief of staff is off base once
again." He suggested pointedly that Mr. Sununu leave
negotiating to Mr. Bush and Mr. Darman.
   Mr. Darman said that negotiators should aim at a package
to cut the deficit by between $45 billion and $55 billion --
even though he said meeting deficit targets set by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law would require between $50
billion and $100 billion in cuts, or "over $100 billion" if
all the spending on the thrift industry bailout is included.
Part of any agreement is likely to be the exclusion of thrift
spending from the Gramm-Rudman calculations.
   The Gramm-Rudman law sets a deficit target of $64 billion
for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. If Congress and the
president fail to reach a compromise, deep across-the-board
spending cuts will be triggered in October.
