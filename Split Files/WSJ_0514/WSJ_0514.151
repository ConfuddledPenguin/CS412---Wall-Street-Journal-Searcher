   UNITED NATIONS -- Thirteen nations have pledged $106.4
million in emergency food and relief aid for Mozambique, a
country torn by civil war for more than a decade, U.N.
officials said.
   They said the aid was pledged in response to a U.N. appeal
to assist 1.4 million internally displaced Mozambicans and
154,000 returnees from neighboring states.

   The pledges, made in late April and reported Friday, fell
$30 million short of the 1990-1991 emergency requirements of
$136 million requested by the government of Mozambique and
the U.N.
