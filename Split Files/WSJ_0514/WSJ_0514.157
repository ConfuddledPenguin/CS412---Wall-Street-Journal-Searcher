   American policy toward Indochina was pretty much swept
under the national rug with the fall of Saigon, but the
beginnings of a new debate have been stirred by the ongoing
controversy over an ABC News documentary on Cambodia. For the
latest installment in TV criticism see the accompanying
letter by Stephen Morris and the editorial below (See:
Letters to the Editor:  Cambodia vs. Vietnam's Colonialism
and Review &amp; Outlook (Editorial): ABC's Documentary -- WSJ
May 14, 1990). But to think about Cambodian policy, start by
recalling that this is not a conflict that conveniently pits
bad guys against good guys. There are communist forces on
both sides.
   The Khmer Rouge, the communists who took over Cambodia
when America lost in Vietnam, are currently waging a
guerrilla war against the Hanoi-backed government in Phnom
Penh. Before being evicted from power by the Vietnamese, they
compiled a ghastly record, and they would probably wreak
further horrors given the chance. It's also true that the two
non-communist resistance factions are an unpromising lot,
likely to lose out to their erstwhile allies, the Khmer
Rouge, in a grab for Phnom Penh.

   The non-communists -- who do receive aid from the U.S. --
are renowned for their corruption, especially in their own
camps. They are headed by Prince Sihanouk, who has never
shown himself much of a friend to the West. Indeed, before
Sihanouk's falling out with the Vietnamese, he produced such
effusions as "My War With the CIA," a memoir in which he
detailed his dealings with Hanoi and the communist factions
that eventually helped topple the dominoes of Laos and
Cambodia.
   It is entirely possible, though, that the Khmer Rouge
stand a good chance of retaking Cambodia with or without the
efforts of the non-communist resistance. In our own inquiries
in Thailand and the Far East generally we have never heard of
any proof that the U.S. provides direct military aid to the
Khmer Rouge. It is of course true that both the
non-communists and the Khmer Rouge are fighting the same
enemy, and it is probably true that the Khmer Rouge -- with
their better organization, superior numbers and clearer goals
-- would probably swallow up the other resistance factions in
the end.
   The odd leap made by many commentators, however, is that
if the U.S. doesn't go on backing the Cambodian resistance,
it should start backing the Vietnamese-installed regime of
Hun Sen in Cambodia as well as Vietnam's government in Hanoi.
But both the Phnom Penh and the Hanoi regimes are still
ruthless governments (see Amnesty International's report on
Vietnam, February 1990).
   Indeed, as Mr. Morris points out, a major reason the Khmer
Rouge are able to gather any support inside Cambodia is that
they play to the hatred with which many Cambodians regard
their Vietnamese overlords. The Khmer Rouge may indeed have
captured the powerful force of nationalism, unless the
non-communist resistance is more viable than it looks.
   Vietnam last September put on a show of pulling its troops
out of Cambodia. But journalists who have traveled in
Cambodia and Western diplomats in Bangkok say there is clear
evidence that Vietnamese troops have since returned to
Cambodia -- if indeed they ever left -- to support the Hun
Sen government which most Cambodians hate.
   Even institutions as eager to return to Vietnam as the
Asian Development Bank have had to back off on Hanoi's word
that it is out of Cambodia. A source at the ADB tells us that
it had laid the ground for renewal of aid to Vietnam pending
withdrawal from Cambodia; last September its then-president,
Masao Fujioka, had the Bank put together a confidential
report on the Vietnamese economy and then went there himself.
But aid resumption was put on hold because there was too much
reason to believe the withdrawal was bogus.
   Also, there are reports leaking out of Laos these past few
months that the Lao government -- possibly with Vietnamese or
even Soviet backing -- has been using chemical warfare
against resistance fighters along the Thai-Lao border, and
against rebellious civilians further inside Laos, around the
Plain of Jars. Surely such reports should at least be
investigated before the U.S. decides to place its trust in
Vietnam, or provide anything in the way of aid or recognition
to Hanoi.
   Vietnam keeps trying to present itself to the West as a
sort of Third World waif. But Hanoi's politburo runs a huge
army equipped with Soviet weapons, and it plays host to a
huge Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay and an airfield at Da Nang.
This does not reflect a harmless Vietnam.
   With regard to Cambodia, this leaves U.S. policy makers in
a painful dilemma. Should they send enough aid to keep the
non-communist resistance alive, hoping for the kind of
long-shot lurch we've seen in other parts of the world
lately? It's worth noting that there indeed has been talk of
holding a U.N.-sponsored election in Cambodia. Or should the
U.S. abandon the non-communists to their fate, to avoid
indirect help to one side or the other in the struggle
between the Khmer Rouge and Hanoi? Our view is that as a
matter of morality, the U.S. should aid non-communists
willing to fight. But as a matter of realpolitik, we suspect
that the Cambodian non-communists are simply too weak.
   America's mission is certainly not to sort out the
quarrels of two vile and competing communist groups. The
wisest course at this juncture is for the U.S. to send the
basic messages that we oppose communism and where possible we
actively support freedom. This would mean, for instance,
taking more Vietnamese refugees into the U.S.
   The bottom line is, having lost the war in Indochina, the
U.S. doesn't have enough clout right now to sway any outcome
in Cambodia. In all likelihood it will have to wait, as it
did in Eastern Europe, until a decent and geniune option
somehow manages to arise from the awful brew that began with
the arrival of communism in Southeast Asia.
