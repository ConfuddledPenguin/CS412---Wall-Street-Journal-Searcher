   On a recent flight to Stockholm, a Seventh Avenue fashion
executive told me of a New York merchant who recently set up
shop on a main street in Moscow. What currency is he getting
paid in? I asked automatically. "Oh, he is confident of
working something out," he said, glibly.
   When China opened up, it was the same story. Starry-eyed
Americans made junkets there full of ideas of selling to one
billion Chinese. Then they learned about the currency
problems. Some left immediately. Others thought they could
beat those problems, and lost their investment. Still others
figured out that they could export and earn hard currency,
but then they learned about other problems.

   If, despite recognizing all the hazards, one is still
intent on testing the waters in the Soviet Union or Eastern
Europe, there is a better way: the Finnish connection. The
Finns have been trading with and investing in the Soviet
Union, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic countries for decades,
perhaps centuries.
   After World War II the Finns owed the Soviets a sizable
reparation. And they paid it off, essentially by trading
goods to reduce the debt. Despite a deep-seated mistrust of
Russian intentions (based on years of outright and
semi-feudal domination by Russia), the Finns learned a lot
about doing business with the Russians. And because the Finns
always delivered on their promises, the Russians learned to
trust them and rely on their word. Until the past few years,
the Soviet Union was Finland's number one trading partner.
   While many people have traded places during Mikhail
Gorbachev's perestroika, the language, culture, business
practices and bureaucracy have not changed. And the Finns
have profited nicely from their knowledge and experience.
   Estonia is the closest Baltic republic to Finland, and the
only country outside of Finland where most people also
understand the Finnish language. Naturally, Finns have more
joint ventures in Estonia than elsewhere, including two
hotels, industrial maintenance projects, two
microcomputer-software joint ventures, and a fish processing
plant in Tallinn.
   Elsewhere in the Soviet Bloc, examples of recent Finnish
joint ventures are practically limitless. They include a
plywood project, a copper-wire joint venture, a petrochemical
project, ice crushers, ferry vessels, and the remodeling of
hotels in Leningrad and Moscow.
   Several shrewd American companies have noticed all this.
One well-known example is Combustion Engineering, which with
a unit of Neste, the giant Finnish-state oil and
petrochemicals firm, hopes to penetrate the Soviet market.
   Two lesser-known examples -- one financial, the other
industrial -- may end up becoming more typical of the
American-Finnish-Soviet "troika" arrangement.
   The parties involved in the banking and finance troika are
First Chicago, the Moscow Narodny Bank, and Finland's
Postipankki, one of the four largest banks in that country.
Postipankki's experience in Soviet ventures, even before the
troika was formed, included the first Western loan for a
venture based on Vnesheconombank's (the Soviet bank for
foreign economic affairs) risk. The expertise and financing
ability of the Finnish bank was crucial to the success of
this three-way venture.
   First Chicago brought the regional marketing strength of
its U.S. client base, including depth of experience in
financing the Midwestern grain trade with the Soviets.
Postipankki brought, in addition to its expertise in
financing Soviet joint ventures, a triple-A rating and
offices in New York, London and Moscow. Moscow Narodny is
London-based and Soviet-owned, with widespread and close
contacts throughout the U.S.S.R. And its main business is
financing East-West trade. It knows every trick in the book,
and its management keeps up with the latest innovative
financing techniques.
   The initial aim of this joint venture is to sell financing
services, primarily in support of capital-intensive projects
in Eastern Europe. Its minimum project size is $20 million to
achieve economies of scale. Typical projects use a 70-30
debt-equity structure, majority Western equity, export
credits and other government guarantees where available, and
debt-equity swaps and other mechanisms to reduce risk where
possible.
   One industrial troika has as its Finnish partner the
nation's largest construction company, Haka (part of EKA
Corp.). The U.S. partner is Transisco Industries Inc., a
relatively small San Francisco-based firm with a patented
Uni-temp heating system that can be used to retrofit rail
tank cars. These retrofitted cars are then leased along with
other special-purpose cars to customers.
   The Russian partner? There actually are two. The larger
share is owned by the Soviet Ministry of Railroads, and the
other by the Ministry of Petrochemicals. In the U.S.S.R., 80%
of all transport is by rail, which represents, in turn, 50%
of commercial rail transport world-wide. Most Soviet exports
are chemicals. Thus the link between these two ministries.
And nobody produces specialty rail cars in the U.S.S.R.
   Haka had been cooperating with the Soviet Railways since
1982 with the construction of a repair workshop for rail
cars. Haka then formed a group to concentrate on solving
problems in rail communications, which deepened its
relationship with SovRails.
   When Haka learned of Transisco and its Uni-temp
technology, the parties signed a licensing agreement in 1987,
including rights to sell to the U.S.S.R. Then they made a
contract to retrofit two prototypes for the Ministry of
Petrochemicals. Rail cars used for oil products build up
large residues, which are difficult to clean. The Uni-temp
process requires less cleaning, and results in lower costs.
By entering into this joint venture, the Soviet Ministry of
Rails showed progress on solving an important problem.
   The Transisco joint venture was registered in June 1989,
having submitted documents in March. In the meantime,
Transisco also has become involved in several East European
troika ventures with its Finnish partners. Says Marvin
Hughes, president of Transisco Trading Co. (a subsidiary of
Transisco Industries): "There's no way we would have gotten
involved in the Soviet and East Bloc ventures without using
the Finns as our partners. They can speak to and sound out
the Russians like nobody from the States can. And this isn't
the last of our ventures with the Finns in Russia or the East
Bloc, either."
   By taking advantage of the Finnish window, U.S. firms can
save a lot of time and money when trying to penetrate Soviet
and East European markets.
