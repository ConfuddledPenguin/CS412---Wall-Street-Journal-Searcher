   LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. -- Advantage Life Products Inc. said
it expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit to be
comparable to its third-quarter results and below analysts'
expectations because of a major customer's financial
problems.
   The customer, Ames Department Stores Inc., recently sought
bankruptcy-law protection while it reorganizes to pay its
debts. Advantage Life, a distributor of smoking cessation
products, said that over the past 12 months, Ames has
accounted for about 15% of its revenue.

   Advantage Life reported net income of $350,000, or seven
cents a share, on revenue of $3.1 million in its third
quarter ended Jan. 31. In the fourth quarter ended April 30,
1989, the company had income of $323,000, or seven cents a
share, on revenue of $2.1 million. The company didn't pay any
taxes in the year-ago quarter.
   Advantage Life said Ames owes about $360,000 from the
purchase of anti-smoking kits. Ames also has ordered between
$250,000 and $300,000 of smoking-deterrent gum that Advantage
Life said it expected to deliver last month; now the company
expects to deliver in the current quarter.
   "The long-term impact on Advantage sales will depend on
(Ames's) reorganization plan," said William W.F. Cowie,
Advantage Life chief financial officer. "The filing will have
no short-term impact on the company's viability," he said.
Advantage Life said it expects its Ames business to continue,
but at lower levels.
