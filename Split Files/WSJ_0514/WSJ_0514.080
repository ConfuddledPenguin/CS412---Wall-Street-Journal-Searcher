   For 10 years, Ann Jones believed she was God and thought
she controlled the weather. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, she
was in and out of hospitals 35 times and was put on just
about every anti-psychotic drug available.
   Then, last year, she began taking a drug whose brand name
is Clozaril and, finally, something worked for her. Her
delusions disappeared. She hasn't been inside a mental
hospital since. In the fall, the 37-year-old Ms. Jones plans
to take courses toward a teaching degree. The change in her
life, she says, "is really wonderful."

   The drug, known generically as clozapine, is the most
significant advance in anti-psychotic drugs in 20 years, and
it offers hope to at least 200,000 people in the U.S. -- many
of them locked away in mental wards or roaming homeless in
city streets -- for whom conventional treatment has failed.
But few of them are getting the drug or are likely to get it
anytime soon. The reason is money: Clozapine costs $8,944 a
year, and nearly everyone who stands to benefit from it is
poor.
   In many states, mental-health agencies and Medicaid
programs, strapped for cash, can't -- or won't -- pay for
clozapine. Some private insurers are balking at coverage.
Even where money is available for initial treatment,
physicians are reluctant to prescribe the medicine without
assurance that patients will be able to go on taking it.
   "Clozapine is a rich man's drug for a poor man's disease,"
says Larry Lehmann, associate director for psychiatry at the
U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs in Washington.
   The drug spotlights -- much as the costly AIDS drug AZT
has -- the conflicts that arise between companies seeking to
market and profit from new medicines and the welfare of
patients who need them. It raises tough questions about
trade-offs necessary when beneficial treatments also have
potentially devastating side effects. And in the near-term,
at least, it poses an economic challenge to a health care
system already saddled with huge costs. Lawyers around the
country are contemplating legal action to require states to
make clozapine available to those who might benefit. At the
current price, that could cost somebody $2 billion.
   As a consequence, the nation's mental-health system, which
already spends more than $7 billion a year to treat
schizophrenia, has been in an uproar ever since Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals Corp. introduced the drug on Feb. 5. The
company packages the drug along with a mandatory and
expensive blood-monitoring system designed to detect a side
effect that could otherwise be fatal to as many as 2% of
patients. Without its proprietary system, Sandoz says, some
patients will die and the drug will inevitably be pulled from
the market.
   The blood monitoring is the more expensive part of the
package and, because of it, critics say, few will be able to
afford the drug anyway. So state mental-health leaders,
Medicaid officials, pharmacists, members of Congress and the
secretary of veterans affairs have mounted an intense, and
thus far unsuccessful, effort to force Sandoz to uncouple the
drug from the blood-testing program -- or at least itemize
the costs -- and cut the price. The issue is the subject of a
major forum today at a meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association in New York.
   "People are desperate to use this drug," says Mona
Bennett, the deputy commissioner for mental health in
Massachusetts. "We can't not use it." But treating the
state's eligible patients would cost $5 million, "which we
simply do not have."
   Schizophrenia is a mysterious, little-understood mental
disorder that typically strikes people in their late teens
and early 20s. It affects about 1% of the population, or
about 2.5 million Americans. On any given day, schizophrenics
occupy 25% of the nation's hospital beds, according to a
study by John Talbott, a psychiatrist at the University of
Maryland.
   Its victims suffer from paranoia, hallucinations and
delusions -- they hear voices, converse with telephone poles,
send brain waves through televisions and radios and believe
secret agents, presidents or aliens are out to kill them.
Psychiatrists call these the "positive" symptoms. The
"negative" symptoms include apathy, lack of motivation and
physical and emotional withdrawal.
   About 25% of schizophrenics suffer only infrequent
psychotic episodes, and another 50% can be treated adequately
with such drugs as Thorazine, Haldol, Mellaril and Prolixin.
These medicines, however, usually don't alleviate the
negative symptoms that rob schizophrenics of their ambition,
and they cause nasty side effects -- stiffness and
restlessness in more than 60% of patients, and more severe
twitching and involuntary body movements called tardive
dyskinesia -- in about 20% of patients.
   The remaining 20% to 25% -- perhaps as many as 500,000
people -- don't respond to any conventional medication, or
develop side effects so severe that they can't take the
drugs. Considered "treatment resistant," they live lives that
amount to "a roller-coaster ride through hell," as one
patient describes it.
   The trip sometimes starts in private institutions, where
costs can amount to $200,000 a year or more and can thus
quickly deplete insurance benefits and family resources.
Unable to hold even menial jobs, patients often end up on
public assistance. Many are either confined in state mental
hospitals or admitted so frequently that the wards become a
second home. As many as 20% attempt suicide.
   Sandoz is the U.S. subsidiary of Sandoz Ltd., the Swiss
drug giant, which first developed clozapine in 1961 and
introduced it in Europe 10 years later. The drug sparked a
great deal of interest in the U.S. in 1988, when Herbert
Meltzer, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, John Kane of Long Island (N.Y.) Jewish Hospital,
and other researchers published a study showing that the drug
worked far better than traditional treatments for many
hard-to-treat schizophrenics -- and essentially without
debilitating side effects.
   For the first time, a drug relieved the negative symptoms
of schizophrenia, giving patients back their interest in the
world around them. Many have been able to live independently
and hold jobs. "They come out of the woodwork," says Dr.
Meltzer. "They want to experience pleasure. That is one of
the key advantages to this drug. It's definitely a medical
breakthrough."
   But it isn't a cure. At least 40% of the targeted patients
don't respond or can't take it; for the lucky 30% to 60%,
levels of improvement vary widely. The drug must be taken
indefinitely. And nearly all patients need intensive
psychotherapy and social and vocational rehabilitation if
they are to re-enter society. "One patient compared herself
to Rip van Winkle," Dr. Meltzer says.
   The drug's biggest drawback is that it can kill people.
Sandoz learned that the hard way in 1975, when several
patients in Finland died, victims of virulent infections that
developed after clozapine induced agranulocytosis, a
condition that blunts the body's ability to produce
infection-fighting white blood cells. Sandoz yanked the drug
from the market temporarily. Clinical trials in the U.S. were
canceled.
   In the mid-1980s, the FDA agreed to reconsider clozapine.
And, on the basis of the "amazing" results of the 1988 study,
says Paul Leber, director of the agency's
neuropharmacological drug division, the FDA took steps to
approve it despite the danger. Through the mid-1980s, Sandoz
says, 43 patients died among 112 who developed
agranulocytosis world-wide. (More recently in the U.S., 18 of
1,800 users developed the condition, but it was successfully
reversed in each case when patients were taken off the drug.)
   "Everyone involved understood that there would probably be
deaths," Dr. Leber says. "The question was, is the bang big
enough to make it worth this kind of risk. The {FDA's expert
advisers were} fairly convinced that this was a dramatic
thing."
   The agency was even more enthusiastic when Sandoz decided
that the drug would be dispensed only in concert with a
monitoring system. In approving the drug last October, the
FDA says it didn't designate a specific approach, but to
Sandoz, there is only one -- its own Clozaril Patient
Management System -- and that is at the heart of the furor.
   The company negotiated exclusive contracts with Baxter
International Inc.'s Caremark home-care division to take
weekly blood samples from each patient and to dispense the
drug, and with Roche Biomedical Laboratories Inc., a
subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., to analyze the blood
for white cells. No other company, agency or hospital can
deliver the medicine, and each patient has to submit to a
blood test each week. "The motto is: `No blood, no drug,'"
says a Caremark employee.
   The price -- no matter how much of it the patient is
taking or where in the U.S. he lives -- is the same
nationwide: $172 a week, $8,944 a year. At that price, annual
revenue could ultimately reach at least $600 million.
Sandoz's annual U.S. pharmaceutical sales currently total
$750 million.
   Sandoz says the drug will eventually save states thousands
of dollars per patient over the $66,000 it costs on average
to treat hospitalized schizophrenics for a year. But states
maintain that any savings are long-term at best. Vacated beds
will be filled with other patients. "To save money, we have
to close a wing," one official said. And patients on
clozapine will need new therapy, housing and rehabilitation,
all of which cost money too.
   "This is the most expensive treatment we've encountered,"
says Dr. Stephen Shon, medical director of California's
mental-health department. "We don't have any history with a
drug that has a whole laboratory attached to it," adds
Norwood Knight-Richardson, assistant director of the state
psychiatric institute in Alaska, where winter storms are a
daunting problem for home-care teams heading to remote
villages to draw blood and dispense clozapine.
   In Oklahoma, the cost of treating eligible patients would
exceed the state's total mental-health budget. Texas, which
ranks 48th among the 50 states in per-capita spending for the
mentally ill, would have to budget almost $100 million a
year. For California, it could be $300 million. In South
Dakota, despite Sandoz's one-price-fits-all policy, officials
say they are contending with Caremark over transportation
costs to reach patients in remote areas.
   Critics charge that there is more marketing than medicine
in the "system," that it is a clever ploy that helped speed
regulatory approval and that will camouflage hefty profit in
a package price -- before the company's exclusive right to
market the drug runs out in 1994. While they agree that blood
monitoring is necessary, they maintain the Sandoz system is
unnecessary and much too expensive. Doctors and hospitals
routinely monitor patients on other medicines -- including
AZT and some cancer drugs -- at least as life-threatening as
clozapine. The VA's Dr. Lehmann says his agency can do the
blood work for $1.86. Doctors and pharmacists also say the
system pre-empts their clinical judgment.
   Moreover, Sandoz sells the same drug in Europe at prices
as low as $20 to $32 a week, according to several reports,
and without requiring the same blood-monitoring frequency.
"We think we're getting the short end," says Tom Ahrens,
senior consulting pharmacist for Medi-Cal, California's
Medicaid program. "The whole country is."
   Sandoz has rebuffed all efforts to negotiate. The VA, for
instance, proposed its own monitoring system, with a
computerized "lock-out" to prevent the dispensing of the drug
to patients whose blood hasn't been tested. Medi-Cal said it
would pay $117 a week for the package. Sandoz said no to
both. The company has also refused to itemize the costs of
the package, thus confounding insurers, Medicaid programs and
other payers which usually consider medication, home care,
doctor visits and lab fees separately in determining how much
to pay in reimbursement.
   For its part, Sandoz says its aim is to protect patients
and the drug. The different pricing and monitoring in Europe
reflect local regulatory costs, policies and price controls.
Besides that, in the U.S. "we want to and can meet a higher
standard of patient safety," says Gilbert Honigfeld, Sandoz's
director of scientific communications, who has supervised
clinical research on clozapine since 1973.
   But Sandoz stands firm on its U.S. price. The company, Mr.
Honigfeld argues, deserves a fair return on a drug it pursued
despite long odds against marketing approval. "People forget
we're a business," he said, "we're not a charity."
   Sandoz won't sanction other monitoring systems, he added,
because it would be liable for their quality under the
FDA-approved labeling. A strict system is necessary, the
company and some psychiatrists say, because schizophrenic
patients are particularly hard to track, and many state
mental-health programs are already understaffed. Even in
carefully designed clinical trials, some patients
inadvertently went several weeks between blood checks, Mr.
Honigfeld says, which is evidence that no matter how
conscientious a hospital, certain patients will slip through
the cracks.
   "If there were a number of deaths, we would feel compelled
to take Clozaril off the market," Mr. Honigfeld says. "It
would be a tremendous loss for the many other patients who
don't develop this problem."
   Stuck in the crossfire are the patients. Hardly thrilled
with the price, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill,
an advocacy group -- mainly patients' families -- is
reluctant to criticize the company. "I don't know whether the
company has priced this fairly," says Laurie Flynn, executive
director of NAMI. "I just want it to be available." And she
thinks the cost controversy raises another issue.
   "The Medicaid system is willing to spend $50,000 a year on
kidney dialysis," per patient, she says, "but they don't want
to spend $9,000 on schizophrenia. We feel there is a stigma,
that there's a feeling these people aren't worth it."
   Currently, about 4,000 patients are on clozapine,
including 1,500 who began the treatment as clinical research
subjects. Sandoz is continuing to carry the research patients
"while the states are getting their act together," Mr.
Honigfeld says. So far, about 15 state Medicaid programs pay
for the drug, and 23 mental-health agencies have earmarked
funds for it.
   Sandoz projects its first-year sales at 8,000 to 10,000
patients. While the total market ultimately depends on how
much those who pay the bills can afford, Mr. Honigfeld sees
it topping out at about 70,000.
   Some students of the subject think that estimate is too
low. Dr. Meltzer, a champion of the drug who supports
Sandoz's view of the controversy, says that at least 300,000
people in the U.S could benefit from it. "I would hope that
if it gets scaled up, the price could come down," he says.
   As the first of a new class of drugs, clozapine may lead
to better drugs without such potentially dire side effects --
or expensive monitoring systems. Scientists and major drug
firms already are working with sister compounds that look
promising. But products are at least three to five years from
the marketplace.
   For now, the stand-off has created questions so vexing
that some doctors think it is unethical to treat impoverished
patients with clozapine. For instance, New York state has
budgeted $2 million of mental health funds for clozapine,
mostly for patients confined to hospitals. Those who get well
enough to leave the hospital would look to Medicaid for
coverage. But so far, it won't pay. Even if it did, patients
who find jobs could quickly earn enough money to lose their
Medicaid eligibility -- and then not be able to afford to buy
the drug that keeps them well enough to work. Says John
Oldham, chief medical officer for New York's mental-health
agency: "The result you want from this drug puts you in a
tremendous dilemma."
