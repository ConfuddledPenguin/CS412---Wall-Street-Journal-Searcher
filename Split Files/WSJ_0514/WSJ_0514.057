   WASHINGTON -- After locking horns for months, the federal
judiciary and congressional leaders may be nearing an uneasy
agreement on legislation aimed at reducing delay and expense
in civil cases.
   Aides to Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, have been negotiating with
officials of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
over a compromise version of legislation Sen. Biden
introduced in January.

   The negotiations may not be quite as delicate as current
efforts to initiate a budget summit, but it's close; federal
judges are very sensitive about attempts to tell them how to
manage their courts.
   "We are in agreement on the general fundamental principles
to reduce cost and delay. But it's micro-regulation by
statute and mandatory requirements that concern us," says
Chief Judge Robert Peckham of the federal district court in
San Francisco, who is leading the judiciary's response to
Sen. Biden.
   As first proposed, Sen. Biden's legislation would have
required each federal district court to appoint a local
advisory committee and to adopt a civil-case management plan
within one year. The plans were to include a procedure for
placing cases on different tracks, with simple cases to be
handled quickly, and complex cases more slowly. And judges
would have been given 45 days after the time defendants
respond to a lawsuit to set a detailed schedule for pretrial
discovery, motions and the trial date.
   The proposal, which was produced by a task force that
studied the problems of delay and litigation cost, also would
have required each court to publish periodic lists of cases
that fall behind schedule.
   In introducing the legislation, Sen. Biden said, "The
civil justice system as we know it today is not fulfilling
its basic objectives of providing the just, speedy and
inexpensive resolution of disputes." The bill had support
from Democratic and Republican leaders on the Senate and
House Judiciary Committees.
   But it wasn't long before federal judges were protesting
the intrusion into their courtrooms that the legislation
would represent. "Many thoughtful federal judges are very,
very uneasy about the signals this bill sends of legislative
incursion -- albeit well-meaning -- in the judicial arena and
what it portends for the future," said Chief Judge Aubrey
Robinson of the federal court in Washington, in Senate
Judiciary Committee testimony in March.
   While they were complaining, however, the judges didn't
miss the message behind the legislation. On May 1, the
Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal
courts, adopted its own 14-point program, requiring each
district court to appoint an advisory group to recommend a
case-management plan. But the Judicial Conference system
gives judges discretion to adopt only those recommendations
that are "feasible and constructive" and says nothing about
tracking or listing delayed cases.
   The 27-judge Judicial Conference recommended that two
model plans be developed for handling civil cases with less
delay and expense, and that the plans be tested in five
volunteer district courts.
   Now the drama has moved into a third act: negotiations
between aides to Mr. Biden and officials of the
Administrative Office aimed at producing a bill that the
judiciary can, at the very least, refrain from opposing, if
not actually supporting.
   Final details of the compromise are still being drafted
and haven't been approved by a working group led by Judge
Peckham. But its features will be far less mandatory,
according to those familiar with the discussions. They
include giving districts three years, instead of one, to
develop a plan, using the tracking system initially only as a
pilot program in a few districts, and setting guidelines and
principles that courts may adopt for civil-case management,
rather than mandatory rules. District courts that move
quickly would receive as an incentive extra funds to
implement their plans.
   Sen. Biden, aides say, hopes to settle on a compromise and
to move it quickly through Congress this year. But, says
Judge Peckham, "It is difficult to say for certain that we
will reach an accomodation."
