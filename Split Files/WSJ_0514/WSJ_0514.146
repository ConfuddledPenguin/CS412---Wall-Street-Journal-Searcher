   CONCORD, Mass. -- T.H.E. Group Inc. said the Ohio
Department of Insurance filed a complaint in an Ohio state
court seeking to assume control of the company's Oil &amp; Gas
Insurance Co. unit.
   The company said that the Ohio department alleges that the
unit doesn't meet minimum surplus requirements under Ohio
law. T.H.E. Group added that the unit "believes that it has
adequately complied with those conditions and is now
contesting" the department's complaint.

   Separately, T.H.E. Group said it has received inquiries
from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National
Association of Securities Dealers concerning its failure to
file its 1989 10-K annual report, which was due several weeks
ago. The company said it hasn't filed the report because it
hasn't completed certain audit procedures, some of which are
related to its Ohio unit and its dispute with the Ohio
department. The company added that it is uncertain when it
will file its 10-K.
   T.H.E. Group said "third parties" have indicated "in
principle their willingness" to buy its Ohio unit and the
other insurance units of the holding company. The sales, if
completed, "are expected to be at not less than {the units'}
carrying value" on its books, the company said. After
completion of the sales, the company would retain interest in
a Texas-based insurance company and certain other assets,
including a retail sporting goods store, a spokeswoman said.
   The company said it has taken steps to cut its expenses,
including the sale of its Forum Re Finance unit to an
affiliate for the redemption of a $5 million secured
debenture. The company said it expects to recognize a gain of
more than $2 million from the sale. Additionally, T.H.E.
Group said it purchased and retired $5.1 million of its
Series B preferred shares from an affiliate.
