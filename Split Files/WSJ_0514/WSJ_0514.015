   SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Industrial production in Bulgaria fell
8.5% in the first four months of this year, and there is no
prospect of swift improvement, the state news agency BTA
said.
   Last month, Bulgaria announced it was stopping payments on
the principle of its $10 billion foreign debt.

   Figures published by BTA suggested the economic crisis,
which is giving rise to increasing consumer shortages, will
not ease soon.
   The worst-hit industries are mechanical engineering,
metals, chemicals, oil refining and food processing, BTA
said. At least 7,000 workers have been laid off due to
closures of firms and production lines, it said.
