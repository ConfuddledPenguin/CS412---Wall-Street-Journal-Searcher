   NEW YORK -- In an unexpected move that further heightened
the uncertainty at NBC News, Steve Friedman, a former
executive producer of the "Today" show, is returning as the
executive in charge of the struggling "NBC Nightly News with
Tom Brokaw."
   The appointment, effective June 4, was widely perceived at
NBC News as foreshadowing the addition of Jane Pauley to join
the broadcast in a major role, perhaps as co-anchor. Ms.
Pauley, a former co-anchor of "Today," is considered
extremely popular among viewers. Equally important, she is
also popular among NBC affiliated stations, a majority of
whom were displeased when Ms. Pauley left "Today," causing
the show to plummet from its No. 1 ranking in its time slot.
Ms. Pauley did not return telephone calls to her home.

   Mr. Friedman, 43 years old, considered a gregarious,
informal and somewhat bombastic talented producer, replaces
Bill Wheatley, a 15-year veteran of NBC News who has been
executive producer of the flagship newscast for five years.
Mr. Friedman said that "nobody has ever said I have to bring
Jane onto the broadcast and no decision has been made."
   He added, however, "it doesn't make any sense just to
divide up reading the news between Jane and Tom." There was
speculation that Mr. Brokaw could often anchor from different
locations dictated by breaking news stories and Ms. Pauley
could be studio based. Since leaving "Today," Ms. Pauley has
become the primary substitute anchor for "Nightly News."
   Mr. Friedman said he does not believe in "incremental"
changes. "So what if you add new graphics?" he asked. "We
have to say this is what we're going to do and do it and hope
we're right. We're not going to be tied down to the
constipated view of the world on the evening newscasts."
   Mr. Brokaw told colleagues he was not consulted about the
change, but rather that it was presented to him on Thursday
by NBC News President Michael Gartner as a "done deal,"
according to people who said they spoke with Mr. Brokaw.
   It is considered highly unusual in broadcasting for
management not to consult the anchorman, who also acts as the
broadcast's managing editor, about such a major change. Mr.
Brokaw told a staff meeting on Friday that there were "cold,
bloodless realities" facing broadcast journalism, although he
did not elaborate, according to people who were present. He
also reportedly told colleagues that it was a "sad day" for
NBC News. In an interview, he did not comment on his reported
remarks, except to add that in reference to Mr. Wheatley, "it
always hurts to lose one of the good guys." He added Mr.
Friedman was "smart and enthusiastic" and that he always felt
Mr. Friedman was "underestimated as a hard-news producer."
   The move stunned the staff of "Nightly News," especially
since NBC president Robert C. Wright reportedly told a group
of network executives at a meeting in Princeton, N.J.,
recently that NBC News' problem was not "Nightly News", but
rather "Today." Mr. Friedman's appointment is just one of
several major changes expected at the beleaguered news
division of the National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General
Electric Co.
   NBC News is negotiating with CBS News' "Morning News"
co-anchor Faith Daniels to become anchor of "Sunrise" and
news reader on "Today," a position that has been open since
Deborah Norville replaced Ms. Pauley on "Today" late last
year. An announcement could come as early as today.
   The sudden moves by NBC News are an attempt to blunt the
expected sharp criticism from the network's 200-plus
affiliates in Washington in two weeks at the annual NBC
convention. Although the network is No. 1 in prime time and
is robust financially, the stations are unhappy with the
performance of NBC News, according to interviews with several
general managers.
   In the past year, "Nightly News" has been No. 3 for 36
weeks, while the "Today" show has lost its ratings dominance,
resulting in the stations losing millions in annual
advertising revenue.
   In an interview, Mr. Wheatley, 45, said the change came as
a "complete surprise. I didn't expect it, that's for sure."
He said he was told by Mr. Gartner on Thursday that Mr.
Gartner wanted "Nightly News" to "go in a different direction
with new leadership." Mr. Wheatley said he has been offered
other assignments at NBC News and "I'm going to take the next
few months off to see how I fit into the changing climate of
television news."
   Mr. Friedman resigned from NBC three years ago to become
president of GTG East and create a televised version of the
newspaper USA Today. The show, "USA Today on TV," which
stressed what Mr. Friedman labeled "journalism of hope," was
the largest failure in TV syndication history and went off
the air last November.
   Mr. Friedman resigned from GTG East last May and the
parent company, GTG Entertainment, a partnership between
former NBC chairman Grant A. Tinker and the Gannett Co.,
collapsed. GTG went out of business earlier this year after
Gannett withdrew financial support.
