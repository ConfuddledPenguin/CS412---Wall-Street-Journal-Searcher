   Bank of New England-West, a unit of Bank of New England
Corp., said it signed a consent cease and desist order with
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   As reported, the parent company, Bank of New England Corp.
signed a similar consent order with the Federal Reserve
earlier this year and several of its other banking units have
signed similar consent orders with the Comptroller.

   The Springfield, Mass.-based unit said the order deals
"comprehensively with the development and implementation of
plans, policies and procedures at the bank and details
improvements to be made in the operations of the bank."
   In a statement, the unit said many of the requirements and
standards called for in the order "are well under way or have
already been completed."
