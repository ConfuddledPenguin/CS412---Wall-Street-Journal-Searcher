   HOUSTON -- Southern Mineral Corp. said it signed a letter
of intent to sell its interest in the Trimble Field of
Mississippi for about $11 million in cash.
   The oil and gas exploration company wouldn't identify the
buyer, but said it expects to close the transaction by June
30. The Trimble Field, discovered in late 1988, currently
produces 25 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.
