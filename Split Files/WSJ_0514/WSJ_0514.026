   NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. -- Software Services of America Inc.
said one of its shareholders filed a class action lawsuit
against the company and its president, Bertram R. Hickman
Jr., charging that the company "artificially inflated" its
stock price by making misleading statements.
   The suit was filed in federal district court in Boston by
Sherwin E. Ross, the company said. The suit alleges that the
company made "materially false and misleading statements and
material omissions" between October 1986 and March 1989, the
company added.
