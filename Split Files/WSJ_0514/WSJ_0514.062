   At the trial of John A. Mulheren Jr., scheduled to begin
today, the 40-year-old arbitrager may have to yield center
stage to Ivan F. Boesky.
   The convicted former stock speculator is slated to make
his debut as a government witness in the case against Mr.
Mulheren. Mr. Mulheren was charged in a 42-count indictment
last year based largely on information provided to the
government by Mr. Boesky, who has completed a three-year
prison term for insider-trading-related crimes.

   In June, a federal grand jury in Manhattan, N.Y., charged
Mr. Mulheren with manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. shares and with "parking" stock for Mr. Boesky. Parking
occurs when an investor sells securities with the
understanding that they will be repurchased, usually at a
prearranged time and price.
   The government alleged that Mr. Mulheren used the tactic
to conceal the true ownership of the parked securities and to
help Mr. Boesky evade taxes and defeat minimum net capital
requirements for broker-dealers. Leonard DeStefano, a former
trader for Jamie Securities Co., Mr. Mulheren's defunct
securities firm, is charged with two counts of conspiracy and
fraud. Both have pleaded innocent.
   Mr. Boesky is expected to testify before a packed
courtroom as early as this week. But interest in his
testimony has waned somewhat since former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. junk-bond wizard Michael Milken pleaded guilty
to six felony counts and agreed to pay $650 million in fines
and restitution. Mr. Boesky's cooperation led to the
government's cases against Mr. Milken and Drexel.
   The government is also likely to call Martin Davis, the
chairman of Gulf &amp; Western and its successor company,
Paramount Communications Inc. as a witness.
   Thomas Puccio, the New York lawyer representing Mr.
Mulheren, is expected to try to prove that Mr. Boesky is
biased in favor of the government because Mr. Boesky's 1986
settlement left him with many millions of dollars.
   Mr. Puccio successfully prosecuted U.S. congressmen in the
noted Abscam bribery case. His clients have included
socialite Claus Von Bulow and former Bronx, N.Y., Borough
President Stanley Friedman. Mr. DeStefano, 34, is represented
by Thomas Fitzpatrick, a colorful New York lawyer with a wry
sense of humor.
   Prosecutors in the case are E. Scott Gilbert and Alfred
Pavlis, neither of whom has ever tried a major
securities-fraud case. The two will be assisted by more
experienced prosecutors during the trial. U.S. District Judge
Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, appointed to the federal bench in
1986, will preside over the trial, which is expected to last
a month.
   Mr. Mulheren gained widespread publicity in February 1988
when he set out from his Rumson, N.J., home in army fatigues
with a loaded rifle. He told his wife he was going to shoot
Mr. Boesky. Mr. Mulheren is on probation in connection with
that matter.
   A self-confessed manic-depressive who takes lithium to
control his problem, Mr. Mulheren is well liked by many on
Wall Street and counts rock star Bruce Springsteen among his
close friends. Last week Mr. Mulheren, who is 6 feet 2 inches
tall, showed up in court in his typical fashion, with
stylishly long hair, wearing a purple polo shirt, chinos and
brown moccasins without socks.

   JURORS CAN BE IMPARTIAL even if exposed to pre-trial
publicity.
   The nation's leading experts on the jury system, including
federal judges, lawyers and social-science researchers,
expressed wide agreement that a defendant can get a fair
trial from jurors who have read or viewed news reports of the
case prior to trial. The experts discussed the issue Friday
at a forum sponsored by the Annenberg Washington Program of
Northwestern University.
   The panelists cited research, as well as personal trial
experience, that indicated jurors aren't as strongly
influenced by publicity as some suspect -- and that most
jurors can decide a case based on the evidence despite
preliminary impressions developed from news reports.
   The issue has been hotly debated in recent months. Some
judges routinely exclude from juries people who know anything
at all about the matter. In heavily publicized cases, such as
the Iran-contra trial of Oliver North, this means seating a
jury of people who have paid no attention to newspapers or
television and have little interest in public affairs. Such a
course, argued the Annenberg program's director, lawyer
Newton Minow, doesn't serve the interests of justice.
   Selection of ill-informed jurors, added Los Angeles lawyer
Ronald Olson, reduces the likelihood of rational argument at
trial and opens the door to emotional appeals.
   In cases in which judges have refused to exclude jurors
who were exposed to pretrial publicity, studies show that the
jurors have quickly forgotten, or discounted, what they saw
on television and concentrated on the testimony at the trial
itself, panelists said.
   "Jurors who serve should file a class-action suit against
judges and lawyers and insurance companies on the basis of
slander and libel," said panelist Neil Vidmar, a professor
and jury researcher at Duke Law School, who maintained that
juries are given too little credit for the quality of their
decision-making.
   The panelists specifically predicted that former
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega and Washington, D.C., Mayor
Marion Barry, both facing drug-related charges in highly
publicized cases, will be able to get fair trials.
   The key, the panelists said, is finding jurors who can
keep open minds. The panelists said it is up to judges in
particular to question potential jurors carefully to root out
those whose minds are already made up. In addition, the
panelists said, judges must do a better job of instructing
jurors on how the process works and what their
responsibilities are.
   The panelists acknowledged that television has exacerbated
the problem of pre-trial publicity and that most people are
inundated with potentially prejudicial visual images of
arrests and arraignments. But, said Mr. Vidmar, "People can
put these aside and say, `I can decide this on the
evidence.'"

   FALSE IMPRESSION LIBEL SUIT reversed by Minnesota Supreme
Court.
   The decision by the Minnesota court had been eagerly
awaited by First Amendment experts because the case involved
claims that a news report created a false impression. Most
plaintiffs in libel cases allege specific factual
inaccuracies.
   Donald J. Diesen, the former Carlton County attorney,
alleged that the Duluth News-Tribune's series concerning his
handling of domestic-abuse cases left the impression he
wasn't enforcing the law in assault cases against women. The
jury had awarded Mr. Diesen more than $750,000.
   The court late last week reversed a lower court decision
and ruled that public officials can't generally prevail in
false-impression suits. The court found that the articles
contained only true statements or opinions and therefore any
implication was constitutionally protected criticism of a
public official. The court also found that facts omitted by
the reporter wouldn't have substantially changed the tenor of
the stories.
   "The way this decision is phrased means a newspaper in
Minnesota can publish a story that intentionally leads the
reader to a defamatory conclusion as long as each sentence is
accurate," says Patrick T. Tierney of Collins, Buckley,
Sauntry &amp; Haugh, a lawyer in St. Paul for Mr. Diesen. Mr.
Tierney says he plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In a lengthy dissent, Justice Lawrence Yetka appeared to
invite the high court to review the case. The decision, he
wrote, "virtually closes the door to a public official for
any recovery." He said the U.S. Supreme Court never intended
to protect news organizations that intentionally publish news
reports that leave a false impression.
   A lawyer for the newspaper, Thomas R. Thibodeau of
Johnson, Killen, Thibodeau &amp; Seiler in Duluth, said the
decision won't totally bar false impression suits.
   But "public officials cannot hope to escape review of
their official conduct by threatening media defendants with
libel suits," he said.

   APPEALS COURT REJECTS CHANGE in election of Texas trial
judges.
   A panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a lower court's December ruling that the
countywide election of trial judges improperly dilutes
minority representation on the bench.
   In a suit brought by the League of United Latin American
Citizens and black judicial candidates, U.S. District Judge
Lucius D. Bunton ordered that trial judges in Texas's nine
largest counties be elected from sub-districts that would
ensure minority election of at least some of the judges.
   But the appeals court on Friday, in a 21 decision written
by Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham, said the remedy ordered by
Judge Bunton "seems to lessen minority influence instead of
increasing it."
   Judges Higginbotham and Carolyn D. King reasoned that the
election of judges from sub-districts wouldn't guarantee that
minority litigants would appear before the judges they
elected because cases would continue to be randomly assigned
to the judges sitting in a particular county. In Houston, for
example, "the minority member would have a 98.3% chance of
appearing before a judge in whose election he had not been
able to vote," Judge Higginbotham wrote.
   "Where judges make their decisions alone, electing judges
from single-member districts only ensures that a small number
of governmental decisions will be influenced by minority
interests, while minority interests will not be represented
at all in the majority of judicial decisions," the judge
wrote.

   U.S. SUPREME COURT READIES computer release of its
decisions.
   With a startup date scheduled for June 1, the high court
selected 12 companies or organizations that for the first
time will transmit its opinions by computer to subscribers as
soon as the opinions are released by the justices in
Washington. The 12 include the Associated Press; United Press
International; Bureau of National Affairs Inc.; Commerce
Clearinghouse Inc.; West Publishing Co.; Mead Data Central
Inc., a Mead Corp. unit; Thomson Group and the Justice
Department.
   Each of the 12 will provide a computer connection to the
court and will pay $500 in the first year for the hookup.
Each may, in turn, sell subscriptions for the opinions.
