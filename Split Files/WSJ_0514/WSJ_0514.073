   HOT SPRINGS, Va. -- Leaders of some of the nation's
largest banks said they see clear signs of a credit pinch in
real estate and suggested that last week's meeting between
bankers and the top three banking regulators could help
prevent a broader pullback in lending.
   Joining top corporate executives from a variety of
industries for a weekend conference in this mountain resort,
bankers generally welcomed last Thursday's unusual private
meeting.

   "It will be useful," said John Reed, chairman of Citicorp.
"To have these three gentlemen meeting with the bankers can
only be good."
   In the meeting with officials of the American Bankers
Association, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
along with William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., and Robert Clarke, comptroller of the
currency, tried to allay fears that new, tougher supervision
by banking regulators would punish prudent lending. Though
the regulators denied that the session was prompted by
concern that a credit crunch threatened the economy, they
urged banks not to overreact to regulators' increased
scrutiny of lending practices.
   Asked if the message was received by bankers, Lewis
Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., said: "I'm sure it
would be."
   In reaction to huge losses on real-estate loans,
particularly in the Southwest, banking regulators have
stepped up their policing of lending in recent years. But
many bankers believe that regulators have overreacted, going
so far, for instance, as to require some banks to increase
reserves even for loans classified as performing.
   While several banking leaders here said the stricter
supervision was warranted, given the fiasco in their sister
savings-and-loan industry, they expressed concern that
regulators could have gone too far.
   "I think they had to tighten down," said Mr. Reed of
Citicorp. "On the other hand, there is no question that they
have sent a ripple through the market that is causing people
to withdraw. . . . There is clearly a significant withdrawal
of capital from the real estate market."
   "I don't know whether they're being overzealous or not,
but one wants to be certain that you don't spook an
industry," said Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase
Manhattan Bank.
   He added: "I think the concern by banking regulators is
healthy, but you're always walking a narrow plank between
being part of the solution and part of the problem."
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, interviewed
yesterday on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," also
said that bankers should adopt a balanced approach. "There's
anecdotal evidence that -- especially in New England -- there
has been perhaps a little overcorrection, but I don't want to
see it swing all the way back in the other direction," he
said.
   To date, the bankers said they saw no evidence of a
pullback in lending beyond the troubled real-estate industry.
But, Mr. Preston of J.P. Morgan said, "I think this is an
issue in terms of attitudes."
   Many of the business leaders attending the weekend meeting
of the Business Council, an association of chief executives
from the country's largest corporations, also heralded
President Bush's indication that he will discuss taxes at the
budget negotiations set to begin tomorrow.
   While many conservatives are upset at what they see as a
retreat by Mr. Bush from his "read-my-lips" campaign pledge
of no new taxes, several corporate executives here indicated
that any serious deficit-reduction package would have to
include some new taxes.
   "It is unrealistic to believe you can get a substantial
{deficit reduction} without some new taxes," said Chase
Manhattan's Mr. Butcher.
   Nevertheless, most echoed the attitude of Edmund Pratt
Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical and
health-care company, who declared: "If there are new taxes,
they ought to be used only to reduce the budget deficit" and
not spent on new programs.
   The executives also said government officials should stay
away from excise taxes that can harm the competitiveness of
American industries.
   "The only kind of tax we should raise is the personal or
corporate income tax," said Andrew Sigler, chairman of
Champion International Corp., a paper and wood-products
company. "I think I'd prefer to see it on the personal side."
