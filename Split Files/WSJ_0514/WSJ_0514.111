   Up, up and away?
   For many analysts and investors, Friday's euphoric stock
and bond market rallies unequivocally pointed the way stock
prices are headed in the long run.

   For months, bored investors have watched stock prices
mosey back and forth between a Dow Jones Industrial Average
high of about 2800 and a low of around 2600. The big debate
has been whether prices would shoot higher or sink lower when
they finally broke out of that range. Until Friday, the
weight of evidence tilted toward down rather than up.
   But if Friday's surge in bond prices really does mark a
turn toward declining interest rates -- and many analysts
contend that it does -- the stage may be set for a solid
stock market rally. Of course, nothing is guaranteed and
there remain some worrisome factors in both the stock market
and the nation's economy. However, some of the analysts who
have been very cautious over the past several months have
begun to believe that chances of a sustained rally are now
greater than the odds for a big drop.
   "The rally in the bond market is substantial enough to
justify a more encouraging view," says James Solloway,
economist at Argus Research in New York. "We're more inclined
to think positively about the market because we've gone
through kind of a dangerous period and now we seem to be
coming out of it."
   After Friday's market performance Mr. Solloway says Argus
analysts are reviewing their investment stance of 40% in
stocks, 40% in bonds and 20% in cash. Argus, which has held a
conservative view of the market and the economy since last
October, is likely to shift some money out of cash and into
stocks.
   The way Mr. Solloway sees it, Friday's stock-price
explosion was ignited by the bond market's strong run-up,
which in turn was powered by two developments: The three-day
auction of a record $31.5 billion in new Treasury debt was
relatively successful, and on Friday the government reported
that wholesale inflation in April fell 0.3%. Most economists
had estimated that the producer price index rose 0.2% in
April.
   But he doesn't expect stock prices to rocket up hundreds
of points in the next few weeks. "There are two ways to go
up," he says. "One is to go straight up, and the other is a
more gradual move that picks up steam over time."
   While the outlook for falling interest rates has pushed
stock prices out of their rut in the right direction, it will
take more to keep them moving upward. That catalyst could be
the negotiations between the Bush administration and Congress
to get the nation's budget deficit under control, says Mr.
Solloway.
   "Suddenly there's a lot of talk about Bush getting a new
pair of lips," he says, referring to the possibility of a
deficit-trimming agreement that includes higher taxes. "I'm
somewhat skeptical about anything really happening, but if we
could get just modest movement on the fiscal side, it could
have a terrifically marvelous impact on investor psychology."
   But there are still big problems confronting the market,
Mr. Solloway cautions. Among them: high corporate debt levels
and no assurances of growth in corporate profits. "We're
still in a period of danger with regard to the economy," he
says. "There are still concerns about profits and leverage,
and that should limit how strong the economy can get for some
time. But this may be the psychological turn that precedes
the economic turn up."
   Although Mr. Solloway's firm may recommend using cash to
buy more stocks, the portfolio of issues that Argus is
recommending remains on the cautious side. Food, beverage and
pharmaceuticals will continue to be the primary focus,
although utilities will be getting increased attention as
interest rates fall. Investors who want some manufacturing
exposure in their portfolios should stick with technology, he
says, and probably shouldn't venture into basic industrial
stocks, at least yet. "We think basic industry will still be
bringing up the rear, although they, too, may kick in within
a few months."
   Anthony Hitschler, a money manager at Brandywine Asset
Management in Wilmington, Del., is taking a more aggressive
view of where the economy is headed. His firm is heavily
weighted toward basic industry and financial stocks on the
assumption that the economy will rebound, although perhaps
not immediately.
   His view is reinforced by the lecture that Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave bankers last week, in which he
told them to go ahead and lend money to good credit risks.
Ever since the comptroller of the currency began late last
year to tighten standards on risky real estate loans that
some banks have made, many banks have tightened credit
standards not only for real estate borrowers but also for
other credit-seekers. To the extent that Mr. Greenspan's
comments ease fears among bankers that they won't be unduly
criticized for following normal lending guidelines, borrowers
should find it easier to meet their financing needs.
   "The reluctance of bankers to lend because of the
regulators' crackdown has to have been a drag on the
economy," says Mr. Hitschler. "Maybe now the banks will begin
to relax a little bit."
   From a technical standpoint, Friday's big rally certainly
changes the near-term outlook for stocks. Kenneth Spence,
director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers,
says $1 billion flowed into the stock market Friday, setting
in motion tremendous pressure for further buying in the weeks
ahead. "When you generate the kind of momentum we did Friday
you buy time for the market," he says. He's looking for the
industrial average to hit 2850 or even 2900 in the next few
weeks.
   But he warns that just as there remain fundamental
problems in the stock market and the economy, there are
potential technical pitfalls as well. While the industrial
average could hit a new high this week, the transportation
and utility averages almost certainly won't. Neither will the
number of stocks hitting new highs nor the cumulative total
of advancing minus declining stocks each day.
   Without those confirming indicators, Mr. Spence says, "I'm
very suspicious that this isn't a broad and sustainable
advancing market." Instead, he says, the market may behave as
it did when the Dow industrials hit their previous record
highs in October 1989 and this past January: Prices promptly
retreated.

   Friday Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which peaked late in the
session less than six points from a record high, surged 63.07
to 2801.58. The average closed Jan. 2 at a record 2810.15,
and on Jan. 3 closed above 2800 for only the second time
until Friday.
   Trading was the heaviest this year on the New York Stock
Exchange. More than 234 million shares changed hands on the
Big Board, compared with just 158.5 million Thursday. The
increase came from a combination of brisk activity among both
domestic and foreign institutions, buying to cover previous
short sales and repeated waves of futures-related buy
programs.
   The unexpected 0.3% drop in the April producer price index
laid the groundwork for the market's surge by easing concerns
about a possible pickup in inflationary pressures and by
increasing optimism that interest rates have peaked.
   Coupled with another surprising piece of economic data --
a 0.6% drop in April retail sales, which had been expected to
show a modest increase -- the PPI report set off a rally in
the bond market that drove yields on Treasury issues sharply
lower.
   As rates fell, the rally in stocks began gaining momentum
at late morning when the day's first round of buy programs
tied to stock-index arbitrage hit the market. At least half a
dozen more flurries of arbitrage-related buying, which
involved the sale of index-futures contracts and the purchase
of baskets of stocks to profit from price differences between
them, bolstered stocks as the session progressed.
   Advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbered decliners by
1,282 to 339. Among broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's
500stock index rose 8.18 to 352.00, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index gained 4.10 to 192.24 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index climbed 7.10 to 327.06.
   Friday's rally pushed the Dow industrials to its sharpest
weekly advance of the year -- 100.21 points, or 3.7%.
Previously, the biggest gain this year was 96.17 points in
the week ended March 2.
   Federal National Mortgage Association surged 2 to 38 3/4
in Big Board composite trading of 2.8 million shares as the
surge in bonds and the easing of interest-rate worries
brought financial stocks into favor.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage jumped 3 1/4 to 70 1/8.
   Savings-and-loan issues scored especially sharp gains in
percentage terms; Great Western Financial, for example,
posted a 5.1% advance by rising 7/8 to 18 1/8; H.F. Ahmanson
gained 3/4 to 18 5/8; Golden West Financial rose 1 to 28 7/8,
and HomeFed jumped 1 3/4 to 31 3/8.
   Citicorp rose 1 1/8 to 23 7/8 as 2.5 million shares
changed hands. Other big city bank issues rallied as well;
J.P. Morgan rose 1 1/4 to 36 3/4; Chase Manhattan added 1 1/8
to 25 1/4, and Chemical Banking rose 3/4 to 25 3/4.
   Consumer stocks whose results don't tend to be closely
linked to the economy were also a hit with investors, as the
retail sales data pointed to the possibility of sluggish
economic growth. Philip Morris rose 7/8 to 44 1/4 on 3.7
million shares, while Coca Cola Co. surged 3 1/4 to 83 1/4;
PepsiCo gained 2 1/4 to 69 5/8; Procter &amp; Gamble climbed 1
3/4 to 75 3/8, and Anheuser-Busch added 1 1/8 to 39 3/4.
   Pfizer jumped 3 3/8 to 60 5/8 after the National
Institutes of Health released a study that recommended use of
its drug Fluconazole to prevent recurrences of AIDS-related
meningitis. The study concluded that the drug was "at least
as effective and possibly superior" to another one currently
in use.
   Elsewhere in the drug sector, Merck rose 1 5/8 to 77 1/4;
Warner-Lambert gained 2 1/4 to 111 1/2; Eli Lilly added 2 1/8
to 71 3/4; Upjohn rose 1 1/8 to 38 7/8, and Syntex gained 1
1/4 to 53 1/4. Eastman Kodak, the parent of Sterling Drug,
rallied 1 1/2 to 40 5/8.
   France Growth Fund, a new single-country mutual fund,
closed 13.5% above the price of its initial offering. The
stock, sold at $12 a share, rallied to 13 5/8 on four million
shares; 10 million were sold in the offering.
   Honeywell fell 7/8 to 94 1/8. The company plans to proceed
with a spinoff of its defense and marine systems business
after failing to find a buyer for the unit.
