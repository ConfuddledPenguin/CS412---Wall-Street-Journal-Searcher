   BOSTON -- Boston Five Bancorp said it suspended its
dividend and expects to report a loss for the second quarter
ended April 30.
   The company last paid a quarterly dividend of six cents a
share on May 4. The holding company for Boston Five Cents
Savings Bank said it would suspend its dividend "until
earnings get back on track."

   Boston Five said it expects to make a provision for
possible loan losses of $3.5 million to $4 million for the
second quarter due to an "assessment of the New England real
estate market." Results for the quarter will be released the
week of May 21, the company said.
   In the quarter ended April 30, 1989, the company earned
$2.9 million, or 41 cents a share.
   Separately, Somerset Bankshares Inc., based in Somerville,
Mass., said it suspended its quarterly dividend of seven
cents a share because of its increase in nonperforming loans
and uncertainty about the Massachusetts economy.
