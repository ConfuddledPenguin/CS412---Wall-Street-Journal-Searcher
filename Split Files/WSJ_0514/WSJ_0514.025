   HARVEY, Ill. -- Bliss &amp; Laughlin Industries Inc. said it
sold a 39% stake in the company to Stelco Inc. for $18.7
million, after shareholders approved the plan.
   As part of the same transaction, Bliss paid $12.4 million
to acquire the assets of Stelco's Canadian Drawn Steel Co.
subsidiary. Bliss, a maker of steel bars, said it will use
the $6.3 million of net proceeds realized to pay down debt.
