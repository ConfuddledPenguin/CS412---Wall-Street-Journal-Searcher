   NEW YORK -- Mr. Coffee will soon join the ranks of
companies that went private through leveraged buy-outs but
are now turning to the equity markets for relief from too
much debt.
   By early June, the company's initial public offering of
four million shares is expected to be priced between $9 and
$11 each. Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. is leading the underwriting
syndicate.

   Of the four million shares being offered, three million
are being sold by the company and one million by existing
shareholders.
   This "reverse LBO" phenomenon is the flip side of the
1980's buy-out craze, when many companies went private with
heaps of debt. Analysts say high interest rates and a slowing
economy are now putting pressure on some of these companies
to raise cash to pay debt.
   But the market hasn't been very kind to recent "reverse
LBOs." So far this year such deals have generally come to
market at the low end or below their original price talk
range. Geneva Steel, for example, went public in March at $10
a share, far below its price talk of $14 to $16 a share. And
the offering Rival Co., another kitchen appliance maker, has
been postponed.
   But analysts cite a host of concerns about Mr. Coffee:
   The company still carries a large debt; its business is
currently based on a single product line; its market is
mature and crowded with well-financed competitors; about
one-third of its sales go to just five customers; and nearly
half its production is based in China and Hong Kong.
   But there's another side.
   Proceeds from Mr. Coffee's offering will slash the
company's long-term debt to about 53% of its total capital
from 83%. And the company states in its preliminary
prospectus that it has been moving much of its manufacturing
back home.
   Perhaps most important to prospective investors, the
company is making money once again for the first time since
1986.
   Mr. Coffee's resurgence to profitability comes on the back
of a product -- an iced tea maker called The Iced Tea Pot --
which it introduced in May 1989. The product accounted for
nearly all of the company's 24% sales increase in 1989, and
nearly all of 1990's first quarter 53% growth in sales.
   "After that initial burst of sales, it's really unknown as
to what's going to happen," says Robert Natale, who tracks
new issues for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Kimberly Rawn, director of communications at the National
Houseware Manufacturers Association, says the product drew a
lot of attention at the association's show last year and is
expected to be a big seller.
   Some consumers may realize, however, that they can make
iced tea in their existing coffee machine.
   And Al Hadhazy, an analyst for New Issues, a newsletter
that reviews initial public offerings, warns, "If things slow
down to a crawl and consumers bow out for a while, this
product isn't going anywhere."
   But Ian Gittlitz, publisher of Homeworld Business, a
bi-weekly newspaper on housewares, argues that a slowdown in
spending could boost Mr. Coffee's sales. Retailers, looking
for more bang for their buck in a slow environment, favor
recognized brand names and promotional items, he says.
   Mr. Coffee was bought by its current owners from the
founders of the company for $72 million in 1987. Nearly three
years later, most of that debt remains -- including $35.4
million in "junk" bonds on which it must pay interest of
16.5%.
   When Mr. Coffee pays off two-thirds of its debt, as it
intends to do following the offering, $37 million in term and
revolving credit notes will remain. Scheduled repayments of
the term loan portion of that debt will begin this year.
Also, Mr. Coffee will have a negative net tangible book value
of nearly $3 a share.
   The existing shareholders paid an average of $7.63 for
each of their shares, with much of that money paid in 1988 to
help the company out of its cash squeeze.
   If the offering is priced in the middle of its offering
range, those investors will have earned about 30% on their
money in almost three years. While that's better than the
total return of S&amp;P's 500-Stock Index over the same period,
it's hardly a stellar return for a buy-out investor.
   Among those selling stock is Quantum Fund N.V., managed by
George Soros. Quantum is selling about 29% of the 344,001 Mr.
Coffee shares that it owns.
   None of the selling shareholders could be reached for
comment.
