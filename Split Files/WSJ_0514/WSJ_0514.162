   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. has "identified most if not
all" of the members of a consortium that would build a
proposed high-speed rail link between Quebec City and Toronto
using French TGV (very fast train) technology, said Pierre
MacDonald, the vice president in charge of the project.
   "The consortium would be a broad group" that would include
Canadian, U.S. and international "industrial and financial
leaders," Mr. MacDonald said. He declined to identify the
members of the group but said Bombardier has "concluded
agreements with some members and is negotiating with the
others." Bombardier is a Montreal-based transportation
equipment and aerospace concern. It holds the North American
rights to the French TGV technology.

   In an interview after a presentation here to a government
task force studying high-speed rail, Mr. MacDonald wouldn't
say if the CP Rail unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. and
government-owned Canadian National, Canada's two major
railroads, have agreed to join the Bombardier consortium, but
added "we've said all along that the project can't fly
without CP and CN."
   A Canadian Pacific spokesman said "we've had discussions
with many groups {regarding high-speed rail} but we haven't
made any commitments yet." A person familiar with the
Bombardier project said Canadian Pacific staff visited France
to study the TGV train and are enthusiastic about the
potential of a Canadian TGV line.
   As reported, Bombardier proposes building a TGV line
connecting Quebec City, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. The
line would cost about 5.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$4.5
billion), of which the Canadian, Quebec and Ontario
governments would be asked to contribute about C$1.6 billion.
