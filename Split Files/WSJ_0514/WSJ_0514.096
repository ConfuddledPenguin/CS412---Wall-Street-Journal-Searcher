   NWNL Cos. reported net income, after securities losses, of
$1.11 a share, compared with an average estimate by analysts
over the previous 30 days of $1 a share, resulting in a
positive surprise of 11%. In Friday's Quarterly Earnings
Surprises table, the estimate was incorrect because of a data
base error at Zacks Investment Research. As a result, the
company's earnings were mistakenly listed as a negative
surprise.
