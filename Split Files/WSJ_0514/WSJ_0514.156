   NEW YORK -- The already-shaky dollar may be hammered down
by more heavy sales in the near term, many traders say.
   Because of the yen's sudden revitalization and renewed
speculation that U.S. interest rates are headed lower,
"Market sentiment has changed. The dollar should be the
weakest" currency rather than one of the strongest, says
Shigeru Tokunaga, foreign exchange manager at Fuji Bank Ltd.,
New York.

   Late Friday here, the dollar was quoted at 152.65 yen,
having dropped steeply from 156.70 at Thursday's close.
Against the mark, however, the dollar was quoted at 1.6478
late Friday, up from 1.6285.
   In trading in Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency opened at
152.45 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 154.15 yen.
   The dollar's 2.6% plunge against the yen Friday -- one of
the severest setbacks it has undergone in the past 16 months
while strengthening more than 25% against the Japanese
currency -- was a pivotal development for a number of
reasons.
   The drop marked the dollar's breakout from its recent
trading range of 156 to 160 yen and has left the dollar
dangerously close to an important psychological support at
150 yen, traders say.
   Moreover, there is evidence that Japanese investors at
life insurance companies, trust funds and other institutions
are getting nervous about holding dollars.
   While the dollar-yen is one of the most actively traded
exchange rates in global dealings, powerful Japanese
institutions sometimes have a big influence on the dollar's
level. The dollar's arrival at a 39-month peak of 160.30 yen
in early April was attributed largely to long-term position
adjustments by institutional investors who hadn't anticipated
such a strong rise this year.
   Much of the dollar's losses against the yen were
registered in Tokyo Friday, where there was a mad rush to
dump the currency. Tokyo foreign exchange brokers reported a
total spot transaction turnover of $21.58 billion, the
highest ever seen in Japan.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.15 yen, the lowest
finish since 153.65 on March 20.
   Institutional investors were spotted selling the dollar
aggressively after its support around 156 yen crumbled,
apparently moving to limit losses on positions in the
currency options market.
   Some institutions previously had written options to sell
dollars at levels of 157 yen and higher as part of a strategy
that would have succeeded if the dollar had traded as
anticipated in a range of 156 to 160 yen; they were caught
off guard when the floor fell out from under the dollar
Friday, market participants say.
   If an institution had to buy dollars at, say, 154 yen to
fulfill an option being exercised at 157 yen, it would incur
losses of three yen less the premium gained from the option
sale.
   Options to sell dollars, called puts, gives the owner the
right, but not the obligation, to sell the dollar at a
specified level in a set time frame. If the dollar falls
below the pinpointed price before the expiration, the put
holder may reap profits from the exercise of the contract.
   While it is hard to predict exactly what tactics Japanese
institutions and other market participants will use in the
near future, more dollar losses against the yen may be in
store, traders say.
   "We'll probably continue to see dollar selling on
rallies," says Linda McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical Bank.
She sees resistance at 154.50 yen as a roadblock that will
probably make it hard for the dollar to rebound in the short
run.
   It is too soon to say that the yen has bottomed for sure
after its lengthy slump, but the mood about it has clearly
changed sharply. Only a few months ago the yen was caught in
a downward spiral because of the hard times that Japan's
stock and bond markets went through and Japan's relatively
low interest rates.
   And while the situation has turned against the dollar, the
U.S. currency may show some buoyancy if the yen remains weak
against the mark and the Swiss franc in cross-trading,
traders say.
   The yen underwent strong upward corrections against those
Western European currencies Friday, but the gains may be
short-lived.
   Late Friday in New York, the mark was quoted at 92.639 yen
and the Swiss franc traded at 109.075 yen, down sharply from
96.224 and 112.896, respectively, at Thursday's close.
   Eventually, the dollar may fall swiftly against all major
foreign currencies if the Federal Reserve loosens its
monetary policy, traders say.
   Speculation about Fed easing continues to grow because of
more evidence of slower growth and lessening inflation.
   In April, retail sales fell 0.6%, the sharpest decrease
since October 1989, after falling 0.2% in March. The producer
price index declined 0.3% last month after dropping 0.2% in
March.
   Those data follow news about last month's unexpectedly
weak employment data.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $368.80 an ounce, down $1.30.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $367 an ounce.
