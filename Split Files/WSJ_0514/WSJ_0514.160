   Civil War it isn't. But Alabama's unfurling of the states
rights banner in a hazardous-waste dispute is disrupting
interstate commerce, promising a Supreme Court showdown and
costing companies money.
   The True Temper Sports subsidiary of Black &amp; Decker Corp.,
for example, makes steel golf-club shafts at a plant in
Amory, Miss. Because the shafts must be dipped in a rinse to
remove excess chromium and nickel, last year the facility
generated roughly 80 tons of hazardous-waste rinsewater,
which True Temper, one of the U.S.'s largest golf-club
makers, disposed of at a specially equipped landfill in
nearby Emelle, Ala.

   Last fall, however, Alabama "blacklisted" Mississippi and
some 20 other states under a new law prohibiting out-of-state
hazardous waste from being disposed of in Alabama unless the
state where the waste was generated has similar facilities of
its own.
   As a result, True Temper must now ship its hazardous waste
to another disposal facility near Lake Charles, La. The trek
is 400 to 500 miles longer, which, at the standard
$3.50-a-mile transportation cost per shipment, has added
significantly to the Amory plant's hazardous-waste disposal
costs, says Michael Justice, a Black &amp; Decker environmental
and safety manager based in Memphis.
   So it goes as Alabama's new law starts to hurt
hazardous-waste generators around the U.S. "This thing is
catching on like wildfire," frets James S. Lawson Jr.,
executive director of the Lauderdale County (Miss.) Economic
Development Authority.
   "We're very concerned about the potential for disruption"
of hazardous-waste disposal, says Dennis Redington, director
of regulatory management for Monsanto Co.
   In South Carolina, a year-old executive order has
effectively blacklisted five states. In Louisiana and Ohio,
legislators currently are considering laws similar to
Alabama's.
   Moreover, if the Alabama statute survives pending court
challenges -- and it's already been upheld by a federal
district judge in Alabama -- "It's highly likely that other
states with hazardous-waste disposal facilities will try to
do the same thing. We risk having a snowball effect that
would be a disaster," says Allen Moore, president of the
National Solid Wastes Management Association, a trade group
that has sued to overturn the Alabama law.
   As if a blacklisting wasn't enough, Alabama last month
passed a companion measure that raises by five-fold the tax
on out-of-state shipments of hazardous waste to Alabama. That
action has brought lawsuits from companies as far away as
Massachusetts.
   Nationwide, about 10 million tons of hazardous waste a
year is transported off site for disposal. About three
million tons move interstate, according to Chemical Waste
Management Inc., the 78%-owned hazardous-waste disposal
subsidiary of Waste Management Inc., Oak Brook, Ill., which
owns the Emelle facility.
   While three million tons is less than 3% of the 240
million to 280 million tons of hazardous waste generated per
year in the U.S., it's enough so that, "Alabama's actions
threaten serious disruption to the national economy as it
relates to hazardous waste," according to brief filed by the
U.S. Justice Department in the federal appeals court in
Atlanta. While most hazardous waste gets disposed of on site,
it's the really nasty stuff that often gets transported,
because only a limited number of facilities are equipped to
handle it. Only five incinerators in the U.S. are permitted
to dispose of polychlorinated biphenols, or PCBs, for
example.
   The appeals court in Atlanta has been asked by the Justice
Department and the waste-disposal industry to overturn the
Alabama law on the grounds that it violates the Commerce
Clause of the Constitution. The court is expected to hand
down its decision within a couple of weeks. However it rules,
both sides expect this states rights' case to be decided by
the Supreme Court.
   Alabama officials say the blacklist law is intended to
avoid having the state become a hazardous-waste "dumping
ground." They wanted, they say, to force other states to
confront local public opposition to the siting of new
hazardous-waste disposal facilities. "One seventh of all
hazardous waste that goes to commercial landfills gets buried
at Emelle. Other states should learn to take care of their
own," says Stacey Rimer, assistant press secretary for
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Even the Justice Department, in its brief filed with the
appeals court, agrees with Alabama that other states need to
build disposal facilities. Moreover, the Alabama law appears
to be having the salutary effect of spurring recycling. True
Temper Sports, for example, decided to seek out a
metals-recycling firm in Corpus Christi, Texas, and, in about
two weeks, will start shipping its leftover chromium and
nickel to this firm, which will reclaim the materials and
sell them to smelters.
   Still, "It's a crime what Alabama's doing," contends
Oakley Keller, environmental safety director for Fame
Plastics Inc., a Daytona Beach, Fla., subsidiary of Essef
Corp. Mr. Keller's argument is that, because of its limerock
formation, the Emelle facility is "unique geologically" and
perhaps, he says, "the safest place in the U.S. to dispose of
hazardous waste."
   Mr. Keller, whose company now ships to Oklahoma the
chromic acid, nitric acid and other nasty wastes it generates
in making business-machine housings, says that to try to
force Florida to come up with a similar facility is "nuts.
Why, at four feet down in Florida, you hit an aquifer," he
says.
   Ms. Rimer, the Alabama governor's spokeswoman, responds:
"You don't have to bury hazardous waste. It can be
incinerated."
