   WASHINGTON -- A year after a congressional investigation
exposed widespread fraud in the generic drug industry,
factions in government and industry are edging toward a fight
over how best to address the problem.
   The investigation has so far led to 13 criminal
convictions of generic drug companies, industry executives
and officials of the Food and Drug Administration, on charges
ranging from racketeering to bribery. Furthermore, more than
100 generic drug products were recalled or withdrawn from the
market in the wake of the scandal, including one of the
largest-selling generic products, generic dyazide, made by
Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Springfield Gardens, N.Y.,
and Bolar Pharmaceuticals Inc., Copiague, N.Y.

   Now the Bush administration and Congress are preparing to
wrangle over how to punish drug companies that commit such
offenses. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who chaired the
generic drug hearings, will submit a bill tomorrow that would
stiffen penalties against offending generic drug companies.
The administration submitted its own bill on the matter last
month.
   Both bills would require the Health and Human Services
secretary to bar individuals or companies who defraud the FDA
from submitting generic drug applications to the agency. The
bills also would impose stiff fines on companies that submit
false statements to the agency.
   But where the Bush administration would impose penalties
against any offending company subject to the FDA approval
process, Rep. Dingell will propose taking action only against
generic drug companies that do so.
   According to Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Rep.
Dingell, generic drug companies are singled out in the bill
because far more corruption has surfaced in generic companies
than among brandname companies. Mr. Fitzgibbons said a second
reason that generic drugs were the focus was that they were
subject to an accelerated approval process. By contrast, he
said, brand-name drug companies must submit more information
to the FDA and conduct more clinical trials, so "the
potential for abuse is much smaller."
   Another reason Rep. Dingell focuses his bill on generic
companies is that he doesn't want to pick a fight with the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents
brand-name companies. He fears that opposition from the
powerful trade group would be a big obstacle for the bill.
   The association's general counsel, Bruce Brennan, voiced
strong opposition to the administration bill in an April 13
letter to Michael Astrue, general counsel at the HHS
Department. The association hasn't yet taken a position on
the forthcoming Dingell bill, according to a spokesman, and
"may take some time" before it does so.
   One likely opponent of restricting penalties to generic
drug companies is Rep. Henry Waxman (D. Calif.), who chairs
the congressional subcommittee where both generic drug bills
will first be considered. Rep. Waxman is a longtime advocate
of expanding the availability of lower-priced generic drugs
to the poor and elderly. In a statement, he said that while
he finds Rep. Dingell's plan to bolster FDA enforcement
useful, "there are some strong arguments for expanding the
debarment provisions to cover all drug companies and perhaps
other companies that are regulated by the agency."
   The Bush administration and Rep. Waxman are expected to
oppose a provision in Rep. Dingell's bill that would empower
inspectors general in the Health and Human Services
Department to investigate industry fraud. The inspectors
previously participated in the department's investigation of
generic drug companies, but their authority to do so was
rescinded last December by Secretary Louis Sullivan after the
Justice Department voiced opposition to their participation;
he said they should confine themselves to investigating the
government.
   William Haddad, chairman of the Generic Pharmaceutical
Industry Association, a trade group, said he thought the
inspectors general had done a "superb job" in investigating
the industry.
