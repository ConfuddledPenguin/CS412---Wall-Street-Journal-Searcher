   WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators placed United Federal
Savings Bank, Windom, Minn., in receivership and chartered a
federal mutual institution to take its place.
   Resolution Trust Corp. will oversee the new institution,
United Savings Bank, which will assume some assets and
liabilities of the former thrift. United Federal had $161.4
million in assets and $173 million of liabilities.
