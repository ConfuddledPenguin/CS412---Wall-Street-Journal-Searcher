   NEW YORK -- A new cost-cutting drive at Kidder, Peabody
Group Inc. could result in the dismissal of as many as 10% of
the firm's employees, according to people familiar with the
firm.
   One target of the layoffs at the General Electric Co. unit
is likely to be its investment banking division, which
recently was beefed up and now has more than 400 staff
members, the people said.

   Kidder, for its part, stressed that it has no specific
target for layoffs. "We are continuing to look at ways to
reduce costs," a Kidder representative said, adding that
"there may be some further streamlining." The firm's head
count already is down about 200 from year-end levels of about
5,600, Kidder officials said.
   Kidder, which had losses of about $23 million in 1989,
dismissed more than 10% of its staff last year. Michael
Carpenter, chief executive officer, recently said Kidder
expected a 1990 first-quarter loss of about $25 million,
reflecting losses in selling its high-risk, high-yield "junk"
bonds and other risky investments to GE.
   The investment banking units of most big securities firms
have been hit hard by the depressed level of
corporate-finance and merger-and-acquisition activity. So far
this year, announced takeover deals totaled just $71 billion
-- barely half the $134 billion in the year-earlier period,
according to Securities Data Co. And investment-banking
revenue at many securities firms plunged more than 20% during
the first quarter from a year earlier.
   Several other firms, including Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., have dismissed scores of investment bankers; analysts
expect other firms to follow suit. Since the 1987
stock-market crash, more than 45,000 jobs have been lost in
the securities industry, according to the Securities Industry
Association.
   The Kidder cost-cutting effort follows a recently
announced $550 million recapitalization plan under which
Kidder agreed to sell its portfolio of risky investments --
including junk bonds, temporary "bridge" loans and
merchant-banking holdings -- for $750 million to GE Capital
Corp., another GE unit. In turn, Kidder will give $200
million to GE Financial Services, the GE entity that controls
Kidder and GE Capital.
   "GE Capital happens to be a very skilled banker, and they
may be doing some of those activities themselves," says James
Hanbury, a Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. analyst. "Hence, there's
less need" for investment-banking staff members.
   Separately, Kidder said it plans to abolish its regional
management system. The firm told staff members Friday that
its four regional managers -- who oversee Kidder's 1,400
stockbrokers and 44 branches -- will be reassigned.
   Steven Goddard, Western region manager, will retire at
year-end; Jack Higgins, head of the New England region, will
resume his activities as a broker; William Kennedy, Eastern
region manager, will be promoted to the newly created post of
senior operating officer of national sales; and Steven
Satkamp, Central region head, will become manager of Kidder's
Chicago branch. Mr. Satkamp succeeds Frank Malone, who will
remain as a managing director and a member of Kidder's
national strategic sales group.
   The shuffle reflects an attempt to run Kidder much as GE
runs itself: with the fewest possible layers of management,
Kidder officials said. Rather than being a full-service firm,
Kidder has been trying to focus on wealthy individuals, small
companies and small institutions.
