   BRASILIA -- Brazil lifted a ban that prevented foreign
multinational companies from remitting profits, dividends or
capital abroad. But remittances that are already frozen will
remain so for 16 months, the central bank said.
   "In the future, those operations won't be subject to
compulsory deposit in the central bank, and companies here
can freely remit resources to their parent firms," central
bank spokesman Pedro Kleiberg said.

   The ban on capital remittances was announced July 3, 1989,
to protect the country's dwindling hard-currency reserves.
   Mr. Kleiberg said the measure applies only to future
operations. The money now on deposit at the central bank --
estimated at about $1 billion -- will be released in 12 equal
monthly installments starting Sept. 16, 1991, he said.
   Separately, Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said
inflation in April was close to 3% a month, and not zero as
the government had predicted.
   Mrs. Cardoso de Mello told senators on Thursday that
President Fernando Collor de Mello's anti-inflation program
called for a drop in inflation to around 10% a month in 100
days.
   "We managed to knock inflation down to 3% in 40 days," she
said. The official inflation rate is to be announced
tomorrow.
