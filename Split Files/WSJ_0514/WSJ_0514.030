   The April 2 page-one article on Eduardo "Danding"
Cojuangco Jr. ("All in the Family: Closest Marcos Crony Is
Favorite to Succeed Aquino in Philippines") ignores three
realities in today's Philippine politics: A presidential
candidate needs a nationwide party machine to win (Mr.
Cojuangco has none), the majority of the Filipino electorate
no longer can be bought and will reject anyone tainted with
the Marcos legacy, and Defense Secretary Fidel "Eddie" Ramos
is now the most popular person in the country and is running
for the presidency in 1992.
   Mr. Cojuangco will have an outside chance of winning only
if he can get himself to head a major-party ticket.

   The Philippines has a very high literacy rate and even in
the remotest "barrios" the people know why the country's
economy is below the level of 25 years ago: Ferdinand Marcos
and his cronies raped the country for more than two decades
and caused the peso to lose 90% of its buying power.
   Filipinos are no different from the East Europeans or
Nicaraguans who just booted out their totalitarian masters.
They will not vote for another regime headed by the very
people who stole the country's wealth and who have remained
unpunished.
   It is in the interest of the U.S. to nurture the growth of
real democracy in the Philippines instead of supporting
people like Eduardo Cojuangco who would promise continued use
of the U.S. military bases in the islands in exchange for
such support. After all, that was Ferdinand Marcos's ploy,
and look what happened.

   You anoint Mr. Cojuangco "the leading candidate" for
Philippine president, apparently excluding even President
Corazon Aquino, who many believe could quite easily be
drafted by popular demand to run again and win. In a call to
the Philippine Embassy, I learned that Mr. Cojuangco hardly
shows in the most recent polls. You fail to cite a single
poll or mention one of many Aquino allies with strong
followings, starting with Defense Secretary Ramos, Foreign
Affairs Secretary Manglapus, Speaker of the House Mitra or
Senate President Salonga.
   You realize chief opposition leader Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
and Vice President Salvador "Doy" Laurel (in spite of his
office) lack significant electoral stature, which polls and
popular sentiment confirm. But your theme that Mr. Cojuangco
has stature flies in the face of credulity and seems based
solely on Mr. Cojuangco's Marcos crony capitalist patronage,
which your research confirms is well known, and a one-sided
exaggeration of Philippine political culture.
