   It's More Than a One-Man Show

   This is a story about a man and his ad agency. About
sun-dappled streams and rolling hills. About wide-eyed
children and their dogs. And about the commercials the man
narrates in a town called San Francisco, in a country we call
America.
   The man is Hal Riney, and his mellifluous voice is
familiar to millions as the folksy drawl behind commercials
for Alamo rental cars, John Deere tractors, Blue Cross/Blue
Shield, and, before that, for Gallo wine and Perrier. His
style is unquestionably the most distinctive in advertising.
Beautifully photographed, sun-filtered shots of majestic
mountains, breathtaking sunsets and small children waving
American flags. . . Mr. Riney's unmistakable voice in the
background, steeped in Americana and bringing a tear to the
eye even when the subject is farm tools.

   Mr. Riney's distinct style, though, has become something
of a millstone around his neck. His agency's ads are so
closely associated with him that some of the staffers doing
the work are frustrated, while outsiders constantly question
whether the shop is viable without him. More than a dozen
creative people have left the Hal Riney &amp; Partners' flagship
San Francisco office in just the past six months, a number of
them disillusioned because no matter what they did, Mr. Riney
somehow got the credit. The small Chicago office recently
lost its two top managers.
   "Unquestionably, the perception is that he is the agency,
so {everyone else} gets lost underneath," says Jeff Atlas, a
former senior writer who left with three other Riney
colleagues earlier this year to form Atlas Citron Haligman &amp;
Bedecarre.
   The perception problem is particularly acute now as the
Riney agency looks to the future. Mr. Riney has steadfastly
denied speculation that he wants to sell his shop. But at 57
years old, he soon must prepare either for a sale or for his
retirement, industry executives say. Yet as of now, no Riney
executives are considered likely successors. While a search
is on to hire a senior executive who might be a contender,
none has been found. The search, what's more, is focusing on
account executives, who wouldn't be able to fill Mr. Riney's
shoes as a creative beacon.
   The problem is compounded because, while other agencies
with top-notch creative reputations have built up creative
"stars" -- executives like Phil Dusenberry at BBDO -- Riney
hasn't. Even hard-core advertising junkies would be
hard-pressed to name Riney's top creative people, such as
Gerald Andelin and Paul Mimiaga. That lack of a star system
for anyone but Mr. Riney makes it difficult to cultivate and
keep strong executives in such an ego-driven business.
   "An organizational chart is usually a pyramid shape. With
Riney, there's Hal -- and everyone else," says Mr. Atlas. As
for finding a new senior executive, he adds, "Someone strong
enough to succeed Hal might not want to work under Hal."
   As far as some clients are concerned, the agency may as
well be a one-man show. Scaling back and paving the way for a
Hal Riney agency without Mr. Riney may prove difficult. One
reason Perrier pulled its account earlier this year, for
example, was because Mr. Riney wasn't spending enough
personal time on the account, executives close to Perrier
say. Mr. Riney couldn't be reached for comment.
   The job of proving that Hal Riney the agency is bigger
than Hal Riney the man falls to the agency's various offices.
Last week, top management of Riney's small New York outpost,
which has been struggling to grow, admitted some frustration.
   "The work that's running now, Hal hasn't written. Hal
never met any of the clients we have here until after we won
the business. He hasn't met Carvel yet," said Jim Travis,
president and chief operating officer of both Riney and its
New York office. And yet, added Helayne Spivak, the office's
creative director, "People say if it's Hal's voice, it must
be his work."
   Perhaps just as disconcerting is that prospective clients
often don't realize that Riney churns out other types of ads,
not just the folksy, patriotic kind narrated by Mr. Riney. So
common have Mr. Riney's trademark down-home ads become that,
in advertising circles, he has already become a living
cliche. "I don't think any agency has as narrow a reputation
-- and as broad a range," Ms. Spivak says.
   Ms. Spivak was brought in last fall from Ammirati &amp; Puris
to spruce up the New York office's creative work. She's been
putting her own stamp on ads and says Mr. Riney hasn't
interfered. True, the office's Mutual of New York commercials
are fairly typical Riney fare, minus Mr. Riney's voice. But
most of the office's other commercials -- like an MTV-style
spot for Fuji audiotape featuring odd people and even odder
sound effects -- don't look much like the Riney stereotype.
   Mr. Travis says the office bills about $45 million, and he
hopes to double that by a year from now. Yet after a spurt of
new business activity a few months ago, the office is quiet
now. Constant, so-far inaccurate, press reports speculating
on a sale, a new president or the departure of Mr. Travis --
who insists he isn't going anywhere -- certainly haven't
helped. Neither has news of the many departures in other
offices, although Mr. Travis says more people were hired than
left. And its Chicago presence is in question as it hunts for
a new manager, although Mr. Travis says the office won't be
shut down.
   The speculation isn't likely to end anytime soon. For one
thing, Mr. Riney has apparently considered selling -- or at
least merging -- his agency before. Several years ago, for
instance, he briefly talked about a three-way merger with
Chiat/Day and Ally &amp; Gargano, Mr. Travis confirmed.
   In the meantime, the Riney organization is working
overtime to prove that, with $225 million in billings, Hal
Riney is more than just a man and a voice. After all, Ms.
Spivak says, "people no longer demand to meet J. Walter
Thompson." She adds, "I don't want people saying, there's
Riney work. I want people to say that's great -- who did that
stuff?"

   Teddy Bear Soup
                                                                                                       

   Campbell Soup this summer will introduce Teddy Bear Soup
as part of a big push to woo kids to its soup franchise.
   In introducing the product, Campbell said it has a renewed
commitment to the children's market. "It's the lost
generation," said Bob Bernstock, who heads up Campbell's soup
business. "We haven't really gone after kids."
   Teddy Bear Soup will come in only one variety, a chicken
broth with pasta cut in the shape of teddy bears.
   The introduction of the soup will be supported by
advertising created by Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi unit. Ads promoting the product will feature an
animated teddy bear dancing with the Campbell "Kids"
characters.

   SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI: John Sharkey, a top Saatchi executive
in Europe, is leaving the agency, Saatchi insiders said. Mr.
Sharkey, who couldn't be reached, was close to ousted Saatchi
executives Roy Warman and Terry Bannister, who until earlier
this month were joint chief executives of Saatchi's ad
division. Mr. Sharkey spent five years at Saatchi before
quitting in late 1988 to join Blue Arrow PLC as chief
operating officer. Following a management coup there, he
rejoined Saatchi last June as deputy chairman of
international advertising operations.
                                                                                                       

   ADS CANCELED: Boston's WHDH-TV said Procter &amp; Gamble
canceled its ads there after the CBS affiliate broadcast an
ad urging consumers to boycott P&amp;G's Folgers coffee. The ad
was produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a national organization
that advocates ending U.S. investments in El Salvador and
urges consumers to boycott coffee containing beans grown in
El Salvador. P&amp;G spends about $1 million annually on ads at
the station. A P&amp;G spokesman said the ad attacks P&amp;G and
Folgers, "and that's not the type of ad environment we want
for our ads."
                                                                                                       

   MILLER RESERVE: Miller Brewing this week will introduce
Miller Reserve, an above-premium beer, in four markets,
including Atlanta and Richmond, Va. Miller says Miller
Reserve, a 100%-barley draft beer, will compete with Michelob
and Heineken. The product will be priced higher than its High
Life and Lite brands. Ads for the new product, developed by
Frankenberry, Laughlin &amp; Constable, Milwaukee, will feature
the theme "The perfect grain. The perfect way to brew it."
                                                                                                       

   ACCOUNTS: Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, Boston, was named
agency for Colombo Inc.'s $4 million refrigerated-products
account. Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor, New York, had
handled the assignment. Ingalls Quinn also picked up a $1
million assignment for a new photo display product from H-B
Group, Norwood, Mass.
                                                                                                       

   MAGAZINE: McCall's magazine awarded its trade ad account
to Holland Advertising, New York.
