   GUNMEN KILLED two U.S. airmen in the Philippines on the
eve of base talks.
   As the U.S. and the Philippines prepared to open
negotiations today on extending the leases on six American
military bases, authorities said suspected leftist guerrillas
killed the two servicemen near Clark Air Base, about 50 miles
north of Manila. The assailants escaped, and there wasn't any
immediate claim of responsibility. But the area near Clark
has been a communist stronghold since the 1940s. The Air
Force ordered all troops back to base, and those living
off-base were restricted to quarters.
