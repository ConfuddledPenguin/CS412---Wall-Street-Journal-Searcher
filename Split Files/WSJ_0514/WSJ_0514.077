   BUENA PARK, Calif. -- Four years ago, the nation's oldest
theme park, Knott's Berry Farm, experimented with change.
   Instead of sticking with the set menu at the park's
Chicken Dinner Restaurant, diners could substitute soup for
the cherry rhubarb appetizer, and apple or peach pie for the
traditional boysenberry pie.
   Outraged letters came pouring in.
   "People were saying, `How dare you tamper with the
original menu]' and we weren't even taking away any of the
old items" recalls a spokesman.
   Such are the bearable headaches of a company that has
built its reputation on being predictable and familiar. A
fortress in its marketplace, the family-owned enterprise year
after year survives direct competition from Disneyland --
less than 10 miles away -- and from other theme parks run by
big companies. Knott's says its profits are at record levels.
   The secret to Knott's longevity has been preserving its
image of "good, old-fashioned fun," says Chairman Terry E.
Van Gorder. The tricky part has been finding ways to make
this "old-fashioned fun" seem refreshing enough so that
arthritis doesn't set in. And in that, Knott's has apparently
succeeded. "They keep adding new things, but they also keep
the old," says Tom Powell, editor of Amusement Business
magazine, a trade publication.
   In many ways, Knott's is the smorgasbord of theme parks,
with indoor rides like at Disneyland, fast rides for
thrill-seekers, a dolphin show to compete with marine parks
and a playland for kids.
   But the centerpiece remains Knott's 50-year-old Ghost
Town. Here, visitors can hop aboard an 1880s steam train, pan
for "real gold" (tiny granules of the stuff) and watch a
simulated shootout.
   It all developed over time to meet market demands. In the
1920s, Walter Knott and his wife, Cordelia, cultivated
berries here and sold them from a roadside stand. Mrs. Knott
in 1934 began serving fried-chicken dinners for 65 cents
each.
   As the number of patrons grew, Mr. Knott toyed with the
idea of building an attraction to keep customers entertained
while they waited in line. Mr. Knott was fascinated by tales
of the Old West, having grown up with stories of his mother's
trek to California in a covered wagon. In 1940, he began
moving old buildings here from various ghost towns. Thus
began the nation's first theme park, so called because it had
the "theme" of the Old West.
   But in 1955, Knott's suddenly faced a formidable neighbor:
Disneyland. That park boasted not only a steam train and
replica of the Old West but four other themed areas as well.
   Knott's gradually incorporated some Disney-style elements
to keep pace. A ride through a simulated mine with animated
figures was added in 1962. A Mexican-themed area opened in
1969, followed in 1975 by a Roaring '20s area. Although
Disneyland inadvertently helped Knott's by bringing
out-of-towners to the area, Knott's never could match
Disneyland's numbers. Over the years, several other rival
amusement parks opened.
   In 1981, the year Mr. Knott died, the Knott family decided
to turn the reins over to someone with more experience in the
amusement park industry. It hired Mr. Van Gorder, who had
been president and chief executive of nearby Magic Mountain
amusement park for eight years, until it was sold to Six
Flags Corp. in 1979. Mr. Van Gorder's challenge was to
attract new customers. "One thing that scared me was the line
of gray-haired people at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. I
thought, `My God, this market is dying.'"
   The solution was to build a new themed area where yuppies
could bring their offspring. In 1983, Knott's opened Camp
Snoopy, a $10 million area with pint-sized rides for
children, themed around the Peanuts cartoon characters, which
Knott's licensed from Charles Schulz.
   Knott's has spent about $60 million on new projects in the
past seven years. Mr. Van Gorder concedes that the
competition outspends Knott's on capital outlays by
eight-to-one, and on marketing by four-to-one. But, he says,
"the last four years by far have been the most successful in
our history" in terms of sales and profits. Attendance has
remained relatively constant over the past several years.
(Knott's declines to disclose specific figures.)
   Now, Knott's plans to do something its bigger competitors
have already done: duplicate itself, but on a small scale.
   A new $70 million park called Knott's Camp Snoopy will be
located inside the new Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
Opening in the fall of 1992, it will have 16 rides and
attractions.
   "Given the cost of land these days, this smaller
vest-pocket park solution makes a lot of sense," Mr. Van
Gorder says. He hopes Knott's can find "more small-park
opportunities in America in the years ahead," and maybe even
go overseas.
   Knott's is expanding its food business as well. Later this
month, it will unveil a new line of low-calorie jams and
jellies made with NutraSweet, the first time the sweetener
has been used in fruit spreads. And Knott's says it will open
two restaurants outside the park next year, called Mrs.
Knott's Restaurant &amp; Bakery.
   Will the old-fashioned Knott's formula play outside Orange
County, Calif.? Mr. Van Gorder is confident it will. "Nothing
about us will be out of fashion or out of date," he says. "In
my opinion, America needs to turn back to its roots. Knott's
is already there."
