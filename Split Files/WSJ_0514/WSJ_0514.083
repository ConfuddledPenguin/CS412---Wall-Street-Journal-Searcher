   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House Republican
whip and conservative guerrilla warrior, has scheduled the
beginning of the next political revolution for Saturday
morning television.
   The combative Georgia Republican, who has been thrashing
about the political bulrushes in an effort to give new energy
to the conservative movement, is taking his battle against
what he calls "the failed programs of the bureaucratic
welfare state and its permissive values" into America's
living rooms this weekend.

   The result is the American Opportunity Workshop, an
hour-long program highlighting local efforts to solve
problems ranging from education to employment. Implicit in
Saturday's show, which includes segments with President Bush
and Vice President Quayle, is the notion that the
big-government programs of the past -- read Democratic
programs -- don't work. "This is not a 30-second attack ad,"
Mr. Gingrich says, "but an effort to change the whole
argument."
   In the process, Rep. Gingrich has managed something of a
political coup: He's packaged his effort to mold a GOP
elective block that he thinks has "one chance in three" of
taking control of the House by 1992 into a television
production that he's marketing as nonpartisan and will be
broadcast nationwide on the Family Channel.
   "This is described as a bipartisan show," complains
Michael McCurry, spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee, "but it's more fulminations from Chairman Newt."
   Although some Democrats, including former Attorney General
Griffin Bell, are involved in the effort, the project has a
strong Republican orientation. The television program, for
example, is sponsored by GOPAC, the political-action
committee that works with Republican state and local
candidates. And it will include five live segments, three
featuring GOP congressmen, one from a Republican meeting in
Portland, Maine, and another featuring Paul Weyrich,
president of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative
think tank.
   Mr. Gingrich has been struggling for more than a year to
give new direction to conservatism and in recent months has
been talking about such ideas as fighting narcotics by
imposing a 10% income penalty for drug use and attacking the
cost of health care by giving tax credits to healthy
Americans and underwriting routine physical examinations. He
has selected third-grade classes in five Georgia public
schools and promised to pay these pupils $2 for every book
they read this summer.
   Rep. Gingrich, who emerged on the national scene as one of
the new anti-welfare-state conservatives, increasingly is
embracing ways to use government efficiently. His view, in
short: The enemy is bureaucracy, not government. "I'm for a
very active government," he says, "not for an active
bureaucracy."
   Mr. Gingrich's brainstorming is being attacked both from
the right and the left.
   "There are times when an efficient government can be worse
than an active, inefficient government," says Doug Bandow, a
senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank
in the capital. "Nobody ever thought that when they were
creating those big government programs they were also
creating a big bureaucracy that would screw everything up.
They thought they had wonderful initiatives that were helping
America."
   Democrats, meanwhile, wonder aloud whether Mr. Gingrich is
well positioned to undertake an assault on Washington's
bureaucracy. "The Republicans have had the White House for
the better part of 30 years, and they've had plenty of chance
to fight the bureaucracy," says Rep. Byron Dorgan of North
Dakota. "The most spectacular waste, fraud and abuse occurred
because they weren't willing to watch carefully enough. The
American people would like to watch good government rather
than a television show."
   The focus of Mr. Gingrich's new offensive is to create a
new political coalition by emphasizing action on the local
level.
   "If we can get people to think about tackling problems at
the local level without running to the statehouse or their
congressman, we can have great success," says Hal Eberle,
executive vice president of the South Carolina Policy
Council, a conservative think tank. "There's a lot of talk
now that Washington is irrelevant, and I think that's great.
Let's dismantle Washington."
   Saturday's television broadcast will focus on individual
efforts such as those undertaken by Polly Williams, the
Democratic state legislator from Milwaukee who fought for
education vouchers for the poor; Luis Garcia, a Southern
Californian who built his construction business with workers
from the barrios; Perry Grogan, a Georgia sheriff who built a
prison at half the expected cost; Douglas Sukeforth, a Maine
machine-products manufacturer who invented a new
refrigeration technology that is an alternative to harmful
refrigerants currently in use; and Chuck Schuntag of
Davenport, Iowa, who created a clearinghouse to help Vietnam
veterans find their companions from the war.
   Local experimentation such as this, Mr. Gingrich says,
"could become the dominant answer for the next 25 years."
   The Gingrich approach calls for local solutions that fall
within a triangle of principles: entrepreneurial free
enterprise, technological progress and what he calls "basic
American values." Some conservatives believe this approach
may rekindle citizen interest in public affairs.
   "I find a lot of frustrated individuals out there," says
GOP state Rep. Robert Ouelette of New Hampshire. "The only
way they can have their voice heard is to protest in front of
city hall or write a letter. This is a way to get people
involved in a movement that can give them impact and power.
This may turn out to be the way to bring the `fundamental
values' people into politics."
   The television broadcast is being accompanied by an
estimated 560 workshops scattered about the country, where
voters will be encouraged to offer local ideas that the
event's planners predict "will define the citizens'
opportunities movement of the 1990s."
   "This is part of the process of thinking through how to
build the next phase of the conservative movement," says
Jeffrey Eisenach, a consultant to GOPAC. "We knew that the
new movement would have to spring from the grass roots up. We
think the way to do this may be to use television. You're
real if you're on the box and you're not real if you're not
on the box."
