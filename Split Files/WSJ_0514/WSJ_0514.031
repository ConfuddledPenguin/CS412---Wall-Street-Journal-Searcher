   TULSA, Okla. -- Unit Corp. said it withdrew its proposed
offering of one million shares of convertible exchangeable
preferred from the market because of "significant common
stock price declines during the registration period."
   The oil and natural gas company said the offering terms
were "excessively dilutive to our existing shareholders and
not consistent with our objectives to manage long-term asset
value."
