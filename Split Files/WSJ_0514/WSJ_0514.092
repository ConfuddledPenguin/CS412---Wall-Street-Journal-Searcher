   HOLLYWOOD -- Flexing the muscles of its new ownership and
management, Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
beat out two rival studios and signed James L. Brooks to an
exclusive contract under which he will write, produce and
direct films and television shows.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but the arrangement, which runs
for seven years, could call for production funding of well
over $100 million.

   Mr. Brooks is a rare, valuable bird in Hollywood. He makes
successful television shows (from the original "Mary Tyler
Moore Show" to the current "The Simpsons") and movies ("Terms
of Endearment" and "Big"). Competition was fierce for tying
up the deal, especially after Capital Cities/ABC Inc. gave
Mr. Brooks a commitment for at least three series in an
arrangement reportedly valued at $30 million. MCA Inc. is
understood to have been in the running up until the end.
   News Corp.'s Fox unit perhaps had the inside track. Mr.
Brooks has worked there for the past six years and has a long
history with Fox's chairman, Barry Diller. But talks with Fox
broke down last week over control of film and TV budgets,
according to individuals close to the situation.
   Mr. Brooks said the key to going to Columbia was creative
freedom. "If push comes to shove, I'll be able to make movies
I believe in -- even if I'm the only one who wants to make
them," he said.
   Recent Hollywood contracts have been astronomical. Film
producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer recently signed a
deal with Paramount Communications Inc. that is likely to
cost the studio from $100 million to $300 million to produce
films, with a hefty percentage of gross profits going to the
producers. Columbia has signed TV writer-producers to deals
paying several million dollars a year.
   Peter Guber, co-chairman of Columbia, first contacted Mr.
Brooks late last year, shortly after Sony installed Mr. Guber
and Jon Peters as heads of the studio.
   "We started pursuing Jim Brooks the minute we arrived at
Columbia," said President Alan J. Levine. Columbia TV
executives had been wooing Mr. Brooks even earlier, and it
was decided that the company go after an "overall" deal.
   Mr. Brooks still owes his next motion picture to Fox, and
"The Simpsons" and "The Tracy Ullman Show" will continue to
be produced there as well. But he will begin work on the
shows for ABC June 1.
   Under the arrangement, Columbia will provide funding for
Mr. Brooks's company, Gracie Films, to hire almost a dozen TV
writers, develop film scripts and pay for production of
movies and TV shows. Gracie Films will collect a fee and keep
a percentage of the profits.
