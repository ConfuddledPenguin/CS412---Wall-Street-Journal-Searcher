the quarter.

   The Hudson, Mass., maker of fiber optic communications
systems attributed the lower revenue to delays in U.S. and
European government programs, lower sales to Pacific Rim
customers and a longer-than-expected purchasing approval
process among some new customers.
   In the second quarter ended July 1, 1989, the company
earned $281,000, or seven cents a share, on revenue of $2.8
million.
   Artel said it has "implemented cost-containment actions
while maintaining the ongoing product development programs."
The company added that it expects to make "significant" new
product announcements by year end.
