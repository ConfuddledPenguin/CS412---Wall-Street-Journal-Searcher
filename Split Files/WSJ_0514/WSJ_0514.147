   SALT LAKE CITY -- American Stores Co. said it is
considering the sale of Buttrey Food &amp; Drug, a division of
its wholly owned subsidiary, American Food &amp; Drug Inc.
   American Stores said the move stems from a need to review
"marginal performing assets" in the wake of litigation by the
California attorney general blocking the merger of its Alpha
Beta markets with Lucky Stores Inc.
