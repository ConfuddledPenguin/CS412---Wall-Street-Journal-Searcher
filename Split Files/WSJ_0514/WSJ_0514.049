   ROME -- Italian authorites said they seized more than 90
tons of components believed to be parts for the alleged Iraqi
super gun.
   At a Saturday news conference, police said they believed
the parts, made in Italy and destined for Iraq, were for the
posterior section of a giant artillery piece. Officials said
the huge gun would be capable of firing rounds hundreds of
miles, including ones with nuclear or chemical warheads.

   Italian law prohibits the sale or shipment of arms to
Iraq. Documents seized along with the components indicate
that the parts were for oil-field equipment ordered by Iraq's
Ministry of Industry.
   Carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police, confiscated the
parts and documents Friday during raids in Terni, Naples,
Rome and Brescia, officials said.
   One of the companies involved is Societa delle Fucine
S.p.A., a steel company based in Terni in central Italy and
owned by the state-owned steel company Ilva S.p.A.. Ilva is
part of the state industrial conglomerate Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale.
   A spokesman for Societa delle Fucine said, "The indication
from the Iraqi ministry was that they were for a
petrochemical plant. It did not seem possible that they could
be used for any suspicious machinery."
   Police said they haven't yet made any arrests.
