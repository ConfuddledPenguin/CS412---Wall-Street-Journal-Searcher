   Unilever N.V., the Anglo-Dutch food and home-products
group, said pretax profit for the first quarter advanced 5.2%
as growth in Europe countered declining profitability in
North America.
   Pretax profit hardened to #366 million ($614.7 million) on
sales of #5.12 billion ($8.6 billion) against pretax profit
of #348 million and sales of #4.55 billion in the comparable
period. The figures were in line with analysts' expectations.

   Interest charges, which more than doubled to #82 million
as borrowings increased to finance acquisitions, ate into
Unilever's profit. Profit after tax and minority interests
firmed 13% to #221 million from #195 million in the first
quarter of 1989. Earnings per share jumped to 12.3 pence a
share from 10.4 pence, a gain of 18%.
   On the Amsterdam stock exchange, investors bid up Unilever
to a high of 144.50 guilders a share Friday before it closed
at 143.90, up 2.60 guilders from the previous finish. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Unilever closed
at $79.75 a share, up $3.
