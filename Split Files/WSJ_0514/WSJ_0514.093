   DENVER -- Colorado National Bankshares Inc. said it
received $1.1 million, after taxes, from its insurer in
settlement of a fraud loss connected to its credit card
operations.
   The bank holding company recorded a $2 million after-tax
charge last year, when a Minneapolis company that processed
merchant sales drafts for Colorado National's 50%-owned
credit-card unit allegedly failed to forward certain payments
to merchants.
