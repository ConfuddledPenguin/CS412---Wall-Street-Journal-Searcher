   KINGSVILLE, Texas -- President Bush set a goal of putting
an American on Mars in 30 years.
   Mr. Bush had previously endorsed a manned mission to Mars,
but hadn't embraced the goal of accomplishing the job in 30
years. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration already had been discussing a timetable of
roughly 30 years, however.

   Mr. Bush, who is busy trying to begin negotiations with
Congress to cut the federal budget deficit, didn't say how
much he thinks it will cost to reach Mars in that time.
   The president declared his goal in a commencement address
here at Texas A&amp;M University. Noting that 20 years have
passed since the first Apollo mission to the moon, Mr. Bush
declared: "Thirty years from now I believe man will stand on
another planet. . . . I believe that before Apollo celebrates
the 50th anniversary of its landing on the moon, the American
flag should be planted on Mars."
