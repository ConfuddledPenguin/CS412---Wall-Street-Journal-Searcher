   COLUMBIA, S.C. -- President Bush, as part of an effort to
show broader American support for nascent democracies in
Eastern Europe, said the U.S. Export-Import Bank is opening a
new line of credit for Poland.
   Mr. Bush said the bank, an independent government agency
that finances exports of American goods, will begin offering
medium-term loans and loan guarantees and medium-term credit
insurance for projects in Poland. Previously, the Ex-Im Bank
was providing only short-term credit insurance, the White
House said.

   Short-term financing generally is extended for only one
year, while medium-term financing can be repaid over roughly
five to seven years, White House officials said. They added
that any new financing for projects in Poland would have to
come out of existing Ex-Im Bank funds, meaning that the
administration won't seek additional funds for the
president's initiative.
   Mr. Bush announced the step at a commencement address here
at the University of South Carolina. He said the move was
part of an American effort to "export our experience" to help
Eastern Europe nations that are shucking their Communist
systems.
   All told, the modest package of initiatives announced by
the president amount to a relatively low-cost attempt to
counter assertions that he hasn't been aggressive enough in
helping Eastern Europe pull away from Soviet control.
   In addition to the new Ex-Im Bank financing, Mr. Bush said
that the U.S. will be sending delegations to observe coming
elections in Romania and Bulgaria and will participate in a
meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe in a few weeks to draw up guidelines on free elections
and political pluralism.
   Mr. Bush also announced the formation of a Citizens
Democracy Corps, which will consist of private-sector
volunteers who will help East Europeans develop democracies
and market-oriented economies. Officials said the
administration will seek $300,000 in government funding to
get the Democracy Corps started.
   The White House didn't say how much new Ex-Im Bank
financing will be available for Poland. The bank's exposure
in Poland now is $52 million, mostly in financing arranged
before 1982.
   Offering new financing is a way for the U.S. to reward and
support Poland's painful decision to put its sagging
socialist economy through "shock therapy" of rapid change
toward a free-market system. U.S. officials want to encourage
other East European nations -- as well as the Soviet Union --
to launch similar programs of radical economic change.
   The new Ex-Im financing will be earmarked primarily for
projects involving Poland's small but growing private sector
or involving state enterprises that have put forth plans to
go private. Mr. Bush said the financing "will provide Poland
a new line of medium-term export credits and loan guarantees
for purchasing machinery, technology and services from
American suppliers."
