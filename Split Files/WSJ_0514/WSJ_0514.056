   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s plan to almost double
the pensions of departing chairman Roger B. Smith and other
top executives is drawing fire from some big shareholders,
with at least one vowing to vote no on the proposal.
   Michigan's state treasurer, Robert Bowman, usually a
supporter of GM management, said Saturday he will vote the
state's 8.8 million GM shares against the plan, which would
increase Mr. Smith's annual retirement pay to $1.2 million.
Mr. Smith is scheduled to retire Aug. 1.

   "We don't think this is the best use of $42 million," Mr.
Bowman said, referring to the estimated $41.6 million total
cost of the pension increases for 3,350 senior GM executives,
including Mr. Smith.
   A GM spokesman said yesterday it wouldn't be appropriate
to comment on Mr. Bowman's voting plans. "Shareholder voting
is up to each individual," he said.
   Mr. Bowman's decision, however, hardly dooms the pension
proposal. Michigan is one of the three biggest GM holders,
but it casts only 1.5% of the total 602 million-share common
stock vote.
   Further, the company's argument that its executive
pensions rank in the bottom 21% of major industrial companies
is winning support from other big shareholders.
   "At a time when the insurance industry is teetering on
junk bonds and the banking system is in disarray. . . . here
is a company that's piled up $10 billion in cash and is a
financial powerhouse," said an official with one large
institutional GM stockholder. This official, who requested
anonymity, added: "If they want to give themselves better
pensions, they probably deserve it."
   GM also got a boost from Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc., a consulting firm that advises many large
institutional investors on how to vote on proxy issues. The
proposal "would serve the purpose of bringing General Motors'
pension benefits up to a par with those of its competitors,"
said Andrew Smith, a senior analyst with the firm, in a
statement Friday.
   Still, the executive pension issue is shaping up to be an
unusually divisive one as GM prepares for its annual
shareholders meeting on May 25. In recent years, GM's
management has had strong support from institutional
investors, who like the company's hefty $3-a-share dividend.
   But several major fund managers said late last week that
they may break with management over the size and timing of
the proposed executive pension increases.
   "We're a little surprised and concerned," said Richard
Koppes, general counsel for the California state retirement
system. Although state pension officials haven't officially
decided how to cast their proxy ballots, "we're leaning
toward voting against it," he said. Earlier this year,
California officials wrote an unusual letter to GM directors
expressing concern about GM's loss of market share in the
U.S.
   Roland MacHold, the director of New Jersey's state pension
fund, called the proposed pension increases "ill-timed."
While Mr. MacHold said he isn't sure how his fund will vote,
he added: "I'm disappointed they'd do this just in advance of
intense labor negotiations {this fall}."
   The company's proposal has infuriated leaders of the
United Auto Workers union. That's because the proposal
undermined the union leadership's effort to blunt a
rank-and-file drive to make cost-of-living raises for
blue-collar pensioners a top demand in bargaining with the
Big Three auto makers this fall. Union leaders share the view
of company officials that putting UAW pensions on a
cost-of-living escalator would cost billions, hurt Detroit's
competitiveness, and deplete resources that might otherwise
go to higher wages and improved job protections.
   Another controversial aspect of the timing is that the
increases are retroactive to Nov. 1, 1989. GM contends it
needs sweeter executive pensions "to improve competitiveness"
and attract top managerial talent. But critics contend that
boosting the pay of those already retired, or about to, won't
contribute to that goal.
   The fact that the oft-controversial Mr. Smith will be one
of the first beneficiaries also is spurring some criticism.
"I don't think Roger Smith is employable anywhere except the
movies," snapped Mr. MacHold, alluding to a recent movie that
posed Mr. Smith as the villain behind the decline of Flint,
Mich.
   The new pension formula outlined in GM's proxy statement
is more lucrative because it includes executive bonuses in
calculating the retirement benefit. Previously, GM pensions
were based solely on salary. But straight salary can be less
than 50% of a GM executive's total direct compensation.
   GM's board could proceed with its plan even in the
unlikely event that a majority of shareholders vote against
it. But the company has assured shareholders that it will
abide by their wishes.
   "I give GM credit for putting it before the shareholders
before the labor negotiations," Mr. Bowman said. Otherwise,
he added, "it would have looked like they were trying to
hoodwink people."
