   TRW Inc., Cleveland, said its TRW Financial Systems Inc.
unit filed a patent-infringement lawsuit in federal court in
Detroit against Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa.
   The TRW suit alleges that Unisys is infringing on patents
covering high-performance image-processing systems that TRW
has licensed to other manufacturers, including International
Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y., and Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, N.Y.

<TEXT>
   Unisys couldn't be reached for comment.
   Image-processing systems handle large volumes of
transaction documents, such as credit-card payments or
utility bill payments.
   TRW is seeking unspecified damages and also wants Unisys
enjoined from further use of the technology TRW contends is
covered by its patents. TRW is an auto parts, aerospace and
defense, and electronics services concern.
