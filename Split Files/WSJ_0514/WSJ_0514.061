   PHILADELPHIA -- In the back of a gray Dodge minivan,
Joseph Karatka sits in a swivel seat gathering intelligence.
Pointing a transmitter into the air, he listens and waits. A
computer screen starts flashing tangerine-colored graphics,
which he quickly deciphers.
   "The competition has turned on their extra spectrum," Mr.
Karatka exclaims. "That wasn't there last week."

   Mr. Karatka pilots the snoop van for Bell Atlantic Corp.'s
Mobile Systems unit. In the high-tech vehicle, equipped with
three antennae, two powerful computers, three cellular
telephones, a facsimile machine and a printer, his daily
mission is to find out how archrival Metrophone's cellular
system compares with Bell Atlantic's.
   "Once, I drove down the Pennsylvania Turnpike measuring
their service quality against ours," says Mr. Karatka. "It
took me the entire day. But we got a lot of good
information."
   Competition for cellular phone service has become so
intense that companies are resorting to more clandestine
tactics and bolder marketing ploys to keep an edge. Some
cellular companies dispatch spies to check on rivals'
merchandise and promotions. All enlist department stores,
electronics retailers and auto supply shops to sell their
cellular phone service along with their equipment. In return,
they offer commissions of $200 to $300 for each customer
contract, up from only about $50 a few years ago.
   The stakes are high for dominance in the cellular market.
Last year, Americans spent nearly $2 billion on cellular
calls. This year, revenue will reach $3.2 billion. Some
locations, such as Los Angeles and New York, are straining to
accommodate the current volume of calls, but with digital
technology facilitating the industry's growth, revenue could
reach $15 billion by 1995, experts say.
   Cellular phone usage is soaring even though basic rates
aren't dropping. Since cellular phone service was first
offered in 1984, the number of mobile phone customers in the
U.S. has surged to 3.5 million. Yet the cost of a cellular
call during peak hours hasn't varied much from current rates
of about 37 cents to 50 cents a minute. (For the average
subscriber, that translates into a monthly bill of about
$100.) By 1998, the number of cellular subscribers will grow
more than sevenfold to 26 million, according to Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   "Growth is phenomenal," says Michael E. Kalgoris, chief
executive officer of Metrophone, a joint venture of McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc. and Metromedia Inc. "That's why
it's so fiercely competitive."
   In their ads, cellular companies make much of their
technological capabilities.
   Nynex Corp.'s Mobile Communications unit boasts that it
has "25% more calling channels than anybody else," making
customers less likely to wait for a line. McCaw promotes its
sophisticated integrated network, which "hands off calls
seamlessly from one cell to the next" and prevents customers
from being dropped in the middle of a call.
   But because they sell essentially similar equipment and
service, cellular companies also are trying to stand out from
one another by dishing up distinctive enticements. Mr.
Kalgoris, for instance, says Metrophone offers customers free
long-distance calling on weekends. Nynex Mobile
Communications is offering free "voice mail" -- a phone
message service -- through the end of May. Until recently,
Chicago-based Ameritech gave away cellular telephones to any
customer who signed a one-year service contract.
   Other companies offer more exotic enticements. Advanced
Telecomm Inc. in Pittsburgh is offering customers two
round-trip tickets to Hawaii, Tahiti or the Bahamas if they
buy a cellular telephone from the company and subscribe to
its cellular service for a year. Vince lo Castro, Advanced
Telecomm's chief executive officer, says the promotion, which
was launched in Philadelphia last month and Washington and
Pittsburgh this month, has nearly doubled sales in some
markets. Even one Bell Atlantic manager admits: "I found
myself considering {the offer} before I came back to my
senses."
   One of the biggest battles among cellular phone companies
is over signing up stores as exclusive distribution agents.
With offers of hefty commissions or advertising and
promotional support, they recruit such chains as Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. and R.H. Macy &amp; Co. to hawk their cellular
phone service to customers who buy cellular phones.
   As an exclusive distribution agent, a retailer receives a
flat commission on every cellular telephone contract sold,
whether it's for 60 days or 39 months. In Chicago, for
instance, Sears salespeople encourage cellular telephone
buyers to sign a service contract with Ameritech Mobile
Communications.
   Retailers often use the commissions to offer deep
discounts on phones. Tops Appliance City, a big retailer in
New Jersey, last month was offering an astoundingly
low-priced portable cellular phone. With a 90-day cellular
contract through Bell Atlantic, a customer could buy the
phone for $67. Tops sold the phone only with the Bell
Atlantic service, but the same set without a contract can
cost $300 to $500 at other stores.
   This marketing practice, known as bundling, has landed
some companies in trouble. Law enforcement agents and
regulators in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, Colorado and
California are looking into the practice. Some regulators now
require cellular companies to state clearly that advertised
discount prices on phone equipment are available only when
consumers enter into a binding service contract. Last month
seven cellular-phone retailers were accused by the Michigan
attorney general's office of using misleading advertisements
in the sale of phone equipment. The companies have agreed to
change their advertising practices.
   "We are particularly concerned about ads for new
technological services {such as cellular phones}, because
consumers may not fully understand the potentially related
costs," says Pennsylvania's attorney general, Ernie Preate
Jr.
   The cellular battle could get even nastier if Federal
Digital Cellular has its way. The Washington, D.C., company
is asking regulators to open up the duopoly structure
originally established by the Federal Communications
Commission to a third cellular phone competitor in each major
market.
   Meanwhile, cellular deregulation is spreading, opening the
way for possible price cuts. California regulators recently
proposed a plan that would allow mobile phone service
companies to adjust rates by as much as 10% without
regulatory permission. About 20 states have stopped setting
rates for cellular companies.
   Despite all the ad promotions, cutthroat enticements and
regulatory scrutiny, Craig McCaw, chairman and chief
executive officer of McCaw, says the cellular marketing
battle is just heating up. "The cellular industry has been so
busy building itself," he says, "that it hasn't engaged in
real marketing yet."
