   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said its Eli Lilly Japan
KK unit charged five Japanese companies with patent
infringement, in a lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court.
   The pharmaceutical concern said the five intend to start
generic operations that would encroach upon the company's
patented cefaclor antibiotic, sold under the name Kefral in
Japan by Lilly licensee Shionogi &amp; Co. Lilly called Kefral
Japan's top-selling pharmaceutical.

   Lilly sells the cefaclor product in the U.S. under the
name Ceclor.
   In an industry where intellectual-property fights are
commonplace, Lilly is considered among the most aggressive in
using litigation to protect its patents.
   Lilly Japan KK's suit names Sakai Yakuhin, Tokyo; Ichikawa
Kagaku Kenkyusho, Osaka; Taiyo Yakuhin Kogyo, Nagoya; MF
Seizei Kenkyusho, Tokyo; and Toyo Shinyaku, Aichi Prefecture.
   Lilly said it has notified several drug concerns, "who are
preparing to launch generic Cefaclor products, of the
effective coverage of our patents." But the five named
companies "are continuing their preparation," Lilly said.
   The suit seeks to have the companies prevented from
"importation/manufacture of bulk Cefaclor or production of
final products."
