   LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered
Summit Health Ltd. to pay a former internal auditor $2.6
million for wrongful termination.
   The auditor, Ronald Kaufman, had sued the Burbank, Calif.,
health-care company, saying he was fired in 1985 after
uncovering what he believed were financial irregularities. He
had worked there for 2 1/2 months.

   Mr. Kaufman, who was director of internal audit, told
then-president William Pierpoint that the company was
overstating its profit and wasn't posting adequate reserves
for accounts receivable, according to the complaint. He
requested additonal employees to perform a detailed audit,
and later predicted in a deposition that the company would
need to take a charge of between $8 million and 15 million.
   Mr. Pierpoint and company management ignored Mr. Kaufman's
warnings, Mr. Kaufman's attorney Timothy Wheeler said, partly
because they were making an $80 million junk-bond offering
later that year. The next year, the company wrote down $13.2
million.
   Judd Osten, Summit's senior vice president for legal
affairs, said the 1986 write-down had nothing to do with Mr.
Kaufman's findings, but with a change in Medicare payment
procedures affecting the whole health-care industry. He said
Mr. Kaufman was fired because "his work was superficial." Mr.
Osten said the company, which had rejected a $500,000
settlement three years ago, hadn't decided whether to appeal.
