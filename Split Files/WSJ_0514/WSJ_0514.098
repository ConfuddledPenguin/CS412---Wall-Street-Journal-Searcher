   NEW YORK -- Initial public stock offerings are picking up,
although their volume still pales in comparison with the
heady days before the 1987 stock-market crash.
   There are signs of life on a broad front: A handful of new
technology issues are the darlings of the season. There has
been a spate of "reverse LBOs" -- with mixed results -- by
companies returning to the public market after the leveraged
buy-outs of years past.

   Energy companies have fueled new interest, as have some
medical technology (but not biotechnology) companies. Public
offerings of foreign stocks may be coming into vogue,
investment bankers say.
   "Only the better deals are going public" nowadays, says
Robert Natale, editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Emerging and
Special Situations newsletter. Many issues seem to be priced
more moderately than in precrash days.
   So far this year 71 companies have made their initial
public offerings, up from 46 last year, according to
Securities Data Co. The total market value of these companies
going public rose to $2.5 billion from $1.4 billion. (The
figures don't include initial public offerings of investment
funds.)
   Companies going public are, on average, smaller than in
the pre-crash era.
   "We're seeing a decent flow of business," says Sorrell
Mathes, managing director in charge of equity origination for
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He says the first four months
of 1990 rank as the fourth-most active year for initial
public offerings since 1982, excluding the publicly traded
investment companies known as closed-end funds.
   "I don't see any areas that are just dead," Mr. Mathes
says. "I've always thought and continue to think that the IPO
market is a subset of the general market. Industries which
are considered to be a good place to invest are a good place
to do" initial public offerings.
   Fleer Corp. may give investors something to chew on next
month when the Philadelphia maker of baseball cards and
Dubble Bubble gum goes public to pare debt it amassed last
year in a leveraged buy-out. Fleer is one of the more
promising "reverse LBOs" to appear on the initial public
offering landscape this year, analysts say. As companies
taken private during the era of leveraged buy-outs mature,
more of them will come to the public stock markets in search
of debt relief, according to investment bankers.
   This year's round of reverse leveraged buy-outs has been a
mixed bag, Mr. Natale points out, with many companies going
public at the low end or below their anticipated price range.
   Safeway sold a 10% stake to the public at $11.25 a share,
22% below the midpoint of the previously estimated range of
$13 to $16. Pinkerton went public at $14 a share; its
anticipated price was $14 to $16 a share.
   Geneva Steel went public in March at $10 a share, well
below the initially promoted range of $14 to $16 a share.
   But S&amp;P's Mr. Natale says Fleer may be more successful.
   Once a family-owned company, Fleer was purchased in August
in a leveraged acquisition by Charterhouse Equity Partners,
according to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., sole
underwriter of the planned initial public offering. Fleer
plans to offer 1.7 million shares to the public in early June
at $11 to $13 each to reduce debt. Debt was $31.3 million and
equity was $34.6 million on March 31.
   The deal's structure appeals to Mr. Natale. "Their debt
will be less than half of the committed capital after the
offering," he says. At a midpoint of $12 a share, Fleer's
shares would go public at slightly more than 11 times Mr.
Natale's estimated 1990 earnings of $1.05 a share.
   The analyst also likes the fact that Fleer is going public
at a discount to the valuation of its closest rival,
baseball-card maker Topps Co. Fleer should reach the public
at 13 times trailing 12-months earnings and one times
revenue, he says, compared with Topps' trading price of 17
times trailing earnings and 2.6 times revenue. Although Topps
has higher profit margins than Fleer, the latter's
baseball-card sales are growing at a faster rate, he adds.
   While reverse leveraged buy-outs may be emerging as a
trend, "the technology deals are catching the wave," says Mr.
Natale. Specialty companies that fill niches in
telecommunications and computer technology are doing well.
For instance, Telebit, a Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of modems
for sending data over telephone lines, closed Friday at 12
1/4; it went public April 26 at $10 a share.
   Aspect Telecommunications, a San Jose, Calif., maker of
transaction processing systems, went public May 2 at $14.50 a
share, above the anticipated range of $11 to $13 a share. It
closed Friday at 15 3/4.
   Investment bankers say more international companies may be
coming to the U.S. equities markets for capital. Mr. Mathes
of Merrill Lynch points to Luxottica Group, an Italian maker
of eyeglass frames that went public in January at $19 for
each American depositary receipt. Luxottica's ADRs closed
Friday at 23 3/4.
   New issues of biotechnology companies have given way to
offerings of medical technology and service concerns.
Pharmacy Management Services, a Tampa, Fla., provider of
medical cost-containment services, closed Friday at 17 1/2,
up from an April offering at $12 a share.
   Sullivan Dental Products, a West Allis, Wis., marketer of
dental supplies, ended the week at 16, well ahead of its
$10-a-share initial public offering in mid-April. On the
other hand, Tokos Medical, a provider of home-health-care
services, closed at 9 1/2, down from an initial public
offering at $12-a-share in late March.
   Among new energy companies are three oil and gas
exploration and production concerns that are trading below
their offering prices of more than two months ago. Cabot Oil
&amp; Gas, 14 5/8, went public at $16.75 a share; Hadson Energy
Resources, 10 3/4, was offered at $13; and Santa Fe Energy
Resources, 17, was issued at $18.25.
   Faring better is an oil and gas service company, Pool
Energy Services, at 13 1/4, up from its offering price of 10
1/4 in mid-April. Other new energy-service companies include
Teppco Partners, 18 7/8, down from a $20-a-share offering
price; and Tuboscope, 8 1/8, off its initial public offering
price of 8 1/2.
   Analysts and investment bankers say they expect the
initial public offering business to remain steady, ending the
year slightly stronger than 1989. Of course, they add, this
year's demand can't compare with 1987, when Mr. Natale
calculates there were 337 new issues at $5 a share or higher,
valued at a total of $23 billion. But given today's more
sober environment, "the new issues market is doing reasonably
well," he says.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The over-the-counter market surged Friday on optimism over
interest rates.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 4.90, or 1.13%, to
438.10. Advancing stocks outpaced decliners, 1,203 to 723, as
volume rose to 167.5 million from 142.5 million.
   McCaw Cellular Communications rose 2 3/4 to 26 1/4. Smith
Barney, Harris Upham repeated its "buy" recommendation on the
stock, citing strong growth in subscribers to the
long-distance carrier, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
said.
   National Data plunged 9 1/2 to 14 1/4. The Atlanta
data-processing company said it expects to report a loss for
the fourth quarter ending May 31 of eight cents a share,
compared with year-earlier net income of 53 cents a share.
