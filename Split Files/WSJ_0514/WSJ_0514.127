   Metallgesellschaft AG said group pretax profit and group
sales both climbed 10% in the first six months of fiscal 1990
from a year earlier.
   Group pretax earnings at the West German metals concern
climbed to 224 million marks ($136.9 million) in the first
half of the year ending Sept. 30, while sales firmed to 9.8
billion marks, Chairman Heinz Schimmelbusch said at the
annual shareholder meeting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Schimmelbusch traced the better results to the group's
restructuring efforts, which have helped to reduce its
sensitivity to the fluctuations in metals prices. But he
declined to make a profit forecast for the full year.
