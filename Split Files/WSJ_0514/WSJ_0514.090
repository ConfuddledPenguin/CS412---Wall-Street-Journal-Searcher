   Three weeks ago in Tokyo, Max C. Chapman Jr., head of the
U.S. operations of giant Nomura Securities Co., asked his
bosses for a Nomura lapel pin that all Japanese employees
wear.
   He was refused. The Japanese informed him the pin was
reserved solely for employees of the Tokyo parent company.

   The incident illustrates some of the hurdles Mr. Chapman
faces in trying to build Nomura's sleepy U.S. brokerage unit
into a first-rate investment bank.
   Nomura's appointment of the 46-year-old American
investment banker, once the president of Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co., is something of a first. Japanese industrial companies
have put Americans in charge of their U.S. units, but never
before has a major Japanese financial concern handed active
control of its U.S. units to a "gaijin."
   "It's the ultimate experiment in the financial world
today," said Peter Chepucavage, general counsel of Nomura
Securities International Inc., the formal name of the U.S.
operations. "It's an amazing thing. The most Japanese of all
Japanese institutions picked the most American of all the
Americans."
   Though Nomura officials so far talk of Mr. Chapman with
enthusiastic admiration, some people fear his no-nonsense
personality is destined to clash with traditional Japanese
management style. In his first six months as co-chairman of
the U.S. unit, he certainly hasn't acted like someone who
worries much about upsetting the home office.
   "One of the first things I said when I got here was that
meetings will be conducted in English, and if not, I'm not
going to attend," Mr. Chapman said. "We're attempting to
build a permanent American staff here that can interface with
the Japanese, but not to look to those Japanese to be the
movers or the leaders in terms of this market."
   In all this and more, Mr. Chapman's bosses in Tokyo have
backed him. Earlier this month, Nomura's directors voted to
add Mr. Chapman to their group. If shareholders approve his
nomination in late June, as they are expected to do, the son
of a U.S. Marine Corps officer will be the first non-Japanese
to sit on the 40-member board of Nomura, the world's biggest
securities firm.
   In some respects, Mr. Chapman will fit right in. He is
highly disciplined, a trait the Japanese like. He maintains
an athletic six-foot build through regular exercise, and his
weight of 200 hasn't varied by more than three pounds in 20
years.
   Despite its wealth, marketing prowess and dominant
position in Tokyo, Nomura has stumbled badly in the U.S.
   Of the estimated $1.5 billion in world-wide profit Nomura
earned in the fiscal year ended March 31, the contribution
from New York, the world's biggest capital market, was an
inconsequential $20 million, or 1.3%. The prior year, Nomura
lost $15 million in the U.S.
   But many see Mr. Chapman's job as not only to fix New
York, but also to help secure Nomura's commanding position in
the Tokyo market.
   There, Nomura must defend its turf against competing U.S.
firms that are more technologically advanced. This battle
comes at a critical juncture. The Tokyo stock market, where
Nomura is by far the largest brokerage house and where it
earns the bulk of its profit, has slid more than 19% this
year. And analysts project Nomura's profits could shrink as
much as one-third next year if conditions don't improve.
   A key question is how much autonomy Nomura will give Mr.
Chapman. Tokyo policies have several times cost its U.S. unit
profits and prestige. And while Nomura has hired Americans in
the past, often at fat salaries, it has ended up firing some
and watching others jump ship, frustrated with the rigidities
of Japanese management.
   "There is the bureaucratic inertia that results from a
system that is purely consensus management, a society that
avoids situations where anybody has to be embarrassed," said
Robin S. Koskinen, vice chairman of First Chicago Capital
Markets Inc. and a former executive at Nomura's U.S. unit.
"And one way to avoid embarrassment is to avoid making
decisions."
   Successful in bringing U.S. companies to Japan and Europe
to raise money, Nomura "always had trouble taking that to the
next step, to becoming an investment bank in the U.S. for
U.S. companies. To compete with a Morgan Stanley, a Merrill
Lynch and a Goldman Sachs is hard," said Donald Rigoni, a
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and a
former Nomura employee. He added, "Nomura's strength
continued to be overly focused on the Japanese connection."
   Mr. Chapman sees his mission as changing that Japanese
orientation. "What I've been asked to do is build a company,
a sizable company that is sufficiently profitable to make a
contribution to Nomura, one that isn't tied to Tokyo."
   He also needs people, and he has gone on a hiring binge.
In March, he won a 48-hour tug of war with Kidder for the
services of Joseph R. Schmuckler, a computer program-trading
expert. At Nomura, Mr. Schmuckler will set up a program
trading unit that will allow investors to trade big baskets
of stocks around the world.
   This hiring victory was extra sweet for Mr. Chapman. He
had spent his entire career at Kidder, rising to president.
He resigned in February 1989 when he was passed over for
chief executive officer of Kidder's parent, a unit of General
Electric Co. Some Kidder executives say Mr. Chapman lost out
because he wasn't willing to pare down Kidder in light of
Wall Street's post-crash woes. The man who beat him out for
the top Kidder job, Michael Carpenter, personally tried and
failed to dissuade Mr. Schmuckler from changing firms.
   Mr. Chapman and Nomura executives initially became
acquainted three years ago when the big Japanese broker
considered purchasing 40% of Kidder from GE. The talks
collapsed following the October 1987 stock market crash.
   If there is one person responsible for Mr. Chapman's
hiring, it is Katsuya Takanashi, co-chairman of Nomura's U.S.
unit. Nomura executives in Tokyo say Mr. Takanashi believes
the giant firm must expand abroad or shrink. His biggest
challenge, they say, is persuading the rest of Nomura's board
to go along. Domestic business now accounts for roughly 87%
of the firm's bottom line.
   Arriving in the U.S. three years ago, Mr. Takanashi
quickly recognized that "only by exploiting inefficiencies do
you achieve profits" in the highly efficient, competitive
American market. But, Mr. Takanashi added, "it's very
difficult for outsiders to find these inefficiencies. It was
essential to have in the core management of Nomura America
somebody who was very experienced in the U.S. market."
   But with potential conflict at almost every turn, it won't
be easy. For example, Nomura isn't used to putting up a lot
of its own money to do business. "Nomura has been spoiled by
its Japanese retail business {dealing with individual
investors}, where it doesn't have to take big risks," said
Mr. Koskinen, the former Nomura executive. "As a consequence,
it is risk-averse because it has never had to commit capital
to its businesses."
   According to people close to him, the backbone of Mr.
Chapman's strategy for transforming an ineffectual U.S.
brokerage firm into a first-class investment bank is to
capitalize on two budding trends: the internationalization of
U.S. business and the need to reduce the large debt load of
U.S. companies. Mr. Chapman, these people say, wants to turn
Nomura into a firm that can provide midsized U.S. companies
with the funds and contacts to expand their business
globally.
   Another aspect of his strategy is the ability to deal in
so-called derivative products such as futures and options,
which complement the cash markets in stocks and bonds. While
U.S. competitors such as Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon
Brothers Inc. have long offered these services to their
clients, Nomura has lost business in the U.S. because it
wasn't as proficient in these areas.
   Among the hurdles Mr. Chapman faces is anti-Japanese
sentiment in the U.S. among customers, competitors and
politicians. To some extent, his all-American demeanor and
reputation in the financial world may offset such feelings.
   "He's tough as nails when he has to be. He exemplifies
leadership, says what he has to say," said Martin Davis,
chairman and chief executive of Paramount Communications Inc.
"With clients he tells you what you have to know, not
necessarily what you want to hear, which is extremely
important and in some cases a rarity."
   In the early 1980s, Nomura's U.S. unit grew at a measured
pace, its chief goal to become a primary dealer in U.S.
government securities, an elite group of banks and securities
firms that deal directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
   But in mid-1986 when it realized it was well on its way to
becoming a primary dealer, Nomura began biting off more than
it could chew in the U.S. Trying to enter any market where it
believed it could make money, Nomura made mistakes on
personnel, strategy and committed too early to markets before
it could operate effectively in them.
   In the last half of 1986, the staff doubled to roughly
600. Then after the 1987 crash, Nomura reversed gears and
laid off about 20% of its U.S. staff, especially people
involved in sales and trading of U.S. stocks.
   Nomura has had a hard time cracking key U.S. markets. When
the firm first tried its hand at corporate finance in the
U.S., staff members were given lists of U.S. corporations to
call. Each night they had to report back to Tokyo, said
Sumiko Ito, a principal at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. who used
to work at Nomura's U.S. unit. These were hard-sell tactics
that had proved so successful in selling stocks to Japanese
individual investors. The technique didn't work with U.S.
multinational corporations interested in innovative
financings.
   In November 1986, Nomura tried for the first time to be a
lead underwriter in the U.S. It underbid all competitors for
a $250 million GE bond issue. The deal was a disaster. The
market turned against the firm, and Nomura's Tokyo
headquarters reneged and dumped its commitment to sell $125
million of the GE bonds back on New York.
   Days later, Nomura was offered the chance to co-lead
manage a $150 million bond issue for J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Again,
the firm blew an opportunity to enter the big leagues. Shaken
by the GE fiasco, senior Japanese executives were afraid even
to call headquarters in Tokyo to inform it about the deal,
and they instructed Americans to tell Morgan that no one was
available to make a decision.
   "I was dumbfounded," said a former employee. "The
Americans threw up their hands in despair and dismay over the
whole thing."
   The frustrations sometimes broke out into the open. In
early 1986, five Americans, upset at their Japanese
superiors, went on a two-day strike. They called themselves
the River Kwai Five after the movie "Bridge on the River
Kwai," in which Japanese soldiers force British prisoners of
war to build a bridge, only to see it destroyed.
   Mr. Chapman isn't unaware that many regard Nomura as the
Japanese firm most resistant to outsiders. While driving to
work, Mr. Chapman takes Japanese lessons from his secretary.
Still, he conceded, "I am an American. There's no way, no
matter how much I try to learn the language, that I'm going
to be Japanese, look like a Japanese, think Japanese."
   Mr. Chapman is taking such things in stride, mindful of
the unprecedented opportunity that has come his way. "It was
a difficult decision {for Nomura} to give up the proverbial
keys to the kingdom, to cross the Rubicon," he said. But he
quickly added, "I am more than a noble experiment. They made
a commitment that they need strong local management."
