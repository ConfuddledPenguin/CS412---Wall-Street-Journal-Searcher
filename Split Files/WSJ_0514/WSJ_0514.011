   In September 1987, an expectant Chinese couple temporarily
residing in the U.S. received a note from a factory back home
where the wife worked. It wasn't a baby shower invitation.
   The Walfantia Bearing Factory warned the couple that their
pregnancy was unauthorized and that everyone from "the
factory director . . . to the cadres in charge of the birth
control program" would be punished if the baby was born.
Because the "consequences for you are unthinkable," the
factory authorities ominously warned, "you should . . . fix
your problem any way you can. You must not delay] If you have
real difficulties, return to China immediately for an
abortion. . . ."

   This international direct-mail program is just one of the
dark aspects of the Chinese Communist Party's ferocious
population-control effort, and just one of the grim details
John Aird, the Census Bureau's former authority on China,
provides in "Slaughter of the Innocents" (The American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 191 pages,
$16.95).
   Far from being a blessed event, nearly every birth in
China is viewed with a jaundiced eye because it might violate
the population policy, which evolved during some 30 years
after Mao Tse-tung broke with traditionally optimistic
Marxist thinking on large populations.
   "It is a very good thing that China has a big population,"
Mao wrote in 1949. "Of all the things in the world, people
are the most precious." But as the utopian vision of a
communist Promised Land faded away, Mao was less prepared to
let a thousand flowers bloom. By 1955 he was warning that
unfettered population growth could lead to the "extinction"
of the Chinese race.
   Thus he set in motion a program to help the Chinese
overcome their "feudal mentality" and "conservative tendency"
toward large families and adopt "birth plans." Yet even under
Mao's iron fist, birth-control efforts in China during the
1950s and 1960s were fairly mild.
   Then in the 1970s a new anti-natalist campaign required
local authorities to make planned parenthood and birth
control part of the "class struggle." Opponents became (and
today remain) "class enemies," Mr. Aird writes, and Beijing's
birth directives grew increasingly more draconian. In 1979,
with China's population taking a great leap forward, the
authorities explicitly defined the state's interest: zero
population growth by the year 2000.
   Mr. Aird convincingly shows that China's government has
been willing to do just about anything to reach that goal,
justifying their efforts with the neo-Malthusian idea that
people inhibit economic growth. That Hong Kong supports a
vastly denser population is clearly of no interest to
functionaries pursuing an economic system that is in fact
directly responsible for China's woes. "Whether we can
strictly control population growth," Mr. Aird quotes the
People's Daily, "will directly determine whether we can
smoothly achieve our economic development objectives." And so
the Forbidden City's geriatric potentates prohibit "early
marriages, early births" and decree forced sterilization and
compulsory abortion. "Use whatever means you must," Deng
Xiaoping urged in 1981, "but do it."
   Far from stopping at huge fines and cutting off a family's
water and electricity supply for begetting an unauthorized
child, the Communist Party has outlawed removing an
intrauterine device. And while pregnant Chinese nationals
living abroad receive letters urging abortions, women on the
home front are treated to "study classes" and
"heart-to-heart" talks during which birth control cadres
press them into an abortion, followed by IUD insertion or
sterilization.
   Doctors now storm through villages on abortion and
sterilization raids. To preserve the "happy peace" that
state-sponsored birth-control efforts bring to the people,
Mr. Aird writes, China has even "destroyed infants by
injections of alcohol into the fontanel" and by stuffing
gauze into their mouths.
   The population control lobby will no doubt condemn
"Slaughter of the Innocents" not only for the beam it shines
on China's program, but also because Mr. Aird attacks this
group in the book's opening chapter. Even as Chinese
authorities committed mass infanticide, the United Nations
Population Fund enthusiastically bestowed awards and money on
a program it averred was "totally voluntary." Others less
sanguine about China's zealous quest merely call the program
"aggressive" or "rigorous."
   But as recently as last year, China permitted the
publication of articles demanding coercive sterilization and
compulsory abortion for all women under 24, all second
pregnancies spaced less than five years after the first and
all third pregnancies.
   John Aird deserves acclaim not only for his painstaking
academic research on a difficult subject, but also for
dispassionately exposing China's brutal methods. The question
is whether the population control movement that has
championed China's model will learn something from it.
