   Though I am not of Lithuanian ancestry, I am revolted by
Irving Kristol's April 11 editorial-page article, "Bush Is
Right About Lithuania," purporting to demonstrate the
hopelessness of Lithuania's independence drive. The article,
and the fact that it appeared in The Wall Street Journal of
all places, no doubt is as cheering to the Kremlin as it is
depressing for the embattled Lithuanians.
   Mr. Kristol states he is confused by Mikhail Gorbachev's
policies and actions with regard to Lithuania. I don't find
them confusing. They change by the moment because Mr.
Gorbachev is a consummate opportunist and politician who
subscribes to communist ideology. Thus, he will do whatever
it takes to achieve the desired results (maintaining Soviet
power as well as his own) while not disturbing the balance of
power within the various factions of his own government or in
the West.

   Most offensive is Mr. Kristol's assertion that "Lithuania
is not a lucky country" and the conclusion that independence
is impossible for "the foreseeable future," as if "luck" had
anything to do with the principles that should guide American
actions toward a small nation that so closely shares our
ideals.
   The desperate state of the Soviet economy and growing
unrest in other parts of the Soviet empire imply that no one,
certainly not Mr. Kristol, knows what will happen there.
There are a number of scenarios under which Lithuanian
independence is not only possible, but probable. One of them
is the scenario under which Lithuania receives strong moral
and diplomatic support from the West.

   I was stung by Mr. Kristol's article. As a recent
Lithuanian-American traveler and business consultant in the
U.S.S.R., I am highly motivated to respond:
   First, his comparison of Vietnam to Lithuania is
ludicrous. In Vietnam there was a civil war between opposing
factions. Lithuania had enjoyed centuries of independence
prior to the Soviet takeover of its sovereignty.
   Second, Mr. Gorbachev did not "incite the Lithuanians to
declare their independence from the U.S.S.R." -- they have
sought independence for decades, including seven years of
freedom fighting from 1945 to 1952.
   Third, the Soviet Constitution, Article 17, states the
right of any republic to withdraw from the U.S.S.R. through
democratic means, which is exactly what Lithuania did.
   Last, but most important, Lithuania is, in fact, a lucky
country -- a very lucky country -- with a rich history; a
colorful, peaceful culture; one of the oldest, most beautiful
languages in the world; and 3.7 million peace-loving, proud,
industrious people who have survived much stress and
persecution.

   In regard to Mr. Kristol's article:
   1. Although "no nation has ever recognized a right of
secession," since when has the U.S. or any other
freedom-loving country recognized a "right of forced
belonging"? Remember -- the Baltics were invaded and forcibly
absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   2. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are not part of the
"centuries-old Russian empire." Only for the past 50 years
have they been forced to be part of the U.S.S.R.
   3. Lithuania is not a "lucky" country because insensitive,
uncaring and so-called rationalizing intelligentsia such as
Mr. Kristol will not give it support.
