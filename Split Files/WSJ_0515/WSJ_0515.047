   Campaign reform is on the floor of Congress this week. The
Senate majority leadership is proposing a package deal:
limits on the amount of money candidates for Congress may
spend, and public financing of the expenditures candidates
are permitted.
   It all sounds very fair, but in fact, the legislation
grossly favors incumbents -- even more so since Sens. Tim
Wirth (D., Colo.), Tom Daschle (D., S.D.) and Max Baucus (D.,
Mont.), among others, pressured the leadership into fiddling
with the reform's rules over the past few weeks. As well as
the unfortunate intended effects, the bill will have
unfortunate unintended effects -- effects that are bound to
hurt almost every state, in one election or another.

   Spending ceilings are among the most enduringly popular of
campaign reform proposals. In 1974, Congress enacted ceilings
for both presidential and congressional campaigns. The
constitutionality of the statute was challenged, and the
Supreme Court held, in a 1976 case, Buckley v. Valeo, that
while statutory limits on individual contributions to
campaigns are constitutional, limits on spending are not. The
court did, however, permit Congress to require candidates to
comply with spending limits as a condition of public funding
for their campaigns. As a result, presidential candidates --
who are eligible for public funding -- are generally subject
to spending limits, but congressional candidates are not.
   Whatever the consequence of spending limits for
presidential races, congressional elections would become not
more competitive, but less. The more competitive the race,
the more likely it will involve high spending.
   Between 1982 and 1988, there were 30 highly competitive
(6% margin or closer) Senate races and 65 landslides (20%
margin or greater). In the 30 highly competitive races, more
than 60% of the candidates spent more than the various
proposals for campaign reform now before Congress would
permit -- even before adjusting for inflation. But in the
landslides, only 15% of the candidates involved spent more
than the proposals before Congress would permit. The proposed
limits -- which would come into effect in time for the 1992
elections -- would therefore have made little or no
difference in the uncompetitive races, but would have had a
substantial impact on the others.
   Spending limits would alter the balance of power in the
Senate between those states that happened to have competitive
elections in any particular year and states that didn't.
Incumbents in competitive states would be held back from
taking advantage of their great fund-raising edge, while
their challengers would have sufficient public funds to mount
strong races. Those states would probably see unprecedentedly
high turnover of senators, who would accordingly build little
seniority. This would cost their states bargaining power in
Congress. In contrast, uncompetitive states' incumbents, with
their spending untouched by the law would continue to drown
challengers.
   Does anyone want to increase the rewards to one-party
states? Does anyone want another manipulable tool in
incumbents' hands to foil challengers, in the House as well
as the Senate? Of the 12 challengers who beat incumbent
senators between 1982 and 1988, 10 spent more than
now-proposed limits, often between two and six times as much.
   Spending limits would have another perverse impact: They
would ensure that state population size would, for the first
time as a matter of law, affect the outcome of Senate races.
So far, every formula proposed for setting spending limits
state by state has treated population as the only variable
differentiating the cost of politics in one state from
another. But some states have lively general elections,
others only lively primaries; some have expensive media,
others not; and so on. The spending ceilings proposed in
1977, the first time Congress tried seriously to enact them,
were so high in the biggest states that Senate races there
would have been untouched by the law. In contrast, in the 26
smaller states, severe reductions in spending would have been
required.
   This is not to say flatly that spending ceilings cannot
work: the -- now discarded -- March report by the advisory
panel on campaign finance named by Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell and Minority Leader Robert Dole, called for
"flexible" ceilings. That report is the first even
quasi-official recognition that by imposing ceilings, we
raise "valid practical considerations of whether certain
categories of candidates (challengers v. incumbents), parties
(Republican v. Democratic) or campaigns (large state v. small
state) would be advantaged or disadvantaged"; further, that
the formula for ceilings "need{s} to reflect the
disproportionate costs of running in less populated state and
in those states which require advertising in adjacent state's
media markets."
   But I do say that Buckley was right in putting red flags
in front of spending ceilings. First, they're horrendously
hard to set fairly and flexibly enough, as indicated above.
Second, given that difficulty, it is especially significant
that if we have ceilings, they will be set not by a troop of
Eagle Scouts, but by incumbents who will pick the formula and
the level of the limits, and render themselves even more
invulnerable at the same time they claim applause for
"reform." As Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.), a backer of campaign
reform, says, this "appears very hypocritical."
