   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Three thousand investors who gathered
here last week got an earful from investment advisers in two
camps: those who are bullish now, and those who expect to be
bullish in a year or two.
   Among the immediate optimists is Donald Rowe, editor of
Wall Street Digest, who expects the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to hit 3150 by year end and 10,000 by the end of the
decade. Yesterday, the DJIA closed at 2821.53.

   Typical of the "delayed bulls" is James B. Stack, editor
of InvesTech Market Analyst, who said: "I am bullish on the
1990s. It's the next 12 to 18 months I'm very nervous about."
   Here's a sampling of opinion from the conference known as
the Las Vegas Money Show, sponsored by Investment Seminars
Inc.
   Charles Allmon, money manager and editor of Growth Stock
Outlook, drew some of the biggest crowds. "I think the stock
market today is as dangerous as it was in 1987," he told
listeners.
   The market "is not cheap," he argued, because stock prices
are perilously high compared with companies' sales and with
book value, or assets minus liabilities. The book value of
the Dow industrials is about 1750, he noted, and "in the last
three recessions the Dow sold below book."
   Mr. Allmon expects a recession within the next couple of
years, perhaps spurred by spreading real-estate woes. He
predicts that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will fall to
between 1000 and 1500. But then he expects "the greatest boom
this country has ever seen," with the Dow industrials rising
to 6000 (and the public enthusiastically joining in when the
average crosses 4000).
   Detractors criticize Mr. Allmon for holding too much cash
ever since 1986. But he isn't in any mood to back down:
Currently he is about 80% in cash and proud of it. And even
his critics generally concede that Mr. Allmon is a shrewd
stock picker.
   At workshops, he provided a long list of recommended
stocks, among them American International Group,
Carter-Wallace, Clorox, Hershey Foods, Longs Drug Stores, and
New Plan Realty Trust.
   In response to investors' questions, Mr. Allmon also had
some unvarnished comments on stocks he's avoiding. On
International Business Machines: "No thank you. There are too
many good companies around. IBM has had its day." On TCBY
Enterprises: "I love their yogurt, but I don't like the price
of the stock." On Philip Morris: "I think Philip Morris could
be the turkey of the 1990s." The anti-smoking movement is
"picking up steam," in Europe and in the U.S., so Philip
Morris is "going to be left with Latin America and Africa."
   Geraldine Weiss, author of "Dividends Don't Lie" and
editor of Investment Quality Trends, emphasizes dividend
yields. Each stock has its own distinctive overvalued and
undervalued yield levels, she says. The DJIA is undervalued
when it yields 6% and overvalued when it yields 3%. Based on
the current dividend payments of the 30 Dow industrial
stocks, the index could rise to 3556 before it would be
clearly overvalued. It would be clearly undervalued at 1778.
"Historically, there is strong support at the 4% {dividend}
level," currently 2660, Ms. Weiss asserted.
   Banks, she said, are extremely undervalued: "The market is
virtually giving them away." Among her bank recommendations
are Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific. Other
stocks she recommends include IBM, Eastman Kodak, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, Syntex, Xerox, K mart and United Industrial.
   Richard Band, a contrarian with a considerable following,
writes the newsletter Richard Band's Profitable Investing. He
likes the British market because it has been hard hit, and
recommends British Telecom, United Kingdom Fund, British Gas,
British Petroleum and Shell Transport &amp; Trading, which owns
40% of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The rest is owned by
Royal Dutch Petroleum. Shell Oil Co. is the U.S. unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
   Mr. Band also sees a "great bargain-hunting opportunity"
in utilities, which dropped about 13% in the first quarter.
His favorites include Pacific Telesis and Global Utility
Fund.
   Wall Street Digest's Mr. Rowe, was perhaps the biggest
bull at the conference. He believes the Federal Reserve Board
will lick inflation, bringing down interest rates on
long-term Treasury bonds to 7% by the end of 1991. "They will
probably not yield 9% again in our lifetime," he declares. He
would avoid inflation hedges such as gold, and likes
high-tech companies such as Microsoft.
   InvesTech's Mr. Stack, a pundit widely respected by other
newsletter writers, was gloomier. He noted that auto sales
and housing remain weak, that inflation in almost every
industrialized country was higher at the end of 1989 than at
the end of 1988, and that the same was true of interest
rates. "We may indeed be dropping into a recession," he
concluded. He added: "Don't look to economists or politicians
to tell you if {we are}. Economists failed to forecast all
four of the past four recessions. Economic forecasting is the
science that made astrology respectable."
