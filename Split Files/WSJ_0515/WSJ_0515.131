   NEW YORK, N.Y. -- AmBase Corp. reported a first-quarter
loss of $42 million, or $1.24 a share, after realizing losses
on its junk-bond portfolio and beefing up reserves for its
thrift unit.
   The insurance and financial-services company also
suspended its quarterly five-cent common stock dividend. The
company is already facing hordes of dissatisfied
institutional investors who own about 40% of AmBase's shares
outstanding. They've seen the value of their holdings plummet
from a high of about 31 in 1986 to the current $6.375, up
12.5 cents, where the stock closed yesterday in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

   AmBase said it still plans to pay a special dividend to
shareholders when it completes the sale of its Home Insurance
Co. unit, which has been on the block since February.
   During the first quarter, AmBase realized $42 million in
investment losses at its insurance units. The company said
the losses reflect the deterioration in the high-yield bond
market and a decision to reduce the level on noninvestment
grade holdings in the portfolio. The company added that the
investment portfolios of these units are being repositioned
to reduce the credit risks associated with investments in
high-yield bonds.
   The company earned $26 million or 75 cents a share in the
1989 first quarter. Revenues in the latest quarter fell 8.3%
to $777 million.
   The company said it expects to sign a new bank credit
agreement this month. The new financing will be used to repay
all existing bank debt and provide working capital until the
sale of Home Insurance Co. The new facility will be fully
repaid when the sale is closed, AmBase said.
