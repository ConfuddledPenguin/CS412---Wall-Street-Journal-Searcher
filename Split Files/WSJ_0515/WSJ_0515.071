   Tokyo stock prices surged Monday in active buying
encouraged by the yen's recovery and lower interest rates in
the bond market. The benchmark Nikkei index finished above
the 32000-point level for the first time in two months.
   London shares posted their largest daily gain since last
July.

   The dollar finished Tokyo trading at 153.35 yen, up from
152.70 yen late Friday in New York but still well off its
levels in the middle of last week. The yen's strength,
meanwhile, helped push up bond prices, thus lowering their
yields.
   Strong buying interest stimulated by such rapid
improvement on currency and bond markets pushed up the Nikkei
index 420 points within 15 minutes of the opening. Supported
by growing expectations for future advances, the Nikkei index
remained at higher levels the rest of the day to close up
530.51 points at 32042.65, somewhat below its intraday high
of 32071.08. The index advanced 531.88 points Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 73.34 points to
close the morning session at 32115.99.
   Monday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 800
million shares, up from 626 million Friday.
   Advancing issues widely outpaced declining issues, 761 to
225, while 137 issues remained unchanged.
   The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all
issues listed in the First Section finished higher for the
ninth consecutive trading day. The index, which gained 36.12
points Friday, was up 41.35 points, or 1.76%, to close at
2390.32.
   The Second Section index, which advanced 63.67 points
Friday, added 25.64 points, or 0.67%, to close at 3845.46.
Volume in the Second Section was 17 million shares, down from
23 million Friday.
   A wide range of investors, including usually cautious
financial institutions, came back to the trading floor
Monday. Especially active were foreign investors and Japanese
corporations, traders said.
   Many participants said they had expected the Nikkei to
face strong selling pressure when it cleared 31600 points,
which marked a one-third recovery of the loss the index
posted from its high of 38915 on Dec. 29, and its low of
28002 April 2.
   But such selling pressure was overwhelmed by strong buying
interest Monday, they said.
   An official at a major financial institution said the
market is likely to absorb selling pressure this week, helped
by strong buying interest from investors who fear they will
miss profit-taking opportunities unless they have stock
holdings.
   Many institutional investors have kept their positions at
low levels and shifted their funds to the short-term money
market since early April as they expected another stock
plunge in April or May, said Hironobu Hagio, manager of the
equity division at Nippon Life Insurance Co.
   But now that currency and interest rates are moving in
opposite directions from expectations, these investors are
rushing back to the stock market, he said.
   A key to further advances of stock prices is when and how
much these investors would shift their funds from short-term
money markets back to stocks, he said.
   However, Mr. Hagio also cited investors such as his
company, which bought stocks in April when prices were lower,
that are awaiting selling opportunities amid recent sharp
gains.
   Electricals were one of a few losing sectors Monday, as
the yen's recovery discouraged investors' interest in these
export-oriented companies, traders said. Sony, Pioneer and
TDK ended lower.
   Advances, meanwhile, were led by steel manufacturers,
shipbuilders, electric power companies and trading houses.
   Tokyo Electric Power gained 260 yen ($1.70) to 4,670 yen.
Nippon Steel was up 18 to 629 and Marubeni Corp. rose 20 to
845.
   Securities companies also advanced on the recent recovery
of stocks, traders said. Nomura Securities rose 130 to 2,430,
while Daiwa Securities ended at 1,640, up 80.
   London shares finished at the day's highs albeit in
sluggish trading, ending well above the psychologically
important 2200-level barrier on the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index.
   The index closed up 38.6 points at 2214.5 and well above
its intraday minimum of 2202.0, reached just after the start
of official dealings.
   At the close, the narrower FT 30 share index was up 24.7
points at 1733.5. Volume was a relatively thin 375.1 million
shares, compared with the moderate 510.1 million that changed
hands Friday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2252.0, up broadly from 2215.0 Friday.
   Strength on Wall Street added fuel to an early rally that
was sustained throughout the session and exaggerated by a
shortage of stock, dealers said.
   The market largely ignored some gloomy economic news
released around midday that showed increases in the U.K.'s
April retail sales and producer price indexes, indicating
continued high inflation.
   The government reported a 1% rise in April retail sales
from March -- surpassing market expectations of a 0.3%
monthly rise -- and a 2.4% yearly increase. April's
provisional producer price index showed output prices rising
1% from March.
   Despite the sharp advance, most London dealers were
skeptical about the market's being able to sustain its
bullish momentum against the grim economic backdrop in the
U.K.
   There have been no positive fundamental changes in
Britain's economy that will lend confidence to institutional
investors and spur fresh buying, traders said. To reassure
players that the stock market is the investment vehicle of
choice, a solid indication that inflation is falling or
interest rates will be eased would be necessary, and neither
looks likely in the short term, they said.
   Clothing and food retailer Marks &amp; Spencer added 4 1/2
pence (7.5 cents) to 202 1/2 pence after reporting a 14% rise
in pretax profit, coming in at the high end of market
expectations.
   Gas utility British Gas, which announced a management
restructuring, rose 6 1/2 to 210. Conglomerate Polly Peck,
which went ex-dividend, jumped 14 to 419 as it agreed to sell
nine refrigerated cargo ships acquired in the takeover of Del
Monte to a Norwegian consortium for $237.8 million.
   Enterprise and Lasmo, the oil companies, firmed after
Kuwait officially announced it will cut back on operating
spot contracts, leaving more room for the British concerns.
Enterprise rose 18 to 618 and Lasmo climbed 17 to 400.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Brussels, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Milan and lower in Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich.
South African golds closed firmer.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Hong
Kong and Singapore, lower in Taipei and Seoul and little
changed in Manila.
