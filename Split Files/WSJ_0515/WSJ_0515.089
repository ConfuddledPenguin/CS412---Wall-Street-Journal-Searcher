   WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Securities
Dealers said it canceled the membership of Wellshire
Securities Inc., a penny-stock firm based in New York.
   The cancellation followed a preliminary injunction granted
by a federal court in Manhattan in April at the request of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In March, the SEC
filed a civil suit alleging that Wellshire and its executives
made false and misleading statements about the stocks they
were promoting.

   The SEC complaint said that from June 1988 to the present,
Wellshire, under the direction of Robert Cohen and Carol
Martino, has operated a penny-stock "boiler room," selling
speculative over-the-counter securities to the public through
the use of abusive sales practices and inflated price
predictions.
   "Wellshire and Cohen and Martino haven't been given the
benefit of a full trial," said Mitchell Lampert, an attorney
for the executives. "But the damage has already been done."
Wellshire and the two executives previously have denied any
wrongdoing.
