   We're not much for sounding alarms about Japan buying
America, but the latest incident simply can't be ignored. A
recent issue of Michigan Law School's alumni publication
hails alumnus and noted Japan critic Rep. Richard Gephardt
(J.D. '65) for his election as House Majority Leader. The
same issue reports that Nippon Life Insurance Company has
given the school $1.2 million to endow a professorship in
Japanese law. None dare call it conspiracy.
