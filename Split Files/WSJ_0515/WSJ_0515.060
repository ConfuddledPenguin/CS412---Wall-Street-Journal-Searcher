   Cray Research Inc., seeking to protect its dominance in
the supercomputer market, is introducing a new generation of
relatively inexpensive, entry-level machines.
   The machines will start at $2.2 million, a price that puts
them in competition with entry-level technology from Japanese
rival Fujitsu Ltd. as well as intensive-computing devices
from such domestic competitors as International Business
Machines Corp., based in Armonk, N.Y., and Convex Computer
Corp., based in Richardson, Texas.

   Called the Y-MP2E, the latest Cray supercomputers are a
downward extension of the company's primary line of Y-MPs
(for multiprocessor). Until now, the cheapest Y cost $5
million while the eight-processor version -- the world's
largest -- cost nearly $23 million.
   The new machines contain the same processing and memory
technology, and run at the same six nanosecond (billionths of
a second) cycle speed, as other members of the Y family. But
the small versions won't need the cumbersome cooling
"plumbing" its larger siblings require. Instead, they can be
either air-cooled or water-cooled, allowing them to fit into
current computer-room environments.
   Four years ago, Minneapolis-based Cray rolled out a $2.5
million machine called the X-MP/14se, which the company then
described as a "starter set." Now discontinued, it was
intended to offer supercomputing to potential users who
either couldn't afford or didn't need full-sized machines.
But the one-processor 14se was limited in its capabilities,
and couldn't connect to large data-storage devices.
   Those limitations as well as the development of a new
generation of technology led to that machine's demise.
   The 2E also replaces earlier one-processor and
two-processor Y machines, which didn't offer air cooling and
which cost twice as much. Moreover, the new machines offer
larger memories than the previous models.
   Cray said it is positioning the new small machines for two
types of customers -- those looking for an entry into
supercomputing and those current users with computing
problems too small for their current supercomputers but too
complex for easy solution elsewhere. Thus, the latter will be
able to "download" those discrete problems to the small Y.
   Supercomputers typically are used to tackle problems too
complex for regular mainframe machines; often the problems
are sophisticated mathematical models used to design such
products as automobiles, airplanes and drugs, or simulations
of such events as a nuclear explosion.
   Although the company says it made two-thirds of the
world's current supercomputer systems, it has been facing
increasing competition at the low end of the market,
particularly as it fights for more commercial customers. The
new line extension seeks to "offer customers real
supercomputer power at affordable prices," said Marcelo
Gumucio, Cray's president.
   Acknowledging what he called supercomputing's changing
landscape, Cray's chairman and chief executive officer, John
A. Rollwagen, said the company was responding to the
increasing popularity of computer networks while continuing
"aggressive development at the high end of the performance
spectrum."
   Mr. Gumucio said shipments of the 2E would begin within
three or four months but declined to estimate how many the
company was projecting to sell or lease in the next year.
   Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. analyst Barry Willman estimates
that the new machine will contribute only marginally to
revenue this year but forecasts about 15 systems being
shipped next year. Gary Smaby, a Minneapolis-based analyst
who heads his own company, said he expects margins on the new
products to be "modestly lower" than on larger Cray machines.
   Cray stock closed at $48.75, up 75 cents, in composite
trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
