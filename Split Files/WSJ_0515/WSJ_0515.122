   BONN -- Reeling from his party's losses in two key state
elections, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is now hinting
that combined German national elections could come as early
as December.
   By pushing up the potential date for a combined vote from
sometime late next year, Mr. Kohl obliquely raised the
possibility that the next election involving him would be for
chancellor of a united Germany rather than of West Germany
alone. Given the poor showing of his Christian Democrats
party during the weekend, it appears a unified German
election would give him a better chance to win.

   This weekend's voting signals the depth of his problems.
In North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, two states that
together account for more than 40% of the nation's registered
voters, Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats suffered embarrassing
defeats and lost control of the upper house of the West
German parliament, made up of representatives from the
states. The elections were touted as litmus tests of Bonn's
policy on German unity.
   Mr. Kohl is thought to privately favor a combined election
in December, which would effectively merge the two nations
into a single political entity. But he has never openly
endorsed such a plan, and he has no power to dictate such a
proposal.
   In a news conference, Mr. Kohl said he didn't "rule out"
an election taking place in East Germany on the same day as
the West German Bundestag election, set for Dec. 2. But he
didn't elaborate.
   West German sources say that the weekend election has left
Mr. Kohl on the political defensive and in need of a strategy
shift. "The elections in those two states have added to the
pressure to just hold a combined German election and get it
over with," says one government official.
   The West German leader would almost certainly stand a
better chance in a combined German vote. In East Germany's
first free elections, which took place in March, the
Christian Democrats, the sister party to Mr. Kohl's party in
the West, scored a dazzling victory over the Social
Democrats.
   Mr. Kohl is also under pressure from his political allies
in Bonn to push for an early combined election. The leader of
the Free Democrats, Otto Lambsdorff, repeated his party's
call for a merged German election on Dec. 2 or Jan. 13. The
Free Democrats are the junior partner in Bonn's
right-of-center coalition. Mr. Lambsdorff, who heaped all
blame for the weekend's election results on Mr. Kohl's
Christian Democrats, said the longer the country waited for
unification, the more difficult it would become.
   Against this background, Germans on both sides of the
border appear to be having second thoughts about the rush
toward early unity. East Germans are worried about the impact
of massive unemployment and other uncertainties as they
plunge into a free-market system, while the West Germans are
beginning to grumble about the potential costs to their own
highly prosperous society.
   These anxieties have created a ripe target for the
opposition Social Democrats, who have campaigned on the idea
that Bonn is moving too fast.
