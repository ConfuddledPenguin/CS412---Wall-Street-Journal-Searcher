   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- Stock markets in Europe and
the U.S. reacted favorably to a management shake-up at N.V.
Philips, the big Dutch electronics company. But analysts and
management experts say the company still faces tough times.
   Wisse Dekker, chairman of Philips's supervisory board,
confirmed that President Cornelis van der Klugt will step
down on July 1. Mr. Dekker said the board would recommend
that Jan Timmer, currently in charge of the company's
consumer electronics division, be approved by shareholders as
the new president. He said Philips would call a special
meeting of shareholders sometime "just before July 1" to
approve the management changes.

   Gert Lorenz, head of the company's struggling computer
division and a member of the board of management, will also
step down effective July 1. The computer business was mainly
responsible for a steep and unexpected decline in the
company's first-quarter profits, which caused a big sell-off
of Philips shares earlier this month. No successor to Mr.
Lorenz has been named.
   Philips shares recaptured some lost ground on the news of
the management changes, closing yesterday at 33.40 guilders
($18.15) on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, up two guilders. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Philips rose 25
cents a share to $18.125.
   But the stock remains well below the level on May 2, the
day before Philips's announced first-quarter results, when
the stock closed at 37.70 guilders. The next morning, the
company shocked financial markets with a report that its
first-quarter operating profit amounted to only six million
guilders ($3.3 million), down from 223 million guilders a
year earlier. Those results came only a few weeks after Mr.
van der Klugt had confidently predicted that 1990 would be a
better year than 1989. (The company now says that an
improvement over last year's results is unlikely.)
   Mr. Dekker, himself a former Philips president who stepped
in to manage crisis meetings at company headquarters over the
weekend, appeared alone at yesterday's press conference. He
read a curt statement that said the big Dutch electronic
company was determined to overcome the "crisis of confidence"
that resulted from the first-quarter profit fiasco.
   He also said he had asked Mr. van der Klugt to explain why
the company had so badly overestimated its prospects, but
that Mr. van der Klugt "has no proper explanation."
   Mr. Dekker said Mr. Timmer would be given free reign to
try to fix Philips's profitability problems.
   Analysts reacted favorably to Mr. Timmer's appointment.
Most said that his reputation for toughness and bottom-line
management are exactly what the company needs. "I think
investors will be quite encouraged," said Eleanor Buss, an
analyst at Robert Fleming Securities in London.
   But analysts added that Philips now faces a wrenching set
of choices and a full-fledged rethinking of its game plan --
though time for this will be short. "Philips will really have
to ask itself a lot of fundamental questions," said Chris
Honnor, an analyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities in London.
"The basic one is whether the company really is manageable"
in its current sprawling size.
   He and others said the company's inability to predict its
performance accurately shows that it is too far-flung and has
too much bureaucracy between the marketplace and its
management. "Information has to go through too many layers
before it reaches the top decision-makers" said Willem
Burgers, an analyst at Van Meer-James Capel in Amsterdam.
