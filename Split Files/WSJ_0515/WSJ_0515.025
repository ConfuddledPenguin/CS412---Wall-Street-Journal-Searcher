   Black &amp; Decker Corp. is expected to name Michael N.
Hammes, Chrysler Corp.'s vice president of international
operations, to head its largest unit, the $2 billion
power-tools division.
   Joseph E. Cappy, Chrysler vice president of brand
development, will succeed Mr. Hammes, according to Chrysler
officials who asked not to be identified. This could lead to
dismantling a new marketing organization Chrysler set up just
six months ago.

   A Chrysler spokesman refused to confirm the moves. "It's
all rumor and speculation and as you know we don't comment on
these things," he said."
   A Black &amp; Decker spokeswoman said she couldn't comment on
"who had been selected" to head the power tool unit, "or when
any announcement would be made." But, she added, it has been
no secret that Black &amp; Decker has been searching for a
"global manager type" for its core power-tools business since
February. That's when George M. Sherman, who turned the
division around with innovative cordless and professional
products backed by savvy marketing campaigns, became
president of Danaher Corp., the Washington, D.C., industrial
products company controlled by Steven and Mitchell Rales.
   The Chrysler officials say Black &amp; Decker has actively
courted Mr. Hammes, a Chicago native with an undergraduate
degree from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service
and almost 30 years experience with Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler, which he joined in 1986.
   The 48-year-old Mr. Hammes's last jobs at Ford were vice
president of truck operations for Ford of Europe and
president/managing director of Ford's Mexican subsidiary.
   During his four years with Chrysler, however, Mr. Hammes's
work has consisted mainly of overseeing increased sales and
joint venture activities. Chrysler hasn't any assembly plants
outside North America but is establishing several overseas
production ventures including one with Renault S.A. for Jeep
vehicles in Europe and another with Steyr-Daimler-Puch of
Austria for minivans.
   At Black &amp; Decker, based in Towson, Md., Mr. Hammes is
expected to pick up Mr. Sherman's title of executive vice
president and president of the Power Tools and Home
Improvement Group. This is considered the company's
second-highest post behind Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Nolan Archibald.
   Replacing Mr. Sherman will free Mr. Archibald to focus on
divesting some operations following last year's acquisition
of Emhart Corp., a move designed to broaden Black &amp; Decker's
product lines and expand overseas. But the roughly $2 billion
acquisition saddled the company with high debt and several
unrelated businesses that have been put up for sale -- an
effort that, so far, has been slow and frustrating.
   Mr. Cappy, who is expected to succeed Mr. Hammes, was
named Chrysler's vice president for brand development only
last November. At that time, the Highland Park, Mich., auto
maker streamlined its marketing operations, eliminating one
vice presidency and several middle management positions.
   Mr. Cappy's role in the new structure was to assure that
Chrysler created distinct products for each of its six
brands, a role that seemed to duplicate responsibilities in
other operations. John B. Damoose was given responsibility
for developing distinctive marketing strategies and the title
of vice president, brand marketing.
   It couldn't immediately be determined whether Chrysler
will replace Mr. Cappy, who joined Chrysler in 1987 when the
No. 3 auto maker acquired American Motors Corp. Some Chrysler
executives are said to favor even more streamlining to cut
costs and improve efficiency. This could mean development
activities currently reporting to Mr. Cappy could be merged
with existing design, sales, marketing and engineering
operations.
