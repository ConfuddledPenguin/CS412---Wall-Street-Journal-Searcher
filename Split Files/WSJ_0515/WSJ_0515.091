   J.C. Penney Co., Dallas, said it will purchase from NCR
Corp., Dayton, Ohio, more than $45 million in point-of-sale
workstation systems this year as part of a three-year project
to upgrade terminals in about 1,400 stores nationwide.
   Penney began the project last year.

   The companies said the new system, among other things,
allows Penney to replace the traditional charge slip with a
single sales slip printed by the computer and signed by the
customer.
