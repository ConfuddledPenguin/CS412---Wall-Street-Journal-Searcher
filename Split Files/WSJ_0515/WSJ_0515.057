   The alarming signs appear in U.S. hospitals hundreds of
thousands of times every year. Patients show symptoms,
perhaps a fever and a drop in blood pressure, that signal a
gram-negative infection. If their condition worsens, the next
stages can follow in days: septic shock, organ failure and
death.
   After decades of refining the standard treatments for such
infections, doctors had begun to despair of cutting the death
toll much more. But now there is talk of a breakthrough,
possibly the next big products out of biotechnology.

   Two competitors, Centocor Inc. and Xoma Corp., are seeking
clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for an
entirely new sort of anti-infection drug, whetting keen
interest in medical and financial circles alike.
   "This could be a huge product" category, says David
Webber, a biotechnology analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.,
Xoma's lead investment banker. "This has the potential to
save more lives than TPA," the flagship product of biotech
leader Genentech Inc.
   To be sure, only selected results from trials of the drugs
have been made public to date. Doctors and analysts want to
see more, starting with published reports in peer-reviewed
medical journals. Even if the drugs fulfill their promise,
questions will remain about how soon after the onset of
infection the drugs should be given.
   "Data from both Centocor and Xoma are very exciting. I
just think we don't want to go overboard" in raising
expectations for the drugs, says Harvey Rubin, an
infectious-disease specialist at the University of
Pennsylvania who worked on the trial of Centocor's drug.
   The latest disclosure came at a medical conference where
Elizabeth Ziegler, a researcher at the University of
California at San Diego, reported on some of her group's
findings with Centocor's drug, Centoxin. One striking result:
Over the first 28 days of the trial, the drug cut the death
rate by 51% for severely ill patients suffering from septic
shock, which is characterized by a sharp fall in blood
pressure, and failure of the lungs, kidneys or liver.
   "You could possibly fill Yankee Stadium with the people
whose lives will be saved each year," says Centocor's
president, James Wavle. It might even be an overflow crowd at
the stadium, which has a capacity of 55,000.
   By some estimates, there are about 200,000 cases a year in
the U.S. of gram-negative sepsis, the stage of the disease
when the infection begins to cause disturbing symptoms and
doctors might start using the new drugs. Some 80,000 of those
cases are estimated to be fatal. The toll in Europe, where
Centocor and Xoma have marketing plans as well, is thought to
be about as heavy. Since the death rate of patients who got
Centoxin fell 43% by the end of hospitalization, roughly
69,000 lives could be saved a year in the U.S. and Europe.
   The infection-causing bacteria, called gram-negative
because they don't hold the dye in a laboratory staining
technique, grow benignly in the intestine. But they can
become deadly if they enter the bloodstream or other tissue
through burns, abdominal wounds, surgery or contaminated
catheters.
   The new drugs, unlike antibiotics that act upon the
bacteria, latch on to toxins made by the bacteria, thus
blocking the next biochemical step in the disease process.
Both drugs are monoclonal antibodies, proteins that zero in
on selected targets in the body. Centoxin is derived from
human spleen cells; Xoma's drug, called Xomen E-5, from mouse
spleen cells.
   For Centocor, based in Malvern, Pa., and Xoma, based in
Berkeley, Calif., the drugs could be company-making products.
Neither sells a therapeutic product of any kind today. Each
could vault into the top ranks of the biotech industry on the
strength of its anti-infection drug alone. Some estimates
from Wall Street put the combined U.S. and European sales for
both drugs at $750 million by the mid-1990s.
   One reason for the jumbo market projections is sky-high
prices for drugs produced by biotechnology. Centoxin and
Xomen-E5 both are expected to cost between $1,500 and $2,500
for a single course of treatment, given by injection.
   Another reason is the likelihood that the drug will be
overprescribed, since symptoms of gram-negative sepsis can
mimic those of other types of infections. The lab tests
needed to confirm the initial diagnosis can take a couple of
days, and a patient's condition may deteriorate in the
meantime. As a result, doctors would tend to use the drugs
early and worry about perfecting the diagnosis later -- at
least until faster tests became available.
   A suggestion of how often the drugs may be used on
patients for whom they aren't designed can be gleaned from
the Centoxin trial. Of 543 patients given the drug because
they appeared to have symptoms of gram-negative sepsis, only
317 were proven by the lab work to have had gram-negative
infections.
   "Even economically, it seems to make sense" to use the
drugs early, says Roger Bone, a researcher on intensive-care
costs at Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago. Dr. Bone says that by keeping patients from becoming
deathly ill, the drugs would prevent stays in intensive-care
units that run up costs of several hundred thousand dollars.
   With such a large market at stake, the two companies are
already taking swipes at each other. Centocor is hoping to
build an early case that it has the more powerful drug, since
Xomen E-5 in its first trial didn't show effectiveness in
cases of septic shock with organ failure. Xoma President
Patrick Scannon, asserting that Centocor is "data-dredging,"
replies by noting the companies' trials differed in the sort
of patients evaluated in shock cases.
   Xoma, which has reported that its drug was effective in
patients who weren't in shock, raises questions about the
potency of Centoxin in that group, for which Centocor hasn't
yet broken out numbers. To this, Centocor's research chief,
Harvey Berger, retorts, "They're just trying to find holes in
data that's rock solid."
   The battle of words between Centocor and Xoma is a preview
of the fight ahead if their drugs get marketing clearance
from the FDA. Centocor vows to market Centoxin by itself, in
contrast to its practice of licensing its diagnostic products
to giant health-care concerns. The gain for the company will
be enormous if the drug wins acceptance, because all the
profit will be Centocor's.
   The risk for Centocor is enormous, too. The company
expects initially to have no more than 75 salespeople in the
U.S. Xoma has licensed Xomen E-5 to Pfizer Inc., and so will
have a force of 750 behind its product. Xoma also beat
Centocor by six months in applying to the FDA.
   Already the contest has entered the courtroom, with Xoma
filing a patent-infringement suit against Centocor in federal
court in San Francisco last month. Other companies are
looking to join the fray, too.
   Cetus Corp. has an antibody against gram-negative toxins
in early clinical trials, and Bayer AG has licensed from
Chiron Corp. an antibody aimed not at the toxins but at
harmful substances produced by the body in response to them.
