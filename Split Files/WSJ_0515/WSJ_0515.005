   SELMER, Tenn. -- Rep. Don Sundquist usually comes here to
rural western Tennessee to dispense advice and assistance.
But this day he's here to get some, too.
   At the aging McNairy County Courthouse, the popular
Republican tells his audience that a tax increase may soon be
looming in Washington and, with evident unease, inquires,
"Should I vote for it?" The answer is surprising. Even in
these conservative, cotton-growing flatlands east of Memphis,
it isn't an automatic "no."

   Donald Porter, a retired naval officer, speaks up to
recommend a 3% sales tax on luxury items. Paul Simpson, a
local attorney, suggests a nickel-a-can tax on beer (even
though County Sheriff Robert Lee teases him about how much
that tax would cost him). And Rep. Sundquist mentions --
though he doesn't endorse -- an increase in the levy on
gasoline.
   "Generally, they don't think it's a question of whether
they're going to have a tax," Mr. Sundquist says later as he
rides to his next town-hall meeting. "It's which one." Here
in the temperate countryside, Mr. Sundquist believes, the
taxes of choice would fall hardest on whiskey, cigarettes and
beer.
   If Mr. Sundquist's experience is any example, the tax
issue mightn't be as lethal as some Republicans fear. While
few people volunteer to pay more taxes, many profess concern
that the federal budget deficit has gotten out of hand and
needs to be reduced significantly. That leads to a sense of
inevitability about an eventual tax rise. Moreover, grousing
about inadequate federal aid, especially in health care and
transportation, is far louder than the complaints about high
taxes.
   Of course, the four-term legislator does catch some flak
on the prospect of tax increases. Further up the two-lane
highway at Henderson, Arthur Kuster, a retired civil
engineer, puts the point bluntly. "I don't think we need a
tax increase," he says, and adds about President Bush: "I
hope he don't break his word."
   Some Republican strategists agree with that philosophy,
and worry that compromise will hurt them at the polls. Just
last Thursday, a group of Republican hardliners marched
before the television cameras on Capitol Hill to repeat their
"no-new-tax" pledge, and to urge President Bush to do the
same. Among them were two lawmakers who are especially
displeased with the president, Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois
and Bill Schuette of Michigan, whose campaigns for the Senate
are based partly on unswerving opposition to tax increases.
   As a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee,
Rep. Sundquist will be in the trenches of any tax-increase
battle. And from that vantage point, he manages to see two
sides to the argument. On the one hand, taxes have been a
defining -- and winning -- issue for the Republicans over the
years. But after controlling the White House for so long, the
party also bears responsibility for governing, and trying to
solve national problems.
   "The Democrat Party has been correctly postured as the
party of tax increases, and that's been a clear difference
between us," Mr. Sundquist says. "On the other hand, there is
a political risk for those who say they won't go into a
budget summit at all."
   Each stop on this rainy weekend is punctuated with this
kind of "on the other hand" reflection. Here in Selmer, Mr.
Sundquist begins his remarks with a reminder about how
strongly he opposes tax increases, but then quickly moves to
the news: President Bush has agreed to begin
deficit-reduction talks with Congress, and taxes are on the
table. "I trust this president," he concludes. "I don't like
taxes, but if we come up with a compromise, I'll look at it."
   Some of Mr. Sundquist's constituents blanch at this
newfound flexibility, but few are put off completely. Billy
Burney, an owner of an auto-body shop and a carpet store in
Selmer, at first asserts that "the people in this district
are taxed enough." But under gentle questioning by the
congressman, Mr. Burney softens his position. He would resist
higher gasoline taxes and income-tax rates, he says, but he
also would "look at the whole picture" before saying "no
way."
   Closer to Memphis, on the steps of the Fayette County
Courthouse in Somerville, William Cowan Sr., a cotton farmer
from nearby La Grange, furrows his brow beneath his well-worn
cap when Mr. Sundquist discusses the budget talks. But when
he's asked about his own view, he answers with a shrug of his
shoulders. "They've got to get money from somewhere," he
says. "It looks like taxes are going to go up."
   Mr. Sundquist isn't willing to concede the point yet. But
that reluctance is as much a matter of strategy as of
principle. "The bottom line is that they will trust me to do
the very least in taxes, and that I'd get something in
exchange," the congressman says.
   The exchange Mr. Sundquist seeks mirrors the negotiating
position of President Bush. He says he would vote for a tax
increase only if the package includes long-term changes in
the budget process that would make it harder for Congress to
increase spending. Two methods he mentions would give the
president greater authority to delay funding for individual
programs and authority to put the federal government on a
two-year budget cycle.
   It would be hard for Mr. Sundquist to envision a tax plan
that he could embrace under any circumstance. His rural
constituents would scream about an increase in the gasoline
tax because of the long distances they drive. And even though
few of his constituents would be hurt by the change, he
spurns the idea of raising the individual tax rate on the
highest-income taxpayers -- a plan so vigorously favored by
Democrats that it may well be the linchpin to reaching an
accord.
   But as one of President Bush's biggest boosters in
Congress, Mr. Sundquist says he doesn't want to do anything
that would foreclose the president's options. He also
believes that Mr. Bush is so well-liked by the voters that
almost anything he endorses will fly.
   "A majority of our folks are in the same position I'm in,
and it's not comfortable," Mr. Sundquist says. On the other
hand, he adds, "In politics there's also a test of
reasonableness, and a fine line between being tough and
hard-headed."
