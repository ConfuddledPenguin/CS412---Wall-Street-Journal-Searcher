   Patrons Are Defecting
   To Foreign Carriers

   IF U.S. AIRLINES don't watch out, they may end up with the
same problem U.S. auto makers have: the reputation that
foreign is better.
   Increasingly, consumers are rating foreign airlines ahead
of U.S. airlines in service. A reader poll last fall by
Business Traveler International magazine is typical. Only
three U.S. airlines cracked the readers' list of top 10
international airlines. The most popular U.S. carrier on the
list, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, ranked only fifth
overall, behind Singapore Airlines, Swissair, British Airways
and Lufthansa.
   The trend is showing up in market-share figures, too. In
1989, only 40.9% of all trips between the U.S. and Europe
were on U.S.-owned carriers, down from 42.7% in 1988,
according to Airline Economics Inc.
   In reputation, "U.S. airlines have undoubtedly fallen
behind," says Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports Travel
Letter. "They've frittered away their leadership position and
are just fighting to stay even now."
   The biggest difference in service, consumer groups say, is
crew attitude. "Foreign airlines just seem to be attentive to
people's needs," says Richard Livingston, spokesman for the
International Airline Passenger Association. Consumers also
complain that domestic airlines are often just plain
cheapskates, charging for movies and drinks, while many
foreign carriers don't. "Little things like that really annoy
people," Mr. Perkins says.
   For their part, U.S. airlines insist that foreign service
often isn't really better, just different. "It seems better
because it's not what they normally get," says a spokesman
for the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group
based in Washington. Airlines also say some travelers still
avoid U.S. carriers because they think terrorists target
them.
                                                                                                       

   It Would Be Big of You
   To Take Another Seat
                                                                                                       

   TRAVELERS are starting to lose their patience with chubby
seat companions.
   At least one consumer newsletter, Ashington-Pickett
Airlines &amp; Travel Reports, says it is getting more complaints
about overweight passengers squishing their seatmates. One
Delta Air Lines passenger wrote he even had to spend most of
a recent trip to Orlando, Fla., on the flight attendant's
jump seat because the obese passenger assigned to sit next to
him made his own seat unbearable.
   "People really get upset about this and they're not the
least bit shy about complaining," says Michael
Ashington-Pickett, publisher of the newsletter, which is
based in Orlando.
   Consumer groups blame the planes. They insist airlines
have been cutting seat size on some wide-bodied jets to pack
in more seats, although seat manufacturers deny it. Seat
manufacturers do concede that leg room in coach has been cut
to 31 or 32 inches from about 34 inches.
   Technically, airlines can bar obese travelers if they
can't fit in the seat or if they block aisles, but airline
officials concede they almost never do that.
                                                                                                       

   In Hotels, Newer Means
   Fuller -- and Costlier
                                                                                                       

   WOULD YOU PAY an extra $10 a night to stay at a hotel just
because it was newer than another one?
   Apparently so. The average occupancy rate of hotels less
than three years old is two percentage points higher than at
older properties, according to a survey of more than 1,000
new hotels by Smith Travel Research. The average nightly
price for the newer properties is $69, compared with $59 for
older establishments.
   The trend is even more pronounced in the budget sector.
The younger accommodations, which on average cost $4 more
than the older hotels, have an average occupancy rate of
61.9%, compared with 57.4%.
   Given that even one percentage point can be the difference
between profit and loss, the newer properties obviously "have
a tremendous advantage," says Randy Smith, president of Smith
Travel, Hendersonville, Tenn.
   The appeal has as much to do with the design of new
properties as it does with age. New hotels usually have
interior hallways, which many travelers prefer to the outdoor
ones, Mr. Smith says. The newer hotels also tend to have
smaller dining rooms and lobbies, which guests say they
prefer because they hold down overall costs.
   New hotels also tend to be marketed better, he says,
because the pressure to earn profits is higher. Years ago,
there were so many tax advantages to building hotels that a
lot of owners didn't need to make much money from the
operations. But with the tax laws changed and the industry in
a slow period, hotels have become much more aggressive -- and
new hotels tout their advantages.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   AFTER YEARS of spending freely on their tourism
departments, many states are sharply cutting back.
Massachusetts has budgeted $6.9 million for its tourism
department this year, down from $9.5 million in 1989. New
York plans to cut its tourism budget about 15%. The cutbacks
reflect the downturn in the state economies. There are, of
course, exceptions. California and Hawaii are among those
that have increased their tourism budgets, according to the
U.S. Travel Data Center. . . . Avis Inc. received the highest
performance rating among rental car companies in a survey of
400 executives by Opinion Research Corp. But its approval
results aren't that much to brag about. Only 60% of the
executives gave it a rating of 8 or better on a 1 to 10
scale. Hertz Corp. came in second with 57%, followed by
National Car Rental Systems Inc. (51%), and Budget Rent a Car
Inc. (40%).
