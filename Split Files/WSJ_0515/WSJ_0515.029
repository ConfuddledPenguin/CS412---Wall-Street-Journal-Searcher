   Bullish investors stampeded the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to a record high, but by yesterday afternoon the
rally that began last Friday was quickly losing energy.
   The industrial average rose 19.95 to close at 2821.53 in
heavy trading, eclipsing the Jan. 2 high of 2810.15. But the
gain represented a sharp decline from the intraday advance of
50.44 at about 1 p.m. EDT.

   Bond prices posted solid gains, pushing long-term interest
rates lower, but their advance also weakened in late trading.
The dollar continued to lose ground against most currencies,
albeit at a slower pace than in Friday's sharp retreat.
   The stock market's performance Friday and Monday raised
questions about the extent to which prices can keep rising.
"When it happens so suddenly, I've got to be suspicious about
it," said Laszlo Birinyi, a stock market strategist.
"Suddenly Friday everybody saw the light. It was a sudden
right turn and I don't think those are the situations that
lead to continued long, long gains."
   Mr. Birinyi and others were also concerned that the
biggest price gains yesterday continued to come in a small
group of big, well-known stocks. The broader market, which
has lagged the industrial average badly in recent months,
remains far short of old records. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index, for instance, closed at 354.75, nearly 1.5% below its
Oct. 9, 1989, record high of 359.80.
   The rally was triggered Friday by plunging interest rates
as bond investors bid up prices of Treasury issues. The bond
market was responding not only to evidence that inflation is
waning and economic growth is moderate, but also to the
positive mood created by the apparent willingness of the Bush
administration and Congress to work together to trim the
nation's huge budget deficit.
   The perception that interest rates had peaked a week
earlier when the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yielded more
than 9% inspired money managers to shift money into the stock
market from their bulging hoards of cash. The euphoric buying
drove the industrial average up 63.07 points Friday.
   Yesterday morning saw money managers continuing their
buying spree, with big blue-chip technology, energy and
chemical stocks their primary targets. Their buying was
punctuated by several waves of stock-index arbitrage buy
programs that pushed the industrial average up more than 50
points at 1 p.m. EDT.
   But the buying enthusiasm was tempered when news services
carried comments from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
that he expects deficit-cutting negotiations between
President Bush and Congress to "last weeks, if not months."
   "As soon as that headline came up on the newswires, the
market went from about plus 51 to plus 30," said Arthur
Cashin Jr., director of floor operations for PaineWebber Inc.
"The bulk of the rationale for the rally has been a change in
interest rates," Mr. Cashin said, but the budget news set
back expectations that interest rates could continue to slide
much lower. Mr. Birinyi, the stock market strategist, said he
still expects the stock market to do better than it has in
the past few months, with the Dow Jones industrials
approaching the 3000 mark in coming weeks. "But I'd be
surprised if we go above that level and then you're going to
go back to more of the same thing we've had all year --
dramatic trading and a lot of volatility within a price
range."
   Skeptical money managers suggested that the rapid price
action is more a symptom of the volatility in the market than
of any underlying change in the economy or the outlook for
such fundamental measures of stock values as corporate
profits.
   "I continue to be amazed at the rapidity with which
emotions change over the course of a few hours or a few
days," said Ellen Harris, manager of the PaineWebber Classic
Growth Fund. "Concerns that were expressed 11 days ago have
now been forgotten. Economists who would have thrown in the
towel are now focusing on the numbers that are going their
way."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed sharply in heavy trading. Volume
totaled 225.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange,
where advancing issues swamped losers 1,062 to 555.
   Bond prices rose. The Treasury's new benchmark 30-year
bond gained 5/8 point, or about $6.25 for each $1,000 of face
amount. The yield on the issue slipped to 8.58%.
   The dollar fell modestly. In late New York trading the
U.S. currency was quoted at 1.6425 marks and 152.47 yen,
compared with 1.6478 marks and 152.65 yen Friday.
