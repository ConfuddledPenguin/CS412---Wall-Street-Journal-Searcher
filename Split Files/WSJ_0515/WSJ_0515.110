   The company also said Kevin E. Gage would succeed James E.
Banks as president and chief executive officer of Hometown
Bancorp. because, company Chairman Douglas D. Milne III said,
"a more aggressive approach to management was required to
steer the company through these troubled times."
   Mr. Banks will become vice chairman of the company.
   The loss was $2.1 million, or $1.13 a share, vs.
year-earlier profit of $147,000, or eight cents a share. The
company cited $2.1 million set aside for possible loan losses
and other reserves, reflecting a troubled real estate market.
