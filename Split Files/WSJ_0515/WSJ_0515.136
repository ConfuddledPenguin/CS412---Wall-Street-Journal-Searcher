   SKOKIE, Ill. -- G.D. Searle &amp; Co. said it will introduce a
blood pressure medicine in the U.S. by giving it away for six
months.
   Under what the drug company calls its Patient Plus
program, Searle will provide doctors with vouchers to be
given to patients with their prescriptions for the drug
Kerlone. The vouchers can be redeemed at pharmacies as
prescriptions for the drug are filled.

   Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co., a St. Louis-based
diversified chemicals company, is introducing Kerlone into a
crowded market of drugs called beta blockers. Two of the
biggest competitors will be Tenormin, sold by Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC; and Lopressor, sold by Ciba-Geigy
Ltd.
   The Searle vouchers cover both the pharmacist's dispensing
fee and the wholesale cost of the drug -- which for six
months would run from about $100 to $150, depending on the
dosage prescribed. Patients can be enrolled in the program
from May 15 until Aug. 31. A spokeswoman for Searle said the
company hasn't estimated the total value of the drug to be
given away.
   Searle said it hopes Kerlone will win favor with doctors
because of its sustained action in the body.
