   MOSCOW -- Lee Sang Mo has been in the Soviet capital for
three months and still doesn't have an office. The head of
the Moscow liaison branch of South Korea's Lucky-Goldstar
Group sits in a cramped hotel room, eating instant noodles
out of a throwaway plastic bowl. He can't speak Russian or
find a private lawyer to represent the group. It takes a day
or two to get a call through to his Seoul headquarters.
   "I think I need a year or 18 months longer just to get
these difficulties under control," he says.

   Across town, Kwon Young Chul, executive director of Daewoo
Group's Moscow office, has just seen his first joint venture
with a Soviet partner collapse. After months of negotiation
and planning, the state tourism company, Intourist, withdrew
from a project to build a $75 million hotel in Moscow with
Daewoo. The two sides disagreed on which party was going to
operate it.
   "Intourist pulled out at the last minute because we
insisted on Daewoo having management rights," says Mr. Kwon.
"They wouldn't agree. They are accustomed to running hotels
themselves."
   As South Koreans back home grow increasingly giddy at the
prospect of normalized relations and lucrative economic
tie-ups with the Soviet Union, those who have already tried
for such links are grappling with daunting realities. "We
have serious problems to resolve," says Daewoo's Mr. Kwon:
"How to operate in this environment, how to make a profit and
how to get that profit back to our country and our company."
   Mr. Kwon and other Korean executives are finding that
trying to conclude contracts with the Soviets, or just
obtaining clear answers about who has the authority to make
decisions, is a frustrating process rife with ambiguity,
uncertainty and dead ends. In the midst of the great economic
and political upheavals wracking the Soviet Union, Korean
executives say, relationships are fraught with unrealistic
expectations on both sides, diplomatic confusion and mutual
misunderstanding and suspicion.
   "It's reality time for South Koreans trying to operate in
the Soviet Union," says Dieter Mann, a West German consultant
hired to help a Seoul business group establish a base in
Moscow. He says Koreans are discovering what Western and
Japanese businessmen learned long ago: "Nothing works here.
For the can-do Koreans, this is very difficult to accept."
   Those problems have been compounded by recent Soviet
acknowledgments that the nation's economy is in critical
condition and that Moscow is having trouble paying its debts.
Some Korean businessmen haven't been paid for months, says
the state-financed Korean Trade Promotion Corp., which
estimates unpaid Soviet bills at $30 million. For South
Korean companies, whose government still has no diplomatic
relations with Moscow and thus no legal way to collect on
failed investments, the collection problems have cooled the
urge to rush into major commitments.
   Soviet and Korean officials add that those problems have
been exacerbated by conflicting signals from Seoul and Moscow
over the progress toward normalization of relations. They
complain particularly that Kim Young Sam, co-leader of South
Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party, raised false hopes
about the speed of normalization during his visit to Moscow
in March and that those hopes have been fanned by the Korean
media into unrealistic expectations.
   "Things are moving a lot slower than most people in Seoul
want to believe," says Sung Jung Hyun, who directs the
state-run Korea Trade Promotion Corp., or Kotra, the official
liaison agency for economic dealings between the two
countries. The one bright spot, he says, is trade.
   Mr. Sung notes that trade between the two countries, while
still a negligible portion of the total exports and imports
for each, is rising sharply. Starting in the late 1970s, with
indirect exchanges of goods through third countries, trade
between Moscow and Seoul had by last year grown to $510
million, more than double the 1988 level. Mr. Sung forecasts
that the exchange of goods will reach $800 million this year,
$350 million in Korean exports to Moscow and $450 million in
Soviet exports to Seoul.
   In contrast to the Koreans' optimism about trade, several
Japanese trading houses notified their government last week
that some of their Soviet trading partners are delaying
payment on import contracts. The Japanese companies are
seeking to claim export insurance on trade with the Soviet
Union.
   Nevertheless, for individual South Korean companies, the
mounting trade is a hopeful sign. Daewoo's Mr. Kwon says that
in 1989, his group sold $20 million in goods to the Soviets.
It expects to triple that this year, mostly in motors,
electric and electronic goods, and consumer items such as
socks and razors, which are scarce in the Soviet Union.
   Gratifying as the progress in trade is, however, the chief
economic interest of both countries and their companies is
Korean investment in the Soviet Union. And that investment
remains more talk than action.
   A year after Seoul's Jindo Corp. signed the first
Soviet-South Korean joint venture, an $800,000 fur shop in
Moscow, no other Korean company has followed with further
investment, Mr. Sung says.
   Daewoo, Lucky-Goldstar and Seoul's two biggest
conglomerates, Hyundai and Samsung, have established a
presence in Moscow during the past year, along with Jindo, to
pursue a broad range of investments. Two others, the Kolon
and Sunkyong groups, are in line for Soviet approval to do so
soon. And there is much talk about deals in the pipeline,
with Samsung, Hyundai Group, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar now
boasting long lists of joint-venture projects in various
stages of negotiation or study.
   Lucky-Goldstar's Mr. Lee says he has more than 10 in the
works, including a plan to manufacture and assemble home
appliances for which the group has signed a letter of intent.
Samsung and Hyundai say each has eight or nine projects under
discussion. Daewoo's Mr. Kwon says he is talking with Soviet
counterparts "about 100 projects of all types and sizes."
   Yet, the Soviet Institute of World Economic and
International Relations, the state agency chiefly responsible
for monitoring the budding business relationship with South
Korea, says it knows of only about a dozen projects making
serious progress.
