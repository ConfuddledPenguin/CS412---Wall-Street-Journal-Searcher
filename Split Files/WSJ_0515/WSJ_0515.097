   Residential Resources Mortgage Investments Corp., a
Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mortgage-investment company that
filed for bankruptcy-law protection in January 1989, said
that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix accepted the
company's submitted plan for reorganization.
   The plan provides, among other things, that shareholders
retain their common-stock rights in the real estate
investment trust. It also calls for certain secured creditors
to receive warrants to acquire as much as 30% of the
company's common stock. Also, certain unsecured creditors
will receive cash payments within 30 days of about 65 cents
on the dollar for their claims, the company said.

   After making the payments, the company will have "very
nominal net worth and assets" of less than half a million
dollars, said Thomas T. Hammond, Residential's chairman. He
said he intends "to explore every alternative to attract new
capital to the company but no such commitments exist at this
time."
