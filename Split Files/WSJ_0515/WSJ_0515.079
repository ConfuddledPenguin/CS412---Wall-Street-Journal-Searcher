   Investors in nearly $3 billion of real estate limited
partnerships are likely to see management control of them
change hands in coming months.
   Integrated Resources Inc., Southmark Corp. and
Consolidated Capital Equities Corp., which are all operating
under federal bankruptcy protection, plan to sell their
general-partner interests in a total of 242 partnerships.

   Buyers will acquire the sponsors' rights to millions of
dollars in future management fees. They will also get other
assets, including loans to the partnerships and equity
interests in their properties.
   None of the three sponsors has contacted the thousands of
individuals who invested in the syndications as limited
partners to tell them about the sales. Integrated disclosed
its plans in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. But
Southmark and Consolidated Capital say it would be premature
for them to do so, even though both companies say they have
had preliminary discussions with potential buyers.
   A change in management control could be a blessing for
investors in some troubled partnerships. Although the
Integrated partnerships are healthy, analysts say, some of
the Southmark and Consolidated Capital partnerships aren't.
Strong new management could provide the resources to address
at least some of the problems.
   But while all three sponsors say they will seek
experienced, qualified buyers with the goal of maximizing the
value of the partnerships' assets, there are no guarantees.
The syndicators' own immediate interest is in getting the
highest bid for the assets to pay off bankruptcy creditors.
   Moreover, while investors will be directly affected by any
management changes, some may not even be given a chance to
express an opinion.
   Dallas-based Consolidated Capital's bankruptcy judge has
ordered the company to seek investors' approval of their new
general partner by proxy solicitation. But New York-based
Integrated says it doesn't plan to ask investors to approve
the buyer it recommends to the bankruptcy court.
   Whether Southmark's investors have a say will vary, the
company says, depending on the offers it gets. The company,
which is based in Dallas, adds that some of its partnership
agreements, which are the legal contracts between general
partners and limited partners, may require a vote depending
on how control of the partnership changes hands.
   Partnership analysts, industry officials and even
potential buyers say investors should be more involved in the
process. While general partners typically own just 1% of a
partnership, effectively they run the show. "Legally, they
have huge discretion," to make practically all the decisions,
says Spencer Jefferies, a Dallas partnership analyst who
first reported Southmark's planned sale in his newsletter.
   Any time a partnership changes hands, much of the cost is
paid by the partnership and, thus, by the investors, says
Chicago lawyer and consultant Laura Ricciardelli. "Like the
wind-down and start-up phases of any business, these
transitions are extremely expensive," she says.
   Unlike stockholders in public companies who can protest a
management change by selling their shares, limited partners
have few alternatives. Partnerships are long-term
investments, which typically require investors to lock up
their money for seven to 10 years. Investors who want out
before then generally have to resort to an informal resale
market, where most partnership interests sell at steep
discounts from their original offering prices.
   A variety of potential suitors are seeking control of all
three sponsors' partnerships. They include other syndicators,
as well as present or former executives of the companies.
Bankruptcy lawyers say they expect proxy fights over many
partnerships to develop between competing bidders.
   The huge sales come at a time when many other syndicators,
whose business boomed through the mid-1980s, are now
troubled. If the sales are successful, analysts predict there
will be more. Integrated itself has interests in more than
600 partnerships, only four of which are involved in the
planned sales.
   Integrated is selling its interests in four of its large
public offerings, American Insured Mortgage Investors, sold
in the 1980s. The partnerships, which hold federally insured
mortgages, raised $789 million from 66,000 investors.
   Southmark is offering its interests in 222 partnerships,
most of which were private syndications sold to wealthy
individuals. The partnerships were marketed under such
banners as Southmark/Envicon, McNeil, University and
Southmark Capital starting in the late 1970s. The company's
management interests in the syndications are being sold
together with $240 million of loans the partnerships owe
Southmark. The company values them at $35 million because
many are delinquent.
   Another 175,000 investors who put $1.1 billion into 16
public partnerships sponsored by Consolidated Capital, a
former Southmark affiliate, are facing their fourth change in
general partners in the past five years. Three of the
partnerships sold in the early 1980s strictly hold mortgages,
while the rest own apartments and offices. Some are sick and
some aren't, says Boe Martin, the company's bankruptcy
lawyer.
   Bankruptcy attorneys say they expect the sales to help
define the rights of limited partners, which today are often
unclear and only get murkier if the general partner is
insolvent.
   For instance, New York Judge Howard C. Buschman III gave
Integrated the choice of involving investors in its sale,
declining to address that issue. The Investment Partnership
Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group protested that
the ruling could set a bad precedent.
   Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated's chairman, says "we've
put provisions in to protect" investors, including hiring an
outsider to review offers submitted in a formal,
court-approved auction. It was designed to "make it
difficult" for somebody "trying to start a proxy battle,
where we would get a lot less," says Mr. Weinroth. He adds
that Integrated thought investors might have rejected its
choice of a new general partner and that the partnership
agreements don't require investor approval of a change.
   Consolidated Capital's attorney Mr. Martin says the
company had intended to consult limited partners "through a
modified disclosure statement," but its bankruptcy Judge
Steven A. Felsenthal felt that wasn't enough.
   Judge Felsenthal is also supervising Southmark's
bankruptcy and must approve a sale of its general-partner
interests. As most of those are private partnerships,
however, "he might render the opposite result," and not
require an investor vote, says Mr. Martin.
