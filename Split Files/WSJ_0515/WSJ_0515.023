   ARLINGTON, Va. -- The Gannett Foundation selected Salomon
Brothers Inc. to handle the proposed sale of its 10%
ownership of Gannett Co.
   Foundation officials said they would prefer to sell the
block back to Gannett, though it was unclear whether the
media company has the capital to purchase so many shares.

   The foundation put its 15.9 million shares of Gannett
stock on the block late last month because it wanted to
diversify its assets and seek a higher return.
