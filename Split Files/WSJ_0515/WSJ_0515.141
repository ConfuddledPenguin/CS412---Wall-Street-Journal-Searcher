   FRANKFURT -- The West German economy grew 2.5% in the
first quarter of 1990 from the fourth quarter of 1989 after
price and seasonal adjustments, the West German Economics
Ministry said.
   The Economics Ministry said in a monthly report released
yesterday that it now sees gross national product (GNP)
growth for the full year of between 3.5% and 4%. That follows
suggestions from Deutsche Bundesbank Vice President Helmut
Schlesinger, who in a speech last Thursday said GNP would
grow by "about 4%" in 1990.

   In January, the Economics Ministry forecast that GNP would
grow 3% in 1990. But by March, officials were indicating that
that forecast, made before the proposal to introduce the
Deutsche mark into East Germany, was in need of upward
revision.
   In February, the Economics Ministry said that fourth
quarter GNP grew 1% in the fourth quarter from the third
quarter.
