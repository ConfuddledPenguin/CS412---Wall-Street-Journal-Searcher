   NEW YORK -- Wilfred American Educational Corp., the
beauty-school operator, sought protection against lawsuits
from creditors by filing under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law.
   "The company was compelled to take this action" for a
number of reasons, said Philip E. Jakeway Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer. These include denials of the
company's claims for reimbursement by the federal Education
Department. Wilfred derives much of its revenue from
government student-loan programs. Also forcing the filing
were legal costs, operating losses and changes in government
policies, Mr. Jakeway said in a statement. Wilfred officials
were unavailable for comment.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Wilfred's shares closed unchanged at 56.25 cents. The Big
Board said yesterday that in light of the bankruptcy-law
filing, it is reviewing whether to continue listing Wilfred's
shares.
   The company's problems stem from an October 1988
indictment of Mr. Jakeway and a number of other employees. A
Tampa, Fla., federal grand jury charged them with misusing
financial-aid funds. In March 1989, nine of the other
employees entered so-called Alford pleas, agreeing to plead
guilty to certain charges but denying any wrongdoing. The
trial for the remaining defendants is scheduled for January
1991.
   In October 1989, a federal grand jury in Massachusetts
indicted the company on mail fraud charges. The company
denied the charges, and the case is scheduled for trial in
June.
