   LOS ANGELES -- Fox Television Stations Inc. said it
completed the sale of Boston TV station WFXT to a limited
partnership of the Boston Celtics basketball team. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   The sale was required under a divestiture order by the
Federal Communications Commission, Fox Television said. FCC
rules prohibit a company from owning a television station and
newspaper in the same market. Rupert Murdoch's Sydney,
Australia-based News Corp., owns Fox Television and the
Boston Herald newspaper.
