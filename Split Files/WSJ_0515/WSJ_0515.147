   NEW YORK -- The first auction of impressionist and modern
paintings of the spring art auction season met with dismal
results.
   Habsburg, Feldman Inc., a small, upstart Geneva-based
auction house saw only about 15% of its paintings sell here
last night.

   And while the auction was relativly small in dollar terms,
it set a somber stage for the larger multimillion dollar art
auctions to be held here at Christie's International PLC and
Sotheby's Holdings Inc. later this week.
   Art dealers stress that this first sale wasn't a true test
of the strength of the art market. They contended that unlike
the evening sales later this week, last night's auction was
filled with art works by such weaker painters as Maurice
Utrillo and Maurice de Vlaminck and by some lesser works by
such renowned painters as Claude Monet. Nonetheless, the
percentage of unsold works was almost double that of Habsburg
Feldman's similar sale in November.
   The mood of the room grew increasingly leaden as painting
after painting was passed up by bidders. At one point, to
lighten the mood, auctioneer Archduke Geza von Habsburg
reminded the crowd that bidding was allowed.
   In several cases, in a break with auction tradition,
sellers appeared to have set the minimum price they would
accept at the high end of the presale estimate. That
indicates that the auction house expected much stronger
bidding.
   The top lot of the sale was an oil on canvas of two women
painted by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It fetched $2.6 million, at
the high end of the presale estimate of $2.3 million to $2.6
million.
   The next major sale will be tonight at Christie's. Up for
bid is Vincent van Gogh's evocative and melancholic
masterpiece "The Portrait of Doctor Gachet." It is estimated
to sell for $40 million or more.
