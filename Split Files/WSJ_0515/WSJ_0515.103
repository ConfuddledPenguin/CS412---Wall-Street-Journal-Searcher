   SAN FRANCISCO -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it cut its
rating on Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s senior debt to single-A-plus
from double-A-minus.
   The rating concern also downgraded the banking company's
commercial paper to single-A-minus from single-A-plus,
preferred stock to single-A-minus from single-A, and
letter-of-credit-backed issues to single-A-plus from
double-A-minus. In all, about $3.7 billion in debt is
affected.

   S&amp;P said the cuts reflect its concerns about the potential
effects of Wells Fargo's high exposure to commercial real
estate, as well as a major commitment to lending for highly
leveraged transactions.
   In a statement, Carl E. Reichardt, Wells Fargo's chairman,
described the S&amp;P action as "inappropriate."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Wells Fargo shares closed at $73.50, down $1.375.
