   NEW YORK -- TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.
reported first-quarter net income of $133,000 compared with a
year-ago $580,000 net loss.
   Operating profit and sales improved in both of TLC's
segments -- food distribution and grocery products -- and
favorable currency translations also helped results, the
company said.

   On a per-share basis, TLC posted a first-quarter loss of
23 cents, reflecting $2.3 million of preferred-stock
dividends. The year-earlier loss equaled 25 cents a share.
TLC's shares are closely held.
   Sales climbed 25% to $310.4 million from $248.3 million.
   "While we expect excellent results for the remainder of
the year," said Reginald F. Lewis, chief executive officer,
"our second- and third-quarter figures will determine our
full-year performance because our ice-cream and dessert
products are sold during the warm-weather period." TLC sells
a number of European food products including Tato snack foods
in Ireland and Samson ice cream in Italy.
   In December, TLC canceled a proposed initial public
offering as large investors shunned the plan. The company,
formed two years prior as an investor group led by Mr. Lewis
purchased what had been the foreign-food lines of Beatrice
Cos. from investment bank Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
