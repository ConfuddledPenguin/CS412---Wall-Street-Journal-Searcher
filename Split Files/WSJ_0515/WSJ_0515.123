   Mission Insurance Group Inc. said a federal court approved
the company's rehabilitation agreement for unit Mission
Insurance Cos. that, among other things, calls for the
transfer of $29 million in assets to government trusts.
   The Los Angeles-based insurer has been in bankruptcy-law
proceedings since 1987. Its insolvency was one of the largest
insurance-company failures in history.

<TEXT>
   The California Insurance Commission must resolve certain
tax issues in connection with the plan.
   Under the plan, the assets and liabilities of Mission
Insurance Cos. will be transferred to trusts overseen by the
California insurance commissioner. The transfer is to include
$14 million in cash and 5.9 million Mission Insurance Group
common shares, representing about 29% of the stock
outstanding.
