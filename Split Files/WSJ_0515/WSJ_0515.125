   NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil suit in federal court in Manhattan accusing Ahmad
Bayaa, the president of Southland Communications Inc., and
five others of a scheme to manipulate the price of Southland
Communications stock.
   The SEC suspended trading in Southland Communications, a
Santa Ana, Calif., company that leases pagers, in early April
because of questions about control of the company's stock. In
the civil suit, the agency accused the defendants of
arranging transactions to boost the price of the securities
by "creating the false illusion of widespread market
interest." The suit also accuses them of violating securities
law by not disclosing that they controlled more than 5% of
the stock.

   Ahmad Bayaa and other Southland Communications officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
   The SEC alleges in the suit that the price of Southland
Communications securities almost doubled between March 13 and
April 3, although there were no positive company developments
to account for the price rise. The lawsuit charged that the
stock price was manipulated in the face of heavy short
selling, which usually indicates that investors expect the
price of a security to decline.
