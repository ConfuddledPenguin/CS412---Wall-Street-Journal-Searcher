   Waring &amp; LaRosa, a tiny New York ad agency that just last
year seemed near death's door, continued its startling
turnaround by picking up more than $20 million in
Fisher-Price toys business.
   Fisher-Price, a unit of Quaker Oats, said it would
consolidate all of its domestic consumer advertising with
Waring &amp; LaRosa, which already handles its $12 million infant
toys account. According to Leading National Advertisers,
Fisher-Price spent $36.7 million on advertising in 1989, but
industry executives said it is spending less this year,
reflecting lower toy sales.

   The account had been split between Waring & LaRosa; Backer
Spielvogel Bates, which had the $15 million to $20 million
traditional toy account for toddlers; and J. Walter
Thompson's Chicago office, which created ads for promotional
products, an account billing just under $5 million.
   The Fisher-Price victory is the latest in a string of new
accounts for Waring &amp; LaRosa. In March, Perrier -- which
fired the ad agency in 1986 -- brought back its $8 million to
$10 million account to the shop to help with Perrier's
relaunch. Variations of an early 1980s Waring spot, featuring
a cartoon caveman discovering "the earth's first soft drink,"
are airing now. The Progresso sauce and Sunshine biscuit
accounts also signed on in the past six months.
   The agency also is a contender for the Heublein account,
including Finlandia vodka and Jose Cuervo tequila. And it was
a finalist in the hotly contested Reebok account, which
ultimately was awarded to Hill, Holliday, Connors,
Cosmopulos. Waring &amp; LaRosa, which by last fall had shrunk to
less than $50 million in billings, now bills well over $70
million, says Joseph LaRosa, chairman and creative director.
   The ad agency's winning streak is that much more
surprising considering how rocky its history has been over
the past few years. The agency, formed by partners Saul
Waring and Mr. LaRosa in 1968, quickly developed a hot
creative reputation, as did some others formed around the
same time, such as Scali, McCabe, Sloves. But Waring &amp;
LaRosa's fortunes took a turn for the worse in the early
1980s after it sold itself to BBDO, which subsequently became
part of the Omnicom Group.
   Soon after BBDO bought it, Waring's largest client,
Chesebrough-Pond's, pulled almost all of its account,
including the Aziza cosmetics, Cutex nail products, and
Prince tennis racket accounts. Fisher-Price, another major
client, pulled a big piece of its account next, with the
final blow coming when Perrier fired the agency.
   Meanwhile, attempts to win new business seemed blocked at
every turn, because almost every product category was already
handled by Omnicom's bigger ad units. Waring &amp; LaRosa had
lengthy discussions with Porsche, and received a letter of
interest from Jaguar, but couldn't take on a car account
because of bigger automotive accounts elsewhere within
Omnicom. "Every time we turned around we had a conflict," Mr.
LaRosa says.
   As a result, Waring, which billed $100 million when BBDO
bought it, billed just $50 million by early last year, when
it bought back its independence. Going it alone, though, at
first seemed just as miserable. Last November, Waring again
lost its largest account when Ragu, which at its height had
billed over $20 million, fired the agency.
   Since then, though, the agency has had a Phoenix-like
rise. Mr. LaRosa attributes the wave of new business to the
agency's emphasis on building brands, and to the fact that,
finally, it isn't saddled with conflicts.
   "Clients are starting to look for people like us. The
companies coming to us are packaged goods companies that want
good creative work," Mr. LaRosa says. "We think we've
overcome the odds."
   The Fisher-Price consolidation came as a shock to Backer
Spielvogel Bates. Backer attributed the move to a management
change in Fisher-Price's marketing department. David Fisher,
who had been executive vice president of North American
operations, resigned several weeks ago, and his advertising
duties were taken over by Strawn Cathcart, vice president of
marketing. Quaker recently announced plans to spin off
Fisher-Price.
   "The loss . . . came as a total surprise," a Backer
spokeswoman said. "The decision was certainly not a
reflection of the quality of our work . . . which has always
been superior, but a change in marketing management at
Fisher-Price." Backer continues to handle Fisher-Price's
advertising in Europe.
   Mr. Cathcart said the toy company decided to consolidate
at Waring &amp; LaRosa because the agency, which first took on
the account in 1969 when Fisher-Price was a small regional
company, helped build its national presence almost from
scratch. "We're going back to basics," Mr. Cathcart said,
"and we feel very comfortable putting our image into the
hands of the people who developed the business."

   FILM ADVERTISING: Spot television and the broadcast TV
networks posted the biggest dollar gains in the ad budgets of
U.S. film distributors in 1989, according to an analysis by
Blair Television. Spot TV spending last year jumped 15% to
$180 million, up from $156 million. Network ad spending by
the major film companies increased 14% to $207 million, up
from $181 million in 1988. Newspaper ad spending edged up to
$149 million from $147 million a year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   MERGER: DDB Needham, an Omnicom Group agency, said it
reached an agreement to merge Broucc DDB Needham, its office
in Milan, Italy, with Verba, another shop in Milan. The
agency, which will have billings of $100 million, will be
called Verba DDB Needham. Terms weren't disclosed.
