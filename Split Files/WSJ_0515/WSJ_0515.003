   Philadelphia -- Someone told me that if I wanted to really
understand basketball, I should pick one player in a game and
watch his every move. So for the first quarter of the
Philadelphia 76ers-Chicago Bulls NBA playoff contest Sunday
afternoon at the Spectrum, I watched the Sixers' Rick Mahorn.
   He seemed a logical-enough choice. He's a veteran, a
former member of last season's champion Detroit Pistons, and
has a nice smile, or, at least, a toothy sneer. Moreover, his
dedication to these proceedings seemed to assure an all-out
effort. He has said his playoff preparations included the
home-front proclamation that "this is no time for little,
nit-picking things.

   "This is not the time for `Oh honey, you've got to cut the
grass,'" he declared. "It is not the time for `You go pick up
so and so.'" Any man willing to risk talking that way to his
wife must be serious.
   Among the Sunday activities of the 6' 10", 255-pound
Mahorn were these: an elbow to the neck of Bulls forward
Stacy King when the two jostled under the Bulls' goal; a
healthy shove to the back of Bulls center Bill Cartwright on
a rebound; a bit of hand-to-hand combat with the seven-foot
Cartwright, no slouch himself at the martial arts, as Mahorn
worked for offensive-rebounding position.
   No fouls were called on either side for those deeds,
following a league practice that anything that doesn't
require an eightcount needn't be punished. The NBA game has
become so ferocious it now borrows some of its terminology
from wrestling. For example, a "takedown" is what one player
does to ensure that a foe trying to reach the basket with the
ball lands on the floor instead.
   In truth, Sunday's match wasn't nasty by current
standards, and in the end Sixer fatigue, a deep Bulls bench
and an honest-to-goodness basketballer, Chicago's well-known
Michael Jordan, made the difference. Philadelphia led by nine
points going into the fourth quarter but was out-tallied
34-15 thereafter, with Marvelous Michael getting 18 of those,
and 45 in all. The final score was 111-101, and it gave the
Bulls a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven games Eastern
Conference semifinal.
   Nonetheless, Bulls coach Phil Jackson couldn't resist a
pugilistic image when he delivered his post-game assessment.
"I didn't think they had the bench to stay with us," he said.
"If you can get past the 10th round with those guys, you can
beat them."
   Ed Nealy, a burly Chicago reserve whose nine points and as
many rebounds came in handy for his team, essentially agreed.
"When you bang like they do, it's going to wear you down," he
offered. "We needed our reinforcements. We kind of
outnumbered them today."
   The attention to rough stuff in this playoff season is an
offshoot of the regular campaign's end, which was marked by
several incidents of the sort that sensible men avoid while
clad in their underwear. One bout between the Sixers and
Pistons, who have popularized basket-brawl in recent seasons,
resulted in a record $162,500 in fines being levied against
the teams and various players. A couple weeks later, the
fourth and final game of the Bulls-Milwaukee Bucks
first-round playoff series was marked by 68 personal fouls
plus six of the "technical" variety (for extracurricular
fighting or mouthing-off to the refs), and 96 free throws.
   These prompted Rod Thorn, the NBA's operations chief, to
deplore the trend toward "ridiculously hard fouls" that spur
altercations. He didn't, however, spell out when a foul
becomes "hard" or "ridiculously hard." Until the league can
make and enforce simple distinctions between fair and foul,
it's no wonder that more advanced definitions remain elusive.
   So we can only hope that the short-pants millionaires
escape unscathed until these proceedings end sometime in
June, and in winning on enemy hardwood Sunday the Bulls gave
notice that they still could be in action then. Their triumph
was all the more noteworthy because it was accomplished
without starting forward Scottie Pippen, one of the most
frequent fliers in Chicago's air-oriented offense. He was in
Arkansas attending his father's funeral.
   The Bulls employed several fellas in Pippen's stead, and
all contributed. King, a 6' 10" rookie, started and had 22
points and seven rebounds. Will Perdue, the seldom-used
center with the size-22 feet, chipped in 10 points and three
rebounds in reserve. Nealy did his muscle bit, and rookie
guard B.J. Armstrong managed the ball well. In all, the Bulls
bench outscored their Sixer counterparts 23 to 10, exceeding
their team's victory margin.
   When the going got tough, though, the Bulls got going to
the 6' 6" Jordan. This is their SOP, even though their
opponents are well-aware of the proclivity. Do the Sixers
always have the Jordanian threat in the back of their minds
when they play the Bulls, Philadelphia center Mike Gminski
was asked. Nope, he replied, "He's always in the front of our
minds."
   Jordan got the Chicago comeback rolling in earnest two
minutes into the last period, when his three-point goal cut
the Sixers' lead to four. He scored five more baskets in the
quarter, all on driving layups past the fagged
Philadelphians. His method on those was to dribble the ball
around the perimeter of the Sixers' defense until he spotted
an opening, and then zip through it. The home team couldn't
catch him, much less take him down.
   Some of those drives were past Charles Barkley, the
broad-beamed Philly hero, and his late futility epitomized
that of his team. He is far and away the leading Sixer scorer
and rebounder in the series, but he played 46 of the 48
minutes Sunday, on top of 45, 45 and 41 minutes in the
previous three games, and Jordan said the toil told.
   "When Charles talks on the court, you know he's motivated,
energized," said Michael. "He got pretty quiet in the fourth
quarter today."
