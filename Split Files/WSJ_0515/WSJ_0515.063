   BRASILIA -- Brazil this week will begin lifting
restrictions on computer imports and open the market to
foreign multinationals to modernize its outdated industrial
sector, a top official said.
   "Protectionism has created complacent producers and
consumers," said Science and Technology Secretary Jose
Goldemberg.

   Brazil will publish a list Thursday of 57 products that
would no longer receive subsidies and market protection,
ranging from eight-bit microcomputers used for entertainment
to low resolution monitors and non-laser printers.
   This will open the market to identical products
manufactured abroad. But these products will be charged
import duties and excise taxes, he said.
   The U.S. has been pressing Brazil to phase out subsidies
for Brazilian makers of high-tech products and to open up the
market to foreign competition.
