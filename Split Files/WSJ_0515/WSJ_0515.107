   Metrobank Financial Group Inc., citing a soft real estate
market, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $18 million, or $9.75
a share, and said it expects further losses unless the market
improves.
   The loss included a $16.5 million addition to reserves to
cover possible loan losses. Nonperforming assets totaled
$42.4 million as of the end of 1989. A year earlier,
Palisades Park, N.J.-based Metrobank earned $752,000, or 41
cents a share.

   Metrobank said that it may not meet the new regulatory
capital requirements imposed on all savings associations by
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement
Act of 1989. As a result, the company said, Metrobank may be
subject to supervisory action by federal officials.
   Metrobank also announced that as a result of restrictions
on commercial lending, Malcolm Marsa has left as chairman and
and chief executive officer. His brother Paul resigned as a
director.
   Michael P. Scaduto, president and chief operating officer,
was named to the additional post of chief exectutive; and
attorney Berek P. Don of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., already a
director, was named chairman.
