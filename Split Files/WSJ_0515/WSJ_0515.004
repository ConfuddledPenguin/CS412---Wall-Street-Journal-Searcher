   Varian Associates Inc. moved to improve flagging profit
and distance itself from the weakening defense business,
announcing plans to eliminate 600 jobs and sell operations
with annual sales of $200 million by the end of September.
   The moves will sharply reduce Varian's costs and its
dependence on military contracts, but require it to take a
one-time pretax charge of $74 million for its fiscal third
quarter ending June 29.

   The Palo Alto, Calif., concern currently has about 12,000
employees.
   The size of the charge was a surprise -- almost twice as
big as what some analysts had expected. But the market
welcomed the news. Varian's stock rose 87.5 cents, to $26, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   "This will boost profits quite dramatically," said Michael
Lauer, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Net income at Varian, a diversified high-technology
concern, has fallen for four consecutive quarters, and in
March the company named J. Tracy O'Rourke its new chief
executive officer and chairman. In a prepared statement, Mr.
O'Rourke said the job cuts were dictated by the need to
reduce costs and that the operations offered for sale aren't
part of the company's core businesses, which include medical
therapy and semiconductor process equipment.
   Mr. O'Rourke came to Varian from Rockwell International
Corp., where he had a reputation for turning industry trends
to his company's advantage. While president of Allen-Bradley
Co., which Rockwell acquired in 1985, Mr. O'Rourke was
credited with helping transform the private electromechanical
concern with $450 million in annual sales into a $1.4 billion
global high-tech supplier.
   At Varian, Mr. O'Rourke wants to lead "a pared-down"
organization that can better manage rapid changes in markets
and technologies. "A number of these activities we plan to
exit should repesent interesting opportunities for others,"
he said. "But in our particular situation, they proved to be
a diversion that was no longer acceptable or affordable."
   Mr. Lauer, the analyst, said he expects Varian to receive
as much as $70 million to $85 million from these operations,
which employ about 1,600 people and largely make products
purchased by the military. The operations include Continental
Electronics in Dallas, TVT Ltd. in Cambridge, England, and
two units in Northern California that make night-vision
goggles and radiation-resistant semiconductors for the
military.
   Varian hopes to complete the sale of these units, which
account for about one-seventh of its annual revenue, by the
end of September, when the company ends its fiscal year. But
a spokesman said it could take longer than that to complete
the sales and that it was prepared to operate the units until
buyers were found.
   The sale of these operations should help earnings because
they were expected to have losses of as much as $10 million
this year, Mr. Lauer said. Varian's profit also will benefit
from the job cuts, which Mr. Lauer said should save the
company $20 million in annual costs.
   While these savings will ease the pressue on Varian, they
won't take the company out of the woods. The company also
must improve its pivotal semiconductor equipment operation,
which has suffered from weakened demand and troubles in
finishing new products.
   Mr. Lauer said that because of unsolved technical
difficulties the company has a backlog of two dozen orders
for one important product, which is priced at more than $1
million. In the area of chip equipment, "what's killing the
company are technical issues," he said.
   A spokesman for Varian said the company had sold about 30
of the machines, but called it a "tough new product." He said
"we believe those problems are getting sorted out . . . those
are largely behind us now."
