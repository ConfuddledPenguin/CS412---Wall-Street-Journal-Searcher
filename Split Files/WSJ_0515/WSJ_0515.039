   Los Angeles -- Self-absorbed, a blond indigena fondles her
locks as she stops alongside us for a traffic light on the
Pacific Coast Highway. On the hill heading up to Malibu
North, a brunette in a black convertible lets her long hair
fly wild, perhaps in order to cultivate the look one sees in
fashionable cafes: tangled, witchy black wires that must be
impossible to comb.
   But we aren't here (primarily) for the blonds and
brunettes who tool along the coast. We are here to hear
Domingo &amp; Co. singing Verdi (when they should have been
singing Tchaikovsky); to sample a series of absurdist plays
of the '50s and '60s playing in rep at the Mark Taper Forum;
to see the Francis Bacon retrospective at the Los Angeles
County Museum. We are here to look at new buildings and taste
the good life, and to do all this in three days, because we
work very hard at our culture in Southern California.

   Placido Domingo, who has been listed as "artistic
consultant" to the Los Angeles Music Center Opera since it
was founded four years ago, was originally scheduled to sing
his first Ghermann in "Queen of Spades" (or "Pikovaya Dama,"
if you like, since he was to sing it in Russian).
   On Jan. 26, with all the artists engaged and sets under
construction, Mr. Domingo announced that an attack of flu
would prevent him from learning the part in time. The company
decided to scrap the opera and find another that Mr. Domingo
already knew. "True to history," grumbled local critic Martin
Bernheimer, "Los Angeles has once again catered to a star
ego."
   For all the haste and confusion, the result was very
happy. "Don Carlo" is a better opera than "Queen of Spades"
after all, and the production, borrowed in frantic haste from
the Lyric Opera of Chicago, did it justice. Although he got
most of the bravos and bouquets, Mr. Domingo was only one
among six nearly equal leads in this hard-to-cast work,
singing with his usual ringing splendor, acting a bit
hammily. The four variously tormented Spanish royals and
nobles around him were all from the U.S.S.R., as was the
excellent conductor, Yuri Simonov of the Bolshoi Opera. (Mr.
Simonov and Natalia Troitskaya, who played Elisabetta, had
originally been booked for "Queen of Spades.") The other
Soviets -- Nina Terentieva, making her U.S. debut as Eboli;
Barseg Tumanyan as King Philip; and Vladimir Chernov as
Rodrigo -- were brought in partly because they were
available. Unlike major western singers, they hadn't locked
their singing dates in place years in advance. All of them
were far better than average singers (if not actors), and got
across the majesty and power of Verdi's grand l9th-century
political statement.
   Across the dancing waters fountain from the opera, the
cylindrical, intimate Mark Taper Forum had taken the
wonderful risk of putting on 53 performances of 13 short
plays by Beckett, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter, Albee, Baraka and
Shepard, all written between 1947 and 1966.
   I saw only one of the six programs, of Mr. Albee's "The
American Dream" of 1961 and Mr. Pinter's "A Slight Ache" of
1959. The Albee seemed as bitter, unresolved, and in some
ways simplistic as when I first saw it almost 30 years ago.
But good actors and a good director can still make Mr.
Albee's nasty stereotypes hurt. "A Slight Ache" is Mr.
Pinter's flawless image of an insufferably proper pair of
British suburbanites, stripped to their manic inner selves by
the presence of an unspeaking vagrant. Director Michael
Arabian realized it perfectly, through the agency of actors
Bill Moor and Angela Paton. Ms. Paton, who salvaged "The
American Dream" with an outrageous, vaudevillian performance,
offered a one-woman demonstration of the vitality and pain
that endures in these small landmarks of the 20th-century
theater's coming of age.
   The Francis Bacon retrospective achieved something of the
same effect: a reminder that an artist who reached his peak
in the 1950s and '60s can have an awesome, even devastating
effect on contemporary viewers. Super-cool modern critics
profess to find Mr. Bacon's images of tormented, melting,
dismembered human bodies in their stage-set cages and arenas
to be dated period pieces from the angstridden, existential
'50s, out of tune with our cynical post-modern sensibilities.
But they certainly still bother me.
   His most recent work does seem more mellow and less
complex than his classic early triptychs (one of which sold
last year for $6 million). But I would no more fault Mr.
Bacon for the consistency of his vision and method than I
would Giacometti or Chagall. If he is "out of touch" with
contemporary trends, he has been all along. The art world
knows no more dedicated, trend-defying loner. At the Grand
Palais in Paris in 1971, I was stunned to near nightmare by
the sheer horror of what he did to human forms, by what his
perversions seemed to imply. At the Los Angeles museum in
1990, the horrors were still there. But now I realized more
clearly that what kept them just this side of unbearable,
what kept one staring at them, in fact, was the unerring
finesse of Mr. Bacon's craft. Is there anyone alive who knows
how to select colors, arrange compositions, apply paint as
well as this unhappy English octogenarian? The show, which
began at the Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., in
October 1989, goes on to depress viewers at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York from May 24 to Aug. 28.
   I had hoped to tour Charles Moore's new fantasy palazzos
at the Beverly Hills Civic Center. But seven years and many
millions after ground-breaking, all that seems to be finished
is the parking garage: perhaps another indication of local
priorities. So I settled instead for Rebecca's restaurant
near Venice Beach, designed in 1986 by Los Angeles's current
most-fashionable architect, Frank Gehry. Local restaurant
critics praise its expensive Nuevo Mexicano cuisine (lobster
tacos, crab enchiladas, duck rellenos), but, as the owner
complains, no one really comes for the food.
   We come to stare at the decor, and at each other. The open
stainless steel kitchen, crowded with sweating cooks, and the
marble-paneled ceviche bar are contained in two little
free-standing houses. A shiny pavilion of pure copper rises
in one corner on the booze bar. A row of fat telephone pole
columns sprouting branches pretends to hold up the roof.
Ducts are, of course, exposed, stairs are industrial metal.
The decorations include two giant plastic black alligators
and a ruby-and-gold octopus hanging from the ceiling, a long,
long sparkly painting on black velvet, a quilted metal door,
and roll-back aqua booths.
   Elizabeth Taylor uses Booth 1, I was told, but the night I
was there no stars were in sight. All the women in the
jam-packed bar looked like that Medusa-haired brunette in the
convertible at Malibu, all the men like GQ '90s versions of
Edward Albee's "American Dream." None of them smiled. The
Venice regulars make one feel very old.
