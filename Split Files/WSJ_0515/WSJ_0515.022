   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department urged Congress to
require the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and five other government-sponsored
enterprises to qualify for and obtain triple-A credit ratings
-- without factoring in the government's implicit guarantee.
   In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee's
oversight panel, Robert R. Glauber, Treasury undersecretary
for finance, said the Treasury believes a triple-A rating
from at least two major credit-rating concerns "represents
the most safe and sound level of credit quality, and thereby
the best protection from potential risk."

   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy home loans from lenders and
package some into securities for sale to investors and hold
the rest in portfolio. The two entities together purchase
about one-fourth of the nation's home loans. Stricter
standards raise concerns that homeowners' costs could
increase or that the two corporations might be forced to curb
their purchases of riskier loans, often for low-income or
moderate-income housing.
   The Treasury, however, argued that taking steps to meet
high credit-rating standards "should not increase the
borrowing costs of any government-sponsored enterprise, nor
would it significantly impair" their ability to fulfill their
missions. A triple-A rating, Mr. Glauber testified, "would
only reduce the potential need for another federal rescue."
   In addition to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the group
includes the Student Loan Marketing Association, called
Sallie Mae; College Construction Loan Insurance Association,
or Connie Lee; Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp., or Farmer
Mac; Farm Credit Administration; and Federal Home Loan Banks.
   The corporations were set up by Congress to improve the
flow of money to private borrowers for agricultural loans,
housing and student loans. Under last year's legislation
rescuing the thrift industry, the Treasury was ordered to
examine taxpayers' risk posed by the seven entities.
   Credit-rating concerns rate the debt of companies,
providing a clue that investors use in trying to determine
the level of risk associated with owning a company's
securities.
   Neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac meets the triple-A
standard, and both companies said the Treasury proposal needs
further study to see how it would affect their ability to
carry out their mission of providing money for housing. "We
could live with it, but it raises a lot of questions," a
Freddie Mac spokesman said.
   Thomas Gillis, a managing director at Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., one of the major credit rating concerns, said that
meeting requirements for a triple-A rating "would not be
impossible" for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "However, they
would need to make some fairly significant changes to their
balance sheets and their operations." The changes, he said,
would probably diminish the services they offer.
   The Treasury maintained that data generated in the
credit-rating process would serve to disclose the magnitude
of the government's implicit federal subsidy.
   In addition to suggesting Congress adopt a high
credit-rating standard for the enterprises, Mr. Glauber said
the Treasury also is recommending that Congress sever ties
with any of the seven enterprises that aren't adequately
capitalized and don't meet high credit and operations
standards. The Treasury Department also concluded that the
enterprises must have "effective federal supervision."
   Mr. Glauber said some of the government-sponsored
organizations "are among the most thinly capitalized of major
U.S. financial entities," and, unlike other corporations,
"are not subject to the usual market-imposed disciplines of
increased cost or reduced access to capital as their
balance-sheet leverage increases beyond normally prudent
levels." While it may translate into better returns for
shareholders for a successful corporation, the balance-sheet
leverage "can result in tremendous pressure" for federal aid
for an unsuccessful one, he warned.
   The Treasury Department also recommended that Congress
separate regulatory authority for the corporations. Under the
proposal, the agency that monitored financial safety and
soundness standards wouldn't evaluate whether a
government-sponsored enterprise is fulfilling its
congressional mandate.
