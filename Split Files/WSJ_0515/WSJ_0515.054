   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Big O Tires Inc. said its directors
authorized it to borrow as much as $5 million so that its
employee stock ownership plan can purchase more of the
company's shares.
   The company said the approval doubles the board's previous
authorization of $2.5 million; however, the company hasn't
yet obtained a loan for the ESOP.

   The owner and franchiser of tire stores said the loan may
be used to buy stock on the open market, or from the company.
The ESOP already owns 826,843 Big O shares, or about 4.7% of
the company's stock.
