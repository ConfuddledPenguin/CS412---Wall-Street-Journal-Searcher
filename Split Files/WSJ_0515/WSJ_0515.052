   Symantec Corp., a maker of software for personal
computers, said it agreed to buy Peter Norton Computing Inc.,
a closely held software concern, for about $70 million in
stock.
   The accord is evidence that smaller software firms,
concerned over the possibility of two behemoths -- Lotus
Development Corp. and Microsoft Corp. -- dominating the
industry, are eagerly looking for acquisitions. Historically,
the business of supplying software for personal computers has
been a haven for smaller companies. Acquisitions generally
have been avoided out of a fear that they might disrupt the
sensitive process of software development.

   Symantec, of Cupertino, Calif., said shareholders of Peter
Norton Computing will receive 2.9 million shares of Symantec
common. The combined company will be the leading supplier of
a category of software called utilities, which users of
personal computers frequently buy to improve the basic
operation of their machines.
   Analysts said the accord was a surprise because Peter
Norton, of Santa Monica, Calif., until recently had been
preparing to file for an initial public stock offering of its
own. But they said that the rapid growth of Microsoft, the
biggest supplier of PC software, and last month's move by
Lotus Development to purchase Novell Inc. for $1.5 billion,
have many software companies worried that they may not
possess the size to compete effectively.
   "There's a drive towards consolidation for that very
reason," said David Readerman, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton.
   Regarding Peter Norton's preparations for an initial
public stock offering, Ron Posner, chief executive officer,
said the company even had told Salomon Brothers it would
serve as one of the underwriters.
   But Mr. Posner thinks it unlikely the offering would have
reaped more than Symantec's offer, which he describes as "the
upper end of the scale." And had the company remained
independent, he said, it needed to build a national sales
force, a costly process.
   Mr. Posner said the tie with a bigger company -- Symantec
had $50 million in sales in its fiscal year ended March 31,
twice the amount of Peter Norton -- is an important benefit
of the merger, though he said it wasn't the prime motivation
for the deal. Citing recent consolidation among distributors
of software, Mr. Posner said "getting attention at those
places takes more size than it used to."
   Symantec shares closed yesterday at $22.50, up $1, in
national over-the-counter trading.
