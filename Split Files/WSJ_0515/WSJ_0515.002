   When is a sale truly a sale?
   A state court judge in Denver could provide a
precedent-setting answer in a widely watched case scheduled
to go to trial today. The Colorado attorney general is asking
Judge Larry Naves to define a standard for determining when a
retailer promotes legitimate discounts.

   Among the criteria suggested by the state: Retailers can
advertise discounts only from higher prices at which goods
actually were sold -- not just offered for sale.
   Any ruling would apply only to the Denver-based May D&amp;F
unit of May Department Stores Co., which stands accused of
misleading Colorado consumers. But it could send shock waves
throughout the retailing industry. The Colorado attorney
general's suggested criteria are among the most detailed in
the nation. And the defendant is the nation's largest
operator of department stores.
   "The decision is going to dictate how the states act in
enforcement and how the retailers are going to advertise,"
predicts Clayton Friedman, an assistant attorney general in
Missouri.
   The Colorado case also provides a rare glimpse at how
retail price promotions really work. The state alleges that
May D&amp;F deceives consumers by artificially inflating its
"original" or "regular" prices, then promoting discounts from
those prices to create the illusion of offering bargains on
cookware, linens and other household goods. May denies the
charges, claiming in part that its practices don't violate
Federal Trade Commission guidelines.
   But rather than settling out of court as other retailers
have done in similar cases, May publicly is explaining how it
establishes "original" and "regular" prices.
   The case also comes as the Federal Trade Commission is
taking its first comprehensive look at the subject in more
than a decade. The agency is mulling comments on voluntary
advertising guidelines drawn up recently by May and other big
retailers, who are anxious to head off new state regulations.
The FTC's current guidelines, which date from 1964, require
that goods be offered for sale at regular prices "for a
reasonably substantial period of time . . . honestly and in
good faith and not for the purpose of establishing a
fictitious higher price."
   Sales are coming under more scrutiny today because they
have become so common. As competition intensified in the
1980s, stores sought an edge by running more and more
specials. That attracted the attention of state attorneys
general, who investigated the claims, started writing more
stringent rules and sued some of the most trusted names in
retailing. Cases now are pending in other states against
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., J.C. Penney Co. and other big
retailers.
   Colorado prosecutors are cutting to the heart of the
debate by suggesting that May be held to a standard of
actually selling merchandise at the higher price. "That's a
very important question," says Steven Cole, general counsel
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
   Neither prosecutors nor lawyers for May D&amp;F would comment
on the Colorado case. A spokesman for the parent company,
based in St. Louis, also declined to comment.
   In court documents, the Colorado attorney general argues
that an actual sales standard is necessary to make any
injunction against May enforceable and to match consumers'
perceptions about what constitutes a special deal. The state
says the majority of 400 Colorado consumers surveyed in March
believed that at least 25% of a retailer's sales were made at
the "original" or "regular" prices. The average consumer in
the survey understood the terms "regular" and "original" to
mean prices that were charged on 50 of the last 90 days, the
state says.
   In court documents, May D&amp;F acknowledges that before last
August, it made few sales in its Home Store departments at
what it called "original" prices. At the time, the company
says its policies required that household goods be offered
for sale at an "original" price for at least 10 days at the
beginning of each six-month season. After the 10 days, May
says its policies allowed promotions touting discounts from
the "original" price.
   May changed its policies in August (two months after it
was sued by the state) "to eliminate any doubt as to the
legitimacy of its advertising," according to the company's
court filings. Under the new policy, May says it establishes
"regular" prices by offering Home Store merchandise for sale
for at least 28 of every 90 days. And it says it instituted a
"Satisfaction Guaranteed" program allowing shoppers to return
merchandise for a full refund.
   The company defends its new policy, contending it reduced
the so-called "reference" prices the company uses to
calculate discount claims on most Home Store merchandise. The
price used to calculate discounts on a 12-cup Braun coffee
maker, for example, slid to $64 from $69 as a result of the
policy change.
   May also says in court documents that it now makes "many
sales" at its "regular" prices. In the six months ended in
March 1990, May says it sold anywhere from less than 1% to
more than 25% of the 55 best-selling Home Store items at its
"regular" prices. Still, those levels may not be high enough
to satisfy the state.
   The company maintains that consumers aren't misled by its
practices. In court documents, it cites surveys showing the
majority of consumers understood the term "original" to mean
"the first price of the season" and that 90% didn't care
whether there were actual sales at that price.
   May also argues in its filings that an actual sales
standard is unworkable and would impede price competition.
"May D&amp;F cannot control how many products it will sell at a
given price," the company says. "This will vary by the type
of product, expectations of consumers about whether they
might be able to obtain the merchandise on sale, the
competitive environment for a given product, the economy" and
other factors.
