   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court made it tougher for a
competitor to sue a distributor or manufacturer for setting
maximum retail prices.
   Although setting price ceilings may be illegal, the court
said, federal antitrust law doesn't give competitors an
automatic right to sue. Rather, the justices said in a 7-2
opinion written by Justice William Brennan, a company may sue
for damages only if it can show that it lost business because
a manufacturer set retail prices at "predatory" levels --
prices below the profit-making level and designed to drive
competitors out of business.

   Antitrust experts said the decision is a victory for
consumers because it allows manufacturers to cut their retail
prices largely without fear of lawsuits by competitors.
   The decision also was a significant victory for Atlantic
Richfield Co., which was sued by USA Petroleum Co., an
independent retailer of gasoline.
   "The decision reaffirms that consumer welfare, or prices
to consumers, are the touchstone of antitrust law," said
Charles Rule, a Washington lawyer and former Justice
Department antitrust chief. "It shows that antitrust laws
aren't designed to protect competitors without regard to how
they affect consumers," he said.
   While the high court's decision makes it more difficult
for competitors to successfully sue, it doesn't prevent
individual dealers and consumers from challenging maximum
resale prices. Dealers may allege, for example, that they
were unable to offer particular services to consumers because
they couldn't charge a high enough retail price to cover
their cost. Consumers may allege that all of the retailers
charged the maximum price set by the manufacturer,
effectively eliminating competition.
   USA Petroleum charged that Arco conspired with its own
brand-name retail gasoline dealers to drive independent
retailers out of business. USA Petroleum said Arco and its
dealers fixed maximum retail prices at levels that were below
market prices.
   A federal court in Los Angeles dismissed the suit based on
pretrial motions, finding that USA Petroleum failed to show
that it lost business because of "predatory pricing." But in
1988, a federal appeals court reinstated the suit, saying
that Arco caused USA Petroleum's business losses with its
price-fixing plan.
   Yesterday, the high court reversed the appeals court
ruling, effectively ending the lawsuit. "Low prices benefit
consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long
as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten
competition. Hence, they cannot give rise to antitrust
injury," Justice Brennan said.
   Edward G. Reilly, senior vice president of marketing for
Arco Products Co., said: "This is a great victory for
consumers and another vindication of the consumer-oriented
marketing program we embarked upon in 1982."
   Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Justice Byron
White.
   Mr. Rule said the decision is consistent with the high
court's approach for the past decade of viewing the antitrust
laws as protecting competition, rather than individual
competitors. (Atlantic Richfield Co. vs. USA Petroleum Co.)
                                                                                                       

   States' Asbestos Lawsuit
                                                                                                       

   The justices refused to allow the attorneys general of 30
states to sue in the high court to force manufacturers of
asbestos products to pay for removal of the hazardous
material from public buildings.
   The complaint was lodged against 26 companies that
manufactured products containing asbestos for decades until
the early 1970s, when the Environmental Protection Agency
identified asbestos as a cancer-causing material. The
complaint said the companies, including major manufacturers
of asbestos products for insulation, fireproofing and
interior building tiles, failed to warn state governments of
the hazards and failed to pay for its removal.
   John Ellis, deputy attorney general in the state of
Washington and an organizer of the lawsuit, estimated the
total cost of cleaning up asbestos in public buildings in the
30 states at $16 billion.
   Mr. Ellis said the case was filed directly in the Supreme
Court because no other court has jurisdiction to handle the
claims by all of the states. When the case was filed in
February, Mr. Ellis said, "Separate suits in {30} state
courts is the only alternative," noting that it would be very
costly and inefficient. Since the high court, without
comment, turned down the lawsuit, the states will have to
explore other alternatives. (Alabama vs. W.R. Grace Co.)
                                                                                                       

   Court in Brief
                                                                                                       

   In other action, the high court:
   -- Refused, by a 5-4 vote, to lift a state court judge's
injunction against protests at abortion clinics in Atlanta.
The injunction was issued against Operation Rescue, which has
led anti-abortion demonstrations at clinics throughout the
country. But protesters had asked the Supreme Court for a
stay while they appeal, arguing that the order infringes on
their free-speech rights.
   Justices Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony Kennedy dissented, saying they would grant the stay
while the group appeals. (Hirsh vs. City of Atlanta)
   -- By a 6-3 vote, ruled that federal labor law pre-empts a
lawsuit for damages filed in state court charging the United
Steelworkers of America with negligence in a 1972 accident at
an Idaho silver mine in which 91 miners were killed. The
lawsuit was filed by families of the miners, charging that
the union was negligent because it had a representative on
the mine safety committee. But in an opinion written by
Justice White, the high court said the complaint falls under
the collective bargaining agreement. Justice Kennedy
dissented, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justice Scalia. (Steelworkers vs. Rawson)
