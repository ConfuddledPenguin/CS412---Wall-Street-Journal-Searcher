   DALLAS -- Tyler Corp. said it completed the sale of its
Atlas Powder Co. unit in a stock transaction valued at about
$127.8 million with Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, London.
   Tyler, once a Fortune 500 holding company with four
diverse operating units, now has one remaining subsidiary.
Under the transaction, Tyler shareholders will receive one
share of a new Tyler Corp. representing Tyler Pipe Industries
and the parent company's assets and liabilities, for each old
Tyler share owned.

   Shareholders will swap their old Tyler shares,
representing Atlas Powder and $64.5 million in old Tyler bank
debt, for stock in Imperial Chemical. Tyler holders can opt
to receive either one Imperial Chemical American depositary
receipt for each 12.7078 Tyler shares owned, or one Imperial
common share for each 3.1769 Tyler shares owned. Each
Imperial ADR represents four Imperial common shares.
   Tyler said that based on the current Imperial ADR value,
Tyler shareholders should receive roughly $6 a share for each
old Tyler share.
   Tyler, which will have 21.3 million shares outstanding
after the transaction, said that an additional 558,413
Imperial shares, valued at $9.9 million, will be held in
reserve pending certain contingencies. The company said they
may be distributed to old Tyler shareholders at a later date.
