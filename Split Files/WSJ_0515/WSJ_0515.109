   Over-the-counter stocks rose to their highest level in two
months as investors shopped among second-tier shares as well
as larger issues, traders said.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.51, or 0.8%, to 441.61,
the highest level since March 19. Advancing stocks outpaced
declining shares, 1,081 to 882, as volume swelled to 177.2
million from 167.6 million on Friday.

   Since Thursday, the Nasdaq index has jumped 8.41, or
1.94%, the largest two-day advance this year. But unlike the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at a new high, the
Nasdaq index is well below its record of 485.73 last Oct. 9.
   "We saw very broad buying interest across the whole
board," said E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine,
Geduld Inc., a wholesale New York market maker. While Mr.
Geduld said most of his clients bought larger stocks, some
regional shares were in vogue at Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in
Memphis, said Hedy Reynolds, head of OTC trading there.
   Interest in second-tier and regional stocks picked up at
the end of last week and continued yesterday, Ms. Reynolds
said. Among some active southeastern regional stocks were:
SCI Systems, a Huntsville, Ala., maker of electronics
equipment, up 1/2 at 11 1/8, and Ryan's Family Steak House, a
Greer, S.C., restaurant chain, up 1/4 at 8 1/4. First
American (Tennessee) rebounded 1/2 to 12 3/4 from last week's
tumble after eliminating its dividend and reporting a
second-quarter loss.
   Led by MCI Communications, up 1 3/8 to 40 1/2, the Nasdaq
utility index jumped 10.56, or 1.76%, to 623.66. PaineWebber
telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman said in an interview
that regional and long-distance telephone companies rebounded
after being pressured earlier in the year amid fears of a
price war.
   Mr. Grubman also suggested that investors might be buying
telephone shares in advance of Thursday's expected rate
filing by the nation's largest telephone company, AT&amp;T. The
analyst said it's widely anticipated that for the first time
since the break-up of the Bell system, AT&amp;T will ask the
Federal Communications Commission to approve unchanged or
even higher rates, because of inflation and other factors. If
so, such a move would lead to firmer rates across the
industry, he noted.
   MCI also got a boost from money manager Emmanuel Gerard of
Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co., who recommended the stock in
this week's edition of Barron's.
   Shares of cellular telephone stocks also were strong after
this newspaper reported that cellular operators are counting
on the development of digital technology to continue their
rapid growth. McCaw Cellular Communications Class A shares
rose 5/8 to 26 7/8; LIN Broadcasting class B shares advanced
2 to 68; Contel Cellular Class A shares gained 1 3/4 to 17
3/4, and U S West NewVector Class A shares added 1 to close
at 33 1/4.
   Cellular Communications rose 3/4 to 32 3/4 after reporting
net income for the first quarter ended March 31 of $1.08 a
share, after a gain, compared with a loss of nine cents a
share a year earlier.
   Sun Microsystems, up 1 1/8 at 30 1/2, led the technology
issues. The Mountain View, Calif., computer manufacturer
announced that General Electric selected Sun's UNIX-based
workstations. Other active technology issues included Seagate
Technology, up 7/8 at 14, and Oracle Systems, up 5/8 at 18
5/8. On the other hand, Apple Computer slid 7/8 to 41 3/4 and
Intel fell 1/2 to 44 1/2. The Nasdaq 100 Index of larger
issues, including large technology shares, jumped 5.94, or
1.34%, to 447.72.
   Hometown Bancorp was among the day's biggest percentage
gainers, up 3/4 at 3 3/4. The Darien, Conn., parent company
of the Bank of Darien, said it will buy back up to 500,000
shares of its stock in a Dutch auction; in this kind of
auction, the price paid will be the lowest at which the
desired number of shares are offered. The bank also reported
a loss for the first quarter ended March 31 of $1.13 a share,
after a provision for loan losses, compared with net income
of eight cents a share a year earlier.
   Telematics International gained 1/2 to 3 1/4 after the Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., maker of computer networking equipment
reported a loss of seven cents a share for the first quarter
ended March 31, narrowed from a loss of 27 cents a share a
year earlier.
   Sproutz-Reitz Stores leaped 3 3/8 to 13 1/2 after the
Portland, Ore., concern said Friday it received an
unsolicited $17-a-share buy-out proposal from an investor
group.
   LTX gained 1/8 to 3 1/8 after the Westwood, Mass., maker
of test equipment for integrated circuits said Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. of Japan agreed to invest $12 million in LTX
common shares and convertible debentures and an additional
$12 million in an LTX-Sumitomo Metal joint venture.
   Action Auto Rental advanced 1 to 6 3/4. Robert Moore,
chief financial officer of the Solon, Ohio, automobile
insurer, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the rise
might be tied to recent recommendations of the stock by
analysts at Smith Barney, Upham &amp; Harris and McDonald &amp; Co.
   Addington Resources tumbled 2 3/4 to 16 3/4. The Ashland,
Ky., coal mining company said it expects to report
first-quarter earnings either today or tomorrow, but declined
to elaborate.
   Artel Communications fell 1 1/8 to 4 7/8. Late Friday, the
company said it doesn't expect to report a profit for the
fiscal second quarter and that revenue in the quarter will be
"significantly" lower than previously expected. For the
second quarter ended July 1, 1989, Artel reported net income
of seven cents a share.
