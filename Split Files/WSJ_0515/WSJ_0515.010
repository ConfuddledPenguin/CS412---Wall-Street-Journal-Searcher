   The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court gave no indication
that they view a new federal flag-burning law more favorably
than a similar Texas law they struck down in June by a 5-4
vote.
   Five of the nine justices posed questions during an
hourlong argument in which Solicitor General Kenneth Starr
defended the law and civil-liberties lawyer William Kunstler
argued that it is unconstitutional.

   "Nothing prohibits a legislature from providing physical
protection to symbols," said Mr. Starr. "One can protect
those things that are special to us as a people." He added,
"Congress was seeking in a neutral way, without regard to the
message, to protect the integrity of the flag."
   But Mr. Kunstler, noting that Congress allowed the flag to
be flown in a "hurricane, thunderstorm or tornado," said the
federal law "protects {the flag} only from those who would
hurt it or cast it in a bad light." That, he said, means
Congress intended to penalize only those who are protesters
-- which is unconstitutional.
   The federal law was passed last summer in response to the
June decision. Immediately after the law took effect in
October, protesters burning the flag were arrested in Seattle
and Washington, D.C. In both cases, federal district judges
declared the law unconstitutional.
   In its decision in June, the court said the Texas law
infringed on the free-speech right because it penalized
burning the flag as a form of political protest that offended
others. Congress tried to circumvent this problem by
eliminating subjective judgment, making it illegal to damage
the flag in any manner.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who voted against the Texas law,
appeared unpersuaded. He said taking out the words "cast
contempt" from the old federal law doesn't solve the problem,
noting that the terms in the new law -- "deface, defile,
trample" -- have the same negative connotation.
   Mr. Starr argued that the two episodes weren't
constitutionally protected because the protesters had a broad
range of verbal, political messages that weren't related to
burning the American flag.
   Justice Scalia responded, "Surely burning the flag conveys
something." Justice John Stevens interjected, "Given Justice
Scalia's interpretation, maybe you should try to bar
{flag-burning} on the grounds that it's misleading."
   Justice Stevens, who voted to uphold the Texas law, asked
Mr. Kunstler, "Is it irrelevant that I don't know which is
the message" of the protest. Mr. Kunstler said the act of
flag-burning still conveys a message. Justice Stevens replied
caustically that protesters could hand out a leaflet saying,
"Just call this phone number and I'll tell you what the
message is."
   The stakes are high in this case because if the court
strikes down the law this spring, there will be substantial
political pressure in Congress to approve a constitutional
amendment protecting the flag. Members of Congress, in turn,
would face the amendment as a fall election issue.

   "THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES" raises legal ruckus in New
Jersey.
   Robert Wilentz, New Jersey's chief justice, refused to
allow a production crew to film a scene in an Essex County
courthouse in Newark unless script changes were made.
   Judge Wilentz last week barred the use of a courtroom to
film a scene that shows a group of black citizens rioting
because, he said, it "could serve to seriously undermine the
confidence of black citizens in our court system."
   Warner Bros., which is producing the film based on the
novel by Tom Wolfe, has sought permission to film a different
scene in the corridor outside the courtroom. In a written
statement issued Sunday, Justice Wilentz said he would only
approve the corridor filming if the scene was changed to make
it less objectionable.
   Warner had agreed to donate $250,000 to the courthouse
restoration fund for the use of the courtroom. In order to
shoot in the corridor, the company would pay the standard
location fee, an average of $1,700 for a twelve-hour film
day.
   "We would hope that Judge Wilentz would recognize the
First Amendment rights of this picture, based on a work of
fiction, to be made as our filmmakers have envisioned. We
have no intention of rewriting the scene," said Rob Harris,
the film's production publicist, on behalf of Warner Bros., a
Time Warner Inc. unit.
   The filming of the best-selling novel about an investment
banker's journey through the New York court system has
generated controversy. Residents and officials of the Bronx,
N.Y., where substantial action takes place, have charged that
the film denigrates the borough.
   Mr. Harris said the crew considered filming the courtroom
scene in the Bronx courthouse but decided it would be too
difficult to move the equipment up and down to the
sixth-floor courtroom. Ultimately the scene was filmed in a
courtroom on the second floor of the courthouse in Queens, a
New York City borough.
   Nicholas Amato, Essex County executive, said the county
may file a lawsuit opposing the judge's decision and possibly
seeking monetary damages for the lost fee. Mr. Amato said the
judge had no authority to act as a censor, particularly since
the courthouse is maintained with taxpayers' money.
   Mr. Amato said he had been unhappy with the portrayal of
Italian-Americans as "gangsters, dope dealers and
blackmailers" in the movie "Rage of Angels," which was also
filmed at the courthouse. "But my remedy is the same as
others, don't go to see the movie," he said.

   TAX EXEMPTION for Bible sales is invalidated in North
Carolina.
   The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
struck down a 50-year-old North Carolina state law that
exempted the sale of Holy Bibles from the state's 5% sales
tax. The decision reaffirmed a line of cases by the U.S.
Supreme Court that rejected tax exemptions for religious
literature as violative of the First Amendment.
   North Carolina's law specifically exempted Bibles which
combine in one volume the Old and the New Testament. The
appeals court said the law violated constitutional
prohibitions against government establishment of religion and
against infringements on freedom of the press. "It is
precisely this type of official scrutiny of the content of
publications . . . that is so repugnant to the free press
clause of the Constitution," wrote Chief Circuit Judge Sam J.
Ervin III.
   The case was argued by Brian L. Rubin, a Washington, D.C.,
lawyer at the firm of Sidley &amp; Austin, who noticed the tax
when he bought an Old Testament Bible -- which wasn't
exempted from the tax because it didn't include the New
Testament. He brought the case on behalf of a rabbi, a member
of the Hindu faith and a member of the Hare Krishna.
   Assistant North Carolina Attorney General Donald W. Laton
said his office only challenged the plaintiffs' legal
standing to bring the suit and didn't defend the validity of
the law. Said Mr. Laton, "We do not foresee further appeal at
this time."

   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT backs antitrust lawsuit against big
insurers.
   State attorneys general who banded together to sue some of
the country's biggest insurance companies over an alleged
antitrust conspiracy got a boost when the Justice Department
urged a federal court to allow pretrial proceedings to
continue.
   The department last week filed a friend-of-the court
brief, urging the federal circuit court in San Francisco to
reverse a trial judge's earlier decision to dismiss the
lawsuit brought by attorneys general from 19 states. The
appeal also got a boost from 13 other states, which filed a
similar brief. A court may consider such an amicus brief by a
nonparticipant in a case, but an outside party's argument
doesn't necessarily affect the outcome.
   In their suit, the state prosecutors charged that major
U.S. insurers conspired to eliminate certain lines of
commercial liability and property coverage. Last year, a
federal trial judge dismissed the case, concluding that the
defendants' conduct was immune from prosecution under
exceptions to the federal antitrust laws protecting certain
joint activities by insurance companies. The Justice
Department, in its brief, contended that the suit should be
allowed to proceed because the state attorneys general
alleged boycotts, coercion and intimidation not covered by
the insurance-industry exceptions.
   Justice Department support for the states merits attention
because federal antitrust regulators in recent years have
scolded state prosecutors for attempts to enforce federal
antitrust laws.

   PRO BONO LEGAL WORK is required at four law schools.
   At Tulane University Law School in New Orleans, the first
law school to implement a public-service requirement, each of
this year's graduates completed at least 20 hours of free
legal service for indigents. Supervised by local lawyers, the
students assisted clients with a variety of legal needs,
including bankruptcy proceedings, landlord-tenant problems,
death-penalty appeals and child-abuse cases.
   Law schools at Florida State University, Valparaiso
(Indiana) University and the University of Pennsylvania
approved compulsory public service for their students, and
more than 20 other law schools are considering similar
programs.
   Some of the schools plan to let students fulfill pro bono
requirements through work for public-service organizations.
Students at the University of Pennsylvania can work for any
government employer and for non-profit groups other than
trade associations. "We don't discriminate on the basis of
political orientation," says Judith Bernstein-Baker, director
of the law school's public-service program.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Washington Legal
Foundation, environmental groups, and organizations on both
sides of the abortion issue have solicited the pro bono
services of the University of Pennsylvania students.
