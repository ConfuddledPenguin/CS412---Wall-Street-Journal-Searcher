   A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder that is
trying to oust the board of Pic `N' Save Corp. said a large
shareholder agreed to support the partnership's slate.
   Bill M. Thomas, who owns about 1.4 million Pic `N' Save
shares, or 4% of the 35.4 million shares outstanding, also
has agreed to be one of the nominees of Girard Partners L.P.,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Girard holds 6.6% of Pic `N' Save.

   Mr. Thomas, who is in his mid-50s, was the company's
executive vice president and chief financial officer for
about eight years until April 1987. The partnership has
nominated four other men to the company's seven-member board.
   A spokesman for the Dominguez, Calif.-based discount
retailer declined to comment.
   Girard has been soliciting consents from holders in
support of its slate and has said it is seeking access to the
company's nonpublic financial information to make a bid to
acquire the company. Girard also has threatened a proxy
contest at the June 20 annual meeting.
