producer input prices, or prices of raw materials and fuels
purchased by manufacturing industry, fell an unadjusted 0.3%,
Britain's Central Statistical Office reported.
   The statistical office also said output prices in April
were up 6.1% from a year earlier, the highest year-to-year
rise since a jump of 6.3% in December 1982.
