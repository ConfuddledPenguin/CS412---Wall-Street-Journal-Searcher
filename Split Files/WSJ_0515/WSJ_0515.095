   THE WORK ETHIC is dead, engineers complain. Bosses are
faulted, too.
   In a scathing indictment of both workers and managers,
three of four engineers surveyed by the Institute of
Industrial Engineers agree "the loss of a strong work ethic
in this country contributes to low productivity." By wide
margins, they believe employees don't work as hard or as
well, or are as loyal or motivated as 10 years ago. Workers,
moreover, are ill-educated, unenthusiastic and resistant to
change.

   Companies are bashed for ignoring the problem. "Management
lacks the commitment to implement productivity programs for
employees," three-quarters of the engineers say. And fully
91% of them state "companies are more interested in
short-term financial gain than in long-term investment in
productivity and quality." Workers aren't consulted before
decisions are made, say the engineers.
   Productivity will increase if pay is linked to performance
and profit, the engineers believe.
                                                                                                       

   BALONEY, retort companies and unions. Workers are better,
they say.
   "I totally disagree with all the statements made,"
declares George Graham, a senior vice president of Texas
Instruments Inc. Education remains a "major concern for all
of us," but motivation, dedication and enthusiasm are "on a
significant upswing," he asserts. Robert McClure, president
of Tandy Corp.'s Tandy Electronics subsidiary, says "the
American worker has come a long way." Today's employees are
"working smarter," Johnson Controls Inc. concurs.
   Chrysler Corp.'s advertising trumpets its belief that
American workmanship has improved, a point seconded by the
United Auto Workers. "All the solid work done in this area
contradicts the opinions presented in this survey," the union
says. And Richard Van Bell, Deere &amp; Co.'s personnel director,
asserts American management is committed to quality.
Managers, he says, are "getting better and better" at
listening to what workers can contribute. Many agree with
Larry Brady, executive vice president of FMC Corp., that pay
for performance does, indeed, motivate.
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIVE SPENDING: Have business jitters closed the
personal checkbook?
   Joel Kovner, chief executive of Professional Bancorp, is
"more frugal" these days. "I have the sense that now is the
time to accumulate cash," he says. Besides, he declares,
conspicuous consumption has become "socially unacceptable."
Ted Rybicki, a vice president of Sun Banks, hopes Mr. Kovner
is right. "People are too much into this materialism," he
says. "There are a lot more important things in life."
   Henry Coffey, a vice president at J.C. Bradford &amp; Co.,
allows he is spending more, what with a variable-rate
mortgage, the kids and medical bills. "But we're being much
more guarded about it. That comes from being extremely
nervous. I'm in the brokerage industry. You fill in the
blanks." But George Zeck, a vice president at Shearson Lehman
Hutton, says his business has been good the past year, so
he's bought a 32-foot sailboat and a place in Florida.
   Me generation free spending hasn't changed "because
there's no reason" for it to change, Mr. Zeck contends.
                                                                                                       

   POOR GRADES: One in four job applicants tested in reading
or math lacks the skills needed for the jobs wanted, an
American Management Association survey finds. One in nine
flunks drug tests.
                                                                                                       

   LOSERS LEAVE. Half the executives who attempt leveraged
buy-outs of their companies don't succeed, and three-quarters
of these failed bidders leave the firms in a year, recruiter
Christian &amp; Timbers says.
                                                                                                       

   PENSION FUNDS hold 26% of the equity and 15% of the
taxable bonds in the U.S. economy, the Employee Benefit
Research Institute estimates. The pot, figured at the close
of 1989, comes to $2.5 trillion.
                                                                                                       

   FORGET ANOTHER "rule of thumb," that the higher your
salary the longer it takes to find a job. Jannotta, Bray &amp;
Associates, an outplacement firm, says posts paying above
$70,000 all take 5 1/2 months.
                                                                                                       

   LIVING BENEFITS are added to worker insurance policies.
But employees pay.
   Mead Corp. considered long-term-care insurance to help
terminally ill workers cope with the massive expenses that
often accompany the end of life. It opted, instead, for the
lower cost -- especially for younger workers -- of a
living-benefit rider to the group universal life coverage
already offered. Such riders customarily allow holders to
collect 50% of their life insurance if they are terminally
ill and face expensive care.
   The coverage -- through Cigna, Mutual of Omaha and
Travelers insurance companies, so far -- isn't cheap.
Employees have to pick up the full tab, and it might cost a
40-year-old man an extra $100 a month. Still, one in five
workers signed up in two months when Mead offered it to
10,000 salaried employees. At Allied-Signal Corp., 42% of the
workers with universal life policies opted for the
living-benefit rider when the coverage was offered to them.
   Unlike life insurance, living benefits are taxable. But a
Senate bill would make them tax exempt.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Corporate vice presidents rank their bosses
high on energy, self-confidence and assertiveness but low as
visionaries or open to ideas, consultant Management Science &amp;
Development finds. . . . Executives surveyed by Robert Half
International think engineers and accountants are the most
ethical professionals. Investment bankers rank dead last.
