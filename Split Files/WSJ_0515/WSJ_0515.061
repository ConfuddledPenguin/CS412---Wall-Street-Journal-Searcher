   NEW YORK -- The central bank of Yugoslavia sued Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. and several Drexel officials, claiming
the bank was duped in a fraudulent scheme that funneled money
to the brokerage firm's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.
   In the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the bank
claimed that because of the scheme it had an investment loss
of $70 million -- more than 1% of Yugoslavia's 1990 federal
budget. The bank said it was the first time it has ever lost
money on an investment transaction.

   The National Bank of Yugoslavia is seeking the return of
its funds and $10 million in punitive damages. It also asked
the court to order that the brokerage firm account for any
gains it made on the assets.
   The central bank is the third largest unsecured creditor
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Corp., which was pushed
into bankruptcy-law proceedings last week alongside the
parent company. The parent filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in February as its liquidity crisis mounted.
In the bankruptcy-law case, Yugoslavia is seeking repayment
of $71.9 million owed by DBL Trading, the company's commodity
trading unit.
   At the time of the parent company's bankruptcy-law filing,
it owed $645 million to DBL Trading. The central bank of
Yugoslavia claims that its investments with Drexel were part
of funds that were "upstreamed" to the cash-starved parent.
   The central bank said that when it turned over its funds
to Drexel in September, it believed they were being invested
conservatively. The bank said that under its investment
requirements, the money should have been invested either with
commercial banks ranking in the top 100 world-wide in terms
of assets or in high-quality debt securities from developed
countries. The central bank said it wouldn't have done
business with Drexel if it had known the money would be
loaned to the parent company. The lawsuit also accused Drexel
of misrepresentation in not disclosing the financial
difficulties the company was facing late last year.
   A Drexel spokesman said the company hasn't received a copy
of the complaint. The parent company has said that it
borrowed funds from DBL Trading and other affiliates as part
of a longstanding policy. The parent company's debt accounts
for almost all of DBL Trading's assets.
   The lawsuit said Drexel officials contacted the bank in
June to offer their services in "central bank reserve
management." The bank hadn't previously done any business
with Drexel.
   After meeting with Drexel officials in Belgrade, central
bank representatives agreed to have Drexel act as the bank's
intermediary in arranging "safe" investments, the suit said.
   The bank made two investments totaling $80 million with
Drexel in September and then rolled the time deposits over in
December at Drexel's request, the suit said. Although further
meetings were held as late as Jan. 10, Drexel officials never
told the central bank that the parent company was worried
about meeting its financial obligations, the suit said.
   On Feb. 13, the day of the parent company's Chapter 11
filing, the lawsuit said the Yugoslav bank received a telex
stating: "We have been trying to reach you urgently. Our
parent company has some liquidity problems which we would
like to explain to you over the telephone." The suit claims
bank officials were told one week later that the money had
been funneled to the parent company and couldn't be returned.
The suit was filed by Kirkland &amp; Ellis, a New York law firm
representing the bank. Richard Levy, a lawyer with the firm,
declined to comment.
