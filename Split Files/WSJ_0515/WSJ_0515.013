   DETROIT -- B. Ralph Sylvia, Detroit Edison Co.'s top
nuclear executive, resigned to run Niagara Mohawk Power Co.'s
troubled nuclear power operations.
   In his four years with Detroit Edison, Mr. Sylvia became
known as a top nuclear trouble-shooter for turning around the
Fermi 2 nuclear plant near Detroit, which had huge cost
overruns, years of delays and frequent regulatory run-ins.
Most recently he was senior vice president, nuclear
generation, at Detroit Edison.

   At Niagara Mohawk, the 49-year-old Mr. Sylvia will again
face a difficult situation. The Syracuse, N.Y., utility is
trying to gain Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval to
restart its Nine Mile Point No. 1 plant, which was shut down
in 1987. Company officials said they met with NRC
commissioners yesterday to set a date for the resumption of
power production at the plant. They said they expect to have
it working again by the end of next month. Meanwhile, Niagara
Mohawk's No. 2 nuclear plant has progressed slowly since its
start-up in mid-1987.
   When he starts at Niagara Mohawk on July 1, Mr. Sylvia
will temporarily serve as senior vice president of nuclear
operations. Later this year, he will become executive vice
president of nuclear operations, succeeding Lawrence
Burkhardt III, a Niagara Mohawk board member and retired Navy
admiral who took the executive vice president's job 1 1/2
years ago on a contract basis.
   Detroit Edison said William S. Orser will succeed Mr.
Sylvia. Mr. Orser, 45, has been vice president, nuclear
operations, since 1987 and was closely involved with the
Fermi 2 plant improvements.
   Mr. Sylvia's departure is the second change involving top
Detroit Edison executives this month. On May 1, John E.
Lobbia was named Detroit Edison's chairman and chief
executive officer in addition to his previous posts of
president and chief operating officer.
   The top-level changes and the loss of a key executive
sparked concern from analysts. "You have to watch very
carefully when a company that has experienced problems loses
some of the management that helped improve the situation,"
said James K. Asselstine, an electric utility credit analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton. "We'll especially watch Detroit
Edison because while Fermi 2 has improved substantially, it
continues to perform below average."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Detroit Edison stock closed at $26.75 a share, down 50 cents.
