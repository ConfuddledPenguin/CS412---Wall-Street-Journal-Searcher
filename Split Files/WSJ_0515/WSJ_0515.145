   Leisure product manufacturer Nintendo Co. reported strong
export sales and a surge in consolidated pretax profit to
67.21 billion yen ($439.7 million) in the seven-month fiscal
period ended March 31.
   A direct comparison to past performance wasn't possible
because of a change in the Tokyo-based company's fiscal year.
Consolidated pretax profit was 69.458 billion yen in fiscal
1988, which ended last Aug. 31.
