   The Institute for Independent Education recently examined
the test scores and enrollment patterns of the
elementary-school students in several urban areas. We found
that 74 percent of the African-American students in Detroit,
Indianapolis, Rochester, New Orleans, Baltimore, and Prince
George's County, Maryland, attend schools at which the median
percentile rank is below the national norm in reading,
mathematics, or both.
   Five years ago I was intrigued to discover that so many
independent elementary and secondary schools had been created
by African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians,
and Asian-Americans, and I was heartened to discover that
they stood as beacons of hope in the devastated landscapes of
so many inner-city communities. In many cases those schools
had restored the faith of families disillusioned by the
failure of inner-city public schools to educate their
children. Over one-third of the schools found so far are in
the Northeast. Over 87 percent of the families served are
African-American.
   The African-American schools in the private sector have
been developed by educators who have high expectations for
urban youth -- and who, consciously or unconsciously, have
begun to move Africa back to the center of their educational
theory and practice. Some have been more successful than
others in that regard, but all have created environments that
nurture children.
   . . . education for African-Americans could be improved
significantly if independent neighborhood schools gradually
replaced most, if not all, of the inner-city public schools.
Independent schools embody the right to choose and are viable
options for many low-income families. Parents choose them not
only because of what they teach and how they teach it but
because they are safe havens from the violence and chaos that
affect so much of inner-city life.
