   NEW YORK -- The stock market rallied to a record high on
the Dow Jones Industrial Average as encouraging prospects for
interest rates and inflation continued to push investors off
the sidelines.
   Prices closed well below the day's best levels, however,
as profit-taking surfaced in the afternoon amid speculation
that the market had overdone its advance.

   "There's a lot of people that are still saying, `We've got
to correct. We've gone too far too fast,'" said Dale Tills,
manager of institutional equities trading at Charles Schwab &amp;
Co., San Francisco.
   The industrial average gave back most of its gains but
managed to finish 19.95 higher at 2821.53 -- above the
previous record of 2810.15, established Jan. 2.
   After surging 63.07 points Friday, the Dow industrial
average tacked on an additional 52 points through midday as a
result of continued buying interest from institutional
investors seeking to offset short positions, and some
occasional bursts of futures-related program buying.
   In the process, the average surpassed its best-ever
intraday reading with ease. On Jan. 3, the 30-stock measure
had peaked at 2834.04; in the latest session, it exceeded
that mark by nearly 20 points.
   Broader market indexes, hampered by their relatively weak
performance in comparison to the Dow industrial average over
the past few months, didn't come close to setting record
highs of their own.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index closed 1.4% below its
all-time high of 359.80, set last Oct. 9. Also, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index finished 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively, below the
all-time high set on the same day.
   In the latest session, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.75 to 354.75,
while the composite index added 1.41 to 193.65, and the Dow
equity index went up 2.68 to 329.74. Advancing issues led
decliners by 1,062 to 555 on the Big Board.
   Market activity remained brisk with 225,410,000 shares
changing hands. The volume was the second highest this year
on the Big Board, outranked only by Friday's total of
234,040,000.
   Among technical analysts, who focus on market statistics
in assessing the outlook for stock prices, the broad market's
relatively weak performance in comparison to the Dow
industrial average has been a source of concern for some
time.
   But some technicians said the situation appears likely to
change for the better in the wake of Friday's surge, in which
the number of shares traded above their previous close on the
Big Board topped the volume of decliners by a margin of more
than 19-to-1.
   The ratio of advancing volume to declining volume has
exceeded 9-to-1 only two dozen times in the past 30 years,
according to a study by Richard Eakle, president of Eakle
Associates, a Fair Haven, N.J.-based research firm.
   The study found that stock prices were higher three months
later in 19 of those 24 instances. Six months later, the
market was higher all but once -- in the aftermath of the
October 1987 crash -- and the Dow industrial average showed
an average gain of 17.3%.
   In addition, Mr. Eakle says, measures of the market's
breadth, or the relationship between advancing and declining
stocks, appear to be "inextricably linked to trends in
interest rates." With rates having fallen recently, further
strength in the broad market can be anticipated, he says.
   Ned Davis, a technical analyst based in Venice, Fla., says
the market could be headed for "an upside blow-off," citing
the new high in the Dow industrial average, high levels of
cash and short interest among investors, and indications that
many market players remain pessimistic in spite of the
market's strength.
   If such a blow-off takes place, Mr. Davis says, two
possible targets would emerge for the industrial average --
"just below 3000 if people turn bullish rapidly and everyone
is focused on 3000 as a target," or 3180, representing 30
times his estimate of $106 in 1990 dividend payments for the
30 stocks in the average.
   Du Pont rallied 1 3/4 to 40 3/8 in Big Board composite
trading of 2.6 million shares. Mabon Nugent upgraded its
investment rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral" and
raised its earnings estimates for 1990 and 1991.
   Federal National Mortgage Association, the most active Big
Board issue, dropped 7/8 to 37 7/8 on 4.1 million shares as
selected financial stocks became a target for profit-taking
after setting the pace for Friday's surge. The stock reached
40 5/8 before pulling back in the afternoon.
   Progressive climbed 1 7/8 to 40. The Wall Street Journal
reported in the "Heard on the Street" column that analysts
believe the company will benefit from other insurers'
pullbacks from the auto insurance market.
   International Business Machines rose 1/4 to 114 1/4 on 2.3
million shares, but other major technology issues fared
better with investors. Digital Equipment went up 1 7/8 to 90
1/2, Compaq Computer gained 2 to 112 3/8, and Hewlett-Packard
rose 1 1/4 to 48 3/8 on 1.7 million shares.
   Prime Motor Inns advanced 1 3/4 to 12 1/8 on 1.7 million
shares in the wake of Manor Care's expression of interest in
making a bid for the company's Howard Johnson and Ramada
franchise systems. As previously reported, Prime Motor agreed
in principle to sell a 65% stake in the systems to Blackstone
Capital Partners for about $200 million in cash and notes.
   USX rose 1 to 34 1/4 on 1.9 million shares following a
favorable review of the company in Barron's magazine from
Frederick Leuffer, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell. He said the stock's intrinsic value, based on a
variety of measures, is around $50 a share.
   Atlantic Richfield jumped 2 7/8 to 118 3/4. In a 7-2
ruling, the Supreme Court threw out an antitrust lawsuit
against the company by independent gas stations in California
and Washington state.
   W.R. Grace advanced 3/4 to 28 1/2 after news that
California officials are testing a new kind of catalytic
converter, manufactured by the company's Camet unit.
   Mylan Laboratories went down 1 1/4 to 22 5/8. The company
acknowledged to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that
April sales of Eldepryl, a drug produced by a joint venture
of Mylan and Bolar Pharmaceutical, fell more than 7% from the
March level. Bolar dropped 5/8 to 7 1/2 in American Stock
Exchange trading.
   The Amex Market Value Index rose 1.84 to 354.34, its 11th
straight advance, but remained well below the all-time high
of 397.03 set last Oct. 10. Volume totaled 16,170,000 shares
compared with 16,600,000 Friday.
