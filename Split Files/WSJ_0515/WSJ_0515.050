   DALLAS -- Valhi Inc., a holding company controlled by the
investor Harold Simmons, said it completed the purchase of
the 3% of Sybra Inc. that it didn't already own in a stock
swap. Sybra, which is Arby's spelled backwards, is an
Atlanta-based Arby's fast-food franchise.
   Valhi said holders of 79,292 Sybra common shares received
1.6 Valhi shares for each Sybra share owned. Holders of
options to buy 87,820 Sybra shares will receive 1.6 Valhi
common shares when those options are exercised, Valhi said.
