   NATICK, Mass. -- DR Holdings Inc. of Delaware, the company
that acquired Prime Computer Inc. in a leveraged buy-out in
August, reported a wider loss on a 4.5% revenue decline for
the first quarter ended April 1.
   The loss, which reflected heavy interest costs and the
sluggish U.S. computer market, widened to $37.2 million, or
69 cents a share, from $5 million, or 10 cents a share, in
the year-ago period when Prime was a public company. DR
Holdings doesn't have any publicly held stock, but the
company has some debt outstanding.

   James McDonald, vice chairman and chief executive officer
of Prime said, "Things are going pretty well. We're pretty
much right on track with what we started off to do."
   Revenue for the quarter declined to $369.8 million from
$387 million, despite an increase in service revenue. Prime
said that international demand was stronger than expected,
but didn't offset the decline in the U.S. It said that profit
margins suffered because of declines in sales of its highly
profitable proprietary minicomputers. Many makers of
mid-range computers have had similar problems selling in the
U.S. in recent quarters.
   Most of the wider loss was due to higher interest
expenses. DR Holdings said that interest expense in the
latest quarter was $52.4 million compared with $13.5 million
in the year-earlier period. However, net cash interest
payments in the latest quarter amounted to $40 million after
subtracting interest income and paid-in-kind interest.
   DR Holdings said that for the full year it "expects to
generate sufficient cash flows to meet its operating
expenses, capital expenditure requirements, and cash interest
obligations," as well as bank payments. Mr. McDonald, who
said that the cash situation was more important to the
company's creditors than the net income figure, said
cost-cutting programs are continuing to improve its cash
position. He said cash coverage of interest expense rose to
two times from 1.5 times at the end of the previous quarter.
