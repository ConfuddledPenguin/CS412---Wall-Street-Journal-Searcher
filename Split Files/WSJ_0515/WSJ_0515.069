   MASCO Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered
Masco Corp.'s senior debt rating to single-A-3 from
single-A-2 and its subordinated debt rating to Baa-1 from
single-A-3. Moody's said it downgraded Masco's rating because
of high debt levels and modest interest coverage, in part
because of the debt of its Masco Industries affiliate. Also,
Masco has spent about $2 billion on the acquisition and
integration of its home-furnishing operations since 1986,
Moody's said. The rating service said the company's expansion
has kept debt levels high both at Masco Corp. and 49%-owned
Masco Industries. Debt-protection measurements have weakened
because of reduced earnings, Moody's said. Masco's earnings
in the first quarter were $69.8 million, or 45 cents a share,
down 7.4% from $75.4 million, or 48 cents a share, a year
ago. Masco, a Taylor, Mich., maker of building and home
furnishings, declined to comment.
