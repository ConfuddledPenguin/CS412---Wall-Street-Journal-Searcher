   GORBACHEV CALLED the independence bids by Latvia and
Estonia invalid.
   In a pair of presidential decrees read on Soviet
television, the Kremlin leader said the independence
declarations by the two Baltic republics violated the Soviet
constitution and a recent law on secession. He said the
proclamations were null and void from the time of their
adoption. Gorbachev didn't indicate what steps might be taken
to counter the drives. But following Lithuania's March 11
declaration, Moscow reduced supplies of oil and natural gas
in a partial economic blockade that remains in effect.

   Kohl indicated that combined German national elections

   The Supreme Court refused to lift a Georgia judge's
injunction barring an anti-abortion group from blocking
access to abortion clinics in Atlanta. The injunction was
issued against Operation Rescue, which has led demonstrations
at facilities throughout the country. The group argued that
the order infringes on its free-speech rights.
                                                                                                       

   The justices failed to give any indication that they view
a new federal law outlawing flag burning more favorably than
a Texas statute struck down last June. Five of the justices
posed questions during an argument in which the solicitor
general defended the law and a civil-liberties lawyer argued
it is unconstitutional.

   Iranian-backed Hezbollah urged Moslem factions in Lebanon

participated in a walkout to demand wage increases.

U.S. military equipment.
