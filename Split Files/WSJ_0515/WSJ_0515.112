   Swiss Bank Corp., Switzerland's second-largest bank, said
it has a 49% stake in the financial company Unigestion SA of
Geneva with the acquisition of a nonlisted stake of
registered shares.
   Unigestion, in turn, has a 49.9% voting stake, through a
subsidiary, in the medium-sized Swiss bank Banca della
Svizzera Italiana.

   No other details were given, pending a news conference set
for today in Zurich.
   The transaction continues a consolidation in the Swiss
banking industry.
   Analysts suggested that Unigestion had problems in
absorbing the costs of obtaining its indirect controlling
stake in Banca della Svizzera Italiana.
   Analysts speculated that the 49% stake in Unigestion may
give the big Swiss bank enough control to influence
Unigestion's management.
