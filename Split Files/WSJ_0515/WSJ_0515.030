   Five days a week, Jim Lehrer has a very tough job indeed.
As co-anchor of PBS's "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," he must sit
poker-faced while Middle Eastern ambassadors lie about their
nation's plans for all that imported uranium; while
howdy-doody spokesmen for companies whose products kill
people insist that they don't; while lascivious congressmen
with their hearts set on 16-year-old pages rail against the
fulsome lyrics you can hear if you play rock songs backward.
   But on the sixth and seventh days, the eminently likable
Mr. Lehrer rests -- by taking up his pen and venting his
spleen. This is something he does to great effect in his new
novel "The Sooner Spy" (Putnam, 222 pages, $19.95). The book
is the third in a series featuring One-Eyed Mack, the first
acting one-eyed lieutenant governor in the history of
Oklahoma, and a laugh bonanza it is from start to finish.

   This time around, Mack locks horns with a young Choctaw
graduating from Oklahoma Southeastern State College who seeks
a job with the Central Intelligence Agency but feels the
agency is discriminating against him because of his race.
Calvin Howell Youngfoot is certain that if he could only
locate a Russian spy hiding somewhere in the state of
Oklahoma, he could convince the CIA of his worth. Mack agrees
to help, securing the assistance of his best friend, the
one-eared director of the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.
The madcap hunt for the Sooner Spy leads to a Soviet defector
masquerading as a Rotarian manager of a drive-thru
supermarket in semi-rural Oklahoma. He is only given his new
identity by the feds because he knows all the words to the
song "Oklahoma." This leads to a delightful moment when Mack
suggests that the defector be relocated:
   "Why don't you go now and get the guy and get him out of
here? Move him somewhere else in America. He must have a
second favorite Broadway show. What about Iowa? Does he like
`The Music Man?'"
   Whether Mack is talking about his new jacket reading
"acting Governor of Oklahoma" or citing his optical frailty
("We each looked away and then back at each other. My one eye
had both of his locked"), "The Sooner Spy" keeps the gags
coming. A thoroughly impudent assault on politicians,
lobbyists and civic groups everywhere -- but particularly in
Oklahoma -- the book might give guests on Mr. Lehrer's show
pause the next time his face lights up with that cherubic
little smile. Consider this exchange, when the dean of
Oklahoma Southeastern State asks why Mack is so interested in
the Case of the Centrally Intelligent Choctaw:
   "Sorry, Dean. It's Top State of Oklahoma Secret Business."
   "I didn't know there was such a thing."
   The only mystery that remains is: How could a guy who
spends this much time hanging out with Roger Mudd, Norman
Ornstein, Roger Rosenblatt and Nina Totenberg be this funny?
   Two other journalists have recently made forays outside
their chosen field, with less-impressive results. In "Mayday
Man" (Brassey's, 213 pages, $15.95), Pulitzer Prize-winning
political correspondent William Beecher has written an
impossibly convoluted thriller about a group of Egyptian
zealots who devise a plan to drop a nuclear weapon on Moscow
and trick the Russians into thinking Israel is responsible.
Because the tale is set during the reign of Anwar Sadat, we
know that the event could never have taken place, not only
because history tells us so, but because the idea is so dumb.
   Mr. Beecher's prose style doesn't help matters. Although
he does a workmanlike job with the narrative portions of the
tale, the dialogue is Saturday Night at the Hoot Farm. "Do
you take me for an innocent goatherd?" Colonel Qadhafi
demands in one of his disappointingly rare appearances in
contemporary fiction. Mr. Beecher would also have us believe
that a U.S. senator hiring a journalist as a policy planner
at the Pentagon would bark: "I want some creative,
unconventional thinking in this musty old fudge factory." Oh,
yeah, I can just hear Bob Dole and Sam Nunn now: "Can the
piffle and stow the malarkey. Let's get down to brass tacks
here in this musty old fudge factory]" What do you take us
for, Mr. Beecher, innocent goatherds?
   Speaking of fudge factories, how about John Chancellor's
"Peril and Promise: A Commentary on America" (Harper &amp; Row,
171 pages, $17.95). Yes, there comes a time in every retired
news reader's life when he wants to be accorded the status of
philosopher-king, like Socrates or Montesquieu or Bill
Moyers. With that end in mind, the former NBC anchorman, who
now provides something called "commentary" for the network,
has compiled a dreary, predictable list of everything that
has gone wrong in the U.S. in the past 30 years, followed by
his dreary, predictable prescriptions for turning things
around.
   Mr. Chancellor does have the good grace to include a
"sources" section, the honorable thing to do when you've
written a volume that doesn't contain a single original
thought. Moreover, most of the thoughts that he's borrowed
are pretty jaded, including, for instance, a value-added
national sales tax, always a favorite with the
expense-account set. The book reads like a very long
commencement speech given at a very small university where
the speaker receives a very cheap-looking plaque for a job
not very well done. Gee, isn't Oklahoma Southeastern looking
for a guest speaker this June?
