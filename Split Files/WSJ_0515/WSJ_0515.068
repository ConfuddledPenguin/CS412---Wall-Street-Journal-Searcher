   Of all the tests facing Mikhail Gorbachev these days, one
of the toughest comes from -- Glendale, Calif. Glendale is
the home of Paruyr Hayrikyan, an upstart Armenian whom the
Soviets thought they got rid of when they stripped him of
citizenship and dumped him in Ethiopia in 1988. Now this
exiled democrat is a registered candidate for election to the
Armenian Supreme Soviet. Armenia has not yet reached the
point of declaring independence like Lithuania. But voters
who hope this Sunday's election will bring change are
marching through the streets shouting "Hayrikyan,
Independence."
   Over lunch at The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr.
Hayrikyan outlined a future for Armenia. "We need political
independence first, and then economic independence -- the
head must come before the stomach." He worries about
independence movements throughout the Soviet Union. "After
Lithuania, we are sure: The Western governments are with the
communists and the democratic movements are alone."

   The answer, he believes, is for independence movements to
join hands. In Paris last year, he helped to found Democracy
and Independence, an umbrella group that pulled together
exiled leaders of prodemocracy movements from many republics
of the Soviet Union. Democracy and Independence operates out
of an office in Glendale whose answering machine talks to
callers in English and Armenian.
   News of strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis has
overshadowed reports of democratic heroism from Mr.
Hayrikyan's part of the world. Mr. Hayrikyan takes the
classic Armenian stance: He believes the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh "was taken" from Armenians by Moscow and
given to Azerbaijanis.
   But Mr. Hayrikyan argues that much of the inter-ethnic
strife has been fomented by Moscow to obscure the
independence struggle. During the past six months, Moscow has
opened its armories of tanks and guns to rebels from both
sides to escalate the conflict. In January, Moscow "closed
her eyes" during six days of killing in which more than 100
died. For now, he says, Azerbaijanis and Armenians have
little hope of resolving their difficulties on home
territory. But he hopes international meetings -- such as one
set up by Czech President Vaclav Havel for July 4 in Prague
-- will ease the violence.
   Hope is something in which Mr. Hayrikyan has a fair amount
of practice. "I was very young" he says, recalling his first
arrest in 1969. He was arrested for his activities as leader
of what was then Armenia's only noncommunist party, the
National United Party. "But I was a real anti-communist." He
spent the following four years in prison -- much of them in
solitary confinement in a small cell. In 1974, he was
arrested again, and didn't go free until 1988. Of the 41
years of his life, 17 have been spent in some form of prison.
   Time behind bars was, for Mr. Hayrikyan, time to think
about what kind of freedom Armenia needed. "I asked, `What is
the revolutionary way and what is the peaceful way?'" In
prison he learned a new term that seemed to him like the
peaceful solution: referendum. "When I talked about
`referendum' after I got out of prison, people didn't know
what I meant. I had to explain -- referendum is the action of
democracy." He also used the prison time to study
independence movements outside Armenia, and learned Latvian
well enough to do some Latvian-Armenian translation.
   It was another talent that made Mr. Hayrikyan a national
symbol: songwriting. His last words to the Soviet court after
one prison sentence were: "You may kill me, but after my
death you have to fight against my songs." His words held
true. Armenians sing his lyrics: "We are in prison, we are in
exile, but, Fatherland, you will be free."
   In the end the Soviets resorted to deporting their gadfly.
But even this plan went wrong at first: Foreign governments
refused to accept Mr. Hayrikyan unless he came willingly, and
Mr. Hayrikyan preferred prison at home to exile.
   Finally the Soviets found a country that did not seem
fussy about whether Mr. Hayrikyan wanted to emigrate or not:
Ethiopia. With seven KGB men and a doctor to babysit him, the
Armenian was put on a nine-hour flight from Moscow to Addis
Ababa. There Mr. Hayrikyan found asylum with the U.S.
Embassy. Later, in Paris, he returned a pair of shoes the KGB
had given him. "`These are for the Soviets' revolutionary
museum,' I said. Shoes of the last person forcibly exiled
from the Soviet Union."
   Oddly enough, this kind of heroism has not always sat well
with the large Armenian community in Glendale. Historically,
many Armenians have seen Moscow as the Armenians' protector
against Turkey, the nation that killed so many Armenians
seven decades ago. Even today, many California Armenians
support a tolerant attitude toward Mr. Gorbachev. When, in an
interview with a Turkish paper, Mr. Hayrikyan said Turks and
Armenians should forget old differences, they got angry. But
Armenians closer to Moscow -- Armenians in Soviet Armenia --
"want my return" says Mr. Hayrikyan.
   For now, Mr. Hayrikyan's name is on the ballot. Whether
Armenians will get more than this contact with one of their
own nation's candidates depends on Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr.
Hayrikyan, for one, is optimistic. "Several years ago,
Gorbachev was saying that the Soviet Union didn't need a
multiparty system. Now he's saying different things."
   "Every change," he says, "is good for Armenia."
