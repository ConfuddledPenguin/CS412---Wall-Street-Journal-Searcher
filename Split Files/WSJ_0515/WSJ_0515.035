   As the cost of bailing out the battered savings and loan
industry continues to escalate, one group has suggested
letting the whole thing go to pot.
   A California group called Business Alliance for Commerce
in Hemp (BACH) says the plant, the leaves of which make
marijuana, could "save" troubled thrifts.

   In a release titled "Hemp and the Economy," the
organization says "the savings and loan industry could recoup
its losses . . . by allowing debtors to invest in hemp."
   "Marijuana income for 1988 was $41.6 billion," the group
claims, adding that "money generated by sales of relaxational
hemp alone could pay off" a sizable portion of the bailout.
"Estimates of the total legitimate revenues that would be
generated by legal commerce in nonsmoking hemp range from 10
to 100 times that amount." The low end of that range would
just about do the trick: The government now estimates the S&amp;L
bailout will cost between $400 billion and $500 billion.
   Nonrelaxational uses for hemp are numerous, the group
says. It can be made into fuel or cooking oil ("So long OPEC
and oil shortages]") or into clothing (fabrics made from hemp
hold "shape as well as polyester" and can be woven as "smooth
as silk or intricate as lace"). Dale Gieringer, coordinator
for California's branch of the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, says hemp shorts and shirts
imported from China are "one of our best sellers."
   BACH appeals to nationalist feelings, asserting that the
Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were
probably both originally drafted on paper made from hemp. And
"hemp could save the family farm in America. But special
interest groups have kept it out of the reach of our
patriotic and hard working farmers."
   Not out of the hands of all farmers, of course. "Although
illegal, cannabis is already the largest cash crop in several
states, including California," the group says. A spokeswoman
for the state's multi-agency Campaign Against Marijuana
Planting effort concurs.
   Still, the prospect of turning to hemp to help thrifts
remains hazy, according to federal regulators. "I see
political problems" with using marijuana to support failed
S&amp;Ls, says a spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in Washington. "My alternative is to make it available
to taxpayers to ease the trauma of paying for the S&amp;L
bailout."
