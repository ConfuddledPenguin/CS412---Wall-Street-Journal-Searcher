   Greyhound Lines Inc. said it will operate charter fleets
in 19 focus markets for the remainder of 1990. The unit of
Dallas-based GLI Holding Inc. had charter sales offices in 34
cities prior to the continuing strike by 9,400 employees
represented by the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Frank Schmieder, president and chief operating officer,
said the company selected the 19 metropolitan markets to
launch its revamped charter operation "because of their
strong year-round charter business."

   Each location will have a dedicated fleet of buses
reserved for charter customers. In the past, charter buses
were drawn from the intercity passenger fleet. The new system
will result in improved maintenance of charter coaches, the
company said.
   The restructuring of charter operations marks another
attempt by the debt-burdened bus company to rebuild revenues
that have been battered by the ATU strike that began March 2.
The company announced last week that it was holding talks
with lenders, creditors and suppliers in hopes of
restructuring its lending agreements and debt payments.
   No new negotiations have been scheduled with the striking
union.
