   ST. LOUIS -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing the
deteriorating outlook for defense contractors, lowered its
ratings on about $3.4 billion of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s
senior and subordinated debt.
   Moody's downgraded McDonnell Douglas's senior debt and
shelf registration to Baa-1 from single-A-3, and subordinated
debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1.

   The rating concern said its action also was based on
McDonnell Douglas's "continuing operating difficulties at its
commercial aircraft operations."
   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the company was
notified by Moody's several weeks ago that it might downgrade
the debt. "Everybody knows we're experiencing financial
difficulties, particularly in our transport-aircraft
business, where we had an operating loss of $84 million in
the first quarter," the spokesman said. "But that's also an
area where we think there's tremendous potential."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $47.875, down $1.
