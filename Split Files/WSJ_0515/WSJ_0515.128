   NEW YORK -- Fixed-income portfolio managers, worried about
missing the strongest bond market rally this year, went on a
buying spree.
   The buying pushed bond prices moderately higher. The
Treasury's new benchmark 30-year bond, which climbed more
than two points on Friday, rose 5/8 point yesterday for a
gain of $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.

   Analysts said many of the buyers were institutional
investors who had been waiting until the Treasury's huge
$30.5 billion refunding auction was complete before venturing
into the market.
   These investors believed that a poorly received auction
would force bond dealers to cut prices, so they decided to
wait until after the auction to buy bonds. However, last
week's note and bond auction was considered a success.
Moreover, bond prices rose sharply on Friday after two
economic reports reinforced the view that interest rates are
heading lower.
   "There has been an extraordinary change in psychology,"
said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., managing director at Stone &amp;
McCarthy Research Associates Inc. "Investors who were
reluctant to buy bonds ahead of the auction {now} feel uneasy
about having missed something."
   Meanwhile, the focus of the bond market has shifted to
Washington, where Congress and the White House begin
negotiations today on a compromise to shrink the swelling
budget deficit. In March, the latest month for which Treasury
data are available, the deficit widened to a monthly record
of $53.3 billion.
   Traders said deficit-reduction talks have contributed to
the market's positive tone. Although many market players are
somewhat skeptical that the talks will lead to a concrete
deficit-cutting accord, they are more hopeful than they have
been in the past.
   "I think this is another ritual dance," said Victor Chang,
president of V.C. Management Co., an investment advisory
firm. "However, I do think conditions have deteriorated
enough that something positive will come out of it."
   He said the bond market, having lived with prior year
deficits and little significant progress on reducing the
deficits, has "become a little jaded about any really
substantial headway in these matters. But this time, because
of the thrift crisis and because we're so far behind on this
process, everyone has just concluded that something will come
out of it, that something will be done," said Mr. Chang.
   Ian MacKinnon, bond manager at Vanguard Group of
Investment Cos. in Valley Forge, Pa., said he would look
"favorably upon initiatives to raise taxes" as a way to cut
the deficit. He said the move could pave the way for lower
interest rates.
   "It would have a slowing effect on the economy as revenues
are diverted toward cutting the deficit, with beneficial
effects on inflation, as well as reducing" the supply of
Treasury securities used to finance the deficit, said Mr.
MacKinnon.
   Marshall Front, a partner at the investment advisory firm
Stein Roe &amp; Farnham, Chicago, also believes that a
deficit-reduction package could help result in lower interest
rates.
   "Easing inflation, slowing business activity, the budget
summitry all create preconditions for lower long-term and
short-term rates," said Mr. Front. He said long-term U.S.
interest rates may work themselves down to about 8 3/8% to 8
1/2% in the near future.
   The one possible big negative, he said, is if interest
rates "come down too quickly, it could hurt the dollar and
upset the financial markets."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The new benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 101
24/32 to yield 8.58%, up from a price of 101 4/32 to yield
8.63% on Friday. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of
101 22/32 to yield 8.60%, up from 101 14/32 to yield 8.64% on
Friday.
   Short-term interest rates were lower at the Treasury's
weekly bill auction, compared with rates at last week's
auction.
   The government sold $16.86 billion of three-month and
six-month bills. The average rate on the three-month bills
was 7.67%, while the average rate on the six-month bills was
7.68%.
   Those rates were down from last week's auction, when they
were 7.79% and 7.84%, respectively.
   Here are auction details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated May 17. The 13-week bills mature
Aug. 16, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 15.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's recommendation that the Federal National
Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
and other government-sponsored enterprises raise their credit
standings to meet triple-A status, had little impact on the
mortgage-backed securities market.
   These government-sponsored enterprises are the largest
issuers of mortgage securities. Although the recommendation
caused the stock prices of many government corporations to
tumble yesterday, most mortgage securities were unaffected by
the news.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc.
currently rate the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
triple-A. But S&amp;P said that without the support of the
federal government, the agencies would be rated triple-B or
single-A.
   But the Student Loan Marketing Association would have a
top-notch credit rating without its ties to the federal
government, according to S&amp;P. Sallie Mae common stock came
under pressure, ending at 48 3/4, down 1 3/8.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Cheered by gains in the equity market, junk bond investors
bid up high-yield issues, driving prices of most actively
traded bonds more than 1/4 point higher.
   The advance was broad-based and included such well-known
high-yield names as RJR Nabisco Inc., R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
   Although trading volume wasn't exceptionally heavy, junk
bond traders said there was evidence of active buying
interest among a variety of players, including investors who
traditionally buy stocks.
   "A lot of people are trying to buy paper that they think
is dramatically undervalued," said David Feinman, a
high-yield trader at Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co.
   Among the bonds that climbed were RJR's 13.71% convertible
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2009, which chalked up 1
3/8 point to end at 83. The other widely held RJR issue, the
13.71% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, due in 2007,
added 3/4 point to finish at 69 1/2.
   Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in
1998, moved up a point to end at 71 3/4. Trump Taj Mahal's
14% bonds rose 3/4 point to 69 1/2 on the expectation that
the company will make coupon payments due today.
   There were glaring exceptions to yesterday's bullish
market. The junk bonds of Charter Medical Corp. and Southland
Corp. fell on poor earnings reports.
   Charter Medical's 14% senior subordinated debentures lost
another five points to end at 49 in the wake of sharply lower
second-quarter earnings. The bonds, which were trading at 70
in early March, dropped five points Friday after the earnings
report was first released.
   Charter Medical bonds have lost ground ever since the
company reported in mid-March that accounting errors would
result in an increase in its first-quarter loss.
   The junk bonds of Southland, the Dallas-based convenience
store operator, weakened by more than a point on news that
the cash-strapped firm reported a first-quarter operating
loss of $121.5 million, compared with an operating loss of
$113.4 million in the year earlier.
   Among the biggest losers were Southland's 16 3/4%
subordinated debentures that shed more than a point to end at
7.
   In the market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices
ended between 1/4 to 1/2 point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Narrowly underperforming U.S. Treasurys, municipal bonds
were trading as much as 1/2 point higher in late dealings.
   Meanwhile, short-term municipal issues were unchanged,
traders said.
   Despite the lack of supply and thin trading activity,
traders characterized the market's tone as firm ahead of the
next round of economic data today.
   In a light new-issue market, a Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. group
set the preliminary pricing for $70 million of Rhode Island
Housing Mortgage Finance Corp. homeownership opportunity
revenue bonds. This week, more than $1.7 billion in new debt
is scheduled to hit the market.
   In secondary action, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue of 2018 was 3/8 higher at 98 1/4 bid to yield 7.33%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   West German government bonds fell more than 1/2 point in
reaction to Sunday's defeat of the conservative Christian
Democrats in local elections.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats were heavily
beaten by rival Social Democrats in the states of Lower
Saxony and North Rhine-Westfalia, which together contain more
than 40% of the nation's voters.
   West Germany's 7 3/4% bond due 2000 fell 0.53 point to
94.80 to yield 8.55%.
   In Japan, bond prices ended stronger, reflecting a rise in
the value of the yen and a decline in short-term interest
rates. Rates on three-month certificates of deposit fell to
about 7.36%, down from 7.4% on Friday.
   Dealers say that while most of the activity involved
dealers trading on the foreign-exchange action, there was
also investor buying.
   "There was talk that investors have begun to reconstruct
their portfolios," said one dealer.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's
benchmark 10-year bond was quoted at 87.69, up 0.34 point to
yield 7.02%. The price rose further in over-the-counter
trading.
