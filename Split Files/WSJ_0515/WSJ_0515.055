   BRANCHBURG, N.J. -- Air &amp; Water Technologies Corp., an
environmental services concern, said Cie. Generale des Eaux
of France agreed to purchase $100 million of Air &amp; Water's
Class A common stock in a private placement outside the U.S.
   Sale of the stock to Generale des Eaux, a group of water,
power, heating and maintenance companies based in Paris,
would be made concurrently with the completion of a
contemplated public offering by Air &amp; Water. The
private-placement agreement provides that the purchase price
per share will be equal to 108.33% of the share price in Air
&amp; Water's public offering.

   Either party may terminate the agreement if Air &amp; Water
doesn't receive by June 4 proceeds of at least $130 million
from the sale of securities in the public offering, including
the sale of at least two million Air &amp; Water Class A common
shares.
   The agreement will allow Air &amp; Water access to markets of
Generale des Eaux in Europe and the Far East, and, in turn,
let Air &amp; Water work with the big French service concern in
the U.S. for products and services that don't compete.
   Air &amp; Water has 16 million common shares outstanding,
excluding the planned private placement and the public
offering. The number of shares to be issued would depend on
the selling price, which hasn't been determined.
   After the announcement of the private equity purchase,
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it raised its ratings on Air &amp;
Water's $150 million of convertible subordinated debentures,
due 2015, currently being marketed, to single-B-plus from
single-B; senior debt to double-B from double-B-minus; and
subordinated debt to single-B-plus from single-B, affecting
$250 million of debt. Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
raised its ratings on Air &amp; Water's senior debt to Ba-2 from
Ba-3 and subordinated debt to single-B-1 from single-B-2,
including Air &amp; Water's convertible subordinated debentures.
   Air &amp; Water Class A shares closed at $25.75, up $1.25, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
