   OTTAWA -- Canada's unemployment rate declined to a
seasonally adjusted 7.2% of the work force in March, its
lowest level since August 1981, Statistics Canada said.
   The February rate was 7.7%.

   The unemployment decline was attributed to a drop of
91,000 in the labor force, the sharpest decrease for any
month since July 1973. An analyst for the federal agency said
Statistics Canada wasn't certain why the labor force declined
so sharply in March.
   Full-time employment fell 47,000 in March while part-time
employment rose 16,000. Manufacturing employment declined
34,000, continuing a downward trend that started in the 1989
second quarter.
