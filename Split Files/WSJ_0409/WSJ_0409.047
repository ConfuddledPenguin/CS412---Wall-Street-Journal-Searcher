   BRUSSELS -- For those moving house across Europe in these
pre-1992 days, here is a cautionary tale. And, be warned,
post-1992 might not be much better.
   Andy Ashton, a 27-year-old marketing manager with a major
Dutch multinational, decided he preferred English sofas to
Dutch ones and opted to import one from the London Sofa Bed
Center. By chance, an old friend from college, Paul Horrell,
was coming to visit Mr. Ashton and had a van at his disposal.
Mr. Ashton's cheapest quote for getting the sofa to Holland
by a moving company had been around 700 guilders ($366); a
friend with a van seemed an attractive alternative.

   Mr. Horrell's problems began at Dover, where he had a T2
freight form filled in by A&amp;G Freight Services (Dover) Ltd.
A&amp;G charged #25 ($40.15) for this initial bout with
bureaucracy; they then informed a bemused Mr. Horrell that he
would have to part with a further #75 for a "European
Community Guarantee." While the T2 described what the goods
were and where they were going, the guarantee is a form of
bond that ensures they get there. Filling out both took at
least an hour.
   Mr. Horrell, complete with sofa, T2 and EC Guarantee, was
then directed down the freight lane to a weighbridge. "Then
came more problems," he says. "I was told that my tourist
ticket was completely invalid." Mr. Horrell was reclassified
as freight, which cost him another #80 and another twenty
minutes. Next Mr. Horrell had to go through customs -- he
just made the 10.30 p.m. sailing.
   The French showed little interest in the sofa, but at the
Belgian border yet another form was produced. The officer
wanted five Belgian francs, but settled instead for 20
English pence. At 4 a.m. Mr. Ashton's English sofa approached
the final frontier: the Dutch border.
   Gerlach, a Dutch freight agency, wanted to see the T2, the
EC Guarantee and the VAT invoice from the London Sofa Bed
Center -- the Dutch VAT had already been paid. An hour later
an official returned with an EC Trust Receipt and a customs
clearance document.
   At 7 a.m. Mr. Ashton, who lives in Amsterdam, at last had
his sofa. Understandably, he has few volunteers for his next
furniture shipment.
   Will all this change in 1992? "I think it's not very clear
at the moment," says Gordon Goodacre, director of A&amp;G in
Dover. Though sympathetic, he terms Mr. Horrell's plight "a
one-off incident."
   Querenus Van As, a Dutch customs clearing officer, is
pessimistic. "In theory, yes, things should be easier by
'92," he says. "But nobody believes we'll be ready in two
years. It's not easy to get rid of so much paperwork."
   Mr. Ashton points out that despite the myriad forms that
had to be filled in, and the amount of time spent at borders,
no one ever inspected the sofa. "There are some things you
don't check," says Mr. Van As. "Everybody knows a sofa."
   In Brussels, the European Commission is trying to unravel
customs restrictions, but is facing strong resistance from
national customs authorities, whose bureaucrats are afraid of
losing their jobs and "raison d'etre". "Of course it will be
easier after 1992," a Commission spokesman says. "Everybody
will be able to buy things where they want and take them to
their state of residence." But he has little sympathy for
those contemplating moving objects like sofas themselves.
"It's rather unusual to travel with a sofa."
   In which case is he implying that people should pay the
heavy costs asked by international moving companies? "They're
much quicker," he suggests. Ever helpful, he notes that Mr.
Ashton made more work for himself by paying English VAT on
the sofa. "If you start a process in the wrong way then it's
a mess to emerge from," he says. But a check with the sofa
bed dealer confirms that Mr. Ashton had no choice in paying
English VAT: "Shops of our size have to charge the VAT. It's
only the major department stores that have the means to
deduct VAT."
   Meanwhile Mr. Ashton, anxious to claim his English VAT
back, is surrounded by forms. The Sofa Bed Center is
demanding the Community transit receipt, stamped at both
Dover and Hazeldonk and numerous other tax forms. So far he
has sent eight separate forms to London, but at least retains
some humor: "With all the paper I've got to sit on I needn't
have bought a sofa in the first place."
