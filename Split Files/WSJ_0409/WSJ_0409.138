   Most companies are a bit like Hydras: Cut off a head and
others appear, often indistinguishable from the first. But
sometimes there are those extraordinary leaders, with skill,
drive and vision, who aren't so easily replaced.
   Losing such a luminary can mean big trouble. A key lawyer
or sales star who exits can take major clients away or leave
dissatisfied ones. Hotshot computer programmers who defect
can send a company skidding. And high-rolling investment
bankers who depart often leave unfinished deals in their
wake. So the question is, how do you keep superstars from
bolting?

   Some management specialists say it's impossible to corral
executives determined to flee. "I'm not sure anyone could
have kept Peter Lynch," says Gil Gordon, a Monmouth Junction,
N.J., consultant who specializes in employee retention
strategies. The stellar Mr. Lynch last month said he will
quit his job managing Fidelity Investments' $13 billion
Magellan Fund in order to spend more time with his family.
Still, Mr. Gordon and others say companies often lose key
creative talent when they don't have to.
   The secret, experts say, is determining what the stars
want. Money, of course, is high on the list, but so are the
intangibles of recognition and challenge, as well as the
emotional investment of owning a company. Flexibility and
time away from the fast track are also important. Here are
some of the suggestions from management specialists on how to
hold on to irreplaceable performers:
                                                                                                       

   MONEY
                                                                                                       

   Dollars are the first thing many people think of.
   That explains why many companies design programs to make
it expensive for a key executive to leave. For example, they
give packages of restricted stock that executives can't touch
until near retirement age -- say, 55 or 60 years old.
   Such packages might be worth five to 10 times an
individual's salary. But companies seeking to keep a star
from leaving can go much higher. Roger Brossy, a principal
with compensation consultants Sibson &amp; Co., says he is
working with a Fortune 500 company that's trying to attract a
key executive; the manager's current firm, though, is
offering him stock worth 20 times his $300,000 to $400,000
annual salary to stay. He hasn't made up his mind yet.
   Yet, Carl Menk, chairman of search firm Canny Bowen Inc.,
adds: "Money won't move {a star} unless there's also an
improvement in career path. The No. 1 reason people leave is
that they see their career decelerating.
                                                                                                       

   RECOGNITION
                                                                                                       

   Many consultants agree that money isn't everything,
especially for superstars who may have more than they need.
"Reward systems have three components: economic social and
psychological," says Robert E. Kelley, a business professor
at Carnegie Mellon University. "More often than not, {stars}
want artistic freedom and recognition more than they want
money. They see themselves making long-term contributions to
the firm."
   J. Gerald Simmons, president of Handy Associates, an
executive-search firm, cites a bank that moved quickly to
hold a computer whiz who was ready to jump ship to a
competitor. The bank not only boosted his salary and bonus,
it doubled his responsibility, had him report to a vice
chairman instead of a lower-level official, and placed him in
the long-term executive incentive program. "The money was
important, but the key thing was being recognized as a
participant," says Mr. Simmons. The star employee is still
with that bank.
                                                                                                       

   OWNERSHIP
                                                                                                       

   Four years ago, Barbara Provus was well-paid, happy with
her job, and not dissatisfied with the management of the
executive recruiting firm, Lamalie Associates, for which she
worked. But that didn't prevent her and three colleagues from
quitting en masse to found their own firm. Two other
colleagues soon followed -- a loss of six individuals from a
22-person firm. What could have induced them to stay?
   "In real estate, it's location, location, location. For
us, it was equity, equity, equity," says Ms. Provus, today a
principal at Sweeney Shepherd, a search firm in Chicago.
"Many times, the `other opportunity' either offers more
equity or more of a voice in management -- or the perception
of more of a voice in management."
   Later, Lamalie Associates was sold to its partners and
since then the concern hasn't lost anyone it has wanted to
retain, says Jack Wissman, a vice president. Adds Ms. Provus:
"There's nothing like feeling you are an owner to really form
a strong commitment."
                                                                                                       

   CHALLENGE
                                                                                                       

   For many years Kenichi Ohmae wasn't just important to
McKinsey &amp; Co. in Japan. "Ken WAS McKinsey," says William
Matassoni, a partner in the giant consulting firm. "If he had
left five years ago, we would have had big trouble. In Japan,
we wouldn't have been able to survive Ken leaving." While
there was never any active prospect that the expert on
Japanese business and managerial style would depart, Mr.
Matassoni says the company wanted to keep it that way.
   "We gave him lots of new challenges," says Mr. Matassoni.
He worked with clients in new ways, handled more counseling
and fewer traditional product-market studies. Mr. Ohmae also
devoted more attention to writing books, and to taking strong
-- and controversial -- stands on trade issues and
protectionism. McKinsey also restructured its operations to
free Mr. Ohmae from many day-to-day tasks, giving him more
free time, and giving others more responsibility.
   "McKinsey is still a great place for Ken Ohmae to be,"
says Mr. Matassoni. "You can't ask people to stay. They have
to want to stay. You have to make sure your organization is
the place for them to be. As soon as they think of it as a
con tract, you are probably losing the battle."
   "I appreciate the firm and the colleagues who have allowed
me to do these things. They've allowed me to explore these
mind-stretching exercises," says Mr. Ohmae, who plans to stay
with the firm until his retirement -- in 2003.
                                                                                                       

   FREEDOM
                                                                                                       

   Back in the mid-1980s, Tektronix Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.,
had a problem: Venture capital was flooding into the Pacific
Northwest, with the very real possibility of seducing away
the company's best people and ideas. So the maker of
electronic equipment had a brainstorm: Let them go, but
acquire a piece of the action. It founded Tektronix
Development Co., a $30 million fund with the mandate of
financing Tektronix's managers' good ideas.
   Tektronix feels that if it can't use an idea itself, "we
will spin you out and fund you, or part of you, so that in a
way, we hang on to you," says Richard Hill, vice president of
the development company.
   In the six years since the fund's founding, the company
has financed a dozen ventures, about half are from outsiders
but the other half are from Tektronix managers. "They are no
longer employees of Tektronix per se, but we have access to
them, and to whatever they come out with," says Mr. Hill.
                                                                                                       

   TIME
                                                                                                       

   Magellan Fund's Mr. Lynch, in announcing his departure,
said he was tired of working seven days a week. Burnout is
common among stars. And so, consultants recommend that
companies be ready to let good people go -- temporarily. "One
of the hallmarks of the creative employers is that they are
willing to flex and bend," says Mr. Gordon. "All too often
employers let their good people walk away because they aren't
flexible." Fidelity says the company discussed many options
with Mr. Lynch, but that it "respects" his final decision to
leave.
