   Beer isn't a product usually associated with the Spanish,
but Spain's largest brewer, Cruz del Campo S.A., is expected
to be auctioned to a foreign buyer soon for around $1
billion.
   Investment analysts in Spain say they believe the asking
price for Cruz, which has been on the block for several
months, is between 120 billion pesetas ($1.1 billion) and 130
billion pesetas ($1.2 billion).

   Goldman Sachs International Ltd., a London unit of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., says the auction has attracted global
interest but declines to give a price range. Cruz's owners
aim to complete the transaction by the end of June, an
executive familiar with the situation says.
   The auction is a matter of some urgency for at least one
of Cruz's owners, Stroh Brewery Co., Detroit, which holds
about 29% of the Spanish brewer's shares. The sale would
provide a badly needed infusion of cash for Stroh, whose
agreement to sell most of its American beer operations to
Adolph Coors Co. fell through in December.
   Cashing in on what used to be regarded as a backwater of
Stroh's empire would provide "rain on parched earth" as the
American brewer struggles to put its finances in order, says
Tom Pirko, a beverage consultant at Bevmark Inc., Los
Angeles. Combined with a sale of some U.S. assets, the
Spanish proceeds might allow Stroh to limp on as an
independent brewer, Mr. Pirko says.
   For potential buyers, Cruz offers a well-established
distribution network in one of the few major countries where
beer sales are still growing.
   As it has grown more popular among Spanish youth, beer has
taken market share away from the country's traditional
tipple, wine (just as wine sales are growing at the expense
of beer in Northern Europe). Industry executives say the beer
market has grown about 4% annually by volume over the past
decade. In money terms, sales more than doubled to 258
billion pesetas last year from 105 billion pesetas five years
before.
   Brewers see plenty of scope for further froth. Though
per-capita beer consumption already has risen to about 71
liters from 45 liters in 1974, it remains far below West
Germany's 146 liters. Even if Spaniards never take to
swilling beer in Germanic volumes, the Spanish industry
figures it can narrow the gap considerably.
   The industry also can count on heavy sales to the 50
million or so tourists who flood into Spain each summer. Many
tourists prefer imported beers, however, and that makes Spain
all the more attractive to foreign brewers looking for new
outlets.
   Goldman Sachs has asked the potential buyers poring over
Cruz's books not to talk about the sale, but at least two
brewers -- Interbrew S.A. of Belgium and Heineken N.V. of the
Netherlands -- have confirmed they are having a look. One
executive involved in the sale says that at least several
more companies are also pursuing the matter.
   Some analysts say BSN S.A. of France, which owns the
French brewer Kronenbourg, is among the potential buyers, but
BSN declines to comment. Kronenbourg already owns a major
stake in Mahou S.A., a Madrid brewer.
   Carlsberg AS of Denmark, which has a majority stake in
another Spanish brewer, Union Cervecera S.A., also declines
to say whether it is bidding for Cruz.
   So far, foreign brewers haven't found Spain an easy
market. Svend Pedersen, an executive vice president at
Carlsberg, acknowledges that Union Cervecera has been
unprofitable, but says the Danish company is confident about
turning it around. A Heineken spokesman says profit at its
51%-owned Aguila S.A. unit was "under pressure" last year as
the Madrid brewer shouldered the costs of closing some
breweries and upgrading others.
   Because Cruz's shares aren't publicly traded, analysts
know little about the company's finances, but they say Cruz
is profitable and appears to have good growth prospects.
Including stakes in other brewers, Cruz has a market share
estimated at 22%, with annual production of about 5.9 million
hectoliters.
   Banco Hispano, one of Spain's largest banks, owns about 8%
of Cruz and says it might hang on to the stake when the
others sell, though a financial source said he expects
Hispano to sell if the price is right. Other shareholders
include the Andalusian families of Ibarra, Osborne, Laffite
and Delgado.
   Before putting itself on the block internationally, Cruz
approached several Spanish beer and food companies to see
whether a deal could be struck at home. Sources close to
Torras S.A., the holding company for the Kuwait Investment
Office's interests in Spain, say that company declined to buy
Cruz because the price was far too high and the brewer didn't
fit into Torras's strategy.
   Once a buyer is found, a further realignment probably lies
ahead for the Spanish beer industry, says Jose Angel
Gonzalez, chief analyst at the Madrid stockbrokerage
Iberagentes SV. He predicts a period of consolidation in
which the six big brewers will be whittled down to three.
   "The battle for market share that is taking place in other
parts of Europe is about to hit Spain," Mr. Gonzalez says.
