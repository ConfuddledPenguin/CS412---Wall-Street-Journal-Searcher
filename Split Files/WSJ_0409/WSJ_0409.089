   NEPAL'S KING ANNOUNCED the establishment of a multiparty
system.
   Bowing to demands by the country's pro-democracy
opposition, King Birenda said a multiparty political system
would be formed in the Himalayan kingdom, and he scrapped a
29-year-old ban on political parties. Opposition leaders
agreed to end a 50-day-old protest movement. The move came
after at least 50 people were killed Friday in Katmandu after
troops opened fire as thousands of protesters marched on the
monarch's palace to demand democratic freedoms.
