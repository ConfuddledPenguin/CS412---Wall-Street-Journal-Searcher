   NEW YORK -- Martin Greenberg has a full agenda for his new
two-year term as chairman of the Commodity Exchange, the
nation's leading metals market.
   Besides firming up the exchange's financial footing, Mr.
Greenberg will try to get the much-discussed merger of the
Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange moving. Merger
talks among New York futures exchanges have been on and off
for at least 10 years, but nothing has ever happened.

   Although the current talks will resume this month, after a
break for the election of Comex officers last month, some
observers think a merger still will be tough to achieve.
   Mr. Greenberg, now 50 years old, began in commodities as a
"local," or independent floor trader, in 1976. "I got started
in commodities by checking three books on the subject out of
the library and reading them," Mr. Greenberg recalls. "I then
stood behind an experienced trader in the silver pit and
watched what he did."
   Today, Mr. Greenberg is chairman of Sterling Commodities
Corp., a New York-based futures and options broker that is a
clearing firm on the Comex. (All trades done on an exchange
must be processed through a clearing member of the exchange.
Such firms accept and process exchange transactions, collect
margin, or good-faith money, and insure financial settlements
between their customers and the exchange's clearing house.)
   His primary task, Mr. Greenberg says, "is getting the
exchange to function as a well-run business." Over the past
couple of months, the exchange has reduced its staff about
20%, reflecting lagging trading activity.
   Last year, futures trading in copper and precious metals
at the Comex increased by only 1.4%, while volume at all U.S.
futures exchanges rose 8.7%. Options trading at the Comex
decreased 12.9% while total options trading of all the
exchanges rose 12.8%. In the first quarter of this year,
trading picked up somewhat -- futures trading rose by 3.1%
and options volume jumped 27.8% -- primarily because of
action in gold.
   The Comex has long been searching for a successful new
product to boost trading volume. The last attempt was a
contract based on the Moody's Corporate Grade Bond Index.
About 11,000 contracts traded before it died in 1987.
   Last July, the exchange lured Arnold Staloff away from the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange to be its new president and chief
executive officer and to spur the development of new
contracts; he had been head of new-product development at the
Philadelphia exchange. Comex has not announced any new
products since Mr. Staloff's arrival.
   As for the proposed merger, it's no secret that Mr.
Greenberg favors it. In addition to the five Comex seats he
owns, Mr. Greenberg also owns four on the New York Merc, two
on the New York Cotton Exchange, and one seat each on the
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Mr. Greenberg says a merger would benefit both Comex and
the New York Merc, which trades crude oil and other energy
futures and options, plus platinum and palladium. "It's the
equivalent of baseball, apple pie and mom," he says, because
it would reduce operating costs and give the merged exchanges
a stronger voice in Washington.
   Some industry observers say the existence of five
independent New York exchanges is a luxury they can't afford
anymore, when the two Chicago exchanges are doing more than
75% of the futures and option business in the U.S. Moreover,
the New York Merc now does more than 50% of all the trading
done by the New York exchanges because of its energy
contracts. Based on last year's numbers, a combined Merc and
Comex would have done about 18% of the futures volume and 16%
of the option volume in the U.S., making it a more formidable
competitor to the huge Chicago exchanges.
   Nonetheless, negotiating an agreement acceptable to 772
Comex members and 760 New York Merc members won't be easy,
according to people close to the merger talks. "If it were up
to Lou (Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the Merc) and me, we
could work out an agreement over lunch," Mr. Greenberg says.
As it is, any plan must be approved by at least two-thirds of
each exchange's members. Also representing Comex in the
negotiations is Robert Fink, whom Mr. Greenberg succeeded as
Comex chairman.
   Mr. Greenberg notes that the merger proposal could run
aground on almost any issue, even one that the merger
negotiators themselves consider innocuous. An acceptable
agreement must have the right "bells and whistles" in it, he
says.
   An initial issue that was thought to be a sticking point
had to do with seat prices. Seats on the Merc sell for
roughly twice the price of those on Comex. For example, a
Merc seat sold for $192,000 on March 21, while a Comex seat
sold for $100,000 last Tuesday. The merger committee
sidestepped that issue by agreeing that there would be no
crossover trading -- members of each exchange will be
permitted to trade only their contracts. According to a Merc
official, there are no plans to have a "super seat" whose
owner would have trading rights on both exchanges. However,
new products that are related neither to metals nor energy
would be open to members of both exchanges.
   Mr. Greenberg believes the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission's new rule on who may be a member of exchange
boards and certain committees could make governing more
difficult. The rule bars members with histories of trading
violations and suspensions from those positions. In some
cases, he says, rigid application of this rule could be
tantamount to "disqualifying a person from running for office
for a jaywalking ticket." He adds, however, that the rule is
appropriate for someone who demeans the integrity of the
market.
   Though he no longer trades regularly in the pit, Mr.
Greenberg's family is well-represented on the Comex floor.
His son, David, 25, is a "local" in the gold pit, and his
son-in-law, Eric Plateis, 30, does the same in the silver
pit.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Has West Texas Intermediate crude finally joined the world
oil market? This week's activity in the New York Merc's crude
pit may supply the answer. It could determine if last week's
fall in West Texas Intermediate futures prices means that the
U.S. benchmark no longer can remain aloof from the rest of
the crudes.
   West Texas has been under pressure since January. But
prices for other crudes, such as the "sours" with high sulfur
content, fell faster. Then, West Texas suddenly lost its
lofty perch, if only temporarily.
   Several reasons were cited by oil analysts for last week's
plunge of $1.13 a barrel in the price of the May contract.
One major factor, they said, was new evidence that a glut of
crudes was developing because of high OPEC output. But also
important was the dashing of hopes that gasoline demand would
continue to climb, supporting the "sweet" crudes such as West
Texas, which have a high yield of the light fuels. Instead of
rising, gasoline demand is showing evidence of slowing.
"Demand is flat," one analyst said.
   Analysts generally assume that prices of West Texas as
well as other crudes will go lower before recovering. But
timing of the turnaround is debated. Until recent days, most
analysts expected prices to turn up sometime in the second
half after a seasonal softening in the second quarter. But
more are now looking for an earlier rebound. Fereidun
Fesharaki of the Resource Systems Institute at Honolulu's
East-West Center forecasts that West Texas will be back up to
$20.75 a barrel in June after dropping to $18 a barrel in
May. On Friday, the price of West Texas for May delivery
settled at $19.15.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Analysts said they were awaiting two Agriculture
Department reports due tomorrow as an indication of futures
prices direction over the next several days. The department's
world crop report will give analysts and traders a better
idea of the size of crops being harvested in the southern
hemisphere. A bumper Brazilian soybean crop in particular has
been weighing on U.S. soybean prices for the past several
weeks. A report on U.S. crop supply and demand figures as of
April 1 will be a guide to "old crop," or last season's
harvest, and corn and wheat prices, analysts said. Analysts
said they were also concerned that many trend-following
commodity funds may start selling off their substantial corn
futures holdings based on Friday's slump in prices. On
Friday, soybean and corn futures prices rallied sharply in
early trading on unfounded rumors that a nuclear accident had
occurred in the Soviet Union. The rumors appeared to have
been generated by a report -- on continuing radioactive
contamination caused by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant
meltdown -- delivered in late March by Soviet scientists at a
medical ethics conference in Poland. Word of the scientists'
report, which advocated mass evacuations of parts of
Belorussia that remain contaminated by the Chernobyl
accident, were carried in the European press Wednesday and
Thursday. Wheat futures for May delivery closed down 4.75
cents a bushel Friday at $3.65 a bushel. May corn and soybean
futures both closed one cent a bushel lower at $2.695 and
$5.95 a bushel, respectively.
                                                                                                       

   Cocoa
                                                                                                       

   The rally that has carried cocoa to a nine-month high of
$1,285 per metric ton on Thursday from a 14-year low of $900
last fall may soon begin to run into some resistance,
analysts say.
   Brazil, the only major producer to harvest a substantial
second crop, or midcrop, will have fresh supplies of cocoa in
coming weeks. This will help to satisfy some of the demand
for cocoa beans and could slow the rise in prices, analysts
say.
   However, dry weather in Brazil and West Africa, two of the
world's principal growing areas, will continue to cause
uncertainty in the market and support prices, analysts say.
West Africa, which includes such major cocoa-growing
countries as the Ivory Coast, the world's top producer, and
Nigeria and Ghana, has had only a fraction of its normal
rainfall in the past two months.
   However, the critical West African pod-setting season,
which runs from June through August, is still some time away.
This creates the possibility of significant rainfall before
then, which could help the cocoa crop.
