   TV: Maria Shriver is leaving as co-anchor of NBC's "Sunday
Today" and anchor on the Saturday edition of "NBC Nightly
News." Upon her return from maternity leave, Ms. Shriver
yesterday told viewers of "Sunday Today" that her weekly
commute from her home in California to the East Coast to do
the "Nightly News" and "Sunday Today" had grown too difficult
following the birth of her first child in December. Ms.
Shriver, who is married to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, will
work on a series of NBC prime-time news specials and segments
for the week-night news program. No successor to Ms. Shriver
in either job was announced.
