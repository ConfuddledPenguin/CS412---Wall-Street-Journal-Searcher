   NEW YORK -- Take 70 nervous securities analysts, add some
federal regulators determined not to end up in the Capitol
Hill pillory with M. Danny Wall and, voila, you have Wall
Street's latest concoction: bank stocks flambe.
   That's what was served up last week when bank stocks got
scorched across a broad front and investors dumped everything
from the golden likes of J.P. Morgan to the tarnished Bank of
New England.

   In two meetings last week with accountants and securities
analysts, the U.S. comptroller of the currency sought to
clear the air over reports that bank examiners had changed
the rules on what constitutes a non-performing loan. But
instead of dispelling misconceptions, the regulators only
added to the pall hanging over bank stocks.
   "The meeting reinforced the view that banking companies
are guilty until proven innocent," says James J. McDermott
Jr., research director at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. "It's a
time unlike any in my 13 years as a bank analyst."
   Katherine Hensel, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, thinks
that's the effect the regulators wanted: "The regulators'
intent wasn't to scare us but to enlist our support as
watchdogs to discipline the banks. What better regulator is
there than the marketplace?"
   Maybe, but investors mowed down the bank stocks
indiscriminately. Now is the time for bold bank investors to
step forward, some investors say. Ann Robinson, a bond
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, says, "You'll look
back on this as a time of good buying opportunities."
   The extreme slump in bank stocks could easily persist
through early June as regulators continue their reviews of
real estate loans and highly leveraged deals. Meanwhile
analysts suggest that investors start nibbling at selected
stocks on signs of weakness.
   At current prices, dividend yields on many big banks are
about 7%, double the market average of 3.5%. Such a wide gap
presaged rallies in bank stocks in the early 1980s and after
the stock market crash in 1987. There are values in bonds,
too, some yielding 15% and more.
   Any bargain hunter's short list has to include Citicorp.
At $22.875 a share, it's trading well below year-end book
value of $25.39 and at only about 6 times some analysts'
earnings estimates for this year. Citicorp's consumer
business alone (profit of possibly $1 billion, or $3 a share,
this year) justifies the current stock price, some say. The
icing on the cake is a 7.2% yield, with a dividend increase
expected before long.
   Citicorp sticks out like a lightning rod in the storm
surrounding bank stocks. It is the nation's biggest lender to
commercial real estate and highly leveraged transactions
($12.6 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively). But rivals
lack Citicorp's global presence and leadership in such
diverse areas as credit cards, home mortgages and foreign
exchange. Citicorp has what Chairman John S. Reed calls
"granularity" in loans -- portfolios broadly diversified by
geography and customer. Commercial real estate loans in the
company's home state, New York, represent only 10% of its
real estate loans. And domestic commercial real estate loans
account for only 7.5% of Citicorp's global commercial and
consumer loan portfolio.
   Citicorp in recent years has been doing more
five-to-seven-year mortgage loans -- considerably safer than
construction loans, which are down to about 40% of its
portfolio from 60% six or seven years ago. Still, some think
non-performing real estate loans could double again this
year, to $2.2 billion by year-end.
   For highly leveraged deals, Citicorp's first-quarter
results will show a jump in non-performing assets. The
bankruptcy-law filing by Campeau Corp.'s Allied and Federated
alone will add $288 million to the year-end $407 million. But
highly leveraged deals accounted for only 3.8% of Citicorp's
operating earnings last year, compared with 37% for Bank of
Boston, 10% for Bank of New York and 10% for Manufacturers
Hanover.
   Citicorp's biggest negative: Reserve coverage is on the
light side, with a $5.2 billion loan-loss reserve to cover
$8.6 billion of non-performing loans at year-end. It will
need to eat into earnings more just to maintain 61% coverage,
much less reach a more respectable 70%. Coupled with its
stated goal of boosting core equity to 4.5% from 3.6% of
assets -- a $2 billion rise -- through retained earnings and
asset sales, Citicorp will be stretched this year.
   Among other banks, Chase Manhattan hasn't shown its
rival's creativity, but has a more conservative credit
culture and a stronger capital base. Norwest, Mellon Bank and
BankAmerica have spent recent years rebuilding themselves,
and have relatively small exposures in real estate and
debt-heavy deals.
