   WASHINGTON -- Alternative fuels for automobiles are at the
center of what will probably be the hottest environment vs.
industry battle in the House floor debate on clean-air
legislation.
   The House's chief environmentalist, Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.), is promising to try to resurrect President Bush's
proposal last year to require auto makers to produce one
million cars a year by 1997 that run on fuels, such as
methanol, that are cleaner than gasoline. Auto makers and the
oil industry have succeeded in killing the requirement in the
Senate and so far in the House.

   Mr. Waxman says he also will propose strengthening the
clean-air bill passed late Thursday by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee to expand the use of reformulated gasoline
in smoggy cities and of even cleaner-burning fuels such as
natural gas in centrally fueled fleets.
   Mr. Waxman's proposal sets up a titanic confrontation with
Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House's chief defender of
the auto industry and the powerful chairman of the commerce
panel. Unless the two can strike a compromise before the
clean-air bill is taken up by the full House late this month
or in early May, "this will be the environmental vote on the
House floor," Mr. Waxman says.
   In fact, the alternative-fuels issue is one of the few big
league disputes left for the House following a series of
unusual bipartisan deals between Mr. Dingell and Mr. Waxman,
who are traditionally enemies in clean-air issues, and other
members of the panel.
   The committee locked up compromises on the major clean-air
provisions for reducing acid rain, smog in cities, tailpipe
exhaust and toxic industrial emissions. And members agreed to
stick to their guns on the issues through the House debate
and through arduous talks ahead with the Senate over
differences in clean-air provisions.
   "Most of the major areas of controversy have been removed
from this bill," Mr. Dingell said. Added Mr. Waxman, "It's
unlikely that any of these compromises are going to be
changed on the House floor." Unlike the Senate, which cut
bargains in closed-door talks with the White House before
floor action, the Bush administration wasn't deeply involved
in House committee negotiations.
   The compromises spare the House from deeply divisive
fights over subsidies for socalled dirty Midwestern utilities
hardest hit by the cost of acid-rain controls and over
reducing cancer deaths from factory fumes even at the expense
of closing plants.
   Mr. Dingell and Republican House members who are concerned
about the economic costs of the legislation, whose price tag
for industry ranges from $19 billion and $21.5 billion
annually by the year 2005, accepted tougher controls on
industry than they might have liked. But in return, they're
spared from even more stringent requirements that many
observers think could have been adopted on the House floor in
today's political climate, which is charged with concern for
the environment.
   Mr. Waxman said that rather than gamble on winning big
environmental votes on the House floor, he decided to settle
for solid solutions that stand a better chance of becoming
law because they will carry the support of key House
Republicans and Mr. Dingell in negotiations with the Senate.
   The compromises achieved by the House also have the
surprising effect of pleasing both industry and
environmentalists to a greater degree than a bill passed last
week by the Senate.
   Neither industry nor environmentalists are entirely happy
with the House bill. But both saw the greatest improvement in
the House panel's provisions for reducing toxic factory
emissions, which are blamed for causing at least 3,000 cancer
deaths a year.
   The House version "removes the automatic shutdown threat
{for coke ovens}, and that's why the steel industry likes
it," said John Stinson, a National Steel Corp. official
lobbying for the industry. Steelmakers claim a majority of
coke ovens would be closed under the Senate's provisions to
reduce cancer risks for people living next to plants.
   David Doniger, an air toxics expert with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, likewise prefers the House version
over the Senate's because the House measure requires cleanups
from smaller sources such as dry cleaners and drops
provisions that he says wouldn't eliminate cancer risks to
plant neighbors.
   The main reason the House bill is acceptable to both
sides, however, is probably that it effectively defers for
seven to 10 years the most contentious issue of how to cut
cancer risks that remain after industries have already
installed the best available technology. That technology
would reduce emissions 75% to 90%.
   Besides alternative fuels, other unresolved issues are
narrower but still contentious. Talks on some of them could
yield compromises before full House action, lawmakers said.
   Rep. Jim Bates (D., Calif.), with the support of
environmentalists, is expected to seek a total phase-out in
the U.S. before the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons,
chemicals blamed for destroying the atmosphere's protective
ozone layer. The Senate has already adopted a similar
provision. There also will likely be an attempt to draw
limits on the use of certain substitute chemicals now being
developed by such companies as Du Pont Co.
   Two sideline issues on toxic industrial emissions are
still being debated. Environmentalists and industry will
likely take opposing views on defining the minimum amount of
controls that existing factories should be forced to install.
Environmentalists, concerned about accidents like the deadly
release several years ago in Bhopal, India, are also seeking
provisions to prevent and investigate chemical accidents in
the U.S.
   Also in the works are amendments to remedy pollution
problems in national parks, to fix both small businesses' and
environmentalists' problems with a proposed national program
for issuing operating permits to all polluters, and possibly
to lengthen warranty requirements now in the House bill
covering automobile air pollution equipment.
