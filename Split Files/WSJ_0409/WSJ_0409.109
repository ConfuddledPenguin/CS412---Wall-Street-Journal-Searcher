   PARIS -- The Group of Seven industrial countries said the
yen's recent decline has "undesirable consequences" for world
economic adjustment, but brushed aside Japanese calls for
coordinated interest-rate actions to support the shaky
currency.
   The group, which includes the finance ministers and
central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada, also agreed to keep
financial market developments, especially the yen's decline,
"under review."

   In a joint statement released after their one-day meeting
here Saturday, members of the world's most powerful economic
club implied that they might continue intervening in the
foreign-exchange markets to try to counter weakness in the
yen. The participants reaffirmed their commitment to economic
policy coordination, including "cooperation in exchange
markets," the statement said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in a briefing with
reporters after the G-7 meeting, highlighted the negative
effect of the yen's decline on the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, which totaled $49 billion in 1989. "There's more
burden on that than there was before," he said. A falling yen
makes Japanese goods cheaper for U.S. and other foreign
buyers.
   "There's no question we aren't happy with what has
happened with the yen," said Canadian Finance Minister
Michael Wilson.
   Japan has been pressing for coordinated international
interest-rate moves -- and particularly cuts in U.S. and West
German interest rates  -- to help the Japanese stabilize the
weakening yen. Such moves would reduce the attraction of the
dollar and the mark and hence help shore up the Japanese
currency. But the U.S. and Germany are reluctant to take such
steps, fearing they might boost inflation while economic
growth remains relatively strong.
   In Tokyo Monday morning, the dollar opened sharply lower,
sinking quickly toward 155 yen to the dollar. Market
participants said traders were responding to Japanese
newspapers' optimistic coverage of the Paris meeting.
   At the close of the morning session, the dollar finished
at 156.70 yen, compared with 157.65 yen at New York's Friday
close, and the stock market posted solid gains, with the
Nikkei index at 30165.45, up 886.67 points, or 3%, from
Friday's close.
   A report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest
business daily, said the G-7 countries were expected to sell
their own currencies and buy yen in an effort to support the
yen. It wasn't immediately clear whether such actions would
occur. At midmorning, Bank of Japan was reported to be
intervening in the market but in small amounts intended to
smooth out some of the sharp early swings in trading.
   The G-7 meeting, which was primarily held to survey world
economic developments, also included discussion of a
projected capital increase for the International Monetary
Fund; developments in Eastern Europe; and Germany's expected
economic and monetary union, which the group's statement said
"could contribute to improved global growth and to a
reduction of external imbalances in Europe."
   That endorsement, sought by the West Germans, was given
following a "commitment made by the Germans" to try to avoid
increased interest rates as a result of its monetary union,
French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said after the
meeting. He added that he hoped the process of German
economic unification would recycle West German surpluses in
Europe.
   In the coming unification of the East and West German
currencies, the West Germans will effectively be subsidizing
the exchange rate. This would mean a potentially inflationary
one-time change in the stock of West German money.
   Commenting generally on the G-7 gathering, Treasury
Secretary Brady said, "we moved the consensus forward" on a
range of issues, including IMF matters, Eastern Europe and
the need to boost savings. "We have around the world --
though particularly in the U.S. -- a shortage of savings," he
said. But the group didn't detail how savings should be
boosted.
   The recent weakness of the yen, however, has been the
matter of most immediate concern to the G-7 countries. It has
declined about 10% this year against the dollar, and already
forced Japan to raise its discount rate to 5.25% from 4.25%.
The discount rate is a benchmark rate at which the central
bank extends funds to financial institutions.
   The move in Japan's discount rate came despite a rout in
the Japanese stock market, where the Nikkei index of major
stocks has fallen more than 20% this year. Many analysts
expect that Japan soon may have to raise interest rates again
in the event of continued yen weakness.
   While they had hoped for more explicit assistance, the
Japanese tried to put a brave face on the outcome of the G-7
meeting. The wording of the group's statement "is very
strong," Makoto Utsumi, the Japanese Finance Ministry's vice
minister for international affairs, said in an interview. "It
is the first time to single out the yen" he added, alluding
to the group's unprecedented attention to his country's
currency.
   In recent days, the U.S. and other G-7 nations have
emphasized that Japan is responsible for stabilizing its
financial markets. "It's up to the Japanese to keep these
developments under close surveillance. The situation should
become more stable," France's Mr. Beregovoy said after the
meeting.
   The Japanese would seem to have been in a strong
bargaining position over the weekend. Only last Thursday,
they agreed to lower a variety of trade barriers, steps that
could open their economy to goods and services from abroad.
Although the U.S. agreed to make some concessions to the
Japanese, the accord may have given more to the U.S. than to
Japan.
   Yet, despite making those concessions at the trade
bargaining table, the Japanese failed to win much of
substance at the G-7 table. In fact, officials of the
Treasury and the State Department denied that anyone even
tried to make any trade-offs between the two sets of talks.
   The G-7, which generally gathers about three times a year,
probably will have another chance to review Japan's situation
soon. Canada's Mr. Wilson said they may well reconvene before
the IMF's policymaking interim committee holds its midyear
meeting in early May in Washington.
   Mr. Wilson, who chairs the powerful interim committee,
said the Paris meeting hadn't reached a consensus on the size
of the IMF's projected increase in capital. "I think we're
getting close to a consensus (of an increase) in the range of
50% to two-thirds -- and closer to the lower end of that
range," he said. The IMF currently has capital of about $120
billion.
   There was, however, no mention of the IMF in the G-7
statement, and the group is sensitive to charges that it may
be deciding IMF matters outside the appropriate forum. "It
isn't up to us to decide," said Mr. Beregovoy. "We are moving
toward an increase in resources, but the interim committee
will decide."
