   WATERFORD WEDGWOOD PLC (London) -- Jim Colleran resigned
as chief executive officer for the Americas of this troubled
Anglo-Irish glass and dinnerware maker. Mr. Colleran, who
joined the company in 1983 as executive vice president of
Waterford Crystal Inc., left "to pursue other career
interests," the company said. He will be succeeded
temporarily by director of overseas sales and marketing,
Redmond O'Donoghue. Waterford Wedgwood, which reported a 1989
pretax loss of 20.6 million punts ($32.5 million), last month
announced a capital restructuring built around a 29.9% stake
jointly held by Fitzwilton Holdings PLC and Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co.
