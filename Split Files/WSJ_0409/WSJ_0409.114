   MAJOR REALTY Corp. (Orlando, Fla.) -- James A. Adams III,
the 45-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of this
real-estate developer, assumed the additional post of
president. He takes over the duties of Robert J. Pliska, who
resigned, a company spokeswoman said, for personal reasons
related to relocating from his home in Michigan to Florida.
The spokeswoman said she couldn't elaborate, and Mr. Pliska,
who joined Major Realty last December, couldn't be reached.
