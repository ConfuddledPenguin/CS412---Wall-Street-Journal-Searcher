   NEW ORLEANS -- McDermott International Inc. said 98% of
the six million warrants to purchase shares of its common
were exercised on or before the expiration date last Monday.
The company received $122.4 million in principal amount of
incorporated 10% subordinated debentures due 2003 and $24.9
million in cash as payment of the exercise price of the
warrants. About 6,335,000 additional common shares have been
issued in connection with the exercise of the warrants,
bringing the total number of shares outstanding to
43,860,225.
   Approximately $27.6 million of the debentures remain
outstanding. Neither the company nor its McDermott Inc. unit
has any current intention to purchase the remaining debt, the
company said.
