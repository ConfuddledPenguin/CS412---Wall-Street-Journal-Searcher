DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)

   WALLINGFORD, Conn. -- Dime Financial Corp. expects to post
first-quarter earnings from flat to as much as 7% higher, as
the bank conservatively forgoes substantial loan growth in a
weakened Northeast real estate environment.
   John C. Shortell, president and chief executive officer,
said Dime expects to report per-share earnings of 35 cents to
38 cents a share, or $1.9 million to $2 million, compared
with $1.9 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.

   The quarter went "pretty much as we expected," Mr.
Shortell said in an interview. For the year, he said, "We're
on target to earn a little bit more than last year's" $1.36 a
share. Analysts see $1.35 to $1.45 a share for the year at
the holding company for Dime Savings Bank of Wallingford and
City Savings Bank of Meriden. Mr. Shortell said the parent
should "fall within that range."
   The thrift has maintained its critical capital ratios at
the expense of increasing its loan base, Mr. Shortell said.
Total capital at March 31 was 11.3% of assets vs. 11.4% at
Dec. 31, and tangible capital -- subtracting good will -- was
10.7% vs. 10.8%.
   At the same time, he said total loans grew barely 1% to
$694 million at March 31. Nonperforming loans grew to 1.62%
of total loans from 1.33% at Dec. 31, but they fell from
1.84% at their Sept. 30 peak, Mr. Shortell said.
   Reserves for nonperforming loans at March 31 were $2.2
million, covering 20% of nonperforming loans, compared with
$2.1 million, covering 22%.
   "We're about as well positioned" as possible, Mr. Shortell
said. "The first point to make is that 60% of our loans are
in one-to four-family" housing. "As long as we avoid a
general recession, we'll get paid on time."
   Mr. Shortell also says thrifts that belong to the Federal
Home Loan Bank system until recently could borrow as much as
30% of their assets from the system to fund loans. "We have
leveraged capital this way," he says. But "when you come to a
time like this and can't stretch {to make} a loan, we take
deposits and reduce interest expense by paying down" the home
loan bank loans. At March 31, Dime had $169 million of home
loan bank borrowings compared with a Sept. 30 peak of $186
million.
   The bank doesn't see a major turnaround in either
residential or commercial real estate. "What we're hoping is
that the slide doesn't go any further," Mr. Shortell says.
"The key to Connecticut is that the unemployment rate" is
4.1% vs. 3.1% a year ago. "It's still not a bad number, but
where is it heading? Can Connecticut avoid 7% unemployment?
If it can, it will help us. If not, it adds a whole new layer
of problems" for the area.
   In this environment, "You make only the loans you're
comfortable with, keep non-interest expense as low as
possible," and "ride it out," Mr. Shortell says.
   "One of the good things about this crummy environment," he
says, is that banks that are "up to their ears in problem
loans" are forced to turn away even good credit risks. Dime
Financial is able to make some of those loans, he says.
   Dime Financial's nonperforming loans "may have peaked"
last fall, Mr. Shortell says. He adds that they aren't
"heading down in perfectly symmetrical fashion, but they are
heading downward. . . . I think we'll be able to keep
nonperforming loans below" 2% of total loans, he says.
   "What I'm more concerned with is: We made a profit in each
year of the 1980s," and earnings have grown for each of the
past seven years. "If the {loan} growth comes, it comes. If
the good loans aren't there, we're simply not going to
stretch."
