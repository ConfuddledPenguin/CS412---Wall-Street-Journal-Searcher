   General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit said it reduced
prices on most 1991 models of its sporty Chevrolet Camaro and
Pontiac Firebird, which went on sale in Canada last week.
   The new Firebird price policy differs from that in the
U.S., where the parent company last month raised the 1991
price of a standard, six-cylinder Firebird by 6% from the
1990 model, to $11,985.

   General Motors of Canada Ltd., based in Oshawa, Ontario,
said the base price of a 1991, six-cylinder Pontiac Firebird
with automatic transmission was reduced to 16,898 Canadian
dollars (UA$14,460) from C$17,805 for the 1990 model. The
price of a similarly equipped Camaro RS was reduced to
C$16,398 Canadian dollars from C$17,805.
