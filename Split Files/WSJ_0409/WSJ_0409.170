   WASHINGTON -- The conviction of former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter on all five felony charges vindicated
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's allegation that the
attempted Iran-Contra cover-up reached into the highest
levels of the Reagan administration.
   Mr. Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who counseled
the former president daily in late 1985 and 1986, was the
most senior Reagan administration official tried and
convicted on charges of concealing U.S. arms sales to Iran
and White House support for the Nicaraguan rebels during that
period.

   A federal court jury here returned guilty verdicts
Saturday on one count of conspiracy with former national
security aide Oliver North and others to obstruct Congress,
two separate counts of obstruction, and two counts of making
false statements -- all in connection with concealing Reagan
administration dealings either with the Contras or with Iran.
   The prosecution charged that Mr. Poindexter coordinated a
White House cover-up of arms supplies to the Nicaraguan
insurgency, which had been banned by Congress, and an
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran, which Mr. Reagan had
publicly denied.
   After the verdict, Dan Webb, the independent counsel's
lead trial lawyer, said, "High men in government office who
have the responsibility for the security of this nation ought
not to be allowed to commit crimes to pursue their own
self-interest." Mr. Webb had contended that Mr. Poindexter
deliberately misled Congress to protect the Reagan
administration from political embarrassment.
   Mr. Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, said the
defendant would appeal the conviction. Mr. Poindexter didn't
testify in his own defense at the trial.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene set June 11 as the date
for sentencing Mr. Poindexter, who is 53 years old. The
maximum sentence would be 25 years in prison and fines
totaling $1.25 million. None of the other six men convicted
on charges related to the Iran-Contra affair have been
sentenced to serve any prison time, let alone receive the
maximum sentences possible under law.
   Three Iran-Contra prosecutions are pending, including Mr.
North's appeal of his conviction. It isn't clear whether Mr.
Walsh intends to bring any new indictments related to the
affair.
   Mr. North, a close Poindexter associate in the biggest
presidential scandal since Watergate, ironically became the
prosecution's main witness. Though reluctant to implicate his
former boss, Mr. North nevertheless confirmed the
prosecution's central allegations when confronted with his
own testimony from prior legal proceedings. For example, he
testified that he saw Mr. Poindexter tear in half a
potentially embarrassing document in which Mr. Reagan had
authorized a 1985 U.S.-Iran arms transfer as an
arms-for-hostages deal.
   The court-appointed independent counsel, Mr. Walsh, had
previously dropped the central conspiracy and theft charges
against both Messrs. Poindexter and North because of concerns
over the disclosure of classified government information.
   The Poindexter trial contributed only a handful of
insights into the tangled events surrounding secret Reagan
administration activities abroad. The more significant
tidbits of information came from the videotaped testimony of
Mr. Reagan, who was called as a defense witness. The former
president confirmed for the first time that his
administration offered financial incentives in 1985 to at
least one friendly third country, Honduras, to encourage
military support for the Contras. President Bush, who was
vice president at the time, has repeatedly denied that there
were any such "quid pro quos."
   On the whole, the courtroom strategies of the prosecution
and defense precluded any startling discoveries. Mr. Webb
attempted to compact complicated secret transactions and
relationships to fit the narrow charges against Mr.
Poindexter. The prosecutor further narrowed his case by
dropping some 10 witnesses he had considered calling after
Mr. North provided his damaging testimony.
   The defense, in contrast, took a scattershot approach,
frequently switching subjects in an attempt to create an
impression of a diligent, honest military man. Mr. Beckler
rarely disputed the facts asserted by the prosecution,
choosing instead to stress Mr. Poindexter's relationship with
former President Reagan.
