   In your Feb. 21 Law-column item "Declaring Insolvency
Called a Bad Solution," St. Louis lawyer Donald B. Kramer
asserts that filing a bankruptcy petition can be a terrible
error.
   With proper counsel, bankruptcy is a sound and effective
strategy and can be beneficial, improving one's
credit-worthiness and reputation.

   Mr. Kramer's assertion suffers basic flaws:
   A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition can be filed only once
every seven years. In most bankruptcies, the debtor gets a
"clean slate" and thus is a more attractive candidate for
credit. While filing a bankruptcy petition may result in a
temporary "black mark," the benefits outweigh the negatives.
   Mr. Kramer implies that all problems can be worked out
amicably. However, many times it is either impossible or far
too costly in terms of legal fees to negotiate with
credit-card companies. If creditors established "workout
departments" specifically for consumer debts -- similar to
the departments that exist for commercial loans -- the
likelihood of amicable resolutions might be increased.
