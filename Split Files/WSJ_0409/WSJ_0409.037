   Set in the wild and beautiful Pacific Northwest, where the
mists hang over the treetops like a guillotine over a
condemned man, "Twin Peaks" (ABC, Thursdays, 9 p.m. EDT) is
the most startlingly idiosyncratic vision on TV today --
concocted by movie director David Lynch ("Eraserhead," "Blue
Velvet") and Mark Frost ("Hill Street Blues").
   In rural Washington state, Twin Peaks is a town of diners
and gas stations and high-school love affairs, a town where
"a yellow light still means slow down, not speed up." When
the region is shaken by the shocking murder of a high-school
homecoming queen, FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle
MacLachlan) and local sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael
Ontkean) are called in to investigate.

   Beneath the surface of this peaceful, scenic logging
community, they discover a Pandora's boxful of lust, greed,
hatred and illicit passion. And over the next several weeks,
as the series unrolls, they find that everyone seems to be
having affairs with everyone else, and several Twin Peaks
residents are engaged in behavior either illegal or bizarre.
   As anyone who's seen "Blue Velvet" knows, this is David
Lynch's world, a world at once mundane and lurid -- as
commonplace as apple pie, as deviant and twisted as razor
blades in Halloween apples. In Twin Peaks, there's the
high-school football team and the motorcycle gang, but it's
the bikers who turn out to be the good guys, while the
football stars are thoroughly rotten young men.
   Laura Palmer, the lovely cheerleader who's been killed,
had, in fact, been mixed up in porno films and cocaine deals
before her death. Expectations are constantly being
subverted: Fish turn up in coffee percolators; a strange old
woman wanders around town talking to a pet log.
   The central character, FBI Agent Cooper, is just as
wide-eyed and as cynical as Mr. Lynch himself. Cooper may be
naively enthusiastic about cherry pie and the smell of
Douglas fir trees, but he's sharp about his case. His mind
leaps ahead of the sincere local sheriff Truman as they
search for a serial killer who's murdered at least two women
and raped and tortured a third.
   As he investigates, Cooper always has a running monologue
going into a pocket tape recorder, a list of clues for his
secretary to type up ("Diane, I'm holding in my hand a box of
chocolate bunnies"). He's the kind of guy who asks for his
bacon "super crispy -- cremated."
   At the beginning of this week's episode, we find him
hanging upside down from a gravity bar, talking about "the
true test of any hotel, that morning cup of coffee," and
wondering about the one thing that still troubles him, not
just as an FBI man, but as a human being -- "what really went
on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?"
   If all this seems a little surreal, it's only because it
is. As reviewers have struggled to describe "Twin Peaks,"
they've been reduced to odd hybrid comparisons -- "Our Town"
by Franz Kafka, "Dark Shadows" meets "Falcon Crest." The best
description was by an ABC executive who called it "Norman
Rockwell Meets Salvador Dali," but even that's a little off.
   Instead of Dali, I would have picked Giorgio De Chirico,
surrealist painter of "The Sinister Muses." In his empty,
brooding pictures, there are strange shadows, the same aura
of danger that lies at the heart of "Twin Peaks."
   What Mr. Lynch does so well is to imbue something as
ordinary as small-town America with an inchoate threat, an ax
waiting to fall. In short, "Twin Peaks" is creepy. As Angelo
Badalamenti's music lurks underneath -- all cool and ominous
and 1950s vibes plus fingersnaps -- Mr. Lynch's camera will
rest on everyday objects: a fan, a fallen stag's head, even
an expressionless face. He'll focus in for three seconds,
four, five, six, so long it becomes positively unsettling.
Mr. Lynch understands the chilling quality of emptiness. Like
Harold Pinter, he knows that menace hangs in the silences.
   Even a conversation about curtains turns strangely
threatening: "Do you know what I was doing? . . . I was
inventing a noiseless, completely silent drape runner. And do
you know how it works, do you know what makes it work, the
thing that I thought of at four this morning when I was
waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care?
Cotton balls] By God, those things'll be quiet now]"
   Full of surprises and richly textured, "Twin Peaks" has a
level of production quality more commonly associated with a
feature film. But it is a quintessential TV product. Half
soap opera, half murder mystery, "Twin Peaks" co-opts, and
transforms, the two television genres. There are zillions of
characters (with a cast that includes Piper Laurie, Peggy
Lipton, Joan Chen, Dana Ashbrook, Lara Flynn Boyle, James
Marshall, Russ Tamblyn, Sherilyn Fenn) and almost as many
subplots. This is a vast, sprawling story, as tangled as any
soap, as packed with secret motives as any detective yarn.
   "Twin Peaks" is, however, more unforgiving than most TV
drama. It may take weeks just to get a sense of who all the
characters are and what's going on. And the mystery, instead
of getting clearer, just keeps getting murkier and murkier.
   But I'll tell you this: After two episodes, "Twin Peaks"
is riveting. And it's so cool, it's chilly.
