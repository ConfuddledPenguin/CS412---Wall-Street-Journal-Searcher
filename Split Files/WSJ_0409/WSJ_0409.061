   EAST AURORA, N.Y. -- Quaker Oats Co.'s Fisher-Price
division said as many as 20,000 Fisher-Price child car seats
made this year may be defective.
   Metal tongues, which go between the legs and connect with
shoulder safety straps, could break in a crash, Fisher-Price
said. It blamed the problem on a defective die at the
tongue's vendor, which Fisher-Price wouldn't identify.

   Fisher-Price said it had received no reports of injuries
or deaths because of the defect. A spokeswoman said the
division has substantial reserves to cover potential
liability. The financial impact on the third quarter, just
ended, should be "minimal."
   Opting for a part replacement plan rather than a recall,
Fisher-Price is making available free modification kits that
include a new tongue and tools to install it.
   The suspect car seats are model 9101 sold during February
and March. Seats with an inspection sticker dated April 1990
or later meet government safety standards, the company said.
Those wishing modification kits should call 800-327-9980
during business hours, Fisher-Price said.
