   BOSTON -- Three dissident shareholders of Grove Bank for
Savings said in a filing with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. that they intend to propose a resolution at the June 7
annual meeting calling for the sale of the bank.
   James B. Rosenwald and John H. and James J. Pinto -- who
own 8.16% of Grove Bank's 1.5 million shares outstanding --
said in a letter to the bank that they also intend to
recommend an increase in board membership from 15 to 19
directors because the current board isn't "maximizing the
value of shareholders' investment."

   The dissidents said they will nominate to the board Mr.
Rosenwald, chief executive officer of Rosenwald Partners L.P.
in Redondo Beach, Calif.; John Pinto, co-chief executive of
Churchill Associates L.P. of New York, N.Y.; Christopher P.
Sullivan, a lawyer; and Richard L. Morgenstern, a lawyer.
   Daniel Calore, treasurer of Grove, said, "The executive
committee of the board is planning to meet with this group
shortly. We really don't think we can comment until we sit
down and talk with them."
   For 1989, Grove Bank reported net of $1.3 million, or 88
cents a share, compared with 1988 net of $1.6 million, or
$1.06 a share. The company had assets of $211.4 million as of
Dec. 31.
