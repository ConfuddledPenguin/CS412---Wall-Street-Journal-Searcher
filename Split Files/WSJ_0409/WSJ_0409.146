   General Development Corp., short on cash and unable to pay
its property tax bills, said it filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami, put
the Miami-based developer and certain subsidiaries under the
court's protection while the company prepares a plan of
reorganization. Not covered in the filing are the company's
Vistana Resort and Glen Ivy subsidiaries, which operate
time-share resorts in Florida and the Western U.S.

   One of Florida's largest developers, General Development
has been roiled by legal troubles. After a two-year grand
jury investigation into selling practices, the company
pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to defraud
some 10,000 home buyers by charging inflated prices based on
improper appraisals. The company's former top two executives
also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy each.
   General Development said it didn't yet know what impact
the filing would have on its restitution plan in the
government's case. Under that plan, announced in March,
General Development agreed to repay homebuyers as much as
$100 million over 25 years.
   In recent months, General Development has struggled for
financial stability amid the investigation. The company first
laid off 500 workers. Then, General Development hired Charles
J. Simons, one of its outside directors and a former vice
chairman of Eastern Airlines, to succeed the two executives.
And, a week ago, the company closed its world-wide homesite
sales operations, firing 1,100 workers -- nearly one-quarter
of the payroll.
   But none of the moves could reverse the company's
financial strain. The bankruptcy-law filing "was necessary in
light of the company's inability to secure additional
financing to meet its short-term cash needs," said Mr.
Simons, the company's chairman and president.
   Last week, General Development said it couldn't complete
negotiations for a $60 million credit facility, leaving the
company unable to pay more than $10 million in property taxes
due April 1. As a result, General Development said it was
considering all options, including filing for federal
bankruptcy-law protection.
   Among the parties negotiating with General Development for
the fresh credit was Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
which holds a $75 million General Development note.
Prudential couldn't be reached yesterday to comment.
   General Development said it will prepare a plan of
reorganization to restructure debt, a process that will
likely take a number of months and will be done in
consultation with a committee of creditors. General
Development also said it asked the court for approval to pay
employees their regular paychecks.
   The company hasn't yet reported 1989 results. For the
first nine months, General Development earned $11.3 million,
or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $511.6 million.
   The bankruptcy-law filing was disclosed after the stock
market closed Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Friday, General Development fell 62.5 cents to $2.25.
