   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that Mexican
companies are exporting hydraulic cement to the U.S. at
unfairly low prices.
   The preliminary anti-dumping decision will require
importers of Mexican cement and clinker, an intermediate
material, to post bonds or make cash payments to cover
penalty duties that may be assessed later.

   The department's final ruling is due by June 19, after
which the U.S. International Trade Commission would decide
within 45 days whether the imports were injuring a domestic
industry. If both findings are affirmative, penalty duties
would be assessed.
   The department said the imports of cement and clinker
totaled about $111 million last year. The dumping margins,
and thus the potential duties, range as high as 56.68% for
cement produced by Cemex S.A.. The margin is 51.73% for
Apasco S.A. de C.V. and 51.16% for most other companies.
However, one Mexican producer, Cementos Hidalgo S.C.L.,
hasn't exported cement or clinker to the U.S. at unfairly low
prices, the agency said.
   Under the Anti-Dumping Act, the Commerce Department can
find a violation if imports are reaching the U.S. market at
prices below the producer's home-market price for the same
products.
