   TOKYO -- The Nikko Research Center said it lowered
slightly, to 3.9%, its estimate for Japanese gross national
product growth in the year ending March 1991.
   The center predicted domestic demand will fall off during
the second half of the fiscal year, as stock market
instability and higher interest rates cause private capital
investment and housing outlays to ease.

   Nikko Research predicts growth of private capital
investment will decline to 7.5% from an estimated 15.8% the
year before. The original prediction was for 8.0% growth.
