   PITTSBURGH -- Copperweld Corp. said it is calling for
redemption its 9.92% convertible subordinated debentures due
2008, effective April 23.
   The debenture call is part of an agreement under which
Imetal, a French steel concern, is to buy for $17 a share the
35% of Copperweld shares it doesn't already own. Copperweld
makes specialty metal products.
