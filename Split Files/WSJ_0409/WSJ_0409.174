   Active bargain-hunting pushed up Tokyo stock prices across
the board Friday, with the Nikkei index surging more than
1,000 points to close above the 29000-point level for the
first time since March 30.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 1,029.72
points to close at its intraday high of 29278.78. The index
declined 193.88 points Thursday.

   The Nikkei, after surging during the first hour of the
morning session, drifted at higher levels the rest of the
day.
   Traders said investors bought aggressively, deciding that
stock prices had fallen as far as they were going to when the
Nikkei fell as low as 27251 points intraday Thursday, down
30% since the beginning of this year.
   Buying interest was also supported by the relative
stability of the yen and bond prices Friday, traders said.
The market also welcomed the progress made at the fourth
round of the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative
(SII) talks, which closed in Washington Thursday.
   In Monday morning trading, the Nikkei rose sharply in
response to the yen's solid gains in foreign-exchange
markets. At the close of the morning session, the index
finished at 30165.45, up 886.67 points, or 3%, from Friday's
close.
   Volume on the first section Friday was estimated at 800
million shares, up from 658 million Thursday. Friday was the
first time since Dec. 27 that daily volume reached the 800
million-share level.
   A total of 732 issues advanced, while 75 issues fell and
30 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which lost 17.14 points Thursday, was
up 90.44 points, or 4.39%, to close at 2149.26.
   The second section index, which plunged 176.70 points
Thursday, gained 77.65 points, or 2.29%, to close at 3391.57.
Volume in the second section was estimated at 13 million
shares, up from 7.5 million Thursday.
   The market's strong advance Thursday afternoon from a
1,200-point intraday loss continued to provide a bullish mood
to the market Friday.
   Participants said, however, the market hasn't fully
discredited rumors that financially troubled speculator
groups have defaulted on payments to brokerage houses. The
rumors were the major factor behind Thursday's mid-day
plunge.
   "Investors are still feeling that their fears may come
true in the near future," said Fumihiko Ishii, manager of
investment research at Nomura Securities.
   That's part of the reason investors hurried to buy Friday,
when prices were low, so that they can take profits in the
near future.
   Mr. Ishii said Friday's gains were a technical rebound in
response to overselling over the past month.
   The largest winners were spread among the steel, mining,
construction and textile sectors.
   Nippon Steel went up 45 yen (29 cents) to 585 yen ($3.72),
while Mitsubishi Mining rose 90 to 660.
   Buying lifted both large and mid-sized construction
companies. Taisei gained 70 to 1,190. Sumitomo Construction
advanced 109 to 1,010 and Tokyu Construction was up 119 at
1,050.
   Electric utilities also rose sharply. Tokyo Electric Power
increased 250 to 3,980.
   Some pharmaceutical companies attracted investors who
considered their earnings prospects strong because they are
expected to unveil new products.
   Sankyo gained 170 to 2,600, while Mochida surged 400 to
3,800.
   London share prices finished lower Friday, as a
late-afternoon slide on the back of worries before the
weekend's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in Paris took its toll
on the market.
   Traders also said worries about the future viability of
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government upset
the market, and particularly the recently privatized
companies.
   In a Gallup poll published Friday, the Labor party had
52.5% support of those polled, and now holds a record
24.5-point lead over the Conservative party.
   Sterling's late-afternoon tumble also unnerved the market,
as internationals came in for a bout of selling, dealers
said. Market watchers said the G-7 meeting wasn't expected to
focus on the pound, so there were perceptions that sterling
would be neglected in the aftermath of the meeting.
   At the close, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was down 18.4 points at 2221.1, and
just a shade better than its 2221 minimum. The index hit an
early-morning peak of 2243.2 and proceeded to move lower
throughout the rest of the session.
   The narrower FT 30-share index was down 16.1 points at
1740.2. Volume amounted to a moderately active 578.6 million
shares, compared with the 499.5 million that changed hands
Thursday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2242.0, down from its settlement level of 2271.0
Thursday.
   Wall Street, if anything, provided an additional negative
bias for London stocks, dealers said. By the end of the
European day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 15.54
points at 2705.63.
   The opinion polls hit the privatization stocks. Thames
Water dropped 4 pence (7 cents) to 138 ($2.27), and the
package of water stocks shed 38 to #14.50 ($23.82). British
Telecom lost 2.5 to 263.5, while British Gas slipped .5 to
205.
   Among the internationals that were unhinged by political
events and a weakness in sterling were Glaxo Holdings, off 13
to 785; Imperial Chemical Industries, down 11 to #10.84; BOC
Group, off 9 to 520, and British Aerospace, down 9 to 519.
   Elsewhere around the market, diversified conglomerate
B.A.T Industries shed 42 to 743 as the spinoff of its retail
company, Argos, began official trading on the London Stock
Exchange. Argos's debut, however, was less than stellar and
its shares dropped 2 to 202.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Paris, Zurich,
Stockholm and Milan; mixed in Brussels and lower in
Frankfurt. The Johannesburg stock exchange was closed for a
holiday.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Seoul and
Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and Manila and lower in
Singapore and Taipei.
