   NEW YORK -- If it hadn't been for professional baseball's
32-day lockout, pious Jewish fans of the Toronto Blue Jays
wouldn't have been in such a tizzy.
   The Blue Jays had been scheduled for an off-day today. But
the week-long delay in the baseball season's opening has sent
them to Arlington to play the Texas Rangers tonight. Both
teams would then fly to Toronto for what was rescheduled as
an afternoon game tomorrow.

   But that would violate a players' association rule: No
team can play a day game on the day after a night game if
that would require an airplane flight of more than 90
minutes.
   So tomorrow's game was again rescheduled, for tomorrow
night -- when many Jewish ticketholders will be observing the
Seder, or Passover supper, at home. In a four-day period, the
Blue Jays got 150 telephone calls complaining of the
conflict. "It's caused quite a stir here," says Gary Oswald,
a spokesman for the team.
   The Blue Jays have decided to offer refunds to the
frustrated ticketholders, but that isn't the end of their
scheduling woes. Another rescheduled game with the Rangers is
set now for Aug. 6. That, however, would mean games on 21
successive days for the Blue Jays, and the players'
association rules require a day off after 20. In this case,
the association is being asked to waive the rule.
   Multiply such problems by the major leagues' 26 teams,
each of which can gain a financial edge in advantageous
scheduling, and you get an idea why baseball scheduling is
too complicated to trust to computers.
   The job largely falls instead on a soft-spoken,
publicity-shy married couple on New York's Staten Island,
Henry and Holly Stephenson. Few fans have heard of them, and
the Stephensons would just as soon keep it that way; they
have troubles enough satisfying people like George
Steinbrenner. The Stephensons only reluctantly discuss their
job with an outsider.
   Their firm, Stephenson Systems Co., spends about eight
months a year scheduling 2,106 baseball games under a
contract with Major League Baseball, a league organization
headed by the commissioner. Nobody involved will say how much
the contract is worth, except that it is less than $1 million
a year.
   Scheduling a season is tough enough. Changing a single
game is something like pulling an orange from the bottom of a
neatly stacked pile in a grocery.
   In 1987, the Montreal Expos were to play in a new stadium,
but nobody knew whether it would be finished in time for the
opener. So the Stephensons put Montreal on the road for the
first two weeks, confounding the schedules of at least three
other National League East teams.
   One was the Pittsburgh Pirates. They usually enjoy a
preponderance of home games in June, when warm weather draws
larger crowds. The revised schedule meant more home games in
chilly April. "It severely hurt our attendance," says Bernie
Mullin, a Pirate executive. "The schedule can make a
tremendous difference" in attendance and revenue.
   The Stephensons try not to resort to doubleheaders to make
up for lost days. Owners dislike them because they generate
less revenue than two single games. This year's season delay
will mean more doubleheaders than usual, though.
   Mr. Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York Yankees,
has groused for years about American League scheduling. The
Yanks draw bigger home crowds against old rivals like Boston
and Baltimore, especially in the summer, than when they play
some newer teams. "I don't like the way scheduling has been
done, and not many are completely satisfied," says Mr.
Steinbrenner, though he concedes the Yankees are getting a
fair shake in heavy-drawing home games this summer.
   In the American League, after the Stephensons turn in
their draft schedule, most of the complaints from
dissatisfied teams come to the league's scheduling committee.
Dick Wagner, a special assistant in Major League Baseball,
was fielding calls in his office last month, when the first
week of the regular season still had to be rescheduled. "I'm
not Houdini, chief," he told one caller. "I'm sorry to do
this to you, but everybody's going to be hurt."
   Long before opening day, questionnaires sent to the major
league teams give them a chance to make special requests.
   The Expos and the Toronto Blue Jays always want to play in
the U.S. on July Fourth, but not on July 1, which is Canada
Day. The Boston Red Sox have always played at home on
Patriots' Day in Massachusetts. The Minnesota Twins always
want to be away on the third weekend of May. Might as well
be; it's the opening day of wall-eye season.
   In New York, the Mets want to be home when the Yankees are
away, and the Yankees want to be home when the Mets are away.
The same is true for the other two-team places, Chicago, San
Francisco-Oakland, and Los Angeles-Anaheim. "They don't
always get what they want," Mrs. Stephenson says.
   In 1984, the Texas Rangers asked to be home when the
Republican convention kicked off in Dallas, to attract
convention-goers. But in San Francisco, site of the
Democratic convention, the Giants asked to be put on the
road, partly to avoid congestion. Also, the All-Star game
would be played in San Francisco the preceding week, making
the Giants games that would follow seem anticlimactic. Both
teams got what they wanted.
   In many stadiums, baseball isn't the only thing going on.
There are also rock concerts, trade shows and professional
football. The conflicts keep cropping up to make things tough
for the schedulers. That often means they have to do another
version of the schedule. "We did up to 14 in one year," Mrs.
Stephenson says.
   The Stephensons were living in Greenwich Village and
writing software as New York City employees in the 1970s when
by chance they met George Faust Sr., father of a friend. Mr.
Faust, then director of broadcasting for the National
Basketball Association, mentioned that the NBA was having a
hard time finding somebody to program its schedule on a
computer. It was then being done entirely by hand by
80-year-old Steve Gottlieb, who was preparing to retire.
   A year later, the Stephensons, who yearned to start their
own business, volunteered for the job. They soon learned
there was no way to do a schedule entirely by computer.
   In 1981 they were offered the Major League Baseball
contract. They also scheduled the now-defunct North American
Soccer League and still do the Major Indoor Soccer League.
The NBA now does its own scheduling, though.
   From the time the Stephensons start the schedule in
December until they turn in a rough draft a few months later,
they are always working a season ahead. The next four months,
they work with league scheduling committees to review and
revise.
   Teams that get bad breaks one season usually get favored
treatment the next. The Stephensons and the committees stick
to the system they know best, a mixture of pencil and paper
and computer, arranging blocks of games in repeating patterns
and then resolving the inevitable conflicts with owner
demands, players-association rules and competing events.
   So far as the Stephensons are concerned, the 1990 season
is ancient history now. They're busy working on 1991.
